He began writing it in 1953; the novel was first published in 1961. Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century,<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1868619.stm |title=What is Catch-22? And why does the book matter? |work=BBC News |date=March 12, 2002 |accessdate=March 11, 2011}}</ref> it uses a distinctive non-chronological [[Narrative mode#Third-person.2C omniscient|third-person omniscient]] narration, describing events from the points of view of different characters. The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot.\n\nThe novel is set during World War II, from 1942 to 1944. It mainly follows the life of [[antihero]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[John Yossarian]], a [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] [[B-25]] [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]]. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th US Army Air Squadron is based on the island of [[Pianosa]], in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], west of Italy, though it also covers episodes from basic training at Lowry Field in Colorado and Air Corps training in Santa Ana, CA. The novel examines the [[absurdity]] of war and military life through the experiences of Yossarian and his cohorts, who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home.\n\nIn 1994 Heller published a sequel, ''[[Closing Time (novel)|Closing Time]]''.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nThe development of the novel can be split into segments. The first (chapters 1\u201311) broadly follows the story fragmented between characters, but in a single chronological time in 1944. The second (chapters 12\u201320) flashes back to focus primarily on the \"Great Big Siege of [[Bologna]]\" before once again jumping to the chronological present of 1944 in the third part (chapter 21\u201325). The fourth (chapters 26\u201328) flashes back to the origins and growth of [[Milo Minderbinder|Milo's]] syndicate, with the fifth part (chapter 28\u201332) returning again to the narrative present and maintaining the tone of the previous four. The sixth and final part (chapter 32 and on) remains in the story's present, but takes a much darker turn and spends the remaining chapters focusing on the serious and brutal nature of war and life in general.<ref name=Burhans>Clinton S.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/440541 JSTOR online access]</ref>\nPreviously the reader had been cushioned from experiencing the full horror of events, but in the final section, the events are laid bare. The horror begins with the attack on the undefended Italian mountain village, with the following chapters involving despair ([[Doc Daneeka]] and the [[Chaplain Tappman|Chaplain]]), disappearance in combat ([[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] and Clevinger), disappearance caused by the army (Dunbar) or death of most of [[Yossarian]]'s friends ([[Nately]], McWatt, Kid Sampson, Dobbs, Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe), culminating in the horrors of Chapter 39, in particular the rape and murder of the innocent young woman, [[Aarfy#Michaela|Michaela]].<ref name=Burhans/> In Chapter 41 the full details of the gruesome death of [[Yossarian#Snowden|Snowden]] are finally revealed.\n\nNevertheless, the novel ends on an upbeat note with Yossarian learning of [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr's]] miraculous escape to Sweden and Yossarian's pledge to follow him there.\n\n== Style ==\nMany events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about each event from each iteration, with the new information often completing a joke, the setup of which was told several chapters previously. The narrative's events are out of sequence, but events are referred to as if the reader is already familiar with them so that the reader must ultimately piece together a timeline of events. Specific words, phrases, and questions are also repeated frequently, generally to comic effect.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nMuch of Heller's prose in ''Catch-22'' is circular and repetitive, exemplifying in its form the structure of a ''[[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]''. [[Circular reasoning]] is widely used by some characters to justify their actions and opinions. Heller revels in [[paradox]], for example: \"[[The Texan (fictional character)|The Texan]] turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him\", and \"The case against Clevinger was open and shut. The only thing missing was something to charge him with.\" This atmosphere of apparently logical irrationality pervades the book.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nWhile a few characters are most prominent, especially Yossarian and the Chaplain, the majority of named characters are described in detail with fleshed out or multidimensional personas to the extent that there are few if any \"minor characters\". There are no traditional heroes in the novel, reflecting the underlying commentary that war has no heroes, only victims.<ref name=\"Rosenbaum\">{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2011/08/catch-22-the-awful-truth-people-miss-about-heller-s-great-novel.html|title=Catch-22: The awful truth people miss about Heller's great novel.|last=Rosenbaum|first=Ron|date=2011-08-02|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref>\n\nAlthough its non-chronological structure may at first seem random, ''Catch-22'' is highly structured. It is founded on a structure of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]]; ideas run into one another through seemingly random connections. For example, Chapter 1, titled \"The Texan\", ends with \"everybody but the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|CID man]], who had caught a cold from the fighter captain and come down with pneumonia.\"<ref name=\"Catch-22\">{{cite book | first=Joseph | last=Heller | title=Catch-22 | publisher=Simon & Schuster | location=New York | date=June 1961 | orig-year=1961 | isbn=0-684-83339-5 | oclc=35231812 | type=hardback | url=https://archive.org/details/catch2200hell_0 }}</ref>{{rp|24}} Chapter 2, titled \"Clevinger\", begins with \"In a way, the CID man was pretty lucky because outside the hospital the war was still going on.\"<ref name=\"Catch-22\"/>{{rp|25}} The CID man connects the two chapters like a free association bridge and eventually Chapter 2 flows from the CID man to Clevinger through more free association links.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Paradox ===\n[[Yossarian]] comes to fear his commanding officers more than he fears the Germans attempting to shoot him down and he feels that \"they\" are \"out to get him\". The reason Yossarian fears his commanders more than the enemy is that as he flies more missions, [[Colonel Cathcart]] increases the number of required combat missions before a soldier may return home; he reaches the magic number only to have it retroactively raised. He comes to despair of ever getting home and is greatly relieved when he is sent to the hospital for a condition that is almost [[jaundice]]. In Yossarian's words:\n\n: The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which ''side'' he's on, and that includes Colonel Cathcart. And don't you forget that, because the longer you remember it, the longer you might live.<ref name=\"Catch-22\" />{{rp|124}}\n\n=== Tragedy and farce ===\nMuch of the farce in the novel is fueled by intentional and unintentional miscommunication, occasionally leading to tragic consequences. For example, Cathcart's desire to become a general is thwarted by ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen sabotaging his correspondence. Major Major's and Yossarian's mis-censoring of correspondence is blamed on the Chaplain, who is threatened with imprisonment as a result.\n\n=== Theodicy ===\nYossarian questions the idea that God is all-powerful, all-good, and all knowing. The narrator seems to believe that God, if not evil, is incompetent. In chapter 18, Yossarian states that he \"believes in the God he doesn't believe in\", this version of God having created Hitler, the war, and all the failures of human life and society, as exemplified in the following passage:<blockquote>\"And don\u2019t tell me God works in mysterious ways\", Yossarian continued, hurtling over her objections. \"There's nothing so mysterious about it. He\u2019s not working at all. He\u2019s playing or else He\u2019s forgotten all about us. That\u2019s the kind of God you people talk about\u2014a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did he ever create pain? \u2026 Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain! [to warn us of danger] Why couldn't He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of His celestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person's forehead. Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn't He? \u2026 What a colossal, immortal blunderer! When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly little mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. \u2026\"<ref name=\"Rosenbaum\"/></blockquote>Later Heller writes of Yossarian wandering through a war-torn Italian city (Chapter 39):  <blockquote>\"Yossarian quickened his pace to get away, almost ran. The night was filled with horrors, and he thought he knew how Christ must have felt as he walked through the world, like a psychiatrist through a ward full of nuts, like a victim through a prison full of thieves. What a welcome sight a leper must have been. At the next corner a man was beating a small boy brutally in the midst of an immobile crowd of adult spectators who made no effort to intervene...\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Catch-22|last=Heller|first=Joseph|publisher=Random House|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-43722-2|location=|pages=514}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Anti-capitalism ===\nWhile the military's enemies are Germans, none appears in the story as an enemy combatant. This ironic situation is epitomized in the single appearance of German personnel in the novel, who act as pilots employed by the squadron's Mess Officer, [[Milo Minderbinder]], to bomb the American encampment on Pianosa. This predicament indicates a tension between traditional motives for violence and the modern economic machine, which seems to generate violence simply as another means to profit, quite independent of geographical or ideological constraints which creates a [[military\u2013industrial complex]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/book-reviews-tuesday-tome-catch-22-joseph-heller/|title=Rocks and Hard Places Galore: The Bureaucratic Appropriation of War in Joseph Heller's Catch-22|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=October 27, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|series=Your Tuesday Tome|publisher=|access-date=February 21, 2016}}</ref> Heller emphasizes the danger of profit-seeking by portraying Milo without \"evil intent.\" Milo's actions are portrayed as the result of greed, not malice.<ref name=\"Sorkin 1993 150\">{{cite book|title=Conversations with Joseph Heller|last=Sorkin|first=Adam J.|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1993|isbn=0-87805-635-1|location=Jackson, MO|pages=150}}</ref>\n\n\n== Characters ==\n{{Further|List of Catch-22 characters}}\n\n== Influences ==\nHeller wanted to be a writer from an early age. His experiences as a [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] during World War II inspired ''Catch-22'';<ref>{{cite magazine | first=DM | last=Craig | title=From Avignon to Catch-22 | magazine=War, Literature, and the Arts 6 | issue=2 | date=1994 | pages=27\u201354}}</ref> Heller later said that he \"never had a bad officer\". In a 1977 essay on ''Catch-22'', Heller stated that the \"antiwar and antigovernment feelings in the book\" were a product of the Korean War and the 1950s rather than World War II itself. Heller's criticisms are not intended for World War II but for the Cold War and [[McCarthyism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Joseph|title=The Sixties|year=1977|publisher=Random House/Rolling Stone Press|location=New York|editor=Lynda Rosen Obst|pages=50\u201352|chapter=Reeling in Catch-22}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of the 1950s on ''Catch-22'' is evident through Heller's extensive use of [[anachronism]]. Though the novel is ostensibly set in World War II, Heller intentionally included anachronisms like [[loyalty oaths]] and [[computers]] (IBM machines) to situate the novel in the context of the 1950s.<ref name=\"Sorkin 1993 150\"/>  Many of the characters are based on or connected to individuals from the 1950s:\n*Milo Minderbinder's maxim \"What's good for M&M Enterprises is good for the country\" alludes to the former president of [[General Motors]] [[Charles Erwin Wilson]]'s statement before the Senate: \"What's good for General Motors is good for the country.\"<ref name=\"Sorkin 1993 150\"/>\n*The question of \"Who promoted [[Major Major Major Major|Major Major]]?\" alludes to [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s questioning of the promotion of [[Irving Peress|Major Peress]], an army dentist who refused to sign loyalty oaths.<ref name=\"Sorkin 1993 150\"/>\n\nCzech writer [[Arno\u0161t Lustig]] recounts in his book ''3x18'' that Joseph Heller told him that he would never have written ''Catch-22'' had he not first read ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]]'' by [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Zenny Sadlon |url=http://www.zenny.com/Heller.html |title=Personal testimony by Arno\u0161t Lustig |publisher=Zenny.com |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, some critics raised the possibility that Heller's book had questionable similarities to [[Louis Falstein]]'s 1950 novel, ''[[Face of a Hero]]''. Falstein never raised the issue between ''Catch-22'''s publication and his death in 1995 and Heller claimed never to have been aware of the obscure novel. Heller said that the novel had been influenced by [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]], [[Evelyn Waugh|Waugh]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]. Many of the similarities have been stated to be attributable to the authors' experiences, both having served as U.S. Army Air Forces aircrew in Italy in World War II. However, their themes and styles are different.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/29/books/critic-s-notebook-questioning-the-provenance-of-the-iconic-catch-22.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |title= Critic's Notebook; Questioning the Provenance of the Iconic ''Catch-22'' |first= Mel |last= Gussow |date= April 29, 1998 |accessdate= April 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Concept ==\nA \"[[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]\" is \"a problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule.\"<ref>catch-22, Merriam-Webster. Retrieved March 8, 2012 http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catch%2022</ref> For example, losing something is typically a conventional problem; to solve it, one looks for the lost item until one finds it. But if the thing lost is one's glasses, one cannot see to look for them &mdash; a Catch-22. The term \"Catch-22\" is also used more broadly to mean a tricky problem or a no-win or absurd situation.\n\nIn the book, Catch-22 is a military rule typifying [[bureaucratic]] operation and reasoning. The rule is not stated in a precise form, but the principal example in the book fits the definition above: If one is crazy, one does not have to fly missions; and one must be crazy to fly. But one has to apply to be excused, and applying demonstrates that one is not crazy. As a result, one must continue flying, either not applying to be excused, or applying and being refused. The narrator explains:\n\n<blockquote>There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to, but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. (p. 56, ch. 5)</blockquote>\n\nOther forms of Catch-22 are invoked throughout the novel to justify various bureaucratic actions. At one point, victims of harassment by military police quote the MPs' explanation of one of Catch-22's provisions: \"Catch-22 states that agents enforcing Catch-22 need not prove that Catch-22 actually contains whatever provision the accused violator is accused of violating.\" Another character explains: \"Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.\"\n\nYossarian comes to realize that Catch-22 does not actually exist, but because the powers that be claim it does, and the world believes it does, it nevertheless has potent effects. Indeed, because it does not exist, there is no way it can be repealed, undone, overthrown, or denounced. The combination of force with specious and spurious legalistic justification is one of the book's primary motifs.\n\nThe motif of bureaucratic absurdity is further explored in 1994's [[Closing Time (novel)|''Closing Time'']], Heller's sequel to ''Catch-22''. This darker, slower-paced, apocalyptic novel explores the pre- and post-war lives of some of the major characters in ''Catch-22'', with particular emphasis on the relationship between Yossarian and tail gunner Sammy Singer.\n\n== Literary allusions ==\n''Catch-22'' contains allusions to many works of literature. [[Howard Jacobson]], in his 2004 introduction to the Vintage Classics publication, wrote that the novel was \"positioned teasingly ... between literature and literature's opposites&nbsp;\u2013 between [[Shakespeare]] and [[Rabelais]] and [[Dickens]] and [[Dostoevsky]] and [[Gogol]] and [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]] and the [[Absurdism|Absurdists]] and of course [[Kafka]] on the one hand, and on the other [[vaudeville]] and [[slapstick]] and [[The Phil Silvers Show|Bilko]] and [[Abbott and Costello]] and [[Tom and Jerry]] and [[the Goons]] (if Heller had ever heard of the Goons).\"<ref>[[Random House]] {{ISBN|978-0-09-947046-5}} [http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/vintage/classics/home.htm Vintage Classics]</ref>\nOne critic argues that it is Kafka's influence that can be seen most strongly in the novel:  \"Like Kafka's heroes, Yossarian is riddled with anxiety and caught in an inexorable nightmare \u2013 in his case created by Colonel Cathcart and the inevitability of his raising the number of missions he has to fly.\"<ref>[http://www.humanities-ebooks.co.uk/book/Reading_Catch-22 McDonald, Paul. ''Reading Catch-22.'' Humanities E-Books]</ref>\n\n== Historical context ==\n\nThe idea for ''Catch-22'' was based on Joseph Heller's personal experience in World War II. The feelings that Yossarian and the other bomber pilots felt were taken directly from problems he suffered while on duty. Heller flew 60 bombing missions from May to October in 1944. Heller was able to make it out of the war, but it took until 1953 before he could start writing about it. For this reason, the book contains references to post World War II phenomena like IBM computers and [[loyalty oath]]s. The war experience turned Heller into a \"tortured, funny, deeply peculiar human being\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Bailey|first=Blake|title=The Enigma of Joseph Heller|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/books/review/the-enigma-of-joseph-heller.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=bookreviews|accessdate=May 7, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter publication in 1961, ''Catch-22'' became very popular among teenagers at the time. ''Catch-22'' seemed to embody the feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of ''Catch-22''. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States. On October 26, 1986, professor and author [[John W. Aldridge]] wrote a piece in ''[[The New York Times]]'' celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publishing of \"Catch-22\". He commented that Heller's book presaged the chaos in the world that was to come:\n\n<blockquote>The comic fable that ends in horror has become more and more clearly a reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities of the world in which we live and hope to survive.<ref>{{cite news|last=Aldridge|first=John W.|title=The Loony Horror of it all - ''Catch-22'' Turns 25|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/15/home/heller-loony.html|accessdate=March 1, 2018|newspaper=Sunday New York Times|date=October 26, 1986}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough ''Catch-22'' is considered by many to be an [[anti-war novel]], Heller stated in a talk he gave at the [[New York Public Library]] on August 31, 1998 that he and the other men he knew in World War II considered the war to be \"noble\" and \"nobody really objected to fighting it\". The anti-war reputation of the novel was fueled instead by the pacifist, anti-war ethos among young Americans surrounding the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n== Title ==\n\nThe title is a reference to a fictional bureaucratic stipulation which embodies forms of illogical and immoral reasoning.<ref name=\":0\" /> The opening chapter of the novel was originally published in ''[[New World Writing]]'' as ''Catch-18'' in 1955, but Heller's agent, Candida Donadio, requested that he change the title of the novel, so it would not be confused with another recently published World War II novel, [[Leon Uris]]'s ''[[Mila 18]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> The number [[18 (number)|18]] has special meaning in Judaism (it means ''Alive'' in [[Gematria]]; see [[Chai (symbol)|Chai]]) and was relevant to early drafts of the novel which had a somewhat greater Jewish emphasis.<ref name=\"title\">N James. \"The Early Composition History of Catch-22\".

He began writing it in 1953; the novel was first published in 1961. Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century,<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1868619.stm |title=What is Catch-22? And why does the book matter? |work=BBC News |date=March 12, 2002 |accessdate=March 11, 2011}}</ref> it uses a distinctive non-chronological [[Narrative mode#Third-person.2C omniscient|third-person omniscient]] narration, describing events from the points of view of different characters. The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot.\n\nThe novel is set during World War II, from 1942 to 1944. It mainly follows the life of [[antihero]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[John Yossarian]], a [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] [[B-25]] [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]]. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th US Army Air Squadron is based on the island of [[Pianosa]], in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], west of Italy, though it also covers episodes from basic training at Lowry Field in Colorado and Air Corps training in Santa Ana, CA. The novel examines the [[absurdity]] of war and military life through the experiences of Yossarian and his cohorts, who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home.\n\nIn 1994 Heller published a sequel, ''[[Closing Time (novel)|Closing Time]]''.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nThe development of the novel can be split into segments. The first (chapters 1\u201311) broadly follows the story fragmented between characters, but in a single chronological time in 1944. The second (chapters 12\u201320) flashes back to focus primarily on the \"Great Big Siege of [[Bologna]]\" before once again jumping to the chronological present of 1944 in the third part (chapter 21\u201325). The fourth (chapters 26\u201328) flashes back to the origins and growth of [[Milo Minderbinder|Milo's]] syndicate, with the fifth part (chapter 28\u201332) returning again to the narrative present and maintaining the tone of the previous four. The sixth and final part (chapter 32 and on) remains in the story's present, but takes a much darker turn and spends the remaining chapters focusing on the serious and brutal nature of war and life in general.<ref name=Burhans>Clinton S. Burhans, Jr. ''Spindrift and the Sea: Structural Patterns and Unifying Elements in Catch 22.'' Twentieth Century Literature, Vol. 19, No. 4, pp. 239\u2013250, 1973. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/440541 JSTOR online access]</ref>\nPreviously the reader had been cushioned from experiencing the full horror of events, but in the final section, the events are laid bare. The horror begins with the attack on the undefended Italian mountain village, with the following chapters involving despair ([[Doc Daneeka]] and the [[Chaplain Tappman|Chaplain]]), disappearance in combat ([[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] and Clevinger), disappearance caused by the army (Dunbar) or death of most of [[Yossarian]]'s friends ([[Nately]], McWatt, Kid Sampson, Dobbs, Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe), culminating in the horrors of Chapter 39, in particular the rape and murder of the innocent young woman, [[Aarfy#Michaela|Michaela]].<ref name=Burhans/> In Chapter 41 the full details of the gruesome death of [[Yossarian#Snowden|Snowden]] are finally revealed.\n\nNevertheless, the novel ends on an upbeat note with Yossarian learning of [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr's]] miraculous escape to Sweden and Yossarian's pledge to follow him there.\n\n== Style ==\nMany events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about each event from each iteration, with the new information often completing a joke, the setup of which was told several chapters previously. The narrative's events are out of sequence, but events are referred to as if the reader is already familiar with them so that the reader must ultimately piece together a timeline of events. Specific words, phrases, and questions are also repeated frequently, generally to comic effect.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nMuch of Heller's prose in ''Catch-22'' is circular and repetitive, exemplifying in its form the structure of a ''[[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]''. [[Circular reasoning]] is widely used by some characters to justify their actions and opinions. Heller revels in [[paradox]], for example: \"[[The Texan (fictional character)|The Texan]] turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him\", and \"The case against Clevinger was open and shut. The only thing missing was something to charge him with.\" This atmosphere of apparently logical irrationality pervades the book.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nWhile a few characters are most prominent, especially Yossarian and the Chaplain, the majority of named characters are described in detail with fleshed out or multidimensional personas to the extent that there are few if any \"minor characters\". There are no traditional heroes in the novel, reflecting the underlying commentary that war has no heroes, only victims.<ref name=\"Rosenbaum\">{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2011/08/catch-22-the-awful-truth-people-miss-about-heller-s-great-novel.html|title=Catch-22: The awful truth people miss about Heller's great novel.|last=Rosenbaum|first=Ron|date=2011-08-02|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref>\n\nAlthough its non-chronological structure may at first seem random, ''Catch-22'' is highly structured. It is founded on a structure of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]]; ideas run into one another through seemingly random connections. For example, Chapter 1, titled \"The Texan\", ends with \"everybody but the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|CID man]], who had caught a cold from the fighter captain and come down with pneumonia.\"<ref name=\"Catch-22\">{{cite book | first=Joseph | last=Heller | title=Catch-22 | publisher=Simon & Schuster | location=New York | date=June 1961 | orig-year=1961 | isbn=0-684-83339-5 | oclc=35231812 | type=hardback | url=https://archive.org/details/catch2200hell_0 }}</ref>{{rp|24}} Chapter 2, titled \"Clevinger\", begins with \"In a way, the CID man was pretty lucky because outside the hospital the war was still going on.\"<ref name=\"Catch-22\"/>{{rp|25}} The CID man connects the two chapters like a free association bridge and eventually Chapter 2 flows from the CID man to Clevinger through more free association links.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Paradox ===\n[[Yossarian]] comes to fear his commanding officers more than he fears the Germans attempting to shoot him down and he feels that \"they\" are \"out to get him\". The reason Yossarian fears his commanders more than the enemy is that as he flies more missions, [[Colonel Cathcart]] increases the number of required combat missions before a soldier may return home; he reaches the magic number only to have it retroactively raised. He comes to despair of ever getting home and is greatly relieved when he is sent to the hospital for a condition that is almost [[jaundice]]. In Yossarian's words:\n\n: The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which ''side'' he's on, and that includes Colonel Cathcart. And don't you forget that, because the longer you remember it, the longer you might live.<ref name=\"Catch-22\" />{{rp|124}}\n\n=== Tragedy and farce ===\nMuch of the farce in the novel is fueled by intentional and unintentional miscommunication, occasionally leading to tragic consequences. For example, Cathcart's desire to become a general is thwarted by ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen sabotaging his correspondence. Major Major's and Yossarian's mis-censoring of correspondence is blamed on the Chaplain, who is threatened with imprisonment as a result.\n\n=== Theodicy ===\nYossarian questions the idea that God is all-powerful, all-good, and all knowing. The narrator seems to believe that God, if not evil, is incompetent. In chapter 18, Yossarian states that he \"believes in the God he doesn't believe in\", this version of God having created Hitler, the war, and all the failures of human life and society, as exemplified in the following passage:<blockquote>\"And don\u2019t tell me God works in mysterious ways\", Yossarian continued, hurtling over her objections. \"There's nothing so mysterious about it. He\u2019s not working at all. He\u2019s playing or else He\u2019s forgotten all about us. That\u2019s the kind of God you people talk about\u2014a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did he ever create pain? \u2026 Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain! [to warn us of danger] Why couldn't He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of His celestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person's forehead. Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn't He? \u2026 What a colossal, immortal blunderer! When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly little mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. \u2026\"<ref name=\"Rosenbaum\"/></blockquote>Later Heller writes of Yossarian wandering through a war-torn Italian city (Chapter 39):  <blockquote>\"Yossarian quickened his pace to get away, almost ran. The night was filled with horrors, and he thought he knew how Christ must have felt as he walked through the world, like a psychiatrist through a ward full of nuts, like a victim through a prison full of thieves. What a welcome sight a leper must have been. At the next corner a man was beating a small boy brutally in the midst of an immobile crowd of adult spectators who made no effort to intervene...\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Catch-22|last=Heller|first=Joseph|publisher=Random House|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-43722-2|location=|pages=514}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Anti-capitalism ===\nWhile the military's enemies are Germans, none appears in the story as an enemy combatant. This ironic situation is epitomized in the single appearance of German personnel in the novel, who act as pilots employed by the squadron's Mess Officer, [[Milo Minderbinder]], to bomb the American encampment on Pianosa. This predicament indicates a tension between traditional motives for violence and the modern economic machine, which seems to generate violence simply as another means to profit, quite independent of geographical or ideological constraints which creates a [[military\u2013industrial complex]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/book-reviews-tuesday-tome-catch-22-joseph-heller/|title=Rocks and Hard Places Galore: The Bureaucratic Appropriation of War in Joseph Heller's Catch-22|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=October 27, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|series=Your Tuesday Tome|publisher=|access-date=February 21, 2016}}</ref> Heller emphasizes the danger of profit-seeking by portraying Milo without \"evil intent.\" Milo's actions are portrayed as the result of greed, not malice.<ref name=\"Sorkin 1993 150\">{{cite book|title=Conversations with Joseph Heller|last=Sorkin|first=Adam J.|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1993|isbn=0-87805-635-1|location=Jackson, MO|pages=150}}</ref>\n\n\n== Characters ==\n{{Further|List of Catch-22 characters}}\n\n== Influences ==\nHeller wanted to be a writer from an early age.

In a 1977 essay on ''Catch-22'', Heller stated that the \"antiwar and antigovernment feelings in the book\" were a product of the Korean War and the 1950s rather than World War II itself. Heller's criticisms are not intended for World War II but for the Cold War and [[McCarthyism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Joseph|title=The Sixties|year=1977|publisher=Random House/Rolling Stone Press|location=New York|editor=Lynda Rosen Obst|pages=50\u201352|chapter=Reeling in Catch-22}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of the 1950s on ''Catch-22'' is evident through Heller's extensive use of [[anachronism]]. Though the novel is ostensibly set in World War II, Heller intentionally included anachronisms like [[loyalty oaths]] and [[computers]] (IBM machines) to situate the novel in the context of the 1950s.<ref name=\"Sorkin 1993 150\"/>  Many of the characters are based on or connected to individuals from the 1950s:\n*Milo Minderbinder's maxim \"What's good for M&M Enterprises is good for the country\" alludes to the former president of [[General Motors]] [[Charles Erwin Wilson]]'s statement before the Senate: \"What's good for General Motors is good for the country.\"<ref name=\"Sorkin 1993 150\"/>\n*The question of \"Who promoted [[Major Major Major Major|Major Major]]?\" alludes to [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s questioning of the promotion of [[Irving Peress|Major Peress]], an army dentist who refused to sign loyalty oaths.<ref name=\"Sorkin 1993 150\"/>\n\nCzech writer [[Arno\u0161t Lustig]] recounts in his book ''3x18'' that Joseph Heller told him that he would never have written ''Catch-22'' had he not first read ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]]'' by [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Zenny Sadlon |url=http://www.zenny.com/Heller.html |title=Personal testimony by Arno\u0161t Lustig |publisher=Zenny.com |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, some critics raised the possibility that Heller's book had questionable similarities to [[Louis Falstein]]'s 1950 novel, ''[[Face of a Hero]]''. Falstein never raised the issue between ''Catch-22'''s publication and his death in 1995 and Heller claimed never to have been aware of the obscure novel. Heller said that the novel had been influenced by [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]], [[Evelyn Waugh|Waugh]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]. Many of the similarities have been stated to be attributable to the authors' experiences, both having served as U.S. Army Air Forces aircrew in Italy in World War II. However, their themes and styles are different.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/29/books/critic-s-notebook-questioning-the-provenance-of-the-iconic-catch-22.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |title= Critic's Notebook; Questioning the Provenance of the Iconic ''Catch-22'' |first= Mel |last= Gussow |date= April 29, 1998 |accessdate= April 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Concept ==\nA \"[[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]\" is \"a problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule.\"<ref>catch-22, Merriam-Webster. Retrieved March 8, 2012 http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catch%2022</ref> For example, losing something is typically a conventional problem; to solve it, one looks for the lost item until one finds it. But if the thing lost is one's glasses, one cannot see to look for them &mdash; a Catch-22. The term \"Catch-22\" is also used more broadly to mean a tricky problem or a no-win or absurd situation.\n\nIn the book, Catch-22 is a military rule typifying [[bureaucratic]] operation and reasoning. The rule is not stated in a precise form, but the principal example in the book fits the definition above: If one is crazy, one does not have to fly missions; and one must be crazy to fly. But one has to apply to be excused, and applying demonstrates that one is not crazy. As a result, one must continue flying, either not applying to be excused, or applying and being refused. The narrator explains:\n\n<blockquote>There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to, but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. (p. 56, ch. 5)</blockquote>\n\nOther forms of Catch-22 are invoked throughout the novel to justify various bureaucratic actions. At one point, victims of harassment by military police quote the MPs' explanation of one of Catch-22's provisions: \"Catch-22 states that agents enforcing Catch-22 need not prove that Catch-22 actually contains whatever provision the accused violator is accused of violating.\" Another character explains: \"Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.\"\n\nYossarian comes to realize that Catch-22 does not actually exist, but because the powers that be claim it does, and the world believes it does, it nevertheless has potent effects. Indeed, because it does not exist, there is no way it can be repealed, undone, overthrown, or denounced. The combination of force with specious and spurious legalistic justification is one of the book's primary motifs.\n\nThe motif of bureaucratic absurdity is further explored in 1994's [[Closing Time (novel)|''Closing Time'']], Heller's sequel to ''Catch-22''. This darker, slower-paced, apocalyptic novel explores the pre- and post-war lives of some of the major characters in ''Catch-22'', with particular emphasis on the relationship between Yossarian and tail gunner Sammy Singer.\n\n== Literary allusions ==\n''Catch-22'' contains allusions to many works of literature. [[Howard Jacobson]], in his 2004 introduction to the Vintage Classics publication, wrote that the novel was \"positioned teasingly ... between literature and literature's opposites&nbsp;\u2013 between [[Shakespeare]] and [[Rabelais]] and [[Dickens]] and [[Dostoevsky]] and [[Gogol]] and [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]] and the [[Absurdism|Absurdists]] and of course [[Kafka]] on the one hand, and on the other [[vaudeville]] and [[slapstick]] and [[The Phil Silvers Show|Bilko]] and [[Abbott and Costello]] and [[Tom and Jerry]] and [[the Goons]] (if Heller had ever heard of the Goons).\"<ref>[[Random House]] {{ISBN|978-0-09-947046-5}} [http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/vintage/classics/home.htm Vintage Classics]</ref>\nOne critic argues that it is Kafka's influence that can be seen most strongly in the novel:  \"Like Kafka's heroes, Yossarian is riddled with anxiety and caught in an inexorable nightmare \u2013 in his case created by Colonel Cathcart and the inevitability of his raising the number of missions he has to fly.\"<ref>[http://www.humanities-ebooks.co.uk/book/Reading_Catch-22 McDonald, Paul. ''Reading Catch-22.'' Humanities E-Books]</ref>\n\n== Historical context ==\n\nThe idea for ''Catch-22'' was based on Joseph Heller's personal experience in World War II. The feelings that Yossarian and the other bomber pilots felt were taken directly from problems he suffered while on duty. Heller flew 60 bombing missions from May to October in 1944. Heller was able to make it out of the war, but it took until 1953 before he could start writing about it. For this reason, the book contains references to post World War II phenomena like IBM computers and [[loyalty oath]]s. The war experience turned Heller into a \"tortured, funny, deeply peculiar human being\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Bailey|first=Blake|title=The Enigma of Joseph Heller|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/books/review/the-enigma-of-joseph-heller.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=bookreviews|accessdate=May 7, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter publication in 1961, ''Catch-22'' became very popular among teenagers at the time. ''Catch-22'' seemed to embody the feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of ''Catch-22''. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States. On October 26, 1986, professor and author [[John W. Aldridge]] wrote a piece in ''[[The New York Times]]'' celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publishing of \"Catch-22\". He commented that Heller's book presaged the chaos in the world that was to come:\n\n<blockquote>The comic fable that ends in horror has become more and more clearly a reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities of the world in which we live and hope to survive.<ref>{{cite news|last=Aldridge|first=John W.|title=The Loony Horror of it all - ''Catch-22'' Turns 25|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/15/home/heller-loony.html|accessdate=March 1, 2018|newspaper=Sunday New York Times|date=October 26, 1986}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough ''Catch-22'' is considered by many to be an [[anti-war novel]], Heller stated in a talk he gave at the [[New York Public Library]] on August 31, 1998 that he and the other men he knew in World War II considered the war to be \"noble\" and \"nobody really objected to fighting it\". The anti-war reputation of the novel was fueled instead by the pacifist, anti-war ethos among young Americans surrounding the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n== Title ==\n\nThe title is a reference to a fictional bureaucratic stipulation which embodies forms of illogical and immoral reasoning.<ref name=\":0\" /> The opening chapter of the novel was originally published in ''[[New World Writing]]'' as ''Catch-18'' in 1955, but Heller's agent, Candida Donadio, requested that he change the title of the novel, so it would not be confused with another recently published World War II novel, [[Leon Uris]]'s ''[[Mila 18]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> The number [[18 (number)|18]] has special meaning in Judaism (it means ''Alive'' in [[Gematria]]; see [[Chai (symbol)|Chai]]) and was relevant to early drafts of the novel which had a somewhat greater Jewish emphasis.<ref name=\"title\">N James. \"The Early Composition History of Catch-22\".

Eventually, the title came to be ''Catch-22'', which, like 11, has a duplicated digit, with the 2 also referring to a number of ''[[d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]]''-like events common in the novel.<ref name=\"title\" />\n\n== Publication and movie rights ==\n''Catch-22'' was sold to [[Simon & Schuster]], where it had been championed by editor [[Robert Gottlieb]], who, along with [[Nina Bourne]], would edit and oversee the marketing of the book.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Eller|first=Jonathan R.|date=October 1992|title=Catching a Market: The Publishing History of Catch-22|journal=Prospects|volume=17|pages=475\u2013525|doi=10.1017/S0361233300004804|pmid=}}</ref> Gottlieb was a strong advocate for the book along with [[Peter Schwed]] and [[Justin Kaplan]].

It received good notices and was nominated for the [[National Book Award]] in March 1962, though [[Walker Percy]]'s ''[[The Moviegoer]]'' won. ''Catch-22'' went through four printings in hardcover, but sold well on only the East Coast.

The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the [[principle of locality|disparity between classical and quantum physics]].\n\n[[Measurement#Quantum mechanics|Measurements]] of [[physical properties]] such as [[position (vector)|position]], [[momentum]], [[spin (physics)|spin]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] performed on entangled particles are found to be perfectly [[correlated]]. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, will be found to be counterclockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly [[paradox]]ical effects: any measurement of a property of a particle results in an irreversible [[wave function collapse]] of that particle and will change the original quantum state. In the case of entangled particles, such a measurement will affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky]], and [[Nathan Rosen]],<ref name=\"Einstein1935\">\n{{cite journal|author=Einstein A, Podolsky B, Rosen N|last2=Podolsky|last3=Rosen|year=1935|title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?|journal=Phys.

To avoid such action at a distance they have to attribute, to the space-time regions in question, real properties in advance of observation, correlated properties, which predetermine the outcomes of these particular observations. Since these real properties, fixed in advance of observation, are not contained in quantum formalism, that formalism for EPR is incomplete. It may be correct, as far as it goes, but the usual quantum formalism cannot be the whole story.\" And again on p. 144 Bell says: \"Einstein had no difficulty accepting that affairs in different places could be correlated.

They wrote: \"We are thus forced to conclude that the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete.\"<ref name=\"Einstein1935\"/>\n\nHowever, the three scientists did not coin the word ''entanglement'', nor did they generalize the special properties of the state they considered. Following the EPR paper, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] wrote a letter to Einstein in [[German language|German]] in which he used the word ''Verschr\u00e4nkung'' (translated by himself as ''entanglement'') \"to describe the correlations between two particles that interact and then separate, as in the EPR experiment.\"<ref name=MK>Kumar, M., ''Quantum'', Icon Books, 2009, p. 313.</ref>\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger shortly thereafter published a seminal paper defining and discussing the notion of \"entanglement.\" In the paper, he recognized the importance of the concept, and stated:<ref name=\"Schr\u00f6dinger1935\"/> \"I would not call [entanglement] ''one'' but rather ''the'' characteristic trait of [[quantum mechanics]], the one that enforces its entire departure from [[Classical mechanics|classical]] lines of thought.\"\n\nLike Einstein, Schr\u00f6dinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement, because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of information implicit in the [[theory of relativity]].<ref>Alisa Bokulich, Gregg Jaeger, ''Philosophy of Quantum Information and Entanglement'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, xv.</ref> Einstein later famously derided entanglement as \"''spukhafte Fernwirkung''\"<ref name=\"spukhafte\">Letter from Einstein to Max Born, 3 March 1947; ''The Born-Einstein Letters; Correspondence between Albert Einstein and Max and Hedwig Born from 1916 to 1955'', Walker, New York, 1971.

In entanglement, one constituent cannot be fully described without considering the other(s). The state of a composite system is always expressible as a sum, or [[quantum superposition|superposition]], of products of states of local constituents; it is entangled if this sum necessarily has more than one term.\n\nQuantum [[physical system|systems]] can become entangled through various types of interactions. For some ways in which entanglement may be achieved for experimental purposes, see the section below on [[#Methods of creating entanglement|methods]]. Entanglement is broken when the entangled particles [[quantum decoherence|decohere]] through interaction with the environment; for example, when a measurement is made.<ref name=\"Peres1993\">Asher Peres, ''[[Quantum Theory, Concepts and Methods]]'', Kluwer, 1993; {{ISBN|0-7923-2549-4}} p. 115.</ref>\n\nAs an example of entanglement: a [[subatomic particle]] [[Particle decay|decays]] into an entangled pair of other particles. The decay events obey the various [[conservation laws]], and as a result, the measurement outcomes of one daughter particle must be highly correlated with the measurement outcomes of the other daughter particle (so that the total momenta, angular momenta, energy, and so forth remains roughly the same before and after this process). For instance, a [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-zero particle could decay into a pair of spin-\u00bd particles. Since the total spin before and after this decay must be zero (conservation of angular momentum), whenever the first particle is measured to be [[Spin (physics)#Direction|spin up]] on some axis, the other, when measured on the same axis, is always found to be [[Spin (physics)#Direction|spin down]]. (This is called the spin anti-correlated case; and if the prior probabilities for measuring each spin are equal, the pair is said to be in the [[singlet state]].)\n\nThe special property of entanglement can be better observed if we separate the said two particles. Let's put one of them in the White House in Washington and the other in Buckingham Palace (think about this as a thought experiment, not an actual one). Now, if we measure a particular characteristic of one of these particles (say, for example, spin), get a result, and then measure the other particle using the same criterion (spin along the same axis), we find that the result of the measurement of the second particle will match (in a complementary sense) the result of the measurement of the first particle, in that they will be opposite in their values.\n\nThe above result may or may not be perceived as surprising. A classical system would display the same property, and a [[hidden variable theory]] (see below) would certainly be required to do so, based on conservation of angular momentum in classical and quantum mechanics alike. The difference is that a classical system has definite values for all the observables all along, while the quantum system does not. In a sense to be discussed below, the quantum system considered here seems to acquire a probability distribution for the outcome of a measurement of the spin along any axis of the other particle upon measurement of the first particle. This probability distribution is in general different from what it would be without measurement of the first particle. This may certainly be perceived as surprising in the case of spatially separated entangled particles.\n\n===Paradox===\nThe paradox is that a measurement made on either of the particles apparently collapses the state of the entire entangled system\u2014and does so instantaneously, before any information about the measurement result could have been communicated to the other particle (assuming that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]) and hence assured the \"proper\" outcome of the measurement of the other part of the entangled pair. In the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], the result of a spin measurement on one of the particles is a collapse into a state in which each particle has a definite spin (either up or down) along the axis of measurement. The outcome is taken to be random, with each possibility having a probability of 50%. However, if both spins are measured along the same axis, they are found to be anti-correlated. This means that the random outcome of the measurement made on one particle seems to have been transmitted to the other, so that it can make the \"right choice\" when it too is measured.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rupert W.|first1=Anderson|title=The Cosmic Compendium: Interstellar Travel|date=28 March 2015|publisher=The Cosmic Compendium|isbn=9781329022027|page=100|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JxauCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=The+outcome+is+taken+to+be+random,+with+each+possibility+having+a+probability+of+50%25.+However,+if+both+spins+are+measured+along+the+same+axis,+they+are+found+to+be+anti-correlated.+This+means+that+the+random+outcome+of+the+measurement+made+on+one+particle+seems+to+have+been+transmitted+to+the+other,+so+that+it+can+make+the+%22right+choice%22+when+it+too+is+measured#v=onepage&q=The%20outcome%20is%20taken%20to%20be%20random%2C%20with%20each%20possibility%20having%20a%20probability%20of%2050%25.%20However%2C%20if%20both%20spins%20are%20measured%20along%20the%20same%20axis%2C%20they%20are%20found%20to%20be%20anti-correlated.%20This%20means%20that%20the%20random%20outcome%20of%20the%20measurement%20made%20on%20one%20particle%20seems%20to%20have%20been%20transmitted%20to%20the%20other%2C%20so%20that%20it%20can%20make%20the%20%22right%20choice%22%20when%20it%20too%20is%20measured&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe distance and timing of the measurements can be chosen so as to make the interval between the two measurements [[spacelike]], hence, any causal effect connecting the events would have to travel faster than light. According to the principles of [[special relativity]], it is not possible for any information to travel between two such measuring events. It is not even possible to say which of the measurements came first. For two spacelike separated events {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} there are [[inertial frame]]s in which {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} is first and others in which {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} is first. Therefore, the correlation between the two measurements cannot be explained as one measurement determining the other: different observers would disagree about the role of cause and effect.\n\n(In fact similar paradoxes can arise even without entanglement: the position of a single particle is spread out over space, and two widely separated detectors attempting to detect the particle in two different places must instantaneously attain appropriate correlation, so that they do not both detect the particle.)\n\n=== Hidden variables theory ===\nA possible resolution to the paradox is to assume that quantum theory is incomplete, and the result of measurements depends on predetermined \"hidden variables\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cosmic-test-bolsters-einsteins-ldquo-spooky-action-at-a-distance-rdquo/?WT.mc_id=SA_FB_PHYS_NEWS|title=Cosmic Test Bolsters Einstein's \"Spooky Action at a Distance\"|last=magazine|first=Elizabeth Gibney, Nature|newspaper=Scientific American|language=en|access-date=2017-02-04}}</ref>  The state of the particles being measured contains some [[hidden-variable theory|hidden variables]], whose values effectively determine, right from the moment of separation, what the outcomes of the spin measurements are going to be. This would mean that each particle carries all the required information with it, and nothing needs to be transmitted from one particle to the other at the time of measurement. Einstein and others (see the previous section) originally believed  this was the only way out of the paradox, and the accepted quantum mechanical description (with a random measurement outcome) must be incomplete.\n\n=== Violations of Bell's inequality ===\nThe hidden variables theory fails, however, when measurements of the spin of entangled particles along different axes are considered. If a large number of pairs of such measurements are made (on a large number of pairs of entangled particles), then statistically, if the [[local realism|local realist]] or hidden variables view were correct, the results would always satisfy [[Bell's inequality]]. A [[Bell test experiments|number of experiments]] have shown in practice that Bell's inequality is not satisfied. However, prior to 2015, all of these had loophole problems that were considered the most important by the community of physicists.<ref>{{citation |author1=I. Gerhardt |author2=Q. Liu |author3=A.

For example, say that a high energy photon decays into an electron / positron pair, and the position of the electron and the momentum of the positron are then measured. If we don't allow entanglement in the physical description of the pair, the position and momentum of each particle can still be deduced by reference to the conservation of momentum, violating the Uncertainty principle. Alternatively, if we require the uncertainty principle to hold true, and still disallow entanglement in the physical description of the pair, the uncertainty principle would allow violations in the law of conservation of momentum, because strong correlation in both position and momentum would be impossible (i.e., one would not be able to effectively deduce the position and momentum of the electron because they could not be highly correlated with both the position and momentum of the positron).-->\n\n=== Other types of experiments ===\nIn experiments in 2012 and 2013, polarization correlation was created between photons that never coexisted in time.<ref name=\"Xiao-song2012\">{{cite journal |author=Xiao-song Ma, Stefan Zotter, Johannes Kofler, Rupert Ursin, Thomas Jennewein, \u010caslav Brukner & Anton Zeilinger |title=Experimental delayed-choice entanglement swapping |journal=Nature Physics |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=480\u2013485 |date=26 April 2012 |doi=10.1038/nphys2294|arxiv = 1203.4834 |bibcode = 2012NatPh...8..480M |last2=Zotter |last3=Kofler |last4=Ursin |last5=Jennewein |last6=Brukner |last7=Zeilinger }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Megidish | first1 = E. | last2 = Halevy | first2 = A. | last3 = Shacham | first3 = T. | last4 = Dvir | first4 = T. | last5 = Dovrat | first5 = L. | last6 = Eisenberg | first6 = H.

However, it remains an open question whether all entangled states become non-local given sufficiently many copies.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Disproving the Peres conjecture: Bell nonlocality from bipartite bound entanglement |authors=Tamas V\u00e9rtesi, Nicolas Brunner|year=2014 |journal=Nature Communications |volume=5 |issue=5297|page=5297 |doi=10.1038/ncomms6297 |pmid=25370352|arxiv=1405.4502 }}</ref>\n\nIn short, entanglement of a state shared by two parties is necessary but not sufficient for that state to be non-local. It is important to recognize that entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being a prerequisite to non-locality as well as to [[quantum teleportation]] and to [[superdense coding]], whereas non-locality is defined according to experimental statistics and is much more involved with the [[Quantum foundations|foundations]] and [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]].<ref>In the literature \"non-locality\" is sometimes used to characterize concepts that differ from the non-existence of a local hidden variable model, e.g., whether states can be distinguished by local measurements and which can occur also for non-entangled states (see, e.g., {{cite journal |authors=Charles H.

The Hilbert space of the composite system is the [[tensor product]]\n\n: <math> H_A \\otimes H_B.</math>\n\nIf the first system is in state <math>\\scriptstyle| \\psi \\rangle_A</math> and the second in state <math>\\scriptstyle| \\phi \\rangle_B</math>, the state of the composite system is\n\n: <math>|\\psi\\rangle_A \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle_B.</math>\n\nStates of the composite system that can be represented in this form are called [[separable state]]s, or [[product state]]s.\n\nNot all states are separable states (and thus product states). Fix a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] <math>\\scriptstyle \\{|i \\rangle_A\\}</math> for {{mvar|H<sub>A</sub>}} and a basis <math>\\scriptstyle \\{|j \\rangle_B\\}</math> for {{mvar|H<sub>B</sub>}}. The most general state in {{math|''H<sub>A</sub>'' \u2297 ''H<sub>B</sub>''}} is of the form\n\n: <math>|\\psi\\rangle_{AB} = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} |i\\rangle_A \\otimes |j\\rangle_B</math>.\n\nThis state is separable if there exist vectors <math>\\scriptstyle [c^A_i], [c^B_j]</math> so that <math>\\scriptstyle c_{ij}= c^A_ic^B_j,</math> yielding <math>\\scriptstyle |\\psi\\rangle_A = \\sum_{i} c^A_{i} |i\\rangle_A</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle |\\phi\\rangle_B = \\sum_{j} c^B_{j} |j\\rangle_B.</math> It is inseparable if for any vectors <math>\\scriptstyle [c^A_i],[c^B_j]</math> at least for one pair of coordinates <math>\\scriptstyle c^A_i,c^B_j</math> we have <math>\\scriptstyle c_{ij} \\neq c^A_ic^B_j.</math> If a state is inseparable, it is called an 'entangled state'.\n\nFor example, given two basis vectors <math>\\scriptstyle \\{|0\\rangle_A, |1\\rangle_A\\}</math> of {{mvar|H<sub>A</sub>}} and two basis vectors <math>\\scriptstyle \\{|0\\rangle_B, |1\\rangle_B\\}</math> of {{mvar|H<sub>B</sub>}}, the following is an entangled state:\n\n: <math>\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left ( |0\\rangle_A \\otimes |1\\rangle_B - |1\\rangle_A \\otimes |0\\rangle_B \\right ).</math>\n\nIf the composite system is in this state, it is impossible to attribute to either system {{mvar|A}} or system {{mvar|B}} a definite [[pure state]]. Another way to say this is that while the [[von Neumann entropy]] of the whole state is zero (as it is for any pure state), the entropy of the subsystems is greater than zero. In this sense, the systems are \"entangled\". This has specific empirical ramifications for interferometry.<ref name=\"JaegerEtAl95\">{{cite journal |author=Jaeger G, Shimony A, Vaidman L |title=Two Interferometric Complementarities |journal=Phys.

If the latter occurs, (Alice measures 1) then Bob's measurement will return 0 with certainty. Thus, system {{mvar|B}} has been altered by Alice performing a local measurement on system {{mvar|A}}. This remains true even if the systems {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are spatially separated. This is the foundation of the [[EPR paradox]].\n\nThe outcome of Alice's measurement is random. Alice cannot decide which state to collapse the composite system into, and therefore cannot transmit information to Bob by acting on her system. Causality is thus preserved, in this particular scheme. For the general argument, see [[no-communication theorem]].\n\n=== Ensembles ===\nAs mentioned above, a state of a quantum system is given by a unit vector in a Hilbert space. More generally, if one has less information about the system, then one calls it an 'ensemble' and describes it by a [[density matrix]], which is a [[positive-semidefinite matrix]], or a [[trace class]] when the state space is infinite-dimensional, and has trace 1. Again, by the [[spectral theorem]], such a matrix takes the general form:\n\n: <math>\\rho = \\sum_i w_i |\\alpha_i\\rangle \\langle\\alpha_i|,</math>\n\nwhere the ''w''<sub>i</sub> are positive-valued probabilities (they sum up to 1), the vectors {{mvar| \u03b1<sub>i</sub>}} are unit vectors, and in the infinite-dimensional case, we would take the closure of such states in the trace norm. We can interpret {{mvar|\u03c1}} as representing an ensemble where {{mvar|w<sub>i</sub>}} is the proportion of the ensemble whose states are <math>|\\alpha_i\\rangle</math>. When a mixed state has rank 1, it therefore describes a 'pure ensemble'. When there is less than total information about the state of a quantum system we need [[#Reduced density matrices|density matrices]] to represent the state.\n\nExperimentally, a mixed ensemble might be realized as follows. Consider a \"black box\" apparatus that spits [[electron]]s towards an observer. The electrons' Hilbert spaces are [[identical particles|identical]]. The apparatus might produce electrons that are all in the same state; in this case, the electrons received by the observer are then a pure ensemble. However, the apparatus could produce electrons in different states. For example, it could produce two populations of electrons: one with state <math>|\\mathbf{z}+\\rangle</math> with [[spin (physics)|spins]] aligned in the positive {{math|'''z'''}} direction, and the other with state <math>|\\mathbf{y}-\\rangle</math> with spins aligned in the negative {{math|'''y'''}} direction. Generally, this is a mixed ensemble, as there can be any number of populations, each corresponding to a different state.\n\nFollowing the definition above, for a bipartite composite system, mixed states are just density matrices on {{math|''H<sub>A</sub>'' \u2297 ''H<sub>B</sub>''}}. That is, it has the general form\n\n: <math>\\rho =\\sum_{i} w_i\\left[\\sum_{j} \\bar{c}_{ij} (|\\alpha_{ij}\\rangle\\otimes|\\beta_{ij}\\rangle)\\right]\\left[\\sum_k c_{ik} (\\langle\\alpha_{ik}|\\otimes\\langle\\beta_{ik}|)\\right]\n</math>\n\nwhere the ''w''<sub>i</sub> are positively valued probabilities, <math>\\sum_j |c_{ij}|^2=1</math>, and the vectors are unit vectors. This is self-adjoint and positive and has trace 1.\n\nExtending the definition of separability from the pure case, we say that a mixed state is separable if it can be written as<ref name=Laloe>{{citation|last=Laloe|first=Franck|year=2001|title=Do We Really Understand Quantum Mechanics|journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=69 |issue=6|pages=655\u2013701 |arxiv=quant-ph/0209123 |bibcode=2001AmJPh..69..655L |doi=10.1119/1.1356698}}</ref>{{rp|131\u2013132}}\n\n: <math>\\rho = \\sum_i w_i \\rho_i^A \\otimes \\rho_i^B, </math>\n\nwhere the {{mvar|w<sub>i</sub>}} are positively valued probabilities and the <math>\\rho_i^A</math>'s and <math>\\rho_i^B</math>'s are themselves mixed states (density operators) on the subsystems {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} respectively. In other words, a state is separable if it is a probability distribution over uncorrelated states, or product states. By writing the density matrices as sums of pure ensembles and expanding, we may assume without loss of generality that <math>\\rho_i^A</math> and <math>\\rho_i^B</math> are themselves pure ensembles. A state is then said to be entangled if it is not separable.\n\nIn general, finding out whether or not a mixed state is entangled is considered difficult.

The setting in which this perspective is most evident is that of \"distant labs\", i.e., two quantum systems labeled \"A\" and \"B\" on each of which arbitrary [[quantum operation]]s can be performed, but which do not interact with each other quantum mechanically. The only interaction allowed is the exchange of classical information, which combined with the most general local quantum operations gives rise to the class of operations called [[LOCC]] (local operations and classical communication). These operations do not allow the production of entangled states between the systems A and B. But if A and B are provided with a supply of entangled states, then these, together with LOCC operations can enable a larger class of transformations. For example, an interaction between a qubit of A and a qubit of B can be realized by first teleporting A's qubit to B, then letting it interact with B's qubit (which is now a LOCC operation, since both qubits are in B's lab) and then teleporting the qubit back to A. Two maximally entangled states of two qubits are used up in this process. Thus entangled states are a resource that enables the realization of quantum interactions (or of quantum channels) in a setting where only LOCC are available, but they are consumed in the process. There are other applications where entanglement can be seen as a resource, e.g., private communication or distinguishing quantum states.<ref name=\"horodecki2007\" />\n\n=== Classification of entanglement ===\nNot all quantum states are equally valuable as a resource. To quantify this value, different [[Quantum entanglement#Entanglement measures|entanglement measures]] (see below) can be used, that assign a numerical value to each quantum state. However, it is often interesting to settle for a coarser way to compare quantum states. This gives rise to different classification schemes. Most entanglement classes are defined based on whether states can be converted to other states using LOCC or a subclass of these operations. The smaller the set of allowed operations, the finer the classification. Important examples are:\n* If two states can be transformed into each other by a local unitary operation, they are said to be in the same ''LU class''. This is the finest of the usually considered classes. Two states in the same LU class have the same value for entanglement measures and the same value as a resource in the distant-labs setting. There is an infinite number of different LU classes (even in the simplest case of two qubits in a pure state).<ref name=\"GRB1998\">>{{cite journal |author1=Grassl, M. |author2=R\u00f6tteler, M. |author3=Beth, T. |title=Computing local invariants of quantum-bit systems |journal=Phys.

Therefore, a bipartite pure state {{math|''\u03c1'' \u2208 ''H''<sub>A</sub> \u2297 ''H''<sub>B</sub>}} is said to be a '''maximally entangled state''' if the reduced state{{clarify|reason=To which system, A or B, or perhaps both?|date=May 2015}} of {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the diagonal matrix\n\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{n}& & \\\\ & \\ddots & \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{n}\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nFor mixed states, the reduced von Neumann entropy is not the only reasonable entanglement measure.\n\nAs an aside, the information-theoretic definition is closely related to [[entropy (statistical views)|entropy]] in the sense of statistical mechanics{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} (comparing the two definitions in the present context, it is customary to set the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1}}). For example, by properties of the [[Borel functional calculus]], we see that for any [[unitary operator]] {{mvar|U}},\n\n: <math>S(\\rho) = S \\left (U \\rho U^* \\right).</math>\n\nIndeed, without this property, the von Neumann entropy would not be well-defined.\n\nIn particular, {{mvar|U}} could be the time evolution operator of the system, i.e.,\n\n: <math>U(t) = \\exp \\left(\\frac{-i H t }{\\hbar}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|H}} is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the system. Here the entropy is unchanged.\n\nThe reversibility of a process is associated with the resulting entropy change, i.e., a process is reversible if, and only if, it leaves the entropy of the system invariant.

The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the [[principle of locality|disparity between classical and quantum physics]].\n\n[[Measurement#Quantum mechanics|Measurements]] of [[physical properties]] such as [[position (vector)|position]], [[momentum]], [[spin (physics)|spin]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] performed on entangled particles are found to be perfectly [[correlated]]. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, will be found to be counterclockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly [[paradox]]ical effects: any measurement of a property of a particle results in an irreversible [[wave function collapse]] of that particle and will change the original quantum state. In the case of entangled particles, such a measurement will affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky]], and [[Nathan Rosen]],<ref name=\"Einstein1935\">\n{{cite journal|author=Einstein A, Podolsky B, Rosen N|last2=Podolsky|last3=Rosen|year=1935|title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?|journal=Phys.

To avoid such action at a distance they have to attribute, to the space-time regions in question, real properties in advance of observation, correlated properties, which predetermine the outcomes of these particular observations. Since these real properties, fixed in advance of observation, are not contained in quantum formalism, that formalism for EPR is incomplete. It may be correct, as far as it goes, but the usual quantum formalism cannot be the whole story.\" And again on p. 144 Bell says: \"Einstein had no difficulty accepting that affairs in different places could be correlated. What he could not accept was that an intervention at one place could influence, immediately, affairs at the other.\" Downloaded 5 July 2011 from {{cite  book |year=1987 |accessdate=2014-06-14 |title=Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics |first=J.

Following the EPR paper, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] wrote a letter to Einstein in [[German language|German]] in which he used the word ''Verschr\u00e4nkung'' (translated by himself as ''entanglement'') \"to describe the correlations between two particles that interact and then separate, as in the EPR experiment.\"<ref name=MK>Kumar, M., ''Quantum'', Icon Books, 2009, p. 313.</ref>\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger shortly thereafter published a seminal paper defining and discussing the notion of \"entanglement.\" In the paper, he recognized the importance of the concept, and stated:<ref name=\"Schr\u00f6dinger1935\"/> \"I would not call [entanglement] ''one'' but rather ''the'' characteristic trait of [[quantum mechanics]], the one that enforces its entire departure from [[Classical mechanics|classical]] lines of thought.\"\n\nLike Einstein, Schr\u00f6dinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement, because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of information implicit in the [[theory of relativity]].<ref>Alisa Bokulich, Gregg Jaeger, ''Philosophy of Quantum Information and Entanglement'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, xv.</ref> Einstein later famously derided entanglement as \"''spukhafte Fernwirkung''\"<ref name=\"spukhafte\">Letter from Einstein to Max Born, 3 March 1947; ''The Born-Einstein Letters; Correspondence between Albert Einstein and Max and Hedwig Born from 1916 to 1955'', Walker, New York, 1971.

Despite the interest, the weak point in EPR's argument was not discovered until 1964, when [[John Stewart Bell]] proved that one of their key assumptions, the [[principle of locality]], as applied to the kind of hidden variables interpretation hoped for by EPR, was mathematically inconsistent with the predictions of quantum theory.\n\nSpecifically, Bell demonstrated an upper limit, seen in [[Bell's inequality]], regarding the strength of correlations that can be produced in any theory obeying [[local realism]], and showed that quantum theory predicts violations of this limit for certain entangled systems.<ref>{{cite journal |author = J.

In entanglement, one constituent cannot be fully described without considering the other(s). The state of a composite system is always expressible as a sum, or [[quantum superposition|superposition]], of products of states of local constituents; it is entangled if this sum necessarily has more than one term.\n\nQuantum [[physical system|systems]] can become entangled through various types of interactions. For some ways in which entanglement may be achieved for experimental purposes, see the section below on [[#Methods of creating entanglement|methods]]. Entanglement is broken when the entangled particles [[quantum decoherence|decohere]] through interaction with the environment; for example, when a measurement is made.<ref name=\"Peres1993\">Asher Peres, ''[[Quantum Theory, Concepts and Methods]]'', Kluwer, 1993; {{ISBN|0-7923-2549-4}} p. 115.</ref>\n\nAs an example of entanglement: a [[subatomic particle]] [[Particle decay|decays]] into an entangled pair of other particles. The decay events obey the various [[conservation laws]], and as a result, the measurement outcomes of one daughter particle must be highly correlated with the measurement outcomes of the other daughter particle (so that the total momenta, angular momenta, energy, and so forth remains roughly the same before and after this process). For instance, a [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-zero particle could decay into a pair of spin-\u00bd particles. Since the total spin before and after this decay must be zero (conservation of angular momentum), whenever the first particle is measured to be [[Spin (physics)#Direction|spin up]] on some axis, the other, when measured on the same axis, is always found to be [[Spin (physics)#Direction|spin down]]. (This is called the spin anti-correlated case; and if the prior probabilities for measuring each spin are equal, the pair is said to be in the [[singlet state]].)\n\nThe special property of entanglement can be better observed if we separate the said two particles. Let's put one of them in the White House in Washington and the other in Buckingham Palace (think about this as a thought experiment, not an actual one). Now, if we measure a particular characteristic of one of these particles (say, for example, spin), get a result, and then measure the other particle using the same criterion (spin along the same axis), we find that the result of the measurement of the second particle will match (in a complementary sense) the result of the measurement of the first particle, in that they will be opposite in their values.\n\nThe above result may or may not be perceived as surprising. A classical system would display the same property, and a [[hidden variable theory]] (see below) would certainly be required to do so, based on conservation of angular momentum in classical and quantum mechanics alike. The difference is that a classical system has definite values for all the observables all along, while the quantum system does not. In a sense to be discussed below, the quantum system considered here seems to acquire a probability distribution for the outcome of a measurement of the spin along any axis of the other particle upon measurement of the first particle. This probability distribution is in general different from what it would be without measurement of the first particle. This may certainly be perceived as surprising in the case of spatially separated entangled particles.\n\n===Paradox===\nThe paradox is that a measurement made on either of the particles apparently collapses the state of the entire entangled system\u2014and does so instantaneously, before any information about the measurement result could have been communicated to the other particle (assuming that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]) and hence assured the \"proper\" outcome of the measurement of the other part of the entangled pair. In the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], the result of a spin measurement on one of the particles is a collapse into a state in which each particle has a definite spin (either up or down) along the axis of measurement. The outcome is taken to be random, with each possibility having a probability of 50%. However, if both spins are measured along the same axis, they are found to be anti-correlated. This means that the random outcome of the measurement made on one particle seems to have been transmitted to the other, so that it can make the \"right choice\" when it too is measured.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rupert W.|first1=Anderson|title=The Cosmic Compendium: Interstellar Travel|date=28 March 2015|publisher=The Cosmic Compendium|isbn=9781329022027|page=100|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JxauCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=The+outcome+is+taken+to+be+random,+with+each+possibility+having+a+probability+of+50%25.+However,+if+both+spins+are+measured+along+the+same+axis,+they+are+found+to+be+anti-correlated.+This+means+that+the+random+outcome+of+the+measurement+made+on+one+particle+seems+to+have+been+transmitted+to+the+other,+so+that+it+can+make+the+%22right+choice%22+when+it+too+is+measured#v=onepage&q=The%20outcome%20is%20taken%20to%20be%20random%2C%20with%20each%20possibility%20having%20a%20probability%20of%2050%25.%20However%2C%20if%20both%20spins%20are%20measured%20along%20the%20same%20axis%2C%20they%20are%20found%20to%20be%20anti-correlated.%20This%20means%20that%20the%20random%20outcome%20of%20the%20measurement%20made%20on%20one%20particle%20seems%20to%20have%20been%20transmitted%20to%20the%20other%2C%20so%20that%20it%20can%20make%20the%20%22right%20choice%22%20when%20it%20too%20is%20measured&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe distance and timing of the measurements can be chosen so as to make the interval between the two measurements [[spacelike]], hence, any causal effect connecting the events would have to travel faster than light. According to the principles of [[special relativity]], it is not possible for any information to travel between two such measuring events. It is not even possible to say which of the measurements came first. For two spacelike separated events {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} there are [[inertial frame]]s in which {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} is first and others in which {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} is first. Therefore, the correlation between the two measurements cannot be explained as one measurement determining the other: different observers would disagree about the role of cause and effect.\n\n(In fact similar paradoxes can arise even without entanglement: the position of a single particle is spread out over space, and two widely separated detectors attempting to detect the particle in two different places must instantaneously attain appropriate correlation, so that they do not both detect the particle.)\n\n=== Hidden variables theory ===\nA possible resolution to the paradox is to assume that quantum theory is incomplete, and the result of measurements depends on predetermined \"hidden variables\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cosmic-test-bolsters-einsteins-ldquo-spooky-action-at-a-distance-rdquo/?WT.mc_id=SA_FB_PHYS_NEWS|title=Cosmic Test Bolsters Einstein's \"Spooky Action at a Distance\"|last=magazine|first=Elizabeth Gibney, Nature|newspaper=Scientific American|language=en|access-date=2017-02-04}}</ref>  The state of the particles being measured contains some [[hidden-variable theory|hidden variables]], whose values effectively determine, right from the moment of separation, what the outcomes of the spin measurements are going to be. This would mean that each particle carries all the required information with it, and nothing needs to be transmitted from one particle to the other at the time of measurement. Einstein and others (see the previous section) originally believed  this was the only way out of the paradox, and the accepted quantum mechanical description (with a random measurement outcome) must be incomplete.\n\n=== Violations of Bell's inequality ===\nThe hidden variables theory fails, however, when measurements of the spin of entangled particles along different axes are considered. If a large number of pairs of such measurements are made (on a large number of pairs of entangled particles), then statistically, if the [[local realism|local realist]] or hidden variables view were correct, the results would always satisfy [[Bell's inequality]]. A [[Bell test experiments|number of experiments]] have shown in practice that Bell's inequality is not satisfied. However, prior to 2015, all of these had loophole problems that were considered the most important by the community of physicists.<ref>{{citation |author1=I. Gerhardt |author2=Q. Liu |author3=A.

For example, say that a high energy photon decays into an electron / positron pair, and the position of the electron and the momentum of the positron are then measured. If we don't allow entanglement in the physical description of the pair, the position and momentum of each particle can still be deduced by reference to the conservation of momentum, violating the Uncertainty principle. Alternatively, if we require the uncertainty principle to hold true, and still disallow entanglement in the physical description of the pair, the uncertainty principle would allow violations in the law of conservation of momentum, because strong correlation in both position and momentum would be impossible (i.e., one would not be able to effectively deduce the position and momentum of the electron because they could not be highly correlated with both the position and momentum of the positron).-->\n\n=== Other types of experiments ===\nIn experiments in 2012 and 2013, polarization correlation was created between photons that never coexisted in time.<ref name=\"Xiao-song2012\">{{cite journal |author=Xiao-song Ma, Stefan Zotter, Johannes Kofler, Rupert Ursin, Thomas Jennewein, \u010caslav Brukner & Anton Zeilinger |title=Experimental delayed-choice entanglement swapping |journal=Nature Physics |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=480\u2013485 |date=26 April 2012 |doi=10.1038/nphys2294|arxiv = 1203.4834 |bibcode = 2012NatPh...8..480M |last2=Zotter |last3=Kofler |last4=Ursin |last5=Jennewein |last6=Brukner |last7=Zeilinger }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Megidish | first1 = E. | last2 = Halevy | first2 = A. | last3 = Shacham | first3 = T. | last4 = Dvir | first4 = T. | last5 = Dovrat | first5 = L. | last6 = Eisenberg | first6 = H.

The Hilbert space of the composite system is the [[tensor product]]\n\n: <math> H_A \\otimes H_B.</math>\n\nIf the first system is in state <math>\\scriptstyle| \\psi \\rangle_A</math> and the second in state <math>\\scriptstyle| \\phi \\rangle_B</math>, the state of the composite system is\n\n: <math>|\\psi\\rangle_A \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle_B.</math>\n\nStates of the composite system that can be represented in this form are called [[separable state]]s, or [[product state]]s.\n\nNot all states are separable states (and thus product states). Fix a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] <math>\\scriptstyle \\{|i \\rangle_A\\}</math> for {{mvar|H<sub>A</sub>}} and a basis <math>\\scriptstyle \\{|j \\rangle_B\\}</math> for {{mvar|H<sub>B</sub>}}. The most general state in {{math|''H<sub>A</sub>'' \u2297 ''H<sub>B</sub>''}} is of the form\n\n: <math>|\\psi\\rangle_{AB} = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} |i\\rangle_A \\otimes |j\\rangle_B</math>.\n\nThis state is separable if there exist vectors <math>\\scriptstyle [c^A_i], [c^B_j]</math> so that <math>\\scriptstyle c_{ij}= c^A_ic^B_j,</math> yielding <math>\\scriptstyle |\\psi\\rangle_A = \\sum_{i} c^A_{i} |i\\rangle_A</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle |\\phi\\rangle_B = \\sum_{j} c^B_{j} |j\\rangle_B.</math> It is inseparable if for any vectors <math>\\scriptstyle [c^A_i],[c^B_j]</math> at least for one pair of coordinates <math>\\scriptstyle c^A_i,c^B_j</math> we have <math>\\scriptstyle c_{ij} \\neq c^A_ic^B_j.</math> If a state is inseparable, it is called an 'entangled state'.\n\nFor example, given two basis vectors <math>\\scriptstyle \\{|0\\rangle_A, |1\\rangle_A\\}</math> of {{mvar|H<sub>A</sub>}} and two basis vectors <math>\\scriptstyle \\{|0\\rangle_B, |1\\rangle_B\\}</math> of {{mvar|H<sub>B</sub>}}, the following is an entangled state:\n\n: <math>\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left ( |0\\rangle_A \\otimes |1\\rangle_B - |1\\rangle_A \\otimes |0\\rangle_B \\right ).</math>\n\nIf the composite system is in this state, it is impossible to attribute to either system {{mvar|A}} or system {{mvar|B}} a definite [[pure state]]. Another way to say this is that while the [[von Neumann entropy]] of the whole state is zero (as it is for any pure state), the entropy of the subsystems is greater than zero. In this sense, the systems are \"entangled\". This has specific empirical ramifications for interferometry.<ref name=\"JaegerEtAl95\">{{cite journal |author=Jaeger G, Shimony A, Vaidman L |title=Two Interferometric Complementarities |journal=Phys.

If the latter occurs, (Alice measures 1) then Bob's measurement will return 0 with certainty. Thus, system {{mvar|B}} has been altered by Alice performing a local measurement on system {{mvar|A}}. This remains true even if the systems {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are spatially separated. This is the foundation of the [[EPR paradox]].\n\nThe outcome of Alice's measurement is random. Alice cannot decide which state to collapse the composite system into, and therefore cannot transmit information to Bob by acting on her system. Causality is thus preserved, in this particular scheme. For the general argument, see [[no-communication theorem]].\n\n=== Ensembles ===\nAs mentioned above, a state of a quantum system is given by a unit vector in a Hilbert space. More generally, if one has less information about the system, then one calls it an 'ensemble' and describes it by a [[density matrix]], which is a [[positive-semidefinite matrix]], or a [[trace class]] when the state space is infinite-dimensional, and has trace 1. Again, by the [[spectral theorem]], such a matrix takes the general form:\n\n: <math>\\rho = \\sum_i w_i |\\alpha_i\\rangle \\langle\\alpha_i|,</math>\n\nwhere the ''w''<sub>i</sub> are positive-valued probabilities (they sum up to 1), the vectors {{mvar| \u03b1<sub>i</sub>}} are unit vectors, and in the infinite-dimensional case, we would take the closure of such states in the trace norm. We can interpret {{mvar|\u03c1}} as representing an ensemble where {{mvar|w<sub>i</sub>}} is the proportion of the ensemble whose states are <math>|\\alpha_i\\rangle</math>. When a mixed state has rank 1, it therefore describes a 'pure ensemble'. When there is less than total information about the state of a quantum system we need [[#Reduced density matrices|density matrices]] to represent the state.\n\nExperimentally, a mixed ensemble might be realized as follows. Consider a \"black box\" apparatus that spits [[electron]]s towards an observer. The electrons' Hilbert spaces are [[identical particles|identical]]. The apparatus might produce electrons that are all in the same state; in this case, the electrons received by the observer are then a pure ensemble. However, the apparatus could produce electrons in different states. For example, it could produce two populations of electrons: one with state <math>|\\mathbf{z}+\\rangle</math> with [[spin (physics)|spins]] aligned in the positive {{math|'''z'''}} direction, and the other with state <math>|\\mathbf{y}-\\rangle</math> with spins aligned in the negative {{math|'''y'''}} direction. Generally, this is a mixed ensemble, as there can be any number of populations, each corresponding to a different state.\n\nFollowing the definition above, for a bipartite composite system, mixed states are just density matrices on {{math|''H<sub>A</sub>'' \u2297 ''H<sub>B</sub>''}}. That is, it has the general form\n\n: <math>\\rho =\\sum_{i} w_i\\left[\\sum_{j} \\bar{c}_{ij} (|\\alpha_{ij}\\rangle\\otimes|\\beta_{ij}\\rangle)\\right]\\left[\\sum_k c_{ik} (\\langle\\alpha_{ik}|\\otimes\\langle\\beta_{ik}|)\\right]\n</math>\n\nwhere the ''w''<sub>i</sub> are positively valued probabilities, <math>\\sum_j |c_{ij}|^2=1</math>, and the vectors are unit vectors. This is self-adjoint and positive and has trace 1.\n\nExtending the definition of separability from the pure case, we say that a mixed state is separable if it can be written as<ref name=Laloe>{{citation|last=Laloe|first=Franck|year=2001|title=Do We Really Understand Quantum Mechanics|journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=69 |issue=6|pages=655\u2013701 |arxiv=quant-ph/0209123 |bibcode=2001AmJPh..69..655L |doi=10.1119/1.1356698}}</ref>{{rp|131\u2013132}}\n\n: <math>\\rho = \\sum_i w_i \\rho_i^A \\otimes \\rho_i^B, </math>\n\nwhere the {{mvar|w<sub>i</sub>}} are positively valued probabilities and the <math>\\rho_i^A</math>'s and <math>\\rho_i^B</math>'s are themselves mixed states (density operators) on the subsystems {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} respectively. In other words, a state is separable if it is a probability distribution over uncorrelated states, or product states. By writing the density matrices as sums of pure ensembles and expanding, we may assume without loss of generality that <math>\\rho_i^A</math> and <math>\\rho_i^B</math> are themselves pure ensembles. A state is then said to be entangled if it is not separable.\n\nIn general, finding out whether or not a mixed state is entangled is considered difficult.

The setting in which this perspective is most evident is that of \"distant labs\", i.e., two quantum systems labeled \"A\" and \"B\" on each of which arbitrary [[quantum operation]]s can be performed, but which do not interact with each other quantum mechanically. The only interaction allowed is the exchange of classical information, which combined with the most general local quantum operations gives rise to the class of operations called [[LOCC]] (local operations and classical communication). These operations do not allow the production of entangled states between the systems A and B. But if A and B are provided with a supply of entangled states, then these, together with LOCC operations can enable a larger class of transformations. For example, an interaction between a qubit of A and a qubit of B can be realized by first teleporting A's qubit to B, then letting it interact with B's qubit (which is now a LOCC operation, since both qubits are in B's lab) and then teleporting the qubit back to A. Two maximally entangled states of two qubits are used up in this process. Thus entangled states are a resource that enables the realization of quantum interactions (or of quantum channels) in a setting where only LOCC are available, but they are consumed in the process. There are other applications where entanglement can be seen as a resource, e.g., private communication or distinguishing quantum states.<ref name=\"horodecki2007\" />\n\n=== Classification of entanglement ===\nNot all quantum states are equally valuable as a resource. To quantify this value, different [[Quantum entanglement#Entanglement measures|entanglement measures]] (see below) can be used, that assign a numerical value to each quantum state. However, it is often interesting to settle for a coarser way to compare quantum states. This gives rise to different classification schemes. Most entanglement classes are defined based on whether states can be converted to other states using LOCC or a subclass of these operations. The smaller the set of allowed operations, the finer the classification. Important examples are:\n* If two states can be transformed into each other by a local unitary operation, they are said to be in the same ''LU class''. This is the finest of the usually considered classes. Two states in the same LU class have the same value for entanglement measures and the same value as a resource in the distant-labs setting. There is an infinite number of different LU classes (even in the simplest case of two qubits in a pure state).<ref name=\"GRB1998\">>{{cite journal |author1=Grassl, M. |author2=R\u00f6tteler, M. |author3=Beth, T. |title=Computing local invariants of quantum-bit systems |journal=Phys.

She drags June and her shy, awkward, and decidedly less-talented older sister, Louise, around the country in an effort to get them noticed, and with the assistance of agent Herbie Sommers, she manages to secure them bookings on the prestigious [[Orpheum Circuit Inc.|Orpheum Circuit]].\n\nYears pass, and the girls no longer are young enough to pull off the childlike [[persona]]e their mother insists they continue to project. June rebels, and elopes with Tulsa, one of the dancers who backs the act. Devastated by what she considers an act of betrayal, Rose pours all her energies into making a success of Louise, despite the young woman's obvious lack of singing and dancing skills. Not helping matters is the increasing popularity of [[sound film]]s, which leads to a decline in the demand for stage entertainment. With bookings scarce, mother and daughter find themselves in [[Wichita, Kansas]], where the owner of a third-rate [[burlesque]] house offers Louise a job.\n\nWhen one of the strippers is arrested for soliciting, Louise unwillingly becomes her replacement. At first, her voice is shaky, and her moves tentative at best, but as audiences respond to her, she begins to gain confidence in herself. She blossoms as an entertainer billed as Gypsy Rose Lee, and eventually reaches a point where she tires of her mother's constant interference in both her life and wildly successful career. Louise confronts Rose and demands she leave her alone. Finally, aware that she has spent her life enslaved by a desperate need to be noticed, an angry, bitter, and bewildered Rose stumbles onto the empty stage of the deserted theater and experiences a moment of truth that leads to an emotional breakdown followed by a reconciliation with Louise.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bette Midler]] as [[Rose Thompson Hovick|Rose Hovick]]\n* [[Cynthia Gibb]] as [[Gypsy Rose Lee|Louise Hovick]]\n** [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Baby Louise\n* [[Peter Riegert]] as Herbie Sommers\n* Jennifer Rae Beck as [[June Hovick]]\n** [[Lacey Chabert]] as Baby June\n* [[Ed Asner|Edward Asner]] as Pop\n* [[Linda Hart]] as Miss Mazeppa\n* Anna McNeely as Miss Electra\n* [[Christine Ebersole]] as Tessie Tura\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Mr. Goldstone\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Miss Cratchitt\n* Jeffrey Broadhurst as Tulsa\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Uncle Jocko\n* [[Keene Curtis]] as Mr. Kringelien\n* Spencer Liff as Clarence\n* [[Rachel Sweet]] as Agnes/Amanda\n* [[Peter Lockyer]] as Yonkers\n* Michael Moore as L.A.\n* Patrick Boyd as Kansas\n* Terry Lindholm as Flagstaff\n* [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] ([[archive footage]]) as herself\n\n==Musical numbers==\n# \"Let Me Entertain You\" - Baby June, Baby Louise\n# \"Some People\" - Rose\n# \"Small World\" - Rose and Herbie\n# \"Baby June and Her Newsboys\" - Baby June, Baby Louise, Chorus\n# \"Mr. Goldstone\" - Rose, Herbie, Chorus\n# \"Little Lamb\" - Louise\n# \"You'll Never Get Away from Me\" - Rose, Herbie\n# \"Dainty June and Her Farmboys\" - June, Louise, Chorus\n# \"If Momma Was Married\" - June, Louise\n# \"All I Need is the Girl\" - Tulsa\n# \"Everything's Coming Up Roses\" - Rose\n# \"Together, Wherever We Go\" - Rose, Herbie, Louise\n# \"You Gotta Get a Gimmick\" - Tessie Tura, Miss Mazeppa, Miss Electra\n# \"Small World\" (reprise) - Rose\n# \"Let Me Entertain You\" - Louise\n# \"Rose's Turn\" - Rose\n\n==Production==\nThe film features a [[Film score|score with music]] by [[Jule Styne]] and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]], and reuses the original orchestrations by [[Sid Ramin]] and [[Robert Ginzler]].

The teleplay by [[Arthur Laurents]] is an adaptation of his [[Libretto|book]] of the 1959 stage musical ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'', which was based on ''[[Gypsy: A Memoir]]'' by [[Gypsy Rose Lee]].<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-05/entertainment/ca-64013_1_mama-rose/2|title=They're Coming Up Roses: Bette Midler headlines a new movie version of 'Gypsy,' a rare exact replication of a Broadway show.

E1</ref> in the principal role 10 years earlier, but it required the approval of five entities to obtain the rights. One of the obstacles had been [[Arthur Laurents]] himself, who wrote the book for the musical based on Lee's memoirs.

She drags June and her shy, awkward, and decidedly less-talented older sister, Louise, around the country in an effort to get them noticed, and with the assistance of agent Herbie Sommers, she manages to secure them bookings on the prestigious [[Orpheum Circuit Inc.|Orpheum Circuit]].\n\nYears pass, and the girls no longer are young enough to pull off the childlike [[persona]]e their mother insists they continue to project. June rebels, and elopes with Tulsa, one of the dancers who backs the act. Devastated by what she considers an act of betrayal, Rose pours all her energies into making a success of Louise, despite the young woman's obvious lack of singing and dancing skills. Not helping matters is the increasing popularity of [[sound film]]s, which leads to a decline in the demand for stage entertainment. With bookings scarce, mother and daughter find themselves in [[Wichita, Kansas]], where the owner of a third-rate [[burlesque]] house offers Louise a job.\n\nWhen one of the strippers is arrested for soliciting, Louise unwillingly becomes her replacement. At first, her voice is shaky, and her moves tentative at best, but as audiences respond to her, she begins to gain confidence in herself. She blossoms as an entertainer billed as Gypsy Rose Lee, and eventually reaches a point where she tires of her mother's constant interference in both her life and wildly successful career. Louise confronts Rose and demands she leave her alone. Finally, aware that she has spent her life enslaved by a desperate need to be noticed, an angry, bitter, and bewildered Rose stumbles onto the empty stage of the deserted theater and experiences a moment of truth that leads to an emotional breakdown followed by a reconciliation with Louise.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bette Midler]] as [[Rose Thompson Hovick|Rose Hovick]]\n* [[Cynthia Gibb]] as [[Gypsy Rose Lee|Louise Hovick]]\n** [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Baby Louise\n* [[Peter Riegert]] as Herbie Sommers\n* Jennifer Rae Beck as [[June Hovick]]\n** [[Lacey Chabert]] as Baby June\n* [[Ed Asner|Edward Asner]] as Pop\n* [[Linda Hart]] as Miss Mazeppa\n* Anna McNeely as Miss Electra\n* [[Christine Ebersole]] as Tessie Tura\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Mr. Goldstone\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Miss Cratchitt\n* Jeffrey Broadhurst as Tulsa\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Uncle Jocko\n* [[Keene Curtis]] as Mr. Kringelien\n* Spencer Liff as Clarence\n* [[Rachel Sweet]] as Agnes/Amanda\n* [[Peter Lockyer]] as Yonkers\n* Michael Moore as L.A.\n* Patrick Boyd as Kansas\n* Terry Lindholm as Flagstaff\n* [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] ([[archive footage]]) as herself\n\n==Musical numbers==\n# \"Let Me Entertain You\" - Baby June, Baby Louise\n# \"Some People\" - Rose\n# \"Small World\" - Rose and Herbie\n# \"Baby June and Her Newsboys\" - Baby June, Baby Louise, Chorus\n# \"Mr. Goldstone\" - Rose, Herbie, Chorus\n# \"Little Lamb\" - Louise\n# \"You'll Never Get Away from Me\" - Rose, Herbie\n# \"Dainty June and Her Farmboys\" - June, Louise, Chorus\n# \"If Momma Was Married\" - June, Louise\n# \"All I Need is the Girl\" - Tulsa\n# \"Everything's Coming Up Roses\" - Rose\n# \"Together, Wherever We Go\" - Rose, Herbie, Louise\n# \"You Gotta Get a Gimmick\" - Tessie Tura, Miss Mazeppa, Miss Electra\n# \"Small World\" (reprise) - Rose\n# \"Let Me Entertain You\" - Louise\n# \"Rose's Turn\" - Rose\n\n==Production==\nThe film features a [[Film score|score with music]] by [[Jule Styne]] and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]], and reuses the original orchestrations by [[Sid Ramin]] and [[Robert Ginzler]].

The Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiff, [[Michael Newdow]], not on the substantive legal issue but on a technicality, declaring that he lacked [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] because he did not have [[Child custody|custody]] of his daughter, on whose behalf he had brought the suit. Newdow subsequently filed a second case, and in 2010, the Ninth Circuit reversed its earlier decision and ruled that the \"under God\" wording did not violate the Establishment Clause.<ref>http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/11/05-17257.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Supreme Court ruled against the Freedom From Religion Foundation in ''[[Hein v.

{"title_page": "Puebloans", "text_new": "{{about||the minor league baseball team|Pueblo Indians (baseball)|the ancient Puebloans|Ancestral Puebloans}}\n\nThe '''Puebloans''' or '''Pueblo peoples''', are [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the [[Southwestern United States]] who share common agricultural, material and religious practices. When [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spaniards entered the area]] beginning in the [[16th century]], they came across complex, multi-story villages built of [[adobe]], stone and other local materials, which they called [[pueblo]]s, or ''villages'', a term that later came to refer also to the peoples who live in these villages.\n\nThere are currently 100 Pueblos that are still inhabited, among which [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]], [[San Ildefonso Pueblo|San Ildefonso]], [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]], [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico|Zuni]], and [[Hopi]] are the best-known. Pueblo communities are located in the present-day states of [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and [[Texas]], mostly along the [[Rio Grande]] and [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado]] rivers and their [[Tributary|tributaries]]. The term ''[[Anasazi]]'' is sometimes used to refer to ancestral Pueblo people but it is now largely dispreferred. ''Anasazi'' is a [[Navajo language|Navajo]] word that means ''Ancient Ones'' or ''Ancient Enemy'', hence Pueblo peoples' rejection of it (see [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]]).\n\nPuebloans speak languages from four different [[Language family|language families]], and each Pueblo is further divided culturally by kinship systems and agricultural practices, although all cultivate varieties of [[maize]].\n\nDespite increasing pressure from Spanish and later Anglo-American forces, Pueblo nations have maintained much of their traditional cultures, which center around agricultural practices, a tight-knit community revolving around family clans and respect for tradition. Puebloans have been remarkably adept at preserving their core religious beliefs all the while developing a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] approach to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book |title=Pueblo nations : eight centuries of Pueblo Indian history |last=Sando |first=Joe S. |date=1992 |publisher=Clear Light |isbn=0940666170 |edition=1st |location=Santa Fe, NM |oclc=24174245 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/pueblonationseig0000sand }}</ref> In the 21st century, some 35,000 Pueblo are estimated to live in New Mexico and Arizona.\n\n== Subdivisions ==\n[[File:Pueblo01.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Pueblos in New Mexico]]\nDespite various similarities in cultural and religious practices, scholars have proposed divisions of contemporary Pueblos into smaller groups based on [[linguistics|linguistic]] and individual manifestations of the broader Puebloan culture.\n\n=== Divisions based on linguistic affiliation ===\nThe clearest division between Puebloans relates to the languages they speak. Pueblo peoples speak languages from four distinct [[language families]], which means these languages are completely different in [[lexicon|vocabulary]], [[morphosyntax|grammar]] and most other linguistic aspects. As a result, each Pueblo language is often completely unintelligible to the other languages, with English now working as the [[lingua franca]] of the region.\n\n* [[Keresan languages|Keresan]]: family to which Western and Eastern Keres belong, considered by some a language isolate consisting of a [[dialect continuum]] spoken at the pueblos of Acoma, [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]], [[Santa Ana Pueblo, New Mexico|Santa Ana]], [[Zia Pueblo, New Mexico|Zia]], [[Cochiti, New Mexico|Cochiti]], [[Kewa Pueblo, New Mexico|Kewa]], and [[San Felipe Pueblo, New Mexico|San Felipe]]. \n* [[Kiowa-Tanoan languages|Kiowa-Tanoan:]] stock to which the Tanoan (or Puebloan) branch belongs, consisting of three separate sub-branches:  \n** [[Towa language|Towa]]: currently solely spoken at [[Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico|Jemez Pueblo]].  \n** [[Tewa language|Tewa]]: the most widespread Tanoan language with several dialects, spoken at [[Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico|Ohkay Owingeh]], [[San Ildefonso Pueblo, New Mexico|San Ildefonso]], [[Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico|Santa Clara]], [[Tesuque Pueblo, New Mexico|Tesuque]], [[Namb\u00e9 Pueblo, New Mexico|Namb\u00e9]], and [[Pojoaque, New Mexico|Pojoaque]] Pueblos.  \n** Tiwa: the only Tanoan sub-branch consisting of separate languages:<ref name=\":1\" /> \n*** Northern Tiwa: a language with two dialects, one spoken at [[Taos language|Taos]] and the other at [[Picuris]]. \n*** [[Southern Tiwa]]: also consisting of two dialects, spoken at [[Sandia Pueblo|Sandia]] and [[Pueblo of Isleta|Isleta]] Pueblos.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/664337?seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents JSTOR summary, Harry Hoijer,\"American Indian Linguistics in the Southwest: Comments\" ''American Anthropologist''New Series, Vol. 56, No. 4, Southwest Issue (Aug., 1954), pp. 637-639]</ref> \n* [[Uto-Aztecan]]: stock to which [[Hopi language|Hopi]] belongs, spoken exclusively at Hopi Pueblo. \n* [[Zuni language|Zuni]]: family to which Zuni belongs; it is a [[language isolate]], currently spoken exclusively at Zuni Pueblo.\n\n=== Divisions based on cultural practices ===\n\n==== Farming techniques ====\n[[File:Debra Haaland on Insight New Mexico.jpg|thumb|[[Debra Haaland]], one of the first Native women elected for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], is puebloan (Laguna)]]\nAnthropologists have studied Pueblo peoples extensively and published various classifications of their subdivisions. In 1950, [[Fred Eggan|Fred Russell Eggan]] contrasted the peoples of the Eastern and Western Pueblos, based largely on their subsistence farming techniques.<ref>[[Fred Eggan|Fred Russell Eggan]], ''Social Organization of the Western Pueblos'', University of Chicago Press, 1950.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed, if any--></ref>\n\nThe Western or Desert Pueblos of the Zuni and Hopi specialize in [[dry farming]], compared to the [[irrigation]] farmers of the Eastern or River Pueblos. Both groups cultivate mostly [[maize]] (corn), but squash and beans have also been staple Pueblo foods all around the region.\n\n==== Kinship systems and religion ====\nIn 1954, Paul Kirchhoff published a division of Pueblo peoples into two groups based on culture.<ref name=\"Kirchhoff,1954\">[[Paul Kirchhoff]], [https://www.jstor.org/pss/664319 \"Gatherers and Farmers in the Greater Southwest: A Problem in Classification\"], ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. '''56''', No. 4, Southwest Issue (August 1954), pp. 529-550<!-- JSTOR --></ref> The [[Hopi]], [[Zuni people|Zuni]], [[Keres people|Keres]] and [[Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico|Jemez]] each have [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] kinship systems: children are considered born into their mother's clan and must marry a spouse outside it, an [[exogamous]] practice. They maintain multiple [[kiva]]s for sacred ceremonies. Their [[creation story]] tells that humans emerged from the underground. They emphasize four or six cardinal directions as part of their sacred cosmology, beginning in the north. Four and seven are numbers considered significant in their rituals and symbolism.<ref name=\"Kirchhoff,1954\" />\n\nIn contrast, the [[Tanoan]]-speaking Puebloans (other than Jemez) have a patrilineal kinship system, with children considered born into their father's clan. They practice [[endogamy]], or marriage within the clan. They have two kivas or two groups of kivas in their pueblos. Their belief system is based in [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. Their creation story recounts the emergence of the people from underwater. They use five directions, beginning in the west. Their ritual numbers are based on multiples of three.<ref name=\"Kirchhoff,1954\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Precursors ===\nPuebloan societies contain elements of three major [[culture]]s that dominated the Southwest United States region before European contact: the ''Mogollon Culture'', whose adherents occupied an area near [[Gila Wilderness]]; the ''Hohokam Culture''; and the ''Ancestral Puebloan Culture'' who occupied the [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde region]] of the [[Four Corners]] area.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Cordell, Linda S. ''Ancient Pueblo Peoples,'' St. Remy Press and Smithsonian Institution (1994); {{ISBN|0-89599-038-5}}.</ref>\n\n==== Mogollon culture ====\n{{Further|Mogollon culture}}\nArcheological evidence suggest that people partaking in the Mogollon [[Help:IPA/English|/mo\u028a\u0261\u0259\u02c8jo\u028an/]] culture were initially [[Hunter-gatherer|foragers]] who augmented their subsistence through the development of farming. Around the first millennium CE, however, farming became the main means to obtain food. [[Irrigation|Water control]] features are common among Mimbres branch sites, which date from the [[10th century|10th]] through [[12th century|12th centuries]] CE.\n\nThe nature and density of Mogollon residential villages changed through time. The earliest Mogollon villages were small [[hamlets]] composed of several [[Pit-house|pithouses]] (houses excavated into the ground surface, with stick and thatch roofs supported by a network of posts and beams, and faced on the exterior with earth). Village sizes increased over time and, by the [[11th century]], villages composed of ground level dwellings made with rock and earth walls, with roofs supported by post and beam networks, became common. [[Cliff-dwelling]]s became common during the [[13th century|13th]] and [[14th century|14th centuries]].\n\n==== Hohokam culture ====\n{{Further|Hohokam culture}}\nHohokam is term borrowed from the [[O'odham language]], used to define an archaeological culture that relied on irrigation canals to water their crops since as early as the [[9th century|9th century CE]]. Their irrigation system techniques allowed for its adherents to expand into the largest population in the Southwest by 1300. Archaeologists working at a major archaeological dig in the 1990s in the [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson Basin]], along the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River,]] identified a culture and people that were ancestors of the Hohokam who might have occupied southern Arizona as early as 2000 BCE. This prehistoric group from the Early Agricultural Period grew corn, lived year-round in sedentary villages, and developed sophisticated irrigation canals from the beginning of the common era to about the middle of the 15th century.\n\nWithin a larger context, the Hohokam culture area inhabited a central trade position between the [[Patayan]] situated along the Lower [[Colorado River]] and in southern California; the [[Trincheras]] of [[Sonora]], Mexico; the [[Mogollon culture]] in eastern Arizona, southwest New Mexico, and northwest [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], Mexico; and the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] in northern Arizona, northern New Mexico, southwest Colorado, and southern [[Utah]].\n\n==== Ancestral Puebloan culture ====\n{{Further|Ancestral Puebloans}}\nThe Ancestral Puebloan culture is known for the stone and earth dwellings its people built along cliff walls, particularly during the [[Pueblo II Era|Pueblo II]] and [[Pueblo III Era|Pueblo III]] eras, from about 900 to 1350 CE in total. The best-preserved examples of the stone dwellings are now protected within United States' [[national parks]], such as [[Navajo National Monument]], [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park]], [[Mesa Verde National Park]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Aztec Ruins National Monument]], [[Bandelier National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], and [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument]].\n\nThese villages were accessible only by rope or through rock climbing. However, the first Ancestral Puebloan homes and villages were based on the pit-house, a common feature in the [[Basketmaker culture|Basketmaker]] periods. Villages consisted of apartment-like complexes and structures made from stone, adobe mud, and other local materials, or were carved into the sides of [[canyon]] walls. Design details from Ancestral Puebloan villages contain elements from cultures as far away as present-day [[Mexico]].\n\nIn their day, these ancient towns and cities were usually multistoried and multipurposed buildings surrounding open [[plaza]]s and [[viewshed]]s. They were occupied by hundreds to thousands of Ancestral Pueblo peoples. These population complexes hosted cultural and civic events and infrastructure that supported a vast outlying region hundreds of miles away linked by transportation roadways.\n\n=== Pueblo architecture and the rise of the Puebloan city state ===\n{{further|Ancient dwellings of Pueblo peoples}}\n[[File:Pueblo Bonito, Chaco Canyon.tif|thumb|Ruins of Pueblo Bonito, in Chaco Canyon|316x316px]]\nBy about 700 to 900 CE, the Puebloans began to move away from ancient pit houses dug in cliffs and to construct connected rectangular rooms arranged in apartment-like structures made of adobe and adapted to sites. By 1050, they had developed planned villages composed of large terraced buildings, each with many rooms. These apartment-house villages were often constructed on defensive sites: on ledges of massive rock, on flat summits, or on steep-sided mesas, locations that would afford the Puebloans protection from raiding parties originating from the north, such as the [[Comanche people|Comanche]] and Navajo. The largest of these villages, [[Pueblo Bonito]] in [[Chaco Canyon]], New Mexico, contained around 700 rooms in five stories; it may have housed as many as 1000 persons.<ref>Nash, Gary B. ''Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America'' Los Angeles (2015). Chapter 1, p. 4 {{ISBN|978-0205887590}}</ref>\n\nPueblo buildings are constructed as complex apartments with numerous rooms, often built in strategic defensive positions. The most highly developed were large villages or pueblos situated at the very top of the [[mesa]]s, the rocky tablelands typical to the Southwest.\n\n=== European contact ===\nBefore 1598, Spanish exploration of the present-day Pueblo areas was limited to an assortment of small groups. A group of colonizers led by [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]] arrived at the end of the 16th Century as part of an apostolic mission to convert the Natives. Despite initial peaceful contact, Spain's attempts to dispose of Pueblo religion and replace it with Catholicism became increasingly more aggressive, and were met with great resistance by Puebloans, whose governmental structure was based around the figure of the [[cacique]], a [[Theocracy|theocratic]] leader for both material and spiritual matters.<ref name=\":2\" />  Over the years, Spaniards' methods grew harsher, leading to a series of revolts by the Puebloans.\n\n==== Pueblo Revolt ====\n{{Main|Pueblo Revolt}}\n[[File:Jemez Pueblo shield, circa 1840.JPG|thumb|Jemez Pueblo shield, circa 1840]]\nThe '''Pueblo Revolt''' that started in 1680 was the first led by a Native American group to successfully expel colonists from North America for a considerable number of years. It followed the successful [[Tiguex War]] led by Tiwas against the [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado|Coronado Expedition]] in 1540\u201341, which temporarily halted Spanish advances in present-day New Mexico. The [[17th Century]]'s revolt was a direct consequence of growing discontent among the Northern Pueblos against the abuses of the Spaniards, which finally brewed into a large organized uprising against European colonizers.\n[[File:PopeUnveiling1.jpg|thumb|upright|Unveiling and dedication of [[Pop\u00e9]] statue by sculptor [[Cliff Fragua]] in the Capitol in Washington DC, September 2005]]\nThe events that led to the Pueblo Revolt go back at least a decade before the formal uprising began. In the 1670s, severe drought swept the region, which caused both a famine among the Pueblo and increased the frequency of raids by the [[Apache]]. Neither Spanish nor Pueblo soldiers were able to prevent the attacks by the Apache raiding parties.\n\nThe unrest among the Pueblos came to a head in 1675, when Governor [[Juan Francisco Trevi\u00f1o]] ordered the arrest of forty-seven Pueblo [[Medicine man|medicine men]] and accused them of practicing [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. Four of the medicine men were sentenced to death by hanging; three of those sentences were carried out, while the fourth prisoner committed suicide. The remaining men were publicly whipped and sentenced to prison.\n\nWhen the news of the killings and public humiliation reached Pueblo leaders, they moved in force to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], where the prisoners were held. Because a large number of Spanish soldiers were away fighting the Apache, Governor Trevi\u00f1o was forced to release the prisoners. Among those released was an [[Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo|Ohkay Owingeh]] Tewa man named [[Pop\u00e9]].\n\nAfter being released, Pop\u00e9 took up residence in [[Taos Pueblo]] far from the capital of Santa Fe and spent the next five years seeking support for a revolt among the 46 Pueblo villages. He was able to gain the support of the Northern [[Tiwa Puebloans|Tiwa]], [[Tewa]], [[Jemez language|Towa]], [[Potou\u2013Tano languages|Tano]], and [[Keresan languages|Keres]]-speaking Pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. The [[Pecos National Historical Park|Pecos]] Pueblo, 50 miles east of the Rio Grande pledged its participation in the revolt as did the [[Zuni people|Zuni]] and [[Hopi]], 120 and 200 miles respectively west of the Rio Grande. At the time, the Spanish population was of about 2,400 colonists, including mixed-blood [[mestizo]]s, and Indian servants and retainers, who were scattered thinly throughout the region.\n\nStarting early on August 10, 1680, Pop\u00e9 and leaders of each of the Pueblos sent a knotted rope carried by a runner to the next Pueblo; the number of knots signified the number of days to wait before beginning the uprising. Finally, on August 21, 2,500 Puebloan warriors took the colony's capital [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] from Spanish control, killing many colonizers, the remainder of whom were successfully expelled.<ref>[[Paul Horgan]] (1954), ''Great River'' vol. 1, p. 286. {{LCCN|549867}}</ref>\n\n===== Legacy and honors =====\n\nOn September 22, 2005, the statue of Po'pay ([[Pop\u00e9]]), the leader of the Pueblo Revolt, was unveiled in the Capitol Rotunda in [[Washington, D.C.]] The statue was the second commissioned by the state of New Mexico for [[National Statuary Hall]]; it was the 100th and last to be added to the collection, which represents the Senate. It was created by [[Cliff Fragua]], a Puebloan from [[Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico]]. It is the only statue in the collection to be created by a Native American.<ref>[http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/09/22/S10371_dedication-of-the-statue-of-popay/ Po'pay dedication]</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Zuni exhibit 1915b.jpg|thumb|A Zuni drying platform for maize and other foods, with two women crafting pottery beneath it. From the [[Panama-California Exposition (1915)|Panama-California Exposition]], San Diego, California.

Indeed, they are now considered the best horticulturists in the country, furnishing most of the fruits and a large portion of the vegetable supplies that are to be found in the markets. They were until very lately the only people in New Mexico who cultivated the grape. They also maintain at the present time considerable herds of cattle, horses, etc. They are, in short, a remarkably sober and industrious race, conspicuous for morality and honesty, and very little given to quarrelling or dissipation ... ''</blockquote>\n\n=== Material culture ===\n[[File:Tribal Council Building, Isleta Pueblo NM.jpg|thumb|[[Tribal Council]] Building at Isleta Pueblo|350x350px]]\n\n==== Clothing ====\nThe Puebloans are traditional weavers of cloth and have used textiles, [[natural fiber]]s and [[Hide (skin)|animal hide]] in their cloth-making. Since woven clothing is laborious and time-consuming, every-day style of dress for working around the villages has been more spare. The men often wore breechcloths.\n\n==== Agriculture ====\n{{Main|Agriculture in the prehistoric Southwest}}\nCorn is the most readily recognizable [[staple food]] for Pueblo peoples. Although it is possible that different groups may have grown local plants such as [[gourd]]s and [[Chenopodium|chenopods]] at very early dates, the first evidence of maize cultivation in the Southwest dates from about 2100 BCE. Small, fairly undomesticated maize cobs have been found at five different sites in New Mexico and Arizona.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Merril|first=William L.|date=2009|title=The Diffusion of Maize to the Southwest United States and its Impact|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=106 (50)|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nMaize reached the present-day Southwest via an unknown route from [[Mexico]] and was rapidly adopted by peoples in the region. One theory states that maize cultivation was carried northward from central Mexico by migrating farmers, most likely speakers of a [[Uto-Aztecan]] language. Another theory, more accepted among scholars, is that maize was diffused northward from group to group rather than migrants. There is evidence that maize was initially cultivated in the Southwest during a [[Climate change (general concept)|climatic period]] when [[precipitation]] was relatively high.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Pottery ====\nThe various Pueblo communities have different traditions regarding the making and decoration of pottery artifacts. Present-day archaeologists date the use of pottery by Puebloans dating back the early centuries of the Common Era.<ref>Mera, H.P., Pueblo Designs: 176 Illustrations of the \"Rain Bird'', Dover Publications, Inc, 1970, first published by the Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe, New Mexico (1937), p. 1''</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"190px\">\nFile:Hopi canteen p1070217.jpg|[[Zuni people|Zuni]] olla, 19th century, at [[Stanford University]] <!-- misnamed object! -->\nFile:SanIldefonsoBowl1.jpg|[[San Ildefonso Pueblo]] Black-on-Black Pottery Bowl by [[Maria Martinez]]\nFile:Zuni figure (UBC-2011).jpg|[[Zuni people|Zuni]] owl figure, [[University of British Columbia]]\nFile:AcomaJar2.jpg|Acoma Pueblo, pottery jar, Field Museum\nFile:TesuqueJar1.jpg|Tesuque Pueblo, Pottery, Field Museum\nFile:BirdEffigyJarCicuye1.jpg|Bird effigy, pottery, [[Cochiti Pueblo]].

A vast collection of religious stories explore the relationships among people and nature, including plants and animals. [[Spider Grandmother]] and [[kachina]] spirits figure prominently in some myths.  [[File:Ohkay Owingeh0.jpg|thumb|right|Dancers at [[Ohkay Owingeh]]|278x278px]]Pueblo prayer included substances as well as words; one common prayer material was ground-up [[maize]]\u2014white [[cornmeal]]. A man might bless his son, or some land, or the town by sprinkling a handful of meal as he uttered a blessing. After the 1692 re-conquest, the Spanish were prevented from entering one town when they were met by a handful of men who uttered imprecations and cast a single pinch of a sacred substance.<ref>Paul Horgan, ''Great River'' p. 158</ref>\n\nThe Pueblo peoples used ritual 'prayer sticks', which were colorfully decorated with beads, fur, and feathers. These prayer sticks (or 'talking sticks') were similar to those used by other Native American nations. By the 13th century, Puebloans used turkey feather blankets for warmth.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news184834568.html \"Turkeys domesticated not once, but twice\"], physorg.com; accessed September 2015.</ref>\n\nMost of the Pueblos hold annual sacred ceremonies, some of which are now open to the public.\n\nReligious ceremonies usually feature traditional dances that are held outdoors in the large common areas and courtyards, which are accompanied by singing and drumming. Unlike kiva ceremonies, traditional dances may be open to non-Puebloans. Traditional dances are considered a form of prayer, and strict rules of conduct apply to those who wish to attend one (e.g. no clapping or walking across the dance area or between the dancers, singers, or drummers).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://santafe.com/article/showing-respect-etiquette-when-attending-native-american-dances-and-feast-d|title=Pueblo religious etiquette|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n[[File:The Kiva at Nambe Pueblo NM.jpg|thumb|Kiva at [[Namb\u00e9 Pueblo, New Mexico|Namb\u00e9 Pueblo]]|294x294px]]\n<blockquote>''Since time immemorial, Pueblo communities have celebrated seasonal cycles through prayer, song, and dance. These dances connect us to our ancestors, community, and traditions while honoring gifts from our Creator. They ensure that life continues and that connections to the past and future are reinforced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/indianpueblo/photos/a.99140036754.104107.65392431754/10154833545041755/?type=3&theater|title=Indian Pueblo Cultural Center|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>''</blockquote>Traditionally, all outside visitors to a public dance would be offered a meal afterward in a Pueblo home. Because of the numerous outside tourists who have attended these dances in the pueblos since the late 20th century, such meals are now open to outsiders by personal invitation only. Private sacred ceremonies are conducted inside the [[kiva]]s and only tribal members may participate according to specific rules pertaining to each Pueblo's religion.\n\nThe public observances may also include a Roman Catholic [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] and processions on the Pueblo's feast day. Some Pueblos also hold sacred ceremonies around [[Christmas]] and at other Christian holidays.\n\n==== Catholicism ====\nOne of the primary goals of Spanish colonists in the 17th Century was the desire to bring Christianity to Natives in New Spain. Franciscan priests had prepared for a long process of conversion, building churches and missions all around Pueblo country. Pueblos' feast days are a product of that process. Feast days are held on the day sacred to its [[Roman Catholic]] [[patron saint]], assigned by Spanish missionaries so that each Pueblo's feast day would coincide with one of the people's existing traditional ceremonies. About the imposition of Christianity, [[Alfonso Ortiz]], an Ohkay Owingeh anthropologist and Pueblo specialist states:<blockquote>''The Spanish government demanded labor and tribute from the Pueblos and vigorously attempted to suppress native religion. (...) In that year'' [1692] ''Diego de Vargas re-entered Pueblo territory, though it was not until 1696 that he gained control over the entire Rio Grande Pueblo area. The Spaniards had learned from the Pueblo Revolt and were gentler in their demands in the next century and a half. However, the Pueblos had learned as well and maintained their ceremonial life out of the view of the Spaniards, while adopting a veneer of Roman Catholicism.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the North American Indian - Volume 9 The Southwest|last=Ortiz|first=Alfonso|publisher=|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=4}}</ref></blockquote><br />\n\n== List of Pueblos ==\n=== New Mexico ===\n{{further|List of ancient dwellings of Pueblo peoples in New Mexico}}\n\n* [[Acoma Pueblo]] \u2013 [[Keres language|Keres]] speakers.

The San Elizario mission was administrative (that is, non Puebloan).\n* Some of the [[Piro Pueblos|Piro Puebloans]] settled in Senecu, and then in [[Socorro, Texas]], adjacent to [[Ysleta, Texas|Ysleta]] (which is now within El Paso city limits).

The names used by each Pueblo to refer to their village (''endonyms'') usually differs from those given to them by outsiders (their ''exonyms''), including by speakers of other Puebloan languages. Centuries of trade and intermarriages between the groups are reflected in the names given to the same Pueblo in each of the languages. The table below contains the names of the New Mexican pueblos and Hopi using the official or practical orthographies of the languages. Despite not being a Puebloan language, [[Navajo language|Navajo]] names are also included due to prolonged contact between them and the several Pueblos.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English/Spanish Name\n![[Exonym and endonym|Endonym]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=Handbook of the North American Indians |last=Sturtevant |first=William C. |date=1978-2008 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=0160045770 |oclc=13240086}}</ref>\n!Navajo<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Navajo language : a grammar and colloquial dictionary |last=Young |first=Robert W. |date=1980 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |last2=Morgan |first2=William |isbn=0826305369|edition=1st |location=Albuquerque |oclc=6597162}}</ref>\n!Keres<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://keres.co/|title=Keres Language Project|website=Keres Language Project|access-date=November 13, 2018}}</ref>\n!Tewa<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Kiowa-Tanoan: A Synchronic and Diachronic Study|last=Sutton|first=Logan|publisher=University of New Mexico|year=2014|isbn=|location=Albuquerque, NM|pages=}}</ref>\n!Tiwa<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n!Towa<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=A Phonology and morphology of Jemez Towa|last=Yumitani|first=Yukihiro|publisher=University of Kansas Dissertation|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n!Hopi<ref>{{Cite book |title=A concise Hopi and English lexicon |last=Albert |first=Roy |date=1985 |publisher=J.

When [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spaniards entered the area]] beginning in the [[16th century]], they came across complex, multi-story villages built of [[adobe]], stone and other local materials, which they called [[pueblo]]s, or ''villages'', a term that later came to refer also to the peoples who live in these villages.\n\nThere are currently 100 Pueblos that are still inhabited, among which [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]], [[San Ildefonso Pueblo|San Ildefonso]], [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]], [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico|Zuni]], and [[Hopi]] are the best-known. Pueblo communities are located in the present-day states of [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and [[Texas]], mostly along the [[Rio Grande]] and [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado]] rivers and their [[Tributary|tributaries]]. The term ''[[Anasazi]]'' is sometimes used to refer to ancestral Pueblo people but it is now largely dispreferred. ''Anasazi'' is a [[Navajo language|Navajo]] word that means ''Ancient Ones'' or ''Ancient Enemy'', hence Pueblo peoples' rejection of it (see [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]]).\n\nPuebloans speak languages from four different [[Language family|language families]], and each Pueblo is further divided culturally by kinship systems and agricultural practices, although all cultivate varieties of [[maize]].\n\nDespite increasing pressure from Spanish and later Anglo-American forces, Pueblo nations have maintained much of their traditional cultures, which center around agricultural practices, a tight-knit community revolving around family clans and respect for tradition. Puebloans have been remarkably adept at preserving their core religious beliefs all the while developing a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] approach to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book |title=Pueblo nations : eight centuries of Pueblo Indian history |last=Sando |first=Joe S. |date=1992 |publisher=Clear Light |isbn=0940666170 |edition=1st |location=Santa Fe, NM |oclc=24174245 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/pueblonationseig0000sand }}</ref> In the 21st century, some 35,000 Pueblo are estimated to live in New Mexico and Arizona.\n\n== Subdivisions ==\n[[File:Pueblo01.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Pueblos in New Mexico]]\nDespite various similarities in cultural and religious practices, scholars have proposed divisions of contemporary Pueblos into smaller groups based on [[linguistics|linguistic]] and individual manifestations of the broader Puebloan culture.\n\n=== Divisions based on linguistic affiliation ===\nThe clearest division between Puebloans relates to the languages they speak. Pueblo peoples speak languages from four distinct [[language families]], which means these languages are completely different in [[lexicon|vocabulary]], [[morphosyntax|grammar]] and most other linguistic aspects. As a result, each Pueblo language is often completely unintelligible to the other languages, with English now working as the [[lingua franca]] of the region.\n\n* [[Keresan languages|Keresan]]: family to which Western and Eastern Keres belong, considered by some a language isolate consisting of a [[dialect continuum]] spoken at the pueblos of Acoma, [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]], [[Santa Ana Pueblo, New Mexico|Santa Ana]], [[Zia Pueblo, New Mexico|Zia]], [[Cochiti, New Mexico|Cochiti]], [[Kewa Pueblo, New Mexico|Kewa]], and [[San Felipe Pueblo, New Mexico|San Felipe]]. \n* [[Kiowa-Tanoan languages|Kiowa-Tanoan:]] stock to which the Tanoan (or Puebloan) branch belongs, consisting of three separate sub-branches:  \n** [[Towa language|Towa]]: currently solely spoken at [[Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico|Jemez Pueblo]].  \n** [[Tewa language|Tewa]]: the most widespread Tanoan language with several dialects, spoken at [[Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico|Ohkay Owingeh]], [[San Ildefonso Pueblo, New Mexico|San Ildefonso]], [[Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico|Santa Clara]], [[Tesuque Pueblo, New Mexico|Tesuque]], [[Namb\u00e9 Pueblo, New Mexico|Namb\u00e9]], and [[Pojoaque, New Mexico|Pojoaque]] Pueblos.  \n** Tiwa: the only Tanoan sub-branch consisting of separate languages:<ref name=\":1\" /> \n*** Northern Tiwa: a language with two dialects, one spoken at [[Taos language|Taos]] and the other at [[Picuris]]. \n*** [[Southern Tiwa]]: also consisting of two dialects, spoken at [[Sandia Pueblo|Sandia]] and [[Pueblo of Isleta|Isleta]] Pueblos.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/664337?seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents JSTOR summary, Harry Hoijer,\"American Indian Linguistics in the Southwest: Comments\" ''American Anthropologist''New Series, Vol. 56, No. 4, Southwest Issue (Aug., 1954), pp. 637-639]</ref> \n* [[Uto-Aztecan]]: stock to which [[Hopi language|Hopi]] belongs, spoken exclusively at Hopi Pueblo. \n* [[Zuni language|Zuni]]: family to which Zuni belongs; it is a [[language isolate]], currently spoken exclusively at Zuni Pueblo.\n\n=== Divisions based on cultural practices ===\n\n==== Farming techniques ====\n[[File:Debra Haaland on Insight New Mexico.jpg|thumb|[[Debra Haaland]], one of the first Native women elected for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], is puebloan (Laguna)]]\nAnthropologists have studied Pueblo peoples extensively and published various classifications of their subdivisions. In 1950, [[Fred Eggan|Fred Russell Eggan]] contrasted the peoples of the Eastern and Western Pueblos, based largely on their subsistence farming techniques.<ref>[[Fred Eggan|Fred Russell Eggan]], ''Social Organization of the Western Pueblos'', University of Chicago Press, 1950.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed, if any--></ref>\n\nThe Western or Desert Pueblos of the Zuni and Hopi specialize in [[dry farming]], compared to the [[irrigation]] farmers of the Eastern or River Pueblos. Both groups cultivate mostly [[maize]] (corn), but squash and beans have also been staple Pueblo foods all around the region.\n\n==== Kinship systems and religion ====\nIn 1954, Paul Kirchhoff published a division of Pueblo peoples into two groups based on culture.<ref name=\"Kirchhoff,1954\">[[Paul Kirchhoff]], [https://www.jstor.org/pss/664319 \"Gatherers and Farmers in the Greater Southwest: A Problem in Classification\"], ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. '''56''', No. 4, Southwest Issue (August 1954), pp. 529-550<!-- JSTOR --></ref> The [[Hopi]], [[Zuni people|Zuni]], [[Keres people|Keres]] and [[Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico|Jemez]] each have [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] kinship systems: children are considered born into their mother's clan and must marry a spouse outside it, an [[exogamous]] practice. They maintain multiple [[kiva]]s for sacred ceremonies. Their [[creation story]] tells that humans emerged from the underground. They emphasize four or six cardinal directions as part of their sacred cosmology, beginning in the north. Four and seven are numbers considered significant in their rituals and symbolism.<ref name=\"Kirchhoff,1954\" />\n\nIn contrast, the [[Tanoan]]-speaking Puebloans (other than Jemez) have a patrilineal kinship system, with children considered born into their father's clan. They practice [[endogamy]], or marriage within the clan. They have two kivas or two groups of kivas in their pueblos. Their belief system is based in [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. Their creation story recounts the emergence of the people from underwater. They use five directions, beginning in the west. Their ritual numbers are based on multiples of three.<ref name=\"Kirchhoff,1954\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Precursors ===\nPuebloan societies contain elements of three major [[culture]]s that dominated the Southwest United States region before European contact: the ''Mogollon Culture'', whose adherents occupied an area near [[Gila Wilderness]]; the ''Hohokam Culture''; and the ''Ancestral Puebloan Culture'' who occupied the [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde region]] of the [[Four Corners]] area.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Cordell, Linda S. ''Ancient Pueblo Peoples,'' St. Remy Press and Smithsonian Institution (1994); {{ISBN|0-89599-038-5}}.</ref>\n\n==== Mogollon culture ====\n{{Further|Mogollon culture}}\nArcheological evidence suggest that people partaking in the Mogollon [[Help:IPA/English|/mo\u028a\u0261\u0259\u02c8jo\u028an/]] culture were initially [[Hunter-gatherer|foragers]] who augmented their subsistence through the development of farming. Around the first millennium CE, however, farming became the main means to obtain food. [[Irrigation|Water control]] features are common among Mimbres branch sites, which date from the [[10th century|10th]] through [[12th century|12th centuries]] CE.\n\nThe nature and density of Mogollon residential villages changed through time. The earliest Mogollon villages were small [[hamlets]] composed of several [[Pit-house|pithouses]] (houses excavated into the ground surface, with stick and thatch roofs supported by a network of posts and beams, and faced on the exterior with earth). Village sizes increased over time and, by the [[11th century]], villages composed of ground level dwellings made with rock and earth walls, with roofs supported by post and beam networks, became common. [[Cliff-dwelling]]s became common during the [[13th century|13th]] and [[14th century|14th centuries]].\n\n==== Hohokam culture ====\n{{Further|Hohokam culture}}\nHohokam is term borrowed from the [[O'odham language]], used to define an archaeological culture that relied on irrigation canals to water their crops since as early as the [[9th century|9th century CE]]. Their irrigation system techniques allowed for its adherents to expand into the largest population in the Southwest by 1300. Archaeologists working at a major archaeological dig in the 1990s in the [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson Basin]], along the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River,]] identified a culture and people that were ancestors of the Hohokam who might have occupied southern Arizona as early as 2000 BCE. This prehistoric group from the Early Agricultural Period grew corn, lived year-round in sedentary villages, and developed sophisticated irrigation canals from the beginning of the common era to about the middle of the 15th century.\n\nWithin a larger context, the Hohokam culture area inhabited a central trade position between the [[Patayan]] situated along the Lower [[Colorado River]] and in southern California; the [[Trincheras]] of [[Sonora]], Mexico; the [[Mogollon culture]] in eastern Arizona, southwest New Mexico, and northwest [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], Mexico; and the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] in northern Arizona, northern New Mexico, southwest Colorado, and southern [[Utah]].\n\n==== Ancestral Puebloan culture ====\n{{Further|Ancestral Puebloans}}\nThe Ancestral Puebloan culture is known for the stone and earth dwellings its people built along cliff walls, particularly during the [[Pueblo II Era|Pueblo II]] and [[Pueblo III Era|Pueblo III]] eras, from about 900 to 1350 CE in total. The best-preserved examples of the stone dwellings are now protected within United States' [[national parks]], such as [[Navajo National Monument]], [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park]], [[Mesa Verde National Park]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Aztec Ruins National Monument]], [[Bandelier National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], and [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument]].\n\nThese villages were accessible only by rope or through rock climbing. However, the first Ancestral Puebloan homes and villages were based on the pit-house, a common feature in the [[Basketmaker culture|Basketmaker]] periods. Villages consisted of apartment-like complexes and structures made from stone, adobe mud, and other local materials, or were carved into the sides of [[canyon]] walls. Design details from Ancestral Puebloan villages contain elements from cultures as far away as present-day [[Mexico]].\n\nIn their day, these ancient towns and cities were usually multistoried and multipurposed buildings surrounding open [[plaza]]s and [[viewshed]]s. They were occupied by hundreds to thousands of Ancestral Pueblo peoples. These population complexes hosted cultural and civic events and infrastructure that supported a vast outlying region hundreds of miles away linked by transportation roadways.\n\n=== Pueblo architecture and the rise of the Puebloan city state ===\n{{further|Ancient dwellings of Pueblo peoples}}\n[[File:Pueblo Bonito, Chaco Canyon.tif|thumb|Ruins of Pueblo Bonito, in Chaco Canyon|316x316px]]\nBy about 700 to 900 CE, the Puebloans began to move away from ancient pit houses dug in cliffs and to construct connected rectangular rooms arranged in apartment-like structures made of adobe and adapted to sites. By 1050, they had developed planned villages composed of large terraced buildings, each with many rooms. These apartment-house villages were often constructed on defensive sites: on ledges of massive rock, on flat summits, or on steep-sided mesas, locations that would afford the Puebloans protection from raiding parties originating from the north, such as the [[Comanche people|Comanche]] and Navajo. The largest of these villages, [[Pueblo Bonito]] in [[Chaco Canyon]], New Mexico, contained around 700 rooms in five stories; it may have housed as many as 1000 persons.<ref>Nash, Gary B. ''Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America'' Los Angeles (2015). Chapter 1, p. 4 {{ISBN|978-0205887590}}</ref>\n\nPueblo buildings are constructed as complex apartments with numerous rooms, often built in strategic defensive positions. The most highly developed were large villages or pueblos situated at the very top of the [[mesa]]s, the rocky tablelands typical to the Southwest.\n\n=== European contact ===\nBefore 1598, Spanish exploration of the present-day Pueblo areas was limited to an assortment of small groups. A group of colonizers led by [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]] arrived at the end of the 16th Century as part of an apostolic mission to convert the Natives. Despite initial peaceful contact, Spain's attempts to dispose of Pueblo religion and replace it with Catholicism became increasingly more aggressive, and were met with great resistance by Puebloans, whose governmental structure was based around the figure of the [[cacique]], a [[Theocracy|theocratic]] leader for both material and spiritual matters.<ref name=\":2\" />  Over the years, Spaniards' methods grew harsher, leading to a series of revolts by the Puebloans.\n\n==== Pueblo Revolt ====\n{{Main|Pueblo Revolt}}\n[[File:Jemez Pueblo shield, circa 1840.JPG|thumb|Jemez Pueblo shield, circa 1840]]\nThe '''Pueblo Revolt''' that started in 1680 was the first led by a Native American group to successfully expel colonists from North America for a considerable number of years. It followed the successful [[Tiguex War]] led by Tiwas against the [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado|Coronado Expedition]] in 1540\u201341, which temporarily halted Spanish advances in present-day New Mexico. The [[17th Century]]'s revolt was a direct consequence of growing discontent among the Northern Pueblos against the abuses of the Spaniards, which finally brewed into a large organized uprising against European colonizers.\n[[File:PopeUnveiling1.jpg|thumb|upright|Unveiling and dedication of [[Pop\u00e9]] statue by sculptor [[Cliff Fragua]] in the Capitol in Washington DC, September 2005]]\nThe events that led to the Pueblo Revolt go back at least a decade before the formal uprising began. In the 1670s, severe drought swept the region, which caused both a famine among the Pueblo and increased the frequency of raids by the [[Apache]]. Neither Spanish nor Pueblo soldiers were able to prevent the attacks by the Apache raiding parties.\n\nThe unrest among the Pueblos came to a head in 1675, when Governor [[Juan Francisco Trevi\u00f1o]] ordered the arrest of forty-seven Pueblo [[Medicine man|medicine men]] and accused them of practicing [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. Four of the medicine men were sentenced to death by hanging; three of those sentences were carried out, while the fourth prisoner committed suicide. The remaining men were publicly whipped and sentenced to prison.\n\nWhen the news of the killings and public humiliation reached Pueblo leaders, they moved in force to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], where the prisoners were held. Because a large number of Spanish soldiers were away fighting the Apache, Governor Trevi\u00f1o was forced to release the prisoners. Among those released was an [[Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo|Ohkay Owingeh]] Tewa man named [[Pop\u00e9]].\n\nAfter being released, Pop\u00e9 took up residence in [[Taos Pueblo]] far from the capital of Santa Fe and spent the next five years seeking support for a revolt among the 46 Pueblo villages. He was able to gain the support of the Northern [[Tiwa Puebloans|Tiwa]], [[Tewa]], [[Jemez language|Towa]], [[Potou\u2013Tano languages|Tano]], and [[Keresan languages|Keres]]-speaking Pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. The [[Pecos National Historical Park|Pecos]] Pueblo, 50 miles east of the Rio Grande pledged its participation in the revolt as did the [[Zuni people|Zuni]] and [[Hopi]], 120 and 200 miles respectively west of the Rio Grande. At the time, the Spanish population was of about 2,400 colonists, including mixed-blood [[mestizo]]s, and Indian servants and retainers, who were scattered thinly throughout the region.\n\nStarting early on August 10, 1680, Pop\u00e9 and leaders of each of the Pueblos sent a knotted rope carried by a runner to the next Pueblo; the number of knots signified the number of days to wait before beginning the uprising. Finally, on August 21, 2,500 Puebloan warriors took the colony's capital [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] from Spanish control, killing many colonizers, the remainder of whom were successfully expelled.<ref>[[Paul Horgan]] (1954), ''Great River'' vol. 1, p. 286. {{LCCN|549867}}</ref>\n\n===== Legacy and honors =====\n\nOn September 22, 2005, the statue of Po'pay ([[Pop\u00e9]]), the leader of the Pueblo Revolt, was unveiled in the Capitol Rotunda in [[Washington, D.C.]] The statue was the second commissioned by the state of New Mexico for [[National Statuary Hall]]; it was the 100th and last to be added to the collection, which represents the Senate. It was created by [[Cliff Fragua]], a Puebloan from [[Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico]]. It is the only statue in the collection to be created by a Native American.<ref>[http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/09/22/S10371_dedication-of-the-statue-of-popay/ Po'pay dedication]</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Zuni exhibit 1915b.jpg|thumb|A Zuni drying platform for maize and other foods, with two women crafting pottery beneath it. From the [[Panama-California Exposition (1915)|Panama-California Exposition]], San Diego, California.

Indeed, they are now considered the best horticulturists in the country, furnishing most of the fruits and a large portion of the vegetable supplies that are to be found in the markets. They were until very lately the only people in New Mexico who cultivated the grape. They also maintain at the present time considerable herds of cattle, horses, etc. They are, in short, a remarkably sober and industrious race, conspicuous for morality and honesty, and very little given to quarrelling or dissipation ... ''</blockquote>\n\n=== Material culture ===\n[[File:Tribal Council Building, Isleta Pueblo NM.jpg|thumb|[[Tribal Council]] Building at Isleta Pueblo|350x350px]]\n\n==== Clothing ====\nThe Puebloans are traditional weavers of cloth and have used textiles, [[natural fiber]]s and [[Hide (skin)|animal hide]] in their cloth-making. Since woven clothing is laborious and time-consuming, every-day style of dress for working around the villages has been more spare. The men often wore breechcloths.\n\n==== Agriculture ====\n{{Main|Agriculture in the prehistoric Southwest}}\nCorn is the most readily recognizable [[staple food]] for Pueblo peoples. Although it is possible that different groups may have grown local plants such as [[gourd]]s and [[Chenopodium|chenopods]] at very early dates, the first evidence of maize cultivation in the Southwest dates from about 2100 BCE. Small, fairly undomesticated maize cobs have been found at five different sites in New Mexico and Arizona.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Merril|first=William L.|date=2009|title=The Diffusion of Maize to the Southwest United States and its Impact|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=106 (50)|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nMaize reached the present-day Southwest via an unknown route from [[Mexico]] and was rapidly adopted by peoples in the region. One theory states that maize cultivation was carried northward from central Mexico by migrating farmers, most likely speakers of a [[Uto-Aztecan]] language. Another theory, more accepted among scholars, is that maize was diffused northward from group to group rather than migrants. There is evidence that maize was initially cultivated in the Southwest during a [[Climate change (general concept)|climatic period]] when [[precipitation]] was relatively high.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Pottery ====\nThe various Pueblo communities have different traditions regarding the making and decoration of pottery artifacts. Present-day archaeologists date the use of pottery by Puebloans dating back the early centuries of the Common Era.<ref>Mera, H.P., Pueblo Designs: 176 Illustrations of the \"Rain Bird'', Dover Publications, Inc, 1970, first published by the Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe, New Mexico (1937), p. 1''</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"190px\">\nFile:Hopi canteen p1070217.jpg|[[Zuni people|Zuni]] olla, 19th century, at [[Stanford University]] <!-- misnamed object! -->\nFile:SanIldefonsoBowl1.jpg|[[San Ildefonso Pueblo]] Black-on-Black Pottery Bowl by [[Maria Martinez]]\nFile:Zuni figure (UBC-2011).jpg|[[Zuni people|Zuni]] owl figure, [[University of British Columbia]]\nFile:AcomaJar2.jpg|Acoma Pueblo, pottery jar, Field Museum\nFile:TesuqueJar1.jpg|Tesuque Pueblo, Pottery, Field Museum\nFile:BirdEffigyJarCicuye1.jpg|Bird effigy, pottery, [[Cochiti Pueblo]]. Field Museum\n</gallery>\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{further|Hopi mythology}}\n\nIn Native communities of the Southwest's belief system, the [[Archetype|archetypal]] [[Deity|deities]] appear as visionary beings who bring blessings and receive love. A vast collection of religious stories explore the relationships among people and nature, including plants and animals. [[Spider Grandmother]] and [[kachina]] spirits figure prominently in some myths.  [[File:Ohkay Owingeh0.jpg|thumb|right|Dancers at [[Ohkay Owingeh]]|278x278px]]Pueblo prayer included substances as well as words; one common prayer material was ground-up [[maize]]\u2014white [[cornmeal]]. A man might bless his son, or some land, or the town by sprinkling a handful of meal as he uttered a blessing. After the 1692 re-conquest, the Spanish were prevented from entering one town when they were met by a handful of men who uttered imprecations and cast a single pinch of a sacred substance.<ref>Paul Horgan, ''Great River'' p. 158</ref>\n\nThe Pueblo peoples used ritual 'prayer sticks', which were colorfully decorated with beads, fur, and feathers. These prayer sticks (or 'talking sticks') were similar to those used by other Native American nations. By the 13th century, Puebloans used turkey feather blankets for warmth.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news184834568.html \"Turkeys domesticated not once, but twice\"], physorg.com; accessed September 2015.</ref>\n\nMost of the Pueblos hold annual sacred ceremonies, some of which are now open to the public.\n\nReligious ceremonies usually feature traditional dances that are held outdoors in the large common areas and courtyards, which are accompanied by singing and drumming. Unlike kiva ceremonies, traditional dances may be open to non-Puebloans. Traditional dances are considered a form of prayer, and strict rules of conduct apply to those who wish to attend one (e.g. no clapping or walking across the dance area or between the dancers, singers, or drummers).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://santafe.com/article/showing-respect-etiquette-when-attending-native-american-dances-and-feast-d|title=Pueblo religious etiquette|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n[[File:The Kiva at Nambe Pueblo NM.jpg|thumb|Kiva at [[Namb\u00e9 Pueblo, New Mexico|Namb\u00e9 Pueblo]]|294x294px]]\n<blockquote>''Since time immemorial, Pueblo communities have celebrated seasonal cycles through prayer, song, and dance.

Because of the numerous outside tourists who have attended these dances in the pueblos since the late 20th century, such meals are now open to outsiders by personal invitation only. Private sacred ceremonies are conducted inside the [[kiva]]s and only tribal members may participate according to specific rules pertaining to each Pueblo's religion.\n\nThe public observances may also include a Roman Catholic [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] and processions on the Pueblo's feast day. Some Pueblos also hold sacred ceremonies around [[Christmas]] and at other Christian holidays.\n\n==== Catholicism ====\nOne of the primary goals of Spanish colonists in the 17th Century was the desire to bring Christianity to Natives in New Spain. Franciscan priests had prepared for a long process of conversion, building churches and missions all around Pueblo country. Pueblos' feast days are a product of that process. Feast days are held on the day sacred to its [[Roman Catholic]] [[patron saint]], assigned by Spanish missionaries so that each Pueblo's feast day would coincide with one of the people's existing traditional ceremonies. About the imposition of Christianity, [[Alfonso Ortiz]], an Ohkay Owingeh anthropologist and Pueblo specialist states:<blockquote>''The Spanish government demanded labor and tribute from the Pueblos and vigorously attempted to suppress native religion. (...) In that year'' [1692] ''Diego de Vargas re-entered Pueblo territory, though it was not until 1696 that he gained control over the entire Rio Grande Pueblo area. The Spaniards had learned from the Pueblo Revolt and were gentler in their demands in the next century and a half. However, the Pueblos had learned as well and maintained their ceremonial life out of the view of the Spaniards, while adopting a veneer of Roman Catholicism.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the North American Indian - Volume 9 The Southwest|last=Ortiz|first=Alfonso|publisher=|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=4}}</ref></blockquote><br />\n\n== List of Pueblos ==\n=== New Mexico ===\n{{further|List of ancient dwellings of Pueblo peoples in New Mexico}}\n\n* [[Acoma Pueblo]] \u2013 [[Keres language|Keres]] speakers.

They were prevalent throughout the entire southwestern states of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico; and in Texas, Arizona, and California of the United States. The Texas Band are descendants of Mountain Yaqui fighters who fled to Texas in 1870, after having killed Mexican soldiers in the State of Sonora. Many of their descendant families organized as a band with self-government in 2001; they have been recognized as a tribe by a legislative resolution of the state of Texas.<ref>[https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SR989/id/1241168  Resolution SR#989]</ref> all members have documentation of Yaqui ancestry dating to Yaqui Territory of the 1700s.\n* Firecracker pueblo,<ref name=firecracker,pithouses>[https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/firecracker/pithouses.html Texas beyond history: Firecracker pueblo, El Paso County, Texas]</ref> Jornada [[Mogollon culture]], abandoned 2nd half of the fifteenth c., excavated beginning 1980. Illustrates the evolution from pit-houses to a linear array of 15-17 rooms. The walls were coursed adobe; the floors were plastered [[caliche]]. Room 11 had ''[[metate]]s'' and a ''mano'' for grinding corn. (Note that ''metates'' exist in the stone floors of caves of nearby [[Hueco Tanks]] as well.) Located in [[El Paso County, Texas]].\n\n=== Endonyms and exonyms ===\n\nAlthough most present-day pueblos are known by their Spanish or anglicized Spanish name, most Pueblos have a unique name in each of the different languages spoken in the area. The names used by each Pueblo to refer to their village (''endonyms'') usually differs from those given to them by outsiders (their ''exonyms''), including by speakers of other Puebloan languages. Centuries of trade and intermarriages between the groups are reflected in the names given to the same Pueblo in each of the languages. The table below contains the names of the New Mexican pueblos and Hopi using the official or practical orthographies of the languages. Despite not being a Puebloan language, [[Navajo language|Navajo]] names are also included due to prolonged contact between them and the several Pueblos.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English/Spanish Name\n![[Exonym and endonym|Endonym]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=Handbook of the North American Indians |last=Sturtevant |first=William C. |date=1978-2008 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=0160045770 |oclc=13240086}}</ref>\n!Navajo<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Navajo language : a grammar and colloquial dictionary |last=Young |first=Robert W. |date=1980 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |last2=Morgan |first2=William |isbn=0826305369|edition=1st |location=Albuquerque |oclc=6597162}}</ref>\n!Keres<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://keres.co/|title=Keres Language Project|website=Keres Language Project|access-date=November 13, 2018}}</ref>\n!Tewa<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Kiowa-Tanoan: A Synchronic and Diachronic Study|last=Sutton|first=Logan|publisher=University of New Mexico|year=2014|isbn=|location=Albuquerque, NM|pages=}}</ref>\n!Tiwa<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n!Towa<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=A Phonology and morphology of Jemez Towa|last=Yumitani|first=Yukihiro|publisher=University of Kansas Dissertation|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n!Hopi<ref>{{Cite book |title=A concise Hopi and English lexicon |last=Albert |first=Roy |date=1985 |publisher=J.

In [[Australia]], it is usually referred to as a '''wrong'un''', or occasionally as a '''Bosie''' or '''Bosey''', the last two [[eponym]]s in honour of its inventor [[Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)|Bernard Bosanquet]].

The bowler achieves this change of spin by bending the wrist sharply from the normal leg break delivery position. When the [[Cricket ball|ball]] rolls out of the hand (from the side near the [[little finger]], as in a normal leg break), it emerges with clockwise spin (from the bowler's point of view).

This means the ball can either strike the pads for a potential [[leg before wicket]] (lbw) appeal, or may fly between the bat and the pads and hit the [[wicket]], or catch the edge of the bat.\n\nThe googly is a major weapon in the arsenal of a leg spin bowler, and can be one of the bowler's most effective most important wicket-taking balls. It is used infrequently, because its effectiveness comes mostly from its surprise value.\n\n[[Left-arm unorthodox spin]]ners, commonly known as \"[[Left-arm unorthodox spin|chinaman]]\" bowlers, can bowl with the googly action using the left arm. This delivery is usually known as a chinaman googly and turns away from a right-handed batsman, like a leg break or [[left-arm orthodox spin]]ner.
