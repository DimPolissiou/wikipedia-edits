Cho appealed to the public that the school should be a science and technology oriented institute in order for the new school to find its niche and to take advantage of a possible synergetic effect resulting from a collaboration between the researchers and the local industry as seen in the case of [[Stanford University]] and [[Silicon Valley]] or [[KAIST]] and [[Daedeok Science Town|Daedeock Innopolis]].\n\nUNIST was established by the UNIST bill that was passed in 2007 by the request of the people and city of Ulsan. In 2009, UNIST opened its doors to welcome its first class of undergraduate students.\n\nIn March 2015, a new bill was passed in the national assembly recognizing UNIST as one of the four nationally funded research institutes in Korea. Besides changing the Korean name of the school from Ulsan Gwahak Gisurdae (\uc6b8\uc0b0\uacfc\ud559\uae30\uc220\ub300) to Ulsan Gwahak Gisurwon (\uc6b8\uc0b0\uacfc\ud559\uae30\uc220\uc6d0), the passage of this bill implied a new set of additional changes and benefits from the national government including but not limited to a greater emphasis on graduate education and the waiver of the alternative military service examination for its PhD students.\n\nOn 12th of May, 2019, the university has celebrated its 10th anniversary from the day of its opening. The ceremony lasted the entire day, and several UNIST members and distinguished guests, such as [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] members Lee Chae-ik, Jeong Kab-yoon, and Kang Ghil-boo, [[Ulju County]] mayor Lee Seon-ho, among others. The ceremony was sponsored by [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] and BNK Kyongnam Bank.

Modeled after other prestigious universities around the world such as [[KAIST]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology|HKUST]] the school employed three approaches that would set UNIST apart from other universities in Korea. First, despite being a national university of Korea, 100% of the courses at UNIST are taught in English and the school is actively seeking ways to recruit international students and professors. Second, all undergraduate students are required to pursue two areas of specializations called 'tracks'. The first track is roughly equivalent to a major and the second track is comparable to a minor at other universities. Third, UNIST has adopted the [[Flipped classroom|flipped learning]] approach in its classrooms in order to promote active student participation and mastery of the core subjects in science and engineering.\n\nUNIST comprises 12 science and engineering schools, a business school, and the Division of General Studies (DGS) which oversees the school's first year undergraduate curriculum. In addition, there are several specialized graduate schools and research centers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unist.ac.kr/academics/|title=Academics {{!}} UNIST|website=www.unist.ac.kr|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>\n===Undergraduate Schools===\n*School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering\n*School of Urban and Environmental Engineering\n*School of Design and Human Engineering\n*School of Materials Science and Engineering\n*School of Energy and Chemical Engineering\n*School of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n*School of Life Sciences\n*School of Natural Science\n*School of Business Administration\n*School of Management Engineering\n\n===Graduate Schools===\n*Graduate School of Technology & Innovation Management\n*Graduate School of Creative Design Engineering\n*Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Management\n\n\n===Affiliated research centers===\n*[[KOGIC]]: Korean Genomics Center at UNIST\n*Hans Sch\u00f6ler Stem Cell Research Center\n*[[Institute for Basic Science]] (IBS) is a nationally funded research organization in South Korea consisting of a number of labs in universities around the country.

Its location, [[Eonyang]], is adjacent to the old Ulsan city and small mountains surround the whole campus. At the center of the campus, there sits a large man-made pond called Gamakmot, a popular destination for students who seek change of pace in the midst of their studies. The campus is also near the [[Bangudae Petroglyphs]] site which is known for containing the oldest depiction of whaling practices by humans. The campus can be easily accessed from other major cities in South Korea via KTX due to its close proximity to the [[Ulsan Station]].\n\n==Note==\n*All courses are taught in English.\n*Almost all students live in dormitories.\n*All undergraduate students and graduate students in good standing receive full-tuition and living expenses from the university.\n*UNIST is actively recruiting international researchers and graduate level students.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:UNIST Library.jpg|UNIST Library\nFile:\uc6b8\uc0b0\uacfc\ud559\uae30\uc220\uc6d0 \ucea0\ud37c\uc2a41.jpg|Business Administration Building\nFile:UNIST_center_square.jpg|View from the main entrance\nFile:UNIST_campus_2015.jpg|View from the main square to the north\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of national universities in South Korea]]\n*[[List of universities and colleges in South Korea]]\n*[[Education in South Korea|Education in Korea]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|35.573|N|129.190|E|display=title|type:edu_region:KR_dim:1250}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|UNIST}}\n* [[Education in South Korea]]\n* [[List of colleges and universities in South Korea]]\n* [[List of Korea-related topics]]\n\n[[Category:National universities and colleges in South Korea]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Ulsan]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 establishments in South Korea]]\n[[Category:Institute for Basic Science]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=March 2014}}\n{{Redirect|UNIST|the fighting video game|Under Night In-Birth}}\n{{Infobox university\n| name = Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology\n| native_name = \uc6b8\uc0b0\uacfc\ud559\uae30\uc220\uc6d0\n| image_alt = \n| caption = \n| latin_name = \n| motto = First in Change\n| motto_lang = \n| mottoeng = \n| established = {{Start date|2007}}\n| closed = <!-- {{End date|YYYY}} -->\n| type = [[National university|National]]\n| endowment = \n| budget = 152 million USD (2015)\n| rector = \n| officer_in_charge = \n| chairman = \n| chancellor = \n| president = Yong Hoon Lee\n| vice-president = \n| superintendent = \n| provost = \n| vice_chancellor = \n| principal = \n| dean = \n| director = \n| head_label = \n| head = \n| academic_staff = 391<ref name=\"unist2016\">{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=UNIST Facts & Figures |work=UNIST Official Website |publisher=UNIST |url=http://www.unist.ac.kr/about-unist/ |accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref> (2016)\n| administrative_staff = 288<ref name=\"unist2016\"/> (2016)\n| students = \n| undergrad = 4052<ref name=\"unist2016\"/> (2016)\n| postgrad = 1332<ref name=\"unist2016\"/> (2016)\n| doctoral = \n| other = \n| city = [[Ulsan]]\n| state = \n| province = \n| country = [[South Korea]]\n| coor = \n| campus = \n| former_names = \n| free_label = \n| free = \n| athletics = \n| colours = \n| sports = \n| nickname = \n| mascot = Uni(\uc724\uc774) the unicorn\n| affiliation = \n| website = {{URL|http://www.unist.ac.kr}}\n| logo = \n| footnotes = \n| image_name = Latest UNIST logo.jpg\n| image_size = 140px\n| colors = UNIST Navy, UNIST Emerald\n}}\n{{infobox Korean name|\n|hangul = {{linktext|\uc6b8\uc0b0|\uacfc\ud559|\uae30\uc220\uc6d0}}, \uc6b8\uc0b0\uacfc\uae30\uc6d0, \uc720\ub2c8\uc2a4\ud2b8\n|hanja  = {{linktext|\u851a\u5c71|\u79d1\u5b78|\u6280\u8853\u9662}}, \uc6b8\uc0b0\uacfc\uae30\uc6d0, \uc720\ub2c8\uc2a4\ud2b8\n|rr= Ulsan Gwahak Gisurwon\n|mr= Ulsan Kwahak Kisurw\u014fn\n}}\n\n'''Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology''', simply referred to as '''UNIST''' ({{ko-hhrm|\uc6b8\uc0b0\uacfc\ud559\uae30\uc220\uc6d0|\u851a\u5c71\u79d1\u5b78\u6280\u8853\u9662|Ulsan Gwahak Gisurwon|}}), is one of the four public universities in [[South Korea]] which are dedicated to research in science and technology, along with [[KAIST]], [[Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology|GIST]], and [[DGIST]].

Modeled after other prestigious universities around the world such as [[KAIST]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology|HKUST]] the school employed three approaches that would set UNIST apart from other universities in Korea. First, despite being a national university of Korea, 100% of the courses at UNIST are taught in English and the school is actively seeking ways to recruit international students and professors. Second, all undergraduate students are required to pursue two areas of specializations called 'tracks'. The first track is roughly equivalent to a major and the second track is comparable to a minor at other universities. Third, UNIST has adopted the [[Flipped classroom|flipped learning]] approach in its classrooms in order to promote active student participation and mastery of the core subjects in science and engineering.\n\nUNIST comprises 12 science and engineering schools, a business school, and the Division of General Studies (DGS) which oversees the school's first year undergraduate curriculum. In addition, there are several specialized graduate schools and research centers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unist.ac.kr/academics/|title=Academics {{!}} UNIST|website=www.unist.ac.kr|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>\n===Undergraduate Schools===\n*School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering\n*School of Urban and Environmental Engineering\n*School of Design and Human Engineering\n*School of Materials Science and Engineering\n*School of Energy and Chemical Engineering\n*School of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n*School of Life Sciences\n*School of Natural Science\n*School of Business Administration\n*School of Management Engineering\n\n===Graduate Schools===\n*Graduate School of Technology & Innovation Management\n*Graduate School of Creative Design Engineering\n*Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Management\n\n\n===Affiliated research centers===\n*[[KOGIC]]: Korean Genomics Center at UNIST\n*Hans Sch\u00f6ler Stem Cell Research Center\n*[[Institute for Basic Science]] (IBS) is a nationally funded research organization in South Korea consisting of a number of labs in universities around the country.

Its location, [[Eonyang]], is adjacent to the old Ulsan city and small mountains surround the whole campus. At the center of the campus, there sits a large man-made pond called Gamakmot, a popular destination for students who seek change of pace in the midst of their studies. The campus is also near the [[Bangudae Petroglyphs]] site which is known for containing the oldest depiction of whaling practices by humans. The campus can be easily accessed from other major cities in South Korea via KTX due to its close proximity to the [[Ulsan Station]].\n\n==Note==\n*All courses are taught in English.\n*Almost all students live in dormitories.\n*All undergraduate students and graduate students in good standing receive full-tuition and living expenses from the university.\n*UNIST is actively recruiting international researchers and graduate level students.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:UNIST Library.jpg|UNIST Library\nFile:\uc6b8\uc0b0\uacfc\ud559\uae30\uc220\uc6d0 \ucea0\ud37c\uc2a41.jpg|Business Administration Building\nFile:UNIST_center_square.jpg|View from the main entrance\nFile:UNIST_campus_2015.jpg|View from the main square to the north\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of national universities in South Korea]]\n*[[List of universities and colleges in South Korea]]\n*[[Education in South Korea|Education in Korea]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|35.573|N|129.190|E|display=title|type:edu_region:KR_dim:1250}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|UNIST}}\n* [[Education in South Korea]]\n* [[List of colleges and universities in South Korea]]\n* [[List of Korea-related topics]]\n\n[[Category:National universities and colleges in South Korea]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Ulsan]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 establishments in South Korea]]\n[[Category:Institute for Basic Science]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 10th year anniversary \u2192 10th anniversary", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulsan_National_Institute_of_Science_and_Technology"}

By the end of the 1970s, McDonald's restaurants existed in five of the Earth's seven continents; an African location came in 1992 in Casablanca, Morocco.\n\nIn order to cater to local tastes and [[Cuisine|culinary traditions]], and often in respect of particular laws or religious beliefs, McDonald's offers regionalized versions of its [[McDonald's products|menu]] among and within different countries.

USD 12.00) for the burger alone, it is one of the most expensive McDonald's burgers worldwide.\n\n===Ukraine===\nUkraine features the [[McLavash]] sandwich on its menus in the southern part of the country, which is served in flatbread. It has two spicy beef patties, some greens, onion and tomato. The McLavash is also served in some other nearby countries.\n\n===United Kingdom and Ireland===\nBritish and Irish McDonald's serve the Chicken Legend, a chicken breast coated in seasoned batter either spicy tomato salsa, BBQ Sauce or mayonnaise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdonalds.co.uk/content/ukhome/product_nutrition.chicken.243.chicken-legend-with-bacon-cool-mayo.html |title=Product Nutrition |publisher=McDonalds.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> In June 2011, [[Deli Choices]], a line of sandwich rolls with fillings, was released in the UK.

In 2015, McDonald's released a limited edition burger in the Republic of Ireland called the McM\u00f3r. In 2016, this burger was brought back for six weeks. It features Ballymaloe Relish, Charleville cheddar and a potato bun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdonalds.ie/iehome/food/full_menu/beef/mc-mor.html |title=McM\u00f3r burger |publisher=McDonalds.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-04-20}}</ref> In 2016, McDonald's launched the brand new BBQ Smokehouse Range of burgers.

A series of burgers intending to represent various American locales has been released under the ''Great Taste of America'' range.

Not all of these burgers resemble their respective local cuisines.<ref>{{cite news |title=McDonald's Introduces the UK to Incorrect Tastes of America |last=Wheeler |first=Robin |url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/gutcheck/2011/06/mcdonalds_introduces_the_uk_to.php |newspaper=[[The Riverfront Times]] |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527012859/http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/gutcheck/2011/06/mcdonalds_introduces_the_uk_to.php |archive-date=2012-05-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> British and Irish McDonald's also released a series of burgers representing several different countries in the world. These have included Australia, South Africa, Canada and Mexico. Several Summer and Winter menus have been launched. Also, McDonald's has launched several kinds of McFlurrys over the years, such as [[Cornetto (ice cream)|Cornetto]], [[Cadbury]] brands like Dairy Milk (which is available all year around) and the [[Creme Egg]], which is only available around [[Easter]].\n\nIn 2019 McDonald's released a limited-time edition of the Big Mac called the ''Grand Big Mac Bacon'', which is essentially a larger Big Mac with added bacon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Big Mac Bacon|date=2019-01-28|accessdate=2019-01-31|url=https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/product/grand-big-mac-bacon.html}}</ref>\n\nMcDonald's UK also offers a range of premium burgers known as the ''Signature Collection'', consisting of three burgers: ''The Classic'', ''The Spicy'' and ''The BBQ''. Each comes with a thicker patty made from higher quality beef which takes longer to cook and is served on a brioche bun.\n\n==North America==\n===Canada===\n{{Main|McDonald's Canada}}\nFrench fries may be substituted with McDonald's version of [[poutine]]. Previously, McDonald's poutine was available widely only in Francophone Canada (Quebec and parts of New Brunswick) and available elsewhere on a more limited basis; however, in December 2013, McDonald's formally announced the nationwide availability of poutine at all of its Canadian restaurants, due to popular demand.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mcdonald-s-poutine-hitting-menus-across-canada-1.2454323 \"McDonald's poutine hitting menus across Canada\"], CBC News, 06 December 2013.</ref> Quebec also saw the release of the limited-time 1967 Burger, commemorating Canada's first McDonald's franchise. Deli Choices were introduced throughout Canada in 2006. Unique to Canadian McDonald's locations is the McMini, miniature sandwiches with grilled or crispy chicken; flavors include [[Pesto]] Chicken (later replaced by Zesty [[Mango]]) and Spicy Thai.<ref>{{cite web|author=SirJman |url=http://www.travellingmcds.com/2011/11/mcmini-thai-chilli-chicken-and-pesto.html |title=McDonald's Around the World: Chicken McMini Thai Chilli and Pesto \u2013 Lasalle, Canada \u2013 May 2010 |publisher=Travellingmcds.com |date=2011-11-05 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> As in the United States, the McRib periodically appears on the menu for limited runs.  The crispy chicken patty used in the McChicken sandwich sold in Canada uses both white and dark meat \u2013 it is essentially the same size and taste as the original McChicken that first appeared in the US in 1980.\n\nSeasonal items previously available in McDonald's in Canada include the McLobster, a [[lobster roll]], available in the [[Maritime Provinces]], called ''McHomard'' in French.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-biz-mcdonalds-mchomard-canada,0,4348743.photo | work=Chicago Tribune | title=McHomard \u2013 Canada}}</ref> Regionally a blueberry-shortbread McFlurry is also available.  Discontinued items in Canadian McDonald's include pizzas, including a [[calzone]]-style \"McPizza.\"\nThe McFlurry Originated in New Brunswick.\n\n===Mexico===\nMexican McDonald's locations do not serve fish, except during the period of Lent. Special items at these locations have included the Flaming Hot [[Doritos]] Quarter Pounder and the BBQ Double Burger. For breakfast, Mexican McDonald's locations serve the McMollete, which is made on an English muffin spread with beans, topped with a slice of melted cheese and pico de gallo.<ref name=johnson>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-caters-to-local-palettes-2011-1?op=1|accessdate=3 August 2012|title=Check out the awesome meals you can buy at McDonald's around the world|author=Johnson, Robert|date=22 January 2011|work=Business Insider}}</ref> Mexican locations also serve a version of the McSkillet burrito known as the \"McBurrito\".\n\n===United States===\nMcDonald's restaurants in the United States of America offer various types of [[shellfish]] dishes on a regional basis, such as seasonal [[lobster]] rolls in [[New England]] and [[crab cakes]] in the [[Mid-Atlantic states]]. Parts of the [[Upper Midwest]] sell [[Johnsonville Foods|Johnsonville Brats]], a toasted hot dog bun with a Johnsonville [[bratwurst]] topped with spicy mustard and onions. Other regional variations include the [[Texas]] Homestyle Burger, and traditional [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern]] breakfast items, such as a [[country ham]] biscuit and [[biscuits and gravy]].  Locations in the Southwest regularly offer burgers topped with [[New Mexico chile]].\n\nHawaii locations offer [[saimin]] on their regular menu,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tastyislandhawaii.com/2010/06/26/mcdonalds-saimin/ |title=McDonald\u2019s Saimin &#124; The Tasty Island |publisher=Tastyislandhawaii.com |date=2010-06-26 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> and include [[Spam (food)|Spam]], [[lingui\u00e7a|Portuguese sausage]] and [[rice]] as a breakfast option. Pineapple and taro pies, as regularly sold in some Asian countries, have been occasionally offered on the regular menu, along with [[haupia]] pies; pineapple is also sometimes available as a topping on burgers. In [[Waikiki]] locations, small trays of pineapple can be ordered as a side dish. Except for saimin, Hawaiian and selected Asian specialty items can also be found in McDonald's in the US territories of [[Guam]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Mariana Islands]]. During Easter time, Hawaii, Guam and the CNMI all feature the Double Filet-O-Fish meal due to having a heavy concentration of Catholics (mostly people who immigrated from the Philippines) in that region.\n\n====Puerto Rico====\nUnlike Mexico, several Puerto Rican McDonald's restaurants serve fish products, although fish is not listed on McDonald's Puerto Rico's official website. Puerto Rican restaurants also serve the McCriollo (with eggs and cheese) for breakfast. Criollo is a Puerto Rican bread, like a baguette, but bigger and softer. Basically, the McCriollo is a sandwich with ham, cheese, and egg on a Criollo roll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandwichreviews.com/2010/06/mccriollo-puerto-rican-egg-mcmuffin.html |title=It's What's Between: McCriollo: The Puerto Rican Egg McMuffin |publisher=Sandwichreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>\n\n==Oceania==\n===Australia===\nA popular Australian McDonald's menu item is the McOz Burger.

The McOz is a quarter-pounder burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, mustard, ketchup and the so-called Australian ingredients of [[beetroot]] and cooked onion served on a sesame seed bun.\n\nThe El Maco burger, offered in other markets, was released for a limited time offer last on the 27th of November 2019. These burgers launch alongside Mozzarella Sticks served with El Maco Salsa and an El Maco variant Shaker Fries.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|McDonald's New Zealand}}\n[[File:McDonald's Kiwiburger.jpg|thumb|200px|Kiwiburger]]\nMany McDonald's menu items in New Zealand are similar to those in Australia.

Other regional variations include the [[Texas]] Homestyle Burger, and traditional [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern]] breakfast items, such as a [[country ham]] biscuit and [[biscuits and gravy]].  Locations in the Southwest regularly offer burgers topped with [[New Mexico chile]].\n\nHawaii locations offer [[saimin]] on their regular menu,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tastyislandhawaii.com/2010/06/26/mcdonalds-saimin/ |title=McDonald\u2019s Saimin &#124; The Tasty Island |publisher=Tastyislandhawaii.com |date=2010-06-26 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> and include [[Spam (food)|Spam]], [[lingui\u00e7a|Portuguese sausage]] and [[rice]] as a breakfast option.

In [[Waikiki]] locations, small trays of pineapple can be ordered as a side dish. Except for saimin, Hawaiian and selected Asian specialty items can also be found in McDonald's in the US territories of [[Guam]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Mariana Islands]].

Puerto Rican restaurants also serve the McCriollo (with eggs and cheese) for breakfast. Criollo is a Puerto Rican bread, like a baguette, but bigger and softer. Basically, the McCriollo is a sandwich with ham, cheese, and egg on a Criollo roll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandwichreviews.com/2010/06/mccriollo-puerto-rican-egg-mcmuffin.html |title=It's What's Between: McCriollo: The Puerto Rican Egg McMuffin |publisher=Sandwichreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>\n\n==Oceania==\n===Australia===\nA popular Australian McDonald's menu item is the McOz Burger.

Woolworth]] [[retail chain]] became the first customer for Newell's [[bronze]]&ndash;[[plating|plated]] curtain rods in 1916, making them the first Newell products to be distributed nationally. This marked the beginning of Newell's mass merchandising strategy. As the business grew, the company built a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Ogdensburg, New York.\n\nThe company purchased Barnwell Mfg. Co. of Freeport, Illinois in 1921, renaming it Western Newell Manufacturing Company. Freeport's access to railroad lines made it easier to ship products west.

This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of brands. \n\nAccording to the November 10, 2004 ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' documentary series' \"Is Wal-Mart Good for America?\" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and [[fire sale]]-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products, shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality.\n\nDespite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart, citing its strict commitment to its \"everyday low price\" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nHowever, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the \"merger from hell\" by ''[[Bloomberg Business|Businessweek]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-10-19/newell-rubbermaid-why-itll-bounce-back|title=Newell Rubbermaid: Why It'll Bounce Back|date=Oct 19, 2003|accessdate=July 22, 2014|work=Business Week}}</ref> Newell [[shareholder]]s lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell [[Write-off|wrote off]] $500 million in goodwill.\n\n===Other mergers===\nIn 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]]'s stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and [[Liquid Paper]] brands.\n\nIn 2002, they acquired [[Irwin Industrial Tools|American Tool Companies]], adding the Irwin, [[Vise-Grip]], and Marathon brands to their portfolio.\n\nIn 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired [[American Saw and Manufacturing Company]], a manufacturer of linear-edge [[power tool]] accessories, hand tools, and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.\n\nIn 2005, the company acquired [[DYMO Corporation|DYMO]], designing, manufacturing, and marketing on-demand labeling [[solution]]s. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage company Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO.

This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of brands. \n\nAccording to the November 10, 2004 ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' documentary series' \"Is Wal-Mart Good for America?\" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and [[fire sale]]-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products, shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality.\n\nDespite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart, citing its strict commitment to its \"everyday low price\" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nHowever, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the \"merger from hell\" by ''[[Bloomberg Business|Businessweek]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-10-19/newell-rubbermaid-why-itll-bounce-back|title=Newell Rubbermaid: Why It'll Bounce Back|date=Oct 19, 2003|accessdate=July 22, 2014|work=Business Week}}</ref> Newell [[shareholder]]s lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent.

The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage company Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO.

The title of the article is \"A First Class Job\" and the rest of the article follows suit in praising the model, highlighting the car's remarkable performance and beauty. Even with {{convert|415|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of driver and test equipment on board, the car posted a {{convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} acceleration time of 12.2 seconds, 18.8 seconds in the standing start {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} and a top speed of {{convert|105.2|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Fuel economy (over a shorter test distance than usual) was {{cvt|23.8|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}}, which the author suggests would have improved had the usual test distance been completed. The punitive British taxes of the 1960s made this a very expensive car indeed, equivalent in cost to a [[Jaguar Mark X]]. Overall the conclusions of the review were that it was an excellent car.<ref name=Motor1965Coupe>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Unsigned| title = A First Class Job|magazine= [[The Motor]]| volume = |date = 4 December 1965}}</ref>\n\n===404 saloon===\n\n''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' magazine tested the {{cvt|96|hp|PS kW}} fuel injected KF2 version of the 404 saloon/sedan in the spring of 1965. The testers summarized the car as follows: \"100 MPH maximum and high cruising speeds; very well developed fuel injection giving easy starting and moderate fuel consumption; powerful fade-free drum brakes; accurate steering and good compromise suspension; comfortable seating with leather trim; sun-roof a standard fitting; priced rather high in the U.K.\" Mean maximum speed was measured at {{cvt|100|mph|km/h}} with a best leg of {{cvt|101|mph|km/h}}; the standing start {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} was measured at 18.8 seconds.

The testers measured a {{cvt|0|-|60|mph|km/h}} time of 12.1 seconds, with a top speed of {{cvt|98|mph|km/h}}. A good cruising speed is {{cvt|85|mph|km/h}}, according to the article. \"It is difficult to single out any one aspect of the Peugeot as being outstanding, for in truth the whole car is outstanding.\" The writer concludes with: \"To summarize, we can only say that the Peugeot 404 is a car that we find almost impossible to criticize, from any standpoint. It is a car that ideally combines comfort, quality and economy. In short, it is the kind of car one can buy with absolute confidence and drive and drive and drive, for longevity comes with quality in the case of Peugeot.\"\n\nThe 404 saloon was tested by ''[[The Motor|Motor]]'' magazine in 1968. The styling was criticised as square cut, perpendicular and appearing rather dated, while the interior was considered \"austere\" compared to British cars of the time (the article includes a performance comparison with the [[Triumph 2000]], [[Ford Corsair]] 2000E and [[Humber Sceptre]]). However, great praise is given for build quality, with the article stating that the car is suitable for African safaris and Arctic gales alike.<ref name=Motor1968>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Gum-booted refinement Motor Test 10/68|magazine= [[The Motor]]| volume = |date = 9 March 1968}}</ref>\n\n===404 Familiale===\nThe 404 was tested (in Family estate form) by ''Motor'' magazine in 1965. The car's quirks (the unusual original column-shift gearbox gate and awkward body roll at low speed) are listed. Build quality was praised and the interior described as \"quietly tasteful\", although the authors felt that the appeal of the car was limited.<ref name=Motor1965>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Peugeot Family Estate Motor Test 19/65|magazine= [[The Motor]]| volume = |date = 8 May 1965}}</ref>\n\nThe car was tested again by Motor magazine five years later. The article is critical of the car's styling, calling it \"square cut\" and \"hardly avant garde\", but then relents and opts for \"mature rather than dated\" as its final comment. The ride is reported to improve as loading and speed increase. Of some concern to the testers was the driver's difficulty in reaching the handbrake when wearing a fixed seat-belt \u2013 inertia reel type belts would not have this problem. Alternative cars were listed as the [[Citroen DS|Citroen Safari]] and [[Volvo 140 Series|Volvo 145]]. The car is described as having been used by one reader to transport the driver and 12 children.<ref name=Motor1970>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Car comfort, minibus load Motor Test 26/70|magazine= [[The Motor]]| volume = |date = 27 June 1970}}</ref>\n\nAn article in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper on French-made cars includes a comparison of the outgoing 404 with the 504.

The British \"[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]\" magazine tested a Peugeot 404 Diesel in November 1965. The car had a top speed of {{convert|81|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and accelerated from {{convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 25.5 seconds. An \"overall\" fuel consumption of {{cvt|32.2|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded. This compared with a top speed of {{convert|88|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, a {{convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} time of 20 seconds and an overall fuel consumption of {{cvt|32.2|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} for the petrol version of the car which had recently been tested by the same journal and which (albeit without the diesel car's rev limiter) had exactly the same gear ratios. In terms of performance the Peugeot comfortably outperformed the diesel [[Austin Cambridge]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz W110|Mercedes Benz 190D]] also included in the comparison. The slower Austin nonetheless won on fuel economy. In terms of price, the 404 diesel was offered in the UK at \u00a31,396 as against \u00a31,093 for its petrol fuelled sibling.  The manufacturer's recommended price for the Austin was just \u00a3875. The slower heavier Mercedes was not really pitched at the same market segment, being priced in the UK at \u00a32,050. The testers described the Peugeot 404 Diesel as 'the fastest diesel yet'. They reported the characteristic diesel rattle when idling and the 'roar at high revs', but found the performance 'very reasonable'. They commended the sure-footed road holding, good steering, powerful fade-free brakes, the comfortable seats, the very good fuel economy and the prospect for a 'long attention-free life'.<ref name=Autocar1965diesel>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Autotest \u2013 Peugeot 404 Diesel|magazine=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = | pages =1133\u20131137 |date = 26 November 1965}}</ref>\n\nThe 404 Diesel was tested again (in Family estate form) by Autocar magazine six years later. Top speed was improved on the previous test, {{convert|82|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, but acceleration to {{cvt|60|mph|km/h}} was poorer at 26.8 seconds.

A truck body style variant was marketed until 1988. The 404 was manufactured under licence in various African countries until 1991 (in Kenya) and was manufactured in [[Argentina]] by Safrar/[[Sevel Argentina S.A.|Sevel]] in El Palomar, in Qu\u00e9bec, [[Canada]] at the St-Bruno-de-Montarville SOMA Ltd. plant and in [[Chile]] by Automotores Franco Chilena S.A. in [[Los Andes, Chile|Los Andes]].<ref name=WC72>{{Cite book |title=World Cars 1972 |ref=WC72 |publisher=L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books |location=Bronxville, NY |page=402 |year=1972 |isbn=0-910714-04-5}}</ref>\n\nStyled by [[Pininfarina]], the 404 was offered initially as a [[sedan (car)|saloon]], [[estate (car)|estate]], and [[Pickup truck|pickup]]. A [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was added in 1962, and a [[coup\u00e9]] in 1963. The 404 was fitted with a 1.6 litre [[petrol engine]], with either a [[Solex]] [[carburetor]] or [[Kugelfischer]] mechanical [[fuel injection]] or a 1.9 litre [[diesel engine]] available as options. Introduced at the [[Paris Motor Show]] as an option was the inclusion of a 3-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[automatic transmission]], similar to the unit already offered on certain [[BMW]] models,<ref name=Car196512>{{cite magazine |authorlink=Ian Fraser (Ed) |title=Behind the glitter of Paris: Show Report|magazine=Car Magazine |volume = |pages=27\u201330 |date=December 1965}}</ref> as an alternative to the standard column-mounted manual unit.\n\nPopular as a [[taxicab]], the 404 enjoyed a reputation for durability and value.

The testers measured a {{cvt|0|-|60|mph|km/h}} time of 12.1 seconds, with a top speed of {{cvt|98|mph|km/h}}. A good cruising speed is {{cvt|85|mph|km/h}}, according to the article. \"It is difficult to single out any one aspect of the Peugeot as being outstanding, for in truth the whole car is outstanding.\" The writer concludes with: \"To summarize, we can only say that the Peugeot 404 is a car that we find almost impossible to criticize, from any standpoint. It is a car that ideally combines comfort, quality and economy. In short, it is the kind of car one can buy with absolute confidence and drive and drive and drive, for longevity comes with quality in the case of Peugeot.\"\n\nThe 404 saloon was tested by ''[[The Motor|Motor]]'' magazine in 1968. The styling was criticised as square cut, perpendicular and appearing rather dated, while the interior was considered \"austere\" compared to British cars of the time (the article includes a performance comparison with the [[Triumph 2000]], [[Ford Corsair]] 2000E and [[Humber Sceptre]]). However, great praise is given for build quality, with the article stating that the car is suitable for African safaris and Arctic gales alike.<ref name=Motor1968>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Gum-booted refinement Motor Test 10/68|magazine= [[The Motor]]| volume = |date = 9 March 1968}}</ref>\n\n===404 Familiale===\nThe 404 was tested (in Family estate form) by ''Motor'' magazine in 1965. The car's quirks (the unusual original column-shift gearbox gate and awkward body roll at low speed) are listed. Build quality was praised and the interior described as \"quietly tasteful\", although the authors felt that the appeal of the car was limited.<ref name=Motor1965>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Peugeot Family Estate Motor Test 19/65|magazine= [[The Motor]]| volume = |date = 8 May 1965}}</ref>\n\nThe car was tested again by Motor magazine five years later. The article is critical of the car's styling, calling it \"square cut\" and \"hardly avant garde\", but then relents and opts for \"mature rather than dated\" as its final comment. The ride is reported to improve as loading and speed increase. Of some concern to the testers was the driver's difficulty in reaching the handbrake when wearing a fixed seat-belt \u2013 inertia reel type belts would not have this problem. Alternative cars were listed as the [[Citroen DS|Citroen Safari]] and [[Volvo 140 Series|Volvo 145]]. The car is described as having been used by one reader to transport the driver and 12 children.<ref name=Motor1970>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Car comfort, minibus load Motor Test 26/70|magazine= [[The Motor]]| volume = |date = 27 June 1970}}</ref>\n\nAn article in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper on French-made cars includes a comparison of the outgoing 404 with the 504. The performance of both cars (given their engine size) is praised.<ref name=TheTimes1973>{{cite news| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Built to do the donkey work|newspaper= [[The Times]]| volume = | pages = Supplement, page III|date = 13 March 1973}}</ref>\n\n===404 Diesel===\nDuring the 1960s Peugeot, along with [[Mercedes-Benz]], were pioneering large scale production of diesel engined passenger cars. The British \"[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]\" magazine tested a Peugeot 404 Diesel in November 1965. The car had a top speed of {{convert|81|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and accelerated from {{convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 25.5 seconds. An \"overall\" fuel consumption of {{cvt|32.2|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded. This compared with a top speed of {{convert|88|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, a {{convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} time of 20 seconds and an overall fuel consumption of {{cvt|32.2|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} for the petrol version of the car which had recently been tested by the same journal and which (albeit without the diesel car's rev limiter) had exactly the same gear ratios. In terms of performance the Peugeot comfortably outperformed the diesel [[Austin Cambridge]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz W110|Mercedes Benz 190D]] also included in the comparison. The slower Austin nonetheless won on fuel economy. In terms of price, the 404 diesel was offered in the UK at \u00a31,396 as against \u00a31,093 for its petrol fuelled sibling.  The manufacturer's recommended price for the Austin was just \u00a3875. The slower heavier Mercedes was not really pitched at the same market segment, being priced in the UK at \u00a32,050. The testers described the Peugeot 404 Diesel as 'the fastest diesel yet'. They reported the characteristic diesel rattle when idling and the 'roar at high revs', but found the performance 'very reasonable'. They commended the sure-footed road holding, good steering, powerful fade-free brakes, the comfortable seats, the very good fuel economy and the prospect for a 'long attention-free life'.<ref name=Autocar1965diesel>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Autotest \u2013 Peugeot 404 Diesel|magazine=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = | pages =1133\u20131137 |date = 26 November 1965}}</ref>\n\nThe 404 Diesel was tested again (in Family estate form) by Autocar magazine six years later. Top speed was improved on the previous test, {{convert|82|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, but acceleration to {{cvt|60|mph|km/h}} was poorer at 26.8 seconds. Notable features in the report were that the test car had broken two speedometer cables during testing. They mention its size twice: \"wonderfully roomy\" and \"a big car for big men\". The cars \"oddities\" are listed as the reverse-acting gearbox gate, window-sill door locks and windscreen wiper controls.<ref name=Autocar1971>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Brief Test Peugeot 404 Family Estate (diesel)|magazine=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = | pages = 16\u201317|date = 8 July 1971}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Peugeot 404 Berlin.JPG|Peugeot 404 diesel record car 1965\nFile:Argentine Peugeot 404 U pick-up.jpg|Argentine Peugeot 404 pickup (1973-1979)\n</gallery>\n\n==Motorsport==\nPeugeot 404s won the [[Safari Rally]] in 1963, 1966, 1967 and 1968, the latter three in Kugelfischer fuel-injected variants.
