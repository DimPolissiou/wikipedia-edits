Some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging (i.e., continued charging after the battery has been fully charged) and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source, depending on battery type. Simple chargers of this type must be manually disconnected at the end of the charge cycle, and some battery types absolutely require, or may use a timer, to cut off charging current at some fixed time, approximately when charging is complete. Other battery types cannot withstand over-charging, being damaged (reduced capacity, reduced lifetime), over heating or even exploding. \nThe charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to safely adjust the charging current and voltage, determine the [[state of charge]], and cut off at the end of charge.\n\nA trickle charger provides a relatively small amount of current, only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time. Some battery types cannot tolerate trickle charging of any kind;  attempts to do so may result in damage.  Lithium ion battery cells use a chemistry system which does not permit indefinite trickle charging.<ref>Phil Weicker, ''A Systems Approach to Lithium-Ion Battery Management'',Artech House, 2013 {{ISBN|1608076598}} page 26 </ref>\n\nSlow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge. High-rate chargers may restore most capacity much faster, but high rate chargers can be more than some battery types can tolerate. Such batteries require active monitoring of the battery to protect it from overcharging. Electric vehicles ideally need high-rate chargers. For public access, installation of such chargers and the distribution support for them is an issue in the proposed adoption of electric cars.\n\n==C-rate==\n{{see also|Battery (electricity)#C rate}}\nCharge and discharge rates are often given as ''C'' or ''C-rate'', which is a measure of the rate at which a battery is charged or discharged relative to its capacity. The C-rate is defined as the charge or discharge current divided by the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge. While rarely stated explicitly, the unit of the C-rate is [[hour|h]]<sup>\u22121</sup>, equivalent to stating the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge in unit hour times current in the same unit as the charge or discharge current. The C-rate is never negative, so whether it describes a charging or discharging process depends on the context.\n\nFor example, for a battery with a capacity of 500&nbsp;mAh, a discharge rate of 5000&nbsp;mA (i.e., 5&nbsp;A) corresponds to a C-rate of 10 (per hour), meaning that such a current can discharge 10 such batteries in one hour. Likewise, for the same battery a charge current of 250&nbsp;mA corresponds to a C-rate of 1/2 (per hour), meaning that this current will increase the state of charge of this battery by 50% in one hour.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary_battery_specifications.pdf |format= [[PDF]] |title= A Guide to Understanding Battery Specifications MIT Electric Vehicle Team  |website= [[mit.edu|web.mit.edu]] |date= December 2008 |accessdate= May 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince the unit of the C-rate is typically implied, some care is required when using it to avoid confusing it with the battery's capacity to store a charge, which in the [[International System of Units|SI]] has unit [[coulomb]] with unit symbol ''C''.\n\nIf both the (dis)charge current and the battery capacity in the C-rate ratio is multiplied by the battery voltage, the C-rate becomes a ratio of the (dis)charge power to the battery's energy capacity. For example, when the 100&nbsp;kWh battery in a [[Tesla Model S]] P100D is undergoing [[Tesla supercharger|supercharging]] at 120&nbsp;kW the C-rate is 1.2 (per hour) and when that battery delivers its maximum power of 451&nbsp;kW, its C-rate is 4.51 (per hour).\n\nAll charging and discharging of batteries generates internal heat, and the amount of heat generated is roughly proportional to the current involved (a battery's current state of charge, condition / history, etc. are also factors).  As some batteries reach their full charge, cooling may also be observed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/snva557/snva557.pdf| format=[[PDF]] |title=LM2576,LM3420,LP2951,LP2952 Battery Charging |website= [[ti.com|www.ti.com]] [date=July 2018 |accessdate= July 29, 2018}}</ref> Battery cells which have been built to allow higher C-rates than usual must make provision for increased heating. But high C-ratings are attractive to end users because such batteries can be charged more quickly, and produce higher current output in use.  High C-rates typically require the charger to carefully monitor battery parameters such as terminal voltage and temperature to prevent overcharging and so damage to the cells. Such high charging rates are possible only with some battery types. Others will be damaged or possibly overheat or catch fire. Some batteries may even explode. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} For example, an automobile SLI (starting, lighting, ignition) lead-acid battery carries [[Lead\u2013acid battery#Risk of explosion|several risks of explosion]].\n\n==Type==\n\n===Simple charger===\n\nA simple charger works by supplying a [[direct current|constant DC]] or [[pulsed DC]] [[electric power|power]] source to a battery being charged. A simple charger typically does not alter its output based on charging time or the charge on the battery. This simplicity means that a simple charger is inexpensive, but there are tradeoffs. Typically, a carefully designed simple charger takes longer to charge a battery because it is set to use a lower (i.e., safer) charging rate. Even so, many batteries left on a simple charger for too long will be weakened or destroyed due to over-charging. These chargers also vary in that they can supply either a constant voltage or a constant current, to the battery.\n\nSimple AC-powered battery chargers usually have much higher [[ripple (electrical)|ripple current and ripple voltage]] than other kinds of battery chargers because they are inexpensively designed and built.  Generally, when the ripple current is within a battery's manufacturer recommended level, the ripple voltage will also be well within the recommended level.  The maximum ripple current for a typical 12{{nbsp}}V 100{{nbsp}}Ah [[VRLA battery]] is 5 amps. As long as the ripple current is not excessive (more than 3 to 4 times the battery manufacturer recommended level), the expected life of a ripple-charged VRLA battery will be within 3% of the life of a constant DC-charged battery.<ref>\n[http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Brands/Liebert/Documents/White%20Papers/Effects%20of%20AC%20Ripple%20Current%20on%20VRLA%20Battery%20Life.pdf \"Effects of AC Ripple Current on VRLA Battery Life\"]\nby Emerson Network Power\n</ref>\n\n===Fast charger===\nFast chargers make use of control circuitry to rapidly charge the batteries without damaging any of the cells in the battery. The control circuitry can be built into the battery (generally for each cell) or in the external charging unit, or split between both. Most such chargers have a [[cooling fan]] to help keep the temperature of the cells at safe levels. Most fast chargers are also capable of acting as standard overnight chargers if used with standard NiMH cells that do not have the special control circuitry.\n\n===Three stage charger===\nTo accelerate the charging time and provide continuous charging, an intelligent charger attempts to detect the state of charge and condition of the battery and applies a 3-stage charging scheme. The following description assumes a sealed lead acid traction battery at 25{{nbsp}}\u00b0C. The first stage is referred to as \"bulk absorption\";  the charging current will be held high and constant and is limited by the capacity of the charger. When the voltage on the battery reaches its outgassing voltage (2.22 volts per cell) the charger switches to the second stage and the voltage is held constant (2.40 volts per cell). The delivered current will decline at the maintained voltage, and when the current reaches less than 0.005C the charger enters its third stage and the charger output will be held constant at 2.25 volts per cell. In the third stage, the charging current is very small 0.005C and at this voltage the battery can be maintained at full charge and compensate for self-discharge.\n\n===Induction-powered charger===\n{{Main|Inductive charging}}\n\nInductive battery chargers use [[electromagnetic induction]] to charge batteries. A charging station sends electromagnetic energy through [[inductive coupling]] to an electrical device, which stores the energy in the batteries. This is achieved without the need for metal contacts between the charger and the battery. Inductive battery chargers are commonly used in [[electric toothbrush]]es and other devices used in bathrooms. Because there are no open electrical contacts, there is no risk of electrocution. Nowadays it is being used to charge wireless phones.\n\n===Intelligent charger===\n[[Image:Ladeger\u00e4t.jpg|thumb|right| Example of a smart charger for AA and AAA batteries]]\nA \"smart charger\" should not be confused with a \"smart battery\". A [[smart battery]] is generally defined as one containing some sort of electronic device or \"chip\" that can communicate with a [[smart charger]] about battery characteristics and condition.  A smart battery generally requires a smart charger it can communicate with (see [[Smart Battery Data]]).  A smart charger is defined as a charger that can respond to the condition of a battery, and modify its charging actions accordingly.\n\nSome smart chargers are designed to charge:\n* \"smart\" batteries with internal protection or supervision or management circuitry.\n* \"dumb\" batteries, which lack any internal electronic circuitry.\n\nThe output current of a smart charger depends upon the battery's state. An intelligent charger may monitor the battery's voltage, temperature or time under charge to determine the optimum charge current and to terminate charging.\n\nFor [[nickel-cadmium battery|Ni-Cd]] and [[NiMH]] batteries, the voltage across the battery increases slowly during the charging process, until the battery is fully charged. After that, the voltage ''decreases'', which indicates to an intelligent charger that the battery is fully charged. Such chargers are often labeled as a \u0394V, \"delta-V,\" or sometimes \"delta peak\", charger, indicating that they monitor the voltage change.\n\nThe problem is, the magnitude of \"delta-V\" can become very small or even non-existent if (very) high{{Quantify|date=October 2010}} capacity rechargeable batteries are recharged.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This can cause even an intelligent battery charger to not sense that the batteries are actually already fully charged, and to continue charging. Overcharging of the batteries will result in some cases. However, many so called intelligent chargers employ a combination of cut off systems, which are intended to prevent overcharging in the vast majority of cases.\n\nA typical intelligent charger fast-charges a battery up to about 85% of its maximum capacity in less than an hour, then switches to trickle charging, which takes several hours to top off the battery to its full capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaging-resource.com/ACCS/BATTS/BATTS.HTM |title=The Great Battery Shootout |author=Dave Etchells}}</ref>\n\n===Motion-powered charger===\n[[Image: Linear induction flashlight.jpg|thumb|300px|Linear induction flashlight, charged by shaking along its long axis, causing magnet ''(visible at right)'' to slide through a coil of wire ''(center)'' to generate electricity]]\nSeveral companies have begun making devices that charge batteries based on human motions.  One example, made by [[Tremont Electric]], consists of a magnet held between two springs that can charge a battery as the device is moved up and down, such as when walking.  Such products have not yet achieved significant commercial success.<ref>Martin LaMonica, CNET. \"[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20076064-54/motion-powered-gadget-charger-back-on-track/?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20 Motion-powered gadget charger back on track].\" Jul 1, 2011.

The DC pulses have a strictly controlled [[rise time]], pulse width, pulse repetition rate ([[frequency]]) and [[amplitude]]. This technology is said to work with any size, voltage, capacity or chemistry of batteries, including automotive and [[VRLA|valve-regulated]] batteries.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/913/ |title=AN913: Switch-Mode, Linear, and Pulse Charging Techniques for Li+ Battery in Mobile Phones and PDAs |publisher=Maxim |year=2001}}\n</ref>\n\nWith pulse charging, high instantaneous voltages can be applied without overheating the battery.  In a [[Lead\u2013acid battery]], this breaks down lead-sulfate crystals, thus greatly extending the battery service life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallas.net/~jvpoll/Battery/aaPictures.html  |title=Lead\u2013acid battery sulfation |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070402140958/http://www.dallas.net/~jvpoll/Battery/aaPictures.html |archivedate = 2007-04-02}}</ref>\n\nSeveral kinds of pulse charging are patented.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2003088447 |title=\"fast pulse battery charger\" patent |year=2003}}\n</ref><ref>\n\"Battery charger with current pulse regulation\"\npatented 1981\nUnited States Patent 4355275\n</ref><ref>\n\"Pulse-charge battery charger\"\npatented 1997\nUnited States Patent 5633574\n</ref>  Others are [[open source hardware]].\n\nSome chargers use pulses to check the current battery state when the charger is first connected, then use constant current charging during fast charging, then use pulse charging as a kind of trickle charging to maintain the charge.<ref>[http://928uk.com/battery-conditioners.htm \"Pulse Maintenance charging.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309020550/http://928uk.com/battery-conditioners.htm |date=March 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSome chargers use \"negative pulse charging\", also called \"reflex charging\" or \"burp charging\".\nSuch chargers use both positive and brief negative current pulses.  There is no significant evidence, however, that negative pulse charging is more effective than ordinary pulse charging.\n\n===Solar charger===\n{{main|Solar charger}}\n{{Further|Energy harvesting}}\n[[File:Solar-Charger Varta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Varta]] Solar Charger Model 57082 with two 2100{{nbsp}}mAh Ni-MH rechargeable batteries]]\nSolar chargers convert light energy into low voltage [[DC current]]. They are generally [[wikt:portable|portable]], but can also be fixed mount.  Fixed mount solar chargers are also known as [[solar panels]]. Solar panels are often connected to the electrical grid via control and interface circuits, whereas portable solar chargers are used off-the-grid (i.e. [[Automobile|cars]], [[boats]], or [[RVs]]).\n\nAlthough portable solar chargers obtain energy from the sun only, they still can (depending on the technology) be used in low light (i.e. cloudy) applications.  Portable solar chargers are often used for [[trickle charging]], although some solar chargers (depending on the [[wattage]]), can completely recharge batteries. Other devices may exist, which combine this with other sources of energy for added recharging efficacy.\n\n===Timer-based charger===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe output of a [[timer]] charger is terminated after a pre-determined time. Timer chargers were the most common type for high-capacity [[Ni-Cd]] cells in the late 1990s for example (low-capacity consumer Ni-Cd cells were typically charged with a simple charger).\n\nOften a timer charger and set of batteries could be bought as a bundle and the charger time was set to suit those batteries. If batteries of lower capacity were charged then they would be overcharged, and if batteries of higher capacity were charged they would be only partly charged. With the trend for battery technology to increase capacity year on year, an old timer charger would only partly charge the newer batteries.\n\nTimer based chargers also had the drawback that charging batteries that were not fully discharged, even if those batteries were of the correct capacity for the particular timed charger, would result in over-charging.\n\n===Trickle charger===\n{{Main|Trickle charging}}\n\nA trickle charger is typically a low-current (usually between 5\u20131,500&nbsp;mA) battery charger or one which has a trickle charging operating mode. A trickle charger is generally used to charge small capacity batteries (2\u201330&nbsp;Ah). These types of battery chargers are also used to maintain larger capacity batteries (> 30&nbsp;Ah) that are typically found on cars, boats, RVs and other related vehicles. In larger applications, the current of the battery charger is sufficient only to provide a maintenance or trickle current (trickle is commonly the last charging stage of most battery chargers).  Depending on the technology of the trickle charger, it can be left connected to the battery indefinitely. Some battery chargers that can be left connected to the battery without causing the battery damage are also referred to as smart or intelligent chargers.  Some battery types are not suitable for trickle charging. For instance, most Li-ion batteries cannot be safely trickle charged, and the damage caused can be enough to cause a fire or even an explosion.\n\n===Universal battery charger\u2013analyzer===\nThe most sophisticated types are used in critical applications (e.g. military or aviation batteries).  These heavy-duty automatic \u201cintelligent charging\u201d systems can be programmed with complex charging cycles specified by the battery maker.  The best are universal (i.e. can charge all battery types), and include automatic capacity testing and analyzing functions too.\n\n===USB-based charger===\n{{Off topic||Off topic|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[File: Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket.jpg|thumb|Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket]]\n{{See also|USB#Power|ISO 4165}}\nSince the [[Universal Serial Bus]] specification provides for a five-volt power supply (with limited maximum power), it is possible to use a [[USB cable]] to connect a device to a power supply. Products based on this approach include chargers for [[cellular phone]]s, portable [[digital audio players]], and [[tablet computer]]s. They may be fully compliant USB peripheral devices adhering to USB power discipline, or uncontrolled in the manner of [[USB decoration]]s.\n\n====Power bank====\n\n[[Image:USB power bank.jpg|thumb|right|A power bank with USB cable.]]\n\nA power bank is a portable device that can supply power from its built-in battery through a USB port.  Power banks are popular for charging USB charged devices. They can also be used as a power supply for various USB powered devices such as lights and small fans. They usually recharge with a [[USB|USB power supply]].  The power bank includes a control circuit that both regulates charging of the battery and converts the battery voltage to 5.0 volts for the USB port. Some chargers for cells like 18650s and 26650 can also serve as a power bank.  Although it is generally more cumbersome to carry such a charger with cells rather than a conventional power bank, this arrangement can also charge cells for other uses, and swap cells that are dead.  It also has the advantage that, when the cells are dead, they can be swapped for fresh cells for immediate use rather than having to be recharged first. [https://tecgyan.in/best-power-banks/ Fast Charging power banks] are best these days.\n[[Image:Quintezz powerbank, opened.png|thumb|right|Many powerbanks use the common 18650 size [[lithium-ion battery]] which may be user-replaceable.]]\n\nSpecifications:\n* Capacity in Wh: Total power capacity measured by multiplying mAh by voltage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.powerbanktalk.com/best-power-banks/ |title=The Best USB Battery Packs}}</ref>\n* Capacity in mAh: [[mAh]] stands for milli Ampere-hour and measures the amount of power flow that can be supplied by a certain power bank at a specific voltage. Many manufacturers rate their products at 3.7 V, the voltage of cell(s) inside. Since USB outputs at 5 V, calculations at this voltage will yield a lower mAh number. For example, a battery pack advertised with a 3000 mAh capacity (at 3.7 V) will produce 2220 mAh at 5 V.  Power losses due to efficiency of the charging circuitry also occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/portable-power-bank-capacities-gary-explains-699550/ |title=Does a 3000 mAh portable power bank charge a 3000 mAh phone? |publisher=Android Authority |date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>\n* Simultaneous charging and discharging (also known as ''\u201cpassthrough\u201d charging''<ref name=RAV_passthrough2>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2018/06/pass-through-creative-ways-power-banks-charge/ RavPower.com blog article: \u201cHow Pass Through Charging Lets You Use Power Banks In Creative Ways\u201d]</ref><ref name=RAV_passthrough>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2017/10/danger-and-damage-of-pass-through-technology-for-batteries/ RAVpower Blog article: \u201cWhat is Passthrough Charging?\u201d]</ref>): need to specify if the powerbank's ports can output power while it being charged itself.\n* Number of output [[USB]] ports: This specifies the number of devices that can be charged simultaneously.\n* Output current rating: This specifies the current rating that it can charge maximum. The higher the number, the better the powerbank. This can vary from output port to output port. Also, some powerbanks don't have dedicated high current ports, but will drop the output at all ports if the maximum total current output of the powerbank is exceeded.\n* Input Current Rating: Input current rating is the amount of current the powerbank is able to draw at its maximum level while getting charged.\n* Safety Protections: Over Voltage Protection, Over Charge Protection, Over Current Protection, Over Heat Protection, Short-Circuit Protections and Over Discharge Protections are the common safety measures observed with standard powerbanks.\n* [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] Indications: The Led glows as per indicating the amount of charging ability left with the powerbank. Some powerbanks have a line of LEDs, with the number of LEDs lit indicating state of charge. Other powerbanks may simply have one LED which changes color or flashes when the charge of the internal battery is low.\n* [[Quick charge]] (commonly [[Qualcomm Quick Charge]]) support?\n\nSome power banks have a built-in wireless charging pad. Power banks are available in different capacity ratings.\n\n====Compatibility====\n[[File:Mini, micro and J10 USB connectors.jpg|thumb|Mini, micro and J10 USB charging connectors]]\n[[File:Lightning connector.svg|thumb|Lightning connector]]\n[[File:USB charger with three different charging ports.png|thumb|Australian 240 V USB charger with three different types of charging ports]]\nAlthough a standard exists for USB chargers<ref>{{cite web |title=IEC - Newslog > 2011-02-01: One size-fits-all mobile phone charger: IEC publishes first globally relevant standard |url=http://www.iec.ch/newslog/2011/nr0311.htm |website=www.iec.ch |accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref>, there are two areas of common incompatibility.\n* The connector on the device to be charged.

It is essential that the connectors on the device and charger match exactly, so that the correct polarity is used.  Reversing the polarity between a battery and its charger is likely to cause battery failure and even charger failure.  The failures may result in fire or damaged / destroyed equipment..\n* The charging port. This may be smart or dumb, and each in various current ratings. Compatibility varies and must be checked to maximize safety . A mismatched charger will charge more slowly, and sometimes not at all.\n\n==Applications==\nSince a battery charger is intended to be connected to a battery, it may not have voltage regulation or filtering of the DC voltage output;  it is cheaper to make them that way. Battery chargers equipped with both voltage regulation and filtering are sometimes termed [[battery eliminator]]s.\n\n===Battery charger for vehicles===\nThere are two main types of chargers used for vehicles:\n* To recharge a fuel vehicle's [[Car battery|starter battery]], where a modular charger is used; typically an [[IUoU battery charging|3-stage charger]].\n* To recharge an electric vehicle (EV) battery pack; see [[Charging station]].\n\nChargers for car batteries come in varying ratings. Chargers that are rated up to two amperes may be used to maintain charge on parked vehicle batteries or for small batteries on garden tractors or similar equipment. A motorist may keep a charger rated a few amperes to ten or fifteen amperes for maintenance of automobile batteries or to recharge a vehicle battery that has accidentally discharged. Service stations and commercial garages will have a large charger to fully charge a battery in an hour or two; often these chargers can briefly source the hundreds of amperes required to crank an internal combustion engine starter.\n\n=== Electric vehicle batteries===\n\nElectric vehicle battery chargers (ECS) come in a variety of brands and characteristics. These chargers vary from 1&nbsp;kW to 7.5&nbsp;kW maximum charge rate. Some use algorithm charge curves, others use constant voltage, constant current. Some are programmable by the end user through a [[Controller area network|CAN]] port, some have dials for maximum voltage and amperage, some are preset to specified battery pack voltage, amp-hour and chemistry. Prices range from $400 to $4500.\n\nA 10 amp-hour battery could take 15 hours to reach a fully charged state from a fully discharged condition with a 1 amp charger as it would require roughly 1.5 times the battery's capacity.\n\nPublic EV [[charging station]]s provide 6&nbsp;kW (host power of 208 to 240 VAC off a 40 amp circuit). 6&nbsp;kW will recharge an EV roughly 6 times faster than 1&nbsp;kW overnight charging.\n\nRapid charging results in even faster recharge times and is limited only by available AC power, battery type, and the type of charging system.<ref>[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/09/fuji-heavy-spee.html Fuji Heavy Speeds Up Recharging of R1e EV].

These typically employ some form of inductive connection between the grid and a charging vehicle. Some isolated chargers may be used in parallel. This allows for an increased charge current and reduced charging times. The battery has a maximum current rating that cannot be exceeded\n* Non-isolated: the battery charger has a direct electrical connection to the A/C outlet's wiring. Non-isolated chargers cannot be used in parallel.\n\n[[Power Factor Correction]] (PFC) chargers can more closely approach the maximum current the plug can deliver, shortening charging time.\n\n====Charge stations====\n{{Main|Charging station}}\n\n[[Better Place (company)|Project Better Place]] was deploying a network of charging stations and subsidizing vehicle battery costs through [[leasing|leases]] and credits until filing for bankruptcy in May 2013.\n[[File:Charge6 3wACin.jpg|thumb|Auxiliary charger designed to fit a variety of proprietary devices]]\n\n====Induction-powered charging====\nResearchers at the [[Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] (KAIST) have developed an electric transport system (called [[Online Electric Vehicle]], OLEV)  where the vehicles get their power needs from cables underneath the surface of the road via [[inductive charging]], (where a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself.<ref>[http://www.gizmag.com/kaist-olev-electric-vehicle/12557/ Korean electric vehicle solution].

It can charge mobile phone 4 times faster than standard micro USB.\n\n===Stationary battery plants===\nTelecommunications, electric power, and computer [[uninterruptible power supply]] facilities may have very large standby battery banks (installed in [[battery room]]s) to maintain critical loads for several hours during interruptions of primary grid power. Such chargers are permanently installed and equipped with temperature compensation, supervisory alarms for various system faults, and often redundant independent power supplies and redundant rectifier systems. Chargers for stationary battery plants may have adequate voltage regulation and filtration and sufficient current capacity to allow the battery to be disconnected for maintenance, while the charger supplies the DC system load. Capacity of the charger is specified to maintain the system load and recharge a completely discharged battery within, say, 8 hours or other interval.\n\n===Use in experiments===\nA battery charger can work as a DC [[power adapter]] for experimentation. It may, however, require an external [[capacitor]] to be connected across its output terminals in order to \"smooth\" the voltage sufficiently, which may be thought of as a DC voltage plus a \"[[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]]\" voltage added to it.  There may be an [[internal resistance]] connected to limit the short circuit current, and the value of that internal resistance may have to be taken into consideration in experiments.\n\n==Prolonging battery life==\nWhich electrical practices, and so which charger, are best suited for use depending entirely on the type of battery. NiCd cells must be fully discharged occasionally, or else the battery loses capacity over time due to a phenomenon known as \"[[memory effect]].\" Once a month (perhaps once every 30 charges) is sometimes recommended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This extends the life of the battery since memory effect is prevented while avoiding full [[charge cycle]]s which are known to be hard on all types of dry-cell batteries, eventually resulting in a permanent decrease in battery capacity.\n\nMost modern cell phones, laptops, and most electric vehicles use [[Lithium-ion]] batteries.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2bFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA675&dq=Most+modern+cell+phones,+laptops,+and+most+electric+vehicles+use+Lithium-ion+batteries&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj16d2qiI7VAhUW92MKHVbkA7kQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Most%20modern%20cell%20phones,%20laptops,%20and%20most%20electric%20vehicles%20use%20Lithium-ion%20batteries&f=false|title=Energy: Sources, Utilization, Legislation, Sustainability, Illinois as Model State|last=Mansoori|first=G.

As with all battery types, degradation also occurs faster at higher temperatures. Degradation in [[lithium-ion]] batteries is caused by an increased internal battery resistance often due to cell [[oxidation]]. This decreases the efficiency of the battery, resulting in less net current available to be drawn from the battery. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} However, if Li-ION cells are discharged below a certain voltage a chemical reaction occurs that make them dangerous if recharged, which is why many such batteries in consumer goods now have an \"electronic fuse\" that permanently disables them if the voltage falls below a set level. The electronic fuse circuitry draws a small amount of current from the battery, which means that if a laptop battery is left for a long time without charging it, and with a very low initial [[state of charge]], the battery may be permanently destroyed.\n\nMotor vehicles, such as boats, RVs, ATVs, motorcycles, cars, trucks, etc. have used [[lead\u2013acid]] batteries. These batteries employ a [[sulfuric acid]] [[electrolyte]] and can generally be charged and discharged without exhibiting memory effect, though [[sulfation]] (a chemical reaction in the battery which deposits a layer of sulfates on the lead) will occur over time. Typically sulfated batteries are simply replaced with new batteries, and the old ones recycled. [[Lead\u2013acid]] batteries will experience substantially longer life when a maintenance charger is used to \"float charge\" the battery.  This prevents the battery from ever being below 100% charge, preventing sulfate from forming.  Proper temperature compensated [[float voltage]] should be used to achieve the best results.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|Alternator]] \u2013 battery charging device in car\n* [[Electric bus#Charging]]\n* [[Battery eliminator]]\n* [[Battery management system]]\n* [[Charge controller]]\n* [[FuelRod]] \u2013 a kiosk-based charging service \n* [[Lithium-ion battery]]\n* [[Recharging alkaline batteries]]\n* [[Solar energy]]\n* [[Solar lamp]]\n* [[State of charge]] (batteries)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Battery chargers|Battery charger}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battery Charger}}\n[[Category:Battery chargers| ]]\n[[Category:Battery charging]]\n[[Category:Rechargeable batteries]]\n[[Category:Energy conversion]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|other senses of this term|AC adapter}}\n[[File:BatteryCharger1.jpg|thumb|upright|This unit charges the batteries until they reach a specific voltage and then it [[trickle charging|trickle charges]] the batteries until it is disconnected.]]\n[[File:Simple Charger.jpg|thumb|A simple charger equivalent to an AC/DC wall adapter.

Some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging (i.e., continued charging after the battery has been fully charged) and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source, depending on battery type. Simple chargers of this type must be manually disconnected at the end of the charge cycle, and some battery types absolutely require, or may use a timer, to cut off charging current at some fixed time, approximately when charging is complete. Other battery types cannot withstand over-charging, being damaged (reduced capacity, reduced lifetime), over heating or even exploding. \nThe charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to safely adjust the charging current and voltage, determine the [[state of charge]], and cut off at the end of charge.\n\nA trickle charger provides a relatively small amount of current, only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time. Some battery types cannot tolerate trickle charging of any kind;  attempts to do so may result in damage.  Lithium ion battery cells use a chemistry system which does not permit indefinite trickle charging.<ref>Phil Weicker, ''A Systems Approach to Lithium-Ion Battery Management'',Artech House, 2013 {{ISBN|1608076598}} page 26 </ref>\n\nSlow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge. High-rate chargers may restore most capacity much faster, but high rate chargers can be more than some battery types can tolerate. Such batteries require active monitoring of the battery to protect it from overcharging. Electric vehicles ideally need high-rate chargers. For public access, installation of such chargers and the distribution support for them is an issue in the proposed adoption of electric cars.\n\n==C-rate==\n{{see also|Battery (electricity)#C rate}}\nCharge and discharge rates are often given as ''C'' or ''C-rate'', which is a measure of the rate at which a battery is charged or discharged relative to its capacity. The C-rate is defined as the charge or discharge current divided by the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge. While rarely stated explicitly, the unit of the C-rate is [[hour|h]]<sup>\u22121</sup>, equivalent to stating the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge in unit hour times current in the same unit as the charge or discharge current. The C-rate is never negative, so whether it describes a charging or discharging process depends on the context.\n\nFor example, for a battery with a capacity of 500&nbsp;mAh, a discharge rate of 5000&nbsp;mA (i.e., 5&nbsp;A) corresponds to a C-rate of 10 (per hour), meaning that such a current can discharge 10 such batteries in one hour. Likewise, for the same battery a charge current of 250&nbsp;mA corresponds to a C-rate of 1/2 (per hour), meaning that this current will increase the state of charge of this battery by 50% in one hour.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary_battery_specifications.pdf |format= [[PDF]] |title= A Guide to Understanding Battery Specifications MIT Electric Vehicle Team  |website= [[mit.edu|web.mit.edu]] |date= December 2008 |accessdate= May 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince the unit of the C-rate is typically implied, some care is required when using it to avoid confusing it with the battery's capacity to store a charge, which in the [[International System of Units|SI]] has unit [[coulomb]] with unit symbol ''C''.\n\nIf both the (dis)charge current and the battery capacity in the C-rate ratio is multiplied by the battery voltage, the C-rate becomes a ratio of the (dis)charge power to the battery's energy capacity. For example, when the 100&nbsp;kWh battery in a [[Tesla Model S]] P100D is undergoing [[Tesla supercharger|supercharging]] at 120&nbsp;kW the C-rate is 1.2 (per hour) and when that battery delivers its maximum power of 451&nbsp;kW, its C-rate is 4.51 (per hour).\n\nAll charging and discharging of batteries generates internal heat, and the amount of heat generated is roughly proportional to the current involved (a battery's current state of charge, condition / history, etc. are also factors).  As some batteries reach their full charge, cooling may also be observed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/snva557/snva557.pdf| format=[[PDF]] |title=LM2576,LM3420,LP2951,LP2952 Battery Charging |website= [[ti.com|www.ti.com]] [date=July 2018 |accessdate= July 29, 2018}}</ref> Battery cells which have been built to allow higher C-rates than usual must make provision for increased heating. But high C-ratings are attractive to end users because such batteries can be charged more quickly, and produce higher current output in use.  High C-rates typically require the charger to carefully monitor battery parameters such as terminal voltage and temperature to prevent overcharging and so damage to the cells. Such high charging rates are possible only with some battery types. Others will be damaged or possibly overheat or catch fire. Some batteries may even explode. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} For example, an automobile SLI (starting, lighting, ignition) lead-acid battery carries [[Lead\u2013acid battery#Risk of explosion|several risks of explosion]].\n\n==Type==\n\n===Simple charger===\n\nA simple charger works by supplying a [[direct current|constant DC]] or [[pulsed DC]] [[electric power|power]] source to a battery being charged. A simple charger typically does not alter its output based on charging time or the charge on the battery. This simplicity means that a simple charger is inexpensive, but there are tradeoffs. Typically, a carefully designed simple charger takes longer to charge a battery because it is set to use a lower (i.e., safer) charging rate. Even so, many batteries left on a simple charger for too long will be weakened or destroyed due to over-charging. These chargers also vary in that they can supply either a constant voltage or a constant current, to the battery.\n\nSimple AC-powered battery chargers usually have much higher [[ripple (electrical)|ripple current and ripple voltage]] than other kinds of battery chargers because they are inexpensively designed and built.  Generally, when the ripple current is within a battery's manufacturer recommended level, the ripple voltage will also be well within the recommended level.  The maximum ripple current for a typical 12{{nbsp}}V 100{{nbsp}}Ah [[VRLA battery]] is 5 amps. As long as the ripple current is not excessive (more than 3 to 4 times the battery manufacturer recommended level), the expected life of a ripple-charged VRLA battery will be within 3% of the life of a constant DC-charged battery.<ref>\n[http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Brands/Liebert/Documents/White%20Papers/Effects%20of%20AC%20Ripple%20Current%20on%20VRLA%20Battery%20Life.pdf \"Effects of AC Ripple Current on VRLA Battery Life\"]\nby Emerson Network Power\n</ref>\n\n===Fast charger===\nFast chargers make use of control circuitry to rapidly charge the batteries without damaging any of the cells in the battery. The control circuitry can be built into the battery (generally for each cell) or in the external charging unit, or split between both. Most such chargers have a [[cooling fan]] to help keep the temperature of the cells at safe levels. Most fast chargers are also capable of acting as standard overnight chargers if used with standard NiMH cells that do not have the special control circuitry.\n\n===Three stage charger===\nTo accelerate the charging time and provide continuous charging, an intelligent charger attempts to detect the state of charge and condition of the battery and applies a 3-stage charging scheme. The following description assumes a sealed lead acid traction battery at 25{{nbsp}}\u00b0C. The first stage is referred to as \"bulk absorption\";  the charging current will be held high and constant and is limited by the capacity of the charger. When the voltage on the battery reaches its outgassing voltage (2.22 volts per cell) the charger switches to the second stage and the voltage is held constant (2.40 volts per cell). The delivered current will decline at the maintained voltage, and when the current reaches less than 0.005C the charger enters its third stage and the charger output will be held constant at 2.25 volts per cell. In the third stage, the charging current is very small 0.005C and at this voltage the battery can be maintained at full charge and compensate for self-discharge.\n\n===Induction-powered charger===\n{{Main|Inductive charging}}\n\nInductive battery chargers use [[electromagnetic induction]] to charge batteries. A charging station sends electromagnetic energy through [[inductive coupling]] to an electrical device, which stores the energy in the batteries. This is achieved without the need for metal contacts between the charger and the battery. Inductive battery chargers are commonly used in [[electric toothbrush]]es and other devices used in bathrooms. Because there are no open electrical contacts, there is no risk of electrocution. Nowadays it is being used to charge wireless phones.\n\n===Intelligent charger===\n[[Image:Ladeger\u00e4t.jpg|thumb|right| Example of a smart charger for AA and AAA batteries]]\nA \"smart charger\" should not be confused with a \"smart battery\". A [[smart battery]] is generally defined as one containing some sort of electronic device or \"chip\" that can communicate with a [[smart charger]] about battery characteristics and condition.  A smart battery generally requires a smart charger it can communicate with (see [[Smart Battery Data]]).  A smart charger is defined as a charger that can respond to the condition of a battery, and modify its charging actions accordingly.\n\nSome smart chargers are designed to charge:\n* \"smart\" batteries with internal protection or supervision or management circuitry.\n* \"dumb\" batteries, which lack any internal electronic circuitry.\n\nThe output current of a smart charger depends upon the battery's state. An intelligent charger may monitor the battery's voltage, temperature or time under charge to determine the optimum charge current and to terminate charging.\n\nFor [[nickel-cadmium battery|Ni-Cd]] and [[NiMH]] batteries, the voltage across the battery increases slowly during the charging process, until the battery is fully charged. After that, the voltage ''decreases'', which indicates to an intelligent charger that the battery is fully charged. Such chargers are often labeled as a \u0394V, \"delta-V,\" or sometimes \"delta peak\", charger, indicating that they monitor the voltage change.\n\nThe problem is, the magnitude of \"delta-V\" can become very small or even non-existent if (very) high{{Quantify|date=October 2010}} capacity rechargeable batteries are recharged.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This can cause even an intelligent battery charger to not sense that the batteries are actually already fully charged, and to continue charging. Overcharging of the batteries will result in some cases. However, many so called intelligent chargers employ a combination of cut off systems, which are intended to prevent overcharging in the vast majority of cases.\n\nA typical intelligent charger fast-charges a battery up to about 85% of its maximum capacity in less than an hour, then switches to trickle charging, which takes several hours to top off the battery to its full capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaging-resource.com/ACCS/BATTS/BATTS.HTM |title=The Great Battery Shootout |author=Dave Etchells}}</ref>\n\n===Motion-powered charger===\n[[Image: Linear induction flashlight.jpg|thumb|300px|Linear induction flashlight, charged by shaking along its long axis, causing magnet ''(visible at right)'' to slide through a coil of wire ''(center)'' to generate electricity]]\nSeveral companies have begun making devices that charge batteries based on human motions.  One example, made by [[Tremont Electric]], consists of a magnet held between two springs that can charge a battery as the device is moved up and down, such as when walking.  Such products have not yet achieved significant commercial success.<ref>Martin LaMonica, CNET. \"[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20076064-54/motion-powered-gadget-charger-back-on-track/?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20 Motion-powered gadget charger back on track].\" Jul 1, 2011.

The DC pulses have a strictly controlled [[rise time]], pulse width, pulse repetition rate ([[frequency]]) and [[amplitude]]. This technology is said to work with any size, voltage, capacity or chemistry of batteries, including automotive and [[VRLA|valve-regulated]] batteries.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/913/ |title=AN913: Switch-Mode, Linear, and Pulse Charging Techniques for Li+ Battery in Mobile Phones and PDAs |publisher=Maxim |year=2001}}\n</ref>\n\nWith pulse charging, high instantaneous voltages can be applied without overheating the battery.

There is no significant evidence, however, that negative pulse charging is more effective than ordinary pulse charging.\n\n===Solar charger===\n{{main|Solar charger}}\n{{Further|Energy harvesting}}\n[[File:Solar-Charger Varta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Varta]] Solar Charger Model 57082 with two 2100{{nbsp}}mAh Ni-MH rechargeable batteries]]\nSolar chargers convert light energy into low voltage [[DC current]]. They are generally [[wikt:portable|portable]], but can also be fixed mount.  Fixed mount solar chargers are also known as [[solar panels]]. Solar panels are often connected to the electrical grid via control and interface circuits, whereas portable solar chargers are used off-the-grid (i.e. [[Automobile|cars]], [[boats]], or [[RVs]]).\n\nAlthough portable solar chargers obtain energy from the sun only, they still can (depending on the technology) be used in low light (i.e. cloudy) applications.  Portable solar chargers are often used for [[trickle charging]], although some solar chargers (depending on the [[wattage]]), can completely recharge batteries. Other devices may exist, which combine this with other sources of energy for added recharging efficacy.\n\n===Timer-based charger===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe output of a [[timer]] charger is terminated after a pre-determined time. Timer chargers were the most common type for high-capacity [[Ni-Cd]] cells in the late 1990s for example (low-capacity consumer Ni-Cd cells were typically charged with a simple charger).\n\nOften a timer charger and set of batteries could be bought as a bundle and the charger time was set to suit those batteries. If batteries of lower capacity were charged then they would be overcharged, and if batteries of higher capacity were charged they would be only partly charged. With the trend for battery technology to increase capacity year on year, an old timer charger would only partly charge the newer batteries.\n\nTimer based chargers also had the drawback that charging batteries that were not fully discharged, even if those batteries were of the correct capacity for the particular timed charger, would result in over-charging.\n\n===Trickle charger===\n{{Main|Trickle charging}}\n\nA trickle charger is typically a low-current (usually between 5\u20131,500&nbsp;mA) battery charger or one which has a trickle charging operating mode. A trickle charger is generally used to charge small capacity batteries (2\u201330&nbsp;Ah). These types of battery chargers are also used to maintain larger capacity batteries (> 30&nbsp;Ah) that are typically found on cars, boats, RVs and other related vehicles. In larger applications, the current of the battery charger is sufficient only to provide a maintenance or trickle current (trickle is commonly the last charging stage of most battery chargers).  Depending on the technology of the trickle charger, it can be left connected to the battery indefinitely. Some battery chargers that can be left connected to the battery without causing the battery damage are also referred to as smart or intelligent chargers.  Some battery types are not suitable for trickle charging. For instance, most Li-ion batteries cannot be safely trickle charged, and the damage caused can be enough to cause a fire or even an explosion.\n\n===Universal battery charger\u2013analyzer===\nThe most sophisticated types are used in critical applications (e.g. military or aviation batteries).  These heavy-duty automatic \u201cintelligent charging\u201d systems can be programmed with complex charging cycles specified by the battery maker.  The best are universal (i.e. can charge all battery types), and include automatic capacity testing and analyzing functions too.\n\n===USB-based charger===\n{{Off topic||Off topic|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[File: Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket.jpg|thumb|Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket]]\n{{See also|USB#Power|ISO 4165}}\nSince the [[Universal Serial Bus]] specification provides for a five-volt power supply (with limited maximum power), it is possible to use a [[USB cable]] to connect a device to a power supply. Products based on this approach include chargers for [[cellular phone]]s, portable [[digital audio players]], and [[tablet computer]]s. They may be fully compliant USB peripheral devices adhering to USB power discipline, or uncontrolled in the manner of [[USB decoration]]s.\n\n====Power bank====\n\n[[Image:USB power bank.jpg|thumb|right|A power bank with USB cable.]]\n\nA power bank is a portable device that can supply power from its built-in battery through a USB port.  Power banks are popular for charging USB charged devices. They can also be used as a power supply for various USB powered devices such as lights and small fans. They usually recharge with a [[USB|USB power supply]].  The power bank includes a control circuit that both regulates charging of the battery and converts the battery voltage to 5.0 volts for the USB port. Some chargers for cells like 18650s and 26650 can also serve as a power bank.  Although it is generally more cumbersome to carry such a charger with cells rather than a conventional power bank, this arrangement can also charge cells for other uses, and swap cells that are dead.  It also has the advantage that, when the cells are dead, they can be swapped for fresh cells for immediate use rather than having to be recharged first.\n[[Image:Quintezz powerbank, opened.png|thumb|right|Many powerbanks use the common 18650 size [[lithium-ion battery]] which may be user-replaceable.]]\n\nSpecifications:\n* Capacity in Wh: Total power capacity measured by multiplying mAh by voltage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.powerbanktalk.com/best-power-banks/ |title=The Best USB Battery Packs}}</ref>\n* Capacity in mAh: [[mAh]] stands for milli Ampere-hour and measures the amount of power flow that can be supplied by a certain power bank at a specific voltage. Many manufacturers rate their products at 3.7 V, the voltage of cell(s) inside. Since USB outputs at 5 V, calculations at this voltage will yield a lower mAh number. For example, a battery pack advertised with a 3000 mAh capacity (at 3.7 V) will produce 2220 mAh at 5 V.  Power losses due to efficiency of the charging circuitry also occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/portable-power-bank-capacities-gary-explains-699550/ |title=Does a 3000 mAh portable power bank charge a 3000 mAh phone? |publisher=Android Authority |date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>\n* Simultaneous charging and discharging (also known as ''\u201cpassthrough\u201d charging''<ref name=RAV_passthrough2>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2018/06/pass-through-creative-ways-power-banks-charge/ RavPower.com blog article: \u201cHow Pass Through Charging Lets You Use Power Banks In Creative Ways\u201d]</ref><ref name=RAV_passthrough>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2017/10/danger-and-damage-of-pass-through-technology-for-batteries/ RAVpower Blog article: \u201cWhat is Passthrough Charging?\u201d]</ref>): need to specify if the powerbank's ports can output power while it being charged itself.\n* Number of output [[USB]] ports: This specifies the number of devices that can be charged simultaneously.\n* Output current rating: This specifies the current rating that it can charge maximum.

Power banks are available in different capacity ratings.\n\n====Compatibility====\n[[File:Mini, micro and J10 USB connectors.jpg|thumb|Mini, micro and J10 USB charging connectors]]\n[[File:Lightning connector.svg|thumb|Lightning connector]]\n[[File:USB charger with three different charging ports.png|thumb|Australian 240 V USB charger with three different types of charging ports]]\nAlthough a standard exists for USB chargers<ref>{{cite web |title=IEC - Newslog > 2011-02-01: One size-fits-all mobile phone charger: IEC publishes first globally relevant standard |url=http://www.iec.ch/newslog/2011/nr0311.htm |website=www.iec.ch |accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref>, there are two areas of common incompatibility.\n* The connector on the device to be charged. There are several current and many obsolete connectors, including:\n**The [[Micro USB]] connector\n**The [[Mini USB]] connector\n**The [[USB-C]] connector\n**The [[lightning connector]]\n**The [[J10 connector]]\n**Various sizes of [[coaxial power connector]], particularly the smaller sizes\n**The [[3.5 mm jack]] and [[2.5 mm jack]]\n:and others. It is essential that the connectors on the device and charger match exactly, so that the correct polarity is used.  Reversing the polarity between a battery and its charger is likely to cause battery failure and even charger failure.  The failures may result in fire or damaged / destroyed equipment..\n* The charging port. This may be smart or dumb, and each in various current ratings. Compatibility varies and must be checked to maximize safety . A mismatched charger will charge more slowly, and sometimes not at all.\n\n==Applications==\nSince a battery charger is intended to be connected to a battery, it may not have voltage regulation or filtering of the DC voltage output;  it is cheaper to make them that way. Battery chargers equipped with both voltage regulation and filtering are sometimes termed [[battery eliminator]]s.\n\n===Battery charger for vehicles===\nThere are two main types of chargers used for vehicles:\n* To recharge a fuel vehicle's [[Car battery|starter battery]], where a modular charger is used; typically an [[IUoU battery charging|3-stage charger]].\n* To recharge an electric vehicle (EV) battery pack; see [[Charging station]].\n\nChargers for car batteries come in varying ratings. Chargers that are rated up to two amperes may be used to maintain charge on parked vehicle batteries or for small batteries on garden tractors or similar equipment. A motorist may keep a charger rated a few amperes to ten or fifteen amperes for maintenance of automobile batteries or to recharge a vehicle battery that has accidentally discharged. Service stations and commercial garages will have a large charger to fully charge a battery in an hour or two; often these chargers can briefly source the hundreds of amperes required to crank an internal combustion engine starter.\n\n=== Electric vehicle batteries===\n\nElectric vehicle battery chargers (ECS) come in a variety of brands and characteristics. These chargers vary from 1&nbsp;kW to 7.5&nbsp;kW maximum charge rate. Some use algorithm charge curves, others use constant voltage, constant current. Some are programmable by the end user through a [[Controller area network|CAN]] port, some have dials for maximum voltage and amperage, some are preset to specified battery pack voltage, amp-hour and chemistry. Prices range from $400 to $4500.\n\nA 10 amp-hour battery could take 15 hours to reach a fully charged state from a fully discharged condition with a 1 amp charger as it would require roughly 1.5 times the battery's capacity.\n\nPublic EV [[charging station]]s provide 6&nbsp;kW (host power of 208 to 240 VAC off a 40 amp circuit). 6&nbsp;kW will recharge an EV roughly 6 times faster than 1&nbsp;kW overnight charging.\n\nRapid charging results in even faster recharge times and is limited only by available AC power, battery type, and the type of charging system.<ref>[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/09/fuji-heavy-spee.html Fuji Heavy Speeds Up Recharging of R1e EV]. Green Car Congress (2007-09-18). Retrieved on 2011-11-11.</ref>\n\nOnboard EV chargers (change AC power to DC power to recharge the EV's pack) can be:\n* Isolated: they make no physical connection between the [[Alternating current|A/C]] electrical [[mains electricity|mains]] and the batteries being charged. These typically employ some form of inductive connection between the grid and a charging vehicle. Some isolated chargers may be used in parallel. This allows for an increased charge current and reduced charging times. The battery has a maximum current rating that cannot be exceeded\n* Non-isolated: the battery charger has a direct electrical connection to the A/C outlet's wiring. Non-isolated chargers cannot be used in parallel.\n\n[[Power Factor Correction]] (PFC) chargers can more closely approach the maximum current the plug can deliver, shortening charging time.\n\n====Charge stations====\n{{Main|Charging station}}\n\n[[Better Place (company)|Project Better Place]] was deploying a network of charging stations and subsidizing vehicle battery costs through [[leasing|leases]] and credits until filing for bankruptcy in May 2013.\n[[File:Charge6 3wACin.jpg|thumb|Auxiliary charger designed to fit a variety of proprietary devices]]\n\n====Induction-powered charging====\nResearchers at the [[Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] (KAIST) have developed an electric transport system (called [[Online Electric Vehicle]], OLEV)  where the vehicles get their power needs from cables underneath the surface of the road via [[inductive charging]], (where a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself.<ref>[http://www.gizmag.com/kaist-olev-electric-vehicle/12557/ Korean electric vehicle solution].

Older ones are notoriously diverse, having a wide variety of [[DC connector]]-styles and voltages, most of which are not compatible with other manufacturers' phones or even different models of phones from a single manufacturer.\n\nUsers of publicly accessible charging kiosks must be able to cross-reference connectors with device brands/models and individual charge parameters and thus ensure delivery of the correct charge for their mobile device. A database-driven system is one solution, and is being incorporated into some designs of charging kiosks.\n\nThere are also human-powered chargers sold on the market, which typically consists of a [[dynamo]] powered by a hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and extension cords. A French startup offers a kind of dynamo charger inspired by the [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]] that can be used with only one hand.<ref>[http://www.todaysiphone.com/2013/06/charge-your-mobile-device-wherever-you-are-using-voltmaker/ Charge your iPhone by spinning Voltmaker around like a mini helicopter].

It can charge mobile phone 4 times faster than standard micro USB.\n\n===Stationary battery plants===\nTelecommunications, electric power, and computer [[uninterruptible power supply]] facilities may have very large standby battery banks (installed in [[battery room]]s) to maintain critical loads for several hours during interruptions of primary grid power. Such chargers are permanently installed and equipped with temperature compensation, supervisory alarms for various system faults, and often redundant independent power supplies and redundant rectifier systems. Chargers for stationary battery plants may have adequate voltage regulation and filtration and sufficient current capacity to allow the battery to be disconnected for maintenance, while the charger supplies the DC system load. Capacity of the charger is specified to maintain the system load and recharge a completely discharged battery within, say, 8 hours or other interval.\n\n===Use in experiments===\nA battery charger can work as a DC [[power adapter]] for experimentation. It may, however, require an external [[capacitor]] to be connected across its output terminals in order to \"smooth\" the voltage sufficiently, which may be thought of as a DC voltage plus a \"[[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]]\" voltage added to it.  There may be an [[internal resistance]] connected to limit the short circuit current, and the value of that internal resistance may have to be taken into consideration in experiments.\n\n==Prolonging battery life==\nWhich electrical practices, and so which charger, are best suited for use depending entirely on the type of battery. NiCd cells must be fully discharged occasionally, or else the battery loses capacity over time due to a phenomenon known as \"[[memory effect]].\" Once a month (perhaps once every 30 charges) is sometimes recommended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This extends the life of the battery since memory effect is prevented while avoiding full [[charge cycle]]s which are known to be hard on all types of dry-cell batteries, eventually resulting in a permanent decrease in battery capacity.\n\nMost modern cell phones, laptops, and most electric vehicles use [[Lithium-ion]] batteries.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2bFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA675&dq=Most+modern+cell+phones,+laptops,+and+most+electric+vehicles+use+Lithium-ion+batteries&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj16d2qiI7VAhUW92MKHVbkA7kQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Most%20modern%20cell%20phones,%20laptops,%20and%20most%20electric%20vehicles%20use%20Lithium-ion%20batteries&f=false|title=Energy: Sources, Utilization, Legislation, Sustainability, Illinois as Model State|last=Mansoori|first=G.

Barnie|date=2015-11-05|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814704021|language=en}}</ref>  These batteries last longest if the battery is frequently charged; fully discharging the cells will degrade their capacity relatively quickly, but most such batteries are used in equipment which can sense the approach of full discharge and discontinue equipment use.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} When stored after charging, lithium battery cells degrade more while fully charged than if they are only 40-50% charged. As with all battery types, degradation also occurs faster at higher temperatures. Degradation in [[lithium-ion]] batteries is caused by an increased internal battery resistance often due to cell [[oxidation]]. This decreases the efficiency of the battery, resulting in less net current available to be drawn from the battery. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} However, if Li-ION cells are discharged below a certain voltage a chemical reaction occurs that make them dangerous if recharged, which is why many such batteries in consumer goods now have an \"electronic fuse\" that permanently disables them if the voltage falls below a set level. The electronic fuse circuitry draws a small amount of current from the battery, which means that if a laptop battery is left for a long time without charging it, and with a very low initial [[state of charge]], the battery may be permanently destroyed.\n\nMotor vehicles, such as boats, RVs, ATVs, motorcycles, cars, trucks, etc. have used [[lead\u2013acid]] batteries. These batteries employ a [[sulfuric acid]] [[electrolyte]] and can generally be charged and discharged without exhibiting memory effect, though [[sulfation]] (a chemical reaction in the battery which deposits a layer of sulfates on the lead) will occur over time. Typically sulfated batteries are simply replaced with new batteries, and the old ones recycled. [[Lead\u2013acid]] batteries will experience substantially longer life when a maintenance charger is used to \"float charge\" the battery.  This prevents the battery from ever being below 100% charge, preventing sulfate from forming.  Proper temperature compensated [[float voltage]] should be used to achieve the best results.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|Alternator]] \u2013 battery charging device in car\n* [[Electric bus#Charging]]\n* [[Battery eliminator]]\n* [[Battery management system]]\n* [[Charge controller]]\n* [[FuelRod]] \u2013 a kiosk-based charging service \n* [[Lithium-ion battery]]\n* [[Recharging alkaline batteries]]\n* [[Solar energy]]\n* [[Solar lamp]]\n* [[State of charge]] (batteries)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Battery chargers|Battery charger}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battery Charger}}\n[[Category:Battery chargers| ]]\n[[Category:Battery charging]]\n[[Category:Rechargeable batteries]]\n[[Category:Energy conversion]]\n", "name_user": "Tecgyan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePower bank:Adding importance of fast charging power bank.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger"}

The term originated in the early 16th century after [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus was gonna kinda like a day made landfall]] in what would later be called the Americas in the [[Age of Discovery]], expanding the geographical horizon of [[History of geography#Greco-Roman world|classical geographers]], who had thought about that this morning of the [[world]] as consisting of [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]], collectively now referred to as the [[Old World]] (a.k.a. [[Afro-Eurasiarge Tyler Northrup, Princeton University Press; 1916.</ref> The Americas were also referred to a life re-examined.

Matth\u00e4us Merian, 1631.]]\n\nThe terms \"[[Old World]]\" vs. \"New World\" are meaningful in historical context and for the purpose of distinguishing the world's major [[ecozones]], and to classify plant and animal species that originated therein.\n\nOne can speak of the \"New World\" in a [[history|historical]] context, e.g., when discussing the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]], the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]] and other events of the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial]] period. For lack of alternatives, the term is also still useful to those discussing issues that concern the Americas and the nearby [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]], such as [[Bermuda]] and [[Clipperton Island]], collectively.\n\nThe term \"New World\" is used in a [[biology|biological]] context, when one speaks of Old World ([[Palearctic ecozone|Palearctic]], [[Afrotropic ecozone|Afrotropic]]) and New World species ([[Nearctic ecozone|Nearctic]], [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropic]]). Biological [[Biological classification|taxonomists]] often attach the \"New World\" label to groups of species that are found exclusively in the Americas, to distinguish them from their counterparts in the \"Old World\" (Europe, Africa and Asia), e.g. [[New World monkey]]s, [[New World vulture]]s, [[New World warbler]]s.\n\nThe label is also often used in agriculture. Asia, Africa, and Europe share a common agricultural history stemming from the [[Neolithic Revolution]], and the same domesticated plants and animals spread through these three continents thousands of years ago, making them largely indistinct and useful to classify together as \"Old World\". Common Old World crops (e.g., [[barley]], [[lentil]]s, [[oats]], [[pea]]s, [[rye]], [[wheat]]), and domesticated animals (e.g., [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[goat]]s, [[horse]]s, [[pig]]s, [[sheep]]) did not exist in the Americas until they were introduced by post-[[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbian contact]] in the 1490s (see \"[[Columbian Exchange]]\"). Conversely, many common [[crops]] were originally domesticated in the Americas before they spread worldwide after Columbian contact, and are still often referred to as \"[[New World crops]]\"; [[common bean]]s (''phaseolus''), [[maize]], and [[squash (plant)|squash]] \u2013 the \"[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]]\" \u2013 as well as the [[avocado]], [[tomato]], and wide varieties of [[capsicum]] ([[bell pepper]], [[chili pepper]], etc.), and the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] were originally domesticated by [[pre-Columbian]] peoples in [[Mesoamerica]], while agriculturalists in the [[Andean]] region of South America brought forth the [[cassava]], [[peanut]], [[potato]], [[quinoa]] and domesticated animals like the [[alpaca]], [[guinea pig]] and [[llama]]. Other famous New World crops include the [[cashew]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[rubber]], [[sunflower]], [[tobacco]], and [[vanilla]], and fruits like the [[guava]], [[papaya]] and [[pineapple]]. There are rare instances of overlap, e.g., the [[calabash]] (bottle-gourd), [[cotton]], and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], and the [[dog]], are believed to have been domesticated separately in both the [[Old World|Old]] and New World, their early forms possibly brought along by [[Paleo-Indians]] from Asia during the [[last glacial period]].\n\nIn [[wine terminology]], \"New World\" has a different definition. \"[[New World wines]]\" include not only North American and South American wines, but also those from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and all other locations outside the traditional wine-growing regions of Europe, North Africa and the Near East.<ref name=\"Wine Folly\">{{cite web|url=http://winefolly.com/review/new-world-vs-old-world-wine/|title=Real Differences: New World vs Old World Wine |publisher= Wine Folly|date=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Origin of term==\n\n[[File:Stradanus America.jpg|thumb|Allegory of the New World: [[Amerigo Vespucci]] awakens the sleeping America]] \nThe term \"New World\" (\"Mundus Novus\") was first coined by the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], in a letter written to his friend and former patron [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici]] in the Spring of 1503, and published (in [[Latin]]) in 1503\u201304 under the title ''Mundus Novus''. Vespucci's letter contains arguably the first explicit articulation in print of the hypothesis that the lands discovered by European navigators to the west were not the edges of Asia, as asserted by [[Christopher Columbus]], but rather an entirely different continent, a \"New World\".<ref name=\"M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417\"/>\n\nAccording to ''Mundus Novus'', Vespucci realized that he was in a \"New World\" on 7 August 1501 as he arrived in Brazil and compared the nature and people of the place with what Portuguese sailors told him about Asia. In fact, a famous chance meeting between two different expeditions had occurred at the watering stop of \"Bezeguiche\" (the Bay of [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]) \u2013 Vespucci's own outgoing expedition, on its way to chart the coast of newly discovered [[Brazil]], and the vanguard ships of the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second Portuguese India armada]] of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], returning home from India. Having already visited the Americas in prior years, Vespucci probably found it difficult to reconcile what he had already seen in the [[West Indies]], with what the returning sailors told him of the [[East Indies]]. Vespucci wrote a preliminary letter to Lorenzo, while anchored at Bezeguiche, which he sent back with the Portuguese fleet \u2013 at this point only expressing a certain puzzlement about his conversations.<ref>This preliminary letter from Bezeguiche was not published, but remained in manuscript form. It is reproduced in F.A. de Varnhagen (1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 78\u201382]).</ref> Vespucci was finally convinced when he proceeded on his mapping expedition through 1501\u201302, covering the huge stretch of coast of eastern Brazil. After returning from Brazil, in the Spring of 1503, Amerigo Vespucci composed the ''Mundus Novus'' letter in Lisbon to Lorenzo in Florence, with its famous opening paragraph:<ref>English translation of ''Mundus Novus'' as found in Markham (1894: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8wAuAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 42\u201352])</ref>\n\n{{quote|In passed days I wrote very fully to you of my return from new countries, which have been found and explored with the ships, at the cost and by the command of this Most Serene King of Portugal; and it is lawful to call it a new world, because none of these countries were known to our ancestors and all who hear about them they will be entirely new.  For the opinion of the ancients was, that the greater part of the world beyond the equinoctial line to the south was not land, but only sea, which they have called the Atlantic; and even if they have affirmed that any continent is there, they have given many reasons for denying it is inhabited. But this opinion is false, and entirely opposed to the truth. My last voyage has proved it, for I have found a continent in that southern part; full of animals and more populous than our Europe, or Asia, or Africa, and even more temperate and pleasant than any other region known to us.|}}\n\nVespucci's letter was a publishing sensation in Europe, immediately (and repeatedly) reprinted in several other countries.<ref>Varnhagen, ''Amer\u00edgo Vespucci'' (1865:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 13\u201326]) provides side-by-side reproductions of both the 1503 Latin version ''Mundus Novus'', and the 1507 Italian re-translation \"El Nuovo Mondo de Lengue Spagnole interpretato in Idioma Ro. Libro Quinto\" (from ''Paesi Nuovamente retrovati''). The Latin version of ''Mundus Novus'' was reprinted many times (see Varnhagen, 1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 9] for a list of early reprints).</ref>\n\n=== Prior usage ===\n\nWhile Amerigo Vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term \"New World\" (''Mundus Novus'') for the Americas in his 1503 letter, certainly giving it its popular cachet, similar terms had nonetheless been used and applied before him.\n\nThe [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] had used the term \"un altro mundo\" (\"another world\") to refer to [[sub-Saharan Africa]], which he explored in 1455 and 1456 on behalf of the Portuguese.<ref>Cadamosto ''Navigationi'', c. 1470, as reprinted in Giovanni Ramusio (1554: [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_iZ5TZHXOnYcC/page/n215 p. 106]). See also M. Zamora ''Reading Columbus'', (1993: p. 121)</ref> However, this was merely a literary flourish, not a suggestion of a new \"fourth\" part of the world. Cadamosto was quite aware sub-Saharan Africa was firmly part of the African continent.\n\nThe [[Italy|Italian]]-born Spanish chronicler [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] often shares credit with Vespucci for designating the Americas as a new world.<ref>{{cite book| last= de Madariaga | first= Salvador | authorlink= Salvador de Madariaga | year=1952 | publisher= Editorial Hermes | location= Mexico | edition= 5th | title= Vida del muy magn\u00edfico se\u00f1or Don Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n | page= 363 | quote= \"nuevo mundo\", [...] designaci\u00f3n que Pedro M\u00e1rtyr ser\u00e1 el primero en usar | language= Spanish}}</ref> Peter Martyr used the term ''Orbe Novo'' (literally, \"New Globe\", but often translated as \"New World\") in the title of his history of the discovery of the Americas as a whole, which began to appear in 1511 (cosmologically, \"orbis\" as used here refers to the whole hemisphere, while \"mundus\" refers to the land within it).<ref>J.Z.

However, out of uncertainty, they depicted a finger of the Asian land mass stretching across the top to the eastern edge of the map, suggesting it carried over into the western hemisphere (e.g. the Cantino Planisphere denotes [[Greenland]] as \"Punta d'Asia\" \u2013 \"edge of Asia\"). Some maps, e.g. the 1506 [[Contarini\u2013Rosselli map]] and the 1508 [[Johannes Ruysch]] map, bowing to Ptolemaic authority and Columbus's assertions, have the northern Asian landmass stretching well into the western hemisphere and merging with known North America (Labrador, Newfoundland, etc.).

However, [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]]'s map of 1516 retreats considerably from his earlier map and back to classical authority, with the Asian land mass merging into North America (which he now calls ''Terra de Cuba Asie partis''), and quietly drops the \"America\" label from South America, calling it merely ''[[Terra incognita]]''.<ref name = parry/>\n\nThe western coast of the New World \u2013 the [[Pacific Ocean]] \u2013 was only discovered in 1513 by [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]].

It would be several more years before the Pacific Coast of North America was mapped, dispelling lingering doubts. Until the discovery of the [[Bering Strait]]s in the 17th century, there was no absolute confirmation that Asia and North America were not connected, and some European maps of the 16th century still continued to hopefully depict North America connected by a land bridge to Asia (e.g. the 1533 [[Johannes Sch\u00f6ner globe]]).<ref name = parry/>\n\nIn 1524, the term was used by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in a record of his voyage that year along the Atlantic coast of [[North America]], land that is now part of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].<ref>Verrazzano, Giovanni da (1524).[http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm \"The Written Record of the Voyage of 1524 of Giovanni da Verrazzano as recorded in a letter to Francis I, King of France, July 8th, 1524\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908085440/http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm |date=8 September 2006 }}.

The term originated in the early 16th century after [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Europeans made landfall]] in what would later be called the Americas in the [[Age of Discovery]], expanding the geographical horizon of [[History of geography#Greco-Roman world|classical geographers]], who had thought of the [[world]] as consisting of [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]], collectively now referred to as the [[Old World]] (a.k.a. [[Afro-Eurasia]]). The phrase gained prominence after the publication of a pamphlet titled ''Mundus Novus'' attributed to [[Italians|Italian]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/mundusnovuslette00vesp Mundus Novus: Letter to Lorenzo Pietro Di Medici], by Amerigo Vespucci; translation by George Tyler Northrup, Princeton University Press; 1916.</ref> The Americas were also referred to as the \"fourth part of the world\".<ref name=\"M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417\">M.H.Davidson (1997) ''Columbus Then and Now, a life re-examined.

Matth\u00e4us Merian, 1631.]]\n\nThe terms \"[[Old World]]\" vs. \"New World\" are meaningful in historical context and for the purpose of distinguishing the world's major [[ecozones]], and to classify plant and animal species that originated therein.\n\nOne can speak of the \"New World\" in a [[history|historical]] context, e.g., when discussing the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]], the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]] and other events of the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial]] period. For lack of alternatives, the term is also still useful to those discussing issues that concern the Americas and the nearby [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]], such as [[Bermuda]] and [[Clipperton Island]], collectively.\n\nThe term \"New World\" is used in a [[biology|biological]] context, when one speaks of Old World ([[Palearctic ecozone|Palearctic]], [[Afrotropic ecozone|Afrotropic]]) and New World species ([[Nearctic ecozone|Nearctic]], [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropic]]). Biological [[Biological classification|taxonomists]] often attach the \"New World\" label to groups of species that are found exclusively in the Americas, to distinguish them from their counterparts in the \"Old World\" (Europe, Africa and Asia), e.g. [[New World monkey]]s, [[New World vulture]]s, [[New World warbler]]s.\n\nThe label is also often used in agriculture. Asia, Africa, and Europe share a common agricultural history stemming from the [[Neolithic Revolution]], and the same domesticated plants and animals spread through these three continents thousands of years ago, making them largely indistinct and useful to classify together as \"Old World\". Common Old World crops (e.g., [[barley]], [[lentil]]s, [[oats]], [[pea]]s, [[rye]], [[wheat]]), and domesticated animals (e.g., [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[goat]]s, [[horse]]s, [[pig]]s, [[sheep]]) did not exist in the Americas until they were introduced by post-[[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbian contact]] in the 1490s (see \"[[Columbian Exchange]]\"). Conversely, many common [[crops]] were originally domesticated in the Americas before they spread worldwide after Columbian contact, and are still often referred to as \"[[New World crops]]\"; [[common bean]]s (''phaseolus''), [[maize]], and [[squash (plant)|squash]] \u2013 the \"[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]]\" \u2013 as well as the [[avocado]], [[tomato]], and wide varieties of [[capsicum]] ([[bell pepper]], [[chili pepper]], etc.), and the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] were originally domesticated by [[pre-Columbian]] peoples in [[Mesoamerica]], while agriculturalists in the [[Andean]] region of South America brought forth the [[cassava]], [[peanut]], [[potato]], [[quinoa]] and domesticated animals like the [[alpaca]], [[guinea pig]] and [[llama]]. Other famous New World crops include the [[cashew]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[rubber]], [[sunflower]], [[tobacco]], and [[vanilla]], and fruits like the [[guava]], [[papaya]] and [[pineapple]]. There are rare instances of overlap, e.g., the [[calabash]] (bottle-gourd), [[cotton]], and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], and the [[dog]], are believed to have been domesticated separately in both the [[Old World|Old]] and New World, their early forms possibly brought along by [[Paleo-Indians]] from Asia during the [[last glacial period]].\n\nIn [[wine terminology]], \"New World\" has a different definition. \"[[New World wines]]\" include not only North American and South American wines, but also those from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and all other locations outside the traditional wine-growing regions of Europe, North Africa and the Near East.<ref name=\"Wine Folly\">{{cite web|url=http://winefolly.com/review/new-world-vs-old-world-wine/|title=Real Differences: New World vs Old World Wine |publisher= Wine Folly|date=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Origin of term==\n\n[[File:Stradanus America.jpg|thumb|Allegory of the New World: [[Amerigo Vespucci]] awakens the sleeping America]] \nThe term \"New World\" (\"Mundus Novus\") was first coined by the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], in a letter written to his friend and former patron [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici]] in the Spring of 1503, and published (in [[Latin]]) in 1503\u201304 under the title ''Mundus Novus''. Vespucci's letter contains arguably the first explicit articulation in print of the hypothesis that the lands discovered by European navigators to the west were not the edges of Asia, as asserted by [[Christopher Columbus]], but rather an entirely different continent, a \"New World\".<ref name=\"M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417\"/>\n\nAccording to ''Mundus Novus'', Vespucci realized that he was in a \"New World\" on 7 August 1501 as he arrived in Brazil and compared the nature and people of the place with what Portuguese sailors told him about Asia. In fact, a famous chance meeting between two different expeditions had occurred at the watering stop of \"Bezeguiche\" (the Bay of [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]) \u2013 Vespucci's own outgoing expedition, on its way to chart the coast of newly discovered [[Brazil]], and the vanguard ships of the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second Portuguese India armada]] of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], returning home from India. Having already visited the Americas in prior years, Vespucci probably found it difficult to reconcile what he had already seen in the [[West Indies]], with what the returning sailors told him of the [[East Indies]]. Vespucci wrote a preliminary letter to Lorenzo, while anchored at Bezeguiche, which he sent back with the Portuguese fleet \u2013 at this point only expressing a certain puzzlement about his conversations.<ref>This preliminary letter from Bezeguiche was not published, but remained in manuscript form. It is reproduced in F.A. de Varnhagen (1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 78\u201382]).</ref> Vespucci was finally convinced when he proceeded on his mapping expedition through 1501\u201302, covering the huge stretch of coast of eastern Brazil. After returning from Brazil, in the Spring of 1503, Amerigo Vespucci composed the ''Mundus Novus'' letter in Lisbon to Lorenzo in Florence, with its famous opening paragraph:<ref>English translation of ''Mundus Novus'' as found in Markham (1894: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8wAuAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 42\u201352])</ref>\n\n{{quote|In passed days I wrote very fully to you of my return from new countries, which have been found and explored with the ships, at the cost and by the command of this Most Serene King of Portugal; and it is lawful to call it a new world, because none of these countries were known to our ancestors and all who hear about them they will be entirely new.  For the opinion of the ancients was, that the greater part of the world beyond the equinoctial line to the south was not land, but only sea, which they have called the Atlantic; and even if they have affirmed that any continent is there, they have given many reasons for denying it is inhabited. But this opinion is false, and entirely opposed to the truth. My last voyage has proved it, for I have found a continent in that southern part; full of animals and more populous than our Europe, or Asia, or Africa, and even more temperate and pleasant than any other region known to us.|}}\n\nVespucci's letter was a publishing sensation in Europe, immediately (and repeatedly) reprinted in several other countries.<ref>Varnhagen, ''Amer\u00edgo Vespucci'' (1865:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 13\u201326]) provides side-by-side reproductions of both the 1503 Latin version ''Mundus Novus'', and the 1507 Italian re-translation \"El Nuovo Mondo de Lengue Spagnole interpretato in Idioma Ro. Libro Quinto\" (from ''Paesi Nuovamente retrovati''). The Latin version of ''Mundus Novus'' was reprinted many times (see Varnhagen, 1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 9] for a list of early reprints).</ref>\n\n=== Prior usage ===\n\nWhile Amerigo Vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term \"New World\" (''Mundus Novus'') for the Americas in his 1503 letter, certainly giving it its popular cachet, similar terms had nonetheless been used and applied before him.\n\nThe [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] had used the term \"un altro mundo\" (\"another world\") to refer to [[sub-Saharan Africa]], which he explored in 1455 and 1456 on behalf of the Portuguese.<ref>Cadamosto ''Navigationi'', c. 1470, as reprinted in Giovanni Ramusio (1554: [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_iZ5TZHXOnYcC/page/n215 p. 106]). See also M. Zamora ''Reading Columbus'', (1993: p. 121)</ref> However, this was merely a literary flourish, not a suggestion of a new \"fourth\" part of the world. Cadamosto was quite aware sub-Saharan Africa was firmly part of the African continent.\n\nThe [[Italy|Italian]]-born Spanish chronicler [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] often shares credit with Vespucci for designating the Americas as a new world.<ref>{{cite book| last= de Madariaga | first= Salvador | authorlink= Salvador de Madariaga | year=1952 | publisher= Editorial Hermes | location= Mexico | edition= 5th | title= Vida del muy magn\u00edfico se\u00f1or Don Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n | page= 363 | quote= \"nuevo mundo\", [...] designaci\u00f3n que Pedro M\u00e1rtyr ser\u00e1 el primero en usar | language= Spanish}}</ref> Peter Martyr used the term ''Orbe Novo'' (literally, \"New Globe\", but often translated as \"New World\") in the title of his history of the discovery of the Americas as a whole, which began to appear in 1511 (cosmologically, \"orbis\" as used here refers to the whole hemisphere, while \"mundus\" refers to the land within it).<ref>J.Z.

In his own 1499 letter to the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain, reporting the results of his third voyage, Columbus relates how the massive waters of the [[Orinoco]] delta rushing into the [[Gulf of Paria]] implied that a previously unknown continent must lie behind it.<ref>\"if the river mentioned does not proceed from the terrestrial paradise, it comes from an immense tract of land situated in the south, of which no knowledge has been hitherto obtained\" (Columbus 1499 letter on the third voyage, as reproduced in R.H.

However, [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]]'s map of 1516 retreats considerably from his earlier map and back to classical authority, with the Asian land mass merging into North America (which he now calls ''Terra de Cuba Asie partis''), and quietly drops the \"America\" label from South America, calling it merely ''[[Terra incognita]]''.<ref name = parry/>\n\nThe western coast of the New World \u2013 the [[Pacific Ocean]] \u2013 was only discovered in 1513 by [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]]. But it would take a few more years until another [[Portugal|Portuguese]] \u2013 [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s voyage of 1519\u201322 \u2013 determined that the Pacific definitely formed a single large body of water separating Asia from the Americas. It would be several more years before the Pacific Coast of North America was mapped, dispelling lingering doubts. Until the discovery of the [[Bering Strait]]s in the 17th century, there was no absolute confirmation that Asia and North America were not connected, and some European maps of the 16th century still continued to hopefully depict North America connected by a land bridge to Asia (e.g. the 1533 [[Johannes Sch\u00f6ner globe]]).<ref name = parry/>\n\nIn 1524, the term was used by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in a record of his voyage that year along the Atlantic coast of [[North America]], land that is now part of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].<ref>Verrazzano, Giovanni da (1524).[http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm \"The Written Record of the Voyage of 1524 of Giovanni da Verrazzano as recorded in a letter to Francis I, King of France, July 8th, 1524\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908085440/http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm |date=8 September 2006 }}.

The unit, named after its commander [[Oskar Dirlewanger]], consisted of convicted criminals who were not expected to survive their service with the unit. Originally formed for [[counter-insurgency]] duties against the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]], it was used in the ''[[Bandenbek\u00e4mpfung]]'' (\"bandit-fighting\") actions in [[German-occupied Europe|German-occupied Eastern Europe]]. \n\nDuring its operations, the unit participated in the [[mass murder]] of civilians and other [[war crimes]] in [[German-occupied Europe|German-occupied Eastern Europe]] and gained a reputation among [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht]] and [[Waffen-SS]] officers for its brutality. Several commanders attempted to remove Dirlewanger from command and dissolve the unit but he was protected by powerful patrons within the Nazi apparatus who intervened on his behalf. Amongst other actions, the unit took part in the [[destruction of Warsaw]] and the massacre of around 100,000 of the city's inhabitants during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] as well as the brutal suppression of the [[Slovak National Uprising]] in 1944. \n\n==Oskar Dirlewanger==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S73495, Oskar Dirlewanger.jpg|thumb|Oskar Dirlewanger in 1944]]\n{{Main|Oskar Dirlewanger}}\nThe Dirlewanger Brigade is associated with its commander, Oskar Dirlewanger, a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] called the most evil man in the SS.<ref name=\"Bishop\" /> After receiving the [[Iron Cross]] first and second class while serving in the [[Army of W\u00fcrttemberg]] during [[World War I]], Dirlewanger joined the ''[[Freikorps]]'' and took part in the crushing of the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]]. He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1923. After graduation from [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Citizens' University]], Dirlewanger worked at a bank and a knitwear factory. He became a violent alcoholic, and in 1934 was convicted of the [[statutory rape]] of a [[Minor (law)|14-year-old girl]] and stealing government property. The Nazi Party expelled him and later compelled him to reapply for membership. After serving a two-year jail sentence, Dirlewanger was released. Soon after, he was arrested again for [[sexual assault]]. He was interned in a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]. Desperate, Dirlewanger contacted [[Gottlob Berger]], an old ''Freikorps'' comrade who worked closely with [[Heinrich Himmler]], the head of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]].

A confirmation of Hitler's order was sent specifying that the poachers should where possible be Bavarian and Austrian, not be guilty of crimes involving [[Animal trapping|trap setting]], and were to be enrolled in [[Sch\u00fctzenverein|marksmen's rifle corps]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|pages=98\u201399|last= Ingrao|first= Christian|title=The SS Dirlewanger Brigade \u2013 The History of the Black Hunters|year=2011|publisher= Skyhorse Publishing|isbn=978-1620876312}}</ref> The men were to combine their knowledge of hunting and [[woodcraft]] similar to traditional [[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]] elite riflemen with the courage and initiative of those who willingly broke the law. In late May 1940 Dirlewanger was sent to [[Oranienburg]] to take charge of 80 selected men convicted of poaching crimes who were temporarily released from their sentences. After two months training, 55 men were selected with the rest sent back to prison. On 14 June 1940, the ''Wilddiebkommando Oranienburg'' (\"Oranienburg Poacher's Unit\") was formed as part of the ''Waffen-SS''.<ref name=\"Stein\" /> Himmler made Dirlewanger its commander. The unit was sent to Poland where it was joined by four Waffen-SS NCOs selected for their previous disciplinary records and twenty other recruits. By September 1940, the formation numbered over 300 men. Dirlewanger was appointed an SS-''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' by Himmler. With the influx of criminals, the emphasis on poachers was now lost, though many of the former poachers rose to NCO ranks to train the unit.  Those convicted of other more severe crimes, including the criminally insane, also joined the unit.<ref name=\"bloodlands242\" />\n\nFrom the beginning the formation attracted criticism from both the Nazi Party and the SS for the idea that convicted criminals who were forbidden to carry arms, therefore then exempt from conscription in the [[Wehrmacht]], could be a part of the elite SS. A solution was found where it was proclaimed that the formation was not part of the SS, but under control of the SS.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weale|first=Adrian|isbn=978-0349117522|title=The SS: A New History|publisher= Hachette UK|year= 2010|page=}}</ref> Within a couple of years, the unit had grown into a band of common criminals. Accordingly, the unit name was changed to ''Sonderkommando Dirlewanger'' (\"Special Unit Dirlewanger\"). As the unit strength grew, it was placed under the command of the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (the formation responsible for the administration of the [[concentration camp]]s) and redesignated as the ''SS-Sonderbataillon Dirlewanger''.<ref name=\"Williamson\" /> In January 1942, to rebuild its strength, the unit was authorised to recruit [[Russia]]n and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] volunteers. By February 1943 the number of men in the battalion doubled to 700 (half of them ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'').<ref name=\"Stein\" /> It became a Waffen-SS unit again in late 1944.\n\nAlthough other ''[[Strafbataillon]]s'' were raised as the war proceeded and the need for further manpower grew, these [[penal military unit]]s were for those convicted of military offences, whereas the recruits sent to Dirlewanger Brigade were convicted of major crimes such as [[premeditated murder]], rape, arson and burglary. Dirlewanger provided them with an opportunity to commit atrocities on such a scale that it even raised complaints within the brutal SS.<ref name=\"Stein\" /> The historian [[Martin Windrow]] described them as a \"terrifying rabble\" of \"cut-throats, renegades, sadistic morons, and cashiered rejects from other units\".<ref name=\"Windrow-Mason\">{{cite book|last= Windrow, Francis K.

The ''Dirlewanger'' resumed so-called anti-partisan activities in this area, working in cooperation with the [[S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A.|Kaminski Brigade]], a Russian militia under the command of [[Bronislav Kaminski]]. Dirlewanger's preferred method of operation was to gather civilians in a barn, set it on fire and shoot with machine guns anyone who tried to escape; the victims of his unit numbered about 30,000.<ref name=\"bloodlands242\"/>\n\nAccording to the historian [[Timothy Snyder]]:\n{{quote|As it inflicted its first fifteen thousand mortal casualties, the Special Commando Dirlewanger lost only ninety-two men \u2014 many of them, no doubt, to friendly fire and alcoholic accidents.

Recruits were to come from criminals, Eastern volunteers (''[[Osttruppen]]'') and military delinquents. The second battalion was established in February 1943 when the regiment's strength reached 700 men, of whom 300 were [[anti-communist]]s from Soviet territory; and the unit was redesignated as the ''SS-Sonderregiment Dirlewanger''. In May 1943, the eligibility to volunteer for service in the regiment was extended to all criminals and as a result 500 men convicted of the most severe crimes were absorbed into the regiment. May and June saw the unit taking part in [[Operation Cottbus]], an anti-partisan operation. In August 1943, the creation of a third battalion was authorised. With its expansion, the ''Dirlewanger'' was allowed to display rank insignia and a unique collar patch (at first crossed rifles, later crossed [[Model 24 grenade|stick grenades]]). During this period, the regiment saw heavy fighting; Dirlewanger himself led many assaults.\n\nIn November 1943, the regiment was committed to front-line action with [[Army Group Centre]] in an attempt to halt the Soviet advance, and suffered extreme casualties due to ineptitude. Dirlewanger received the German Gold Cross on 5 December 1943 in recognition of his earnestness, but by 30 December 1943, the unit consisted of only 259 men. Large numbers of amnestied criminals were sent to rebuild the regiment and by late February 1944, the regiment was back up to full strength. It was decided that Eastern volunteers would no longer be admitted to the unit, as the Russians had proven to be particularly unreliable in combat. Anti-partisan operations continued until June 1944, when the Soviets launched [[Operation Bagration]], which was aimed at the destruction of Army Group Centre. The ''Dirlewanger'' was caught up in the retreat and began falling back to Poland. The regiment sustained heavy casualties during several [[rearguard]] actions but reached Poland.\n\n===Return to Poland===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-97906, Warschauer Aufstand, Stra\u00dfenkampf (2).jpg|thumb|250px| Members of the SS-Sturmbrigade \"Dirlewanger\" in [[\u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie, Warsaw|central Warsaw]] in 1944]]\n[[File:Victims of Wola Massacre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Polish civilians murdered in the [[Wola massacre]].

During this time, the regiment was upgraded to [[brigade]] status, and named ''SS-Sonderbrigade Dirlewanger'' (SS Special Brigade Dirlewanger). In early October, it was decided to upgrade the ''Dirlewanger'' again, this time to a Waffen-SS combat brigade. Accordingly, it was redesignated ''2. SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger'' in December 1944,<ref name=\"Williamson\" /> and had soon reached its complement of 4,000 men.\n\n===Slovakia and Hungary===\nWhen the [[Slovak National Uprising]] began in late August 1944, the newly formed brigade was committed to action. The brigade played a large part in putting down the rebellion by 30 October. With the outcome of the war no longer in doubt, large numbers of communist and [[socialism|socialist]] political prisoners began applying to join the ''Dirlewanger'' in the hope of [[defection|defecting]] to the Soviets.<ref>{{in lang|de}} Klausch, Hans-Peter \u2013 ''Antifaschisten in SS-Uniform: Schicksal und Widerstand der deutschen politischen KZ-Haftlinge, Zuchthaus- und Wehrmachtstrafgefangenen in der SS-Sonderformation Dirlewanger''</ref> SS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]'' [[Fritz Schmedes]], disgraced former commander of the [[4th SS Polizei Division]], was assigned to the ''Dirlewanger'' by Himmler as punishment for refusing to carry out orders. With his extensive combat experience, Schmedes became the unofficial advisor to Dirlewanger on front line combat.\n\nIn December, the brigade was sent to the front in Hungary. While several newly formed battalions made up of communist and socialist volunteers fell apart, several other battalions fought well.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} During a month's fighting, the brigade suffered heavy casualties and was pulled back to Slovakia to refit and reorganize.\n\n===Germany===\nIn February 1945, orders were given to expand the brigade to a division; however, before this could begin it was sent north to the [[Oder-Neisse line]] in an attempt to halt the Soviet advance. On 14 February 1945, the brigade was redesignated as the ''36. Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS''.<ref name=\"Williamson\" /> With its expansion to a division of 4,000 men, the ''Dirlewanger'' had regular Army units attached to the formation: a [[Grenadier]] regiment, a ''[[Combat engineering|Pionier]]'' brigade and a ''[[Panzerj\u00e4ger]]'' battalion. Individual ''Sturmpionier'' [[demolition]] engineers had already been attached to the force during the fighting in Warsaw.\n\nWhen the final Soviet offensive began on 16 April 1945, the division was pushed back to the northeast. The next day, Oskar Dirlewanger was seriously wounded in combat for the twelfth time. He was removed from the front and he was sent to the rear and Schmedes immediately assumed command; Dirlewanger would not return to the division. Desertion became more and more common; when Schmedes attempted to reorganize his division on 25 April, he found it had virtually ceased to exist. On 28 April 1945, SS-''Sturmbannf\u00fchrer'' Ewald Ehlers, who commanded the 73rd Waffen Grenadier Regiment of the SS within the Dirlewanger Brigade, was hanged by his own men. He had been a former commandant of [[Dachau concentration camp]] who had been convicted of corruption. On 1 May 1945, the Soviets wiped out all that was left of the ''36. Waffen-Grenadier-Division'' in the [[Battle of Halbe|Halbe Pocket]]. The small remnant of the division that managed an escape attempt to reach the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] lines on the [[Elbe river]]. Schmedes and his staff managed to reach the Americans and surrendered on 3 May.\n\nOnly about 700 men of the division survived the war.

Several commanders attempted to remove Dirlewanger from command and dissolve the unit but he was protected by powerful patrons within the Nazi apparatus who intervened on his behalf. Amongst other actions, the unit took part in the [[destruction of Warsaw]] and the massacre of around 100,000 of the city's inhabitants during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] as well as the brutal suppression of the [[Slovak National Uprising]] in 1944. \n\n==Oskar Dirlewanger==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S73495, Oskar Dirlewanger.jpg|thumb|Oskar Dirlewanger in 1944]]\n{{Main|Oskar Dirlewanger}}\nThe Dirlewanger Brigade is associated with its commander, Oskar Dirlewanger, a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] called the most evil man in the SS.<ref name=\"Bishop\" /> After receiving the [[Iron Cross]] first and second class while serving in the [[Army of W\u00fcrttemberg]] during [[World War I]], Dirlewanger joined the ''[[Freikorps]]'' and took part in the crushing of the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]]. He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1923. After graduation from [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Citizens' University]], Dirlewanger worked at a bank and a knitwear factory. He became a violent alcoholic, and in 1934 was convicted of the [[statutory rape]] of a [[Minor (law)|14-year-old girl]] and stealing government property. The Nazi Party expelled him and later compelled him to reapply for membership. After serving a two-year jail sentence, Dirlewanger was released. Soon after, he was arrested again for [[sexual assault]]. He was interned in a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]. Desperate, Dirlewanger contacted [[Gottlob Berger]], an old ''Freikorps'' comrade who worked closely with [[Heinrich Himmler]], the head of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Berger secured his friend's release, after which he travelled to Spain to enlist in the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]]. He later transferred to the [[Condor Legion]], a German unit which fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939) for [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s ''[[Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista|Falange Espa\u00f1ola]]''.<ref name=\"Stein\" />\n\nAfter returning to Germany in 1939, Dirlewanger joined the ''[[Allgemeine SS]]'' (General-SS) with the rank of SS-''[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]''. In mid-1940, after the [[invasion of Poland]], Berger arranged for Dirlewanger to train a partisan-hunting military unit under his own control, composed of men convicted of [[poaching]].<ref name=\"Bishop\">\nChris Bishop, Michael Williams, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iqWZov065T4C&lpg=PA92&ots=w90SBSYmZV&dq=%22MOST%20EVIL%20MAN%20IN%20THE%20SS%22&pg=PA92#v=onepage&q=%22MOST%20EVIL%20MAN%20IN%20THE%20SS%22&f=false  ''SS: Hell on the Western Front''.] Zenith Imprint, 2003, p. 92. {{ISBN|0-7603-1402-0}}.\n</ref><ref name=\"Stein\">\nStein, George H.

A confirmation of Hitler's order was sent specifying that the poachers should where possible be Bavarian and Austrian, not be guilty of crimes involving [[Animal trapping|trap setting]], and were to be enrolled in [[Sch\u00fctzenverein|marksmen's rifle corps]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|pages=98\u201399|last= Ingrao|first= Christian|title=The SS Dirlewanger Brigade \u2013 The History of the Black Hunters|year=2011|publisher= Skyhorse Publishing|isbn=978-1620876312}}</ref> The men were to combine their knowledge of hunting and [[woodcraft]] similar to traditional [[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]] elite riflemen with the courage and initiative of those who willingly broke the law. In late May 1940 Dirlewanger was sent to [[Oranienburg]] to take charge of 80 selected men convicted of poaching crimes who were temporarily released from their sentences. After two months training, 55 men were selected with the rest sent back to prison. On 14 June 1940, the ''Wilddiebkommando Oranienburg'' (\"Oranienburg Poacher's Unit\") was formed as part of the ''Waffen-SS''.<ref name=\"Stein\" /> Himmler made Dirlewanger its commander. The unit was sent to Poland where it was joined by four Waffen-SS NCOs selected for their previous disciplinary records and twenty other recruits. By September 1940, the formation numbered over 300 men. Dirlewanger was appointed an SS-''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' by Himmler. With the influx of criminals, the emphasis on poachers was now lost, though many of the former poachers rose to NCO ranks to train the unit.  Those convicted of other more severe crimes, including the criminally insane, also joined the unit.<ref name=\"bloodlands242\" />\n\nFrom the beginning the formation attracted criticism from both the Nazi Party and the SS for the idea that convicted criminals who were forbidden to carry arms, therefore then exempt from conscription in the [[Wehrmacht]], could be a part of the elite SS. A solution was found where it was proclaimed that the formation was not part of the SS, but under control of the SS.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weale|first=Adrian|isbn=978-0349117522|title=The SS: A New History|publisher= Hachette UK|year= 2010|page=}}</ref> Within a couple of years, the unit had grown into a band of common criminals. Accordingly, the unit name was changed to ''Sonderkommando Dirlewanger'' (\"Special Unit Dirlewanger\"). As the unit strength grew, it was placed under the command of the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (the formation responsible for the administration of the [[concentration camp]]s) and redesignated as the ''SS-Sonderbataillon Dirlewanger''.<ref name=\"Williamson\" /> In January 1942, to rebuild its strength, the unit was authorised to recruit [[Russia]]n and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] volunteers.

Dirlewanger provided them with an opportunity to commit atrocities on such a scale that it even raised complaints within the brutal SS.<ref name=\"Stein\" /> The historian [[Martin Windrow]] described them as a \"terrifying rabble\" of \"cut-throats, renegades, sadistic morons, and cashiered rejects from other units\".<ref name=\"Windrow-Mason\">{{cite book|last= Windrow, Francis K.

The ''Dirlewanger'' resumed so-called anti-partisan activities in this area, working in cooperation with the [[S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A.|Kaminski Brigade]], a Russian militia under the command of [[Bronislav Kaminski]]. Dirlewanger's preferred method of operation was to gather civilians in a barn, set it on fire and shoot with machine guns anyone who tried to escape; the victims of his unit numbered about 30,000.<ref name=\"bloodlands242\"/>\n\nAccording to the historian [[Timothy Snyder]]:\n{{quote|As it inflicted its first fifteen thousand mortal casualties, the Special Commando Dirlewanger lost only ninety-two men \u2014 many of them, no doubt, to friendly fire and alcoholic accidents.

Recruits were to come from criminals, Eastern volunteers (''[[Osttruppen]]'') and military delinquents. The second battalion was established in February 1943 when the regiment's strength reached 700 men, of whom 300 were [[anti-communist]]s from Soviet territory; and the unit was redesignated as the ''SS-Sonderregiment Dirlewanger''. In May 1943, the eligibility to volunteer for service in the regiment was extended to all criminals and as a result 500 men convicted of the most severe crimes were absorbed into the regiment. May and June saw the unit taking part in [[Operation Cottbus]], an anti-partisan operation. In August 1943, the creation of a third battalion was authorised. With its expansion, the ''Dirlewanger'' was allowed to display rank insignia and a unique collar patch (at first crossed rifles, later crossed [[Model 24 grenade|stick grenades]]). During this period, the regiment saw heavy fighting; Dirlewanger himself led many assaults.\n\nIn November 1943, the regiment was committed to front-line action with [[Army Group Centre]] in an attempt to halt the Soviet advance, and suffered extreme casualties due to ineptitude. Dirlewanger received the German Gold Cross on 5 December 1943 in recognition of his earnestness, but by 30 December 1943, the unit consisted of only 259 men. Large numbers of amnestied criminals were sent to rebuild the regiment and by late February 1944, the regiment was back up to full strength. It was decided that Eastern volunteers would no longer be admitted to the unit, as the Russians had proven to be particularly unreliable in combat. Anti-partisan operations continued until June 1944, when the Soviets launched [[Operation Bagration]], which was aimed at the destruction of Army Group Centre. The ''Dirlewanger'' was caught up in the retreat and began falling back to Poland. The regiment sustained heavy casualties during several [[rearguard]] actions but reached Poland.\n\n===Return to Poland===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-97906, Warschauer Aufstand, Stra\u00dfenkampf (2).jpg|thumb|250px| Members of the SS-Sturmbrigade \"Dirlewanger\" in [[\u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie, Warsaw|central Warsaw]] in 1944]]\n[[File:Victims of Wola Massacre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Polish civilians murdered in the [[Wola massacre]].

During this time, the regiment was upgraded to [[brigade]] status, and named ''SS-Sonderbrigade Dirlewanger'' (SS Special Brigade Dirlewanger). In early October, it was decided to upgrade the ''Dirlewanger'' again, this time to a Waffen-SS combat brigade. Accordingly, it was redesignated ''2. SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger'' in December 1944,<ref name=\"Williamson\" /> and had soon reached its complement of 4,000 men.\n\n===Slovakia and Hungary===\nWhen the [[Slovak National Uprising]] began in late August 1944, the newly formed brigade was committed to action. The brigade played a large part in putting down the rebellion by 30 October. With the outcome of the war no longer in doubt, large numbers of communist and [[socialism|socialist]] political prisoners began applying to join the ''Dirlewanger'' in the hope of [[defection|defecting]] to the Soviets.<ref>{{in lang|de}} Klausch, Hans-Peter \u2013 ''Antifaschisten in SS-Uniform: Schicksal und Widerstand der deutschen politischen KZ-Haftlinge, Zuchthaus- und Wehrmachtstrafgefangenen in der SS-Sonderformation Dirlewanger''</ref> SS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]'' [[Fritz Schmedes]], disgraced former commander of the [[4th SS Polizei Division]], was assigned to the ''Dirlewanger'' by Himmler as punishment for refusing to carry out orders. With his extensive combat experience, Schmedes became the unofficial advisor to Dirlewanger on front line combat.\n\nIn December, the brigade was sent to the front in Hungary. While several newly formed battalions made up of communist and socialist volunteers fell apart, several other battalions fought well.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} During a month's fighting, the brigade suffered heavy casualties and was pulled back to Slovakia to refit and reorganize.\n\n===Germany===\nIn February 1945, orders were given to expand the brigade to a division; however, before this could begin it was sent north to the [[Oder-Neisse line]] in an attempt to halt the Soviet advance. On 14 February 1945, the brigade was redesignated as the ''36. Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS''.<ref name=\"Williamson\" /> With its expansion to a division of 4,000 men, the ''Dirlewanger'' had regular Army units attached to the formation: a [[Grenadier]] regiment, a ''[[Combat engineering|Pionier]]'' brigade and a ''[[Panzerj\u00e4ger]]'' battalion. Individual ''Sturmpionier'' [[demolition]] engineers had already been attached to the force during the fighting in Warsaw.\n\nWhen the final Soviet offensive began on 16 April 1945, the division was pushed back to the northeast. The next day, Oskar Dirlewanger was seriously wounded in combat for the twelfth time. He was removed from the front and he was sent to the rear and Schmedes immediately assumed command; Dirlewanger would not return to the division. Desertion became more and more common; when Schmedes attempted to reorganize his division on 25 April, he found it had virtually ceased to exist. On 28 April 1945, SS-''Sturmbannf\u00fchrer'' Ewald Ehlers, who commanded the 73rd Waffen Grenadier Regiment of the SS within the Dirlewanger Brigade, was hanged by his own men. He had been a former commandant of [[Dachau concentration camp]] who had been convicted of corruption. On 1 May 1945, the Soviets wiped out all that was left of the ''36. Waffen-Grenadier-Division'' in the [[Battle of Halbe|Halbe Pocket]]. The small remnant of the division that managed an escape attempt to reach the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] lines on the [[Elbe river]]. Schmedes and his staff managed to reach the Americans and surrendered on 3 May.\n\nOnly about 700 men of the division survived the war.
