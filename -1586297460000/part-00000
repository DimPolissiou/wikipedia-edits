[[Dawah|Dai]] [[Hassan-i Sabbah]], who had studied and accepted Ismailism in Fatimid Egypt, had been made aware of this fact personally by al-Mustansir. After Al-Mustansir died in 1094, [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah]], the all-powerful Armenian Vizier and Commander of the Armies, wanted to assert, like his father before him, dictatorial rule over the Fatimid State. Al-Afdal engineered a [[palace coup]], placing his brother-in-law, the much younger and dependent [[Al-Musta'li]], on the Fatimid throne. Al-Afdal claimed that Al-Mustansir had made a deathbed decree in favour of Musta'li and thus got the Ismaili leaders of the Fatimid Court and Fatimid Dawa in [[Cairo]], the capital city of the Fatimids, to endorse Musta'li, which they did, realizing that the army was behind the palace coup.<ref name=Daftary>{{cite book|last1=Daftary|first1=Farhad|title=A Short History Of The Ismailis: Traditions of a Muslim Community|date=1998|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, UK|isbn=0748609040|page=}}</ref>{{rp|p:106\u2013107}}\n\nIn early 1095, Nizar fled to [[Alexandria]], where he received the people's support and where he was accepted as the next Fatimid Caliph-Imam after Al-Mustansir, with gold [[dinars]] being minted in Alexandria in Nizar's name (one such coin, found in 1994, is in the collection of the [[Aga Khan Museum]]). In late 1095, Al-Afdal defeated Nizar's Alexandrian army and took Nizar prisoner to Cairo where he had Nizar executed.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:107}}\n\nAfter Nizar's execution, the Nizari Ismailis and the [[Musta'li]] Ismailis parted ways in a bitterly irreconcilable manner. The schism finally broke the remnants of the Fatimid Empire, and the now-divided Ismailis separated into the Musta'li following (inhabiting regions of Egypt, Yemen, and western India) and those pledging allegiance to Nizar's son [[Al-Hadi ibn Nizar]] (living in regions of Iran and [[Syria]]). The latter Ismaili following came to be known as ''Nizari Ismailism''.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:106\u2013107}}\n\nImam Al-Hadi, being very young at the time, was smuggled out of Alexandria and taken to the Nizari stronghold of [[Alamut]] Fort in the [[Elburz Mountains]] of northern Iran, south of the [[Caspian Sea]] and under the regency of Dai [[Hasan bin Sabbah]].\n\nThe offshoot of these Muhammad-Shahi Nizari Ismailis recognize the elder son of Shamsu-d-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad, the 28th Qasim-Shahi Imam, named ''Al\u0101'' ad-D\u012bn Mumin Sh\u0101h (the 26th Imam of the Muhammad-Shahi Nizari Ismailis). They recogninze this line of Imams down to the disappearance of the 40th Imam, Amir Muhammad al-Baqir, in 1796. There are followers of this line of Nizari Imams in Syria today, locally called the Jafariyah.\n\n{{See also|List of Ismaili Imams}}\n\n===Origin of the Fidai===\nFollowers of the young Imam Hadi who wished to be fighters were trained as [[Fidai]], whose bravery and self-sacrificing spirituality was due to their belief that the Nizari ''Imam-ul-waqt'' (\"Imam of the time\") had the ''[[N\u016br (Islam)|noor]]'' (light) of God within him. As such it became a religious duty for the Fidai to obey every dictate of their ''Imam-ul-waqt'' and to protect him and their community of believers without compromise even to the extent of dying for their cause.\n\nUnder [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] in Iran, and [[Rashid ad-Din Sinan]] in Syria, the Nizari Fidai targeted the most powerful enemy leaders faced by these new Nizari Ismaili communities in the Elburz Mountains of northern Iran and in the mountains of the [[Levant]]ine coast, the [[Jabal Bahra]], overlooking the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]].\n\nThe Fidai were feared as the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], but did not [[assassinate]] for payment. Although they were trained in the art of [[spying]] and [[combat]], they also practiced Islamic [[mysticism]] at the highest level. This religious ardor turned them into formidable foes, as in the anecdote of [[Count Henry of Champagne]]. Returning from [[Armenia]], Henry spoke with Grand Master [[Rashid ad-Din Sinan]] (known to [[Western world|the West]] as \"The Old Man of the Mountain\") at one of his castles, [[Al-Kahf Castle|al-Kahf]], in Syria. Henry pointed out that since his army was bigger by far than Sinan's, Sinan should pay him an annual tribute.\n\nSinan refused, asserting that his army was far stronger, in spirit and unquestioning obedience if not in numbers. He invited Henry to witness this obedience and sacrificial spirit of his Fidai. Sinan signalled to a Fidai standing on the parapet of a high wall of his castle, to jump. The Fidai called out \"[[Takbir|God is Great]]\" and unhesitatingly took a headlong death dive into the rocks far below.\n\nThe bewildered Henry asked Sinan the cause for the suicidal jump. Sinan pointed once again to the Fidai who had taken the place of the now dead Fidai. Again Sinan gave a signal to the Fidai to jump and the second Fidai also called out \"God is Great\" and jumped to his death. Henry was visibly shaken by the experience of witnessing the two Fidais' total disregard for their own lives. He accepted Sinan's terms of peace on a non-tribute-paying basis. The Nizaris thus averted debilitating wars against them because of their Fidais' feats of self-sacrifice and assassinations of powerful enemy leaders to demonstrate the will and commitment of the community to live free from being a vassal to any Levantine power.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|authorlink1=Bernard Lewis|title=[[The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam]]|date=1967|isbn=9780465004980}}</ref>{{rp|p:25}}\n\nThe Fidai were some of the most feared assassins in the then known world.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:120\u2013158}}<ref name=\"Nowell 1947\">{{cite journal |first=Charles E. |last= Nowell |title= The Old Man of the Mountain |journal=Speculum |volume=22 |issue=4 |year=1947}}</ref> Sinan ordered assassinations against politicians and generals such as the great Kurdish general and founder of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]], [[Saladin]]. A sleeping Saladin had a note from Sinan delivered to him by a Fidai planted in his entourage. The note was pinned to his pillow with a dagger, and it informed Saladin that he had been spared this once and should give up his anti-Nizari militancy. A shaken Saladin quickly made a truce with Sinan.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:144}}\n\nSubsequently, the Fidai aided the Muslim cause against the Christian [[Crusaders]] of the [[Third Crusade]] which included [[Richard the Lion Heart]] of England. Saladin having by now established a friendly relationship with Sinan, the Nizari Fidai themselves joined Saladin's forces to defeat the Crusaders in the last great battle between the two forces. Later on, when \"the Nizaris faced renewed [[Crusades|Frankish]] hostilities, they received timely assistance from the Ayyubids\".<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:146}}\n\nThe Fidais' apparent lack of fear of personal injury or even death could not be understood by the Crusaders, who propagated the black legends of the so-called [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]]. According to Daftary, these were \"fictions ... meant to provide satisfactory explanations for behavior that would otherwise seem strange to the medieval Western mind\".<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:14}} These black legends were then further popularized in the Western world by [[Marco Polo]], the Venetian storyteller who had, in fact, never investigated Sinan, in contradiction to his claim that he had. Polo asserted that Sinan fed [[hashish]] to his drugged followers, the so-called ''Hashishins'' (Assassins), so as to fortify them with the type of courage to commit the assassinations of the most intrepid kind.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:14}}\n\nThis tale of the \"Old Man of the Mountain\" was assembled by Marco Polo and accepted by [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]], a 19th-century [[Austria]]n [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] responsible for much of the spread of this legend. Until the 1930s, Hammer-Purgstall's retelling of Marco Polo's fiction served as the standard description of the Nizari Ismailis across Europe. \"The [[Russia]]n orientalist [[Vladimir Alexeyevich Ivanov]] ... gained access also to Nizari literature preserved in Central Asia, Persia, Afghanistan and elsewhere ... compiled the first detailed catalogue of (Nizari and Fatimid) Ismaili works, citing some 700 separate titles attesting to the hitherto unknown richness and diversity of (Nizari and Fatimid) Ismaili literature and literary traditions\".<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:17}}\n\n===Succession===\n{{Main|Hadith of the pond of Khumm}}\n{{see also|Wikisource:The Last Sermon of Muhammad}}\n\nAs with all [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], the [[Succession to Muhammad|succession of leadership]] following the death of the prophet Muhammed is of major importance to Nizaris. Nizaris believe that at [[Event of Ghadir Khumm|al-Ghadir Khumm]], by God's direct command, Muhammad designated his cousin and son-in-law [[Ali]]\u2014the husband of his daughter [[Fatimah]]\u2014as his successor. As such, Ali became the spiritual successor and the first Imam in the continuing line of hereditary Imams that leads up to the present 49th imam [[Aga Khan IV|Prince Shah Karim Al Hussaini]].\n\nThe Nizari Ismaili tradition is unique in that it is the only tradition that has this continuity of hereditary divine authority vested in the Imamim-Mubeen. In all the Sunni traditions, the Imamim-Mubeen is interpreted as the Quran itself; and in all the Shia traditions, except the Shia Nizari, the Imamim-Mubeen is the last Imam of a dynasty that went into [[occultation (Islam)|occultation]]. However, in Nizari Ismailism, the Imamim-Mubeen is a living human Imam who is never in occultation, who will never ever be absent from this world but will always be perpetually present and physically alive, and who is designated as the inheritor of an Imamate passed down from father to son. This tradition has continued for almost 1400 years.\n\n===Further schisms===\nThe Ismailis and the Twelvers split over the succession to Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]. Ismailis contend that Jafar had designated his son [[Isma'il ibn Jafar]] as his heir and the next Imam in the hereditary line, and thus the Isma'ilis follow the Imamate of Isma'il and his progeny. Although Imam Ismail predeceased his father, Isma'il supposedly had designated his own son Muhammad ibn Ismail as the next hereditary Imam to follow. In opposition to this belief, the Twelvers believe that Imam Ismail's younger brother [[Musa al Kadhim]] was, from the beginning, the rightful successor to Imam Jafar and that Ismail was never a contender.\n\nThe Nizari Ismailis have since split from others, initially from the [[Qarmatians]], [[Druze]], [[Musta'li]] Ismailis, Muhammad Shahi Nizari Ismailis, and [[Satpanth]]is, the last two splitting from the Nizari branch of Ismailism in the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nThe ''Nizari Ismailis'' have always maintained that the [[Imamate|Imamah]] (also known as 'Imamat') can only be inherited from the current Imam to a direct descendant in a father-to-son (or grandson) ''hereditary lineage'' starting with Imam Ali and then to Imam Hussain and so on until their present and living 49th Imam, [[Aga Khan IV|Prince Karim al-Husayni Aga Khan IV]].\n\nThe Nizaris regard Hassan bin (son of) Ali as a Trustee Imam (imam al-mustawda) as opposed to a Hereditary Imam (imam al-mustaqarr). This fact is clearly demonstrated in the recitation of the Nizari Ismailis\u2019 daily prayers three times a day in which although Hassan bin Ali is revered as part of the Prophet's personal family (Ahl al-Bayt), his name is not included in the [[List of Ismaili imams|hereditary lineage]]<ref>Daftary, Farhad (1990).

If Hassan bin Ali's name were to be included as one of the Ismaili Imams in their prayer recitation then the present Imam Prince Karim of the Nizari Ismailis would have to be the 50th Imam and not the 49th Imam - the way he has identified himself and is known to the world.\n\n==Contemporary history==\n{{Main|Aga Khan IV}}\n\nAll Niz\u0101r\u012b Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs now accept Prince Shah Karim Al-Husayni, the [[Aga Khan IV]], as their Im\u0101m-i-Zaman (Imam of the Time). He is referred to in Persian as ''Khudawand'' (Lord of the Time), in Arabic as ''Maulana'' (Master) or ''H\u0101zar Im\u0101m'' (Present Imam). Karim succeeded his grandfather Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah [[Aga Khan III]] as Im\u0101m in 1957, when he was just 20 and still an undergraduate at Harvard University. He was referred to as \"the Imam of the [[Atomic Age]]\". The period following his accession can be characterized as one of rapid political and economic change. Planning of programs and institutions became increasingly difficult due to the rapid changes in the newly emerging post-colonial nations where many of his followers resided. Upon becoming Im\u0101m, Karim's immediate concern was the preparation of his followers, wherever they lived, for the changes that lay ahead. This rapidly evolving situation called for bold initiatives and new programs to reflect developing national aspirations in the newly independent nations.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:206\u2013209}}\n\nIn Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, a major objective of the community's social welfare and economic programs, until the mid-1950s, had been to create a broad base of businessmen, agriculturists, and professionals. The educational facilities of the community tended to emphasize secondary-level education. With the coming of independence, each nation's economic aspirations took on new dimensions, focusing on industrialization and the modernization of agriculture. The community's educational priorities had to be reassessed in the context of new national goals, and new institutions had to be created to respond to the growing complexity of the development process.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1972, under the regime of the then President [[Idi Amin]], Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs and other Asians were expelled from Uganda, despite being citizens of the country and having lived there for generations. The Imam took urgent steps to facilitate the resettlement of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs displaced from Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, and also from Burma. Owing to his personal efforts, most found homes, not only in Asia, but also in Europe and North America. Most of the basic resettlement problems were overcome remarkably rapidly. This was due to the adaptability of the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs themselves\u2014helped in particular by their education\u2014their linguistic abilities, the efforts of the host countries, and the moral and material support from Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b community programs.\n\nIn view of the importance that Isl\u0101m places on maintaining a balance between the spiritual well-being of the individual and the quality of his life, the Im\u0101m's guidance deals with both aspects of the life of his followers. The Aga Khan has encouraged Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b Muslims settled in the industrialized world to contribute towards the progress of communities in the developing world through various development programs. ''[[The Economist]]'' noted that Isma'ili immigrant communities integrated seamlessly as immigrant communities, and did better at attaining graduate and post-graduate degrees, \"far surpassing their native, Hindu, Sikh, fellow Muslims, and Chinese communities\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Economist: Islam, America and Europe |date=June 22, 2006 |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited |location=London, UK}}</ref>\n\n===Silver Jubilee===\nFrom July 1982 to July 1983, to celebrate the present Aga Khan's Silver Jubilee marking the 25th anniversary of his accession to the Imamate, many new social and economic development projects were launched. These ranged from the establishment of the US$450&nbsp;million international [[Aga Khan University]] with its Faculty of Health Sciences and [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi|teaching hospital]] based in Karachi; the expansion of [[Aga Khan Education Services|schools]] for girls and [[Aga Khan Health Services|medical centers]] in the [[Hunza Valley|Hunza region]], one of the remote parts of Northern Pakistan bordering on China and Afghanistan; the establishment of the Aga Khan Rural Support Program in [[Gujarat]], India; and the extension of existing urban hospitals and primary health care centers in [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]]. These initiatives form part of an international network of institutions involved in fields that range from education, health, and rural development, to architecture and the promotion of private sector enterprise and together make up the [[Aga Khan Development Network]].\n\n===Golden Jubilee===\nFrom 2007 to 2008, during the Golden Jubilee marking 50 years of his Imamate, the Aga Khan commissioned a number of projects: renowned [[Pritzker Prize]] winning Japanese architect [[Fumihiko Maki]] was commissioned to design a new kind of community structure, resembling an embassy, in Ottawa, Canada; and the [[Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat]], to be composed of two large interconnected spaces an atrium and a courtyard, opened on 8 December 2008. The atrium is an interior space, to be used all year round. It is protected by a unique glass dome made of multi-faceted, angular planes assembled to create the effect of rock crystal; the Aga Khan asked Maki to consider the qualities of \"rock crystal\", which was valued by the Imams of the Fatimid Empire, in his design. Within the glass dome is an inner layer of woven glass-fibre fabric which will appear to float and hover over the atrium. The delegation building is located on Sussex Drive near the Canadian parliament. Future delegation buildings are planned for other capitals, beginning with Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nIn addition to primary and secondary schools, the Aga Khan academies, were set up to educate future leaders in the developing world. The Aga Khan Museum\u2014which will open in Toronto, Canada\u2014will be the first museum in the West dedicated to Islamic civilization. Due to be completed in 2013, it will be dedicated to the \"acquisition, preservation and display of artefacts \u2013 from various periods and geographies \u2013 relating to the intellectual, cultural, artistic and religious heritage of Islamic communities\". A series of new Isma'ili centres are underway: including in Toronto, Ontario; Houston, Texas; Dushanbe and the Pamir, Tajikistan.\n\n===Diamond Jubilee===\nDuring 2017\u20132018 the Ismaili Muslim community commemorated 60 years since the Aga Khan became the 49th hereditary Imam on 11 July 1957. The Diamond Jubilee was a celebration of the Imam's vision and tireless work, which have steered the Ismaili community through 60 years of changes that posed social, political, and economic challenges.\n\n===Seat of the Ismaili Imamate===\nFollowing a historic agreement with the [[Republic of Portugal]] in 2015, on 11 July 2018, the Aga Khan officially designated the Henrique de Mendon\u00e7a Palace, located on Rua Marqu\u00eas de Fronteira in [[Lisbon]], as the seat of the Ismaili Imamate, the \"[[Divan|Diwan]] of the Ismaili Imamat\".<ref>[https://ismaili.imamat/ Ismaili Imamat]</ref>\n\n==Theology==\n{{Aqidah|Shia}}\n\n===God===\n{{Main|God in Islam}}\n\nNizari Ismaili theology is the pre-eminent negative or [[apophatic theology]] of Islam because it affirms the absolute Oneness of God (''[[tawhid]]'') through negating all names, descriptions, conceptions, and limitations from God. The Ismaili theology of tawhid goes back to the teachings of the early Shi\u2018a Imams, especially Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (d. 661), Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (d. 743), and Imam Ja\u2018far al-Sadiq (d. 765). Additionally, a number of eminent Ismaili Muslim philosophers\u2014Abu Ya\u2018qub al-Sjistani (d. 971), Ja\u2018far ibn Mansur al-Yaman (d. 960), Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani (d. 1021), al-Mu\u2019ayyad al-Din Shirazi (d. 1077), Nasir-i Khusraw (d. 1088), Abd al-Karim al-Shahrastani (d. 1153), Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (d. 1273)\u2014consolidated and refined the Ismaili theology of tawhid using the strongest philosophical arguments of their time. Even in the present age, Imam Shah Karim al-Husayni Aga Khan IV, the present and 49th hereditary Imam of the Shi\u2018a Ismaili Muslims, continues to stress the absolute and utter transcendence of God. At the 1975 All-Ismailia Paris Conference, the Ismaili Imam endorsed and approved the following resolution concerning the contemporary Ismaili position on the concept of God:\n\n<blockquote>The absolute transcendence of God to be emphasized, and the Ismaili belief in God to be expounded in association with the general stress on the transcendence of God in the Qur\u2019an, as exemplified particularly in the Surat al-Ikhlas.<ref>Paris Conference Report, ed. Eqbal Rupani, Paris: 1975, 6</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Ismaili Concept of tawhid can be summarized as follows:<ref>{{cite web |last=Ismaili Gnostic |title=Ismaili Teachings on the Oneness of God (Tawhid): Beyond Personalist Theism and Modern Atheism |url=https://ismailignosis.com/2016/01/22/ismaili-teachings-on-the-oneness-of-god-tawhid-beyond-personalist-theism-and-modern-atheism/ |date=22 January 2016 |website=Ismaili Gnosis |access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n*God is beyond all names and attributes (including every name and attribute mentioned in the Qur\u2019an, such as the Powerful, the Living, the First, the Last, etc.);\n*God is beyond matter, energy, space, time and change;\n*God is beyond all human conceptions of the imagination and intellect;\n*God is beyond both positive and negative qualities\u2014He is not knowing and not not knowing and He is not powerful and not not powerful;\n*God is beyond all philosophical and metaphysical categories\u2014spiritual/material, cause/effect, eternal/temporal, substance/accident, essence/attributes, and existence/essence\u2014God is above existence and non-existence;\n*When God is associated with a name or attribute in scripture, ritual or everyday speech, e.g. \"God is knowing\", the real meaning of this statement is that God is the source and originator of that power or quality, i.e. God is the originator of all knowledge but He Himself is beyond actually possessing knowledge as an attribute;\n*God's Creative Act is called His Word or Command\u2014this Command is a single, eternal, and continuous act which continually gives existence to and sustains all created or conditioned realities in every moment of their existence.\n\nThe full recognition of tawhid, in a mode beyond human rational discourse, is a spiritual and mystical realization in the human soul and intellect called ''ma'rifah''. In the Ismaili ''tariqah'' of Islam, the ma\u2018rifah of the tawhid of God is attained through the Imam of the Time. The perfect soul of the Imam of the Time always experiences the fullness of the ma\u2018rifah of God and his ''murids'' reach that recognition through the recognition (ma\u2018rifah) of the Imam.<ref>Nas\u012br al-Din al-Tusi, tr. S.J. Badakhshani, Contemplation and Action, 44</ref> This is the essential role of the Imam of the time and embodied in the Ismaili Muslim daily prayer called ''[[Dua|du'a']]''. The Imam Sultan Muhammad Shah also alluded to this when he said that the \"real miracle of Hazrat Ali is that he brought people to the Truth\".\n\n===Quran===\n{{Main|Quran|Esoteric interpretation of the Quran}}\n{{See also|Quranic hermeneutics|Exegesis}}\n[[Image:Large Koran.jpg|thumb|upright=1.18|A water colour ink and gold page from a Persian Quran, 14th century]]\n\nNizaris, like all Muslims, consider the [[Quran]], the central [[religious text]] of Islam, to be the word of God.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Qur'an| encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online }}</ref> Nizaris employ ''[[tafsir]]'' (the science of Quranic commentary) for ''[[zahir (Islam)|zahir]]'', or exoteric understanding, and ''[[tawil]]'' (the Quranic poetic metre), for ''[[batin (Islam)|batin]]'', or esoteric understanding.\n\nTawil stems from the Quranic root word \"to return to\" the original meaning of the Quran. While acknowledging the importance of both, the ''zahir'' and the ''batin'' in religion, the ''batin'' informs on how the ''zahir'' is to be practiced. More importantly, the ''batin'' guides the believer on a spiritual journey of discovery of the intangible truth (''[[haqiqa]]'') that engages both the intellect (''[['aql|aql]]'') and the spirit (''[[ruh]]'') with the ultimate destination being that of gnostic enlightenment (''[[marifa]]'' or ''[[Muraqabah#Fana_fillah|fana-fillah]]'').\n\nThe word ''Quran'' means \"recitation\". When Muslims speak of \"the Quran\" in the abstract, they usually mean the scripture as recited rather than the printed work or any translation of it. For the Nizari Ismaili, the ''tafsir'' and ''tawil'' of the Quran are embodied most perfectly in the being of the ''Imam-i-Zaman'' (the Imam of the Time), due to his divinity as \"the Imam from God Himself\" as expressed in the third part of their [[Shahada]].\n\n===Pillars of Islam===\n{{main|Seven pillars of Ismailism}}\n\nIsma'ilism holds that there are [[Seven pillars of Ismailism|seven pillars in Islam]], each of which possesses both an exoteric (\"outer\" or ''zahir'') expression and an esoteric (\"inner\" or ''batin'') one.\n\nThe Foundation:\n\nIsmailis believe in the basic principle of One God, and Prophet Muhammed is the final messenger. However, they believe that Muhammed's progeny are the rightful successors of Islam, hence, they seek guidance from \"the living imam\", who is a living descendant of Muhammed's family. \n\nThe Six Pillars consist of:\n\n# [[Walayah (Ismaili and Druze pillar)|Walayah]] Guardianship ({{lang-ar|\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629}}): cultivating a pure loving, affectionate attachment to, and intimacy with, God\u2014manifested in the Prophets and the Imams by their continually offering loyalty, allegiance, devotion and obedience to God\u2014and to those who manifest divine guardianship\u2014the Prophets and Imams. For the Nizari, God is the true desire of every soul.\n# [[Taharah]] Purity ({{lang-ar|\u0637\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0629}}): physical cleanliness, keeping a hygienic home, and personal presence, but also purity of the heart and the soul.\n# [[Salat]] Prayer ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0629}}): Nizari Isma'ili, as do Imami Shia, practice the Salaah as outlined by the Ja'far\u012b ''[[madhhab]]'', the prayer being performed to mark important festivals. Nizari more generally perform a ritual ''[[Holy Du'a|du'a]]'' three times a day. The Nizari, like the Sufi, practice ''[[dhikr]]''\u2014\"remembrance\" of God, the Prophets, and the Imams\u2014which can take the form of a melodic communal chant or be performed in silence.\n# [[Zakah]] Charity ({{lang-ar|\u0632\u0643\u0627\u0629}}): voluntarily share one's own knowledge or skills, as well as tithing. Nizari are encouraged to actively volunteer in the running of community spaces, and offering their specialized knowledge to the wider community\u2014including legal, medical, or other vocational expertise. Zakah also refers to tithing\u2014Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad was designated to collect ''zak\u0101t'' from believers and it is now the duty of believers to give alms to the Im\u0101m or his representative, to be redistributed to support local and international development.\n# [[Sawm]] Fasting ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u0648\u0645}}): Fasting during the month of [[Ramadan]] and to mark the new moon is believed to be beneficial for those who are overwrought with the base ego\u2014desire, rage, and the self. Isma'ili who are following the ''tariqa'' (path) seek to transcend the base ego so as to attain an inner being that is in harmony. They absorb food as nourishment for a healthy, peaceful, body and mind, as the more important fast is that of mind and heart, where one abstains from unworthy concerns and worldly thoughts, and can be broken by succumbing to the base ego, and its insatiable desires.\n# [[Hajj]] Pilgrimage ({{lang-ar|\u062d\u062c}}): the pilgrimage to Mecca, at least once in an individual's life. For the Nizari, there is also a fuller discovery to be made regarding life. A glimpse (''deedar'') of the Imam's spirit aids them in transforming themselves into spiritual beings they cease to be ordinary people existing within the exoteric reality, but journey to and discover an inner reality of life.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/ismailis.htm | title = Isma'ilism | accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref>\n\n===Rationalism===\n{{main|Imamah (Nizari Ismaili doctrine)}}\n\nVarious rival approaches to the challenge that Greek rationalism posed to Quranic revelation permeated early Islamic society. The [[Ash'ari|Ash\u02bfaris]] considered ''[[Kalam]]'' (reason) as contradictory to Islam, and ''[[Islamic philosophy|falsafa]]'' (philosophy) as antagonistic to faith, which asserts the absolute supremacy of revelation, and the abandonment of reason in the spiritual and secular space (which are interconnected within orthodox Islam). The [[Mu'tazili]]s took a less absolutist approach, allowing for a limited role of reason (Kalam). [[Isma'ili]]s adopted an altogether more philosophical approach, in which only through reasoned discourse could one attain understanding of revelation, social structure, and individualism, as well as the functioning of the natural world. For this reason [[Isma'ili]]s produced a relatively scant collection of theological discourse in comparison to other Shia, and the Sunni. Yet they had a leading place in the development of philosophical discourse within the Islamic world.\n\nWhile Nizaris subscribe to the [[Imamate in Nizari doctrine|Imami jurisprudence]], they also follow in part the ''[[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'f\u0101riyya]]'' ''Madhhab'' (school of Jurisprudence), which is believed by Shias to have been founded by Imam [[Jafar Sadiq|Ja'far as-Sadiq]]. Nizaris adhere to supremacy of ''Kalam'' in the interpretation of scripture, and in the temporal relativism of understanding, as opposed to ''[[fiqh]]'' (traditional [[nomianism|legalism]]), which adheres to an [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]] approach to [[revelation]].\n\nFor Nizaris, there exists a dialectic between revelation and human reasoning, based on a synergy of Islamic scripture and classical Greek philosophy, in particular [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] reasoning and [[Platonism|Platonic]] metaphysics. It seeks to extend an understanding of religion and revelation to identify the outwardly apparent (''zahir''), and also to penetrate to the roots, to retrieve and disclose that which is the inner underlying (''[[Batin (Islam)|batin]]''). This process of discovery engages both the intellect (''[['aql]]'') and the spirit (''[[ruh]]''), generating an integral synergy to illuminate and disclose truths (''[[Haqiqa|haqi'qat]]'') culminating in ''[[gnosis]]'' (''[[marifa|ma'rifat]]'').\n\n==Community==\n\n===World Constitution===\n{{Main|Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b Constitution}}\n\nThe present Aga Khan continued the practice of his predecessor and gave constitutions to Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b communities in the US, Canada, several European countries, the Persian Gulf, Syria, and Iran, following a process of consultation within each constituency. In 1986, he promulgated a World Constitution that, for the first time, brought the social governance of the worldwide Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b community into a single structure with built-in flexibility to account for diverse circumstances of different regions. Served by volunteers appointed by and accountable to the Imam, the Constitution functions to enable individual creativity in an ethos of group responsibility to promote the common well-being.\n\nLike its predecessors, the present constitution is founded on adherence to the basic principles of Islam, belief in one God and Muhammad as the seal of the prophets, and on each Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b's spiritual allegiance to the Im\u0101m of the Time, which is separate from the secular allegiance that all Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs owe as citizens to their national entities. The present Imam and his predecessor emphasized every Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b's allegiance to his or her country as a fundamental obligation. These obligations are discharged not by passive affirmation but through responsible engagement and active commitment to uphold national integrity and contribute to peaceful development.\n\n===Places of Worship===\n{{Main|Jama'at Khana}}\n\n[[Jama'at Khana]] ({{lang-fa|\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u062a\u200c\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647}}, from the Arabic ''Jamaat'' (congregation) and the Persian ''Khaneh'' (house)) are Isma'ili houses of prayer, study, and community. They usually contain separate spaces for prayer and a social hall for community gatherings.\nThere are no principle architectural guidelines for Jama'at Khana, although inspiration is drawn from Islamic architecture and local architectural traditions to seamlessly and discreetly blend them with the local architectural environment, informed by a minimalist design aesthetic.\n\nLarger Jama'at Khana are referred to as ''Darkhanas'', or \"Isma'ili Centers\" in the West, and have been referred to as \"Isma'ili Cathedrals\" by observers. While containing prayer and social infrastructure albeit on a larger scale, they may also contain auditoriums and lecture spaces, libraries, offices, and council chambers, as they act as the regional or national governing centers for community administration.\n\nJama'at Khana, particularly the larger centers, offer their spaces to the community at large, and arrange guided tours. However, during the obligatory prayer (''[[Holy Du'a]]'') only Isma'ili are allowed to enter the prayer hall (''[[masjid]]'').\n\nFrom the ''Encyclopaedia of Ismailism'' by Mumtaz Ali Tajddin:\n\n<blockquote>In the Ismaili tariqah, the guardian of each Jamatkhana is called [[mukhi]] (in the South-Asian tradition) or Sheikh (in the Arab tradition) there are also other names that are applied based on the cultural context of the Jamat, mukhi is a word derived from mukhiya means foremost. Since the Imam physically is not present all the times in the Jamatkhana, the Mukhi acts [as the] tangible symbol of the Imam's authority. In the big jamat, the Mukhi was assisted by a caretaker called tha'nak. Later, the office of kamadia (from kamdar [meaning] accountant) was created. The Mukhi and Kamadia are the traditional titles going back to the pre-Aga Khan period when they enjoyed considerable local power. Their responsibilities include officiating over the daily rituals in the Jamatkhana, but they are primarily lay officials. Since the wholesale reorganizations undertaken by the Imams, the local committees are now tied into an elaborately hierarchical administrative structure of boards and councils.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Symbols===\n[[File:Ismaili colors.svg|thumb|The [[Nizari Ismaili|Niz\u0101r\u012b Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b]] flag known as \"My Flag\"]]\n\nThe Fatimids adopted Green (''akhdar'') as the colour of their standard, which symbolized their allegiance to Ali, who, in order to thwart an assassination attempt on Muhammad, once wrapped himself in a green coverlet to appear to be Muhammad. When [[Hassan I Sabbah]] captured Alamut, it is said he hoisted the green standard over the fortress, it was later reported that Hassan I Sabbah prophesied that when the Hidden Imam made himself known he would hoist a red flag, which Hasan II did during his appearance. Following the destruction of Alamut, Isma'ili hoisted both green and red flags above the tombs of their Imams. Green and Red were combined in the 19th century Isma'ili flag known as \"My Flag\".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe Fatimids also used a white standard with gold inlays, and the Caliph Imams often wore white with gold, as Isma'ili Imams do today. Isma'ili use a gold crest on white standard to symbolize the authority of Imamate, and often wear white in the presence of their Imam.\n\nThe [[heptagram]], a seven pointed star, is often used by Isma'ilis as a symbol.\n\n==Practices==\n\n===Marriage===\nMarriage (''{{'}}ur'', \u0639\u0631\u0633) is a legal wedding contract (''[[Nikah]]'',  \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0643\u0627\u062d) between a consenting adult man and a woman, and it is not considered a sacrament in Islam as it is in Christianity and other religions. As a contract, it allows both parties to add certain conditions. Nizari ideals of marriage envision a long-term union.\n\nSince marriage is not considered a sacrament, Nizari Isma'ili consider secular court marriages in the West as valid legal contracts. However many Isma'ili couples opt to have both a court marriage to secure legal recognition as well as a ''Nikah'' ceremony performed at a Jama'at Khana.\n\nUnlike many other groups, inter-faith marriages are recognized by the community. In addition to the other Abrahamic faiths, the prevalence of Nizari Ismailis of South Asian descent has resulted in growing numbers married to those of [[Dharmic faiths]], such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]], as well as other Indian religions, such as [[Sikhism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]. The [[Aga Khan IV]] has said that he has no objection to increasingly-common mixed marriages, and has met non-Ismaili spouses and children during his various ''[[deedars]]'' throughout the world. In fact, many members of his family, including his daughter [[Princess Zahra Aga Khan]], have married non-Ismailis in inter-faith ceremonies. [[Islam and children#Marriage|Child marriages]] are strictly prohibited. The Aga Khan IV also condemned [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]], except in certain circumstances.<ref>{{cite book|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|title=Historical Dictionary of the Ismailis|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|pages=113-114}}</ref>\n\n===Offerings===\n{{Main|N\u0101ndi}}\n\n''[[N\u0101ndi]]'' is a ceremony in which food is symbolically offered to the [[Imamah (Shi'a Ismaili doctrine)|Im\u0101m-e Zam\u0101n]], and is subsequently auctioned to the congregation. Money obtained is forwarded to the Imam by officials. The ceremony is conducted by volunteers from the community. The food is prepared at home and is brought to the Jama'at Khana; the [[Mukhi]] (congregation head) blesses the food offering, known as ''Mehm\u0101ni'', at the end of prayers, informing the congregation that it has been offered to the Imam and the benefits of it are for the whole Jamat. If no physical food offering has been brought to the Jama'at Khana, then a symbolic plate called the \"Mehm\u0101ni plate\", which serves as a substitute, can be touched during the ''[[Du'a Karavi]]'' ceremony.\n\nThe origins of ''N\u0101ndi'' are said to be in the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s time when a similar practice occurred.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Calendar===\nNizari use an arithmetically based lunar calendar to calculate the year, unlike most Muslim communities, which rely on visual sightings. The Isma'ili calendar was developed in the Middle Ages during the Faitmid Caliphate of Imam Al-Hakim.\n\nA lunar year contains about 354 11/30 days, Nizari Isma'ili employ a cycle of 11 leap years (''kasibah'') with 355 days in a 30-year cycle. The odd-numbered months contain 30 days and the even numbered months 29 days; the 12th and final month in a leap year contains 30 days.\n\nNizari use 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26, 29, respectively, in their calculations.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Aga Khan Development Network==\nThe Aga Khan Development Network<ref>[http://www.akdn.org Aga Khan Development Network]</ref> (AKDN) was set up by the Imamate and the Ismaili community as a group of private, non-denominational development agencies that seek to empower communities and individuals, regardless of ethnicity or religious affiliation, and seek to improve living conditions and opportunities within the developing world. It has active working relationships with international organizations such as the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the [[European Union]] (EU), and private organizations such as the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]].

[[Dawah|Dai]] [[Hassan-i Sabbah]], who had studied and accepted Ismailism in Fatimid Egypt, had been made aware of this fact personally by al-Mustansir. After Al-Mustansir died in 1094, [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah]], the all-powerful Armenian Vizier and Commander of the Armies, wanted to assert, like his father before him, dictatorial rule over the Fatimid State. Al-Afdal engineered a [[palace coup]], placing his brother-in-law, the much younger and dependent [[Al-Musta'li]], on the Fatimid throne. Al-Afdal claimed that Al-Mustansir had made a deathbed decree in favour of Musta'li and thus got the Ismaili leaders of the Fatimid Court and Fatimid Dawa in [[Cairo]], the capital city of the Fatimids, to endorse Musta'li, which they did, realizing that the army was behind the palace coup.<ref name=Daftary>{{cite book|last1=Daftary|first1=Farhad|title=A Short History Of The Ismailis: Traditions of a Muslim Community|date=1998|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, UK|isbn=0748609040|page=}}</ref>{{rp|p:106\u2013107}}\n\nIn early 1095, Nizar fled to [[Alexandria]], where he received the people's support and where he was accepted as the next Fatimid Caliph-Imam after Al-Mustansir, with gold [[dinars]] being minted in Alexandria in Nizar's name (one such coin, found in 1994, is in the collection of the [[Aga Khan Museum]]). In late 1095, Al-Afdal defeated Nizar's Alexandrian army and took Nizar prisoner to Cairo where he had Nizar executed.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:107}}\n\nAfter Nizar's execution, the Nizari Ismailis and the [[Musta'li]] Ismailis parted ways in a bitterly irreconcilable manner. The schism finally broke the remnants of the Fatimid Empire, and the now-divided Ismailis separated into the Musta'li following (inhabiting regions of Egypt, Yemen, and western India) and those pledging allegiance to Nizar's son [[Al-Hadi ibn Nizar]] (living in regions of Iran and [[Syria]]). The latter Ismaili following came to be known as ''Nizari Ismailism''.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:106\u2013107}}\n\nImam Al-Hadi, being very young at the time, was smuggled out of Alexandria and taken to the Nizari stronghold of [[Alamut]] Fort in the [[Elburz Mountains]] of northern Iran, south of the [[Caspian Sea]] and under the regency of Dai [[Hasan bin Sabbah]].\n\nThe offshoot of these Muhammad-Shahi Nizari Ismailis recognize the elder son of Shamsu-d-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad, the 28th Qasim-Shahi Imam, named ''Al\u0101'' ad-D\u012bn Mumin Sh\u0101h (the 26th Imam of the Muhammad-Shahi Nizari Ismailis). They recogninze this line of Imams down to the disappearance of the 40th Imam, Amir Muhammad al-Baqir, in 1796. There are followers of this line of Nizari Imams in Syria today, locally called the Jafariyah.\n\n{{See also|List of Ismaili Imams}}\n\n===Origin of the Fidai===\nFollowers of the young Imam Hadi who wished to be fighters were trained as [[Fidai]], whose bravery and self-sacrificing spirituality was due to their belief that the Nizari ''Imam-ul-waqt'' (\"Imam of the time\") had the ''[[N\u016br (Islam)|noor]]'' (light) of God within him. As such it became a religious duty for the Fidai to obey every dictate of their ''Imam-ul-waqt'' and to protect him and their community of believers without compromise even to the extent of dying for their cause.\n\nUnder [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] in Iran, and [[Rashid ad-Din Sinan]] in Syria, the Nizari Fidai targeted the most powerful enemy leaders faced by these new Nizari Ismaili communities in the Elburz Mountains of northern Iran and in the mountains of the [[Levant]]ine coast, the [[Jabal Bahra]], overlooking the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]].\n\nThe Fidai were feared as the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], but did not [[assassinate]] for payment. Although they were trained in the art of [[spying]] and [[combat]], they also practiced Islamic [[mysticism]] at the highest level. This religious ardor turned them into formidable foes, as in the anecdote of [[Count Henry of Champagne]]. Returning from [[Armenia]], Henry spoke with Grand Master [[Rashid ad-Din Sinan]] (known to [[Western world|the West]] as \"The Old Man of the Mountain\") at one of his castles, [[Al-Kahf Castle|al-Kahf]], in Syria. Henry pointed out that since his army was bigger by far than Sinan's, Sinan should pay him an annual tribute.\n\nSinan refused, asserting that his army was far stronger, in spirit and unquestioning obedience if not in numbers. He invited Henry to witness this obedience and sacrificial spirit of his Fidai. Sinan signalled to a Fidai standing on the parapet of a high wall of his castle, to jump. The Fidai called out \"[[Takbir|God is Great]]\" and unhesitatingly took a headlong death dive into the rocks far below.\n\nThe bewildered Henry asked Sinan the cause for the suicidal jump. Sinan pointed once again to the Fidai who had taken the place of the now dead Fidai. Again Sinan gave a signal to the Fidai to jump and the second Fidai also called out \"God is Great\" and jumped to his death. Henry was visibly shaken by the experience of witnessing the two Fidais' total disregard for their own lives. He accepted Sinan's terms of peace on a non-tribute-paying basis. The Nizaris thus averted debilitating wars against them because of their Fidais' feats of self-sacrifice and assassinations of powerful enemy leaders to demonstrate the will and commitment of the community to live free from being a vassal to any Levantine power.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|authorlink1=Bernard Lewis|title=[[The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam]]|date=1967|isbn=9780465004980}}</ref>{{rp|p:25}}\n\nThe Fidai were some of the most feared assassins in the then known world.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:120\u2013158}}<ref name=\"Nowell 1947\">{{cite journal |first=Charles E. |last= Nowell |title= The Old Man of the Mountain |journal=Speculum |volume=22 |issue=4 |year=1947}}</ref> Sinan ordered assassinations against politicians and generals such as the great Kurdish general and founder of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]], [[Saladin]]. A sleeping Saladin had a note from Sinan delivered to him by a Fidai planted in his entourage. The note was pinned to his pillow with a dagger, and it informed Saladin that he had been spared this once and should give up his anti-Nizari militancy. A shaken Saladin quickly made a truce with Sinan.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:144}}\n\nSubsequently, the Fidai aided the Muslim cause against the Christian [[Crusaders]] of the [[Third Crusade]] which included [[Richard the Lion Heart]] of England. Saladin having by now established a friendly relationship with Sinan, the Nizari Fidai themselves joined Saladin's forces to defeat the Crusaders in the last great battle between the two forces. Later on, when \"the Nizaris faced renewed [[Crusades|Frankish]] hostilities, they received timely assistance from the Ayyubids\".<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:146}}\n\nThe Fidais' apparent lack of fear of personal injury or even death could not be understood by the Crusaders, who propagated the black legends of the so-called [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]]. According to Daftary, these were \"fictions ... meant to provide satisfactory explanations for behavior that would otherwise seem strange to the medieval Western mind\".<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:14}} These black legends were then further popularized in the Western world by [[Marco Polo]], the Venetian storyteller who had, in fact, never investigated Sinan, in contradiction to his claim that he had. Polo asserted that Sinan fed [[hashish]] to his drugged followers, the so-called ''Hashishins'' (Assassins), so as to fortify them with the type of courage to commit the assassinations of the most intrepid kind.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:14}}\n\nThis tale of the \"Old Man of the Mountain\" was assembled by Marco Polo and accepted by [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]], a 19th-century [[Austria]]n [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] responsible for much of the spread of this legend. Until the 1930s, Hammer-Purgstall's retelling of Marco Polo's fiction served as the standard description of the Nizari Ismailis across Europe. \"The [[Russia]]n orientalist [[Vladimir Alexeyevich Ivanov]] ... gained access also to Nizari literature preserved in Central Asia, Persia, Afghanistan and elsewhere ... compiled the first detailed catalogue of (Nizari and Fatimid) Ismaili works, citing some 700 separate titles attesting to the hitherto unknown richness and diversity of (Nizari and Fatimid) Ismaili literature and literary traditions\".<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:17}}\n\n===Succession===\n{{Main|Hadith of the pond of Khumm}}\n{{see also|Wikisource:The Last Sermon of Muhammad}}\n\nAs with all [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], the [[Succession to Muhammad|succession of leadership]] following the death of the prophet Muhammed is of major importance to Nizaris. Nizaris believe that at [[Event of Ghadir Khumm|al-Ghadir Khumm]], by God's direct command, Muhammad designated his cousin and son-in-law [[Ali]]\u2014the husband of his daughter [[Fatimah]]\u2014as his successor. As such, Ali became the spiritual successor and the first Imam in the continuing line of hereditary Imams that leads up to the present 49th imam [[Aga Khan IV|Prince Shah Karim Al Hussaini]].\n\nThe Nizari Ismaili tradition is unique in that it is the only tradition that has this continuity of hereditary divine authority vested in the Imamim-Mubeen. In all the Sunni traditions, the Imamim-Mubeen is interpreted as the Quran itself; and in all the Shia traditions, except the Shia Nizari, the Imamim-Mubeen is the last Imam of a dynasty that went into [[occultation (Islam)|occultation]]. However, in Nizari Ismailism, the Imamim-Mubeen is a living human Imam who is never in occultation, who will never ever be absent from this world but will always be perpetually present and physically alive, and who is designated as the inheritor of an Imamate passed down from father to son. This tradition has continued for almost 1400 years.\n\n===Further schisms===\nThe Ismailis and the Twelvers split over the succession to Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]. Ismailis contend that Jafar had designated his son [[Isma'il ibn Jafar]] as his heir and the next Imam in the hereditary line, and thus the Isma'ilis follow the Imamate of Isma'il and his progeny. Although Imam Ismail predeceased his father, Isma'il supposedly had designated his own son Muhammad ibn Ismail as the next hereditary Imam to follow. In opposition to this belief, the Twelvers believe that Imam Ismail's younger brother [[Musa al Kadhim]] was, from the beginning, the rightful successor to Imam Jafar and that Ismail was never a contender.\n\nThe Nizari Ismailis have since split from others, initially from the [[Qarmatians]], [[Druze]], [[Musta'li]] Ismailis, Muhammad Shahi Nizari Ismailis, and [[Satpanth]]is, the last two splitting from the Nizari branch of Ismailism in the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nThe ''Nizari Ismailis'' have always maintained that the [[Imamate|Imamah]] (also known as 'Imamat') can only be inherited from the current Imam to a direct descendant in a father-to-son (or grandson) ''hereditary lineage'' starting with Imam Ali and then to Imam Hussain and so on until their present and living 49th Imam, [[Aga Khan IV|Prince Karim al-Husayni Aga Khan IV]].\n\nThe Nizaris regard Hassan bin (son of) Ali as a Trustee Imam (imam al-mustawda) as opposed to a Hereditary Imam (imam al-mustaqarr). This fact is clearly demonstrated in the recitation of the Nizari Ismailis\u2019 daily prayers three times a day in which although Hassan bin Ali is revered as part of the Prophet's personal family (Ahl al-Bayt), his name is not included in the [[List of Ismaili imams|hereditary lineage]]<ref>Daftary, Farhad (1990).

If Hassan bin Ali's name were to be included as one of the Ismaili Imams in their prayer recitation then the present Imam Prince Karim of the Nizari Ismailis would have to be the 50th Imam and not the 49th Imam - the way he has identified himself and is known to the world.\n\n==Contemporary history==\n{{Main|Aga Khan IV}}\n\nAll Niz\u0101r\u012b Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs now accept Prince Shah Karim Al-Husayni, the [[Aga Khan IV]], as their Im\u0101m-i-Zaman (Imam of the Time). He is referred to in Persian as ''Khudawand'' (Lord of the Time), in Arabic as ''Maulana'' (Master) or ''H\u0101zar Im\u0101m'' (Present Imam). Karim succeeded his grandfather Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah [[Aga Khan III]] as Im\u0101m in 1957, when he was just 20 and still an undergraduate at Harvard University. He was referred to as \"the Imam of the [[Atomic Age]]\". The period following his accession can be characterized as one of rapid political and economic change. Planning of programs and institutions became increasingly difficult due to the rapid changes in the newly emerging post-colonial nations where many of his followers resided. Upon becoming Im\u0101m, Karim's immediate concern was the preparation of his followers, wherever they lived, for the changes that lay ahead. This rapidly evolving situation called for bold initiatives and new programs to reflect developing national aspirations in the newly independent nations.<ref name=Daftary />{{rp|p:206\u2013209}}\n\nIn Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, a major objective of the community's social welfare and economic programs, until the mid-1950s, had been to create a broad base of businessmen, agriculturists, and professionals. The educational facilities of the community tended to emphasize secondary-level education. With the coming of independence, each nation's economic aspirations took on new dimensions, focusing on industrialization and the modernization of agriculture. The community's educational priorities had to be reassessed in the context of new national goals, and new institutions had to be created to respond to the growing complexity of the development process.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1972, under the regime of the then President [[Idi Amin]], Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs and other Asians were expelled from Uganda, despite being citizens of the country and having lived there for generations. The Imam took urgent steps to facilitate the resettlement of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs displaced from Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, and also from Burma. Owing to his personal efforts, most found homes, not only in Asia, but also in Europe and North America. Most of the basic resettlement problems were overcome remarkably rapidly. This was due to the adaptability of the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs themselves\u2014helped in particular by their education\u2014their linguistic abilities, the efforts of the host countries, and the moral and material support from Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b community programs.\n\nIn view of the importance that Isl\u0101m places on maintaining a balance between the spiritual well-being of the individual and the quality of his life, the Im\u0101m's guidance deals with both aspects of the life of his followers. The Aga Khan has encouraged Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b Muslims settled in the industrialized world to contribute towards the progress of communities in the developing world through various development programs. ''[[The Economist]]'' noted that Isma'ili immigrant communities integrated seamlessly as immigrant communities, and did better at attaining graduate and post-graduate degrees, \"far surpassing their native, Hindu, Sikh, fellow Muslims, and Chinese communities\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Economist: Islam, America and Europe |date=June 22, 2006 |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited |location=London, UK}}</ref>\n\n===Silver Jubilee===\nFrom July 1982 to July 1983, to celebrate the present Aga Khan's Silver Jubilee marking the 25th anniversary of his accession to the Imamate, many new social and economic development projects were launched. These ranged from the establishment of the US$450&nbsp;million international [[Aga Khan University]] with its Faculty of Health Sciences and [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi|teaching hospital]] based in Karachi; the expansion of [[Aga Khan Education Services|schools]] for girls and [[Aga Khan Health Services|medical centers]] in the [[Hunza Valley|Hunza region]], one of the remote parts of Northern Pakistan bordering on China and Afghanistan; the establishment of the Aga Khan Rural Support Program in [[Gujarat]], India; and the extension of existing urban hospitals and primary health care centers in [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]]. These initiatives form part of an international network of institutions involved in fields that range from education, health, and rural development, to architecture and the promotion of private sector enterprise and together make up the [[Aga Khan Development Network]].\n\n===Golden Jubilee===\nFrom 2007 to 2008, during the Golden Jubilee marking 50 years of his Imamate, the Aga Khan commissioned a number of projects: renowned [[Pritzker Prize]] winning Japanese architect [[Fumihiko Maki]] was commissioned to design a new kind of community structure, resembling an embassy, in Ottawa, Canada; and the [[Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat]], to be composed of two large interconnected spaces an atrium and a courtyard, opened on 8 December 2008. The atrium is an interior space, to be used all year round. It is protected by a unique glass dome made of multi-faceted, angular planes assembled to create the effect of rock crystal; the Aga Khan asked Maki to consider the qualities of \"rock crystal\", which was valued by the Imams of the Fatimid Empire, in his design. Within the glass dome is an inner layer of woven glass-fibre fabric which will appear to float and hover over the atrium. The delegation building is located on Sussex Drive near the Canadian parliament. Future delegation buildings are planned for other capitals, beginning with Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nIn addition to primary and secondary schools, the Aga Khan academies, were set up to educate future leaders in the developing world. The Aga Khan Museum\u2014which will open in Toronto, Canada\u2014will be the first museum in the West dedicated to Islamic civilization. Due to be completed in 2013, it will be dedicated to the \"acquisition, preservation and display of artefacts \u2013 from various periods and geographies \u2013 relating to the intellectual, cultural, artistic and religious heritage of Islamic communities\". A series of new Isma'ili centres are underway: including in Toronto, Ontario; Houston, Texas; Dushanbe and the Pamir, Tajikistan.\n\n===Diamond Jubilee===\nDuring 2017\u20132018 the Ismaili Muslim community commemorated 60 years since the Aga Khan became the 49th hereditary Imam on 11 July 1957. The Diamond Jubilee was a celebration of the Imam's vision and tireless work, which have steered the Ismaili community through 60 years of changes that posed social, political, and economic challenges.\n\n===Seat of the Ismaili Imamate===\nFollowing a historic agreement with the [[Republic of Portugal]] in 2015, on 11 July 2018, the Aga Khan officially designated the Henrique de Mendon\u00e7a Palace, located on Rua Marqu\u00eas de Fronteira in [[Lisbon]], as the seat of the Ismaili Imamate, the \"[[Divan|Diwan]] of the Ismaili Imamat\".<ref>[https://ismaili.imamat/ Ismaili Imamat]</ref>\n\n==Theology==\n{{Aqidah|Shia}}\n\n===God===\n{{Main|God in Islam}}\n\nNizari Ismaili theology is the pre-eminent negative or [[apophatic theology]] of Islam because it affirms the absolute Oneness of God (''[[tawhid]]'') through negating all names, descriptions, conceptions, and limitations from God. The Ismaili theology of tawhid goes back to the teachings of the early Shi\u2018a Imams, especially Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (d. 661), Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (d. 743), and Imam Ja\u2018far al-Sadiq (d. 765). Additionally, a number of eminent Ismaili Muslim philosophers\u2014Abu Ya\u2018qub al-Sjistani (d. 971), Ja\u2018far ibn Mansur al-Yaman (d. 960), Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani (d. 1021), al-Mu\u2019ayyad al-Din Shirazi (d. 1077), Nasir-i Khusraw (d. 1088), Abd al-Karim al-Shahrastani (d. 1153), Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (d. 1273)\u2014consolidated and refined the Ismaili theology of tawhid using the strongest philosophical arguments of their time. Even in the present age, Imam Shah Karim al-Husayni Aga Khan IV, the present and 49th hereditary Imam of the Shi\u2018a Ismaili Muslims, continues to stress the absolute and utter transcendence of God. At the 1975 All-Ismailia Paris Conference, the Ismaili Imam endorsed and approved the following resolution concerning the contemporary Ismaili position on the concept of God:\n\n<blockquote>The absolute transcendence of God to be emphasized, and the Ismaili belief in God to be expounded in association with the general stress on the transcendence of God in the Qur\u2019an, as exemplified particularly in the Surat al-Ikhlas.<ref>Paris Conference Report, ed. Eqbal Rupani, Paris: 1975, 6</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Ismaili Concept of tawhid can be summarized as follows:<ref>{{cite web |last=Ismaili Gnostic |title=Ismaili Teachings on the Oneness of God (Tawhid): Beyond Personalist Theism and Modern Atheism |url=https://ismailignosis.com/2016/01/22/ismaili-teachings-on-the-oneness-of-god-tawhid-beyond-personalist-theism-and-modern-atheism/ |date=22 January 2016 |website=Ismaili Gnosis |access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n*God is beyond all names and attributes (including every name and attribute mentioned in the Qur\u2019an, such as the Powerful, the Living, the First, the Last, etc.);\n*God is beyond matter, energy, space, time and change;\n*God is beyond all human conceptions of the imagination and intellect;\n*God is beyond both positive and negative qualities\u2014He is not knowing and not not knowing and He is not powerful and not not powerful;\n*God is beyond all philosophical and metaphysical categories\u2014spiritual/material, cause/effect, eternal/temporal, substance/accident, essence/attributes, and existence/essence\u2014God is above existence and non-existence;\n*When God is associated with a name or attribute in scripture, ritual or everyday speech, e.g. \"God is knowing\", the real meaning of this statement is that God is the source and originator of that power or quality, i.e. God is the originator of all knowledge but He Himself is beyond actually possessing knowledge as an attribute;\n*God's Creative Act is called His Word or Command\u2014this Command is a single, eternal, and continuous act which continually gives existence to and sustains all created or conditioned realities in every moment of their existence.\n\nThe full recognition of tawhid, in a mode beyond human rational discourse, is a spiritual and mystical realization in the human soul and intellect called ''ma'rifah''. In the Ismaili ''tariqah'' of Islam, the ma\u2018rifah of the tawhid of God is attained through the Imam of the Time. The perfect soul of the Imam of the Time always experiences the fullness of the ma\u2018rifah of God and his ''murids'' reach that recognition through the recognition (ma\u2018rifah) of the Imam.<ref>Nas\u012br al-Din al-Tusi, tr. S.J. Badakhshani, Contemplation and Action, 44</ref> This is the essential role of the Imam of the time and embodied in the Ismaili Muslim daily prayer called ''[[Dua|du'a']]''. The Imam Sultan Muhammad Shah also alluded to this when he said that the \"real miracle of Hazrat Ali is that he brought people to the Truth\".\n\n===Quran===\n{{Main|Quran|Esoteric interpretation of the Quran}}\n{{See also|Quranic hermeneutics|Exegesis}}\n[[Image:Large Koran.jpg|thumb|upright=1.18|A water colour ink and gold page from a Persian Quran, 14th century]]\n\nNizaris, like all Muslims, consider the [[Quran]], the central [[religious text]] of Islam, to be the word of God.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Qur'an| encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online }}</ref> Nizaris employ ''[[tafsir]]'' (the science of Quranic commentary) for ''[[zahir (Islam)|zahir]]'', or exoteric understanding, and ''[[tawil]]'' (the Quranic poetic metre), for ''[[batin (Islam)|batin]]'', or esoteric understanding.\n\nTawil stems from the Quranic root word \"to return to\" the original meaning of the Quran. While acknowledging the importance of both, the ''zahir'' and the ''batin'' in religion, the ''batin'' informs on how the ''zahir'' is to be practiced. More importantly, the ''batin'' guides the believer on a spiritual journey of discovery of the intangible truth (''[[haqiqa]]'') that engages both the intellect (''[['aql|aql]]'') and the spirit (''[[ruh]]'') with the ultimate destination being that of gnostic enlightenment (''[[marifa]]'' or ''[[Muraqabah#Fana_fillah|fana-fillah]]'').\n\nThe word ''Quran'' means \"recitation\". When Muslims speak of \"the Quran\" in the abstract, they usually mean the scripture as recited rather than the printed work or any translation of it. For the Nizari Ismaili, the ''tafsir'' and ''tawil'' of the Quran are embodied most perfectly in the being of the ''Imam-i-Zaman'' (the Imam of the Time), due to his divinity as \"the Imam from God Himself\" as expressed in the third part of their [[Shahada]].\n\n===Pillars of Islam===\n{{main|Seven pillars of Ismailism}}\n\nIsma'ilism holds that there are [[Seven pillars of Ismailism|seven pillars in Islam]], each of which possesses both an exoteric (\"outer\" or ''zahir'') expression and an esoteric (\"inner\" or ''batin'') one.\n\nThe Foundation:\n\nIsmailis believe in the basic principle of One God, and Prophet Muhammed is the final messenger. However, they believe that Muhammed's progeny are the rightful successors of Islam, hence, they seek guidance from \"the living imam\", who is a living descendant of Muhammed's family. \n\nThe Six Pillars consist of:\n\n# [[Walayah (Ismaili and Druze pillar)|Walayah]] Guardianship ({{lang-ar|\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629}}): cultivating a pure loving, affectionate attachment to, and intimacy with, God\u2014manifested in the Prophets and the Imams by their continually offering loyalty, allegiance, devotion and obedience to God\u2014and to those who manifest divine guardianship\u2014the Prophets and Imams. For the Nizari, God is the true desire of every soul.\n# [[Taharah]] Purity ({{lang-ar|\u0637\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0629}}): physical cleanliness, keeping a hygienic home, and personal presence, but also purity of the heart and the soul.\n# [[Salat]] Prayer ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0629}}): Nizari Isma'ili, as do Imami Shia, practice the Salaah as outlined by the Ja'far\u012b ''[[madhhab]]'', the prayer being performed to mark important festivals. Nizari more generally perform a ritual ''[[Holy Du'a|du'a]]'' three times a day. The Nizari, like the Sufi, practice ''[[dhikr]]''\u2014\"remembrance\" of God, the Prophets, and the Imams\u2014which can take the form of a melodic communal chant or be performed in silence.\n# [[Zakah]] Charity ({{lang-ar|\u0632\u0643\u0627\u0629}}): voluntarily share one's own knowledge or skills, as well as tithing. Nizari are encouraged to actively volunteer in the running of community spaces, and offering their specialized knowledge to the wider community\u2014including legal, medical, or other vocational expertise. Zakah also refers to tithing\u2014Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad was designated to collect ''zak\u0101t'' from believers and it is now the duty of believers to give alms to the Im\u0101m or his representative, to be redistributed to support local and international development.\n# [[Sawm]] Fasting ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u0648\u0645}}): Fasting during the month of [[Ramadan]] and to mark the new moon is believed to be beneficial for those who are overwrought with the base ego\u2014desire, rage, and the self. Isma'ili who are following the ''tariqa'' (path) seek to transcend the base ego so as to attain an inner being that is in harmony. They absorb food as nourishment for a healthy, peaceful, body and mind, as the more important fast is that of mind and heart, where one abstains from unworthy concerns and worldly thoughts, and can be broken by succumbing to the base ego, and its insatiable desires.\n# [[Hajj]] Pilgrimage ({{lang-ar|\u062d\u062c}}): the pilgrimage to Mecca, at least once in an individual's life. For the Nizari, there is also a fuller discovery to be made regarding life. A glimpse (''deedar'') of the Imam's spirit aids them in transforming themselves into spiritual beings they cease to be ordinary people existing within the exoteric reality, but journey to and discover an inner reality of life.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/ismailis.htm | title = Isma'ilism | accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref>\n\n===Rationalism===\n{{main|Imamah (Nizari Ismaili doctrine)}}\n\nVarious rival approaches to the challenge that Greek rationalism posed to Quranic revelation permeated early Islamic society. The [[Ash'ari|Ash\u02bfaris]] considered ''[[Kalam]]'' (reason) as contradictory to Islam, and ''[[Islamic philosophy|falsafa]]'' (philosophy) as antagonistic to faith, which asserts the absolute supremacy of revelation, and the abandonment of reason in the spiritual and secular space (which are interconnected within orthodox Islam). The [[Mu'tazili]]s took a less absolutist approach, allowing for a limited role of reason (Kalam). [[Isma'ili]]s adopted an altogether more philosophical approach, in which only through reasoned discourse could one attain understanding of revelation, social structure, and individualism, as well as the functioning of the natural world. For this reason [[Isma'ili]]s produced a relatively scant collection of theological discourse in comparison to other Shia, and the Sunni. Yet they had a leading place in the development of philosophical discourse within the Islamic world.\n\nWhile Nizaris subscribe to the [[Imamate in Nizari doctrine|Imami jurisprudence]], they also follow in part the ''[[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'f\u0101riyya]]'' ''Madhhab'' (school of Jurisprudence), which is believed by Shias to have been founded by Imam [[Jafar Sadiq|Ja'far as-Sadiq]]. Nizaris adhere to supremacy of ''Kalam'' in the interpretation of scripture, and in the temporal relativism of understanding, as opposed to ''[[fiqh]]'' (traditional [[nomianism|legalism]]), which adheres to an [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]] approach to [[revelation]].\n\nFor Nizaris, there exists a dialectic between revelation and human reasoning, based on a synergy of Islamic scripture and classical Greek philosophy, in particular [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] reasoning and [[Platonism|Platonic]] metaphysics. It seeks to extend an understanding of religion and revelation to identify the outwardly apparent (''zahir''), and also to penetrate to the roots, to retrieve and disclose that which is the inner underlying (''[[Batin (Islam)|batin]]''). This process of discovery engages both the intellect (''[['aql]]'') and the spirit (''[[ruh]]''), generating an integral synergy to illuminate and disclose truths (''[[Haqiqa|haqi'qat]]'') culminating in ''[[gnosis]]'' (''[[marifa|ma'rifat]]'').\n\n==Community==\n\n===World Constitution===\n{{Main|Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b Constitution}}\n\nThe present Aga Khan continued the practice of his predecessor and gave constitutions to Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b communities in the US, Canada, several European countries, the Persian Gulf, Syria, and Iran, following a process of consultation within each constituency. In 1986, he promulgated a World Constitution that, for the first time, brought the social governance of the worldwide Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b community into a single structure with built-in flexibility to account for diverse circumstances of different regions. Served by volunteers appointed by and accountable to the Imam, the Constitution functions to enable individual creativity in an ethos of group responsibility to promote the common well-being.\n\nLike its predecessors, the present constitution is founded on adherence to the basic principles of Islam, belief in one God and Muhammad as the seal of the prophets, and on each Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b's spiritual allegiance to the Im\u0101m of the Time, which is separate from the secular allegiance that all Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs owe as citizens to their national entities. The present Imam and his predecessor emphasized every Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b's allegiance to his or her country as a fundamental obligation. These obligations are discharged not by passive affirmation but through responsible engagement and active commitment to uphold national integrity and contribute to peaceful development.\n\n===Places of Worship===\n{{Main|Jama'at Khana}}\n\n[[Jama'at Khana]] ({{lang-fa|\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u062a\u200c\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647}}, from the Arabic ''Jamaat'' (congregation) and the Persian ''Khaneh'' (house)) are Isma'ili houses of prayer, study, and community. They usually contain separate spaces for prayer and a social hall for community gatherings.\nThere are no principle architectural guidelines for Jama'at Khana, although inspiration is drawn from Islamic architecture and local architectural traditions to seamlessly and discreetly blend them with the local architectural environment, informed by a minimalist design aesthetic.\n\nLarger Jama'at Khana are referred to as ''Darkhanas'', or \"Isma'ili Centers\" in the West, and have been referred to as \"Isma'ili Cathedrals\" by observers. While containing prayer and social infrastructure albeit on a larger scale, they may also contain auditoriums and lecture spaces, libraries, offices, and council chambers, as they act as the regional or national governing centers for community administration.\n\nJama'at Khana, particularly the larger centers, offer their spaces to the community at large, and arrange guided tours. However, during the obligatory prayer (''[[Holy Du'a]]'') only Isma'ili are allowed to enter the prayer hall (''[[masjid]]'').\n\nFrom the ''Encyclopaedia of Ismailism'' by Mumtaz Ali Tajddin:\n\n<blockquote>In the Ismaili tariqah, the guardian of each Jamatkhana is called [[mukhi]] (in the South-Asian tradition) or Sheikh (in the Arab tradition) there are also other names that are applied based on the cultural context of the Jamat, mukhi is a word derived from mukhiya means foremost. Since the Imam physically is not present all the times in the Jamatkhana, the Mukhi acts [as the] tangible symbol of the Imam's authority. In the big jamat, the Mukhi was assisted by a caretaker called tha'nak. Later, the office of kamadia (from kamdar [meaning] accountant) was created. The Mukhi and Kamadia are the traditional titles going back to the pre-Aga Khan period when they enjoyed considerable local power. Their responsibilities include officiating over the daily rituals in the Jamatkhana, but they are primarily lay officials. Since the wholesale reorganizations undertaken by the Imams, the local committees are now tied into an elaborately hierarchical administrative structure of boards and councils.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Symbols===\n[[File:Ismaili colors.svg|thumb|The [[Nizari Ismaili|Niz\u0101r\u012b Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b]] flag known as \"My Flag\"]]\n\nThe Fatimids adopted Green (''akhdar'') as the colour of their standard, which symbolized their allegiance to Ali, who, in order to thwart an assassination attempt on Muhammad, once wrapped himself in a green coverlet to appear to be Muhammad. When [[Hassan I Sabbah]] captured Alamut, it is said he hoisted the green standard over the fortress, it was later reported that Hassan I Sabbah prophesied that when the Hidden Imam made himself known he would hoist a red flag, which Hasan II did during his appearance. Following the destruction of Alamut, Isma'ili hoisted both green and red flags above the tombs of their Imams. Green and Red were combined in the 19th century Isma'ili flag known as \"My Flag\".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe Fatimids also used a white standard with gold inlays, and the Caliph Imams often wore white with gold, as Isma'ili Imams do today. Isma'ili use a gold crest on white standard to symbolize the authority of Imamate, and often wear white in the presence of their Imam.\n\nThe [[heptagram]], a seven pointed star, is often used by Isma'ilis as a symbol.\n\n==Practices==\n\n===Marriage===\nMarriage (''{{'}}ur'', \u0639\u0631\u0633) is a legal wedding contract (''[[Nikah]]'',  \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0643\u0627\u062d) between a consenting adult man and a woman, and it is not considered a sacrament in Islam as it is in Christianity and other religions. As a contract, it allows both parties to add certain conditions. Nizari ideals of marriage envision a long-term union.\n\nSince marriage is not considered a sacrament, Nizari Isma'ili consider secular court marriages in the West as valid legal contracts. However many Isma'ili couples opt to have both a court marriage to secure legal recognition as well as a ''Nikah'' ceremony performed at a Jama'at Khana.\n\nUnlike many other groups, inter-faith marriages are recognized by the community. In addition to the other Abrahamic faiths, the prevalence of Nizari Ismailis of South Asian descent has resulted in growing numbers married to those of [[Dharmic faiths]], such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]], as well as other Indian religions, such as [[Sikhism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]. The [[Aga Khan IV]] has said that he has no objection to increasingly-common mixed marriages, and has met non-Ismaili spouses and children during his various ''[[deedars]]'' throughout the world. In fact, many members of his family, including his daughter [[Princess Zahra Aga Khan]], have married non-Ismailis in inter-faith ceremonies. [[Islam and children#Marriage|Child marriages]] are strictly prohibited. The Aga Khan IV also condemned [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]], except in certain circumstances.<ref>{{cite book|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|title=Historical Dictionary of the Ismailis|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|pages=113-114}}</ref>\n\n===Offerings===\n{{Main|N\u0101ndi}}\n\n''[[N\u0101ndi]]'' is a ceremony in which food is symbolically offered to the [[Imamah (Shi'a Ismaili doctrine)|Im\u0101m-e Zam\u0101n]], and is subsequently auctioned to the congregation. Money obtained is forwarded to the Imam by officials. The ceremony is conducted by volunteers from the community. The food is prepared at home and is brought to the Jama'at Khana; the [[Mukhi]] (congregation head) blesses the food offering, known as ''Mehm\u0101ni'', at the end of prayers, informing the congregation that it has been offered to the Imam and the benefits of it are for the whole Jamat. If no physical food offering has been brought to the Jama'at Khana, then a symbolic plate called the \"Mehm\u0101ni plate\", which serves as a substitute, can be touched during the ''[[Du'a Karavi]]'' ceremony.\n\nThe origins of ''N\u0101ndi'' are said to be in the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s time when a similar practice occurred.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Calendar===\nNizari use an arithmetically based lunar calendar to calculate the year, unlike most Muslim communities, which rely on visual sightings. The Isma'ili calendar was developed in the Middle Ages during the Faitmid Caliphate of Imam Al-Hakim.\n\nA lunar year contains about 354 11/30 days, Nizari Isma'ili employ a cycle of 11 leap years (''kasibah'') with 355 days in a 30-year cycle. The odd-numbered months contain 30 days and the even numbered months 29 days; the 12th and final month in a leap year contains 30 days.\n\nNizari use 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26, 29, respectively, in their calculations.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Aga Khan Development Network==\nThe Aga Khan Development Network<ref>[http://www.akdn.org Aga Khan Development Network]</ref> (AKDN) was set up by the Imamate and the Ismaili community as a group of private, non-denominational development agencies that seek to empower communities and individuals, regardless of ethnicity or religious affiliation, and seek to improve living conditions and opportunities within the developing world.

The asclepeion at [[Epidauros|Epidaurus]] is both extensive and well preserved. There is also an asclepeion located on the south slopes of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] which dates to around 420 BC.\n\nLocated on the [[Argolid Peninsula|Argolid plain]] of the east Peloponnese in Greece, Epidaurus was the main asclepeion. The healing temple was named after Asclepius, the son of Apollo.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Epidaurus|url = http://www.ancient.eu/epidaurus|website = Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate = 2015-10-26| via= ancient.eu}}</ref> At the Epidaurus, there were various people such as physicians and priests who would assist those who sought a session of healing from these professionals. Patients would come pay homage to the gods by making pilgrimages to the site, performing a prayer or a sacrifice, giving monetary gifts or even sleep at the temple. The Epidaurus also served as a sanctuary for those who were extremely ill. It was eventually expanded to a one hundred eighty-room institution to house the dying and women in labour during the Roman Empire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Procedures Performed at Asclepeions ==\n[[File:Patients sleeping in the temple of Aesculapius at Epidaurus.

By attending to these things, the patient's innate healing mechanisms were activated, which promoted recovery.<ref name=\"Twofiftynine\" />\n\nThere were two steps in order for a patient to be considered to be treated in the asclepeion. The first of which is the [[Catharsis|Katharsis]] or purification stage. This is when a patient undergoes a series of baths and other methods of purging, such as a clean diet over a series of several days or purging their emotions through art. The patient would then make an offering such as money or a prayer to the temple, therefore to Asclepius. The priest of the temple then gives the patient a prayer in which it would ease the patient's mind and create a more positive outlook for them.\n\nAfterwards, comes [[Incubation (ritual)|incubation]] or dream therapy. Patients would sleep in the \u201cAbaton\u201d or \u201cEnkoimeterion,\u201d which was a dormitory located in the asclepeion. Here, they would be lulled into a hypnotic state, likely induced by hallucinogens, and begin their dream journey.<ref name=\"Twofiftynine\" /> As they slept, they were visited by Asclepius or his daughters Hygeia and Panacea. These dream visitations were prognostic in nature, revealing the projected course of the disease and ultimate patient outcomes. During this time, patients would also discover what it was they needed to do once they woke in order to treat their disease. Upon awakening, the patient would recount their dream to a temple priest, who would then prescribe a treatment based on their interpretation. Other dreams were less direct, and more symbolic. The physician - priests at the Asclepions were also master dream interpreters who would divine the treatment to be followed from the patient's account of the dream. The god Asclepius had certain totem animals in whose guise he liked to visit the supplicants as they slept. These were the dog, the rooster, and of course, the snake.<ref name=\"greekmedicine.net\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ancient Greek medicine]]\n*[[Pool of Bethesda]]\n*[[Temple of Eshmun]]\n*[[Tiber Island]], a seat of the ancient temple of Asclepius and later a hospital\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Temples of Asclepius}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721075458/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/eh151.jsp?obj_id=2395 Ministry of Culture/ Asclepeion of Epidaurus]\n*[http://pautaliya-asklepion.free.bg/ Asclepeion of Pautaliya]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081230101059/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh352.jsp?obj_id=2611 Ministry of Culture/ Asclepion of Trikala]\n*[http://users.otenet.gr/~altagr/english/main.htm Presentation of Tholos] - The Asclepieion at Epidaurus (click \"Presentation\")\n* http://www.greekmedicine.net/mythology/asclepius.html\n* https://www.ancient.eu/Asclepius/\n\n[[Category:Greek temples]]\n[[Category:Temples of Asclepius| ]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek medicine]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|ancient healing temples|the municipality of Argolis|Asklipieio|other buildings and structures related to Asclepius|Temple of Asclepius (disambiguation){{!}}Temple of Asclepius}}\n\n[[File:Kos Asklepeion.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tourists enjoying the panoramic view of the city from the ''Askleipion'' on [[Kos]]]]\n'''Asclepeions''' ({{lang-grc|\u1f08\u03c3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd}} ''Asklepieion''; \u1f08\u03c3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd in [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]]; [[Latin]] ''aesculap\u012bum'') were '''healing temples''' located in [[ancient Greece]] (and in the wider [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world), dedicated to Asclepius, the first doctor-demigod in Greek mythology.<ref name=\"Kanellou\">{{cite journal |last1=Kanellou |first1=V |title=Ancient Greek medicine as the foundation of contemporary medicine |journal=Techniques in Coloproctology |date=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=3\u20134}}</ref> Asclepius was said to have been such a skilled doctor that he could even raise people from the dead.

Under Apollo's mentorship, Chiron grew in his craft so much so that Apollo himself entrusted Chiron to train his son, Asclepius.<ref name=\"Kanellou\" /> Through his studies, Asclepius became so deft at medicine, especially the art of surgery, that he was able to return the living from the dead. His abilities quickly drew attention and jealousy from the other gods. As one story goes, Asclepius was killed by Zeus at the request of Hades, the god of the underworld, who feared Asclepius was stealing souls away from him.<ref name=\"Kanellou\" /> Before his death, however, Asclepius had several children, including: [[Machaon (physician)|Machaon]], [[Podalirius]], [[Hygeia]], and [[Panacea]], who themselves were regarded as highly effective healers.<ref name=\"Kanellou\" />\n\nStarting around 350 BC, the cult of [[Asclepius]] became increasingly popular. He was admired for serving people despite their class and social status, which was not a common practice by [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]].<ref name=\"Morris\">{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=D.B. |title=Un-forgetting Asclepius: An Erotics of Illness |journal=New Literary History |date=2007 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=419\u2013441|doi=10.1353/nlh.2007.0036 }}</ref> Doctors claiming to be the direct descendants of Asclepius referred to themselves as \u201cAsclepiads.\u201d<ref name=\"Kanellou\" /> Asclepius is further survived in modern times with the symbol of [[Rod of Asclepius|a snake wrapped around a staff]], which is seen throughout all medical infrastructures as well as the [[American Medical Association]] in modern times, is reminiscent of the staff that Asclepius carried.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Greek Medicine - Asclepius |url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_asclepius.html|website = nlm.nih.gov| publisher= US National Library of Medicine| accessdate = 2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\n== Asclepeion Temples ==\n\nOver 300 asclepieia have been discovered throughout ancient Greece.

Ancient mythographers generally regarded Trikka as the place of Asclepius' birth, but to date archaeological excavations have yet to uncover his sanctuary there.<ref>Edelstein, E. J. and L. L.

The asclepeion at [[Epidauros|Epidaurus]] is both extensive and well preserved. There is also an asclepeion located on the south slopes of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] which dates to around 420 BC.\n\nLocated on the [[Argolid Peninsula|Argolid plain]] of the east Peloponnese in Greece, Epidaurus was the main asclepeion. The healing temple was named after Asclepius, the son of Apollo.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Epidaurus|url = http://www.ancient.eu/epidaurus|website = Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate = 2015-10-26| via= ancient.eu}}</ref> At the Epidaurus, there were various people such as physicians and priests who would assist those who sought a session of healing from these professionals. Patients would come pay homage to the gods by making pilgrimages to the site, performing a prayer or a sacrifice, giving monetary gifts or even sleep at the temple. The Epidaurus also served as a sanctuary for those who were extremely ill. It was eventually expanded to a one hundred eighty-room institution to house the dying and women in labour during the Roman Empire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Procedures Performed at Asclepeions ==\n[[File:Patients sleeping in the temple of Aesculapius at Epidaurus. Wellcome V0018154.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Patients sleeping in the temple of Aesculapius at Epidaurus. Wellcome V0018154]]\n\nSignature to asclepian medicine was its holistic approach to patient care.<ref name=\"nutton\" /> It emphasized therapy through the natural environment, hence the carefully chosen locations, as well as care for the patient's psychological and emotional states. By attending to these things, the patient's innate healing mechanisms were activated, which promoted recovery.<ref name=\"Twofiftynine\" />\n\nThere were two steps in order for a patient to be considered to be treated in the asclepeion. The first of which is the [[Catharsis|Katharsis]] or purification stage. This is when a patient undergoes a series of baths and other methods of purging, such as a clean diet over a series of several days or purging their emotions through art. The patient would then make an offering such as money or a prayer to the temple, therefore to Asclepius. The priest of the temple then gives the patient a prayer in which it would ease the patient's mind and create a more positive outlook for them.\n\nAfterwards, comes [[Incubation (ritual)|incubation]] or dream therapy. Patients would sleep in the \u201cAbaton\u201d or \u201cEnkoimeterion,\u201d which was a dormitory located in the asclepeion. Here, they would be lulled into a hypnotic state, likely induced by hallucinogens, and begin their dream journey.<ref name=\"Twofiftynine\" /> As they slept, they were visited by Asclepius or his daughters Hygeia and Panacea. These dream visitations were prognostic in nature, revealing the projected course of the disease and ultimate patient outcomes. During this time, patients would also discover what it was they needed to do once they woke in order to treat their disease. Upon awakening, the patient would recount their dream to a temple priest, who would then prescribe a treatment based on their interpretation. Other dreams were less direct, and more symbolic. The physician - priests at the Asclepions were also master dream interpreters who would divine the treatment to be followed from the patient's account of the dream. The god Asclepius had certain totem animals in whose guise he liked to visit the supplicants as they slept. These were the dog, the rooster, and of course, the snake.<ref name=\"greekmedicine.net\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ancient Greek medicine]]\n*[[Pool of Bethesda]]\n*[[Temple of Eshmun]]\n*[[Tiber Island]], a seat of the ancient temple of Asclepius and later a hospital\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Temples of Asclepius}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721075458/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/eh151.jsp?obj_id=2395 Ministry of Culture/ Asclepeion of Epidaurus]\n*[http://pautaliya-asklepion.free.bg/ Asclepeion of Pautaliya]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081230101059/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh352.jsp?obj_id=2611 Ministry of Culture/ Asclepion of Trikala]\n*[http://users.otenet.gr/~altagr/english/main.htm Presentation of Tholos] - The Asclepieion at Epidaurus (click \"Presentation\")\n* http://www.greekmedicine.net/mythology/asclepius.html\n* https://www.ancient.eu/Asclepius/\n\n[[Category:Greek temples]]\n[[Category:Temples of Asclepius| ]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek medicine]]\n", "name_user": "2800:370:c1:9770:907e:24f8:80d0:9ad1", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepeion"}

Strangely, it was some time before he actually appeared on a show with the X-Men.\n\n===''Spider-Man'' (1967 TV series)===\nIn the 1967 ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, Spider-Man battled a scientist named Dr. Matto Magneto wielding a magnetic gun in \"The Revenge of Dr. Magneto\". The character was (very) loosely based on the Magneto character from the comics, and more closely resembled [[Albert Einstein]] instead of Erik Magnus Lehnsherr. This character is also not a mutant nor had any super powers. His name is pronounced \"Mag-''netto''\" instead of \"Mag-neet-o\" because he is German.\n\n===''Fantastic Four'' (1978 TV series)===\nIn the 1978 [[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|''Fantastic Four'']] animated series, Magneto (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) briefly took control of the team in \"The Menace Of Magneto\". Here, he is not depicted as a mutant. Instead he is simply an extremely powerful supervillain with typical aspirations such as robbing a bank. Instead of flying, he moves around in a bizarre, car-like device which he moves using his magnetic powers. He was defeated when [[Reed Richards]] tricked him with a wooden gun.\n\n===1980s===\n\n====''Spider-Man'' (1981 TV series)====\nThe solo [[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|''Spider-Man'']] animated series from 1981 featured Magneto in the episode \"When Magneto Speaks... People Listen\". In this version he used the alias Mr. M, took over and hid several of the world's communication satellites and demanded $100&nbsp;million in gold to return power to the world. He was defeated by Spider Man who was able to turn his magnet power back at him using a microwave relay but Magneto managed to escape.\n\n====''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends''====\nMagneto returned in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', attempting to free his fellow mutants from prison in \"The Prison Plot\". He was voiced by [[Michael Rye]]. The character also made a cameo appearance in flashback in \"A Firestar Is Born\", as [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] recounts her past to the X-Men. In spite of his Spider-Man television appearances, he has appeared in only two issues of a Spider-Man title.\n\n====''Pryde of the X-Men''====\nMagneto was the main villain in the animated X-Men pilot ''[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men]]'' - his first actual animated appearance battling the X-Men. He was voiced by [[Earl Boen]].\n\n===''X-Men'' (TV series)===\n[[Image:Magneto 1992.png|thumb|right|Magneto's 1st appearance in the show to an incarcerated Beast in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men animated series]]''.]]\nMagneto's voice was provided by [[David Hemblen]] in the series ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'', where he played a prominent role. Curiously, though he began on the show as a villain, his character spent more time as an ally to the X-Men, fighting alongside them against common enemies such as the Sentinels and Mr. Sinister as opposed to the cold-hearted villain he was previously portrayed as in earlier shows like ''Pryde of the X-Men''.\n\nIn the series, he briefly appears in the first episode \"Night of the Sentinels: Part I\" on a television screen Jubilee accidentally turns on with her powers but Magneto makes his true first appearance in the third episode \"[[Enter Magneto]]\", where he attempts to incite a war between humans and mutants by attacking a military base and launching its nuclear armaments, though they are prevented from reaching their targets by the X-Men. It is revealed that his real name is Magnus, and he is an old friend of Xavier's. However, a violent encounter with an army convinces Magnus that humans and mutants can't coexist, and the two parted ways.\n\nHe reappears in the next episode \"[[Deadly Reunions]]\", when he attacks a chemical plant in an effort to draw Xavier out to face him. After defeating Cyclops, Rogue and Storm, Xavier meets his challenge and they do battle. Though Magneto gains the upper hand, Xavier tortures him with repressed memories of his childhood during [[The Holocaust]], causing Magneto to flee in agony. In the first-season finale, he kidnaps Senator Kelly in order to once again attempt to begin a war, but is thwarted by a group of Sentinels. After Mastermold and the other Sentinels rebel against their creators and become a threat to the entire world, Magneto allies himself with the X-Men and they successfully eliminate the Sentinels, during which he saves Xavier's life.\n\nHe appears in nearly every episode in the second season, in which he and Professor Xavier have been depowered and travel throughout the Savage Land. At the end of that season, all of the X-Men save them from Mr. Sinister, and they regain their powers.\n\nIn season four, he creates Asteroid M as a safe haven for mutants who feel persecuted on Earth. Though his intentions are noble, a betrayal by his closest servant [[Fabian Cortez]] puts into motion a series of events after which he realizes that the world will never again trust him as the leader of the Asteroid, and he allows the base to be destroyed. In the fourth-season finale, Magneto teams up with Apocalypse, believing that the immortal will use his powers to resurrect his wife. When he discovers that Apocalypse plans to destroy all reality, Magneto helps the X-Men to defeat him.\n\nDisheartened by the loss of his sanctuary, he does not care about even the impending assimilation of mankind by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], until he receives news from the Beast, Forge, Mr. Sinister and Amelia Voght that his son, Quicksilver, has been kidnapped by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] in the second part of the two-part fifth-season premiere. He teams up with them to defeat the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] and save everyone they had captured or assimilated.\n\nHis final appearance is in the last episode of the series  \"Graduation Day\", he has gathered up an entire army of rebellious mutants, and is poised to conquer the world, but receives news from Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Grey that Professor Xavier is dying. Relenting, Magneto uses his power in conjunction with Xavier's in order to contact Lilandra Neramani, who takes Xavier to her planet where there is a suggestion that he may be cured. He is last seen along with the X-Men standing outside the mansion as Professor X departs.\n\nAs with many television shows, ''X-Men: The Animated Series'' has suffered from continuity errors. For one, in the episode where Magneto makes his initial appearance, aptly titled \"Enter Magneto\", the X-Men do not know him, as he is an old acquaintance of Xavier's. However, as the series progresses Magneto is shown fighting [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] during a flashback in \"Cold Comfort\". It may be possible that only Iceman knows him since he was not present in \"Enter Magneto\" and was the only one fighting Magneto in the flashback.\n\n===2000s===\n\n====''X-Men: Evolution''====\nMagneto's voice was provided by [[Christopher Judge]] in the animated television series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''.\n\nDuring the show's first season he is a shadowy, mysterious manipulator where the X-Men, except for Professor Xavier, do not know of his existence, until the first X-Man, Wolverine, figures it out, although Magneto becomes a more direct threat from the first-season finale. In the first season he uses his agent [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] to assemble [[Brotherhood of Mutants|a team of mutants]], and even recruits his own son Quicksilver to spy on them. In the first-season finale, he pits the Brotherhood against the X-Men and brings the winners to [[Asteroid M]] in an attempt to convince them to join his cause and to use a genetic enhancer to fully develop their powers as he had. His decision to leave Mystique behind leads her to betray him (although flashbacks indicate that they have been at odds since Magneto separated Mystique from her newborn son [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]), and their vendetta lasts throughout the second season.\n\nIn the second season, Magneto personally recruits a new team, the Acolytes, de-ages himself using the same technology that created [[Captain America]] as his genetic enhancements are no longer working, and finally reveals the existence of mutants to the public after the X-Men and Brotherhood fight off a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] which was meant to destroy every mutant known. In this time his daughter [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] is introduced, who hates Magneto for abandoning her as a child and leaving her in a mental asylum (when asked about what specific event led to Magneto institutionalizing Wanda, ''X-Men: Evolution'''s head writer Greg Johnson stated that \"There was no specific event. It was just years of him trying to handle a hostile, out of control child whose powers were promising to be very destructive if he didn't get her put away.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://x-men.toonzone.net/qagreg2.php |title=Beyond Evolution: X-Men Evolution |publisher=X-men.toonzone.net |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>). She hunts him down relentlessly until he uses the mutant [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] to change her memories, painting him in a new light.\n\nIn the third and fourth seasons of the show, Magneto dedicates himself to preventing the awakening of the mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], although all his attempts fail and upon Apocalypse's awakening he is transformed into one of his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]] after he is thought to have been killed by Apocalypse. He is freed of this enslavement in the finale episode \"Ascension: Part Two\", and is last seen being helped by his two children. In the final moments of the episode, Charles Xavier reveals that he witnessed the future in the mind of Apocalypse, and among the visions he saw was Magneto becoming an ally of the X-Men and training the New Mutants, like he did in the comics.\n\nIn this series, Magneto uses a device aboard [[Asteroid M]] to advance his evolution, and propelling his abilities to further heights. Evidently, this advancement pushes him onto another plateau of existing as a mutant. A claim that he references when he goes to fight Apocalypse, declaring that it is a battle between \"higher evolutionaries.\" This is enforced by Caliban's claim that Magneto is too far advanced for him to locate, but that any other mutant was still within his capabilities.\n\n====''Wolverine and the X-Men''====\nMagneto appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' voiced by [[Tom Kane]] in a rendition of [[Ian McKellen]]'s portrayal of Magneto in the X-Men films. He is shown to rule the island of Genosha, where it appears most mutants are moving to, in light of recent anti-mutant feelings. Despite the government's treatment of mutants, they seem content to allow Magneto to promote Genosha in the United States with assorted poster and commercials. It is later revealed that Magneto found Professor X unconscious on Genosha after the destruction of the X-Mansion and took to caring for him. When the X-Men arrive to \"rescue him\" Magneto turns over his care to them, stating that they are his family. When Nightcrawler arrived in Genosha, he had his daughter Scarlet Witch give him a tour. During that time, he sends Mystique to the X-Mansion to \"check up\" on Professor X. Magneto, Scarlet Witch, and the Acolytes attacked Nightcrawler when he discovered Magneto's underground cells. When Nightcrawler did a lot of teleporting to warn the X-Men, Magneto had Mystique intercept him while he prepared a special cell for Nightcrawler. Magneto gave Quicksilver and his Brotherhood of Mutants a mission. During the transmission, Quicksilver tells his father that if they pull this off, he'd better receive a warm welcome back to Genosha. In \"Battle Lines\", Magneto had a talk with Senator Kelly about holding back the powerful mutants from being sent to Genosha. He later has his Acolytes raid the MRD prisons to free the mutants. In \"Hunting Grounds\", he finds out that Scarlet Witch and Nightcrawler had been abducted by Mojo. After the rescue, Scarlet Witch persuades Magneto to let Wolverine and Nightcrawler go. In \"Backlash\", Quicksilver was not pleased with Magneto when he cuts Quicksilver's Brotherhood of Mutants loose. After a chat with Quicksilver, he has Scarlet Witch notify the MRD of the Brotherhood's hideout. In \"Aces and Eights\", Senator Kelly sends Gambit to steal Magneto's helmet. When Gambit gets away without the helmet and Magneto learns of this, he was about to pummel Senator Kelly until intervention by the X-Men prevented this, showing Magneto and Kelly the true horror of the future their actions are creating.\n\nWhile Kelly listens to reason and agrees to stop the Sentinel program, Magneto refuses to give up on his ambitions. In the three-part episode \"Foresight\", Magneto sends Mystique to pose as Senator Kelly to unleash the Sentinels on Genosha, making it appear as though Kelly started the attack. When the Sentinels attack Genosha, Magneto initially does nothing, claiming that the weak must be sacrificed so the strong can rally together. He then uses his powers to reprogram them to attack humans. He was knocked off his Sentinel by the Phoenix Force yet was rescued by Quicksilver who takes him back to Genosha. After the Phoenix Force was stopped, Scarlet Witch and Polaris had Blink teleport Magneto and Quicksilver away from Genosha. Finally seeing the corrupt and misguided nature of her father, Scarlet Witch takes control of Genosha with the islanders' full support. Though Scarlet Witch tells Quicksilver that he is always welcome in Genosha, she also states that Genosha is no longer Magneto's country; therefore banishing her own father.\n\n====''The Super Hero Squad Show''====\nMagneto appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0905/12/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Tuesday, May 12, 2009 |publisher=Comicscontinuum.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> Besides being depicted as an ally of [[Doctor Doom]], this version is shown trying to train his children Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to follow his legacy. In \"Hexed, Vexed, and Perplexed\", he arrived in Super Hero City with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in a plot to steal the Infinity Fractals from the Vault for Doctor Doom. He ends up fighting Captain America, Hawkeye, and the Super Hero Squad. When [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] makes an attack on Magneto, Quicksilver uses his super speed to deflect the attack back at Falcon. Magneto sends his children to infiltrate the Helicarrier to steal the security codes in order to infiltrate the Vault. When the Super Hero Squad attacks, Magneto grabs an Infinity Fractal which gives him the ability to control matter which he uses to stop Falcon in mid-air. Scarlet Witch objects to Magneto hurting him more. Magneto releases them from his control only to take Falcon and Redwing captive as Quicksilver grabs the Infinity Fractals. Magneto then traps the Super Hero Squad in metal. Quicksilver discovers that Magneto had stolen the Infinity Fractals all along. Doctor Doom later attacks Magneto blaming him for stealing the Infinity Fractals until Falcon makes off with them. Doctor Doom holds Magneto responsible for his children helping Falcon and knocks him out. In \"Lo, How the Mighty Hath Abdicated!\", Magneto and Quicksilver attack the Helicarrier thinking that Scarlet Witch was kidnapped and brainwashed by the Super Hero Squad. Their fight ends up crashing the Helicarrier into Asgard. When Odin is freed from Enchantress' love lutefisk, he convinces Magneto to let Scarlet Witch stay with the Super Hero Squad. When Scarlet Witch states that she will come to Magneto when he needs her, Magneto states that if they meet as hero and villain, it will be different. Due to his transportation being wrecked, Magneto and Quicksilver ask the Super Hero Squad for a ride back to Super Hero City. A vastly older version appears in the alternate universe episode \"Days, Nights, and Weekends of Futures Past\", where he helps Falcon, HERBIE, and Reptil (known as \"The Man\") reform Scarlet Witch. Here, he is seen using a [[Walker (mobility)|zimmer frame]], complete with a bicycle horn, but later uses a scooter composed of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] pieces.\n\n===2010s===\n\n====''Marvel Anime''====\nMagneto was referenced in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''. In \"Conflict,\" Cyclops mentions that Magneto is in a special plastic cell when discussing on how a metal bridge was twisted in a different direction. In a post-credits scene to \"Destiny,\" it is revealed that Magneto's plastic prison has been destroyed and he has escaped.\n\n====''Iron Man: Armored Adventures''====\nMagneto appears in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode \"The X-Factor\" voiced by [[Ron Halder]], also in a rendition of McKellen from the films. His alias includes Magnus, Max Eisenhart and Erik Lensherr and it is mentioned he was a victim of the [[Weapon X]] program (like the Ultimate version), and is considered to be as dangerous as [[Doctor Doom]], as revealed when Pepper looks up his [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] profile. Iron Man encounters Magneto in a parking lot having bounded anti-mutant activist [[Simon Trask]] with a metal pipe and ends up attacked by Magneto with the battle ending with Iron Man dropped into the trash cans. He was targeting Annie Clairmont (who was an alias for [[Jean Grey]]) and ends up catching up to her when she was at a diner with Tony Stark, [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], and [[Pepper Potts]]. Tony Stark becomes Iron Man while Magneto pursues Annie, Pepper, and James. When Iron Man arrives, Magneto uses his magnetic abilities on Iron Man and tries to constrict him. Annie tries to use her telekinesis to help Ironman but Magneto sends the metal objects  back at them. As Iron Man shuts down, Magneto uses his magnetic abilities to make off with Annie. At Magneto's hideaway, Magneto shows Annie the footage of Senator Robert Kelly's campaign against mutants and recaps his history of being experimented upon. When Annie tries to make mental contact with Iron Man, Magneto reveals to Annie that he had his hideout lined with the same mental-deflecting metal used for his helmet. Magneto plans to have Annie help him wage war against the humans one way or the other. When Iron Man and War Machine find Magneto's hideout, they get a mental message from Annie telling him where Magneto is. Using a special armor, Iron Man fights Magneto with War Machine's help. Both Iron Man and War Machine had a hard time fighting Magneto and his magnetic powers. Using his special force field, Iron Man blocks Magneto's magnetic attacks. Annie tells Iron Man that they have to remove his helmet in order for her mental attacks to harm him. Using his Uni-Beam attack, Iron Man knocks down Magneto as War Machine successfully removes his helmet. Annie takes the opportunity to use her mental powers to make Magneto fall asleep for a few days. Iron Man hopes that Magneto will awaken in a plastic cell.\n\n===''Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers''===\nMagneto appears as a guest star in Episode 21 of ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]'', voiced by [[Banj\u014d Ginga]]. In the show, he is stated to be an old enemy of the X-Men, but agrees to help rescue the kids and [[Surge (comics)|Noriko Ashida]] from the Sentinels after realizing he can recruit Noriko as a member of the Brotherhood. He offers Noriko the chance to come with him and help create a world where mutants are the dominant species, but she rejects his offer, stating that Hikaru and the other children showed her that one day mutants and humans can live together in peace.\n\n==Films==\n[[File:Ianmckellenasmagneto1.jpg|thumb|left|Ian McKellen as Magneto in ''[[X-Men]]'' (2000).]]\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\nIn the ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'', Magneto is portrayed by [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]] (adult) and by [[Michael Fassbender]] (younger self).<ref>{{cite news | last = Friedman | first = Roger | title = Michael Fassbender to appear in \"X Men: First Class\" | publisher = hollywoodnews.com | date = 2010-06-24 | url = http://www.hollywoodnews.com/2010/06/24/michael-fassbender-to-appear-in-%E2%80%9Cx-men-first-class/ | accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref> His character development in the films is directly influenced by the African American human rights leader [[Malcolm X]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Boucher.|first=Geoff|title=\u2018X-Men: First Class\u2019 star: MLK and Malcolm X influenced our story [updated]|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/x-men-first-class-star-the-history-of-mlk-and-malcolm-x-influenced-our-story/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=XAVIER VS. MAGNETO: A PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATE|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/05/xavier-vs-magneto-a-philosophical-debate?page=1|}}</ref> The character's pre-teen versions were portrayed by Brett Morris (in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'') and by [[Bill Milner]] (in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''). His real name is '''Erik Magnus Lehnsherr''', which at the time was his name in the comics, and was a [[Holocaust survivors|holocaust survivor]]. Though he was good friends with [[Charles Xavier]], his objective to ensure mutant prosperity but only so long as he remains in control of it has since made them adversaries. In the ''X-Men'' films, Magneto's resistance to mental attack does not stem from his own natural powers but from his [[barbute|helmet]] which is made of a psychic shielding component. Having taken the helmet from Shaw, Magneto is rendered immune to any form of telepathy and mind control as seen in the first two film entries. His powers are much more limited when compared to his depiction in comics. Whereas he's displayed controlling magnetism to an almost unlimited degree in the comics, he is generally restricted to manipulating metal within the films. Throughout the films, despite being at odds with Xavier, Magneto displays great care towards his old friend while acknowledging his contributions to mutant kind. Magneto currently appeared in eight of the ''X-Men'' films.\n\n===''X-Men''===\nIn the film ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', Magneto is a powerful mutant whose abilities have become near limitless. He is the main antagonist of the film. But the existence of mutants have become public and the subject of a fierce debate over whether or not to be granted the same rights as others humans or whether they should be separated altogether. The [[US Senate]] is debating a Mutant Registration Act to force all mutants to reveal themselves and be registered, a move sponsored by [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]]. Magneto is present the day when attempts to convince the Senate to vote against mutant registration but is shouted down by Senator Kelly. When confronted by his old friend, Charles Xavier, he tells him that he had seen and heard the same speeches before, when the Nazis had cried out against Jews. He then asks that Xavier does not get in his way as he tries to ensure mutant supremacy. Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy installed on the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s torch. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] to use as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by [[Jean Grey]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Magneto does not believe them nor does he care. In the end, while [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] attacks Magneto atop the torch [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] uses an optic blast to knock down Magneto and destroy the machine. Magneto ends locked up in a plastic prison.\n\nBrett Morris portrayed a young Erik Lehnsherr.\n\n===''X2''===\nIn ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', Magneto returns as an antihero. After escaping from prison when Mystique had injected a suspension of iron particles into a security guard, he makes a temporary alliance with the X-Men to defeat [[William Stryker]]'s plan to kill all mutants. But once Magneto foils Stryker's attempt to use a makeshift [[Cerebro]] operated by Xavier under the mental control of Stryker's [[Jason Stryker|own son]] to kill all the mutants, he decides with Mystique to force Xavier to try to kill all normal humans. Shortly after Magneto leaves the facility in a helicopter, the X-Men intervene in time to wake up Xavier and stop Magneto's plan.\n\nFor this film, Magneto's costume and helmet were slightly redesigned for better performance due to McKellen's experience with the previous film in which found the helmet particularly uncomfortable to wear and the costume rather restricting to his movements. In addition to these costume changes, Magneto now sports a silver collar pin highly reminiscent of the designs on the character's helmet from the comics.\n\n===''X-Men: The Last Stand''===\nIn ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', Magneto is the secondary antagonist / antihero and has expanded the Brotherhood of Mutants with new recruits. After learning that a major company has produced a \"cure\" for the mutant gene, he and his Brotherhood attack the facility with the intention of killing the cure's [[Leech (comics)|source]]. Upon learning of Jean Grey's return, Magneto sets his concerns about the cure aside to sway [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] to his side; he succeeds, but is shaken when Phoenix vaporizes Xavier before his eyes. After Xavier's apparent demise, Magneto shows genuine grief over Xavier's death. During the Brotherhood's assault on Alcatraz, Magneto lifted and manipulated the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and had no qualms about endangering or sacrificing dozens of his mutant followers by knowingly sending them against anti-mutant weapons while he remained safely out of range stating that \"in chess, the [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] go first.\" During the final showdown, Wolverine and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] work together and inject Magneto with the \"cure\" which strips him of his powers. In defeat, he says to Jean 'This is what they want for all of us'. He, after feeling guilty for the bad things he has done before, then withdraws from Alcatraz with the other mutants and humans when Phoenix goes on a rampage, unleashing her powers. In the final scene, he, now alone and repented, extends his hand toward a metal chess piece and is able to slightly move it, revealing that his powers are returning.\n\n===''X-Men: First Class''===\n[[Image:Firstclassmagneto.jpg|thumb|Michael Fassbender as young Magneto in ''X-Men: First Class'' (2011).]]\n[[Michael Fassbender]] portrays a younger Erik Lensherr/Magneto in the 2011 film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''. In this film, Lensherr was separated from his parents by Nazi soldiers in a [[concentration camp]], and it was during this moment that his powers begin to manifest (twisting open a metal fence separating him and his parents). This event was witnessed by Dr. Klaus Schmidt, taking Erik aside while asking him to display his power again by moving a coin. He then threatens and executes Erik's mother in order to force an emotional display of his power. Erik spends his life after the war tracking Schmidt (who now goes by the name [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]), during which he crosses paths with Charles Xavier in 1962. He ends up recruited to \"Division X\", a CIA task force of mutants, and assists the agency in the investigation of Shaw. Erik develops a strong friendship with Xavier, and Raven; their respective codenames \"Mystique\" and \"Magneto\" were thought up by each other. Charles and Erik eventually discover Shaw plans to trigger [[World War III]] by convincing the Soviet Union to [[Cuban Missile Crisis|place nuclear missiles in Cuba]], just before Shaw attacks Division X's secret facility and forces the team's dismantlement. The remaining mutants gather in Xavier's [[X-Mansion|home estate]] planning to  oppose Shaw's plans, and Xavier helps Erik find another way to channel his innate power. During the showdown with Shaw and his men in the Caribbean, Erik pulls Shaw's nuclear submarine from the water to the beach and confronts aboard it, removing Shaw's helmet so that Xavier can access his mind and stop Shaw. In a twist of fate, Erik instead puts on Shaw's helmet and reveals that he agrees with Shaw's exclusivist ideals for mutant-kind. He then uses the same coin from the concentration camp to kill Shaw. Both United States and Soviet forces turn their weapons on the beach after witnessing the mutant confrontation. Erik stops the missiles in mid-air, but then attempts to redirect the weapons back at the human vessels, ignoring Xavier's pleas. [[Moira MacTaggert]] attempts to shoot Erik, but he deflects each shot, one of which hits Xavier in the spine and causes paralysis. As a result, he loses focus and has the missiles drop into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Lensherr leaves with Mystique and Shaw's crew. In the final scene of the film, Magneto breaks [[Emma Frost]] free from confinement while wearing a costume similar to his first appearance in the comic book.\n\nThe character was originally planned for a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film titled ''X-Men Origins: Magneto'',<ref>{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming |author2=Claude Brodesser | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117914863.html?categoryid=1238&cs=1 | title=Fox pages Turner to pen Magneto spinoff pic | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2004-12-12 | accessdate=2007-04-07 }}</ref> which after languishing on [[development hell]] was shelved for its plot being redundant with ''X-Men: First Class''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/x-men-first-class-probably-killed-x-men-origins-magneto-wolverine-2-and-deadpool-updates/ |title=\u2018X-Men: First Class\u2019 Probably Killed \u2018X-Men Origins: Magneto\u2019 |publisher=slashfilm.com |date=2010-07-25 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kit |first=Boris |title='X-Men: First Class' Writing Credits Appeal Denied |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 29, 2011 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/x-men-first-class-writing-183768 |accessdate=2011-05-11 |archivedate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z6Tdp8tH?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/x-men-first-class-writing-183768 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Bill Milner]] portrayed a 12-year-old Erik Lehnsherr.\n\n===''The Wolverine''===\nIan McKellen reprises his role in a brief cameo along with Professor Xavier in a mid-credits scene for ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]'', in which Logan returns to the United States after the film's exploits.

He and Professor Xavier decide that the best solution would be to prevent the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]' creation by stopping [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s assassination of [[Bolivar Trask]] in 1973. Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to his past self by [[Kitty Pryde]], and his past actions occur simultaneously to an incoming Sentinel attack on the mutant hideout. Magneto destroys many Sentinels by hurling the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] at them but ends up impaled by a stray fragment from a destroyed Sentinel. Retreating into the monastery, Magneto starts to fight with his wound as he tells Charles he regrets that both friends spent too many years fighting among themselves rather than seeing eye-to-eye. He remains there after having redeemed himself heroically defending his friends until the Sentinels infiltrate the stronghold right as young Xavier and Wolverine have successfully changed the future.\n\nBack in 1973, Wolverine contacts a young Xavier and a young Beast then recruit [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] to release the young but cruel and ruthless Magneto from his prison underneath [[the Pentagon]], where he had been captive since 1963 for his apparent role in the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] and of which he kept maintaining his innocence. The young Magneto helps them stop Mystique from killing Trask at the [[Paris Peace Accords]] but then decides to try killing Mystique to impede the dystopian future, betraying her and the others. After failing to kill her he decides to take matters into his own hands. He laces the prototype Sentinels with steel to control them, commandeers the Sentinels at their [[White House]] unveiling to attack the crowd, then sets the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] around the White House as a barricade. Using his powers, young Magneto controls the Sentinels against Logan and young Beast, while young Beast fight the Sentinels Logan affronts young Magneto and tries attacking him to stop him, a battle erupts while young Magneto throws several pieces of metal at Logan. Wolverine defends himself but is ultimately thrown into the Potomac River. Then young Magneto pulls the safe room out of the White House, makes a speech at the television cameras regarding mutant superiority, and prepares to kill President [[Richard Nixon]] and his cabinet. Afterward, Nixon turns out to be Mystique in disguise who shoots Magneto in the neck. Young Magneto is labeled a mutant terrorist for his attack against Nixon and the world leaders unite to hunt him down. His actions also demonstrate the threat the Sentinels pose if they are in the wrong hands and used against people, becomes one of the contributing factors that lead to the cancellation of the Sentinel program and averting the dystopian future.\n\nIn the newly-changed future, Magneto is nowhere to be seen, leaving his fate uncertain.\n\n===''X-Men: Apocalypse''===\nIn ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/04/11/x-men-apocalypse-new-details/|title='X-Men: Apocalypse': Who will return?

When he uses his powers to save a colleague at work, someone reports him to the [[Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa|police]]. His attempt to give himself up to save his family causes his daughter's mutant ability to turn the animals of the nearby forest against the police, which results in his loved ones' deaths when an arrow is accidentally fired that penetrates both his wife and daughter. Magneto kills all the officers with his daughter's locket and later journeys to his factory to do the same to the workers. He ends up being recruited by [[Apocalypse (comics)|En Sabah Nur]] after his recruiter murders the workers before taking Erik to [[Auschwitz]] and awakens his full power to serve as his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman]]. Charles Xavier tries to get in contact with his former friend by Cerebro, trying to convince him to let revenge go, only for Erik to alert En Sabah Nur to his friend's presence. He takes part in the kidnapping of his old friend, using his magnetic abilities to drag Charles' wheelchair towards them. At the command of his master, Magneto uses his improved abilities to terraform the world. Despite being approached by Mystique and his unknown son Quicksilver to help them defeat Apocalypse, he only decides to help Charles and the team when the two are attacked and nearly killed by Apocalypse. After the battle, Erik uses his abilities to rebuild the [[X-Mansion]] with Jean Grey but declines an offer from Charles to remain and takes his leave.\n\n===''Dark Phoenix''===\nIn 1992 Magneto, who realized who not all humans are evil and has became a true hero, resides on the mutant haven [[Genosha]], land which was given to him by the government as an apologize for the deaths of his wife and daughter. [[Jean Grey]] comes to his residence for an advice, asking how was he able to put aside his desire to kill others, leading Magneto to suspect her that she has killed someone, pointing out a blood stain on her shirt and he confronts her about it. Their confrontation is interrupted by the arrival of the military force, demanding to arrest Jean after she has caused a chaos during the incident in [[Red Hook, New York|Red Hook]]. Jean then nearly destroys the whole military operation after ripping out one helicopter, and Magneto struggles to send the men away. He then lashes out at Jean, banishing her from Genosha. [[Hank McCoy]] arrives at Genosha, revealing that Jean is the one who caused the death of Raven, and Magneto, along with mutants Ariki and [[Selene]], joins Hank to hunt and kill Jean. The group is confronted by the X-Men, consisting of Xavier, Storm, Scott, and Kurt. Magneto then encounters Jean, along with the D'Bari leader Vuk who controls her, now seemimgly the Dark Phoenix, and after an unsuccessful attempt to execute her, she throws him away from the building, and all the mutants are sedated and arrested by the military operation, and they are taken to a facility, aboard a train. Xavier then reveals his guilt towards his action of blocking Jean's memory, and asks for Magneto and Hank's mercy. The train is attacked by the D'Bari army and the groups unite to take them down. Magneto is later seen fighting the D'Bari forces before getting knocked off by Vuk. Jean then awakes and creating shields to protect her allies before lifting the train and crashing it to the ground. Magneto and the rest of the X-Men witness Jean's confrontation with the D'Bari and Vuk, killing them and flies to the outer space, seemingly gone. After that event, Xavier's school is renamed after Jean, and Xavier retires as the headmaster with Hank to replace him. Magneto then encounters Xavier in Paris, inviting him for a chess game, offers him his alliance after stating the sincerity Xavier has given him throughout the years, and they reconcile.\n\n==Video games==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\n* Magneto is the final boss of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[The Uncanny X-Men (video game)|Marvel's X-Men]]''.

He is voiced in the game by [[George Buza]]\n* In ''[[X-Men 2: Clone Wars]]'', Magneto served both as a boss and, for the first time in X-Men video game history, as a playable character. Upon defeating him in the third level aboard [[Asteroid M]], Magneto joins the X-Men when he discovers that his entire crew had been assimilated by the alien [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] invasion.\n* In ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'', ''[[X-Men vs. Street Fighter]]'' and in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' he returns as a playable character, toned down from his appearance in ''Children of the Atom''.

He is shown as a prisoner of The Void (a mutant prison) until he is released by Sabretooth. He is also shown in a Magnetic Flux Limiter Collar that was placed on him which ended up suppressing his magnetic powers long enough to make him more powerful. Wolverine ends up fighting him at an electrical plant.\n* Magneto appears in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' voiced by [[Tony Jay]]. Like the other characters in the game, he appears in his Ultimate costume, though his personality and his relationship with Xavier is more similar to his 616 incarnation. Mystique frees him from the U.S.S. Arbiter and he escapes to Asteroid M where he gives a televised transmission for any mutant who wants to get away from the Genetic Research and Security Organization (GRSO) to head to the Mount. When confronted by the X-Men, he fights them alongside Mystique and Sabretooth. After the defeat, Magneto and his Brotherhood get away.\n* A capeless and non-helmeted version of Magneto was a playable character in the game ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]'', voiced [[Christopher Gaze]]. In story mode, he is the last playable Marvel character in the game's story mode and like many Marvel heroes and villains in the story, is taken down and (possibly) killed (a strange \"swooshing\" sound is heard as he faints/dies, indicating that he actually indeed dies). By the most powerful Imperfect, [[Paragon (comics)|Paragon]], after she refuses his offer of an alliance (She mistakes him for [[Niles Van Roekel]], the man who kidnapped her, annihilated her village, froze her for several centuries and mutated her).

He and his Brotherhood of Mutants sided with the X-Men when Apocalypse kidnapped Quicksilver when rescuing Professor X and fighting the forces of Apocalypse. He has special dialogue with [[Zealot (Marvel Comics)|Zealot]].\n* Magneto also appeared in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' voiced by [[Dwight Schultz]]. Magneto is only playable in the DS version of the game. In this game (which is set between the ''X2'' and ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' films), Magneto teams up with the X-Men to battle the Sentinels, and also sends Sabretooth in the Master Mold to retrieve Jason Stryker to make him a member of his Brotherhood. His plan was foiled by Wolverine.\n* Originally, Magneto made a brief appearance in a cutscene in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' lying on the floor next to Professor X, both having been defeated by Doctor Doom. However, the new [[Xbox 360]] downloadable content features him (with his classic costume, 1980s costume, Ultimate costume, and Xorn as alternate costumes) as a playable character with Richard Green reprising his role. Magneto has special dialogue with Professor X and [[Fin Fang Foom]]. He also has special dialogue with [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] while triggering a disco ball in the Fun House of Murderworld, which was never used in the game. Additionally, there are unconfirmed rumors, which turns out to be a PC mod patch, created by a modder that if one uses Magneto in Mephisto's Realm after defeating Blackheart, he can save both Jean Grey and Nightcrawler, rather than letting one fall into the Void, in which other telekinetic users like [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Invisible Woman]] should have done this before.\n* Magneto appears in the [[Wii]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[PlayStation Portable]] versions of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Phil Proctor]]. He and Quicksilver have become victims of The Fold and will fight the heroes within a Repeater Tower in [[Reykjav\u00edk]], [[Iceland]]. After he and Quicksilver are defeated and cured, Magneto uses his magnetism to help the heroes get to the top of the Repeater Tower. He appears in the Vicarious Visions (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, later also PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC) versions of the game, and originally as downloadable content for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] versions, with [[Fred Tatasciore]] reprising. There is also an extra mission where the player fights Magneto, which originally as DLC as well.\n* Magneto appears in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad (video game)|Marvel Super Hero Squad]]'' video game voiced by [[Tom Kane]]. The players fight him on Asteroid M.\n* Tom Kane also plays Magneto in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'' and in ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]''. Magneto is the only character in the game not to have a DLC alternate costume. It was originally intended to be his ''[[House of M]]'' design, but it was removed following its controversial comparisons to Spain ruler Juan Carlos.\n* Magneto appears in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet]]'' video game voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver appear on Asteroid M in order to confront Magneto who mentions that the message they received is for them to contain the Space Infinity Stone which had been shattered following an attack by Doombots. When Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver reassemble it, Doctor Doom arrives and reveals that his attack on Magneto was just a ploy so that he could get the Space Infinity Gem. When Doctor Doom ends up defeated, he tricks Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch into swiping the Space Infinity Gem. Doctor Doom's attacks on Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch cause Magneto to use his magnetic abilities on Doctor Doom who reveals that he had placed Asteroid M on self-destruct. Magneto sends Doctor Doom flying where the Space Infinity Gem transports Doctor Doom to a cage. Magneto then gives his children the Space Infinity Gem. After Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver leave, Magneto claps off the self-destruct sequence.

The character was (very) loosely based on the Magneto character from the comics, and more closely resembled [[Albert Einstein]] instead of Erik Magnus Lehnsherr. This character is also not a mutant nor had any super powers. His name is pronounced \"Mag-''netto''\" instead of \"Mag-neet-o\" because he is German.\n\n===''Fantastic Four'' (1978 TV series)===\nIn the 1978 [[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|''Fantastic Four'']] animated series, Magneto (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) briefly took control of the team in \"The Menace Of Magneto\". Here, he is not depicted as a mutant. Instead he is simply an extremely powerful supervillain with typical aspirations such as robbing a bank. Instead of flying, he moves around in a bizarre, car-like device which he moves using his magnetic powers. He was defeated when [[Reed Richards]] tricked him with a wooden gun.\n\n===1980s===\n\n====''Spider-Man'' (1981 TV series)====\nThe solo [[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|''Spider-Man'']] animated series from 1981 featured Magneto in the episode \"When Magneto Speaks... People Listen\". In this version he used the alias Mr. M, took over and hid several of the world's communication satellites and demanded $100&nbsp;million in gold to return power to the world. He was defeated by Spider Man who was able to turn his magnet power back at him using a microwave relay but Magneto managed to escape.\n\n====''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends''====\nMagneto returned in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', attempting to free his fellow mutants from prison in \"The Prison Plot\". He was voiced by [[Michael Rye]]. The character also made a cameo appearance in flashback in \"A Firestar Is Born\", as [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] recounts her past to the X-Men. In spite of his Spider-Man television appearances, he has appeared in only two issues of a Spider-Man title.\n\n====''Pryde of the X-Men''====\nMagneto was the main villain in the animated X-Men pilot ''[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men]]'' - his first actual animated appearance battling the X-Men. He was voiced by [[Earl Boen]].\n\n===''X-Men'' (TV series)===\n[[Image:Magneto 1992.png|thumb|right|Magneto's 1st appearance in the show to an incarcerated Beast in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men animated series]]''.]]\nMagneto's voice was provided by [[David Hemblen]] in the series ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'', where he played a prominent role. Curiously, though he began on the show as a villain, his character spent more time as an ally to the X-Men, fighting alongside them against common enemies such as the Sentinels and Mr. Sinister as opposed to the cold-hearted villain he was previously portrayed as in earlier shows like ''Pryde of the X-Men''.\n\nIn the series, he briefly appears in the first episode \"Night of the Sentinels: Part I\" on a television screen Jubilee accidentally turns on with her powers but Magneto makes his true first appearance in the third episode \"[[Enter Magneto]]\", where he attempts to incite a war between humans and mutants by attacking a military base and launching its nuclear armaments, though they are prevented from reaching their targets by the X-Men. It is revealed that his real name is Magnus, and he is an old friend of Xavier's. However, a violent encounter with an army convinces Magnus that humans and mutants can't coexist, and the two parted ways.\n\nHe reappears in the next episode \"[[Deadly Reunions]]\", when he attacks a chemical plant in an effort to draw Xavier out to face him. After defeating Cyclops, Rogue and Storm, Xavier meets his challenge and they do battle. Though Magneto gains the upper hand, Xavier tortures him with repressed memories of his childhood during [[The Holocaust]], causing Magneto to flee in agony. In the first-season finale, he kidnaps Senator Kelly in order to once again attempt to begin a war, but is thwarted by a group of Sentinels. After Mastermold and the other Sentinels rebel against their creators and become a threat to the entire world, Magneto allies himself with the X-Men and they successfully eliminate the Sentinels, during which he saves Xavier's life.\n\nHe appears in nearly every episode in the second season, in which he and Professor Xavier have been depowered and travel throughout the Savage Land. At the end of that season, all of the X-Men save them from Mr. Sinister, and they regain their powers.\n\nIn season four, he creates Asteroid M as a safe haven for mutants who feel persecuted on Earth. Though his intentions are noble, a betrayal by his closest servant [[Fabian Cortez]] puts into motion a series of events after which he realizes that the world will never again trust him as the leader of the Asteroid, and he allows the base to be destroyed. In the fourth-season finale, Magneto teams up with Apocalypse, believing that the immortal will use his powers to resurrect his wife. When he discovers that Apocalypse plans to destroy all reality, Magneto helps the X-Men to defeat him.\n\nDisheartened by the loss of his sanctuary, he does not care about even the impending assimilation of mankind by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], until he receives news from the Beast, Forge, Mr. Sinister and Amelia Voght that his son, Quicksilver, has been kidnapped by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] in the second part of the two-part fifth-season premiere. He teams up with them to defeat the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] and save everyone they had captured or assimilated.\n\nHis final appearance is in the last episode of the series  \"Graduation Day\", he has gathered up an entire army of rebellious mutants, and is poised to conquer the world, but receives news from Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Grey that Professor Xavier is dying. Relenting, Magneto uses his power in conjunction with Xavier's in order to contact Lilandra Neramani, who takes Xavier to her planet where there is a suggestion that he may be cured. He is last seen along with the X-Men standing outside the mansion as Professor X departs.\n\nAs with many television shows, ''X-Men: The Animated Series'' has suffered from continuity errors. For one, in the episode where Magneto makes his initial appearance, aptly titled \"Enter Magneto\", the X-Men do not know him, as he is an old acquaintance of Xavier's. However, as the series progresses Magneto is shown fighting [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] during a flashback in \"Cold Comfort\". It may be possible that only Iceman knows him since he was not present in \"Enter Magneto\" and was the only one fighting Magneto in the flashback.\n\n===2000s===\n\n====''X-Men: Evolution''====\nMagneto's voice was provided by [[Christopher Judge]] in the animated television series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''.\n\nDuring the show's first season he is a shadowy, mysterious manipulator where the X-Men, except for Professor Xavier, do not know of his existence, until the first X-Man, Wolverine, figures it out, although Magneto becomes a more direct threat from the first-season finale. In the first season he uses his agent [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] to assemble [[Brotherhood of Mutants|a team of mutants]], and even recruits his own son Quicksilver to spy on them. In the first-season finale, he pits the Brotherhood against the X-Men and brings the winners to [[Asteroid M]] in an attempt to convince them to join his cause and to use a genetic enhancer to fully develop their powers as he had. His decision to leave Mystique behind leads her to betray him (although flashbacks indicate that they have been at odds since Magneto separated Mystique from her newborn son [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]), and their vendetta lasts throughout the second season.\n\nIn the second season, Magneto personally recruits a new team, the Acolytes, de-ages himself using the same technology that created [[Captain America]] as his genetic enhancements are no longer working, and finally reveals the existence of mutants to the public after the X-Men and Brotherhood fight off a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] which was meant to destroy every mutant known. In this time his daughter [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] is introduced, who hates Magneto for abandoning her as a child and leaving her in a mental asylum (when asked about what specific event led to Magneto institutionalizing Wanda, ''X-Men: Evolution'''s head writer Greg Johnson stated that \"There was no specific event. It was just years of him trying to handle a hostile, out of control child whose powers were promising to be very destructive if he didn't get her put away.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://x-men.toonzone.net/qagreg2.php |title=Beyond Evolution: X-Men Evolution |publisher=X-men.toonzone.net |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>). She hunts him down relentlessly until he uses the mutant [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] to change her memories, painting him in a new light.\n\nIn the third and fourth seasons of the show, Magneto dedicates himself to preventing the awakening of the mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], although all his attempts fail and upon Apocalypse's awakening he is transformed into one of his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]] after he is thought to have been killed by Apocalypse. He is freed of this enslavement in the finale episode \"Ascension: Part Two\", and is last seen being helped by his two children. In the final moments of the episode, Charles Xavier reveals that he witnessed the future in the mind of Apocalypse, and among the visions he saw was Magneto becoming an ally of the X-Men and training the New Mutants, like he did in the comics.\n\nIn this series, Magneto uses a device aboard [[Asteroid M]] to advance his evolution, and propelling his abilities to further heights. Evidently, this advancement pushes him onto another plateau of existing as a mutant. A claim that he references when he goes to fight Apocalypse, declaring that it is a battle between \"higher evolutionaries.\" This is enforced by Caliban's claim that Magneto is too far advanced for him to locate, but that any other mutant was still within his capabilities.\n\n====''Wolverine and the X-Men''====\nMagneto appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' voiced by [[Tom Kane]] in a rendition of [[Ian McKellen]]'s portrayal of Magneto in the X-Men films. He is shown to rule the island of Genosha, where it appears most mutants are moving to, in light of recent anti-mutant feelings. Despite the government's treatment of mutants, they seem content to allow Magneto to promote Genosha in the United States with assorted poster and commercials. It is later revealed that Magneto found Professor X unconscious on Genosha after the destruction of the X-Mansion and took to caring for him. When the X-Men arrive to \"rescue him\" Magneto turns over his care to them, stating that they are his family. When Nightcrawler arrived in Genosha, he had his daughter Scarlet Witch give him a tour. During that time, he sends Mystique to the X-Mansion to \"check up\" on Professor X. Magneto, Scarlet Witch, and the Acolytes attacked Nightcrawler when he discovered Magneto's underground cells. When Nightcrawler did a lot of teleporting to warn the X-Men, Magneto had Mystique intercept him while he prepared a special cell for Nightcrawler. Magneto gave Quicksilver and his Brotherhood of Mutants a mission. During the transmission, Quicksilver tells his father that if they pull this off, he'd better receive a warm welcome back to Genosha. In \"Battle Lines\", Magneto had a talk with Senator Kelly about holding back the powerful mutants from being sent to Genosha. He later has his Acolytes raid the MRD prisons to free the mutants. In \"Hunting Grounds\", he finds out that Scarlet Witch and Nightcrawler had been abducted by Mojo. After the rescue, Scarlet Witch persuades Magneto to let Wolverine and Nightcrawler go. In \"Backlash\", Quicksilver was not pleased with Magneto when he cuts Quicksilver's Brotherhood of Mutants loose. After a chat with Quicksilver, he has Scarlet Witch notify the MRD of the Brotherhood's hideout. In \"Aces and Eights\", Senator Kelly sends Gambit to steal Magneto's helmet. When Gambit gets away without the helmet and Magneto learns of this, he was about to pummel Senator Kelly until intervention by the X-Men prevented this, showing Magneto and Kelly the true horror of the future their actions are creating.\n\nWhile Kelly listens to reason and agrees to stop the Sentinel program, Magneto refuses to give up on his ambitions. In the three-part episode \"Foresight\", Magneto sends Mystique to pose as Senator Kelly to unleash the Sentinels on Genosha, making it appear as though Kelly started the attack. When the Sentinels attack Genosha, Magneto initially does nothing, claiming that the weak must be sacrificed so the strong can rally together. He then uses his powers to reprogram them to attack humans. He was knocked off his Sentinel by the Phoenix Force yet was rescued by Quicksilver who takes him back to Genosha. After the Phoenix Force was stopped, Scarlet Witch and Polaris had Blink teleport Magneto and Quicksilver away from Genosha. Finally seeing the corrupt and misguided nature of her father, Scarlet Witch takes control of Genosha with the islanders' full support. Though Scarlet Witch tells Quicksilver that he is always welcome in Genosha, she also states that Genosha is no longer Magneto's country; therefore banishing her own father.\n\n====''The Super Hero Squad Show''====\nMagneto appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0905/12/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Tuesday, May 12, 2009 |publisher=Comicscontinuum.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> Besides being depicted as an ally of [[Doctor Doom]], this version is shown trying to train his children Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to follow his legacy. In \"Hexed, Vexed, and Perplexed\", he arrived in Super Hero City with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in a plot to steal the Infinity Fractals from the Vault for Doctor Doom. He ends up fighting Captain America, Hawkeye, and the Super Hero Squad. When [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] makes an attack on Magneto, Quicksilver uses his super speed to deflect the attack back at Falcon. Magneto sends his children to infiltrate the Helicarrier to steal the security codes in order to infiltrate the Vault. When the Super Hero Squad attacks, Magneto grabs an Infinity Fractal which gives him the ability to control matter which he uses to stop Falcon in mid-air. Scarlet Witch objects to Magneto hurting him more. Magneto releases them from his control only to take Falcon and Redwing captive as Quicksilver grabs the Infinity Fractals. Magneto then traps the Super Hero Squad in metal. Quicksilver discovers that Magneto had stolen the Infinity Fractals all along. Doctor Doom later attacks Magneto blaming him for stealing the Infinity Fractals until Falcon makes off with them. Doctor Doom holds Magneto responsible for his children helping Falcon and knocks him out. In \"Lo, How the Mighty Hath Abdicated!\", Magneto and Quicksilver attack the Helicarrier thinking that Scarlet Witch was kidnapped and brainwashed by the Super Hero Squad. Their fight ends up crashing the Helicarrier into Asgard. When Odin is freed from Enchantress' love lutefisk, he convinces Magneto to let Scarlet Witch stay with the Super Hero Squad. When Scarlet Witch states that she will come to Magneto when he needs her, Magneto states that if they meet as hero and villain, it will be different. Due to his transportation being wrecked, Magneto and Quicksilver ask the Super Hero Squad for a ride back to Super Hero City. A vastly older version appears in the alternate universe episode \"Days, Nights, and Weekends of Futures Past\", where he helps Falcon, HERBIE, and Reptil (known as \"The Man\") reform Scarlet Witch. Here, he is seen using a [[Walker (mobility)|zimmer frame]], complete with a bicycle horn, but later uses a scooter composed of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] pieces.\n\n===2010s===\n\n====''Marvel Anime''====\nMagneto was referenced in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''. In \"Conflict,\" Cyclops mentions that Magneto is in a special plastic cell when discussing on how a metal bridge was twisted in a different direction. In a post-credits scene to \"Destiny,\" it is revealed that Magneto's plastic prison has been destroyed and he has escaped.\n\n====''Iron Man: Armored Adventures''====\nMagneto appears in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode \"The X-Factor\" voiced by [[Ron Halder]], also in a rendition of McKellen from the films. His alias includes Magnus, Max Eisenhart and Erik Lensherr and it is mentioned he was a victim of the [[Weapon X]] program (like the Ultimate version), and is considered to be as dangerous as [[Doctor Doom]], as revealed when Pepper looks up his [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] profile. Iron Man encounters Magneto in a parking lot having bounded anti-mutant activist [[Simon Trask]] with a metal pipe and ends up attacked by Magneto with the battle ending with Iron Man dropped into the trash cans. He was targeting Annie Clairmont (who was an alias for [[Jean Grey]]) and ends up catching up to her when she was at a diner with Tony Stark, [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], and [[Pepper Potts]]. Tony Stark becomes Iron Man while Magneto pursues Annie, Pepper, and James. When Iron Man arrives, Magneto uses his magnetic abilities on Iron Man and tries to constrict him. Annie tries to use her telekinesis to help Ironman but Magneto sends the metal objects  back at them. As Iron Man shuts down, Magneto uses his magnetic abilities to make off with Annie. At Magneto's hideaway, Magneto shows Annie the footage of Senator Robert Kelly's campaign against mutants and recaps his history of being experimented upon. When Annie tries to make mental contact with Iron Man, Magneto reveals to Annie that he had his hideout lined with the same mental-deflecting metal used for his helmet. Magneto plans to have Annie help him wage war against the humans one way or the other. When Iron Man and War Machine find Magneto's hideout, they get a mental message from Annie telling him where Magneto is. Using a special armor, Iron Man fights Magneto with War Machine's help. Both Iron Man and War Machine had a hard time fighting Magneto and his magnetic powers. Using his special force field, Iron Man blocks Magneto's magnetic attacks. Annie tells Iron Man that they have to remove his helmet in order for her mental attacks to harm him. Using his Uni-Beam attack, Iron Man knocks down Magneto as War Machine successfully removes his helmet. Annie takes the opportunity to use her mental powers to make Magneto fall asleep for a few days. Iron Man hopes that Magneto will awaken in a plastic cell.\n\n===''Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers''===\nMagneto appears as a guest star in Episode 21 of ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]'', voiced by [[Banj\u014d Ginga]]. In the show, he is stated to be an old enemy of the X-Men, but agrees to help rescue the kids and [[Surge (comics)|Noriko Ashida]] from the Sentinels after realizing he can recruit Noriko as a member of the Brotherhood. He offers Noriko the chance to come with him and help create a world where mutants are the dominant species, but she rejects his offer, stating that Hikaru and the other children showed her that one day mutants and humans can live together in peace.\n\n==Films==\n[[File:Ianmckellenasmagneto1.jpg|thumb|left|Ian McKellen as Magneto in ''[[X-Men]]'' (2000).]]\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\nIn the ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'', Magneto is portrayed by [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]] (adult) and by [[Michael Fassbender]] (younger self).<ref>{{cite news | last = Friedman | first = Roger | title = Michael Fassbender to appear in \"X Men: First Class\" | publisher = hollywoodnews.com | date = 2010-06-24 | url = http://www.hollywoodnews.com/2010/06/24/michael-fassbender-to-appear-in-%E2%80%9Cx-men-first-class/ | accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref> His character development in the films is directly influenced by the African American human rights leader [[Malcolm X]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Boucher.|first=Geoff|title=\u2018X-Men: First Class\u2019 star: MLK and Malcolm X influenced our story [updated]|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/x-men-first-class-star-the-history-of-mlk-and-malcolm-x-influenced-our-story/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=XAVIER VS. MAGNETO: A PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATE|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/05/xavier-vs-magneto-a-philosophical-debate?page=1|}}</ref> The character's pre-teen versions were portrayed by Brett Morris (in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'') and by [[Bill Milner]] (in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''). His real name is '''Erik Magnus Lehnsherr''', which at the time was his name in the comics, and was a [[Holocaust survivors|holocaust survivor]]. Though he was good friends with [[Charles Xavier]], his objective to ensure mutant prosperity but only so long as he remains in control of it has since made them adversaries. In the ''X-Men'' films, Magneto's resistance to mental attack does not stem from his own natural powers but from his [[barbute|helmet]] which is made of a psychic shielding component. Having taken the helmet from Shaw, Magneto is rendered immune to any form of telepathy and mind control as seen in the first two film entries. His powers are much more limited when compared to his depiction in comics. Whereas he's displayed controlling magnetism to an almost unlimited degree in the comics, he is generally restricted to manipulating metal within the films. Throughout the films, despite being at odds with Xavier, Magneto displays great care towards his old friend while acknowledging his contributions to mutant kind. Magneto currently appeared in eight of the ''X-Men'' films.\n\n===''X-Men''===\nIn the film ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', Magneto is a powerful mutant whose abilities have become near limitless. He is the main antagonist of the film. But the existence of mutants have become public and the subject of a fierce debate over whether or not to be granted the same rights as others humans or whether they should be separated altogether. The [[US Senate]] is debating a Mutant Registration Act to force all mutants to reveal themselves and be registered, a move sponsored by [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]]. Magneto is present the day when attempts to convince the Senate to vote against mutant registration but is shouted down by Senator Kelly. When confronted by his old friend, Charles Xavier, he tells him that he had seen and heard the same speeches before, when the Nazis had cried out against Jews. He then asks that Xavier does not get in his way as he tries to ensure mutant supremacy. Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy installed on the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s torch. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] to use as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by [[Jean Grey]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Magneto does not believe them nor does he care. In the end, while [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] attacks Magneto atop the torch [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] uses an optic blast to knock down Magneto and destroy the machine. Magneto ends locked up in a plastic prison.\n\nBrett Morris portrayed a young Erik Lehnsherr.\n\n===''X2''===\nIn ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', Magneto returns as an antihero. After escaping from prison when Mystique had injected a suspension of iron particles into a security guard, he makes a temporary alliance with the X-Men to defeat [[William Stryker]]'s plan to kill all mutants. But once Magneto foils Stryker's attempt to use a makeshift [[Cerebro]] operated by Xavier under the mental control of Stryker's [[Jason Stryker|own son]] to kill all the mutants, he decides with Mystique to force Xavier to try to kill all normal humans. Shortly after Magneto leaves the facility in a helicopter, the X-Men intervene in time to wake up Xavier and stop Magneto's plan.\n\nFor this film, Magneto's costume and helmet were slightly redesigned for better performance due to McKellen's experience with the previous film in which found the helmet particularly uncomfortable to wear and the costume rather restricting to his movements. In addition to these costume changes, Magneto now sports a silver collar pin highly reminiscent of the designs on the character's helmet from the comics.\n\n===''X-Men: The Last Stand''===\nIn ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', Magneto is the secondary antagonist / antihero and has expanded the Brotherhood of Mutants with new recruits. After learning that a major company has produced a \"cure\" for the mutant gene, he and his Brotherhood attack the facility with the intention of killing the cure's [[Leech (comics)|source]]. Upon learning of Jean Grey's return, Magneto sets his concerns about the cure aside to sway [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] to his side; he succeeds, but is shaken when Phoenix vaporizes Xavier before his eyes. After Xavier's apparent demise, Magneto shows genuine grief over Xavier's death. During the Brotherhood's assault on Alcatraz, Magneto lifted and manipulated the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and had no qualms about endangering or sacrificing dozens of his mutant followers by knowingly sending them against anti-mutant weapons while he remained safely out of range stating that \"in chess, the [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] go first.\" During the final showdown, Wolverine and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] work together and inject Magneto with the \"cure\" which strips him of his powers. In defeat, he says to Jean 'This is what they want for all of us'. He, after feeling guilty for the bad things he has done before, then withdraws from Alcatraz with the other mutants and humans when Phoenix goes on a rampage, unleashing her powers. In the final scene, he, now alone and repented, extends his hand toward a metal chess piece and is able to slightly move it, revealing that his powers are returning.\n\n===''X-Men: First Class''===\n[[Image:Firstclassmagneto.jpg|thumb|Michael Fassbender as young Magneto in ''X-Men: First Class'' (2011).]]\n[[Michael Fassbender]] portrays a younger Erik Lensherr/Magneto in the 2011 film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''. In this film, Lensherr was separated from his parents by Nazi soldiers in a [[concentration camp]], and it was during this moment that his powers begin to manifest (twisting open a metal fence separating him and his parents). This event was witnessed by Dr. Klaus Schmidt, taking Erik aside while asking him to display his power again by moving a coin. He then threatens and executes Erik's mother in order to force an emotional display of his power. Erik spends his life after the war tracking Schmidt (who now goes by the name [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]), during which he crosses paths with Charles Xavier in 1962. He ends up recruited to \"Division X\", a CIA task force of mutants, and assists the agency in the investigation of Shaw. Erik develops a strong friendship with Xavier, and Raven; their respective codenames \"Mystique\" and \"Magneto\" were thought up by each other. Charles and Erik eventually discover Shaw plans to trigger [[World War III]] by convincing the Soviet Union to [[Cuban Missile Crisis|place nuclear missiles in Cuba]], just before Shaw attacks Division X's secret facility and forces the team's dismantlement. The remaining mutants gather in Xavier's [[X-Mansion|home estate]] planning to  oppose Shaw's plans, and Xavier helps Erik find another way to channel his innate power. During the showdown with Shaw and his men in the Caribbean, Erik pulls Shaw's nuclear submarine from the water to the beach and confronts aboard it, removing Shaw's helmet so that Xavier can access his mind and stop Shaw. In a twist of fate, Erik instead puts on Shaw's helmet and reveals that he agrees with Shaw's exclusivist ideals for mutant-kind. He then uses the same coin from the concentration camp to kill Shaw. Both United States and Soviet forces turn their weapons on the beach after witnessing the mutant confrontation. Erik stops the missiles in mid-air, but then attempts to redirect the weapons back at the human vessels, ignoring Xavier's pleas. [[Moira MacTaggert]] attempts to shoot Erik, but he deflects each shot, one of which hits Xavier in the spine and causes paralysis. As a result, he loses focus and has the missiles drop into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Lensherr leaves with Mystique and Shaw's crew. In the final scene of the film, Magneto breaks [[Emma Frost]] free from confinement while wearing a costume similar to his first appearance in the comic book.\n\nThe character was originally planned for a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film titled ''X-Men Origins: Magneto'',<ref>{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming |author2=Claude Brodesser | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117914863.html?categoryid=1238&cs=1 | title=Fox pages Turner to pen Magneto spinoff pic | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2004-12-12 | accessdate=2007-04-07 }}</ref> which after languishing on [[development hell]] was shelved for its plot being redundant with ''X-Men: First Class''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/x-men-first-class-probably-killed-x-men-origins-magneto-wolverine-2-and-deadpool-updates/ |title=\u2018X-Men: First Class\u2019 Probably Killed \u2018X-Men Origins: Magneto\u2019 |publisher=slashfilm.com |date=2010-07-25 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kit |first=Boris |title='X-Men: First Class' Writing Credits Appeal Denied |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 29, 2011 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/x-men-first-class-writing-183768 |accessdate=2011-05-11 |archivedate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z6Tdp8tH?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/x-men-first-class-writing-183768 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Bill Milner]] portrayed a 12-year-old Erik Lehnsherr.\n\n===''The Wolverine''===\nIan McKellen reprises his role in a brief cameo along with Professor Xavier in a mid-credits scene for ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]'', in which Logan returns to the United States after the film's exploits.

He and Professor Xavier decide that the best solution would be to prevent the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]' creation by stopping [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s assassination of [[Bolivar Trask]] in 1973. Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to his past self by [[Kitty Pryde]], and his past actions occur simultaneously to an incoming Sentinel attack on the mutant hideout. Magneto destroys many Sentinels by hurling the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] at them but ends up impaled by a stray fragment from a destroyed Sentinel. Retreating into the monastery, Magneto starts to fight with his wound as he tells Charles he regrets that both friends spent too many years fighting among themselves rather than seeing eye-to-eye. He remains there after having redeemed himself heroically defending his friends until the Sentinels infiltrate the stronghold right as young Xavier and Wolverine have successfully changed the future.\n\nBack in 1973, Wolverine contacts a young Xavier and a young Beast then recruit [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] to release the young but cruel and ruthless Magneto from his prison underneath [[the Pentagon]], where he had been captive since 1963 for his apparent role in the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] and of which he kept maintaining his innocence. The young Magneto helps them stop Mystique from killing Trask at the [[Paris Peace Accords]] but then decides to try killing Mystique to impede the dystopian future, betraying her and the others. After failing to kill her he decides to take matters into his own hands. He laces the prototype Sentinels with steel to control them, commandeers the Sentinels at their [[White House]] unveiling to attack the crowd, then sets the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] around the White House as a barricade. Using his powers, young Magneto controls the Sentinels against Logan and young Beast, while young Beast fight the Sentinels Logan affronts young Magneto and tries attacking him to stop him, a battle erupts while young Magneto throws several pieces of metal at Logan. Wolverine defends himself but is ultimately thrown into the Potomac River. Then young Magneto pulls the safe room out of the White House, makes a speech at the television cameras regarding mutant superiority, and prepares to kill President [[Richard Nixon]] and his cabinet. Afterward, Nixon turns out to be Mystique in disguise who shoots Magneto in the neck. Young Magneto is labeled a mutant terrorist for his attack against Nixon and the world leaders unite to hunt him down. His actions also demonstrate the threat the Sentinels pose if they are in the wrong hands and used against people, becomes one of the contributing factors that lead to the cancellation of the Sentinel program and averting the dystopian future.\n\nIn the newly-changed future, Magneto is nowhere to be seen, leaving his fate uncertain.\n\n===''X-Men: Apocalypse''===\nIn ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/04/11/x-men-apocalypse-new-details/|title='X-Men: Apocalypse': Who will return? What new mutants may appear? Scoop on the next X-Men film -- Exclusive|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 11, 2014|accessdate=2014-04-11}}</ref> Magneto spent the next ten years after the [[X-Men: Days of Future Past|1970s events]] living in [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] as a metalworker under the alias \"Henryk\" and a wife and daughter; his wife aware of his past and his daughter possessing an undefined mutant ability to command animals. When he uses his powers to save a colleague at work, someone reports him to the [[Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa|police]]. His attempt to give himself up to save his family causes his daughter's mutant ability to turn the animals of the nearby forest against the police, which results in his loved ones' deaths when an arrow is accidentally fired that penetrates both his wife and daughter. Magneto kills all the officers with his daughter's locket and later journeys to his factory to do the same to the workers. He ends up being recruited by [[Apocalypse (comics)|En Sabah Nur]] after his recruiter murders the workers before taking Erik to [[Auschwitz]] and awakens his full power to serve as his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman]]. Charles Xavier tries to get in contact with his former friend by Cerebro, trying to convince him to let revenge go, only for Erik to alert En Sabah Nur to his friend's presence. He takes part in the kidnapping of his old friend, using his magnetic abilities to drag Charles' wheelchair towards them. At the command of his master, Magneto uses his improved abilities to terraform the world. Despite being approached by Mystique and his unknown son Quicksilver to help them defeat Apocalypse, he only decides to help Charles and the team when the two are attacked and nearly killed by Apocalypse. After the battle, Erik uses his abilities to rebuild the [[X-Mansion]] with Jean Grey but declines an offer from Charles to remain and takes his leave.\n\n===''Dark Phoenix''===\nFassbender reprises his role in 2019's ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]''. Magneto resides on the mutant haven [[Genosha]] by the time of the movie's story. [[Jean Grey]] comes to his residence for an advice, asking how was he able to put aside his desire to kill others, leading Magneto to suspect her that she has killed someone, pointing out a blood stain on her shirt and he confronts her about it. Their confrontation is interrupted by the arrival of the military force, demanding to arrest Jean after she has caused a chaos during the incident in [[Red Hook, New York|Red Hook]]. Jean then nearly destroys the whole military operation after ripping out one helicopter, and Magneto struggles to send the men away. He then lashes out at Jean, banishing her from Genosha. [[Hank McCoy]] arrives at Genosha, revealing that Jean is the one who caused the death of Raven, and Magneto, along with mutants Ariki and [[Selene]], joins Hank to hunt and kill Jean. The group is confronted by the X-Men, consisting of Xavier, Storm, Scott, and Kurt. Magneto then encounters Jean, along with the D'Bari leader Vuk who controls her, now seemimgly the Dark Phoenix, and after an unsuccessful attempt to execute her, she throws him away from the building, and all the mutants are sedated and arrested by the military operation, and they are taken to a facility, aboard a train. Xavier then reveals his guilt towards his action of blocking Jean's memory, and asks for Magneto and Hank's mercy. The train is attacked by the D'Bari army and the groups unite to take them down. Magneto is later seen fighting the D'Bari forces before getting knocked off by Vuk. Jean then awakes and creating shields to protect her allies before lifting the train and crashing it to the ground. Magneto and the rest of the X-Men witness Jean's confrontation with the D'Bari and Vuk, killing them and flies to the outer space, seemingly gone. After that event, Xavier's school is renamed after Jean, and Xavier retires as the headmaster with Hank to replace him. Magneto then encounters Xavier in Paris, inviting him for a chess game, offers him his alliance after stating the sincerity Xavier has given him throughout the years, and they reconcile.\n\n==Video games==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\n* Magneto is the final boss of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[The Uncanny X-Men (video game)|Marvel's X-Men]]''. However, players could only access his level via a special code input at the level selection screen.\n* Magneto was one of the main villains in ''[[X-Men: Madness in Murderworld]]''.\n* Magneto is the final boss of the [[X-Men (arcade game)|''X-Men'' arcade game]]. He kidnaps [[Professor X]] and [[Kitty Pryde]] during the first two stages, prompting the heroes to go on a rescue mission.\n* Magneto is the final boss of the [[Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]] game, ''[[X-Men (1993 video game)|X-Men]]''. However, after defeating [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], players must softly press the reset button on the console to delete a computer virus emitted on Mojo's level before time runs out, in order to face him.\n* Magneto is the final boss of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game ''[[X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse]]''.\n* Magneto appears in ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''. He was the non-playable boss of the game whom the players must defeat at his [[space station]] [[Providence (comics)|Avalon]]. His abilities rendered him very difficult to defeat. He is voiced in the game by [[George Buza]]\n* In ''[[X-Men 2: Clone Wars]]'', Magneto served both as a boss and, for the first time in X-Men video game history, as a playable character. Upon defeating him in the third level aboard [[Asteroid M]], Magneto joins the X-Men when he discovers that his entire crew had been assimilated by the alien [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] invasion.\n* In ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'', ''[[X-Men vs. Street Fighter]]'' and in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' he returns as a playable character, toned down from his appearance in ''Children of the Atom''. He is also a selectable assist character in the first ''[[Marvel Vs. Capcom]]'' game. Lome Kennedy plays him in all these titles.\n* In the ''[[Quake (series)|Quake]]'' conversion ''[[X-Men: The Ravages of Apocalypse]]'', the player played a cyborg created by and working for Magneto.\n* Magneto appears [[X-Men: Next Dimension]], voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].\n* Magneto appears as a boss in ''[[X2: Wolverine's Revenge]]'', reprised by Fred Tatasciore. He is shown as a prisoner of The Void (a mutant prison) until he is released by Sabretooth. He is also shown in a Magnetic Flux Limiter Collar that was placed on him which ended up suppressing his magnetic powers long enough to make him more powerful. Wolverine ends up fighting him at an electrical plant.\n* Magneto appears in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' voiced by [[Tony Jay]]. Like the other characters in the game, he appears in his Ultimate costume, though his personality and his relationship with Xavier is more similar to his 616 incarnation. Mystique frees him from the U.S.S. Arbiter and he escapes to Asteroid M where he gives a televised transmission for any mutant who wants to get away from the Genetic Research and Security Organization (GRSO) to head to the Mount. When confronted by the X-Men, he fights them alongside Mystique and Sabretooth. After the defeat, Magneto and his Brotherhood get away.\n* A capeless and non-helmeted version of Magneto was a playable character in the game ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]'', voiced [[Christopher Gaze]]. In story mode, he is the last playable Marvel character in the game's story mode and like many Marvel heroes and villains in the story, is taken down and (possibly) killed (a strange \"swooshing\" sound is heard as he faints/dies, indicating that he actually indeed dies). By the most powerful Imperfect, [[Paragon (comics)|Paragon]], after she refuses his offer of an alliance (She mistakes him for [[Niles Van Roekel]], the man who kidnapped her, annihilated her village, froze her for several centuries and mutated her). In the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version of the game he still has his helmet.\n\n[[Image:Magneto Legends.PNG|right|thumbnail|Magneto as a playable character in the video game ''X-Men Legends II''.]]\n* In ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'', Magneto (voiced by [[Richard Green (actor)|Richard Green]]) was made the main playable character as part of the game's Brotherhood. He and his Brotherhood of Mutants sided with the X-Men when Apocalypse kidnapped Quicksilver when rescuing Professor X and fighting the forces of Apocalypse. He has special dialogue with [[Zealot (Marvel Comics)|Zealot]].\n* Magneto also appeared in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' voiced by [[Dwight Schultz]]. Magneto is only playable in the DS version of the game. In this game (which is set between the ''X2'' and ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' films), Magneto teams up with the X-Men to battle the Sentinels, and also sends Sabretooth in the Master Mold to retrieve Jason Stryker to make him a member of his Brotherhood. His plan was foiled by Wolverine.\n* Originally, Magneto made a brief appearance in a cutscene in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' lying on the floor next to Professor X, both having been defeated by Doctor Doom. However, the new [[Xbox 360]] downloadable content features him (with his classic costume, 1980s costume, Ultimate costume, and Xorn as alternate costumes) as a playable character with Richard Green reprising his role. Magneto has special dialogue with Professor X and [[Fin Fang Foom]]. He also has special dialogue with [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] while triggering a disco ball in the Fun House of Murderworld, which was never used in the game. Additionally, there are unconfirmed rumors, which turns out to be a PC mod patch, created by a modder that if one uses Magneto in Mephisto's Realm after defeating Blackheart, he can save both Jean Grey and Nightcrawler, rather than letting one fall into the Void, in which other telekinetic users like [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Invisible Woman]] should have done this before.\n* Magneto appears in the [[Wii]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[PlayStation Portable]] versions of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Phil Proctor]]. He and Quicksilver have become victims of The Fold and will fight the heroes within a Repeater Tower in [[Reykjav\u00edk]], [[Iceland]]. After he and Quicksilver are defeated and cured, Magneto uses his magnetism to help the heroes get to the top of the Repeater Tower. He appears in the Vicarious Visions (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, later also PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC) versions of the game, and originally as downloadable content for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] versions, with [[Fred Tatasciore]] reprising. There is also an extra mission where the player fights Magneto, which originally as DLC as well.\n* Magneto appears in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad (video game)|Marvel Super Hero Squad]]'' video game voiced by [[Tom Kane]]. The players fight him on Asteroid M.\n* Tom Kane also plays Magneto in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'' and in ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]''. Magneto is the only character in the game not to have a DLC alternate costume. It was originally intended to be his ''[[House of M]]'' design, but it was removed following its controversial comparisons to Spain ruler Juan Carlos.\n* Magneto appears in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet]]'' video game voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver appear on Asteroid M in order to confront Magneto who mentions that the message they received is for them to contain the Space Infinity Stone which had been shattered following an attack by Doombots. When Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver reassemble it, Doctor Doom arrives and reveals that his attack on Magneto was just a ploy so that he could get the Space Infinity Gem. When Doctor Doom ends up defeated, he tricks Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch into swiping the Space Infinity Gem. Doctor Doom's attacks on Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch cause Magneto to use his magnetic abilities on Doctor Doom who reveals that he had placed Asteroid M on self-destruct. Magneto sends Doctor Doom flying where the Space Infinity Gem transports Doctor Doom to a cage. Magneto then gives his children the Space Infinity Gem. After Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver leave, Magneto claps off the self-destruct sequence. In the DS Version, he is a playable character on the last level of Challenge Mode.\n* Magneto appears as both a playable character and a boss in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad Online]]''.\n* Magneto is available as downloadable content for the game ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'', as part of \"Marvel Costume Kit 4\".<ref name=\"LittleBigPlanetMCK4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.littlebigplanet.com/en/downloadable_content_items/1084?t=US |title=Marvel Costume Kit 4 |publisher=[[Sony]] |accessdate=2012-12-30 |archivedate=2012-12-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DHLCsBiN?url=http://www.littlebigplanet.com/en/downloadable_content_items/1084?t=US |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Magneto appears as a non-playable character in ''[[X-Men: Destiny]]'' voiced by Bill Graves.\n* Magneto is featured as an unlockable character and a boss in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''.\n* Magneto appears as a playable character in the 2012 [[fighting game]] ''[[Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth]]'' voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].\n* Magneto appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref name=\"legomarvelsuperheroes\">{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8c-9pM7VPA |title=Lego Marvel Super Heroes Trailer - Game Informer Coverage |date=January 8, 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref> Magneto leads the Brotherhood of Mutants and the generic Acolytes in raiding the X-Mansion to steal the Tesseract. He is successful in his mission as he and Mystique escape with the Tesseract. Magneto uses the [[Statue of Liberty]] to attack Hulk, Mister Fantastic, and Wolverine. After Mastermind is defeated, Magneto tosses the head into the city and flees to the island where Asteroid M is. Mystique poses as Magneto while the real one heads into space on Asteroid M. When on Asteroid M, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Thor defeat Magneto. Magneto is among the villains that help to fight Galactus. Afterward, the villains are given time to escape before they are pursued. In a bonus mission at the Raft, Magneto and Mystique infiltrate the Raft when Magneto suspects that Mysterio has his chess set that Magneto had left behind during his escape and confrontation with the heroes. Mysterio is reluctant to give Magneto his chess set back, causing Magneto and Mystique to fight past the inmates to get to Mysterio. Magneto and Mystique defeat Mysterio as Magneto reclaims his chess set.\n* Magneto also appears as both a boss and a playable character in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'' with James Arnold Taylor reprising his role.\n* Magneto is a playable character in the 2014 fighting game ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]''.\n* Magneto is a playable character in ''[[Marvel: Future Fight]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.marvel.com/games/66403/x-men-join-battle-marvel-future-fight/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731070434/https://news.marvel.com/games/66403/x-men-join-battle-marvel-future-fight/ |archive-date=2017-07-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Magneto will appear as a playable character in ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order]]'', with Tom Kane reprising his role.

The earliest may have been for grain storage and possibly was succeeded by a [[Roman temple]] built by [[Mercurius Augustus]]. From the 4th century on, however, the site was occupied by Christian buildings, including a square edifice known as the \"oldest cathedral\" that was commissioned by [[Maternus of Cologne|Maternus]], the first bishop of Cologne. A free-standing [[baptistery]] dating back to the 7th century was located at the east end of the present cathedral but was demolished in the 9th century to build the second cathedral. During excavations of the present cathedral, graves were discovered in the location of the oldest portion of the building; including that of a boy that was richly adorned with [[grave goods]] and another of a woman, popularly thought to be [[Wisigard]]. Both graves are thought to be from the 6th century. Only ruins of the baptistery and the octagonal [[baptismal font]] remain today.{{Citation needed|reason=No source given to back new addition re graves|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe second church, called the \"Old Cathedral\", was completed in 818. It was destroyed by fire on 30 April 1248, during demolition work to prepare for a new cathedral.\n\n=== Medieval beginning ===\n\nIn 1164, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Rainald of Dassel]], acquired the relics of the [[Three Kings]] which the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], had taken from the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]], Milan, Italy. (Parts of the relics have since been returned to Milan.) The relics have great religious significance and drew pilgrims from all over [[Christendom]]. It was important to church officials that they be properly housed, and thus began a building program in the new style of [[Gothic architecture]], based in particular on the French cathedral of [[Amiens Cathedral|Amiens]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe [[foundation stone]] was laid on 15 August 1248, by Archbishop [[Konrad von Hochstaden]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cologne.de/what-to-do/the-cologne-cathedral.html |title=The Cologne Cathedral |publisher=Cologne.de |accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> The eastern arm was completed under the direction of [[Master Gerhard]], was consecrated in 1322 and sealed off by a temporary wall so it could be used as the work continued.

Badly damaged, it nevertheless remained standing in an otherwise completely flattened city. The twin spires were an easily recognizable navigational landmark for Allied aircraft bombing.\n\nOn 6 March 1945, an area west of the cathedral (Marzellenstrasse/Trankgasse) was the site of intense combat between American tanks of the [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] and a [[Panther Tank|Panther Ausf.

The Panther successfully knocked out a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]], killing three men, before it was destroyed by a [[M26 Pershing|T26E3 Pershing]] hours later. Footage of that battle survives.

An emergency repair to the base of the northwest tower, carried out in 1944 using poor-quality brick taken from a nearby ruined building, remained visible as a reminder of the war until 2005, when it was decided to restore the section to its original appearance.\n\nRepair and maintenance work is constantly being carried out in one or another section of the building, which is rarely completely free of scaffolding, as wind, rain, and pollution slowly eat away at the stones.

The plan is in the shape of a [[Latin Cross]], as is usual with Gothic cathedrals. It has two aisles on either side, which help to support one of the very highest Gothic vaults in the world, being nearly as tall as that of the [[Beauvais Cathedral]], much of which collapsed. Externally the outward thrust of the vault is taken by [[flying buttress]]es in the French manner. The eastern end has a single ambulatory, the second aisle resolving into a ''[[chevet]]'' of seven radiating chapels.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nInternally, the medieval choir is more varied and less mechanical in its details than the 19th-century building. It presents a French style arrangement of very tall [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]], a delicate narrow [[triforium]] gallery lit by windows and with detailed tracery merging with that of the windows above. The [[clerestory]] windows are tall and retain some old figurative glass in the lower sections. The whole is united by the tall shafts that sweep unbroken from the floor to their capitals at the spring of the vault. The vault is of plain quadripartite arrangement.\n\nThe choir retains a great many of its original fittings, including the carved stalls, which is made the more surprising by the fact that French Revolutionary troops had desecrated the building. A large stone statue of [[St Christopher]] looks down towards the place where the earlier entrance to the cathedral was, before its completion in the late 19th century.\n\nThe nave has many 19th century stained glass windows. A set of five on the south side, called the ''Bayernfenster'', were a gift from [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]], and strongly represent the painterly German style of that date.\n\nExternally, particularly from a distance, the building is dominated by its huge spires, which are entirely Germanic in character, being openwork like those of [[Ulm Minster|Ulm]], [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Vienna]], [[Strasbourg cathedral|Strasbourg]] and [[Regensburg Cathedral]]s.<ref>Wim Swaan,{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Banister Fletcher{{page needed|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\" widths=\"270px\">\nFile:Cologne cathedral aerial (25326253726).jpg|A \"Bird's eye view\" shows the cruciform plan\nFile:Cologne cathedrale vue sud.jpg|The cathedral from the south\nFile:Koelner-dom-spire.jpg|The exterior of one of the spires\nFile:Cathedral main entrance.jpg|The main entrance shows the 19th century decoration\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"250px\" widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg|The flying buttresses and pinnacles of the Medieval east end\nFile:Koelner Dom Innenraum.jpg|The [[nave]] looking east\nFile:Cologne Cathedral interior.JPG|Interior of the Medieval east end, showing the extreme height\nFile:Koelner dom neue orgel.jpg|This \"swallows' nest\" organ was built into the gallery in 1998, to celebrate the cathedral's 750 years\n</gallery>\n\n== Dimensions ==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =\n | image1    = Jahrbuch MZK Band 03 - Gew\u00f6lbesystem - Fig 75 Chordurchschnitt des Domes zu C\u00f6ln - S\u00fcdseite.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = 19th century cross-section, south elevation of the choir\n | image2    = Plan.cathedrale.Cologne.png\n | width2    = 255\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = Groundplan\n }}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"width:12em\"|External length||align=\"right\"| {{convert|144.58|m|ft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|External width||align=\"right\"| {{convert|86.25|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Width of west fa\u00e7ade||align=\"right\"| {{convert|61.54|m|ft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Width of [[transept]] fa\u00e7ade||align=\"right\"| {{convert|39.95|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Width of [[nave]] (with aisles, interior)||align=\"right\"| {{convert|45.19|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of southern tower||align=\"right\"| {{convert|157.31|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of northern tower||align=\"right\"| {{convert|157.38|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of ridge turret||align=\"right\"| {{convert|109.00|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of transept fa\u00e7ades||align=\"right\"| {{convert|69.95|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of roof ridge||align=\"right\"| {{convert|61.10|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Inner height of nave||align=\"right\"| {{convert|43.35|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Building area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|7914|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Window surface area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|10000|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Roof surface area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|12000|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Gross volume without buttresses||align=\"right\"| {{convert|407000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|}\n\n== Treasures{{anchor | Treasures of Cologne Cathedral}} ==\nOne of the treasures of the cathedral is the High Altar, which was installed in 1322.

It is traditionally believed to hold the remains of the [[Three Wise Men]], whose relics were acquired by [[Frederick Barbarossa]] at the conquest of Milan in 1164.   The shrine takes the form a large [[reliquary]] in the shape of a basilican church, made of bronze and silver, gilded and ornamented with architectonic details, figurative sculpture, enamels and gemstones.

The first was the 3.8-tonne ''Dreik\u00f6nigsglocke'' (\"Bell of the Three Kings\"), cast in 1418, installed in 1437, and recast in 1880. Two of the other bells, the ''Pretiosa'' (10.5&nbsp;tonnes; at that time the largest bell in the [[Western world]]) and the ''Speciosa'' (5.6&nbsp;tonnes) were installed in 1448 and remain in place today.\n\nDuring the 19th century, as the building neared completion, there was a desire to extend the number of bells. This was facilitated by Kaiser Wilhelm I who gave [[French Bronze|French bronze]] cannon, captured in 1870\u201371, for this purpose. The 22 pieces of artillery were displayed outside the Cathedral on 11 May 1872. Andreas Hamm in [[Frankenthal]] used them to cast a bell of over 27,000 kilos on 19 August 1873. The tone was not harmonious and another attempt was made on 13 November 1873. The Central Cathedral Association, which had agreed to take over the costs, did not want this bell either.

The earliest may have been for grain storage and possibly was succeeded by a [[Roman temple]] built by [[Mercurius Augustus]]. From the 4th century on, however, the site was occupied by Christian buildings, including a square edifice known as the \"oldest cathedral\" that was commissioned by [[Maternus of Cologne|Maternus]], the first bishop of Cologne. A free-standing [[baptistery]] dating back to the 7th century was located at the east end of the present cathedral but was demolished in the 9th century to build the second cathedral. During excavations of the present cathedral, graves were discovered in the location of the oldest portion of the building; including that of a boy that was richly adorned with [[grave goods]] and another of a woman, popularly thought to be [[Wisigard]]. Both graves are thought to be from the 6th century. Only ruins of the baptistery and the octagonal [[baptismal font]] remain today.{{Citation needed|reason=No source given to back new addition re graves|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe second church, called the \"Old Cathedral\", was completed in 818. It was destroyed by fire on 30 April 1248, during demolition work to prepare for a new cathedral.\n\n=== Medieval beginning ===\n\nIn 1164, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Rainald of Dassel]], acquired the relics of the [[Three Kings]] which the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], had taken from the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]], Milan, Italy. (Parts of the relics have since been returned to Milan.) The relics have great religious significance and drew pilgrims from all over [[Christendom]]. It was important to church officials that they be properly housed, and thus began a building program in the new style of [[Gothic architecture]], based in particular on the French cathedral of [[Amiens Cathedral|Amiens]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe [[foundation stone]] was laid on 15 August 1248, by Archbishop [[Konrad von Hochstaden]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cologne.de/what-to-do/the-cologne-cathedral.html |title=The Cologne Cathedral |publisher=Cologne.de |accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> The eastern arm was completed under the direction of [[Master Gerhard]], was consecrated in 1322 and sealed off by a temporary wall so it could be used as the work continued.

The plan is in the shape of a [[Latin Cross]], as is usual with Gothic cathedrals. It has two aisles on either side, which help to support one of the very highest Gothic vaults in the world, being nearly as tall as that of the [[Beauvais Cathedral]], much of which collapsed. Externally the outward thrust of the vault is taken by [[flying buttress]]es in the French manner. The eastern end has a single ambulatory, the second aisle resolving into a ''[[chevet]]'' of seven radiating chapels.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nInternally, the medieval choir is more varied and less mechanical in its details than the 19th-century building. It presents a French style arrangement of very tall [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]], a delicate narrow [[triforium]] gallery lit by windows and with detailed tracery merging with that of the windows above. The [[clerestory]] windows are tall and retain some old figurative glass in the lower sections. The whole is united by the tall shafts that sweep unbroken from the floor to their capitals at the spring of the vault. The vault is of plain quadripartite arrangement.\n\nThe choir retains a great many of its original fittings, including the carved stalls, which is made the more surprising by the fact that French Revolutionary troops had desecrated the building. A large stone statue of [[St Christopher]] looks down towards the place where the earlier entrance to the cathedral was, before its completion in the late 19th century.\n\nThe nave has many 19th century stained glass windows. A set of five on the south side, called the ''Bayernfenster'', were a gift from [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]], and strongly represent the painterly German style of that date.\n\nExternally, particularly from a distance, the building is dominated by its huge spires, which are entirely Germanic in character, being openwork like those of [[Ulm Minster|Ulm]], [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Vienna]], [[Strasbourg cathedral|Strasbourg]] and [[Regensburg Cathedral]]s.<ref>Wim Swaan,{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Banister Fletcher{{page needed|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\" widths=\"270px\">\nFile:Cologne cathedral aerial (25326253726).jpg|A \"Bird's eye view\" shows the cruciform plan\nFile:Cologne cathedrale vue sud.jpg|The cathedral from the south\nFile:Koelner-dom-spire.jpg|The exterior of one of the spires\nFile:Cathedral main entrance.jpg|The main entrance shows the 19th century decoration\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"250px\" widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg|The flying buttresses and pinnacles of the Medieval east end\nFile:Koelner Dom Innenraum.jpg|The [[nave]] looking east\nFile:Cologne Cathedral interior.JPG|Interior of the Medieval east end, showing the extreme height\nFile:Koelner dom neue orgel.jpg|This \"swallows' nest\" organ was built into the gallery in 1998, to celebrate the cathedral's 750 years\n</gallery>\n\n== Dimensions ==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =\n | image1    = Jahrbuch MZK Band 03 - Gew\u00f6lbesystem - Fig 75 Chordurchschnitt des Domes zu C\u00f6ln - S\u00fcdseite.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = 19th century cross-section, south elevation of the choir\n | image2    = Plan.cathedrale.Cologne.png\n | width2    = 255\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = Groundplan\n }}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"width:12em\"|External length||align=\"right\"| {{convert|144.58|m|ft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|External width||align=\"right\"| {{convert|86.25|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Width of west fa\u00e7ade||align=\"right\"| {{convert|61.54|m|ft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Width of [[transept]] fa\u00e7ade||align=\"right\"| {{convert|39.95|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Width of [[nave]] (with aisles, interior)||align=\"right\"| {{convert|45.19|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of southern tower||align=\"right\"| {{convert|157.31|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of northern tower||align=\"right\"| {{convert|157.38|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of ridge turret||align=\"right\"| {{convert|109.00|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of transept fa\u00e7ades||align=\"right\"| {{convert|69.95|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of roof ridge||align=\"right\"| {{convert|61.10|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Inner height of nave||align=\"right\"| {{convert|43.35|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Building area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|7914|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Window surface area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|10000|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Roof surface area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|12000|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Gross volume without buttresses||align=\"right\"| {{convert|407000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|}\n\n== Treasures{{anchor | Treasures of Cologne Cathedral}} ==\nOne of the treasures of the cathedral is the High Altar, which was installed in 1322. It is constructed of black marble, with a solid slab {{convert|15|ft|m}} long forming the top. The front and sides are overlaid with white marble niches into which are set figures, with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] at the centre.<ref>Holladay, Joan. ''Iconography of the High Altar in Cologne Cathedral'', (1989){{full citation needed|date=February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe most celebrated work of art in the cathedral is the ''[[Shrine of the Three Kings]]'', commissioned by Philip von Heinsberg, archbishop of Cologne from 1167 to 1191 and created by Nicholas of Verdun, begun in 1190. It is traditionally believed to hold the remains of the [[Three Wise Men]], whose relics were acquired by [[Frederick Barbarossa]] at the conquest of Milan in 1164.   The shrine takes the form a large [[reliquary]] in the shape of a basilican church, made of bronze and silver, gilded and ornamented with architectonic details, figurative sculpture, enamels and gemstones.  The shrine was opened in 1864 and was found to contain bones and garments.\n\nNear the [[sacristy]] is the ''[[Gero Crucifix|Gero-Kreuz]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistory.upenn.edu/smr04/101910/Slide11.18.jpg|title=Art History|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]}}</ref> a large crucifix carved in oak and with traces of paint and gilding.

The altar of the patron saints of Cologne with an altarpiece by the [[International Gothic]] painter [[Stefan Lochner]] is in the ''Marienkapelle'' (\"St. Mary's Chapel\"). Other works of art are in the Cathedral Treasury. The altar also houses the relics of [[Saint Irmgardis]].\n\nEmbedded in the interior wall are a pair of [[Stele|stone tablets]] on which are carved the provisions formulated by Archbishop Englebert II (1262\u201367) under which Jews were permitted to reside in Cologne.<ref>[[Salo Wittmayer Baron|Baron, Salo Wittmayer]].

Cathedral organists have included [[Josef Zimmermann]], [[Clemens Ganz]] (1985\u20132001) and [[Winfried B\u00f6nig]] (2001).\n\n=== Bells ===\n[[File:CologneCathedralBell02.jpg|thumb|[[St. Petersglocke|''Petersglocke'']]; a person stands to the right of bell clapper]]\n\nThe cathedral has eleven church bells, four of which are medieval. The first was the 3.8-tonne ''Dreik\u00f6nigsglocke'' (\"Bell of the Three Kings\"), cast in 1418, installed in 1437, and recast in 1880. Two of the other bells, the ''Pretiosa'' (10.5&nbsp;tonnes; at that time the largest bell in the [[Western world]]) and the ''Speciosa'' (5.6&nbsp;tonnes) were installed in 1448 and remain in place today.\n\nDuring the 19th century, as the building neared completion, there was a desire to extend the number of bells. This was facilitated by Kaiser Wilhelm I who gave [[French Bronze|French bronze]] cannon, captured in 1870\u201371, for this purpose. The 22 pieces of artillery were displayed outside the Cathedral on 11 May 1872. Andreas Hamm in [[Frankenthal]] used them to cast a bell of over 27,000 kilos on 19 August 1873. The tone was not harmonious and another attempt was made on 13 November 1873. The Central Cathedral Association, which had agreed to take over the costs, did not want this bell either. Another attempt took place on 3 October 1874. The colossal bell was shipped to Cologne and on 13 May 1875, installed in the Cathedral. This ''Kaiserglocke'' was eventually melted in 1918 to support the German war effort. The Kaiserglocke was the largest free-swinging bell in history.\n\nThe 24-tonne ''[[St. Petersglocke]]'' (\"Bell of St. Peter\", \"''{{lang|ksh|Decke Pitter}}''\" in the [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch language]] or in common parlance known as \"''Dicker Pitter''\"), was cast in 1922 and was the largest free-swinging bell in the world, until a new bell was cast in Innsbruck for the People's Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest in Romania.<ref>The [[World Peace Bell]] in [[Newport, Kentucky]] is larger, but turns around its [[center of mass]] rather than its top.</ref>\n\n==== Bells of the ridge turret ====\n* Mettglocke \u2013 280 kilograms\n* Wandlungsglocke \u2013 425 kilograms\n* Angelusglocke \u2013 763 kilograms\n\n==== Bells of the main bell cage in the south spire ====\n* Aveglocke \u2013 830 kilograms\n* Kapitelsglocke \u2013 1.4 tonnes\n* Josephglocke \u2013 2.2 tonnes\n* Ursulaglocke \u2013 2.5 tonnes\n* Dreik\u00f6nigsglocke \u2013 3.8 tonnes\n* Speciosa \u2013 5.6 tonnes\n* Pretiosa \u2013 10.5 tonnes\n* St. Petersglocke, Great Bell of Germany \u2013 24 tonnes\n\n== See also == \n[[File:Kolnerdom-december2015.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=1|(video) Cologne Cathedral in 2014]]\n* [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches]]\n* [[Gero Cross]]\n* [[Gothic architecture]]\n* [[Gothic Revival architecture]]\n* [[List of buildings and structures]]\n* [[List of highest church naves]]\n*[[List of cathedrals in Germany]]\n* [[Medievalism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Swaan, Wim and Christopher Brooke, ''The Gothic Cathedral'', Omega Books (1969), {{ISBN|0-907853-48-X}}\n* Fletcher, Banister, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''.\n* Hubbard, Howard, ''Masterpieces of Western Sculpture'', Thames and Hudson, {{ISBN|0-500-23278-4}}\n* Wolff, Arnold, ''Cologne Cathedral.
