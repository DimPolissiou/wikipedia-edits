The following year, the MHRA created a \"best in show\" award for Autorama, named after the man who made the biggest impact in the show's first eleven years, and thus the Ridler Award was born.\n\nThe 9th Annual Detroit Autorama was the first to be held at the new [[TCF Center|Cobo Hall]]. That year featured a new-record 230 cars competing, and filled all {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of Cobo's lower-level basement. The 1961 show's last day also broke the event attendance record by drawing a crowd of approximately 35,000 people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=45\u201346}}</ref> During these early years at Cobo, the event began to attract industry names from outside the Motor City, including George Barris, [[Darryl Starbird]], Carl Casper, and [[Ed Roth|\"Big Daddy\" Ed Roth]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=44}}</ref> And as part of [[Ford Motor Company]]'s \"Ford Custom Car Caravan\", the show also generated attention from other big name [[Custom car|customizer]]s, including [[Bill Cushenberry]], Jack Florence, [[Dean Jeffries]], and [[Gene Winfield]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=48}}</ref>\n\nThough the show was by then in its twelfth year, it was in 1964 the Don Ridler Memorial Award was introduced as the event's top prize. The inaugural Don Ridler Award went to [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb]]'s Al Bergler, with a Competition{{citation needed|date=December 2018|reason=not a Gas or Alky car?}} [[slingshot dragster|slingshot]] [[dragster (car)|dragster]]. (Bergler went on to be known in the [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) as driver of the ''[[Motown Shaker]]'' [[Top Fuel]] [[Funny Car]]).\n\nFollowing Bergler's win in 1964, the next ten years saw both a growth in the number of exhibitors,{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} as well as the number of professional custom car builders competing for the show's new top prize. From 1965 to 1973, all nine Ridler-winning entries were either owned, or built, by [[The Alexander Brothers|Larry and Mike Alexander]], Jerry Pennington, or George Busti-all of whom were professional builders.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=148\u2013151|chapter=Six}}</ref>\n\nThe 1970s brought on unique cars to wn the Ridler.{{According to whom|date=May 2016}} Jerry Pennington's{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=owner or builder?}} rear-engine Corvette ([[Scorpion (custom car)|''Scorpion'']]) and hand-built custom street rod ([[Devilfish (custom car)|''Devilfish'']]) featured many of the era's trends, including shag carpeting, velvet seating, and sharp edges.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} 1974's event was a first for Autorama, as [[Wimauma, Florida]]'s Don Campbell and his '27 Ford became the first out-of-state entry to capture the Ridler Award.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=152}}</ref> The decade was then capped-off with a series of six Ford [[T-bucket]] Ridler winners, including three '23s ('76, '78, '79), two '27s ('74 & '75), and one '26 ('77).<ref name=\":6\" /> The Ford roadster trend continued throughout the 1980s as well, with two '34s ('81 & '82), a '28 ('80), a '29 ('83), a '33 ('85) and a '35 ('84). The first non-roadster to win the Ridler since 1973 was Dale Hunt's late-model [[Pro Stock]] Pontiac Grand Am at the 34th annual Detroit Autorama in 1986. Hunt's Grand Am remains one of only two Pro Stock cars to have won the Ridler (the other being Bob Rizzoli's '92 Mercedes 560 SEC).\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 90s, the Autorama continued to grow into one of the most prestigious car shows in the country.{{According to whom|date=May 2016}} To assist in growing, the next generation of professional builders and renowned car owners began to make their way to Cobo every winter in hopes of capturing the much-desired Ridler Award. Among them were California's Bobby Alloway and [[Boyd Coddington]], Memphis' [[George Poteet]], along with many others. The only downside to this growing national attention was Michigan's dwindling presence. As exhibitors started traveling from across the country to fight for the show's top prize, many local Detroit and Michigan entries became less competitive against cars from other states, most of whom were being built with much larger budgets. Though the Alexander Brothers continued to build local cars for the show (including a Great-8 competitor in 2012), to date,{{When|date=May 2016}} [[Rochester Hills, Michigan|Rochester Hills]]'s Dave Emery's '32 Ford Roadster ([[Revolver (custom car)|'' Revolver'']]) was in 1997 the last Michigan-built entries to win the Ridler Award.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=161}}</ref>\n\nThe new millennium brought forth a new form of styling and look to the Ridler and Great 8 cars. It also brought with it yet another generation of professional car builders. Wes Rydell's '35 Chevy [[Grand Master (custom car)|''Grand Master'']] became designer [[Chip Foose]]'s first build to win the award in 2002. Foose returned again the following year with a '34 Ford, [[The Stallion (custom car)|''Stallion'']], for Arizona's Ron Whiteside, which made him only the third builder in the show's history, and the first since Jerry Pennington, to win the award two consecutive years in-a-row.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=164}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2004-Detroit-Autorama-JTTWebServices.jpg|thumb|Example of the turnout for the 52nd Annual Autorama.]]\n\nFoose returned again in 2005 with a '36 Ford ([[Impression (custom car)|''Impression'']]), built for [[Littleton, Colorado]]'s Ken Reister. It was with ''Impression'' Foose set a record, becoming the first builder to ever win three Ridler Awards, having won them all in a four-year span. Foose would snap his own record yet again ten years later, when his '65 Chevy Impala ([[Imposter (custom car)|''Imposter'']], built for Don and Elma Voth) captured his fourth Ridler in 2015.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Ridler cars transitioned from individual-builds to group-builds. Ross and Beth Myer's '36 Ford ([[First Love (custom car)|''First Love'']]) was the first Ridler-winning car to be built by a custom car shop in the modern era (they hired \"Rad Rides By Troy\" owner/operator [[Troy Trepanier]]). The transition continued with 2010 winner Tammy Ray and her '34 Ford Phaeton, ''Gold Digger'', built by T & T Customs' owner/operator Ted Thompson, 2012 winner Dwayne Peace and his '55 T-bird, built by Torq'd Design Lab & Greening Auto Company, and 2013 winner Rob & Deb Cizek and their 1940 Ford Coupe [[Checkered Past (custom car)|''Checkered Past'']], built by [[Cal Customs]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=GP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=167\u2013169}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years,{{When|date=May 2016}} the roadster trend has begun to fade. Since 2008, only four roadsters or pre-1940 cars have won the Ridler (Ray's ''Gold Digger'', the Cizeks' ''Checkered Past'', Doug Cooper's{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=owner or builder?}} '32 Ford [[Duecenberg (custom car)|''Duecenberg'']], and Billy Thomas'{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=owner or builder?}} |[[Olds Cool (custom car)|''Olds Cool'']]). Also, another streak dating back to Dave Emery's 1997 winner was snapped in 2014, when [[Osoyoos, British Columbia]]'s J.F Launier and his '64 Buick Riviera won the Ridler as a single owner/builder entry.\n\n[[File:Chip-Foose-Friday-At-Cobo-2015-JTTWebServices.jpg|left|thumb|Designer/Builder Chip Foose stands by his 2015 Ridler Winning '65 Impala ''Imposter'' during the first night of the 63rd Annual Detroit Autorama.]]\n\nIn 2002, the Detroit Autorama celebrated its 50th anniversary with special promotions from Murray's Auto Parts, and inducted an honorary list of \"50 People Who Made a Difference\" during that year's \"Ridler Ball\". A hall of fame, entitled \"The Autorama: Circle of Champions\", was also introduced in 1997, and has inducted at least one member every year<!...--> since. Inductees include [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] (1999), [[Ed Roth]] (2000), [[Crain Communications]]' Keith Crain (2003), [[Street Rodder Magazine|''Street Rodder'']]'s Brian Brennan (2010), [[Chip Foose]] (2013), and [[Hurst Performance|Hurst Shifter]] girl [[Linda Vaughn]] (2014).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=GP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=279}}</ref> Autorama also introduced for their 50th anniversary a special \"Builder/Owner of the Year\" award-presented every year to a past Ridler-winning or major show contributor. The winner is honored at the annual Ridler Ball in Cobo's ball room, and is featured in a special exhibit within the show which showcases the owner/builder's previous work.

That year featured a new-record 230 cars competing, and filled all {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of Cobo's lower-level basement. The 1961 show's last day also broke the event attendance record by drawing a crowd of approximately 35,000 people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=45\u201346}}</ref> During these early years at Cobo, the event began to attract industry names from outside the Motor City, including George Barris, [[Darryl Starbird]], Carl Casper, and [[Ed Roth|\"Big Daddy\" Ed Roth]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=44}}</ref> And as part of [[Ford Motor Company]]'s \"Ford Custom Car Caravan\", the show also generated attention from other big name [[Custom car|customizer]]s, including [[Bill Cushenberry]], Jack Florence, [[Dean Jeffries]], and [[Gene Winfield]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=48}}</ref>\n\nThough the show was by then in its twelfth year, it was in 1964 the Don Ridler Memorial Award was introduced as the event's top prize. The inaugural Don Ridler Award went to [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb]]'s Al Bergler, with a Competition{{cn|date=December 2018|reason=not a Gas or Alky car?}} [[slingshot dragster|slingshot]] [[dragster (car)|dragster]]. (Bergler went on to be known in the [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) as driver of the ''[[Motown Shaker]]'' [[Top Fuel]] [[Funny Car]]).\n\nFollowing Bergler's win in 1964, the next ten years saw both a growth in the number of exhibitors,{{cn|date=December 2018}} as well as the number of professional custom car builders competing for the show's new top prize. From 1965 to 1973, all nine Ridler-winning entries were either owned, or built, by [[The Alexander Brothers|Larry and Mike Alexander]], Jerry Pennington, or George Busti-all of whom were professional builders.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=148\u2013151|chapter=Six}}</ref>\n\nThe 1970s brought on unique cars to wn the Ridler.{{According to whom|date=May 2016}} Jerry Pennington's{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=owner or builder?}} rear-engine Corvette ([[Scorpion (custom car)|''Scorpion'']]) and hand-built custom street rod ([[Devilfish (custom car)|''Devilfish'']]) featured many of the era's trends, including shag carpeting, velvet seating, and sharp edges.{{cn|date=December 2018}} 1974's event was a first for Autorama, as [[Wimauma, Florida]]'s Don Campbell and his '27 Ford became the first out-of-state entry to capture the Ridler Award.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=152}}</ref> The decade was then capped-off with a series of six Ford [[T-bucket]] Ridler winners, including three '23s ('76, '78, '79), two '27s ('74 & '75), and one '26 ('77).<ref name=\":6\" /> The Ford roadster trend continued throughout the 1980s as well, with two '34s ('81 & '82), a '28 ('80), a '29 ('83), a '33 ('85) and a '35 ('84). The first non-roadster to win the Ridler since 1973 was Dale Hunt's late-model [[Pro Stock]] Pontiac Grand Am at the 34th annual Detroit Autorama in 1986. Hunt's Grand Am remains one of only two Pro Stock cars to have won the Ridler (the other being Bob Rizzoli's '92 Mercedes 560 SEC).\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 90s, the Autorama continued to grow into one of the most prestigious car shows in the country.{{According to whom|date=May 2016}} To assist in growing, the next generation of professional builders and renowned car owners began to make their way to Cobo every winter in hopes of capturing the much-desired Ridler Award. Among them were California's Bobby Alloway and [[Boyd Coddington]], Memphis' [[George Poteet]], along with many others. The only downside to this growing national attention was Michigan's dwindling presence. As exhibitors started traveling from across the country to fight for the show's top prize, many local Detroit and Michigan entries became less competitive against cars from other states, most of whom were being built with much larger budgets. Though the Alexander Brothers continued to build local cars for the show (including a Great-8 competitor in 2012), to date,{{When|date=May 2016}} [[Rochester Hills, Michigan|Rochester Hills]]'s Dave Emery's '32 Ford Roadster ([[Revolver (custom car)|'' Revolver'']]) was in 1997 the last Michigan-built entries to win the Ridler Award.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=161}}</ref>\n\nThe new millennium brought forth a new form of styling and look to the Ridler and Great 8 cars. It also brought with it yet another generation of professional car builders. Wes Rydell's '35 Chevy [[Grand Master (custom car)|''Grand Master'']] became designer [[Chip Foose]]'s first build to win the award in 2002. Foose returned again the following year with a '34 Ford, [[The Stallion (custom car)|''Stallion'']], for Arizona's Ron Whiteside, which made him only the third builder in the show's history, and the first since Jerry Pennington, to win the award two consecutive years in-a-row.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=DP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=164}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2004-Detroit-Autorama-JTTWebServices.jpg|thumb|Example of the turnout for the 52nd Annual Autorama.]]\n\nFoose returned again in 2005 with a '36 Ford ([[Impression (custom car)|''Impression'']]), built for [[Littleton, Colorado]]'s Ken Reister. It was with ''Impression'' Foose set a record, becoming the first builder to ever win three Ridler Awards, having won them all in a four-year span. Foose would snap his own record yet again ten years later, when his '65 Chevy Impala ([[Imposter (custom car)|''Imposter'']], built for Don and Elma Voth) captured his fourth Ridler in 2015.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Ridler cars transitioned from individual-builds to group-builds. Ross and Beth Myer's '36 Ford ([[First Love (custom car)|''First Love'']]) was the first Ridler-winning car to be built by a custom car shop in the modern era (they hired \"Rad Rides By Troy\" owner/operator [[Troy Trepanier]]). The transition continued with 2010 winner Tammy Ray and her '34 Ford Phaeton, ''Gold Digger'', built by T & T Customs' owner/operator Ted Thompson, 2012 winner Dwayne Peace and his '55 T-bird, built by Torq'd Design Lab & Greening Auto Company, and 2013 winner Rob & Deb Cizek and their 1940 Ford Coupe [[Checkered Past (custom car)|''Checkered Past'']], built by [[Cal Customs]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=GP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=167\u2013169}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years,{{When|date=May 2016}} the roadster trend has begun to fade. Since 2008, only four roadsters or pre-1940 cars have won the Ridler (Ray's ''Gold Digger'', the Cizeks' ''Checkered Past'', Doug Cooper's{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=owner or builder?}} '32 Ford [[Duecenberg (custom car)|''Duecenberg'']], and Billy Thomas'{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=owner or builder?}} |[[Olds Cool (custom car)|''Olds Cool'']]). Also, another streak dating back to Dave Emery's 1997 winner was snapped in 2014, when [[Osoyoos, British Columbia]]'s J.F Launier and his '64 Buick Riviera won the Ridler as a single owner/builder entry.\n\n[[File:Chip-Foose-Friday-At-Cobo-2015-JTTWebServices.jpg|left|thumb|Designer/Builder Chip Foose stands by his 2015 Ridler Winning '65 Impala ''Imposter'' during the first night of the 63rd Annual Detroit Autorama.]]\n\nIn 2002, the Detroit Autorama celebrated its 50th anniversary with special promotions from Murray's Auto Parts, and inducted an honorary list of \"50 People Who Made a Difference\" during that year's \"Ridler Ball\". A hall of fame, entitled \"The Autorama: Circle of Champions\", was also introduced in 1997, and has inducted at least one member every year<!...--> since. Inductees include [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] (1999), [[Ed Roth]] (2000), [[Crain Communications]]' Keith Crain (2003), [[Street Rodder Magazine|''Street Rodder'']]'s Brian Brennan (2010), [[Chip Foose]] (2013), and [[Hurst Performance|Hurst Shifter]] girl [[Linda Vaughn]] (2014).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=GP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=279}}</ref> Autorama also introduced for their 50th anniversary a special \"Builder/Owner of the Year\" award-presented every year to a past Ridler-winning or major show contributor. The winner is honored at the annual Ridler Ball in Cobo's ball room, and is featured in a special exhibit within the show which showcases the owner/builder's previous work. Past \"Builders of the Year\" include the Alexander Brothers (2002), [[Blackie Gejeian]] (2004), Ed Roth (2006), [[So-Cal Speed Shop]] (2007), [[Gene Winfield]] (2008), [[Darryl Starbird]] (2009), Bobby Alloway (2011), and Troy Trepanier (2014).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hot Rod Detroit|last=Larivee|first=Bob|publisher=GP Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-0-692-30899-8|location=Oxford, Michigan|pages=281}}</ref>\n\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Ridler Award in 2013, the 61st annual Detroit Autorama \"Builder of the Year\" exhibit was replaced with the largest gathering of former Ridler-winning cars ever assembled. Some of the cars included in the exhibition were Al Bergler's [[Aggravation (custom car)|''Aggravation'']], the [[Alexander Brothers]]'{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=owner or builder?}} ''[[Venturian]]'', Pennington's [[Devilfish (custom car)|''Devilfish'']], Bob Rizzoli's{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=owner or builder?}} '92 Mercedes, Rydell's{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=owner or builder?}} [[Grandmaster (custom car)|''Grandmaster'']], Reister's ''Impression'', Ray's [[Gold Digger (custom car)|''Gold Digger'']], Bruce Rick's{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=owner or builder?}} |[[Suncammer (custom car)|''Suncammer'']], and Peace's{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=owner or builder?}} [[Fprd Thunderbird (first generation)|'55 Thunderbird]]. In addition to the gathering of former Ridler-cars, the exhibit included a special Saturday-autograph session, which brought out names like Bergler, Alloway, and Foode-to sign commorative \"50th Anniversary Artwork\" with each of their cars on it. To cap-off the celebration, the winners of the 50th Ridler Award (Rob & Deb Cizek & their 1940 Ford \"Checkered Past\") were presented with a one-of-a-kind Gold Ridler trophy unlike any given-before or after.\n[[File:Judging-staff-2016-Autorama-JTTWebServices.jpg|left|thumb|ISCA judges run through every car in the show to decide the overall winners in each of the over 500 classes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Illustrated History of the Roseville High School Auto Shop.|last=Tregembo|first=Joseph|publisher=Blurb|year=2015|isbn=978-1-364-44493-8|location=Seattle, Washington|pages=35}}</ref> In addition to the staff on-hand to judge all the individual classes, a specific staff of judges is also brought-in specifically to judge the Ridler Contenders, and decide both the Pirelli Great 8 and Ridler Award winner.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Illustrated History of the Roseville High School Auto Shop|last=Tregembo|first=Joseph|publisher=Blurb|year=2015|isbn=978-1-364-44493-8|location=Seattle, Washington|pages=109}}</ref>]]\n[[File:ISCA-Outstanding-Full-Handbuilt-Custom-2010-JTTWebServices.jpg|thumb|A 2010 ISCA Outstanding Award for \"Full/Radical Hardtop or Custom\".

In 1963, CASI President Bob Larivee Sr. helped the MHRA form a new governing body for show car events, titled the International Show Car Association (ISCA). The ISCA has since become the leading promoter and governing body of show car events and competitions in the country. Along with CASI (now \"North America's largest producer of indoor hot rod shows\"<ref name=\":8\" />) they co-promote and judge events from coast-to-coast, ranging from the Boston World of Wheels to the Grand National Roadster Show in [[Pomona, California]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theisca.com/?page_id=2141|title=Schedule-The International Show Car Association|last=|first=|date=2016-03-27|website=TheISCA.Com|publisher=ISCA|access-date=2016-03-27}}</ref> All ISCA events have a series of \"Outstanding Awards\" for more than three-dozen classes.

In the early 1960s, a study was commissioned by the Secretary of Defense to examine the entire DoD contracting process. Known as \"Project 60,\" the findings pointed to numerous benefits of consolidating contract administration and audit. At that time, each defense agency and military service was administering and auditing its own contracts, which resulted in a great amount of duplicate effort. Many of the contract administration responsibilities were eventually moved to the [[Defense Logistics Agency]] (DLA). However, the military services continued to retain oversight of the major weapon systems acquisition programs.\n\n==Defense Contract Management Command (DCMC)==\nThe contract administration process was again reviewed in 1989.  Citing continued problems with the manner in which the services were administering contracts, a Defense Management Review Decision (DMRD) 916 recommended the establishment of a joint command to administer defense contracts, to ensure that consistent policies and standards were applied to the defense acquisition process.  DCMC was established as a command within the [[Defense Logistics Agency]] in February 1990 to satisfy the findings of DMRD 916.\n\n==DCMC became DCMA==\nOn March 27, 2000, DCMC was renamed as the Defense Contract Management Agency and established independently from DLA.
