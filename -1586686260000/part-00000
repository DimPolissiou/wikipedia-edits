In 1853 he removed to Chicago, served for three years as bookkeeper, and in 1858 entered the Merchants Loan and Trust Company, where he was cashier in 1861-1868. Afterwards be became successively assistant cashier, vice-president, and president of the [[First Chicago Bank|First National Bank of Chicago]], one of the strongest financial institutions in the [[Midwestern United States|Middle West]].\n\nHe was chosen in 1890 to be president of the board of directors of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. Following the exposition, he became president of the newly formed [[Chicago Civic Federation]], which sought to reform city governance.\n\n===Political career===\nIn politics he was originally a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]], and was a delegate to the national convention of the party in 1880, and chairman of its finance committee.\n\nIn 1884, however, he supported [[Grover Cleveland]] for the [[President of the United States|presidency]], and came to be looked upon as a Democrat. In 1892 President Cleveland, after his second election, offered Gage the post of secretary of the treasury, but Gage declined the offer. In the [[free silver|free-silver]] campaign of 1896, Gage labored effectively for the election of Republican candidate [[William McKinley]], and from March 1897 until January 1902 he served as [[Secretary of the Treasury]] in the cabinets successively of Presidents McKinley and [[Theodore Roosevelt]].\n\n[[File:GAGE, Lyman J-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Gage as Secretary of the Treasury.]]\n\nAs Secretary of the Treasury, Gage was influential in securing passage of the [[Gold Standard Act]] of March 14, 1900, which reestablished a currency backed solely by gold. Since this limited the amount of [[currency]] in circulation, it initiated a period, continuing until 1912, in which the Secretary of Treasury was obliged to interact in the money market by introducing into circulation the Treasury surplus. The inability of the Treasury to respond to the needs of the market as well as the perceived need for a currency which would expand and contract with the needs of the nation, led to the creation of the [[Federal Reserve]] in 1913 to regulate the [[money market]].\n\nGage resigned in 1902 to become a banker in New York. From April 1902 until 1906 he was president of the [[United States Trust Company]] in [[New York City]]. His administration of the treasury department, through a more than ordinarily trying period, was marked by a conservative policy, looking toward the strengthening of the gold standard, the securing of greater flexibility in the currency, and a more perfect adjustment of the relations between the government and the National banks.\n\nLyman J Gage was instrumental in creating the San Diego [[Panama\u2013California Exposition]] of 1915. Later he was president of the committee to preserve the Expo's characteristic buildings in Balboa Park.\n\n===Final years===\nGage was one of the 30 founding members of the [[Simplified Spelling Board]], founded in 1906 by [[Andrew Carnegie]] to make English easier to learn and understand through changes in the [[orthography]] of the [[English language]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F02E5D6103EE733A25751C1A9659C946797D6CF&scp=1 \"CARNEGIE ASSAULTS THE SPELLING BOOK; To Pay the Cost of Reforming English Orthography.

Accessed August 28, 2008.</ref>\n\nHe died in [[San Diego]], [[California]], in 1927 and is buried at [[Rosehill Cemetery, Chicago|Rosehill Cemetery]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].\n\n==Private life==\n[[File:Mrs Lyman J. Gage.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs. Cornelia Gage]]\nLyman Gage married Sarah Etheridge in 1864, and the couple had four children: Locke, Eli Alexander, Fanny, and Mary; only Eli survived to adulthood. Sarah died in 1874, when son Eli was 7 years old.  Eli Gage married Sophie R Weare in 1893 in Iowa, but committed suicide in Seattle in 1906 leaving his wife and two young sons, Lyman J. Gage II (1896-1954) and John Weare Gage (1900-1962).  After Sarah's death, Lyman Gage married Cornelia Lansing, who died childless in 1901. In late 1910s, Gage remarried a third time with Frances Ballou, and the two had a son, Lyman Judson. Frances died in 1943, around 16 years after Gage's death.\n\nIn 1906, Gage indulged his longtime interest in [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] phenomena by purchasing property on and subsequently living at [[Lomaland]], a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]] retreat in Southern California. Though this came as something of a shock to the American public, those who knew him privately were not surprised, as Gage had previously studied [[spiritualism]], [[astrology]], and prophesied the death of his own brother through a \"[[psychic]] flash\".<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/lccn/sn84026749/1906-07-15/ed-1/seq-48 Chronicling America - The Library of Congress<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.loc.gov</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{wikisource author}}\n*{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Gage, Lyman Judson}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{U.S. Cabinet official box\n| before= [[John Griffin Carlisle|John G.

In the [[free silver|free-silver]] campaign of 1896, Gage labored effectively for the election of Republican candidate [[William McKinley]], and from March 1897 until January 1902 he served as [[Secretary of the Treasury]] in the cabinets successively of Presidents McKinley and [[Theodore Roosevelt]].\n\n[[File:GAGE, Lyman J-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Gage as Secretary of the Treasury.]]\n\nAs Secretary of the Treasury, Gage was influential in securing passage of the [[Gold Standard Act]] of March 14, 1900, which reestablished a currency backed solely by gold. Since this limited the amount of [[currency]] in circulation, it initiated a period, continuing until 1912, in which the Secretary of Treasury was obliged to interact in the money market by introducing into circulation the Treasury surplus. The inability of the Treasury to respond to the needs of the market as well as the perceived need for a currency which would expand and contract with the needs of the nation, led to the creation of the [[Federal Reserve]] in 1913 to regulate the [[money market]].\n\nGage resigned in 1902 to become a banker in New York. From April 1902 until 1906 he was president of the [[United States Trust Company]] in [[New York City]]. His administration of the treasury department, through a more than ordinarily trying period, was marked by a conservative policy, looking toward the strengthening of the gold standard, the securing of greater flexibility in the currency, and a more perfect adjustment of the relations between the government and the National banks.\n\nLyman J Gage was instrumental in creating the San Diego [[Panama\u2013California Exposition]] of 1915. Later he was president of the committee to preserve the Expo's characteristic buildings in Balboa Park.\n\n===Final years===\nGage was one of the 30 founding members of the [[Simplified Spelling Board]], founded in 1906 by [[Andrew Carnegie]] to make English easier to learn and understand through changes in the [[orthography]] of the [[English language]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F02E5D6103EE733A25751C1A9659C946797D6CF&scp=1 \"CARNEGIE ASSAULTS THE SPELLING BOOK; To Pay the Cost of Reforming English Orthography. CAMPAIGN ABOUT TO BEGIN Board Named, with Headquarters Here -- Local Societies Throughout the Country.\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 12, 1906. Accessed August 28, 2008.</ref>\n\nHe died in [[San Diego]], [[California]], in 1927 and is buried at [[Rosehill Cemetery, Chicago|Rosehill Cemetery]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].\n\n==Private life==\n[[File:Mrs Lyman J. Gage.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs. Cornelia Gage]]\nLyman Gage married Sarah Etheridge in 1864, and the couple had four children: Locke, Eli Alexander, Fanny, and Mary; only Eli survived to adulthood. Sarah died in 1874, when son Eli was 7 years old.  Eli Gage married Sophie R Weare in 1893 in Iowa, but committed suicide in Seattle in 1906 leaving his wife and two young sons, Lyman J. Gage II (1896-1954) and John Weare Gage (1900-1962).  After Sarah's death, Lyman Gage married Cornelia Lansing, who died childless in 1901. In late 1910s, Gage remarried a third time with Frances Ballou, and the two had a son, Lyman Judson. Frances died in 1943, around 16 years after Gage's death.\n\nIn 1906, Gage indulged his longtime interest in [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] phenomena by purchasing property on and subsequently living at [[Lomaland]], a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]] retreat in Southern California. Though this came as something of a shock to the American public, those who knew him privately were not surprised, as Gage had previously studied [[spiritualism]], [[astrology]], and prophesied the death of his own brother through a \"[[psychic]] flash\".<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/lccn/sn84026749/1906-07-15/ed-1/seq-48 Chronicling America - The Library of Congress<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.loc.gov</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{wikisource author}}\n*{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Gage, Lyman Judson}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{U.S. Cabinet official box\n| before= [[John Griffin Carlisle|John G.

Possibly because of the international reach of Japanese media and the fact that miHoYo was founded by Japanese anime fans, only Japanese voices are proposed to languages other than those 3.\n\nMoreover, ''Genshin Impact'' takes a different title in Chinese, Japanese and Korean, simply shorten to the first word of the international title i.e. ''Yu\u00e1nsh\u00e9n'' \u539f\u795e in Chinese, ''Genshin'' \u539f\u795e in Japanese and ''Wonsin'' \uc6d0\uc2e0 in Korean. The different pronouciations simply reflect the local way of pronouncing the original Chinese title, which literally means ''Primordial Gods''.\n\n== Setting ==\nIn a world called Teyvat, certain individuals chosen by the gods are given a Vision \u2014 magical gemstones that give their bearers the ability to control an element. The player starts out as a Traveler of unknown origin who is searching for a lost sibling. The player can choose between a male or female version of the Traveler. As the adventure progresses, the player controls several other characters met by the Traveler on their journey, each with unique personalities and special abilities, as they undertake quests to understand the truth about the primordial gods of this world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en|title=Genshin Impact-Step into a Vast Magical World for Adventure|website=genshin.mihoyo.com|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game features an open-world map, which the player explores by walking, climbing, swimming and gliding as necessary.

The project in question was Genshin Impact.\n\nThe game's developers have cited The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and the Grand Theft Auto series among their influences.

Possibly because of the international reach of Japanese media and the fact that miHoYo was founded by Japanese anime fans, only Japanese voices are proposed to languages other than those 3.\n\nMoreover, ''Genshin Impact'' takes a different title in Chinese, Japanese and Korean, simply shorten to the first word of the international title i.e. ''Yu\u00e1nsh\u00e9n'' \u539f\u795e in Chinese, ''Genshin'' \u539f\u795e in Japanese and ''Wonsin'' \uc6d0\uc2e0 in Korean. The different pronouciations simply reflect the local way of pronouncing the original Chinese title, which literally means ''Primordial Gods''.\n\n== Setting ==\nIn a world called Teyvat, certain individuals chosen by the gods are given a Vision \u2014 magical gemstones that give their bearers the ability to control an element. The player starts out as a Traveler of unknown origin who is searching for a lost sibling. The player can choose between a male or female version of the Traveler. As the adventure progresses, the player controls several other characters met by the Traveler on their journey, each with unique personalities and special abilities, as they undertake quests to understand the truth about the primordial gods of this world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en|title=Genshin Impact-Step into a Vast Magical World for Adventure|website=genshin.mihoyo.com|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game features an open-world map, which the player explores by walking, climbing, swimming and gliding as necessary. Many objects and places of significance are spread throughout the map.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=180824|title=\u300a\u5d29\u58de 3rd\u300b\u958b\u767c\u5546\u958b\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u5192\u96aa\u65b0\u4f5c\u300a\u539f\u795e\u300b\u66dd\u5149 \u540c\u6b65\u516c\u958b\u9996\u652f\u9810\u544a\u5f71\u7247|website=\u5df4\u54c8\u59c6\u7279\u96fb\u73a9\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7ad9|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> Players can control up to four of their characters at any one time. By completing quests to advance the story, the player is able to unlock a total of 30 playable characters.\n\nEach character has two unique combat skills: a normal and a special skill. The normal skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use, while the special skill has an energy cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient elemental energy first.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shouyou.gamersky.com/review/201906/1196056_2.shtml|title=\u300a\u539f\u795e\u300b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7248\u8bd5\u73a9\uff1a\u56fd\u4ea7\u624b\u6e38\u79bb3A\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e00\u6b21 _ \u6e38\u6c11\u661f\u7a7a\u624b\u6e38\u9891\u9053|website=shouyou.gamersky.com|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Genshinimpact/|title=Genshin Impact|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\nCooking is another significant aspect of Genshin Impact's gameplay.

The company stated its intention for the new project was to strengthen the company's R&D capabilities and produce higher-quality games. The project in question was Genshin Impact.\n\nThe game's developers have cited The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and the Grand Theft Auto series among their influences. They sought to create a game that was distinct from Honkai Impact 3rd in terms of its quest and combat systems as well as its random events and mode of exploration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/570|title=Genshin Impact-Step into a Vast Magical World for Adventure|website=genshin.mihoyo.com|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese version of the game features audio dialogue in Chinese, while the Japanese version notably features Japanese audio dialogue by many top Japanese voice artists, including Rie Tanaka.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/698|title=Genshin Impact-Step into a Vast Magical World for Adventure|website=genshin.mihoyo.com|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/1000|title=Genshin Impact-Step into a Vast Magical World for Adventure|website=genshin.mihoyo.com|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\nDuring the [[Tokyo Game Show]] in 2019, miHoYo released a promotional video for the Japanese voice acting in Genshin Impact.
