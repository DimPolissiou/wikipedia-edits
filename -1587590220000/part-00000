In 2008, [[John McCain]] defeated [[Barack Obama]] 55-42 and In 2012, [[Mitt Romney]] defeated President Obama 62\u201335. In 2016, [[Donald Trump]] won the state by a greater than 40-point margin against [[Hillary Clinton]] (68\u201326), with Clinton's performance the worst by either party in the state's history.\n\nHowever, at the statewide level, West Virginia is much friendlier to Democrats. In 2016, while President Trump won the state with nearly 70% of the vote, [[Jim Justice]] (who was a Democrat at the time, before switching his affiliation to the Republican Party) won the gubernatorial election with 49% of the vote. In 2012, which was Senator [[Joe Manchin]]\u2019s second most recent statewide election, he won with just over 60% of the vote against [[John Raese]].\n\n==Democratic primary==\n===Candidates===\n====Nominee====\n* [[Joe Manchin]], incumbent U.S. Senator<ref name=manchinrunning>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/joe-manchin-wont-run-for-wva-governor-117119.html|title=Joe Manchin won't run for West Virginia governor|work=[[Politico]]|last=Cheney|first=Kyle|date=April 19, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Eliminated in primary====\n* [[Paula Jean Swearengin]], social and environmental activist<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/09/justice_democrat_coal_miners_daughter_paula_swearingen_annoucnes_primary_against_west_virginia_sen_joe_manchin.html|title='Justice Democrat' Coal Miner's Daughter Paula Swearingen Announces Primary Challenge Against West Virginia Sen.

In 2008, [[John McCain]] defeated [[Barack Obama]] 55-42 and In 2012, [[Mitt Romney]] defeated President Obama 62\u201335. In 2016, [[Donald Trump]] won the state by a greater than 40-point margin against [[Hillary Clinton]] (68\u201326), with Clinton's performance the worst by either party in the state's history.\n\nHowever, at the statewide level, West Virginia is much friendlier to Democrats. In 2016, while President Trump won the state with nearly 70% of the vote, [[Jim Justice]] (who was a Democrat at the time, before switching his affiliation to the Republican Party) won the gubernatorial election with 49% of the vote. In 2012, which was Senator [[Joe Manchin]]\u2019s second most recent statewide election, he won with just over 60% of the vote against [[John Raese]].\n\n==Democratic primary==\n===Candidates===\n====Nominee====\n* [[Joe Manchin]], incumbent U.S. Senator<ref name=manchinrunning>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/joe-manchin-wont-run-for-wva-governor-117119.html|title=Joe Manchin won't run for West Virginia governor|work=[[Politico]]|last=Cheney|first=Kyle|date=April 19, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Eliminated in primary====\n* [[Paula Jean Swearengin]], social and environmental activist<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/09/justice_democrat_coal_miners_daughter_paula_swearingen_annoucnes_primary_against_west_virginia_sen_joe_manchin.html|title='Justice Democrat' Coal Miner's Daughter Paula Swearingen Announces Primary Challenge Against West Virginia Sen.

The municipal holiday is March 19, the day of Saint Joseph (''S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9''). The city is on [[the Portuguese Way]] variant of the [[Way of Saint James]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Santar\u00e9m May 2015-12.jpg|thumb|left|Main portal of Igreja da Gra\u00e7a]]\n[[File:Santar\u00e9m May 2015-9a.jpg|thumb|left|400px|The Tagus River as seen from Portas do Sol]]\nSince prehistory, the region of Santar\u00e9m has been inhabited, first by the [[Lusitani]] people and then by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Visigoths]], [[Moors]] and later Portuguese Christians. Of the various legends related to the foundation of Santar\u00e9m, the most famous tells of the Visigoth [[Saint Iria]] (or Irene), who was martyred in [[Tomar]] (''Nabantia'') and whose uncorrupted body reached Santar\u00e9m. In her honour, the name of the town (then known by its Latin name ''Scalabis'') would later be changed to ''Sancta Irene'', from which ''Santar\u00e9m'' would eventually be derived.\n\nThe foundation of the city is attributed to the Romans, who occupied the region in the 2nd century BC and named the city ''[[Scalabis]]''. During the Roman period Scalabis was an important commercial post in the mid-Tagus region and was the administrative capital of one of the regions (''Conventus Scalabitanus'') of [[Lusitania]]. Julius Caesar ordered the creation of a military camp in Santar\u00e9m in 61 BC. The city takes at this time the designation of ''Scallabis Praesidium Iulium''.\n\nThe 3rd century crisis and the decline of the Western Roman Empire affected the'' civitas'' and in the 5th century the town was conquered by Germanic tribes ([[Vandals]] and [[Alans]]). In 460, the Visigoths, led by Sunerico, conquered the city and expelled the Alans.<ref>http://www.santaremdigital.com/historia-santarem</ref>\n\nAfter the period of Visigoth domination, Santar\u00e9m was taken in the 8th century by the [[Moors]], who named it ''Shantarin''. Under the rule of the Moors the city became an important cultural centre. Important Moor personalities born in Santar\u00e9m include the poet and historian [[Ibn Bassam]] (died 1147) and the poet [[Ibn Sara]] (1043\u20131123).\n\nThe period of Moorish domination was finished in 1147 by the first [[King of Portugal]], [[Afonso Henriques]], who conquered the city on March 15. According to period chronicles, the King and a small army managed to take the city after some men climbed the walls during the night and opened the gates. The story of the [[conquest of Santar\u00e9m]] is told in a heroic tone in the medieval chronicle ''De expugnatione Scalabis'', which celebrates and justifies the power of the first Portuguese King. From a military point of view, the conquest of Santar\u00e9m and, in that same year, of [[Siege of Lisbon|Lisbon]] were crucial steps in the [[Reconquista]] of Portugal.\n\nThe most notable Almohad ruler, [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]] (patron of [[Averroes]] and [[Ibn Tufail]]), died in Santar\u00e9m while trying to recapture it during the [[Siege of Santar\u00e9m (1184)|siege of 1184]].\n\nAfter the reconquest of Santar\u00e9m, the city was frequently visited by the successive monarchs and many feudal parliaments (''[[Portuguese Cortes|Cortes]]'') were held in Santar\u00e9m. [[Fernando I of Portugal|King Fernando I]], in particular, was very fond of the city and chose to be buried in the Convent of Saint Francis (''Convento de S\u00e3o Francisco''). His tomb is now in the [[Carmo Convent (Lisbon)|Carmo Museum]] in Lisbon. The city was one of the most important in medieval Portugal, as attested by its large number of monasteries and its royal palace (no longer in existence but was located where the Cathedral currently stands). There are still enough examples of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] buildings in the city for it to be known as the \"Capital of the Portuguese Gothic\".\n\nIn the 15th century, during the period of [[Portuguese discoveries]], expeditions like the [[Battle of Ceuta|conquest of Ceuta]] (1415) were planned in the royal palace of Santar\u00e9m. Many important personalities related to this historical time are buried in the churches of Santar\u00e9m. ''Pedro de Meneses'', first governor of Ceuta (1415\u20131437) after the Portuguese conquest, is buried in a magnificent Gothic tomb in the Church of the Grace (''Igreja da Gra\u00e7a''). In the same church is also buried [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], the navigator that discovered [[Brazil]] in 1500.\n\nThe city was hit by earthquakes twice: one in [[1531 Lisbon earthquake|1531]] and the other in [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755]], which damaged the city and many historical monuments were lost. During the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic invasions]] in the early 19th century the city was invaded and pillaged.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century many improvements reached Santar\u00e9m, like running water, gas light, the building of a bridge over the [[Tagus]] and the railway in 1861. In the 20th century, the infrastructure of the city (education, housing, commerce) continued to improve and the economy of the city remained mainly dedicated to the production of agricultural goods.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Santarem1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cityscape of Santar\u00e9m]]\nThe city of Santar\u00e9m stands is situated on a plateau, located on the right bank of the [[Tagus River]] {{convert|65|km|mi}} northeast from Lisbon.

These include fine examples of transitional [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]\u2013[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], mendicant (plain style derived from the [[mendicant orders]]) and late (flamboyant) Gothic. In addition, the city has nice examples of [[Manueline]], [[Renaissance]], [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] architecture.\n\n*'''Old Castle of Santar\u00e9m''' (''Porta do Sol''): Located on a high slope over the [[Tagus]] river and the surrounding landscape, the site of the old castle of Santar\u00e9m is now a park. Part of the walls and towers of the castle are still preserved.\n*'''Church of Saint John of Alpor\u00e3o''' (''Igreja de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Alpor\u00e3o''): Built between the 12th and the 13th centuries by the [[Knights Hospitallers]], this church is an example of transitional architecture, with a Romanesque main portal and an early Gothic main chapel and [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]]. The arches of the [[ambulatory]] of the main chapel show Moorish ([[Mud\u00e9jar]]) influences. The church now houses a small '''Archaeological Museum'''. Its most important piece is the flamboyant Gothic tomb of ''Duarte de Meneses'' who disappeared in a battle in North Africa in 1465. His tomb is empty.\n*'''Caba\u00e7as Tower''' (''Torre das Caba\u00e7as''): Ancient defensive tower of the mediaeval wall of the city. Houses the '''Time Museum''' with an exhibition about the measurement of time through the ages.\n*'''Fountain of the Fig Trees''' (''Fonte das Figueiras''): Rare example of a 14th-century fountain in Portugal, decorated with [[merlon]]s and [[coats-of-arms]] of Portugal and [[Dinis I of Portugal|King Dinis I]].\n*'''Convent of Saint Claire''' (''Convento de Santa Clara''): 13th-century convent. Good example of Portuguese mendicant Gothic style. It also included a now lost altarpiece by the Mannerist artist [[Diogo de Contreiras]].\n*'''Convent of Saint Francis''' (''Convento de S\u00e3o Francisco''): Another 13th-century convent in medicant style. Has a nice Gothic cloister. [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|King Ferdinand I]] was buried here.\n*'''Church of St. Stephen \u2013 Church of the Holy Miracle''' (''Igreja do Sant\u00edssimo Milagre'') Home to the 13th-century Eucharistic Miracle of Santar\u00e9m, a popular destination among Catholics worldwide.\n*'''Church of the Grace''' (''Igreja da Gra\u00e7a''): Built between the 14th and 15th centuries in a mix of mendicant and flamboyant Gothic styles. Has a main portal and rose window (believed to be unique in the world, carved out of a single stone) that shows the influence of the [[Monastery of Batalha]]. The first governor of [[Ceuta]] ''[[Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real|Pedro de Meneses]]'' (died 1437) and his wife are buried here in a magnificent Gothic tomb with their recumbent figures holding each other's hands. [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], discoverer of [[Brazil]], and his wife are buried under a simple slab near the main chapel. The church was extensively renovated in the 1950s, eliminating all traces of development of the church later than 1500, so the current condition of the church provides a unique insight into a late 15th century church.\n*'''Church of Marvila''' (''Igreja de Marvila''): This 16th-century church has a nice portal and main chapel in [[Manueline]] style. The [[nave]] and [[pulpit]] are in early [[Renaissance]] style. The interior walls are covered with 17th-century-multicoloured [[tile]]s with geometric patterns. It has one of the most outstanding tile-based interior decorations in Portugal.\n*'''Cathedral of Santar\u00e9m''' (''S\u00e9-Catedral''): Built in the 17th century in [[mannerist]] style as the [[Jesuit]] church of the city, it became the [[Seminary]] church after the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus#First national suppression: Portugal and its empire in 1759|Jesuits were expelled from Portugal]] in the mid-18th century. The interior decoration is very rich, with [[altarpiece]]s from various periods and styles ([[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]]) and a ceiling with an illusionist painting. Since the 1970s it is the Cathedral of Santar\u00e9m. The site of the church and seminary was previously occupied by the medieval royal palace of Santar\u00e9m.\n\n==Notable citizens==\n* [[Moses Navarro]] (?-1370, Lisbon) was ''[[Crown rabbi (Iberia)|arrabi m\u00f4r]]'' (Chief Rabbi) in the court of [[Peter I of Portugal]] for 30 years, receiver of taxes and physician to the King.

Cabral conducted the first substantial exploration of the northeast coast of [[South America]] and claimed it for Portugal. He was probably born in the house of his father and family in [[Belmonte Municipality|Belmonte]] in [[Beira Baixa Province]]. His maternal side also had origin in [[Gouveia Municipality, Portugal|Gouveia]] and Santar\u00e9m, where his mother Dona Isabel Gouveia had received lands as a bequest from her brother Jo\u00e3o de Gouveia, the husband of Leonor Gon\u00e7alves, who owned vast estates in the capital of Ribatejo. It was in Santar\u00e9m that he was married in 1503 to Dona Isabel de Castro, whose family had owned property there for many years. A document dated 17 December 1509 reveals that Cabral had exchanged properties he owned in Pereiro, Santar\u00e9m, for \"a manor in Rossaio\" or Rossairo, south of the Santa Clara Road in a valley that lay between Santar\u00e9m and the lowlands, Ribeira de Santar\u00e9m. He may have lived there from time to time as of that date, but he also owned a house in the center of the town, more specifically in Marvila parish, next to Gra\u00e7a Church. Cabral lived in Santar\u00e9m until his death. He was buried within Santar\u00e9m's ''Igreja da Gra\u00e7a'', in a side-chapel of the church after his wife purchased a chapel for the family tomb in 1529.\n* [[Aires de Saldanha]] (1542\u20131605) was a nobleman, [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Viceroy of Portuguese India]] and [[List of governors of Tangier|Governor of Tangiers]].\n* [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda]] (c. 1500 \u2013 1559 in Coimbra) was a [[historian]] in the early [[Renaissance]].

Of the various legends related to the foundation of Santar\u00e9m, the most famous tells of the Visigoth [[Saint Iria]] (or Irene), who was martyred in [[Tomar]] (''Nabantia'') and whose uncorrupted body reached Santar\u00e9m. In her honour, the name of the town (then known by its Latin name ''Scalabis'') would later be changed to ''Sancta Irene'', from which ''Santar\u00e9m'' would eventually be derived.\n\nThe foundation of the city is attributed to the Romans, who occupied the region in the 2nd century BC and named the city ''[[Scalabis]]''. During the Roman period Scalabis was an important commercial post in the mid-Tagus region and was the administrative capital of one of the regions (''Conventus Scalabitanus'') of [[Lusitania]]. Julius Caesar ordered the creation of a military camp in Santar\u00e9m in 61 BC. The city takes at this time the designation of ''Scallabis Praesidium Iulium''.\n\nThe 3rd century crisis and the decline of the Western Roman Empire affected the'' civitas'' and in the 5th century the town was conquered by Germanic tribes ([[Vandals]] and [[Alans]]). In 460, the Visigoths, led by Sunerico, conquered the city and expelled the Alans.<ref>http://www.santaremdigital.com/historia-santarem</ref>\n\nAfter the period of Visigoth domination, Santar\u00e9m was taken in the 8th century by the [[Moors]], who named it ''Shantarin''. Under the rule of the Moors the city became an important cultural centre. Important Moor personalities born in Santar\u00e9m include the poet and historian [[Ibn Bassam]] (died 1147) and the poet [[Ibn Sara]] (1043\u20131123).\n\nThe period of Moorish domination was finished in 1147 by the first [[King of Portugal]], [[Afonso Henriques]], who conquered the city on March 15. According to period chronicles, the King and a small army managed to take the city after some men climbed the walls during the night and opened the gates. The story of the [[conquest of Santar\u00e9m]] is told in a heroic tone in the medieval chronicle ''De expugnatione Scalabis'', which celebrates and justifies the power of the first Portuguese King. From a military point of view, the conquest of Santar\u00e9m and, in that same year, of [[Siege of Lisbon|Lisbon]] were crucial steps in the [[Reconquista]] of Portugal.\n\nThe most notable Almohad ruler, [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]] (patron of [[Averroes]] and [[Ibn Tufail]]), died in Santar\u00e9m while trying to recapture it during the [[Siege of Santar\u00e9m (1184)|siege of 1184]].\n\nAfter the reconquest of Santar\u00e9m, the city was frequently visited by the successive monarchs and many feudal parliaments (''[[Portuguese Cortes|Cortes]]'') were held in Santar\u00e9m. [[Fernando I of Portugal|King Fernando I]], in particular, was very fond of the city and chose to be buried in the Convent of Saint Francis (''Convento de S\u00e3o Francisco''). His tomb is now in the [[Carmo Convent (Lisbon)|Carmo Museum]] in Lisbon. The city was one of the most important in medieval Portugal, as attested by its large number of monasteries and its royal palace (no longer in existence but was located where the Cathedral currently stands). There are still enough examples of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] buildings in the city for it to be known as the \"Capital of the Portuguese Gothic\".\n\nIn the 15th century, during the period of [[Portuguese discoveries]], expeditions like the [[Battle of Ceuta|conquest of Ceuta]] (1415) were planned in the royal palace of Santar\u00e9m. Many important personalities related to this historical time are buried in the churches of Santar\u00e9m. ''Pedro de Meneses'', first governor of Ceuta (1415\u20131437) after the Portuguese conquest, is buried in a magnificent Gothic tomb in the Church of the Grace (''Igreja da Gra\u00e7a''). In the same church is also buried [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], the navigator that discovered [[Brazil]] in 1500.\n\nThe city was hit by earthquakes twice: one in [[1531 Lisbon earthquake|1531]] and the other in [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755]], which damaged the city and many historical monuments were lost. During the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic invasions]] in the early 19th century the city was invaded and pillaged.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century many improvements reached Santar\u00e9m, like running water, gas light, the building of a bridge over the [[Tagus]] and the railway in 1861. In the 20th century, the infrastructure of the city (education, housing, commerce) continued to improve and the economy of the city remained mainly dedicated to the production of agricultural goods.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Santarem1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cityscape of Santar\u00e9m]]\nThe city of Santar\u00e9m stands is situated on a plateau, located on the right bank of the [[Tagus River]] {{convert|65|km|mi}} northeast from Lisbon.

These include fine examples of transitional [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]\u2013[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], mendicant (plain style derived from the [[mendicant orders]]) and late (flamboyant) Gothic. In addition, the city has nice examples of [[Manueline]], [[Renaissance]], [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] architecture.\n\n*'''Old Castle of Santar\u00e9m''' (''Porta do Sol''): Located on a high slope over the [[Tagus]] river and the surrounding landscape, the site of the old castle of Santar\u00e9m is now a park. Part of the walls and towers of the castle are still preserved.\n*'''Church of Saint John of Alpor\u00e3o''' (''Igreja de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Alpor\u00e3o''): Built between the 12th and the 13th centuries by the [[Knights Hospitallers]], this church is an example of transitional architecture, with a Romanesque main portal and an early Gothic main chapel and [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]]. The arches of the [[ambulatory]] of the main chapel show Moorish ([[Mud\u00e9jar]]) influences. The church now houses a small '''Archaeological Museum'''. Its most important piece is the flamboyant Gothic tomb of ''Duarte de Meneses'' who disappeared in a battle in North Africa in 1465. His tomb is empty.\n*'''Caba\u00e7as Tower''' (''Torre das Caba\u00e7as''): Ancient defensive tower of the mediaeval wall of the city. Houses the '''Time Museum''' with an exhibition about the measurement of time through the ages.\n*'''Fountain of the Fig Trees''' (''Fonte das Figueiras''): Rare example of a 14th-century fountain in Portugal, decorated with [[merlon]]s and [[coats-of-arms]] of Portugal and [[Dinis I of Portugal|King Dinis I]].\n*'''Convent of Saint Claire''' (''Convento de Santa Clara''): 13th-century convent. Good example of Portuguese mendicant Gothic style. It also included a now lost altarpiece by the Mannerist artist [[Diogo de Contreiras]].\n*'''Convent of Saint Francis''' (''Convento de S\u00e3o Francisco''): Another 13th-century convent in medicant style. Has a nice Gothic cloister. [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|King Ferdinand I]] was buried here.\n*'''Church of St. Stephen \u2013 Church of the Holy Miracle''' (''Igreja do Sant\u00edssimo Milagre'') Home to the 13th-century Eucharistic Miracle of Santar\u00e9m, a popular destination among Catholics worldwide.\n*'''Church of the Grace''' (''Igreja da Gra\u00e7a''): Built between the 14th and 15th centuries in a mix of mendicant and flamboyant Gothic styles. Has a main portal and rose window (believed to be unique in the world, carved out of a single stone) that shows the influence of the [[Monastery of Batalha]]. The first governor of [[Ceuta]] ''[[Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real|Pedro de Meneses]]'' (died 1437) and his wife are buried here in a magnificent Gothic tomb with their recumbent figures holding each other's hands. [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], discoverer of [[Brazil]], and his wife are buried under a simple slab near the main chapel. The church was extensively renovated in the 1950s, eliminating all traces of development of the church later than 1500, so the current condition of the church provides a unique insight into a late 15th century church.\n*'''Church of Marvila''' (''Igreja de Marvila''): This 16th-century church has a nice portal and main chapel in [[Manueline]] style. The [[nave]] and [[pulpit]] are in early [[Renaissance]] style. The interior walls are covered with 17th-century-multicoloured [[tile]]s with geometric patterns. It has one of the most outstanding tile-based interior decorations in Portugal.\n*'''Cathedral of Santar\u00e9m''' (''S\u00e9-Catedral''): Built in the 17th century in [[mannerist]] style as the [[Jesuit]] church of the city, it became the [[Seminary]] church after the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus#First national suppression: Portugal and its empire in 1759|Jesuits were expelled from Portugal]] in the mid-18th century. The interior decoration is very rich, with [[altarpiece]]s from various periods and styles ([[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]]) and a ceiling with an illusionist painting. Since the 1970s it is the Cathedral of Santar\u00e9m. The site of the church and seminary was previously occupied by the medieval royal palace of Santar\u00e9m.\n\n==Notable citizens==\n* [[Moses Navarro]] (?-1370, Lisbon) was ''[[Crown rabbi (Iberia)|arrabi m\u00f4r]]'' (Chief Rabbi) in the court of [[Peter I of Portugal]] for 30 years, receiver of taxes and physician to the King.

Cabral conducted the first substantial exploration of the northeast coast of [[South America]] and claimed it for Portugal. He was probably born in the house of his father and family in [[Belmonte Municipality|Belmonte]] in [[Beira Baixa Province]]. His maternal side also had origin in [[Gouveia Municipality, Portugal|Gouveia]] and Santar\u00e9m, where his mother Dona Isabel Gouveia had received lands as a bequest from her brother Jo\u00e3o de Gouveia, the husband of Leonor Gon\u00e7alves, who owned vast estates in the capital of Ribatejo. It was in Santar\u00e9m that he was married in 1503 to Dona Isabel de Castro, whose family had owned property there for many years. A document dated 17 December 1509 reveals that Cabral had exchanged properties he owned in Pereiro, Santar\u00e9m, for \"a manor in Rossaio\" or Rossairo, south of the Santa Clara Road in a valley that lay between Santar\u00e9m and the lowlands, Ribeira de Santar\u00e9m. He may have lived there from time to time as of that date, but he also owned a house in the center of the town, more specifically in Marvila parish, next to Gra\u00e7a Church. Cabral lived in Santar\u00e9m until his death.

Hayter would go on to play Solid Snake and his predecessor [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Naked Snake]] throughout all the succeeding installments (including spinoffs, re-releases and adaptations) up until ''[[Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker]]'' in 2010.

On June 14, 2005, they released ''Rarities'', a collection of B-sides and rare tracks partially decided by [[fan (person)|fans']] input, which fulfilled the album count obligation for their contract with Epic.\n\n=== Hollywood Records (2006\u201307) ===\n[[File:Indigo Girls 2005 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Indigo Girls performing in 2005.]]\nAfter departing Epic, the Indigo Girls signed a five-record deal with [[Hollywood Records]]. Their first (and only) Hollywood album, ''[[Despite Our Differences]]'', produced by [[Mitchell Froom]], was released on September 19, 2006. John Metzger from ''MusicBox Online'' described ''Despite our Differences'' as \"the most infectious, pop-infused set that the duo ever has managed to concoct.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In fact, its melodies, harmonies, and arrangements are so ingratiating that the album carries the weight of an instant classic.\" Thom Jurek from ''[[AllMusic]]'' wrote: \"part of an emotional journey as complete as can be. More relevant than anyone dared expect. It's accessible and moving and true. It's their own brand of rock & roll, hewn from over the years, that bears a signature that is now indelible. A moving, and utterly poetic offering.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAfter releasing ''Despite Our Differences'', the Indigo Girls' contract was terminated by Hollywood Records during their 2007 tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://events.press-citizen.com/iowacity/events/indigo-girls-/E0-001-092160491-9|title=Indigo Girls with the Cincinnati Pops|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Independent work (2007\u2013present) ===\n[[File:Indigo Girls Fillmore.jpg|thumb|align=right|Performing at [[The Fillmore]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] in 2018]]\nFollowing their break with Hollywood Records, the Indigo Girls announced their next record would be released independently.  ''[[Poseidon and the Bitter Bug]]'' was released on March 24, 2009, from IG Recordings, the Indigo Girls' label, and distributed through [[Vanguard Records]]. This album is their first fully independent release since 1987's ''Strange Fire'', and their first two-CD set since 1995's live album ''1200 Curfews''; the first disc has the 10 tracks accompanied by a backing band, and the second includes the same 10 songs with only Ray and Saliers on vocals and [[acoustic guitar]]s, and an additional track. On June 29, 2010 Indigo Girls' second full-length live album, ''Staring Down the Brilliant Dream'', was released on IG Recordings/Vanguard Records. This was followed on October 12, 2010 with their first holiday album ''Holly Happy Days''. Indigo Girls' thirteenth studio album, ''[[Beauty Queen Sister]]'', was released on October 4, 2011, and their fourteenth studio album, ''[[One Lost Day]]'', was released on June 2, 2015 (both on IG Recordings/Vanguard Records).\n\nBeginning in 2017, the Indigo Girls have toured the United States performing their music arranged for symphony orchestra. After more than fifty performances, in 2018 they released a live double album entitled ''[[Indigo Girls Live with the University of Colorado Symphony Orchestra]]''. In 2020, the followed this followed this with the studio album ''[[Look Long]]''.\n\n=== Songwriting ===\n{{section unsourced|date=May 2018}}\nRay and Saliers do not ordinarily collaborate in writing songs. They write separately and work out the [[arrangement]]s together. There are a few exceptions, mostly unreleased songs from their early, pre-Epic days: \"I Don't Know Your Name\" and \"If You Live Like That.\" \"Blood Quantum\", which appears on ''Honor: A Benefit for the [[Honor the Earth]] Campaign'' featured Ray's verses and chorus and Saliers's bridge. Finally, \"I'll Give You My Skin\", which appears both on ''[[Tame Yourself]]'' (a benefit album for [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]) and on the Indigo Girls release ''Rarities,'' is a collaborative work by Ray, Saliers, and [[Michael Stipe]] which is doubly rare, as Saliers and Ray usually write their songs without outside collaborators.\n\n== Touring band ==\nThe Indigo Girls have toured as a duo and with a band. In 1990, they toured with Atlanta band the [[Ellen James Society]] backing them; they have also toured with side players, with one distinct group from 1991 to 1998, a second from 1999 to 2006, and a third from 2012 onwards.\n\n;First touring band\n*[[Budgie (drummer)|Budgie]]&nbsp;- [[drums]] (1992)\n*[[Gail Ann Dorsey]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[bass guitar]] (1994)\n*[[Sara Lee (musician)|Sara Lee]]&nbsp;\u2013 bass guitar (1991\u201398)\n*[[Jerry Marotta]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums, [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] (1992\u201398)\n*[[Scarlet Rivera]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[violin]] (1992)\n*[[Jane Scarpantoni]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[cello]] (1992)\n\n;Second touring band\n*[[Brady Blade]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums (2002\u201304)\n*[[Matt Chamberlain]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums (2006\u20132009)\n*[[Blair Cunningham]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums (2000)\n*[[Caroline Dale]]&nbsp;\u2013 cello (1999)\n*Carol Isaacs&nbsp;\u2013 [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[accordion]] (1999\u20132007 and one show in [[Brighton]])\n*[[Clare Kenny]]&nbsp;\u2013 bass guitar (1999\u20132007)\n*[[Caroline Lavelle]]&nbsp;\u2013 cello (2000)\n*[[John Reynolds (musician)|John Reynolds]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums (1999)\n*Julie Wolf&nbsp;\u2013 [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], accordion (2008\u2013present)\n\n;Third touring band\n*Jaron Pearlman&nbsp;\u2013 drums (2012\u20132016)\n*Benjamin Ryan Williams&nbsp;\u2013 bass (2012\u20132016)\n*Lyris Hung&nbsp;\u2013 violin (2012\u2013present)\n\n== Solo projects ==\nIn 1990, Ray founded [[Daemon Records]], which has signed [[Magnapop]], [[Ellen James Society]], [[New Mongrels]], [[Kristen Hall]], [[Rose Polenzani]], [[Girlyman]], Athens Boys Choir, and [[James Hall (singer)|James Hall]] among others.\n\nRay has put out six solo albums, entitled ''[[Stag (Amy Ray album)|Stag]]'', ''[[Prom (album)|Prom]]'', ''[[Live from Knoxville]]'', ''[[Didn't It Feel Kinder]]'', ''[[Amy Ray: Live MVP]]'', ''[[Lung of Love]]'' ''Goodnight Tender'' and \"[[Hollert (Amy Ray album)|Holler]]\" through Daemon. She has toured with both [[The Butchies]] and her band [[The Volunteers (American band)|The Volunteers]].\n\nSaliers also released a solo album, ''Murmuration Nation'', in 2017, and was a founding co-owner of Watershed Restaurant<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watershedrestaurant.com |title=Decatur, GA |publisher=Watershed Restaurant |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref> in [[Decatur, Georgia]]. She sold Watershed in 2018. Saliers was an initial investor in the Flying Biscuit Cafe<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingbiscuit.com |title=The Flying Biscuit Cafe |publisher=Flyingbiscuit.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref> in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2005, Saliers and her father, [[Don Saliers]], a [[theology]] professor at [[Candler School of Theology]] at Emory University, released the book ''A Song to Sing, a Life to Live: Reflections on Music as Spiritual Practice''. They promoted the release of the book together including several days of speaking and performing together at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] College in [[Washington D.C.]]\n\n== Appearances in other media ==\nRay and Saliers appeared in the latter half of the feature film ''[[Boys on the Side]]'', playing short excerpts from their songs \"Joking\" and \"Southland in the Springtime,\" as well as singing \"Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os\" ([[Happy Birthday to You|\"Happy Birthday\"]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) with the gathered group of friends during the birthday cake scene, and standing on the far side of several shots over the next few scenes. Neither had any spoken lines. The duo also appear in the 2006 documentary ''[[Wordplay (film)|Wordplay]]'', where they discuss their reaction to appearing in a ''[[New York Times]]'' [[crossword puzzle]] and then begin to solve one together.\n\nRay and Saliers performed onstage in the 1994 revival of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' in [[Atlanta]], titled ''Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection''.  Ray played the role of [[Jesus]] and Saliers played the role of [[Mary Magdalene]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> They later reprised their roles in stagings of the musical in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], at the [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) festival, and in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]].\n\nThey made several cameo appearances on the [[Ellen DeGeneres]] sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''. In the episode \"Womyn Fest\" Ellen and her friends are attending a feminist music festival and catch the end of a performance by the Indigo Girls.\n\nThey are mentioned multiple times in the 1995 [[Stephen King]] novel [[Rose Madder (novel)|''Rose Madder'']] as well as being mentioned in TV shows ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Will and Grace]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[The Office (American TV series)|The Office]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'', ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', [[Tig Notaro]]'s special ''Happy To Be Here'', and ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'' .\n\nIn the 1996 slasher film ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'', a poster of the Indigo Girls can be seen on [[Neve Campbell]]'s character, [[Sidney Prescott]]\u2018s, bedroom wall.\n\nAppeared in 2018 onstage with standup comedian Tig Notaro's show \"Happy to be Here\" at The Heights in Houston, Texas, as a closing bit, performing one song.\n\n== Personal lives ==\nBoth Ray and Saliers have long identified themselves as [[lesbian]]s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA79&dq=%22indigo+girls%22+lesbian&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uyveUfOROdDyyAH31YH4CQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22indigo%20girls%22%20lesbian&f=false|title=No News is Good News|publisher=The Advocate|date=Feb 22, 1994|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref> Because of their engagements for [[LGBT rights]] they are regarded as icons of the movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/Colleges/HCLAS/LGBT/lgbt_symposium08.html |title=LGBT Studies \u2013 Symposium: Queer Iconography \u2013 Hofstra University |publisher=Hofstra.edu |date=2008-05-15 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222024637/http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/Colleges/HCLAS/LGBT/lgbt_symposium08.html |archivedate=2012-02-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/5821236 |title=Wanda Sykes, Natash Bedingfield, Indigo Girls Headline Milwaukee's Pride Lineup (ChicagoPride.com : Milwaukee, WI News) |publisher=ChicagoPride.com |date=2008-06-03 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref><ref name=Seely2008>{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Seely |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2008-07-02/music/mark-knopfler-a-bigger-gay-icon-than-george-michael/ |title=Mark Knopfler a Bigger Gay Icon Than George Michael?

For many years they incorporated a recycling and public outreach program into their road tours by including [[Greenpeace]] representative Stephanie Fairbanks in their road crew. They helped [[Winona LaDuke]] establish [[Honor the Earth]], an organization dedicated to creating support and education for native environmental issues. After performing on the activist-oriented Spitfire Tour in 1999, Ray and Saliers joined forces with The Spitfire Agency to develop the Honor The Earth Tour, which visits colleges and Native communities, and raises money for their non profit of the same name.

''[[Shaming of the Sun]]'' was released in 1997 followed by ''[[Come on Now Social]]'' in 1999.

The track \"Shame on You\" received more airplay on [[adult album alternative|adult alternative]], [[top 40]] and [[adult top 40]] radio stations than any of their previous singles, although this seemed to be a peak in their crossover success.\n\n''Retrospective'', a [[compilation album]] with two new tracks, was released in 2000 and ''[[Become You]]'' followed two years later. Their last [[Epic Records|Epic]] studio album was ''[[All That We Let In]]'', released in 2004 with an accompanying tour. On June 14, 2005, they released ''Rarities'', a collection of B-sides and rare tracks partially decided by [[fan (person)|fans']] input, which fulfilled the album count obligation for their contract with Epic.\n\n=== Hollywood Records (2006\u201307) ===\n[[File:Indigo Girls 2005 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Indigo Girls performing in 2005.]]\nAfter departing Epic, the Indigo Girls signed a five-record deal with [[Hollywood Records]]. Their first (and only) Hollywood album, ''[[Despite Our Differences]]'', produced by [[Mitchell Froom]], was released on September 19, 2006. John Metzger from ''MusicBox Online'' described ''Despite our Differences'' as \"the most infectious, pop-infused set that the duo ever has managed to concoct.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In fact, its melodies, harmonies, and arrangements are so ingratiating that the album carries the weight of an instant classic.\" Thom Jurek from ''[[AllMusic]]'' wrote: \"part of an emotional journey as complete as can be. More relevant than anyone dared expect. It's accessible and moving and true. It's their own brand of rock & roll, hewn from over the years, that bears a signature that is now indelible. A moving, and utterly poetic offering.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAfter releasing ''Despite Our Differences'', the Indigo Girls' contract was terminated by Hollywood Records during their 2007 tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://events.press-citizen.com/iowacity/events/indigo-girls-/E0-001-092160491-9|title=Indigo Girls with the Cincinnati Pops|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Independent work (2007\u2013present) ===\n[[File:Indigo Girls Fillmore.jpg|thumb|align=right|Performing at [[The Fillmore]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] in 2018]]\nFollowing their break with Hollywood Records, the Indigo Girls announced their next record would be released independently.  ''[[Poseidon and the Bitter Bug]]'' was released on March 24, 2009, from IG Recordings, the Indigo Girls' label, and distributed through [[Vanguard Records]]. This album is their first fully independent release since 1987's ''Strange Fire'', and their first two-CD set since 1995's live album ''1200 Curfews''; the first disc has the 10 tracks accompanied by a backing band, and the second includes the same 10 songs with only Ray and Saliers on vocals and [[acoustic guitar]]s, and an additional track. On June 29, 2010 Indigo Girls' second full-length live album, ''Staring Down the Brilliant Dream'', was released on IG Recordings/Vanguard Records. This was followed on October 12, 2010 with their first holiday album ''Holly Happy Days''. Indigo Girls' thirteenth studio album, ''[[Beauty Queen Sister]]'', was released on October 4, 2011, and their fourteenth studio album, ''[[One Lost Day]]'', was released on June 2, 2015 (both on IG Recordings/Vanguard Records).\n\nBeginning in 2017, the Indigo Girls have toured the United States performing their music arranged for symphony orchestra. After more than fifty performances, in 2018 they released a live double album entitled ''[[Indigo Girls Live with the University of Colorado Symphony Orchestra]]''. In 2020, the followed this followed this with the studio album ''[[Look Long]]''.\n\n=== Songwriting ===\n{{section unsourced|date=May 2018}}\nRay and Saliers do not ordinarily collaborate in writing songs. They write separately and work out the [[arrangement]]s together. There are a few exceptions, mostly unreleased songs from their early, pre-Epic days: \"I Don't Know Your Name\" and \"If You Live Like That.\" \"Blood Quantum\", which appears on ''Honor: A Benefit for the [[Honor the Earth]] Campaign'' featured Ray's verses and chorus and Saliers's bridge. Finally, \"I'll Give You My Skin\", which appears both on ''[[Tame Yourself]]'' (a benefit album for [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]) and on the Indigo Girls release ''Rarities,'' is a collaborative work by Ray, Saliers, and [[Michael Stipe]] which is doubly rare, as Saliers and Ray usually write their songs without outside collaborators.\n\n== Touring band ==\nThe Indigo Girls have toured as a duo and with a band. In 1990, they toured with Atlanta band the [[Ellen James Society]] backing them; they have also toured with side players, with one distinct group from 1991 to 1998, a second from 1999 to 2006, and a third from 2012 onwards.\n\n;First touring band\n*[[Budgie (drummer)|Budgie]]&nbsp;- [[drums]] (1992)\n*[[Gail Ann Dorsey]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[bass guitar]] (1994)\n*[[Sara Lee (musician)|Sara Lee]]&nbsp;\u2013 bass guitar (1991\u201398)\n*[[Jerry Marotta]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums, [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] (1992\u201398)\n*[[Scarlet Rivera]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[violin]] (1992)\n*[[Jane Scarpantoni]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[cello]] (1992)\n\n;Second touring band\n*[[Brady Blade]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums (2002\u201304)\n*[[Matt Chamberlain]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums (2006\u20132009)\n*[[Blair Cunningham]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums (2000)\n*[[Caroline Dale]]&nbsp;\u2013 cello (1999)\n*Carol Isaacs&nbsp;\u2013 [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[accordion]] (1999\u20132007 and one show in [[Brighton]])\n*[[Clare Kenny]]&nbsp;\u2013 bass guitar (1999\u20132007)\n*[[Caroline Lavelle]]&nbsp;\u2013 cello (2000)\n*[[John Reynolds (musician)|John Reynolds]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums (1999)\n*Julie Wolf&nbsp;\u2013 [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], accordion (2008\u2013present)\n\n;Third touring band\n*Jaron Pearlman&nbsp;\u2013 drums (2012\u20132016)\n*Benjamin Ryan Williams&nbsp;\u2013 bass (2012\u20132016)\n*Lyris Hung&nbsp;\u2013 violin (2012\u2013present)\n\n== Solo projects ==\nIn 1990, Ray founded [[Daemon Records]], which has signed [[Magnapop]], [[Ellen James Society]], [[New Mongrels]], [[Kristen Hall]], [[Rose Polenzani]], [[Girlyman]], Athens Boys Choir, and [[James Hall (singer)|James Hall]] among others.\n\nRay has put out six solo albums, entitled ''[[Stag (Amy Ray album)|Stag]]'', ''[[Prom (album)|Prom]]'', ''[[Live from Knoxville]]'', ''[[Didn't It Feel Kinder]]'', ''[[Amy Ray: Live MVP]]'', ''[[Lung of Love]]'' ''Goodnight Tender'' and \"[[Hollert (Amy Ray album)|Holler]]\" through Daemon. She has toured with both [[The Butchies]] and her band [[The Volunteers (American band)|The Volunteers]].\n\nSaliers also released a solo album, ''Murmuration Nation'', in 2017, and was a founding co-owner of Watershed Restaurant<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watershedrestaurant.com |title=Decatur, GA |publisher=Watershed Restaurant |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref> in [[Decatur, Georgia]]. She sold Watershed in 2018. Saliers was an initial investor in the Flying Biscuit Cafe<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingbiscuit.com |title=The Flying Biscuit Cafe |publisher=Flyingbiscuit.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref> in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2005, Saliers and her father, [[Don Saliers]], a [[theology]] professor at [[Candler School of Theology]] at Emory University, released the book ''A Song to Sing, a Life to Live: Reflections on Music as Spiritual Practice''. They promoted the release of the book together including several days of speaking and performing together at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] College in [[Washington D.C.]]\n\n== Appearances in other media ==\nRay and Saliers appeared in the latter half of the feature film ''[[Boys on the Side]]'', playing short excerpts from their songs \"Joking\" and \"Southland in the Springtime,\" as well as singing \"Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os\" ([[Happy Birthday to You|\"Happy Birthday\"]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) with the gathered group of friends during the birthday cake scene, and standing on the far side of several shots over the next few scenes. Neither had any spoken lines. The duo also appear in the 2006 documentary ''[[Wordplay (film)|Wordplay]]'', where they discuss their reaction to appearing in a ''[[New York Times]]'' [[crossword puzzle]] and then begin to solve one together.\n\nRay and Saliers performed onstage in the 1994 revival of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' in [[Atlanta]], titled ''Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection''.  Ray played the role of [[Jesus]] and Saliers played the role of [[Mary Magdalene]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> They later reprised their roles in stagings of the musical in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], at the [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) festival, and in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]].\n\nThey made several cameo appearances on the [[Ellen DeGeneres]] sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''.

The southern part of the town was formally separated to create Babylon in 1872.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nBecause Huntington was populated largely by English settlers, unlike the rest of the New Amsterdam colony, the town voted in 1660 to become part of the Connecticut colony rather than remain under the authority of New Amsterdam.  It was not until the British gained control of New Amsterdam in 1664 (renaming it New York) that Huntington was formally restored to the jurisdiction of New York.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Long Island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], British troops used Huntington as their headquarters, and remained encamped there until the end of the war.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nThe arrival of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] in 1867 transformed the economy of Huntington from primarily agriculture and shipping (based on its well protected harbor) to tourism and commuting.  Cold Spring Harbor became a popular summer resort.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nThe end of World War II brought about an explosive growth of population in Huntington, as in the rest of the region.

The southern part of the town was formally separated to create Babylon in 1872.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nBecause Huntington was populated largely by English settlers, unlike the rest of the New Amsterdam colony, the town voted in 1660 to become part of the Connecticut colony rather than remain under the authority of New Amsterdam.  It was not until the British gained control of New Amsterdam in 1664 (renaming it New York) that Huntington was formally restored to the jurisdiction of New York.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Long Island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], British troops used Huntington as their headquarters, and remained encamped there until the end of the war.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nThe arrival of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] in 1867 transformed the economy of Huntington from primarily agriculture and shipping (based on its well protected harbor) to tourism and commuting.  Cold Spring Harbor became a popular summer resort.<ref name=HoH/>\n\nThe end of World War II brought about an explosive growth of population in Huntington, as in the rest of the region.
