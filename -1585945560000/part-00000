Growing tensions led to a starker separation that was virtually complete by the time Jewish Christians refused to join in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Khokba Jewish revolt of 132]].<ref>Davidson, p.146</ref> Certain events are perceived as pivotal in the growing rift between Christianity and Judaism.\n\nThe [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] and the consequent dispersion of Jews and Jewish Christians from the city (after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]) ended any pre-eminence of the Jewish-Christian leadership in Jerusalem. Early Christianity grew further apart from Judaism to establish itself as a predominantly Gentile religion, and [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] became the first Gentile Christian community with stature.<ref>Franzen, p.25</ref>\n\nThe hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 85 is often stated to have condemned all who claimed the Messiah had already come, and Christianity in particular, excluding them from attending synagogue.<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

It is probable that the condemnation of Jamnia included many groups, of which the Christians were but one, and did not necessarily mean excommunication. That some of the later church fathers only recommended against [[synagogue]] attendance makes it improbable that an anti-Christian prayer was a common part of the synagogue liturgy. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries.<ref>Wylen (1995), p.190.</ref><ref>Wright, pp.164-165.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1st century, Judaism was a legal religion with the protection of [[Roman law]], worked out in compromise with the Roman state over two centuries (see [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire]] for details). In contrast, Christianity was not legalized until the 313 [[Edict of Milan]]. Observant Jews had special rights, including the privilege of abstaining from civic pagan rites. Christians were initially identified with the Jewish religion by the Romans, but as they became more distinct, Christianity became a problem for Roman rulers. Around the year 98, the emperor [[Nerva]] decreed that Christians did not have to pay the [[Fiscus Iudaicus|annual tax upon the Jews]], effectively recognizing them as distinct from [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. This opened the way to Christians being persecuted for disobedience to the emperor, as they refused to worship the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|state pantheon]].<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

For example, [[Pliny the Younger]] postulates that Christians are not Jews since they do not pay the tax, in his letters to [[Trajan]].<ref>Wylen, pp.190-192.</ref><ref>Dunn, pp.33-34.</ref>\n\n===Later rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. In Christian circles, ''[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]'' later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, generally holding the same beliefs except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\">Dauphin (1993). pp. 235, 240\u2013242.</ref> The [[Ebionites]] may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. They were considered by Gentile Christians to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and Gentile converts. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, ''Ebionite'' was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nThere was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both Gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. The true end of ancient Jewish Christianity occurred only in the 5th century.{{sfn|Dunn|1991}} Gentile Christianity became the dominant strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\"/>{{refn|group=note|Jewish Virtual Library: \"A major difficulty in tracing the growth of Christianity from its beginnings as a [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic sect]], and its relations to the various other normative-Jewish, sectarian-Jewish, and Christian-Jewish groups is presented by the fact that what ultimately became normative Christianity was originally but one among various contending Christian trends. Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the Church, the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).

Even though it is commonly thought that Paul established a Gentile church, it took centuries for a complete break to manifest. Growing tensions led to a starker separation that was virtually complete by the time Jewish Christians refused to join in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Khokba Jewish revolt of 132]].<ref>Davidson, p.146</ref> Certain events are perceived as pivotal in the growing rift between Christianity and Judaism.\n\nThe [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] and the consequent dispersion of Jews and Jewish Christians from the city (after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]) ended any pre-eminence of the Jewish-Christian leadership in Jerusalem. Early Christianity grew further apart from Judaism to establish itself as a predominantly Gentile religion, and [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] became the first Gentile Christian community with stature.<ref>Franzen, p.25</ref>\n\nThe hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 85 is often stated to have condemned all who claimed the Messiah had already come, and Christianity in particular, excluding them from attending synagogue.<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

It is probable that the condemnation of Jamnia included many groups, of which the Christians were but one, and did not necessarily mean excommunication. That some of the later church fathers only recommended against [[synagogue]] attendance makes it improbable that an anti-Christian prayer was a common part of the synagogue liturgy. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries.<ref>Wylen (1995), p.190.</ref><ref>Wright, pp.164-165.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1st century, Judaism was a legal religion with the protection of [[Roman law]], worked out in compromise with the Roman state over two centuries (see [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire]] for details). In contrast, Christianity was not legalized until the 313 [[Edict of Milan]]. Observant Jews had special rights, including the privilege of abstaining from civic pagan rites. Christians were initially identified with the Jewish religion by the Romans, but as they became more distinct, Christianity became a problem for Roman rulers. Around the year 98, the emperor [[Nerva]] decreed that Christians did not have to pay the [[Fiscus Iudaicus|annual tax upon the Jews]], effectively recognizing them as distinct from [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. This opened the way to Christians being persecuted for disobedience to the emperor, as they refused to worship the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|state pantheon]].<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

For example, [[Pliny the Younger]] postulates that Christians are not Jews since they do not pay the tax, in his letters to [[Trajan]].<ref>Wylen, pp.190-192.</ref><ref>Dunn, pp.33-34.</ref>\n\n===Later rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. In Christian circles, ''[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]'' later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, generally holding the same beliefs except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\">Dauphin (1993). pp. 235, 240\u2013242.</ref> The [[Ebionites]] may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. They were considered by Gentile Christians to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and Gentile converts. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, ''Ebionite'' was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nThere was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both Gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. The true end of ancient Jewish Christianity occurred only in the 5th century.{{sfn|Dunn|1991}} Gentile Christianity became the dominant strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\"/>{{refn|group=note|Jewish Virtual Library: \"A major difficulty in tracing the growth of Christianity from its beginnings as a [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic sect]], and its relations to the various other normative-Jewish, sectarian-Jewish, and Christian-Jewish groups is presented by the fact that what ultimately became normative Christianity was originally but one among various contending Christian trends. Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the Church, the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).

The work premiered at Madrid's Teatro Eslava on April 6, 1917.\n\n[[Sergei Diaghilev]] of the [[Ballets Russes]] had been introduced to de Falla by [[Igor Stravinsky]] during the company's first visit to Spain in 1916. He requested permission to use de Falla's already-completed ''Noches en los jardines de Espa\u00f1a'' (''[[Nights in the Gardens of Spain]]'') and the work-in-progress ''El corregidor y la molinera'' for future choreographies, but only managed to secure permission for the latter. \n\nIn preparation for producing Spanish choreography, Diaghilev and [[Leonid Massine]] enlisted the services of dancer F\u00e9lix Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, who accompanied the two men with de Falla on a tour of Spain in July 1917, introducing them to dancers and performances in Zaragoza, Toledo, Salamanca, Burgos, Sevilla, C\u00f3rdoba, and Granada. Massine, [[Pablo Picasso]], and de Falla worked separately on the choreography, sets/costumes, and music for the ballet over subsequent months; after some delays, the ballet was eventually premiered in London at the [[Alhambra Theatre]] on 22 July 1919. De Falla was called home to Granada at the last moment to see his dying mother; the premiere was conducted in his stead by [[Ernest Ansermet]].\n\n== Form ==\nThe story, of a magistrate infatuated with a miller's faithful wife who attempts to seduce her, derives from the [[The Three-Cornered Hat (novel)|novella of the same name]] by [[Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmcordoba.com/revista-musicalia/musicalia-numero-1/188-el-sombrero-de-tres-picos-de-manuel-de-falla |title=\u201cEl sombrero de tres picos\u201d, de Manuel de Falla |last=Bedmar Estrada |first=Luis Pedro |access-date=April 8, 2018 |work=Conservatorio Superior de M\u00fasica\"Rafael Orozco\" de C\u00f3rdoba\" |language=es}}</ref> and has been adapted to film several times, usually in Spanish.

The [[miller]] is trying to teach a pet blackbird to tell the time. He tells the bird to chirp twice, but instead it chirps three times. Annoyed, the miller scolds the bird and tells it to try again. The bird now chirps four times. The miller gets angry at the bird again and his wife offers it a grape. The bird takes the grape and chirps twice. The miller and his wife laugh over this and continue their work. \n\nSoon the [[magistrate]], his wife, and their bodyguard pass by, taking their daily walk. The procession goes by and the couple returns to their work. The dandified, but lecherous, magistrate is heard coming back. The miller tells his wife that he will hide and that they will play a trick on the magistrate. The miller hides and the magistrate sees the miller's wife dancing. After her dance, she offers him some grapes. When the magistrate gets the grapes, the miller's wife runs away with the magistrate following her. Finally, he catches her, and the miller jumps out of a bush with a stick. The miller chases the magistrate away and the miller and his wife continue working. \n\n=== Act II ===\nThat night, guests are at the miller's house. The miller dances to entertain them. His dance is interrupted by the magistrate's bodyguard, who has come to arrest him on trumped-up charges. After the miller is taken away, the guests leave one-by-one. The miller's wife goes to sleep and soon the magistrate comes to the mill. On his way to the door, the magistrate trips and falls in the river. The miller's wife wakes up and runs away. \n\nThe magistrate undresses, hangs his clothes on a tree, and goes to sleep in the miller's bed. The miller has escaped from prison and sees the magistrate in his bed. The miller thinks that the magistrate is sleeping with his wife and plans to switch clothes with the magistrate and avenge himself by seducing the magistrate's wife. The miller leaves, dressed as the magistrate, and the magistrate soon wakes up. He goes outside and sees that his clothes are gone, so he dresses in the miller's clothes.\n\nThe bodyguard comes and sees the magistrate dressed as the miller and goes to arrest him. The miller's wife sees the bodyguard fighting with what looks like her husband and joins in the fight. The miller comes back and sees his wife in the fight and joins it to protect her. The magistrate explains the entire story and the ballet ends with the miller's guests tossing the magistrate up and down in a blanket.\n\n== Music ==\nThroughout the ballet, Falla uses traditional [[Music of Andalusia|Andalusian folk music]]. The two songs sung by the [[mezzo-soprano]] are examples of ''[[cante jondo]]'' singing, which typically accompanies [[Flamenco|flamenco music]] and tells a sad story. At one point (the ''[[farruca]]''), he [[musical quotation|quotes]] the opening of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|5th Symphony]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mansfieldtickets.com/files/musicnotes/Hot%20Latin%20Nights/index.htm |title=Mansfield Tickets |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331220014/http://www.mansfieldtickets.com/files/musicnotes/Hot%20Latin%20Nights/index.htm |archivedate=2012-03-31 }}</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\nThere are many recordings of the complete ballet, as well as of the suites extracted from it. In the early 1960s, Ernest Ansermet, the original conductor, recorded it in [[stereo]] for [[London Records]]. The music was played by the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]] and the ''cante jondo'' soloist was [[Teresa Berganza]]. It has also been recorded by such conductors as [[Charles Dutoit]], [[Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos]], [[Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez-Cobos]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]],  and [[Leonard Bernstein]] has recorded the two suites from the ballet with the [[New York Philharmonic]]. (For a comparison of the Previn and Dutoit versions, see [[The Three-Cornered Hat (Andr\u00e9 Previn recording)|here]].)\n\nThe original pantomime ''El corregidor y la molinera'' has been recorded by [[Josep Pons]] and Orquestra del Teatro Lliure for [[Harmonia Mundi]].\n\n=== Film versions ===\nThe [[Paris Opera Ballet]] has issued a performance of the complete ballet on a DVD entitled ''Picasso and Dance''.

The two songs sung by the [[mezzo-soprano]] are examples of ''[[cante jondo]]'' singing, which typically accompanies [[Flamenco|flamenco music]] and tells a sad story. At one point (the ''[[farruca]]''), he [[musical quotation|quotes]] the opening of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|5th Symphony]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mansfieldtickets.com/files/musicnotes/Hot%20Latin%20Nights/index.htm |title=Mansfield Tickets |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331220014/http://www.mansfieldtickets.com/files/musicnotes/Hot%20Latin%20Nights/index.htm |archivedate=2012-03-31 }}</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\nThere are many recordings of the complete ballet, as well as of the suites extracted from it. In the early 1960s, Ernest Ansermet, the original conductor, recorded it in [[stereo]] for [[London Records]]. The music was played by the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]] and the ''cante jondo'' soloist was [[Teresa Berganza]]. It has also been recorded by such conductors as [[Charles Dutoit]], [[Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos]], [[Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez-Cobos]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]],  and [[Leonard Bernstein]] has recorded the two suites from the ballet with the [[New York Philharmonic]]. (For a comparison of the Previn and Dutoit versions, see [[The Three-Cornered Hat (Andr\u00e9 Previn recording)|here]].)\n\nThe original pantomime ''El corregidor y la molinera'' has been recorded by [[Josep Pons]] and Orquestra del Teatro Lliure for [[Harmonia Mundi]].\n\n=== Film versions ===\nThe [[Paris Opera Ballet]] has issued a performance of the complete ballet on a DVD entitled ''Picasso and Dance''. The performance uses not only Massine's original choreography, but actual reproductions of Picasso's sets and costumes.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006).
