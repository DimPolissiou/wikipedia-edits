The film features racial and social tensions in [[Los Angeles]]. A self-described \"passion piece\" for Haggis, ''Crash'' was inspired by a real-life incident in which his [[Porsche]] was [[Carjacking|carjacked]] in 1991 outside a video store on [[Wilshire Boulevard]].<ref>''Crash'' DVD Commentary Track. 2005.</ref> The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Matt Dillon]], [[Jennifer Esposito]], [[William Fichtner]],  [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Terrence Howard]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Thandie Newton]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], and [[Ryan Phillippe]].\n\n''Crash'' first premiered at the [[2004 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 10, 2004 before it was released in theaters on May 6, 2005 by [[Lionsgate Films]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the directing, screenplay, performances (particularly from Dillon), but earned polarized responses for its depiction and portrayal of [[Racism in the United States|race relations]]. The film was profitable at the box office, earning $98.4 million worldwide against its $6.5 million budget. \n\nThe film earned several accolades and nominations. Dillon was particularly praised for his performance and received Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, the cast won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]]. The film received six [[Academy Award]] nominations, and controversially won three for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]]. It was also nominated for nine BAFTA awards, and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actress]] for Thandie Newton.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie begins with Detective Graham Waters and his partner Ria being involved in a minor collision with a car being driven by Kim Lee. A subsequent exchange of racially charged insults occurs. Waters arrives at a crime scene where the body of a \"dead kid\" has been discovered. Earlier the previous day, Farhad, a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri are in a gun shop arguing over what bullets they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as \"[[Osama bin Laden|Osama]].\" Farhad is forced to leave the store and Dorri becomes responsible for the choice. \n\nLater that night, two black men, Anthony and Peter, [[carjack]] [[District Attorney]] Rick Cabot and his wife Jean. At the couple's house, the Hispanic [[locksmith]] Daniel Ruiz overhears Jean arguing with Rick, demanding that the locks be changed again as she suspects that Daniel is a gangster due to his tattoos and outfit. Daniel places the keys of the new locks on the kitchen counter and leaves.\n\nSergeant John Ryan and his partner Officer Tom Hansen pull over an [[SUV]] being driven by director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine, who was performing fellatio on him. After an intoxicated Christine mouths off to Ryan, he subjects the couple to a body search. Ryan molests Christine in front of her husband and Hansen, who watches in disgust. Ryan releases them with a warning after Cameron apologizes. \n\nIn the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a Korean man while passing a parked van, dump him in front of a hospital, and drive away. Daniel's next call is to replace a lock at Farhad's shop, but when Daniel warns Farhad that the real problem is the door, Farhad won't listen. The next day, Farhad finds that his store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti. Waters gets a phone call from his mother with dementia while having sex with his partner, Ria, which leads to an argument about her ethnicity. Waters later visits his mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.\n\nRyan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. Although she resists frantically at first, with the help of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls the terrified Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. Anthony and Peter carjack another Navigator, which happens to be Cameron's. Only after opening the door do they realize that Cameron is black. Police officers arrive on the scene and a chase ends with Cameron and Anthony in Cameron's car on a dead end residential street. Hansen is one of the pursuing officers and, out of guilt for the part he played in the assault of Cameron's wife, vouches for Cameron to be let off with a warning. Cameron expresses shame toward Anthony for his criminal lifestyle and drops him off near a bus stop.\n\nFarhad locates Daniel's house and waits in ambush, but as he confronts Daniel and shoots, Daniel's daughter jumps into Daniel's arms, attempting to protect her father. Everyone watches in horror as Daniel clutches his daughter, but they soon realize that she has not been shot and the family retreats inside. Farhad tells his daughter that he believes the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. He gives the gun to his daughter who is then seen going over near the cash register to retrieve the box of gun cartridges that her father had not known were actually blanks.\n\nHansen pulls over to pick up a hitchhiking Peter, who fled from the carjacking that took place earlier. Throughout the drive Hansen becomes more and more suspicious of Peter's intentions. Peter offends Hansen by suddenly beginning to laugh, and when Peter reaches for his pocket, Hansen shoots. In Peter's hand is a statuette similar to the one on Hansen's dash and, horrified, Hansen hides the body in some nearby bushes and burns his car. Waters arrives at the scene with his partner and the connection is made that Peter is his missing brother and the \"dead kid\". Waters is [[disowned]] by his mother for not finding Peter alive. \n\nAnthony decides to steal the van of the Korean man he accidentally hit and, when he drops it off at a chop shop he frequents, he discovers a number of Cambodian immigrants locked in the back of the van. The chop shop owner offers him $500 per immigrant but Anthony has other plans. After driving into [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] and setting the Cambodian people free, he passes by a car crash where, once again, an exchange of racially charged insults takes place.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}} \n===Main cast===\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Jean Cabot, Rick's wife\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Det.

And you can't judge these films like that. I'm very glad to have those Oscars. They're lovely things. But you shouldn't ask me what the best film of the year was because I wouldn't be voting for ''Crash'', only because I saw the artistry that was in the other films. Now however, for some reason that's the film that touched people the most that year. So I guess that's what they voted for, something that really touched them. And I'm very proud of the fact that ''Crash'' does touch you. People still come up to me more than any of my films and say: 'That film just changed my life.' I've heard that dozens and dozens and dozens of times. So it did its job there. I mean, I knew it was the social experiment that I wanted, so I think it's a really good social experiment.

The film features racial and social tensions in [[Los Angeles]]. A self-described \"passion piece\" for Haggis, ''Crash'' was inspired by a real-life incident in which his [[Porsche]] was [[Carjacking|carjacked]] in 1991 outside a video store on [[Wilshire Boulevard]].<ref>''Crash'' DVD Commentary Track. 2005.</ref> The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Matt Dillon]], [[Jennifer Esposito]], [[William Fichtner]],  [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Terrence Howard]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Thandie Newton]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], and [[Ryan Phillippe]].\n\n''Crash'' first premiered at the [[2004 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 10, 2004 before it was released in theaters on May 6, 2005 by [[Lionsgate Films]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the directing, screenplay, performances (particularly from Dillon), but earned polarized responses for its depiction and portrayal of [[Racism in the United States|race relations]]. The film was profitable at the box office, earning $98.4 million worldwide against its $6.5 million budget. \n\nThe film earned several accolades and nominations. Dillon was particularly praised for his performance and received Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, the cast won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]]. The film received six [[Academy Award]] nominations, and controversially won three for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]]. It was also nominated for nine BAFTA awards, and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actress]] for Thandie Newton.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie begins with Detective Graham Waters and his partner Ria being involved in a minor collision with a car being driven by Kim Lee. A subsequent exchange of racially charged insults occurs. Waters arrives at a crime scene where the body of a \"dead kid\" has been discovered. Earlier the previous day, Farhad, a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri are in a gun shop arguing over what bullets they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as \"[[Osama bin Laden|Osama]].\" Farhad is forced to leave the store and Dorri becomes responsible for the choice. \n\nLater that night, two black men, Anthony and Peter, [[carjack]] [[District Attorney]] Rick Cabot and his wife Jean. At the couple's house, the Hispanic [[locksmith]] Daniel Ruiz overhears Jean arguing with Rick, demanding that the locks be changed again as she suspects that Daniel is a gangster due to his tattoos and outfit. Daniel places the keys of the new locks on the kitchen counter and leaves.\n\nSergeant John Ryan and his partner Officer Tom Hansen pull over an [[SUV]] being driven by director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine, who was performing fellatio on him. After an intoxicated Christine mouths off to Ryan, he subjects the couple to a body search. Ryan molests Christine in front of her husband and Hansen, who watches in disgust. Ryan releases them with a warning after Cameron apologizes. \n\nIn the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a Korean man while passing a parked van, dump him in front of a hospital, and drive away. Daniel's next call is to replace a lock at Farhad's shop, but when Daniel warns Farhad that the real problem is the door, Farhad won't listen. The next day, Farhad finds that his store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti. Waters gets a phone call from his mother with dementia while having sex with his partner, Ria, which leads to an argument about her ethnicity. Waters later visits his mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.\n\nRyan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. Although she resists frantically at first, with the help of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls the terrified Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. Anthony and Peter carjack another Navigator, which happens to be Cameron's. Only after opening the door do they realize that Cameron is black. Police officers arrive on the scene and a chase ends with Cameron and Anthony in Cameron's car on a dead end residential street. Hansen is one of the pursuing officers and, out of guilt for the part he played in the assault of Cameron's wife, vouches for Cameron to be let off with a warning. Cameron expresses shame toward Anthony for his criminal lifestyle and drops him off near a bus stop.\n\nFarhad locates Daniel's house and waits in ambush, but as he confronts Daniel and shoots, Daniel's daughter jumps into Daniel's arms, attempting to protect her father. Everyone watches in horror as Daniel clutches his daughter, but they soon realize that she has not been shot and the family retreats inside. Farhad tells his daughter that he believes the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. He gives the gun to his daughter who is then seen going over near the cash register to retrieve the box of gun cartridges that her father had not known were actually blanks.\n\nHansen pulls over to pick up a hitchhiking Peter, who fled from the carjacking that took place earlier. Throughout the drive Hansen becomes more and more suspicious of Peter's intentions. Peter offends Hansen by suddenly beginning to laugh, and when Peter reaches for his pocket, Hansen shoots. In Peter's hand is a statuette similar to the one on Hansen's dash and, horrified, Hansen hides the body in some nearby bushes and burns his car. Waters arrives at the scene with his partner and the connection is made that Peter is his missing brother and the \"dead kid\". Waters is [[disowned]] by his mother for not finding Peter alive. \n\nAnthony decides to steal the van of the Korean man he accidentally hit and, when he drops it off at a chop shop he frequents, he discovers a number of Cambodian immigrants locked in the back of the van. The chop shop owner offers him $500 per immigrant but Anthony has other plans. After driving into [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] and setting the Cambodian people free, he passes by a car crash where, once again, an exchange of racially charged insults takes place.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}} \n===Main cast===\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Jean Cabot, Rick's wife\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Det.

Ang Lee's ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', great film. And Spielberg's ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]''. I mean please, what a year. ''Crash'', for some reason, affected people, it touched people. And you can't judge these films like that. I'm very glad to have those Oscars. They're lovely things. But you shouldn't ask me what the best film of the year was because I wouldn't be voting for ''Crash'', only because I saw the artistry that was in the other films. Now however, for some reason that's the film that touched people the most that year. So I guess that's what they voted for, something that really touched them. And I'm very proud of the fact that ''Crash'' does touch you. People still come up to me more than any of my films and say: 'That film just changed my life.' I've heard that dozens and dozens and dozens of times. So it did its job there. I mean, I knew it was the social experiment that I wanted, so I think it's a really good social experiment.

Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states. It is known as the \"Constitution State\", the \"Nutmeg State\", the \"Provisions State\", and the \"Land of Steady Habits\".<ref name=\"SOTS\" /> It was influential in development of the federal government of the United States (see [[Connecticut Compromise]]).\n\nThe Connecticut River, [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton).

Weicker Jr.]], an independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%.

However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction. Since New York and Massachusetts have higher tax rates than Connecticut, this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld.

The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state.

Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]].

Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

CPMs are largely dependent upon network effects and thus increase as a website scales and adds users. As such, Pandora's strategy in order to allow for widespread distribution was to offer a service unbundled from devices and transport. Pandora also works with system-on-chip manufacturers to embed its technologies on the chips they sell to consumer electronics manufacturers like [[Panasonic]], [[Samsung]], and [[Sony]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2010/10/an-update-on-pa.html/ | title=An Update on Pandora in Your Living Room | accessdate=December 2, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128225153/http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2010/10/an-update-on-pa.html | archivedate=November 28, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nPandora's cost structure is highly variable, with content acquisition costs representing roughly 50% of total costs.<ref name=\"sec.gov\" /> There are three main costs associated with content acquisition. First, [[SoundExchange]] collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves. These are by far the largest content acquisition costs.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Second, Pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], [[ASCAP]], or [[SESAC]] in order to compensate composers, songwriters and publishers. Lastly, Pandora also pays [[TiVo Corporation]] for song and artist information; this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee.\n\nHigh variable costs mean that Pandora does not have significant [[operating leverage]], and in the next couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile. Pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly one-ninth the rate of desktop hours.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-11/pandora-slow-to-lure-mobile-ad-dollars-even-as-ipad-listeners-flock-tech.html/ | title=Pandora Slow to Lure Mobile-Ad Dollars Even as Users Flock | accessdate=December 2, 2011 | work=Bloomberg | first1=Andy | last1=Fixmer | first2=Ari | last2=Levy | date=October 11, 2011}}</ref> Since Pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the user's platform, the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours.

Finally, in 2013 industry-wide total radio ad revenue increased to $17.6 billion in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-20/pandora-can-extend-lead-in-online-music-cfo-herring-says.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Anthony | last=Palazzo | title=Pandora Can Extend Lead in Online Music, CFO Herring Says | date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Pitch to advertisers ===\nPandora obtains its advertisers by explaining that the company reaches a narrower audience compared to terrestrial radio. \"Pandora's pitch to advertisers is that its technology can cater to consumers with far greater precision than radio \u2013 it can pinpoint listeners by age and sex, ZIP code or even musical taste.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\" />\n\n=== Methods of advertising ===\nThere are a few different methods of advertising on Pandora. Audio advertising comes in spots of 15 to 30 seconds, and run once every 20 minutes. However, users only encounter ads if they are engaging with the site, like contributing a thumbs up or a thumbs down when changing a song or station.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/business/media/pandora-courts-local-advertisers-by-reaching-a-narrow-audience.html|title=Pandora Courts Local Advertisers by Reaching a Narrow Audience|first1=Ben|last1=Sisario|first2=Tanzina|last2=Vega|date=April 15, 2012|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nNext, there are [[banner ads]] which are featured on the wallpaper of the site. As noted by ''[[the New York Times]]'', banner ads are on Pandora in order \"to promote engagement, audio segments can be accompanied by clickable display ads offering coupons or product information.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nAdvertising on Pandora works through a method of collecting [[data]] from the users online browsing activity. Once the [[data]] is collected, the company uses the data to show the user target ads. This process of advertising is also known as [[behavioral advertising]]. Pandora offers its users the option of submitting out of the targeted ads, by an opt-out configuration on its website. Opting-out will only prevent targeted ads, meaning users may continue to see generic (non-targeted ads) from these companies after they opt-out. Eventually, Pandora offers either targeted [[advertisements]] or generic advertisements for its non-subscribed users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/advertising/preferences|title=Your Advertising Choices|publisher=}}</ref> However, Pandora's advertising does not offer local content such as the local news, weather, traffic, and talk.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\" />\n\n=== Market segments ===\nPandora has created two [[market segment]]s, one for Spanish listeners, and another for English listeners. By creating multiple market segments, Pandora's advertising is customized to its users' needs. In order to create the first two market segments, the company cross-referenced its registered user data with [[U.S. census]]. Then, the cross reference allows the company to identify zip codes with high populations of Hispanic and Spanish-speaking people, and finally it ran tests overlaying the two data sets to infer which listeners fit into those buckets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/digital/pandora-past-tracking-cookie-mining-user-data/245269/ |title=Pandora Looks Past the Tracking Cookie By Mining User Data|author=Tim Peterson |date=November 14, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Internet radio stations]]\n* [[List of online music databases]]\n* [[List of streaming media systems]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/101/pandora.html Pandora featured in Fast Company]\n* [http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2007/05/03/closing-pandoras-box-the-end-of-internet-radio/ Closing Pandora's Box: The End of Internet Radio?], May 3, 2007 interview with Tim Westergren\n* [http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9821318-7.html Pandora adds classical music]\n* [http://intruders.tv/en-tech/the-story-of-pandora-so-far-from-founder-tim-westergren/ Interview with Tim Westergren about the Music Genome Project and Pandora]\n* [http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/President-of-the-USA-Rocker-Challenges-Pandora-905442.htm Dave Dederer & nuTsie Challenge Pandora]\n* [http://www.inc.com/magazine/20071001/pandoras-long-strange-trip.html Inc.

CPMs are largely dependent upon network effects and thus increase as a website scales and adds users. As such, Pandora's strategy in order to allow for widespread distribution was to offer a service unbundled from devices and transport. Pandora also works with system-on-chip manufacturers to embed its technologies on the chips they sell to consumer electronics manufacturers like [[Panasonic]], [[Samsung]], and [[Sony]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2010/10/an-update-on-pa.html/ | title=An Update on Pandora in Your Living Room | accessdate=December 2, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128225153/http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2010/10/an-update-on-pa.html | archivedate=November 28, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nPandora's cost structure is highly variable, with content acquisition costs representing roughly 50% of total costs.<ref name=\"sec.gov\" /> There are three main costs associated with content acquisition. First, [[SoundExchange]] collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves. These are by far the largest content acquisition costs.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Second, Pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], [[ASCAP]], or [[SESAC]] in order to compensate composers, songwriters and publishers. Lastly, Pandora also pays [[TiVo Corporation]] for song and artist information; this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee.\n\nHigh variable costs mean that Pandora does not have significant [[operating leverage]], and in the next couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile. Pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly one-ninth the rate of desktop hours.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-11/pandora-slow-to-lure-mobile-ad-dollars-even-as-ipad-listeners-flock-tech.html/ | title=Pandora Slow to Lure Mobile-Ad Dollars Even as Users Flock | accessdate=December 2, 2011 | work=Bloomberg | first1=Andy | last1=Fixmer | first2=Ari | last2=Levy | date=October 11, 2011}}</ref> Since Pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the user's platform, the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours.

Though not illegal, this practice raised comparisons to [[payola]], which is illegal payment for airplay on terrestrial radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/26/366339553/pandoras-new-deal-different-pay-different-play|title=Pandora's New Deal: Different Pay, Different Play|date=November 26, 2014|work=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\nOn September 15, 2016, Pandora released \"Pandora Plus\", a new subscription service to compete with other streaming services; the price was set at $4.99 and was available in later months.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pandora-media-pandoraplus-idUSKCN11L1HZ |title=Pandora launches \"Pandora\" Plus replacing Pandora One |last= |first= |date=September 15, 2016 |website=[[reuters.com]] |accessdate=September 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nIn May 2010, Pandora was named in [[Lead411]]'s 2010 Hottest [[San Francisco]] Companies list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lead411.com/san-francisco-companies.html |title=Lead411 launches \"Hottest Companies in San Francisco\" awards |publisher=Lead411.com |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=April 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017093224/http://www.lead411.com/san-francisco-companies.html |archivedate=October 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2013, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' compared a number of music services and granted Pandora a \"B-\", writing, \"Free streaming radio, $36 a year for ad-free.

The price rose to $4.99 a month in July 2014. The annual subscription was brought back and is now $54.89 a year.\n\n== Advertising ==\nPandora initially offered a subscription-only service without commercials. However, the idea of paying did not sit well with most U.S. consumers and the company had to consider alternative business models to offer a free service. Then, in December 2005 Pandora sold its first advertisement.<ref name=\"Music Genome Project 2012\">\"Pandora Radio/Music Genome Project.\" Innovation Masters: History's Best Examples of Business Transformation.

Starting from 2010 to 2012 Pandora's registered users had increased from 45 million to 125 million. The company's revenue increased from $55 million to $274 million, in which a majority of it from advertising. In order to appeal to a large audience of consumers, Pandora offers ad-free access for $36 a year.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/business/media/pandora-courts-local-advertisers-by-reaching-a-narrow-audience.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=Ben | last1=Sisario | first2=Tanzina | last2=Vega | title=Pandora Courts Local Advertisers by Reaching a Narrow Audience | date=April 15, 2012}}</ref> During its 2011 fiscal year, Pandora reported $138 million in revenue with a $1.8 million net loss, excluding the cost of a special dividend associated with the IPO.<ref>Pandora Media, Inc. \"[http://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC.Enhanced/SecCapsule.aspx?c=227956&fid=7621947 Prospectus, SEC Form S-1].\" June 14, 2011.

Finally, in 2013 industry-wide total radio ad revenue increased to $17.6 billion in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-20/pandora-can-extend-lead-in-online-music-cfo-herring-says.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Anthony | last=Palazzo | title=Pandora Can Extend Lead in Online Music, CFO Herring Says | date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Pitch to advertisers ===\nPandora obtains its advertisers by explaining that the company reaches a narrower audience compared to terrestrial radio. \"Pandora's pitch to advertisers is that its technology can cater to consumers with far greater precision than radio \u2013 it can pinpoint listeners by age and sex, ZIP code or even musical taste.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\" />\n\n=== Methods of advertising ===\nThere are a few different methods of advertising on Pandora. Audio advertising comes in spots of 15 to 30 seconds, and run once every 20 minutes. However, users only encounter ads if they are engaging with the site, like contributing a thumbs up or a thumbs down when changing a song or station.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/business/media/pandora-courts-local-advertisers-by-reaching-a-narrow-audience.html|title=Pandora Courts Local Advertisers by Reaching a Narrow Audience|first1=Ben|last1=Sisario|first2=Tanzina|last2=Vega|date=April 15, 2012|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nNext, there are [[banner ads]] which are featured on the wallpaper of the site. As noted by ''[[the New York Times]]'', banner ads are on Pandora in order \"to promote engagement, audio segments can be accompanied by clickable display ads offering coupons or product information.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nAdvertising on Pandora works through a method of collecting [[data]] from the users online browsing activity. Once the [[data]] is collected, the company uses the data to show the user target ads. This process of advertising is also known as [[behavioral advertising]]. Pandora offers its users the option of submitting out of the targeted ads, by an opt-out configuration on its website. Opting-out will only prevent targeted ads, meaning users may continue to see generic (non-targeted ads) from these companies after they opt-out. Eventually, Pandora offers either targeted [[advertisements]] or generic advertisements for its non-subscribed users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/advertising/preferences|title=Your Advertising Choices|publisher=}}</ref> However, Pandora's advertising does not offer local content such as the local news, weather, traffic, and talk.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\" />\n\n=== Market segments ===\nPandora has created two [[market segment]]s, one for Spanish listeners, and another for English listeners. By creating multiple market segments, Pandora's advertising is customized to its users' needs. In order to create the first two market segments, the company cross-referenced its registered user data with [[U.S. census]]. Then, the cross reference allows the company to identify zip codes with high populations of Hispanic and Spanish-speaking people, and finally it ran tests overlaying the two data sets to infer which listeners fit into those buckets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/digital/pandora-past-tracking-cookie-mining-user-data/245269/ |title=Pandora Looks Past the Tracking Cookie By Mining User Data|author=Tim Peterson |date=November 14, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Internet radio stations]]\n* [[List of online music databases]]\n* [[List of streaming media systems]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/101/pandora.html Pandora featured in Fast Company]\n* [http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2007/05/03/closing-pandoras-box-the-end-of-internet-radio/ Closing Pandora's Box: The End of Internet Radio?], May 3, 2007 interview with Tim Westergren\n* [http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9821318-7.html Pandora adds classical music]\n* [http://intruders.tv/en-tech/the-story-of-pandora-so-far-from-founder-tim-westergren/ Interview with Tim Westergren about the Music Genome Project and Pandora]\n* [http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/President-of-the-USA-Rocker-Challenges-Pandora-905442.htm Dave Dederer & nuTsie Challenge Pandora]\n* [http://www.inc.com/magazine/20071001/pandoras-long-strange-trip.html Inc.

This leaves these professors answerable to the NU-Q Dean, a situation that is not dissimilar to faculty members at Northwestern's Evanston Campus. In Qatar, however, a report by Stephen Eiesenman, former President of Northwestern Faculty Senate, pointed out that the Dean has much more authority than in the United States. Additionally, if a faculty member is no longer employed by NU-Q, they must leave the country, forcing them to uproot their lives there, a situation which no doubt puts pressure on the faculty member to work within the confines of a more limited set of academic and intellectual freedoms. Additionally, faculty members at NU-Q are not eligible for tenure unless they are visiting from the Evanston or Chicago campuses.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMany professors at Doha campuses of U.S. universities are incentivized to trade in their teaching positions in the U.S. for ones in Qatar with a salary premium, housing arrangements and research funding.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Community ==\nIn addition to its core mission of providing undergraduate education to its students, NU-Q seeks to serve as a regional center for issues related to communication and journalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2010/12/nuq-dean-everette-dennis.html|title=Everette E.

In Qatar, however, a report by Stephen Eiesenman, former President of Northwestern Faculty Senate, pointed out that the Dean has much more authority than in the United States. Additionally, if a faculty member is no longer employed by NU-Q, they must leave the country, forcing them to uproot their lives there, a situation which no doubt puts pressure on the faculty member to work within the confines of a more limited set of academic and intellectual freedoms.

Additionally, some members of Northwestern's faculty have expressed \u201cdissatisfaction with the academic and free speech protections\u201d. In an interview with the Washington Post, former Northwestern Faculty Senate President, Stephen Eisenman, said that \u201cteaching journalism as an enterprise in which you must first learn what not to ask, is no kind of journalism instruction at all\u201d and continued that at NU-Q this was \u201clikely a matter of encouraging some enquiries and making others strange, awkward, rude or unserious\u201d.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/12/17/northwestern-professor-raises-questions-about-its-branch-in-qatar/|title=Northwestern professor raises questions about its branch in Qatar|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref><ref name=\":3\"/><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/02/23/northwestern-university-will-stay-another-decade-in-qatar/|title=Northwestern University will stay a decade longer in Qatar|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>\n\nIn an article by The Washington Post, Susan Dun, an assistant professor of communication at NU-Q said that some professors do exercise caution with statements, written work, or speeches that may reach a wider audience than just the Education City community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/12/17/can-u-s-universities-thrive-in-the-persian-gulf-these-scholars-say-yes/|title=Can U.S. universities thrive in the Persian Gulf?

Students have been harassed and intimidated when trying to capture images that would be considered routine or not offensive in the U.S. Some faculty members maintain that this teaches students persistence and creativity in overcoming obstacles to report on a story.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEverette Dennis, the dean of NU-Q led a six-nation survey in 2015 that was financed by the Qatar National Research Fund and asked questions such as if people think their country is \u201cheaded in the right direction\u201d. While the UAE, Egypt, Tunisia, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia all had answers to the question, there was no data from Qatar as the government blocked the question from being asked to survey participants.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.qatar.northwestern.edu/ Northwestern University in Qatar] official website\n\n{{Northwestern}}\n\n[[Category:Universities in Qatar]]\n[[Category:Northwestern University]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2008]]\n[[Category:2008 establishments in Qatar]]\n[[Category:Education City]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University_in_Qatar"}
