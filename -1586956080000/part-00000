{"title_page": "Timeline of the Irish Civil War", "text_new": "{{Use Irish English|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\nThis is a '''timeline of the Irish Civil War''', which took place between June 1922 and May 1923. It followed the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919\u20131921), and accompanied the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] as an entity independent from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThe conflict was waged between two opposing groups of [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]]: the forces of the new Irish Free State, who supported the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] under which the state was established, and the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] opposition, for whom the Treaty represented a betrayal of the [[Irish Republic]].\n\nThe government of the Irish Free State (established as a provisional government in January 1922 and as a full government in December 1922) was ultimately victorious. The [[anti-Treaty forces]] called a ceasefire in April 1923 and ordered their men to \"dump arms\" in May 1923.\n\nThe war involved both [[conventional warfare]] (late June\u2013August 1922) when the Free State forces took the major towns and cities, and then a longer period of [[guerrilla warfare]] (September 1922\u2013April 1923) as the anti-Treaty forces were gradually brought to a standstill.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Build up==\n\n===January 1922===\n*7 January{{spaced ndash}}The Anglo-Irish Treaty is passed in the [[Second D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il]] (Parliament of the Irish Republic) by [[Anglo-Irish Treaty D\u00e1il vote|64 votes to 57]].\n*14 January{{spaced ndash}}A Provisional Government is set up to administer the handover from British rule to the new Irish Free State.

After negotiations between the mayor of Limerick, [[Stephen M.

It followed the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919\u20131921), and accompanied the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] as an entity independent from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThe conflict was waged between two opposing groups of [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]]: the forces of the new Irish Free State, who supported the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] under which the state was established, and the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] opposition, for whom the Treaty represented a betrayal of the [[Irish Republic]].\n\nThe government of the Irish Free State (established as a provisional government in January 1922 and as a full government in December 1922) was ultimately victorious. The [[anti-Treaty forces]] called a ceasefire in April 1923 and ordered their men to \"dump arms\" in May 1923.\n\nThe war involved both [[conventional warfare]] (late June\u2013August 1922) when the Free State forces took the major towns and cities, and then a longer period of [[guerrilla warfare]] (September 1922\u2013April 1923) as the anti-Treaty forces were gradually brought to a standstill.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Build up==\n\n===January 1922===\n*7 January{{spaced ndash}}The Anglo-Irish Treaty is passed in the [[Second D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il]] (Parliament of the Irish Republic) by [[Anglo-Irish Treaty D\u00e1il vote|64 votes to 57]].\n*14 January{{spaced ndash}}A Provisional Government is set up to administer the handover from British rule to the new Irish Free State.

{"title_page": "Electrical reactance", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Reactance (physics)||Reactance (disambiguation){{!}}Reactance}}\nIn electric and electronic systems, '''reactance''' is the opposition of a [[circuit element]] to the flow of [[electric current|current]] due to that element's [[inductance]] or [[capacitance]]. Larger reactance leads to smaller currents for the same voltage applied. Reactance is similar to [[electric resistance]], but it differs in several respects.\n\nReactance is used to compute amplitude and phase changes of [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] [[alternating current]] going through a circuit element. It is denoted by the symbol <math>\\scriptstyle{X}</math>. An ideal [[resistor]] has zero reactance, whereas ideal [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s have zero resistance &ndash; that is, respond to current only by reactance. As frequency goes up, inductive reactance also goes up and capacitive reactance goes down.\n\n== Comparison to resistance ==\nReactance is similar to resistance in that larger reactance leads to smaller currents for the same applied voltage. Further, a circuit made entirely of elements that have only reactance (and no resistance) can be treated the same way as a circuit made entirely of elements with no reactance (pure resistance). These same techniques can also be used to combine elements with reactance with elements with resistance but [[complex numbers]] are typically needed. This is treated below in the section on [[electrical impedance|impedance]].\n\nThere are several important differences between reactance and resistance, though. First, reactance changes the phase so that the current through the element is shifted by a quarter of a cycle relative to the voltage applied across the element. Second, power is not dissipated in a purely reactive element but is stored instead. Third, reactances can be negative so that they can 'cancel' each other out. Finally, the main circuit elements that have reactance (capacitors and inductors) have a frequency dependent reactance, unlike resistors which typically have the same resistance for all frequencies.\n\n== Capacitive reactance ==\n\n{{main|Capacitance}}\nA capacitor consists of two [[Electric conduction|conductor]]s separated by an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], also known as a [[dielectric]].\n\n''Capacitive reactance'' is an opposition to the change of voltage across an element. Capacitive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> is [[inversely proportional]] to the signal [[frequency]] <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> (or [[angular frequency]] \u03c9) and the [[capacitance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{C}</math>.<ref name=\"Irwin\">Irwin, D.

When the [[potential]] associated with the charge exactly balances the applied voltage, the current goes to zero.\n\nDriven by an AC supply (ideal AC current source), a capacitor will only accumulate a limited amount of charge before the potential difference changes polarity and the charge is returned to the source.  The higher the frequency, the less charge will accumulate and the smaller the opposition to the current.\n\n== Inductive reactance ==\n{{main|Inductance}}\n\nInductive reactance is a property exhibited by an inductor, and inductive reactance exists based on the fact that an electric current produces a magnetic field around it. In the context of an AC circuit (although this concept applies any time current is changing), this magnetic field is constantly changing as a result of current that oscillates back and forth. It is this change in magnetic field that induces another electric current to flow in the same wire (counter-EMF), in a direction such as to oppose the flow of the current originally responsible for producing the magnetic field (known as Lenz's Law). Hence, ''inductive reactance'' is an opposition to the change of current through an element. \n\nFor an ideal inductor in an AC circuit, the inhibitive effect on change in current flow results in a delay, or a phase shift, of the alternating current with respect to alternating voltage. Specifically, an ideal inductor (with no resistance) will cause the current to lag the voltage by a quarter cycle, or 90\u00b0. \n\nIn electric power systems, inductive reactance (and capacitive reactance, however inductive reactance is more common) can limit the power capacity of an AC transmission line, because power is not completely transferred when voltage and current are out-of-phase (detailed above). That is, current will flow for an out-of-phase system, however real power at certain times will not be transferred, because there will be points during which instantaneous current is positive while instantaneous voltage is negative, or vice versa, implying negative power transfer. Hence, real work is not performed when power transfer is \"negative\". However, current still flows even when a system is out-of-phase, which causes transmission lines to heat up due to current flow. Consequently, transmission lines can only heat up so much (or else they would physically sag too much, due to the heat expanding the metal transmission lines), so transmission line operators have a \"ceiling\" on the amount of current that can flow through a given line, and excessive inductive reactance can limit the power capacity of a line. Power providers utilize capacitors to shift the phase and minimize the losses, based on usage patterns.\n\nInductive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the sinusoidal signal [[frequency]] <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> and the [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math>, which depends on the physical shape of the inductor.\n:<math>X_L = \\omega L = 2\\pi f L</math>\n\nThe average current flowing through an [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math> in series with a [[sinusoidal]] AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] <math>\\scriptstyle{A}</math> and frequency <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> is equal to:\n:<math>I_L = {A \\over \\omega L} = {A \\over 2\\pi f L}.</math>\n\nBecause a [[square wave]] has multiple amplitudes at sinusoidal [[harmonic]]s, the average current flowing through an [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math> in series with a square wave AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] <math>\\scriptstyle{A}</math> and frequency <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> is equal to:\n:<math>I_L = {A \\pi^2 \\over 8 \\omega L} = {A\\pi \\over 16 f L}</math>\nmaking it appear as if the inductive reactance to a square wave was about 19% smaller <math>X_L = {16 \\over \\pi} f L</math>  than the reactance to the AC sine wave:\n\nAny conductor of finite dimensions has inductance; the inductance is made larger by the multiple turns in an [[electromagnetic coil]].  [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] of electromagnetic induction gives the counter-[[Electromotive force|emf]] <math>\\scriptstyle{\\mathcal{E}}</math> (voltage opposing current) due to a rate-of-change of [[magnetic flux density]] <math>\\scriptstyle{B}</math> through a current loop.\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = -{{d\\Phi_B} \\over dt}</math>\n\nFor an inductor consisting of a coil with <math>\\scriptstyle N</math> loops this gives.\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = -N{d\\Phi_B \\over dt}</math>\n\nThe counter-emf is the source of the opposition to current flow.  A constant [[direct current]] has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a [[short-circuit]] (it is typically made from a material with a low [[resistivity]]).  An [[alternating current]] has a time-averaged rate-of-change  that is proportional to frequency, this causes the increase in inductive reactance with frequency.\n\n== Impedance ==\n{{main|Electrical impedance}}\nBoth reactance <math>{X}</math> and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] <math>{R}</math> are components of [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] <math>{\\mathbf{Z}}</math>.\n:<math>\\mathbf{Z} = R + \\mathbf{j}X</math>\nwhere:\n*<math>\\mathbf{Z}</math> is the complex [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], measured in [[ohm]]s;\n*<math>R</math> is the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], measured in ohms. It is the real part of the impedance: <math>{R=\\text{Re}{(\\mathbf{Z})}}</math>\n*<math>X</math> is the reactance, measured in ohms. It is the imaginary part of the impedance: <math>{X=\\text{Im}{(\\mathbf{Z})}}</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{j}</math> is the [[square root of minus one]], usually represented by <math>\\mathbf{i}</math> in non-electrical formulas <math>\\mathbf{j}</math> is used so as not to confuse the imaginary unit with current, commonly represented by <math>\\mathbf{i}</math>.\n\nWhen both a capacitor and an inductor are placed in series in a circuit, their contributions to the total circuit impedance are opposite. Capacitive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> and inductive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> contribute to the total reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X}</math> as follows.\n:<math>{X = X_L + X_C = \\omega L -\\frac {1} {\\omega C}}</math>\nwhere:\n*<math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> is the [[Inductance|inductive]] reactance, measured in ohms;\n*<math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> is the [[Capacitance|capacitive]] reactance, measured in ohms;\n*<math>\\omega</math> is the angular frequency, <math>2\\pi</math> times the frequency in Hz.\n\nHence:<ref name=\"Glisson\"/>\n*if <math>\\scriptstyle X > 0</math>, the total reactance is said to be inductive;\n*if <math>\\scriptstyle X = 0</math>, then the impedance is purely resistive;\n*if <math>\\scriptstyle X < 0</math>, the total reactance is said to be capacitive.\n\nNote however that if <math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> are assumed both positive by definition, then the intermediary formula changes to a difference:<ref name=\"Hughes\"/>\n\n:<math>{X = X_L - X_C = \\omega L -\\frac {1} {\\omega C}}</math>\n\nbut the ultimate value is the same.\n\n=== Phase relationship ===\n\nThe phase of the voltage across a purely reactive device (a capacitor with an infinite resistance or an inductor with a resistance of zero) ''lags'' the current by <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> radians for a capacitive reactance and ''leads'' the current by <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> radians for an inductive reactance. Without knowledge of both the resistance and reactance the relationship between voltage and current cannot be determined.\n\nThe origin of the different signs for capacitive and inductive reactance is the phase factor <math>e^{\\pm \\mathbf{j}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}}</math> in the impedance.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{Z}_C &= {1 \\over \\omega C}e^{-\\mathbf{j}{\\pi \\over 2}} = \\mathbf{j}\\left({ -\\frac{1}{\\omega C}}\\right) = \\mathbf{j}X_C \\\\\n  \\mathbf{Z}_L &= \\omega Le^{\\mathbf{j}{\\pi \\over 2}} = \\mathbf{j}\\omega L = \\mathbf{j}X_L\\quad\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor a reactive component the sinusoidal voltage across the component is in quadrature (a <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> phase difference) with the sinusoidal current through the component. The component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit, thus a pure reactance does not dissipate power.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Magnetic reactance]]\n* [[Susceptance]]\n\n== References ==\n# Shamieh C. and McComb G., ''Electronics for Dummies,'' John Wiley & Sons, 2011.\n# Meade R., ''Foundations of Electronics,'' Cengage Learning, 2002.\n# {{cite book | author = Young, Hugh D. |author2=Roger A.

Power providers utilize capacitors to shift the phase and minimize the losses, based on usage patterns.\n\nInductive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the sinusoidal signal [[frequency]] <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> and the [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math>, which depends on the physical shape of the inductor.\n:<math>X_L = \\omega L = 2\\pi f L</math>\n\nThe average current flowing through an [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math> in series with a [[sinusoidal]] AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] <math>\\scriptstyle{A}</math> and frequency <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> is equal to:\n:<math>I_L = {A \\over \\omega L} = {A \\over 2\\pi f L}.</math>\n\nBecause a [[square wave]] has multiple amplitudes at sinusoidal [[harmonic]]s, the average current flowing through an [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math> in series with a square wave AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] <math>\\scriptstyle{A}</math> and frequency <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> is equal to:\n:<math>I_L = {A \\pi^2 \\over 8 \\omega L} = {A\\pi \\over 16 f L}</math>\nmaking it appear as if the inductive reactance to a square wave was about 19% smaller <math>X_L = {16 \\over \\pi} f L</math>  than the reactance to the AC sine wave:\n\nAny conductor of finite dimensions has inductance; the inductance is made larger by the multiple turns in an [[electromagnetic coil]].  [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] of electromagnetic induction gives the counter-[[Electromotive force|emf]] <math>\\scriptstyle{\\mathcal{E}}</math> (voltage opposing current) due to a rate-of-change of [[magnetic flux density]] <math>\\scriptstyle{B}</math> through a current loop.\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = -{{d\\Phi_B} \\over dt}</math>\n\nFor an inductor consisting of a coil with <math>\\scriptstyle N</math> loops this gives.\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = -N{d\\Phi_B \\over dt}</math>\n\nThe counter-emf is the source of the opposition to current flow.  A constant [[direct current]] has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a [[short-circuit]] (it is typically made from a material with a low [[resistivity]]).  An [[alternating current]] has a time-averaged rate-of-change  that is proportional to frequency, this causes the increase in inductive reactance with frequency.\n\n== Impedance ==\n{{main|Electrical impedance}}\nBoth reactance <math>{X}</math> and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] <math>{R}</math> are components of [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] <math>{\\mathbf{Z}}</math>.\n:<math>\\mathbf{Z} = R + \\mathbf{j}X</math>\nwhere:\n*<math>\\mathbf{Z}</math> is the complex [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], measured in [[ohm]]s;\n*<math>R</math> is the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], measured in ohms. It is the real part of the impedance: <math>{R=\\text{Re}{(\\mathbf{Z})}}</math>\n*<math>X</math> is the reactance, measured in ohms. It is the imaginary part of the impedance: <math>{X=\\text{Im}{(\\mathbf{Z})}}</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{j}</math> is the [[square root of minus one]], usually represented by <math>\\mathbf{i}</math> in non-electrical formulas <math>\\mathbf{j}</math> is used so as not to confuse the imaginary unit with current, commonly represented by <math>\\mathbf{i}</math>.\n\nWhen both a capacitor and an inductor are placed in series in a circuit, their contributions to the total circuit impedance are opposite. Capacitive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> and inductive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> contribute to the total reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X}</math> as follows.\n:<math>{X = X_L + X_C = \\omega L -\\frac {1} {\\omega C}}</math>\nwhere:\n*<math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> is the [[Inductance|inductive]] reactance, measured in ohms;\n*<math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> is the [[Capacitance|capacitive]] reactance, measured in ohms;\n*<math>\\omega</math> is the angular frequency, <math>2\\pi</math> times the frequency in Hz.\n\nHence:<ref name=\"Glisson\"/>\n*if <math>\\scriptstyle X > 0</math>, the total reactance is said to be inductive;\n*if <math>\\scriptstyle X = 0</math>, then the impedance is purely resistive;\n*if <math>\\scriptstyle X < 0</math>, the total reactance is said to be capacitive.\n\nNote however that if <math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> are assumed both positive by definition, then the intermediary formula changes to a difference:<ref name=\"Hughes\"/>\n\n:<math>{X = X_L - X_C = \\omega L -\\frac {1} {\\omega C}}</math>\n\nbut the ultimate value is the same.\n\n=== Phase relationship ===\n\nThe phase of the voltage across a purely reactive device (a capacitor with an infinite resistance or an inductor with a resistance of zero) ''lags'' the current by <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> radians for a capacitive reactance and ''leads'' the current by <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> radians for an inductive reactance. Without knowledge of both the resistance and reactance the relationship between voltage and current cannot be determined.\n\nThe origin of the different signs for capacitive and inductive reactance is the phase factor <math>e^{\\pm \\mathbf{j}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}}</math> in the impedance.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{Z}_C &= {1 \\over \\omega C}e^{-\\mathbf{j}{\\pi \\over 2}} = \\mathbf{j}\\left({ -\\frac{1}{\\omega C}}\\right) = \\mathbf{j}X_C \\\\\n  \\mathbf{Z}_L &= \\omega Le^{\\mathbf{j}{\\pi \\over 2}} = \\mathbf{j}\\omega L = \\mathbf{j}X_L\\quad\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor a reactive component the sinusoidal voltage across the component is in quadrature (a <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> phase difference) with the sinusoidal current through the component. The component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit, thus a pure reactance does not dissipate power.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Magnetic reactance]]\n* [[Susceptance]]\n\n== References ==\n# Shamieh C. and McComb G., ''Electronics for Dummies,'' John Wiley & Sons, 2011.\n# Meade R., ''Foundations of Electronics,'' Cengage Learning, 2002.\n# {{cite book | author = Young, Hugh D. |author2=Roger A.

Although the episode number count continues to increment with these episodes, they are not officially part of any season, unlike in 2017 when the Summer episodes were considered part of Season 11. Thus, this serves as an in-between series until Season 14 premieres on August 20, 2018.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBPdKxlazD0&t=21s</ref> Additionally, these Summer episodes revert to the original format of one segment plus the accompanying ''Good Mythical More'', rather than the four and three segment format used for the past two seasons (12 and 13, respectively).\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Guest(s)\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Release date\n|-\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list\n | EpisodeNumber = 1333\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n | Title =Will It Slip-N-Slide?

This season also added an additional week of episodes (or additional 5 episodes) after their original season finale episode to reminisce fan favorite moments of GMM in 2018.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MxgJS3LBrw&t=19s</ref> As these additional shows continue to increment the overall number of episodes and still part of Season 14, the date of the season finale listed in the ''Overview'' section above this page will be the publish date of the last additional episode, not the original date, in order to avoid confusion.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Guest(s)\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Release date\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list\n | EpisodeNumber = 1360\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n | Title = WILL IT NACHO?

This season also added an additional week of episodes (or additional 5 episodes) after their original season finale episode to reminisce fan favorite moments of GMM in 2019. Unlike last year, the additional videos don't increment the overall number of episodes but is still part of Season 16. Thus, those episodes will not count.

Although the episode number count continues to increment with these episodes, they are not officially part of any season, unlike in 2017 when the Summer episodes were considered part of Season 11. Thus, this serves as an in-between series until Season 14 premieres on August 20, 2018.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBPdKxlazD0&t=21s</ref> Additionally, these Summer episodes revert to the original format of one segment plus the accompanying ''Good Mythical More'', rather than the four and three segment format used for the past two seasons (12 and 13, respectively).\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Guest(s)\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Release date\n|-\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list\n | EpisodeNumber = 1333\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n | Title =Will It Slip-N-Slide?

This season also added an additional week of episodes (or additional 5 episodes) after their original season finale episode to reminisce fan favorite moments of GMM in 2018.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MxgJS3LBrw&t=19s</ref> As these additional shows continue to increment the overall number of episodes and still part of Season 14, the date of the season finale listed in the ''Overview'' section above this page will be the publish date of the last additional episode, not the original date, in order to avoid confusion.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Guest(s)\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Release date\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list\n | EpisodeNumber = 1360\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n | Title = WILL IT NACHO?

This season also added an additional week of episodes (or additional 5 episodes) after their original season finale episode to reminisce fan favorite moments of GMM in 2019. Unlike last year, the additional videos don't increment the overall number of episodes but is still part of Season 16. Thus, those episodes will not count.

Roosevelt]]'s election to an unprecedented four terms as president, the notion of presidential [[term limit]]s has long been debated in American politics. Delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention of 1787]] considered the issue extensively (alongside broader questions, such as who would elect the president, and the president's role). Many\u2014including [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]]\u2014supported a lifetime appointment for presidents, while others favored fixed terms appointments. Virginia's [[George Mason]] denounced the life-tenure proposal as tantamount to establishment of an [[elective monarchy]].<ref name=BuckleyMetzger>{{cite web| title=Twenty-second Amendment| last1=Buckley| first1=F.

X, section 1.</ref>  Ultimately, the Framers approved four-year terms with no restriction on the amount of time a person could serve as president.\n\nThough dismissed by the Constitutional Convention, the concept of term limits for U.S. presidents took hold during the presidencies of [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. As his second term entered its final year in 1796, George Washington was exhausted from years of public service, and his health had begun to decline. He was also bothered by the unrelenting attacks from his political opponents, which had escalated after the signing of the [[Jay Treaty]], and believed that he had accomplished his major goals as president. For these reasons, he decided not to stand for reelection to a third term, a decision he announced to the nation through a ''[[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]]'' in September 1796.<ref>{{cite book| last=Ferling| first=John| authorlink=John E.

Following [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s reelection victory in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], there were serious discussions within Republican political circles about the possibility of his running again in 1876. Interest in a third term for Grant evaporated however, in the light of negative public opinion and opposition from members of Congress, and Grant left the presidency in 1877, after two terms. Even so, as the 1880 election approached, he sought nomination for a (non-consecutive) third term at the [[1880 Republican National Convention]], but narrowly lost to [[James Garfield]], who would go on to win the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 election]].<ref name=PeabodyGant/>\n\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] succeeded to the presidency on September 14, 1901, following [[Assassination of William McKinley|William McKinley's assassination]] ({{age in days|Mar 4 1901|Sep 14 1901}} days into his second term), and was subsequently elected to a full term in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]]. While he declined to seek a third (second full) term in 1908, Roosevelt did seek one four years later, in the [[1912 United States presidential election|election of 1912]], where he lost to [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Wilson himself, despite his ill health following a serious stroke, aspired to a third term. Many of Wilson's advisers tried to convince him that his health precluded another campaign, but Wilson nonetheless asked that his name be placed in nomination for the presidency at the [[1920 Democratic National Convention]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Year of the Six Presidents |last=Pietrusza |first=David |publisher=Carroll and Graf |location=New York |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-78671-622-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780786716227/page/187 187\u2013200] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780786716227/page/187 }}</ref> Democratic Party leaders were unwilling to support Wilson, however, and the nomination eventually went to [[James M.

His Vice President, [[John Nance Garner]], along with [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[James Farley]], announced their candidacies for the Democratic nomination. When the convention came, Roosevelt sent a message to the convention, saying he would run only if [[Draft (politics)|drafted]], saying delegates were free to vote for whomever they pleased.

Near the end of the campaign, Thomas Dewey announced his support of a constitutional amendment that would limit future presidents to two terms.

As many of them had campaigned on the issue of presidential tenure, declaring their support for a constitutional amendment that would limit how long a person could serve as president, the issue was given top priority in the [[80th Congress]] when it convened in January 1947.<ref name=Peabody22A/>\n\n==Proposal and ratification==\n===Proposal in Congress===\n{{see also|Presidency of Harry S.

Introduced by [[Earl C. Michener]], the measure passed 285\u2013121, with support from 47 Democrats, on February 6, 1947. Meanwhile, the Senate developed its own proposed amendment, which initially differed from the House proposal by requiring that the amendment be submitted to [[state ratifying conventions]] for ratification, rather than to the state legislatures, and by prohibiting any person who had served more than 365 days in each of two terms from further presidential service. Both these provisions were removed when the full Senate took up the bill, but a new provision was, however, added. Put forward by [[Robert A.

In the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]] and the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 presidential election]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] became the first president to win a third term and then later a fourth term, giving rise to concerns about the potential issues involved with a president serving an unlimited number of terms. [[United States Congress|Congress]] approved the Twenty-second Amendment on March 24, 1947, afhaljhfhnd submitted it to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification|ratification]]. That process was completed on February 27, 1951, after the amendment had been ratified by the requisite 36 of the then-48 [[U.S. state|states]] (as neither [[Alaska]] nor [[Hawaii]] had been [[Admission to the Union|admitted as states]]), and its provisions [[Coming into force|came into force]] on that date.\n\nThe amendment prohibits any individual who has been elected president twice from being elected again. Under the amendment, an individual who fills an unexpired presidential term lasting greater than two years is also prohibited from winning election as president more than once.

Roosevelt]]'s election to an unprecedented four terms as president, the notion of presidential [[term limit]]s has long been debated in American politics. Delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention of 1787]] considered the issue extensively (alongside broader questions, such as who would elect the president, and the president's role). Many\u2014including [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]]\u2014supported a lifetime appointment for presidents, while others favored fixed terms appointments. Virginia's [[George Mason]] denounced the life-tenure proposal as tantamount to establishment of an [[elective monarchy]].<ref name=BuckleyMetzger>{{cite web| title=Twenty-second Amendment| last1=Buckley| first1=F.

As his second term entered its final year in 1796, George Washington was exhausted from years of public service, and his health had begun to decline. He was also bothered by the unrelenting attacks from his political opponents, which had escalated after the signing of the [[Jay Treaty]], and believed that he had accomplished his major goals as president. For these reasons, he decided not to stand for reelection to a third term, a decision he announced to the nation through a ''[[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]]'' in September 1796.<ref>{{cite book| last=Ferling| first=John| authorlink=John E.

Following [[Ulysses S.

Even so, as the 1880 election approached, he sought nomination for a (non-consecutive) third term at the [[1880 Republican National Convention]], but narrowly lost to [[James Garfield]], who would go on to win the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 election]].<ref name=PeabodyGant/>\n\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] succeeded to the presidency on September 14, 1901, following [[Assassination of William McKinley|William McKinley's assassination]] ({{age in days|Mar 4 1901|Sep 14 1901}} days into his second term), and was subsequently elected to a full term in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]]. While he declined to seek a third (second full) term in 1908, Roosevelt did seek one four years later, in the [[1912 United States presidential election|election of 1912]], where he lost to [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Wilson himself, despite his ill health following a serious stroke, aspired to a third term.

As many of them had campaigned on the issue of presidential tenure, declaring their support for a constitutional amendment that would limit how long a person could serve as president, the issue was given top priority in the [[80th Congress]] when it convened in January 1947.<ref name=Peabody22A/>\n\n==Proposal and ratification==\n===Proposal in Congress===\n{{see also|Presidency of Harry S.

Introduced by [[Earl C. Michener]], the measure passed 285\u2013121, with support from 47 Democrats, on February 6, 1947. Meanwhile, the Senate developed its own proposed amendment, which initially differed from the House proposal by requiring that the amendment be submitted to [[state ratifying conventions]] for ratification, rather than to the state legislatures, and by prohibiting any person who had served more than 365 days in each of two terms from further presidential service. Both these provisions were removed when the full Senate took up the bill, but a new provision was, however, added. Put forward by [[Robert A. Taft]], it clarified procedures governing the number of times a vice president who succeeded to the presidency might be elected to office.

Due to this, several issues could be raised regarding the amendment's meaning and application, especially in relation to the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]], ratified in 1804, which states, \"But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States\".<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/amendments-11-27| title=The Constitution: Amendments 11-27| work=America's Founding Documents| publisher=National Archives| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=March 11, 2018}}</ref> While it is clear that under the 12th Amendment the original constitutional qualifications of age, citizenship, and residency apply to both the president and vice president, it is unclear whether someone who is ineligible to be elected president could be elected vice president. Because of this apparent ambiguity, there may be a loophole in the 22nd Amendment whereby a two-term former president could be elected vice president and then succeed to the presidency as a result of the incumbent's death, resignation, or removal from office (or even succeed to the presidency from some other stated office in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]]).<ref name=PeabodyGant/><ref>{{cite web| url=https://cornerstonelaw.us/22nd-amendment-doesnt-say-think-says/| title=The 22nd Amendment Doesn't Say What You Think It Says | publisher=Cornerstone Law Firm| location=Blandon, Pennsylvania| last=Ready| first=Joel A. |accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome argue that the 22nd Amendment and 12th Amendment bar any two-term president from later serving as vice president as well as from succeeding to the presidency from any point in the presidential line of succession.<ref>{{cite web| title=Constitutional Sleight of Hand| last=Franck| first=Matthew J.| date=July 31, 2007| accessdate=June 12, 2008| work=[[National Review]]|url=http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDgwODVmMzcwMTQwNDM3YjU0OGE5ZjQyOTIxNmUyYzY=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613214946/http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDgwODVmMzcwMTQwNDM3YjU0OGE5ZjQyOTIxNmUyYzY=|archivedate=June 13, 2008}}</ref> Others contend that the [[original intent]] of the 12th Amendment concerns qualification for ''service'' (age, residence, and citizenship), while the 22nd Amendment, concerns qualifications for ''election'', and thus ([[Strict constructionism|strictly applying the text]]) a former two-term president is still eligible to ''serve'' as vice president (neither amendment restricts the number of times an individual can be elected to the vice presidency), and then succeed to the presidency to serve out the balance of the term (though prohibited from running for election to an additional term).<ref>{{cite news |title=Why the Constitution permits a Gore-Clinton ticket |authorlink=Michael C.

One plausible theory is that the word \"Tehran\" is derived from Tiran/Tirgan, \"The Abode of Tir\" (Tir being the Zoroastrian deity equivalent to the Greek deity Mercury). The ancient Parthian town of Tiran was a neighbour to the town of Mehran (\"The Abode of Mehr/Mithra\", the Zoroastrian sun god). Both of these were mere villages in the suburbs of the great city of Ray/Rhages. Mehran is still extant and forms a residential district inside the Greater Tehran, as is also Ray\u2014which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran.\nAnother theory is that Tehran means \"a warm place\", as opposed to \"a cool place\" (e.g. Shemiran)\u2014a cooler district in northern Tehran. Some current texts in this regard claim that the word Tehran in Persian means \"warm mountain slope\" (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0631\u0645).\nThe official City of Tehran website says that \"Tehran\" comes from the Persian words \"Tah\" meaning \"end or bottom\" and \"Ran\" meaning \"[mountain] slope\"\u2014literally, bottom of the mountain slope. Given Tehran's geographic position at the bottom of the slope of the Alborz Mountains, this appears to be the most plausible explanation of the origin of the name of the city (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0648 \u06a9\u0648\u0647).<ref>{{Cite web |author=Behrooz, Samira; Karampour, Katayoun. |url=http://universityandheritage.net/SIFU/XII_Hanoi_2009/en/abstracts/html/14.html |title=A Research on Adaptation of Historic Urban Landscapes |date=November 15, 2008}}</ref> \n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Timeline of Tehran}}\n\nThe settlement of Tehran dates back over 7,000 years.<ref>{{Cite new |publisher=[[Press TV]] |url=http://presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |title=7,000-year-old human skeleton recovered in south Tehran |date=January 14, 2015 |access-date=November 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016094735/http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Classical era ===\nTehran is situated within the historical region of [[Media (region)|Media]] ({{lang-peo|\ud800\udfb6\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfad}} {{transl|peo|M\u0101da}}) in northwestern Iran.

On June 2, 1907, the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the ''Baladie'' ([[municipal law]]), providing a detailed outline on issues such as the role of councils within the city, the members' qualifications, the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote. The then Qajar monarch [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad Ali Shah]] abolished the constitution and [[1908 bombardment of the Majlis|bombarded]] the parliament with the help of the Russian-controlled [[Persian Cossack Brigade|Cossack Brigade]] on June 23, 1908.

That followed a systematic demolition of several old buildings, including parts of the [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tekyeh Dowlat|Tekye Dowlat]], and [[Toopkhaneh|Tupkhane Square]], which were replaced with modern buildings influenced by classical Iranian architecture, particularly the building of the [[Bank Melli Iran|National Bank]], the Police Headquarters, the Telegraph Office, and the Military Academy.\n\nThe changes in urban fabric started with the street-widening act of 1933, which served as a framework for changes in all other cities.

These plans not only failed to slow the unbalanced growth of Tehran, but with the 1962 land reforms that Reza Shah's son and successor [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah]] named the ''[[White Revolution]]'', Tehran's chaotic growth was further accentuated.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Tehran was rapidly developing under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah. Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran and ambitious projects were envisioned for the following decades. In order to resolve the problem of [[social exclusion]], the first comprehensive plan of Tehran was approved in 1968. The consortium of Iranian architect [[Abdol-Aziz Mirza Farmanfarmaian|Abd-ol-Aziz Farmanfarmaian]] and the American firm of [[Victor Gruen|Victor Gruen Associates]] identified the main problems blighting the city to be high-density suburbs, air and water pollution, inefficient infrastructure, unemployment, and rural-urban migration.

After the political, social, and economic consequences of the [[1979 Revolution]] and the years that followed, a number of Iranian citizens, mostly Tehranis, left Iran. The majority of [[Iranian diaspora|Iranian emigrations]] have left for the [[Iranian Americans|United States]], [[Iranians in Germany|Germany]], [[Swedish Iranians|Sweden]], and [[Iranian Canadians|Canada]].\n\nWith the start of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u20131988), the second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during the Iraqi air offensives on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at the time, economic isolation gave yet more reason for many inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and have struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering [[Iraq]].\n\nThe unstable situation and the war in neighbouring [[Afghanistan]] and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the country who arrived in their millions, with Tehran being a magnet for much seeking work, who subsequently helped the city to recover from war wounds, working for far less pay than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their own countries. Afghan refugees are mostly [[Dari language|Dari]]-speaking [[Tajiks|Tajik]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]], speaking a variety of Persian, and Iraqi refugees are mainly [[Mesopotamian Arabic]]-speakers who are often of Iranian heritage.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{See also|Religion in Iran}}\nThe majority of Tehranis are officially [[Twelver Shia]] [[Islam|Muslims]], which has also been the state religion since the 16th-century [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Safavid conversion]]. Other religious communities in the city include followers of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Sufism|Mystic]] branches of Islam, various [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations, [[Judaism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]].\n\nThere are many religious centres scattered around the city, from old to newly built centres, including [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Mosques and madrasehs|mosques]], [[List of religious centres in Tehran#Churches|churches]], [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Synagogues|synagogues]], and [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Fire temples|Zoroastrian fire temples]].

One plausible theory is that the word \"Tehran\" is derived from Tiran/Tirgan, \"The Abode of Tir\" (Tir being the Zoroastrian deity equivalent to the Greek deity Hermes or the Roman Deity Mercury). The ancient Parthian town of Tiran was a neighbour to the town of Mehran (\"The Abode of Mehr/Mithra\", the Zoroastrian sun god). Both of these were mere villages in the suburbs of the great city of Ray/Rhages. Mehran is still extant and forms a residential district inside the Greater Tehran, as is also Ray\u2014which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran.\nAnother theory is that Tehran means \"a warm place\", as opposed to \"a cool place\" (e.g. Shemiran)\u2014a cooler district in northern Tehran. Some current texts in this regard claim that the word Tehran in Persian means \"warm mountain slope\" (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0631\u0645).\nThe official City of Tehran website says that \"Tehran\" comes from the Persian words \"Tah\" meaning \"end or bottom\" and \"Ran\" meaning \"[mountain] slope\"\u2014literally, bottom of the mountain slope. Given Tehran's geographic position at the bottom of the slope of the Alborz Mountains, this appears to be the most plausible explanation of the origin of the name of the city (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0648 \u06a9\u0648\u0647).<ref>{{Cite web |author=Behrooz, Samira; Karampour, Katayoun. |url=http://universityandheritage.net/SIFU/XII_Hanoi_2009/en/abstracts/html/14.html |title=A Research on Adaptation of Historic Urban Landscapes |date=November 15, 2008}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Timeline of Tehran}}\n\nThe settlement of Tehran dates back over 7,000 years.<ref>{{Cite new |publisher=[[Press TV]] |url=http://presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |title=7,000-year-old human skeleton recovered in south Tehran |date=January 14, 2015 |access-date=November 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016094735/http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Classical era ===\nTehran is situated within the historical region of [[Media (region)|Media]] ({{lang-peo|\ud800\udfb6\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfad}} {{transl|peo|M\u0101da}}) in northwestern Iran.

On June 2, 1907, the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the ''Baladie'' ([[municipal law]]), providing a detailed outline on issues such as the role of councils within the city, the members' qualifications, the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote. The then Qajar monarch [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad Ali Shah]] abolished the constitution and [[1908 bombardment of the Majlis|bombarded]] the parliament with the help of the Russian-controlled [[Persian Cossack Brigade|Cossack Brigade]] on June 23, 1908. That followed the capture of the city by the revolutionary forces of [[Ali-Qoli Khan Bakhtiari|Ali-Qoli Khan]] (Sardar Asad II) and [[Mohammad Vali Khan Tonekaboni|Mohammad Vali Khan]] (Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni) on July 13, 1909. As a result, the monarch was exiled and replaced with his son [[Ahmad Shah Qajar|Ahmad]], and the parliament was re-established.\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Teheran aus 400 m H\u00f6he-Persienflug 1924-1925-LBS MH02-02-0085-AL-FL.tif|250px|thumb|Aerial view of Tehran in 1925]]\nAfter [[World War I]], the constituent assembly elected [[Reza Shah]] of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] as the new monarch, who immediately suspended the Baladie law of 1907, replacing the decentralized and autonomous city councils with centralist approaches of governance and planning.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1930s, under the rule of Reza Shah, the city was essentially rebuilt from scratch. That followed a systematic demolition of several old buildings, including parts of the [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tekyeh Dowlat|Tekye Dowlat]], and [[Toopkhaneh|Tupkhane Square]], which were replaced with modern buildings influenced by classical Iranian architecture, particularly the building of the [[Bank Melli Iran|National Bank]], the Police Headquarters, the Telegraph Office, and the Military Academy.\n\nThe changes in urban fabric started with the street-widening act of 1933, which served as a framework for changes in all other cities. The [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|Grand Bazaar]] was divided in half and many historic buildings were demolished to be replaced with wide straight avenues.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chaichian|first1=Mohammad|title=Town and Country in the Middle East: Iran and Egypt in the Transition to Globalization|date=2009|publisher=Lexington Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7391-2677-6|pages=95\u2013116}}</ref> As a result, the traditional texture of the city was replaced with intersecting cruciform streets that created large roundabouts, located on major public spaces such as the bazaar.\n\nAs an attempt to create a network for easy transportation within the city, the old citadel and city walls were demolished in 1937, replaced by wide streets cutting through the urban fabric. The new city map of Tehran in 1937 was heavily influenced by modernist planning patterns of zoning and gridiron networks.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] troops entered the city. In 1943, Tehran was the site of the [[Tehran Conference]], attended by U.S. President [[Franklin D.

These plans not only failed to slow the unbalanced growth of Tehran, but with the 1962 land reforms that Reza Shah's son and successor [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah]] named the ''[[White Revolution]]'', Tehran's chaotic growth was further accentuated.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Tehran was rapidly developing under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah. Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran and ambitious projects were envisioned for the following decades. In order to resolve the problem of [[social exclusion]], the first comprehensive plan of Tehran was approved in 1968. The consortium of Iranian architect [[Abdol-Aziz Mirza Farmanfarmaian|Abd-ol-Aziz Farmanfarmaian]] and the American firm of [[Victor Gruen|Victor Gruen Associates]] identified the main problems blighting the city to be high-density suburbs, air and water pollution, inefficient infrastructure, unemployment, and rural-urban migration. Eventually, the whole plan was marginalized by the [[1979 Revolution]] and the subsequent [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n[[File:AJM3299.jpg|thumb|The [[Azadi Tower]] was built in 1971.]]\nTehran's most famous landmark, the [[Azadi Tower]], was built by the order of the Shah in 1971. It was designed by [[Hossein Amanat]], an architect who won a competition to design the monument, combining elements of classical [[Sasanian architecture|Sassanian architecture]] with post-classical Iranian architecture. Formerly known as the ''Shahyad Tower'', it was built in commemoration of the [[2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire|2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran]].\n\nDuring the 1980\u20131988 Iran\u2013Iraq War, Tehran was the target of repeated [[Scud]] missile attacks and airstrikes.\n\nThe 435-meter-high [[Milad Tower]], which was part of the proposed development projects in pre-revolutionary Iran,<ref name=SadCity>{{cite web|last=Vanstiphout|first=Wouter|title=The Saddest City in the World|url=http://www.thenewtown.nl/article.php?id_article=71|work=The New Town|accessdate=1 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219102023/http://www.thenewtown.nl/article.php?id_article=71|archivedate=19 December 2013}}</ref> was completed in 2007, and has thence become a famous landmark of Tehran.

Tehran's climate is largely defined by its geographic location, with the towering [[Alborz]] mountains to its north and the country's central desert to the south. It can be generally described as mild in spring and autumn, hot and dry in summer, and cold and wet in winter.\n\n[[File:A fall in Nation Park, Tehran City.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Mellat Park]] in autumn.]]\nAs the city has a large area, with significant differences in elevation among various districts, the weather is often cooler in the hilly north than in the flat southern part of Tehran.

After the political, social, and economic consequences of the [[1979 Revolution]] and the years that followed, a number of Iranian citizens, mostly Tehranis, left Iran. The majority of [[Iranian diaspora|Iranian emigrations]] have left for the [[Iranian Americans|United States]], [[Iranians in Germany|Germany]], [[Swedish Iranians|Sweden]], and [[Iranian Canadians|Canada]].\n\nWith the start of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u20131988), the second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during the Iraqi air offensives on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at the time, economic isolation gave yet more reason for many inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and have struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering [[Iraq]].\n\nThe unstable situation and the war in neighbouring [[Afghanistan]] and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the country who arrived in their millions, with Tehran being a magnet for much seeking work, who subsequently helped the city to recover from war wounds, working for far less pay than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their own countries.
