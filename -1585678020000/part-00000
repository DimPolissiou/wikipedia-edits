[[A.S. Roma]] successfully bid \u00a315,000 for him, a large sum in those days, but foreign exchange regulations stopped the transfer.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>  After the war Everton transferred [[Tommy Lawton]] to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Joe Mercer]] to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. These deals were not only blows to the Everton team, but to him personally, he had been [[best man]] at Joe Mercer's wedding.\n\nA club director falsely accused Jones of feigning injury in a wartime match and his senior appearances thereafter were sporadic. Jones's injury was actually severe enough to put him in hospital for four months. Once the relations with the manager [[Cliff Britton]] became so bad that he was even not picked for the reserve team, and played secretly for Hawarden Grammar Old Boys.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Jones became club captain in 1949 but after falling out of favour, in January 1950, he accepted an offer to leave Everton for [[Pwllheli F.C.|Pwllheli]]. In all he  made 178 peacetime appearances for Everton, scoring five goals.\n\nJones won 17 caps for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and eleven caps in wartime internationals.\n\nAfter Jones left Everton he played non league football for [[Pwllheli F.C.|Pwllheli]] and became their part-time manager, as well as running a hotel in the town.<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> In 1957 he became manager of [[Bangor City]]. In 1962, after winning the [[Welsh Cup]], the team beat [[Napoli]] 2\u20130 in the home leg in the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] but lost 1\u20133 in Italy. With no away-goal rule, Bangor lost the replay 3\u20131. He ended his managerial career at Rhyl followed by a brief stint as advisor to Bethesda. In later life Jones ran a [[newsagent's shop]] in north Wales.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\nHe was elected a 'Millennium Giant' by Everton in 2000, one of the first eleven from the club's long history to be so honoured. The panel of assessors described him as an apparently effortless, skilful and assured footballer.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/thomas-george-jones.html\n|title=Everton FC obituary\n|accessdate= 14 October 2008\n}}\n</ref> He passed the ball from his position at centre-half in the same way that [[Franz Beckenbauer]] would do later. He was renowned for his sporting behaviour. [[Stanley Matthews]], [[Tommy Lawton]],  [[Joe Mercer]] and [[Dixie Dean]] each cited Jones as the greatest player that they ever saw.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/><ref name=\"Independent\"/> Former Liverpool star of the same era, [[Cyril Done]], said that \"T. G. was a gentleman off the field, and a gentleman on the field\".\n\nIn addition to his playing career, Tommy was instrumental in re-establishing senior football in his home town after the collapse of Connah's Quay and Shotton United in 1927, just six months after they had won the Welsh Cup and beating the previous season's FA Cup winners Cardiff City in the final. Though junior clubs, notable Connah's Quay Albion played in the town it was not until Tommy's intervention in July 1946 that [[Gap Connah's Quay F.C.|Connah's Quay Juniors]], the fore-runner of the present-day Nomads club was formed. Attracted by the reputation of the famous international, youngsters from Connah's Quay and its surrounding towns and villages flocked to join the new team which quickly became a major force in North Wales youth soccer, winning the Welsh Youth Cup in 1948. By natural progression a senior team was formed and joined the Flintshire League in 1948. Success soon followed and Connah's Quay Juniors reached the final of the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1950/51. Prior to the 1952/53 season, the suffix Nomads was adopted and the team ventured into the Welsh League (North).\n\n==Personal life==\nHis wife Joyce died in 2003.

He signed for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for \u00a33,000 in 1936.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/players/t/tj/tg-jones|title=Tommy 'TG' Jones {{!}} Everton Football Club|website=www.evertonfc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>  He won a [[Football League First Division]] champions medal in only his second full season at Everton in [[1938-39 in English football|1938-39]], before his career was interrupted by the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Jones served as a sergeant PT Instructor in the RAF during the war, but he resumed his career for Everton in 1946. [[A.S. Roma]] successfully bid \u00a315,000 for him, a large sum in those days, but foreign exchange regulations stopped the transfer.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>  After the war Everton transferred [[Tommy Lawton]] to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Joe Mercer]] to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].  These deals were not only blows to the Everton team, but to him personally, he had been [[best man]] at Joe Mercer's wedding.\n\nA club director falsely accused Jones of feigning injury in a wartime match and his senior appearances thereafter were sporadic. Jones's injury was actually severe enough to put him in hospital for four months. Once the relations with the manager [[Cliff Britton]] became so bad that he was even not picked for the reserve team, and played secretly for Hawarden Grammar Old Boys.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Jones became club captain in 1949 but after falling out of favour, in January 1950, he accepted an offer to leave Everton for [[Pwllheli F.C.|Pwllheli]]. In all he  made 178 peacetime appearances for Everton, scoring five goals.\n\nJones won 17 caps for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and eleven caps in wartime internationals.\n\nAfter Jones left Everton he played non league football for [[Pwllheli F.C.|Pwllheli]] and became their part-time manager, as well as running a hotel in the town.<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> In 1957 he became manager of [[Bangor City]].  In 1962, after winning the [[Welsh Cup]], the team beat [[Napoli]] 2-0 in the home leg in the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] but lost 1-3 in [[Italy]]. With no away-goal rule, Bangor lost the replay 3-1. He ended his managerial career at Rhyl followed by a brief stint as advisor to Bethesda. In later life Jones ran a [[newsagent's shop]] in north Wales.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\nHe was elected a 'Millennium Giant' by Everton in 2000, one of the first eleven from the club's long history to be so honoured. The panel of assessors described him as an apparently effortless, skilful and assured footballer.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/thomas-george-jones.html\n|title=Everton FC obituary\n|accessdate= 14 October 2008\n}}\n</ref> He passed the ball from his position at centre-half in the same way that [[Franz Beckenbauer]] would do later. He was renowned for his sporting behaviour. [[Stanley Matthews]], [[Tommy Lawton]],  [[Joe Mercer]] and [[Dixie Dean]] each cited Jones as the greatest player that they ever saw.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/><ref name=\"Independent\"/> Former Liverpool star of the same era, [[Cyril Done]], said that \"T. G. was a gentleman off the field, and a gentleman on the field\".\n\nIn addition to his playing career, Tommy was instrumental in re-establishing senior football in his home town after the collapse of Connah's Quay and Shotton United in 1927, just six months after they had won the Welsh Cup and beating the previous season's FA Cup winners Cardiff City in the final. Though junior clubs, notable Connah's Quay Albion played in the town it was not until Tommy's intervention in July 1946 that [[Gap Connah's Quay F.C.|Connah\u2019s Quay Juniors]], the fore-runner of the present-day Nomads club was formed. Attracted by the reputation of the famous international, youngsters from Connah's Quay and its surrounding towns and villages flocked to join the new team which quickly became a major force in North Wales youth soccer, winning the Welsh Youth Cup in 1948. By natural progression a senior team was formed and joined the Flintshire League in 1948. Success soon followed and Connah\u2019s Quay Juniors reached the final of the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1950/51. Prior to the 1952/53 season, the suffix Nomads was adopted and the team ventured into the Welsh League (North).\n\n==Personal life==\nHis wife Joyce died in 2003.

{"title_page": "Humanitarian engineering", "text_new": "'''Humanitarian Engineering''' is the application of engineering for humanitarian aid purposes. As a meta-discipline of engineering, Humanitarian Engineering combines multiple engineering disciplines in order to address many of the world's crises and humanitarian emergencies, especially to improve the well-being of marginalized populations. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Ryan|last2=Wilson|first2=Denise|date=2011-06-01|title=The Unique Value of Humanitarian Engineering|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257410686_The_Unique_Value_of_Humanitarian_Engineering|pages=1\u201311}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nEncyclopedia Brittanica defines Humanitarian engineering as:<blockquote>'''Humanitarian engineering''', the application of engineering to improving the well-being of marginalized people and disadvantaged communities, usually in the developing world. Humanitarian engineering typically focuses on programs that are affordable, sustainable, and based on local resources. Projects are typically community-driven and cross-disciplinary, and they focus on finding simple solutions to basic needs (such as close access to clean water; adequate heat, shelter, and sanitation; and reliable pathways to markets). <ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1007035768|title=ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA : microscope.|last=BRITTANICA, ENCYCLOPEDIA.|date=2016|publisher=HANSEBOOKS|isbn=3742823515|oclc=1007035768}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== History ==\nThe existence of the phrase \"humanitarian engineering\" has only been somewhat commonplace since the early 2000s. In fact, the usage of the phrase \"humanitarian engineering\" practically does not exist in any professional literature from the 1800s to the year 2000. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=humanitarian+engineering&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=0&share=&direct_url=|title=Google Ngram Viewer|website=books.google.com|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the concept of utilizing engineering as a mechanism of promoting societal welfare has been something that has existed since the early days of the discipline. <ref>{{Citation|title=Engineering ethics|date=2019-09-19|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engineering_ethics&oldid=916638944|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> It was something that evolved out of the creation of an engineering code of ethics as well as the acceptance of a widespread engineering ethics as a whole. While initially, the notion of ethics was something meant to be a personal decision, over time, a general framework of what an engineer ought to do became established. The creation of organizations such as the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] furthered this trend, as many such organizations began to adopt codes of ethics specifically meant to create a ethics framework for engineers. Within these codes of ethics, obligations that engineers have to society were explicitly stated including ideas like: \"Engineers shall at all times strive to serve the public interest.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|title=Code of Ethics {{!}} National Society of Professional Engineers|website=www.nspe.org|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> This evolved into the creation of humanitarian engineering projects meant to promote such societal welfare. As a result, in the early days of the discipline, humanitarian engineering was really only an application of engineering ethics as well as something that was just a part of individual engineering disciplines.\n\nAs a discipline of study, though, it was around 2003, when the Colorado School of Mines created the first humanitarian engineering minor, that humanitarian engineering truly gained more recognition. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://humanitarian.mines.edu/|title=Humanitarian Engineering|website=Humanitarian Engineering|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> Over time, as more and more universities have created programs explicitly for humanitarian engineering, it has grown more as a standalone discipline, rather than just an implicit part of general engineering discipline. \u00a0\n\n== Relationships with other disciplines ==\nMost engineering disciplines have a code of ethics that encourage working to improve the general welfare. For example: The Institute of Civil Engineers actively encourages the utilization of civil engineering in humanitarian work, calling it the \"highest calling\" of the occupation. Active work in the field ranges from an understanding and safety in humanitarian projects, to case studies on road building, refugee camps, footbridges, disaster response, housing and environmental clean-up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.org.uk/news-and-insight/the-civil-engineer/may-2016/humanitarian-engineering|title=Humanitarian engineering: as good as it gets|date=2016-04-05|website=Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE)|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> Likewise, organizations for other disciplines such as Chemical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering also encourage applying their respective disciplines for humanitarian engineering. This is coupled with the fact that many organizations, especially universities, conduct humanitarian engineering products utilizing skills from specific disciplines. \u00a0<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ewb.berkeley.edu/projects/peru/|title=PERU PROJECT \u2013 Engineers Without Borders|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\n== Notable projects ==\n\n=== The Peru Project ===\nThe Peru Project originated at UC Berkeley's chapter of Engineer's Without Borders, and its goal was to introduce safe water sources to communities affected by groundwater wells that contained high levels of arsenic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ewb.berkeley.edu/projects/|title=PROJECTS \u2013 Engineers Without Borders|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> The engineers built rainwater catchment systems in schools which utilized roof gutters to collect rainwater, a flush system to filter debris from the gutters, and a tank to collect the water.

After overcoming various setbacks, the engineers managed to complete the project with assistance from the village residents. The result of this project was a 30,000-liter tank and 6,000 meters of pipe that helped distribute this water within a two-kilometer radius.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/magazine/humanitarian-engineering|title=Humanitarian Engineering {{!}} Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth|website=engineering.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\n== Training and education ==\nAn education in humanitarian engineering incorporates history, politics, economics, sociology, language, as well as rigorous engineering basics.

As a meta-discipline of engineering, Humanitarian Engineering combines multiple engineering disciplines in order to address many of the world's crises and humanitarian emergencies, especially to improve the well-being of marginalized populations. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Ryan|last2=Wilson|first2=Denise|date=2011-06-01|title=The Unique Value of Humanitarian Engineering|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257410686_The_Unique_Value_of_Humanitarian_Engineering|pages=1\u201311}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nEncyclopedia Brittanica defines Humanitarian engineering as:<blockquote>'''Humanitarian engineering''', the application of engineering to improving the well-being of marginalized people and disadvantaged communities, usually in the developing world. Humanitarian engineering typically focuses on programs that are affordable, sustainable, and based on local resources. Projects are typically community-driven and cross-disciplinary, and they focus on finding simple solutions to basic needs (such as close access to clean water; adequate heat, shelter, and sanitation; and reliable pathways to markets). <ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1007035768|title=ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA : microscope.|last=BRITTANICA, ENCYCLOPEDIA.|date=2016|publisher=HANSEBOOKS|isbn=3742823515|oclc=1007035768}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== History ==\nThe existence of the phrase \"humanitarian engineering\" has only been somewhat commonplace since the early 2000's. In fact, the usage of the phrase \"humanitarian engineering\" practically does not exist in any professional literature from the 1800s to the year 2000. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=humanitarian+engineering&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=0&share=&direct_url=|title=Google Ngram Viewer|website=books.google.com|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the concept of utilizing engineering as a mechanism of promoting societal welfare has been something that has existed since the early days of the discipline. <ref>{{Citation|title=Engineering ethics|date=2019-09-19|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engineering_ethics&oldid=916638944|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> It was something that evolved out of the creation of an engineering code of ethics as well as the acceptance of a widespread engineering ethics as a whole. While initially, the notion of ethics was something meant to be a personal decision, over time, a general framework of what an engineer ought to do became established. The creation of organizations such as the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] furthered this trend, as many such organizations began to adopt codes of ethics specifically meant to create a ethics framework for engineers. Within these codes of ethics, obligations that engineers have to society were explicitly stated including ideas like: \"Engineers shall at all times strive to serve the public interest.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|title=Code of Ethics {{!}} National Society of Professional Engineers|website=www.nspe.org|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> This evolved into the creation of humanitarian engineering projects meant to promote such societal welfare. As a result, in the early days of the discipline, humanitarian engineering was really only an application of engineering ethics as well as something that was just a part of individual engineering disciplines.\n\nAs a discipline of study, though, it was around 2003, when the Colorado School of Mines created the first humanitarian engineering minor, that humanitarian engineering truly gained more recognition. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://humanitarian.mines.edu/|title=Humanitarian Engineering|website=Humanitarian Engineering|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> Over time, as more and more universities have created programs explicitly for humanitarian engineering, it has grown more as a standalone discipline, rather than just an implicit part of general engineering discipline. \u00a0\n\n== Relationships with other disciplines ==\nMost engineering disciplines have a code of ethics that encourage working to improve the general welfare. For example: The Institute of Civil Engineers actively encourages the utilization of civil engineering in humanitarian work, calling it the \"highest calling\" of the occupation. Active work in the field ranges from an understanding and safety in humanitarian projects, to case studies on road building, refugee camps, footbridges, disaster response, housing and environmental clean-up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.org.uk/news-and-insight/the-civil-engineer/may-2016/humanitarian-engineering|title=Humanitarian engineering: as good as it gets|date=2016-04-05|website=Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE)|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> Likewise, organizations for other disciplines such as Chemical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering also encourage applying their respective disciplines for humanitarian engineering. This is coupled with the fact that many organizations, especially universities, conduct humanitarian engineering products utilizing skills from specific disciplines. \u00a0<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ewb.berkeley.edu/projects/peru/|title=PERU PROJECT \u2013 Engineers Without Borders|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\n== Notable projects ==\n\n=== The Peru Project ===\nThe Peru Project originated at UC Berkeley's chapter of Engineer's Without Borders, and its goal was to introduce safe water sources to communities affected by groundwater wells that contained high levels of arsenic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ewb.berkeley.edu/projects/|title=PROJECTS \u2013 Engineers Without Borders|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> The engineers built rainwater catchment systems in schools which utilized roof gutters to collect rainwater, a flush system to filter debris from the gutters, and a tank to collect the water. The water is made drinkable through chlorine disinfection and is distributed to other locations through piping. This has provided the community with clean water that is safe for consumption and cooking.<ref name=\":0\" /> The second initiative saw the group partnering with local health ministries to formulate a comprehensive arsenic education program to teach the community about the dangers of consumption.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://ewb.berkeley.edu/projects/peru/|title=PERU PROJECT \u2013 Engineers Without Borders|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Hydropower Development in Pakistan ===\nThis project led by Oregon State University involves students and faculty helping Pakistan attempt to harvest their potential for hydropower generation.

Dartmouth engineers were tasked with locating an appropriate location for a well, securing a permit for drilling, building the well, and installing a solar-powered water pump; Louisiana State University students would be in charge of building a water distribution system. After overcoming various setbacks, the engineers managed to complete the project with assistance from the village residents. The result of this project was a 30,000-liter tank and 6,000 meters of pipe that helped distribute this water within a two-kilometer radius.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/magazine/humanitarian-engineering|title=Humanitarian Engineering {{!}} Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth|website=engineering.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\n== Training and education ==\nAn education in humanitarian engineering incorporates history, politics, economics, sociology, language, as well as rigorous engineering basics. Several universities in the [[United States]] focus efforts on Humanitarian Engineering:\n\n[[Colorado School of Mines]] was the first school in the U.S. to offer Humanitarian Engineering as a minor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://humanitarian.mines.edu/history/|title=History|website=Humanitarian Engineering|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>The Colorado School of Mines' Humanitarian Engineering program currently offers minors in Engineering for Community Development and Leadership in Social Responsibility, and a Master's Degree in Humanitarian Engineering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://humanitarian.mines.edu/|title=Humanitarian Engineering|website=Humanitarian Engineering|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\n[[The Ohio State University]], which also offers a minor in the field, has many local and international service projects, courses, and research in Humanitarian Engineering. OSU has been engaged in humanitarian engineering since 1979, and has grown to fully involve students since 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://osuhe.engineering.osu.edu/definition-and-goals-0|title=Definition and Goals|website=Humanitarian Engineering Center|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> Some of their student organizations include Engineers for Community Service (ECOS), who completed a project at an orphanage in Monta\u00f1a de Luz to help children affected by HIV/AIDS.
