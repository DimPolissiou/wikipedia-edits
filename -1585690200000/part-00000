D.]] (born 7 March 1934) is an Indigenous [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[architect]] based in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada. His flowing architecture marked with smooth curvilinear forms is influenced by his [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] heritage as well as European [[Expressionist architecture]].<ref name=\"CE\">[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/douglas-joseph-cardinal/ Douglas Cardinal], The Canadian Encyclopedia</ref> This passion for unconventional forms and appreciation of nature and landscape was present in his life from the very young age. It consequently developed into his unique architectural style that he followed throughout his career. Cardinal is perhaps best known for his designs of the [[Canadian Museum of History]] in [[Gatineau, Quebec]] (1989) and the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1998).<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=39}}</ref> He is considered one of the most influential Canadian architects, who shaped and preserved indigenous architecture and culture in the modern history.\n\n==Life==\nBorn in [[Calgary, Alberta]], Cardinal is the eldest of eight children of Joseph and Frances Cardinal. His father was of [[Blackfoot]]/Kainai and Algonquin heritage, and his mother was of German and [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] descent.<ref name=\"CE\"/> His mother worked as a nurse and was very well educated. Cardinal's parents met in 1926, and in the first half of the 20th century women had very little status and rights. The patriarchal society did not recognize educated women like Frances Cardinal. However, his father's tribe's societal norms accepted a matrilineal culture, where women are very respected and admired.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2018|title=Douglas Cardinal|url=|journal=The Canadian Architect|volume= 63, Iss. 2|pages=30\u201332|via=}}</ref> These cultural ideas shaped Cardinal's upbringing and affected his worldview and relationship with his heritage. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be an architect,\u201d he later remembered his mother pushing and believing in him.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nCardinal grew up in a small city of [[Red Deer, Alberta]]. He was sent to St. Joseph's Convent Catholic Residential school. Later he attended the remaining high school years in Red Deer. His religious school influenced him immensely. Living away from the rest of his family made him focus on his academic achievements. [[Grey Nuns]] of convent school taught him about arts and culture, which also determined his future career. Traditional sacral architecture and its role in the culture made him want to create spaces as powerful and inspirational as churches and basilicas. It also ignited in him a passion for architecture in those early years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, he started studying architecture in the [[University of British Columbia]], or UBC. He attended the institution for two years and had to leave due to his radical ideas. His different approach towards architecture did not align with the ideas of modernism at the time. He wanted to create buildings responding to the nature and the organic rhythm of life, which was unprecedented in the 1950s.<ref name=\":1\" /> In his third year of studies, he was told by the director at UBC that Cardinal had \"a wrong background\" for the program and the profession. After he left Vancouver, he returned to Red Deer and started working at local architectural firms as a draftsman. His ejection from UBC made it impossible for him to apply to Canadian university again. Cardinal himself also wanted a change of scenery due to racism towards indigenous people in his home country.<ref name=\":1\" /> He decided to head south, quickly stopping in Arizona and Mexico, and later settling in Texas. Eventually, he attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], from which he graduated with a degree in Architecture in 1963.\n\nIn university, he also studied cultural anthropology, because his cultural heritage and philosophy were based on the sacredness of life and nature. He wanted to study people and did not feel that the buildings were designed around people. His philosophy also intertwines with the philosophy of another famous architect [[Rudolf Steiner|Rudolph Steiner]], whom Douglas studied in University of Texas. Steiner's work inspired Douglas to study [[anthropomorphism]], which he applied to his work as well.<ref name=\":0\" /> The idea of anthropomorphism and its concept of responding to the human behavior, natural cycle of life and beauty of sacred land and tectonics aligned with Cardinal's philosophy and his cultural heritage. Another great inspiration for Cardinal were works of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. He appreciated his organic way of responding to landscape with the use of natural materials, such as stone and brick.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=17}}</ref> The racism he was experiencing in Canada was subsided after he moved to Texas. He accepted his indigenous heritage and one of his professors encouraged him to learn more about his background.\n\n==Career==\nCardinal opened his private practice in 1964, and the same year he was commissioned to design St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta.<ref>https://www.stmarysparishreddeer.com/parish/history/</ref> Construction was completed in 1968, and it has since been recognized as a prominent example in the history of Canadian architecture. In 2007 the church was featured on a Canada Post stamp series featuring four Canadian architects to commemorate the centennial of the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada (RAIC).<ref>https://postagestampguide.com/stamps/17713/st-mary-s-church-2007-canada-postage-stamp-royal-architectural-institute-of-canada-100-years</ref>\n\nBeginning with his work on St. Mary's, Cardinal was one of the first North American architects to use computers to assist in the design process. His curvilinear designs reflect the landscape around them, so that people making use of the building can retain a sense of the surrounding land. He found that the use of computerized design would fit best for his unusual designs and the use of shapes. He also found 3D programs very useful for laying out exact dimensions of the buildings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=44}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he was hired by The [[Smithsonian Institution]] as the Primary Design Architect for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], or NMAI. The NMAI is situated on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and directly faces the Capital of the United States of America. After contractual disputes, Cardinal was removed from the project in 1998 before it was completed, but he continued to provide input into the building's design.\n\nIn 2008, his firm was hired by the Kirkland Foundation to design a museum/convention center in Union City, Tenn.  The [[Discovery Park of America]] was to be a unique structure housing a multi level museum with artifacts from across the nation as well as provide a place for large conventions/meetings for the community.  Early in 2009 the firm's contract was terminated with the owner, and all construction activity was halted, due to undisclosed differences between the two parties.\n[[File:Douglas Cardinal.jpg|thumb|193x193px|Douglas Cardinal in 1970s]]\n\n=== Architectural Style and Philosophy ===\nThroughout his early years, Douglas Cardinal was dealing with racism and societal ideas of conformity for both his lifestyle and architecture. Only in his years in Texas he started to fully embrace his indigenous heritage and learn more about it.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=26}}</ref> In 1970s Cardinal developed his trademark architectural style with organic curvilinear forms. In those years he started wearing native clothes and necklaces, as well as becoming an advocate for indigenous rights.<ref name=\":2\" /> This spiritual connection with his native culture affected and influenced his work and unique architectural approach. Many philosophical ideas of indigenous history include its respect and sensibility towards nature, humans' inseparable relationship with the environment and land. These concepts resulted in his use of natural materials, organic shapes, soil and sun studies, as well as creating spaces that move people spiritually and make them appreciative of their surroundings. The native philosophy is also very contrasting from the Western civilization worldview due to its use of time. It is appreciative of resilience of nature and its ability to withstand hard conditions. Therefore, its architecture aims to last for seven generations, as opposed to the economically driven and efficient approach of the patriachial society.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:St. Mary's Church, Red Deer, Alberta.jpg|left|thumb|Cardinal's first building - St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta]]\n\n=== St. Mary's Church ===\nSt. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta is Cardinal's first building. Upon his return to Alberta, Cardinal met with Father Werner Merx, who wanted the new church be innovative and unique. The archbishop of the church has already appointed another architect for the job, but Merx insisted on hiring Cardinal and realizing his vision. The archbishop whom they needed to convince turned out to be Anthony Jordan, who helped to resolve legal case for Cardinal 10 years earlier. Douglas Cardinal was approved for a job.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=22}}</ref>\n\nThe church has 750 seats inside and includes tubular skylights for natural daylight. Cardinal started his first project in 1967 and it turned out to be so challenging that he doubted if he could survive its completion. However, the building became one of his iconic designs that determined his architectural style. He combined all of his philosophical and cultural ideas and created a church that represented his many beliefs towards the nature and organic forms, that is unique and unprecedented for its time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=24}}</ref>\n\n=== Canadian Museum of History ===\n[[File:Gatineau - QC - Museum of Civilisation2.jpg|thumb|Canadian Museum of History|alt=]]This building, opened in 1989 as Canadian Museum of Civilization at the time, is another project that is very representative of Cardinal's architectural style. Influenced by his indigenous heritage it focuses on the response to its surroundings. It is located on the banks of the Ottawa River, facing [[Parliament Hill]]. All the massive government buildings in the city center are clustered and turned away from the river. Cardinal opened the Great Hall towards the river, making it the only building in the area that is responding to it. This approach also translated into the wrapping facade with curves that can embrace and invite people inside and create welcoming environment.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=28}}</ref> The envelope of the building is shaped in an organic form, as if sculptured by the forces of nature. He also wanted to acknowledge his appreciation for the Parliament by using the same limestone as the one used in the building. Besides responding to the site conditions, the museum also engages with its historic context by including totem poles and native murals inside the building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=29}}</ref> He wanted the space inside feel alive and dynamic, and not limit its form to the programmatic requirements.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=34}}</ref> Former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau also encouraged Cardinal to create a museum where people embrace their different backgrounds and learn from each other. Prime minister's idea for multicultural Canadian society aligned well with Cardinal's vision.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=31}}</ref> The overall concept and purpose of the building corresponded with his ideas. However, in 1984 new government was not approving of Cardinal's design. He then lost his team on the project and was not fully paid for his previous work. This was a tremendous loss for the architect, but he was too driven to fulfill this project and was not willing to give up. After long years of defending his design, he eventually finished the museum and it became on of his many fundamental projects.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n=== The Group of Seven ===\nIn 20th century, there were several artistic hierarchies, such as [[Group of Seven (artists)|Canadian Group of Seven]]. Cardinal was part of a similar group that included Greatest Canadian Postwar Architects, along with Moshe Safdie, Raymond Moriyama, Eberhard Zeidler, Arthur Erickson, Ray Affleck and Ron Thom. This environment was encouraging for the architect and they often shared ideas and passion to create great architecture.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=36}}</ref> Although all of their styles and conceptual vision were different, they all agreed on creating with meaning and beauty, instead of commercial skyscrapers of that era. However, his personal and financial problems often made him lose his direction and consequently he did not receive as much recognition as his peers.<ref name=\":3\" /> These instances include his design of the Grand Prairie Regional College in Alberta. Opened in 1974, this project did not meet government's simplistic and modernistic vision for the project and went over budget.\n\n==Works==\nAmong the many projects Cardinal has completed in his career are the following:<ref name=Doyle>{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Richard I.|title=Renaissance II: Canadian creativity and innovation in the new millennium|year=2001|publisher=Intercept Ltd|isbn=978-0-660-18397-8|pages=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WrhJnmXdBIC&pg=PA38&dq=Douglas+Cardinal#v=onepage&q=Douglas%20Cardinal&f=false}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nSpruce Grove City Hall.jpg|Spruce Grove City Hall (1981) in [[Spruce Grove]], [[Alberta]]\nSpace-and-Science-Centre-Edmonton-Alberta.jpg|[[Edmonton Space and Science Centre|Edmonton Space And Science Centre]] (1984) Coronation Park, [[Edmonton, Alberta]], which has since been renovated and rebranded as the [[Telus World of Science]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\nGatineau - QC - Museum of Civilisation3.jpg|[[Canadian Museum of History]] (1989) in [[Gatineau, Quebec]], opposite [[Parliament Hill]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\nYork Region Administrative Centre 02.jpg|[[York Regional Council#York Region Administrative Centre|York Region Administrative Centre]] (1992) in [[Newmarket, Ontario]]\nNational Museum of the American Indian.JPG|[[Smithsonian]] [[National Museum of the American Indian]] (1993\u20131998) [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>\nOuj\u00e9-Bougoumou.jpg|Cultural Institute (1996) [[Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou, Qu\u00e9bec]]\nFirst Nations University 4.jpg|[[First Nations University of Canada|First Nations University]] (2003) in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]\nGordon Oakes Red Bear Centre.jpg|Gordon Oakes Red Bear Centre (2016) at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]\n</gallery>\n* St. Mary's Church (1968) [[Red Deer, Alberta]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\n* St. Albert Place & City Hall (1976) [[St. Albert, Alberta]]\n* Alberta Government Services (Provincial) Building (1976) [[Ponoka, Alberta]]\n* [[Grande Prairie Regional College]] (1976) [[Grande Prairie]], [[Alberta]]\n* Leighton Artist Colony, at the Banff Centre (1985) [[Banff, Alberta]]\n*Wabano Centre (2013) [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Grotski Residence (1978) [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]]\n*Bonneville Rehabilitation Centre [[Bonnyville|Bonnyville, Alberta]]\n*Ojigkwanong Students Centre, Carleton University, [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Ile a la Crosse Elementary School [[\u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse|\u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan]]\n*Cardinal Studio [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]]\n*Ouje' Bougoumou Village, [[Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou|Ouje' Bougoumou, Quebec]]\n*Janvier Gallery [[Cold Lake, Alberta]]\n*Grand Traverse Civic Centre Ottawa, Ontario\n*Circle of Life Thunderbird Place (2001) [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]]\n*Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall (1991) [[Gatineau|Gatineau, Quebec]]\n*Kanai Middle School (1996) Sioux Valley, Manitoba\n*Iskotew Healing Lodge [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Sioux Valley (1986) Sioux Valley, Manitoba\n*Cardinal Residence (1982) [[Stony Plain, Alberta]]\n*Fairview Elementary School (1975) [[Red Deer, Alberta]]\n*Precam Elementary School (1976) La Ronge, Edmonton\n*Long Point First Nation, [[Winneway|Winneway,\u00a0Quebec]]\n*Me-No-Ya Win Health Centre (2010) [[Sioux Lookout|Sioux lookout, Ontario]]\n*Adelante Healthcare Goodyear Project (2018) [[Mesa, Arizona]]\n*Gordon Oakes Redbear Students Centre (2016) [[Saskatoon|Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]]\n*Unceded: Voices of the Land Exhibition (2018) [[Venice Biennale]]\n\n== Achievements ==\n\n=== Writings ===\n\n* ''Of the Spirit,'' NeWest Press (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada), 1977.<ref name=\":4\">Douglas Joseph Cardinal.

Her Irish Catholic family did not accept of their relationship because of his heritage and the two of them eloped. This also was a problem, because Cardinal had charges pressed against him as an interracial marriage was illegal at the time. He was defended by the archbishop lawyer Anthony Jordan and was not found guilty. Deirdre then was pressured to move back with her family, and was raising their first daughter alone.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nShortly before he decided to go the Unites States, he started a relationship with Carole Olson. She accompanied him on a road trip 1957 to Texas and they later got married. They had three children - Nancy, Guy and Bret. The couple split during their years in America due to his preoccupation with work.<ref name=\":7\" /> His son Bret is also an architect and has worked with his father for 25 years until he started his own architecture firm.\n\nHe married Marylin Zahar in 1973, with whom he had two children - Lisa and Jean-Marc.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHis current wife Idoia Arana-Beobide is also of Basque indigenous heritage.

D.]] (born 7 March 1934) is an Indigenous [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[architect]] based in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada. His flowing architecture marked with smooth curvilinear forms is influenced by his [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] heritage as well as European [[Expressionist architecture]].<ref name=\"CE\">[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/douglas-joseph-cardinal/ Douglas Cardinal], The Canadian Encyclopedia</ref>This passion for unconventional forms and appreciation of nature and landscape was present in his life from the very young age. It consequently developed into his unique architectural style that he followed throughout his career. Cardinal is perhaps best known for his designs of the [[Canadian Museum of History]] in [[Gatineau, Quebec]] (1989) and the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1998).<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=39}}</ref> He is considered one of the most influential Canadian architects, who shaped and preserved indigenous architecture and culture in the modern history.\n\n==Life==\nBorn in [[Calgary, Alberta]], Cardinal is the eldest of eight children of Joseph and Frances Cardinal. His father was of [[Blackfoot]]/Kainai and Algonquin heritage, and his mother was of German and [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] descent.<ref name=\"CE\"/> His mother worked as a nurse and was very well educated. Cardinal's parents met in 1926, and in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century women had very little status and rights. The patriarchal society did not recognize educated women like Frances Cardinal. However, his father\u2019s tribe\u2019s societal norms accepted a matrilineal culture, where women are very respected and admired.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2018|title=Douglas Cardinal|url=|journal=The Canadian Architect|volume=Vol. 63, Iss. 2|pages=30-32|via=}}</ref> These cultural ideas shaped Cardinal\u2019s upbringing and affected his worldview and relationship with his heritage. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be an architect,\u201d he later remembered his mother pushing and believing in him.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nCardinal grew up in a small city of [[Red Deer, Alberta]]. He was sent to St. Joseph's Convent Catholic Residential school. Later he attended the remaining high school years in Red Deer. His religious school influenced him immensely. Living away from the rest of his family made him focus on his academic achievements. [[Grey Nuns]] of convent school taught him about arts and culture, which also determined his future career. Traditional sacral architecture and its role in the culture made him want to create spaces as powerful and inspirational as churches and basilicas. It also ignited in him a passion for architecture in those early years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, he started studying architecture in the [[University of British Columbia]], or UBC. He attended the institution for two years and had to leave due to his radical ideas. His different approach towards architecture did not align with the ideas of modernism at the time. He wanted to create buildings responding to the nature and the organic rhythm of life, which was unprecedented in the 1950s.<ref name=\":1\" /> In his third year of studies, he was told by the director at UBC that Cardinal had \"a wrong background\" for the program and the profession. After he left Vancouver, he returned to Red Deer and started working at local architectural firms as a draftsman. His ejection from UBC made it impossible for him to apply to Canadian university again. Cardinal himself also wanted a change of scenery due to racism towards indigenous people in his home country.<ref name=\":1\" /> He decided to head south, quickly stopping in Arizona and Mexico, and later settling in Texas. Eventually, he attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], from which he graduated with a degree in Architecture in 1963.\n\nIn university, he also studied cultural anthropology, because his cultural heritage and philosophy were based on the sacredness of life and nature. He wanted to study people and didn\u2019t feel that the buildings were designed around people. His philosophy also intertwines with the philosophy of another famous architect [[Rudolf Steiner|Rudolph Steiner]], whom Douglas studied in University of Texas. Steiner\u2019s work inspired Douglas to study [[anthropomorphism]], which he applied to his work as well.<ref name=\":0\" /> The idea of anthropomorphism and its concept of responding to the human behavior, natural cycle of life and beauty of sacred land and tectonics aligned with Cardinal's philosophy and his cultural heritage. Another great inspiration for Cardinal were works of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. He appreciated his organic way of responding to landscape with the use of natural materials, such as stone and brick.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=17}}</ref> The racism he was experiencing in Canada was subsided after he moved to Texas. He accepted his indigenous heritage and one of his professors encouraged him to learn more about his background.\n\n==Career==\nCardinal opened his private practice in 1964, and the same year he was commissioned to design St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta.<ref>https://www.stmarysparishreddeer.com/parish/history/</ref> Construction was completed in 1968, and it has since been recognized as a prominent example in the history of Canadian architecture. In 2007 the church was featured on a Canada Post stamp series featuring four Canadian architects to commemorate the centennial of the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada (RAIC).<ref>https://postagestampguide.com/stamps/17713/st-mary-s-church-2007-canada-postage-stamp-royal-architectural-institute-of-canada-100-years</ref>\n\nBeginning with his work on St. Mary's, Cardinal was one of the first North American architects to use computers to assist in the design process. His curvilinear designs reflect the landscape around them, so that people making use of the building can retain a sense of the surrounding land. He found that the use of computerized design would fit best for his unusual designs and the use of shapes. He also found 3D programs very useful for laying out exact dimensions of the buildings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=44}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he was hired by The [[Smithsonian Institution]] as the Primary Design Architect for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], or NMAI. The NMAI is situated on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and directly faces the Capital of the United States of America. After contractual disputes, Cardinal was removed from the project in 1998 before it was completed, but he continued to provide input into the building's design.\n\nIn 2008, his firm was hired by the Kirkland Foundation to design a museum/convention center in Union City, Tenn.  The [[Discovery Park of America]] was to be a unique structure housing a multi level museum with artifacts from across the nation as well as provide a place for large conventions/meetings for the community.  Early in 2009 the firm's contract was terminated with the owner, and all construction activity was halted, due to undisclosed differences between the two parties.\n[[File:Douglas Cardinal.jpg|thumb|193x193px|Douglas Cardinal in 1970s]]\n\n=== Architectural Style and Philosophy ===\nThroughout his early years, Douglas Cardinal was dealing with racism and societal ideas of conformity for both his lifestyle and architecture. Only in his years in Texas he started to fully embrace his indigenous heritage and learn more about it.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=26}}</ref> In 1970s Cardinal developed his trademark architectural style with organic curvilinear forms. In those years he started wearing native clothes and necklaces, as well as becoming an advocate for indigenous rights.<ref name=\":2\" /> This spiritual connection with his native culture affected and influenced his work and unique architectural approach. Many philosophical ideas of indigenous history include its respect and sensibility towards nature, humans' inseparable relationship with the environment and land. These concepts resulted in his use of natural materials, organic shapes, soil and sun studies, as well as creating spaces that move people spiritually and make them appreciative of their surroundings. The native philosophy is also very contrasting from the Western civilization worldview due to its use of time. It is appreciative of resilience of nature and its ability to withstand hard conditions. Therefore, its architecture aims to last for seven generations, as opposed to the economically driven and efficient approach of the patriachial society.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:St. Mary's Church, Red Deer, Alberta.jpg|left|thumb|Cardinal's first building - St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta]]\n\n=== St. Mary's Church ===\nSt. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta is Cardinal's first building. Upon his return to Alberta, Cardinal met with Father Werner Merx, who wanted the new church be innovative and unique. The archbishop of the church has already appointed another architect for the job, but Merx insisted on hiring Cardinal and realizing his vision. The archbishop whom they needed to convince turned out to be Anthony Jordan, who helped to resolve legal case for Cardinal 10 years earlier. Douglas Cardinal was approved for a job.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=22}}</ref>\n\nThe church has 750 seats inside and includes tubular skylights for natural daylight. Cardinal started his first project in 1967 and it turned out to be so challenging that he doubted if he could survive its completion. However, the building became one of his iconic designs that determined his architectural style. He combined all of his philosophical and cultural ideas and created a church that represented his many beliefs towards the nature and organic forms, that is unique and unprecedented for its time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=24}}</ref>\n\n=== Canadian Museum of History ===\n[[File:Gatineau - QC - Museum of Civilisation2.jpg|thumb|Canadian Museum of History|alt=]]This building, opened in 1989 as Canadian Museum of Civilization at the time, is another project that is very representative of Cardinal's architectural style. Influenced by his indigenous heritage it focuses on the response to its surroundings. It is located on the banks of the Ottawa River, facing [[Parliament Hill]]. All the massive government buildings in the city center are clustered and turned away from the river. Cardinal opened the Great Hall towards the river, making it the only building in the area that is responding to it. This approach also translated into the wrapping facade with curves that can embrace and invite people inside and create welcoming environment.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=28}}</ref> The envelope of the building is shaped in an organic form, as if sculptured by the forces of nature. He also wanted to acknowledge his appreciation for the Parliament by using the same limestone as the one used in the building. Besides responding to the site conditions, the museum also engages with its historic context by including totem poles and native murals inside the building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=29}}</ref> He wanted the space inside feel alive and dynamic, and not limit its form to the programmatic requirements.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=34}}</ref> Former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau also encouraged Cardinal to create a museum where people embrace their different backgrounds and learn from each other. Prime minister's idea for multicultural Canadian society aligned well with Cardinal's vision.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=31}}</ref> The overall concept and purpose of the building corresponded with his ideas. However, in 1984 new government was not approving of Cardinal's design. He then lost his team on the project and was not fully paid for his previous work. This was a tremendous loss for the architect, but he was too driven to fulfill this project and was not willing to give up. After long years of defending his design, he eventually finished the museum and it became on of his many fundamental projects.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n=== The Group of Seven ===\nIn 20th century, there were several artistic hierarchies, such as [[Group of Seven (artists)|Canadian Group of Seven]]. Cardinal was part of a similar group that included Greatest Canadian Postwar Architects, along with Moshe Safdie, Raymond Moriyama, Eberhard Zeidler, Arthur Erickson, Ray Affleck and Ron Thom. This environment was encouraging for the architect and they often shared ideas and passion to create great architecture.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=36}}</ref> Although all of their styles and conceptual vision were different, they all agreed on creating with meaning and beauty, instead of commercial skyscrapers of that era. However, his personal and financial problems often made him lose his direction and consequently he did not receive as much recognition as his peers.<ref name=\":3\" /> These instances include his design of the Grand Prairie Regional College in Alberta. Opened in 1974, this project did not meet government's simplistic and modernistic vision for the project and went over budget.\n\n==Works==\nAmong the many projects Cardinal has completed in his career are the following:<ref name=Doyle>{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Richard I.|title=Renaissance II: Canadian creativity and innovation in the new millennium|year=2001|publisher=Intercept Ltd|isbn=978-0-660-18397-8|pages=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WrhJnmXdBIC&pg=PA38&dq=Douglas+Cardinal#v=onepage&q=Douglas%20Cardinal&f=false}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nSpruce Grove City Hall.jpg|Spruce Grove City Hall (1981) in [[Spruce Grove]], [[Alberta]]\nSpace-and-Science-Centre-Edmonton-Alberta.jpg|[[Edmonton Space and Science Centre|Edmonton Space And Science Centre]] (1984) Coronation Park, [[Edmonton, Alberta]], which has since been renovated and rebranded as the [[Telus World of Science]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\nGatineau - QC - Museum of Civilisation3.jpg|[[Canadian Museum of History]] (1989) in [[Gatineau, Quebec]], opposite [[Parliament Hill]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\nYork Region Administrative Centre 02.jpg|[[York Regional Council#York Region Administrative Centre|York Region Administrative Centre]] (1992) in [[Newmarket, Ontario]]\nNational Museum of the American Indian.JPG|[[Smithsonian]] [[National Museum of the American Indian]] (1993\u20131998) [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>\nOuj\u00e9-Bougoumou.jpg|Cultural Institute (1996) [[Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou, Qu\u00e9bec]]\nFirst Nations University 4.jpg|[[First Nations University of Canada|First Nations University]] (2003) in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]\nGordon Oakes Red Bear Centre.jpg|Gordon Oakes Red Bear Centre (2016) at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]\n</gallery>\n* St. Mary's Church (1968) [[Red Deer, Alberta]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\n* St. Albert Place & City Hall (1976) [[St. Albert, Alberta]]\n* Alberta Government Services (Provincial) Building (1976) [[Ponoka, Alberta]]\n* [[Grande Prairie Regional College]] (1976) [[Grande Prairie]], [[Alberta]]\n* Leighton Artist Colony, at the Banff Centre (1985) [[Banff, Alberta]]\n*Wabano Centre (2013) [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Grotski Residence (1978) [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]]\n*Bonneville Rehabilitation Centre [[Bonnyville|Bonnyville, Alberta]]\n*Ojigkwanong Students Centre, Carleton University, [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Ile a la Crosse Elementary School [[\u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse|\u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan]]\n*Cardinal Studio [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]]\n*Ouje' Bougoumou Village, [[Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou|Ouje' Bougoumou, Quebec]]\n*Janvier Gallery [[Cold Lake, Alberta]]\n*Grand Traverse Civic Centre Ottawa, Ontario\n*Circle of Life Thunderbird Place (2001) [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]]\n*Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall (1991) [[Gatineau|Gatineau, Quebec]]\n*Kanai Middle School (1996) Sioux Valley, Manitoba\n*Iskotew Healing Lodge [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Sioux Valley (1986) Sioux Valley, Manitoba\n*Cardinal Residence (1982) [[Stony Plain, Alberta]]\n*Fairview Elementary School (1975) [[Red Deer, Alberta]]\n*Precam Elementary School (1976) La Ronge, Edmonton\n*Long Point First Nation, [[Winneway|Winneway,\u00a0Quebec]]\n*Me-No-Ya Win Health Centre (2010) [[Sioux Lookout|Sioux lookout, Ontario]]\n*Adelante Healthcare Goodyear Project (2018) [[Mesa, Arizona]]\n*Gordon Oakes Redbear Students Centre (2016) [[Saskatoon|Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]]\n*Unceded: Voices of the Land Exhibition (2018) [[Venice Biennale]]\n\n== Achievements ==\n\n=== Writings ===\n\n* ''Of the Spirit,'' NeWest Press (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada), 1977.<ref name=\":4\">Douglas Joseph Cardinal.

Her Irish Catholic family did not accept of their relationship because of his heritage and the two of them eloped. This also was a problem, because Cardinal had charges pressed against him as an interracial marriage was illegal at the time. He was defended by the archbishop lawyer Anthony Jordan and was not found guilty. Deirdre then was pressured to move back with her family, and was raising their first daughter alone.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nShortly before he decided to go the the Unites States, he started a relationship with Carole Olson. She accompanied him on a road trip 1957 to Texas and they later got married. They had three children - Nancy, Guy and Bret. The couple split during their years in America due to his preoccupation with work.<ref name=\":7\" /> His son Bret is also an architect and has worked with his father for 25 years until he started his own architecture firm.\n\nHe married Marylin Zahar in 1973, with whom he had two children - Lisa and Jean-Marc.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHis current wife Idoia Arana-Beobide is also of Basque indigenous heritage. Together they have two children.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=46}}</ref> His wife works as a director at his architectural firm.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHall, J.

XCB is written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and distributed under the [[MIT License]]. The project was started in 2001 by Bart Massey and aims to replace [[Xlib]].\n\n==Overview==\nXCB was designed as a smaller, modernized replacement for Xlib, previously the primary C library for communicating with the X window system, coinciding with a more complete overhaul of the X implementation that took place during the early 2000s.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Gettys |first1=James |first2=Keith |last2=Packard |title=The (Re) Architecture of the X Window System |conference=Proc. Linux Symposium |volume=1 |year=2004 |url=https://keithp.com/~keithp/talks/xarch_ols2004/xarch_ols2004.pdf}}</ref> The main goals of XCB are to:\n* reduce library size and complexity\n* provide direct access to the [[X Window core protocol|X11 protocol]]\n\nThe required size reduction is achieved primarily by restricting XCB's scope to handling the X protocol and omitting Xlib functionality such as its extensive utility library, much of which saw little use by applications. This results in a factor thirty reduction of the compiled library size (as of 2004).<ref>{{cite conference |first=Jamey |last=Sharp |title=How Xlib is Implemented (And What We're Doing About It) |conference=Proc.

XCB is written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and distributed under the [[MIT License]]. The project was started in 2001 by Bart Massey and aims to replace [[Xlib]].\n\n==Overview==\nXCB was designed as a smaller, modernized replacement for Xlib, previously the primary C library for communicating with the X window system, coinciding with a more complete overhaul of the X implementation that took place during the early 2000s.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Gettys |first1=James |first2=Keith |last2=Packard |title=The (Re) Architecture of the X Window System |conference=Proc.

This results in a factor thirty reduction of the compiled library size (as of 2004).<ref>{{cite conference |first=Jamey |last=Sharp |title=How Xlib is Implemented (And What We're Doing About It) |conference=Proc.

{"title_page": "Thistle Chapel", "text_new": "[[File:Thistle Chapel West.jpg|thumb|250px|The interior of the Thistle Chapel, looking west]]\nThe '''Thistle Chapel''', located in [[St Giles%27 Cathedral]], [[Edinburgh]], is the chapel of the [[Order of the Thistle]].\n\nAt the foundation of the [[Order of the Thistle]] in 1687, [[James II of England|James VII]] ordered [[Holyrood Abbey]] be fitted out as a chapel for the Knights. At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within [[St Giles%27 Cathedral]]. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork.  [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Holyrood Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|300px|The interior of Holyrood Abbey as the chapel of the Order of the Thistle]]\n===Holyrood Abbey===\n\nOn 29 May 1687, [[James II of England|James VII]] founded the [[Order of the Thistle]] and issued a warrant to designate [[Holyrood Abbey]] the chapel of the new order. This change of purpose necessitated the eventual removal of the Abbey's [[Church of Scotland]] congregation to the [[Canongate Kirk]].<ref name=Burnett9>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn the seventeen months after the publication of the warrant, [[William Bruce (architect)|William Bruce]] oversaw the transformation of the Abbey: an altar and black and white marble floor were added and classical stalls were shipped from London. The Order of the Thistle never met in its new chapel: on 10 December 1688, in the wake of [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]], a mob from Edinburgh destroyed the furnishings.<ref name=Burnett9/><ref name=BurnettHodgson6>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2000, p. 6.</ref>\n\n===Proposals for a new chapel===\n\nAlthough the order was revived in 1703 by [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], no chapel was designated. In 1728, the antiquarian William Douglas suggested the ruins of St Rule's Church in the grounds of [[St Andrews Cathedral]] be restored as a chapel for the order.<ref name=Burnett9/>\nProposals to locate the chapel of the Order in St Giles' go back to 1872, when Secretary of the Order corresponded with the committee for the then-ongoing restoration of the church. In 1879 and 1882, Lindsay Mackersy, session clerk of the High Kirk, and the [[Session (Presbyterianism)|kirk session]]  proposed the south transept of St Giles' as a chapel for the Order. None of these proposals proved practical.<ref name=BurnettHodgson6/><ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 128-129.</ref><ref name=Burnett910>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 9-10.</ref>\n\nIn 1836, [[James Gillespie Graham]] and [[Augustus Pugin]] had drawn up plans to restore Holyrood Abbey as the chapel of the Order. Although Graham and Pugin's plans were not acted upon at the time, the same ambition was advanced in 1905, when [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] set up a fund of \u00a340,000 to restore Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle.<ref name=Burnett910/> On investigation by [[MacGibbon and Ross|Thomas Ross]], the restoration of Holyrood Abbey was found to be impossible.<ref name=BurnettHodgson6/><ref name=Burnett10>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 10.</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nUpon the Earl's death in 1906, the fund reverted to his sons, who offered \u00a322,000 and an endowment of \u00a32,000 to construct a new chapel.<ref name=Burnett10/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 19.</ref> [[Edward VII]] appointed [[William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch]]; [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]]; [[John David Melville, 12th Earl of Leven]]; and [[Schomberg Kerr McDonnell]] as trustees with [[MacGibbon and Ross|Thomas Ross]] as architectural consultant. The King instructed to the Trustees to write to the kirk session of St. Giles' with the suggestion that a new chapel for the Order be housed in the Cathedral; on 12 March 1909, the Cathedral authorities gratefully accepted this offer. The Trustees appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The King approved Lorimer's plans and the first building contract was signed on 24 August 1909 with the foundation stone being laid on 6 November that year.<ref name=Burnett10/><ref>Matthew 1988, pp. 19-21.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 147.</ref>\n\nThe Chapel was completed by the autumn of 1910 in time for the first St Andrew's Day gathering of the Knights. The Chapel was formally opened amidst much ceremony on 19 July 1911 by [[George V]].<ref >Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 10-11.</ref> At the opening, police hid in the boiler room beneath the Chapel to guard against the threat of vandalism by [[suffragette]]s. At the end of the ceremony, the king received the Chapel's craftspeople and Lorimer was shortly afterwards knighted for his work.<ref name=Burnett11>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 11.</ref><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 21.</ref>\n\nThe Trustees insisted that \"the Thistle Chapel is a national thing\" and that, as such, preference should be shown to Scottish artisans.<ref name=Cumming39>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 39.</ref> In line with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]'s emphasis on craftsmanship and collaboration, Lorimer had already assembled a largely Edinburgh-based team of artisans. Of the major contributors to the Chapel, only [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who designed the heraldic stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied decorative metalwork \u2013 were based outside Scotland.<ref name=Boreham16>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 16.</ref><ref>Carruthers 2013, pp. 277-278.</ref> The speed with which the Chapel was completed is, in large part, due to the skill of this team of craftspeople.<ref name=Burnett11/>\n\n===Subsequent history===\nThe former boiler room in the [[undercroft]] of the Chapel was redeveloped in 1982 by [[Bernard Feilden]] and Simpson & Brown.<ref name=Boreham23>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 23.</ref> Between 1987 and 2019, a cafe occupied the space immediately below the Chapel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/lifestyle/last-supper-edinburghs-st-giles-kirk-cafe-closes-after-30-years-638803|title='Last supper at Edinburgh's St Giles as kirk cafe closes after 30 years'|website=edinburghnews.scotsman.com|access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref> \n\nOver four months in 2006, a major cleaning and preservation operation was undertaken by the firm of Charles Taylor: this was the first thorough maintenance project in the Chapel's history.<ref>Marshall 2009, p. 190.</ref>\n\nThe Thistle Chapel was temporarily closed to visitors from February 2015 after a number of valuable items were stolen.

Beneath the Chapel is an [[undercroft]] and adjoining the Chapel is the ante-chapel with arches opening into the Preston Aisle and south choir aisle of the Cathedral and an external east door and steps providing access to [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Square]].\n\nThe chapel sits in a constrained site: on the edge of St Giles\u2019 Cathedral at its north and west and constricted by [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Square]] to its south and east; the kirk session St Giles\u2019 Cathedral also required the Chapel should not interfere with services in the Cathedral or block out light into the church.<ref name=Savage85>Savage 1980, p. 85.</ref> To create an impression of grandeur, Lorimer designed the Chapel to be unusually tall: the interior of the Chapel, while only 5.5 meters (18 feet) wide and 11.5 meters (36 feet) long, is 13 meters (42 feet) tall.<ref name=GMW118>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 118.</ref><ref name=Boreham20>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 20.</ref>\n\nAt the time of the commission, [[Robert Lorimer]], a former pupil of [[Robert Rowand Anderson]] and [[George Frederick Bodley]], was roughly half-way through his architectural career; though his only major ecclesiastical commission had been [[St Peter%27s Church, Edinburgh|St Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Morningside]].<ref name=Carruthers195>Carruthers 2013, p. 195.</ref> [[John Fraser Matthew]], Lorimer\u2019s future partner, assisted Lorimer in the design of the Chapel.<ref name=matthew1078>Matthew 1988, pp. 107-108.</ref><ref name=marshall148>Marshall 2009, p. 148.</ref> Lorimer\u2019s design takes inspiration from late 15th century Gothic architecture and, in its form and in its use of [[Tracery#Curvilinear_(flowing)_tracery|curvilinear tracery]], displays the influence of [[George Frederick Bodley]].<ref name=GMW107>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 107.</ref><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 20.</ref><ref name=Gordon30>Gordon 1959, p. 30.</ref><ref name=Savage85/>\n\nThe Chapel is constructed of sandstone from Cullalo in [[Fife]]. The same stone was employed by [[William Burn]] as [[ashlar]] to face the exterior of St Giles\u2019 during the restoration of 1829-33 and by [[Robert Reid (architect)|Robert Reid]] for the construction of the Law Courts on the opposite side of [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Square]]. The exterior of the Thistle Chapel therefore appears consistent with St Giles\u2019 while complementing  other buildings on Parliament Square.<ref name=marshall148/><ref name=matthew25>Matthew 1988, p. 25.</ref> [[Christopher Hussey]] argued Lorimer was successful in creating a chapel that \u201charmonises perfectly with the Cathedral structure as a whole, but fearlessly proclaims its individuality.\u201d<ref name=Hussey80>Hussey 1931, p. 80.</ref>\n\n===Exterior===\nOn its exterior, the Chapel\u2019s base is emphasised by multiple horizontal [[Molding (decorative)|moulded]] [[Course (architecture)|course]], from which rise [[gablet roof|gableted]] [[buttress]]es; the buttresses terminate at the [[cornice]] of the [[Battlement|castellated]] [[parapet]]. The parapet conceals the flat, asphalt-covered concrete roof.<ref name=Boreham22>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 22.</ref> According to [[Christopher Hussey]], the \u201cpronounced batter of the buttresses\u201d creates \u201can illusion of height and massiveness without\u201d.<ref name=Hussey82>Hussey 1931, p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe buttresses divided the exterior into [[Bay (architecture)| bays]]: between each bay, the [[pedestal|plinth]], pierced by [[dormer]]-like ventilation holes (now glazed), slopes steeply to a sheer wall surface below a [[tracery|traceried]] [[lancet window]]. This sloping plinth was likely inspired by chapels at the east end of [[Chartres Cathedral]].<ref name=GMW107/><ref name=Carruthers195/> On the cornice above each window, a demi-angel bears a shield while below each window is the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and [[coronet]] of each Knight at the time of Chapel\u2019s construction corresponding to the arms depicted in the window.<ref name=GMW107/><ref name=Boreham22/> The [[Tracery#Curvilinear_(flowing)_tracery|curvilinear tracery]] of these windows evokes the surviving medieval tracery of St Giles\u2019.<ref name=Hussey82/> At the east end, the parapet rises to accommodate a canopied niche, in which stands a statue of Saint Andrew.<ref name=GMW108>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 108.</ref>\n\nAt the west end, an octagonal [[turret]], capped with a [[Spire|spirelet]], stands in the south corner: this contains a spiral staircase, which leads to the roof.<ref name=Boreham22/> The west window is in the form of an [[oriel window|oriel]] and the west [[gable]] is [[stepped gable|crow-stepped]].<ref name=GMW108/>\n\nBetween the south wall of Saint Giles and the north side of the Chapel, a wide flight of steps rises to the east door, which leads to the ante-chapel. The round-arched doorway dates to the 15th century and originally stood at the south entrance to St Giles\u2019. At the restoration of 1829-1833, [[William Burn]] reincorporated the doorway as part of an internal partition wall. When the Cathedral\u2019s partition walls were demolished during the restoration of 1871-1883, [[William Hay (architect)|William Hay]] reconstructed the door at the royal entrance at the east end of the church. The royal entrance was constructed during the Burn restoration and consisted of a chamber accessed by a flight of steps. During the construction of the Thistle Chapel, the royal entrance was demolished and replaced by the ante-chapel while the doorway was retained and reincorporated as the entrance to the ante-chapel.<ref name=GMW108/><ref name=R33>RCAHMS 1951, p. 33.</ref> Above the door rests a heavy heraldic [[frieze]] under an uninterrupted parapet.<ref name=GMW108/>\n\n===Interior===\n====Ante-chapel====\nThe ante-chapel is 7.6 meters (25 feet) long and 4.3 meters (14 feet) wide; it consists of two bays: in the west end and north west bay stand arches opening into St Giles\u2019 Cathedral, the external doorway occupies the eastern wall, and in the south west bay, a [[Foil (architecture)|cusped]] [[Four-centred arch|Tudor arch]] with angels on the cusps frames both the off-centre door to the Chapel and an inscription and heraldic [[relief]] in memory of [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]]. On the walls of the two eastern bays are inscribed the names of the Sovereigns and Knights from the foundation of the order in 1687 to the construction of the Chapel in 1909.<ref name=GMW1178>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 117-118.</ref><ref name=Savage85/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 31.</ref> Around the east door stands an interior glass porch added in 1983 by Simpson and Brown.<ref name=Boreham23/>\n\nThe ceiling of the ante-chapel consists of a shallow [[lierne (vault)|lierne]] vault, heavy with foliate [[boss (architecture)|bosses]]; the central bosses depict [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the [[Lion Rampant]]. There are 57 bosses and over 70 tons of stone in the ante-chapel ceiling.<ref name=Boreham33>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 33.</ref><ref name=Nicol24>Nicol 1998, p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe preconditions for the design of the Chapel required the ante-chapel to be low in order to prevent the obstruction of light from the windows of the Cathedral. Lorimer took advantage of this requirement by creating a close, sombre ante-chapel to emphasise, by contrast, the soaring proportions of the Chapel.<ref name=Boreham22/><ref>Nicol 1998, p. 10.</ref><ref>Hussey 1931, pp. 81-82.</ref>\n====Chapel====\nThe interior of the Chapel consists of three bays, an [[Apse|apsidal]] east end and a flat west end. Above the line of the stalls rise pointed windows; the single-light east window is flanked by angels. At the west end, a single [[Oriel window|oriel]] is framed by a [[Foil (architecture)|cusped]] [[lancet window|lancet]]. In the north-west two bays [[Tracery#Blind_and_open_tracery|blind tracery]] imitates the form of the windows and frames reliefs of the arms of [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|the Duke of Argyll]], [[Douglas Graham, 5th Duke of Montrose|the Duke of Montrose]], [[James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford|the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres]], and [[William Hay, 10th Marquess of Tweeddale|the Marquess of Tweeddale]].<ref name=Boreham23/><ref name=Boreham32>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 32.</ref>\n\nA shallow [[lierne (vault)|lierne]]-vaulted ceiling crowns the soaring interior of the Chapel. While the ceiling\u2019s height contrasts with the ceiling of the ante-chapel, its design is similar with large [[boss (architecture)|bosses]] dominating the ceiling. At the key-stone of each bay rests a demi-angel playing a different musical instrument. These musical angels were likely inspired by similar examples at [[Melrose Abbey]] and [[Rosslyn Chapel]].<ref name=Boreham32/> Between foliate [[Boss (architecture)|bosses]] \u2013 many of which depict national flowers of the countries of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] \u2013 a stage of bosses take the form of angels bearing the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheons]] of the eight Knights at the time of the Order\u2019s foundation and the six Knights added by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. The massive central bosses depict, from west to east, the [[Royal arms of Scotland]], [[Saint Giles]], the star of the Order of the Thistle, [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]], and [[Pelican#Christianity|the Pelican in her piety]].<ref name=Boreham32/><ref name=Hussey83>Hussey 1931, p. 83.</ref> Lorimer believed the art of vaulting reached its zenith in the [[English_Gothic_architecture#Perpendicular_Gothic|Perpendicular period]] and designed the vault in that style; at the same time, he employed large, robust bosses to evoke Scottish medieval architecture.<ref name=Hussey83/> Likewise, Lorimer\u2019s preference for heraldic angels and foliate bosses may have been inspired by similar stonework in the adjoining Preston Aisle of St Giles\u2019.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 31-32.</ref> There are 98 bosses over 200 tons of sandstone in the Chapel ceiling; the larger bosses weigh over a ton each.<ref name=Boreham32/><ref name=Nicol24/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 33.</ref>\n\n==Stonework==\nThe contract for stonework went to A. Colville & Co., whose yard was at [[Haymarket, Edinburgh|Haymarket]]. The carvings were done by Jospeh Hayes \u2013 with whom Lorimer had already collaborated \u2013 and his men, initially overseen by the foreman Thomas Somerville, who died during the construction. Over 1000 tons of stone was sculpted at the yard then transported over a mile by horse and cart to St Giles\u2019, where some final work was done as the stones were put in place.<ref name=Boreham31>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 31.</ref> Although Hayes and his men displayed independence in developing designs, Lorimer claimed ultimate authorship, insisting the masons \u201cget their cure from him\u201d.<ref name=Savage86>Savage 1980, p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe most detailed carving was done by \u201cthe Greek\u201d, whose name is not otherwise known. Among the other members of Hayes\u2019 team was [[Alexander Carrick]], who became a noted sculptor in his own right. [[Louis Deuchars]] created plaster models from which Hayes and his men worked.<ref name=Boreham31/> Heraldic devices were emblazoned by Alfred Nixon of Moxon & Carfare.<ref name=Boreham33/>\n\nThe floor of the Chapel is [[Ailsa Craig]] [[granite]] with panels of [[Iona]] [[marble]]. This was laid by Allan & Sons of [[Piershill]]. On 4 July 1962, a memorial floor plaque to [[George VI]], designed by [[Esm\u00e9 Gordon]], was unveiled by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]. The plaque was made by Stewart McGlashan & Sons of [[Canonmills]] and consists of a panel of granite with a [[bronze]] border and lettering; the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]] are formed by inlaid pieces of marble.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 37.</ref><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 46.</ref>\nIn 1927, [[Pilkington Jackson]] carved the names of the Knights and Sovereigns of the Order of the Thistle from 1687 to 1909 in the walls of the ante-chapel.<ref name=Boreham33/>\n==Woodwork==\nThe contract for the oak interior woodwork was given to the company of Nathaniel Grieve of Washinton Lane, [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry]]. Grieve\u2019s workmen executed the wood panelling and foliate borders. The most detailed woodwork was carved by the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]]-based brothers, William and Alexander Clow, mostly from designs by [[Louis Deuchars]].<ref name=matthew1078/><ref name=marshall148/><ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 45.</ref> The Clow borthers worked almost exclusively for Lorimer.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 86-87.</ref>\n\nLorimer based the design of the Knights\u2019 stalls on those at [[St George%27s Chapel, Windsor]]. Each stall is flanked by an animal on the arm-rest: some of these were based on animals that appear in the arms of the Knights and were carved by the Clow brothers from rough sketches by Lorimer. Each arm-rest bears a twisting pillar that support a canopy over the stall; on each of the cusps of these canopies is an angel with twin angels above the cusps of the Sovereign\u2019s stall, between the canopies are angels playing musical instruments. Deuchars designed each angel to be unique in appearance.<ref name=Boreham4549>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 45-49.</ref>\n\nAbove each canopy are three canopied niches. The niches of the Sovereign\u2019s stall contains sculptures of [[Saint Mungo]], [[Saint Margaret of Scotland]], and [[Saint Columba]]. Above the niches of each stall are tall, [[crocket|crocketed]] [[spire]]s surmounted by the [[coronet]], [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of each Knight.<ref name=Boreham4549/> A decorative sword stands in line with each spire: these were sculpted by Beveridge of Scott Morton & Co. and painted by Moxon & Carfrae.<ref name=Boreham51>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe Sovereign\u2019s stall at the centre of the western end is especially intricate: its spire is 10 meters (33 feet) tall while the two stalls on either side of it \u2013 which are reserved for royal Knights \u2013 descend in height to the Knights\u2019 stalls, which are 7.6 meters (25 feet) tall.<ref name=Savage86/> The book rest in front of the Sovereign\u2019s stall bears a large panel with the full achievement of the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]]; on the ends are the escutcheons of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and [[James II of England|James VII]].<ref>Gordon 1959, p. 28.</ref>\nThe [[Dado (architecture)|dado]] of the [[Apse|apsidal]] east end is panelled and surmounted by a continuous canopy of [[ogee]] arches below a pierced [[parapet]]. The panelling of the central section above the holy table is the most detailed and contains a sculpture of an allegorical winged figure defeating a dragon which represents evil.<ref name=Boreham49>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 49.</ref> This may represent [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret of Antioch]].<ref name=Matthew103>Matthew 1988, p. 103.</ref>\n\nMoxon & Carfrae of [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]] painted and stained the wood; the company subsequently held the contract to maintain the woodwork.<ref name=Boreham51/>\n===Furniture===\nA number of pieces of free-standing wooden furniture were added at the time of the Chapel\u2019s construction: these are the Dean\u2019s chair and book rest and the [[lectern]] and reader\u2019s seat. A [[credence table]] table, designed by Lorimer and carved by Nathaniel Grieve, was added in 1920; this stands in the north alcove of the apse.<ref name=Boreham51/> The table was produced to coincide with [[Graham baronets|Sir John Hatt Noble Graham\u2019s]] donation of a silver [[chalice]] and [[paten]] from the collection [[Ferdinand II of Portugal]].<ref name=Burnett69>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 69.</ref> Nathaniel Grieve also provided an attendant\u2019s seat and desk for the ante-chapel in 1927.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 52.</ref> Scott Morton & Co. provided eight oak stools in 1934.<ref name=Burnett69/>\n\nAs a memorial to [[George V]], a communion table with a short [[retable]] was commissioned from Scott Morton & Co. and designed by [[John Fraser Matthew]]. The front of the table shows the [[Lamb of God]] and the retable bears emblems of each person of the [[Trinity]]. The table replaced the chair of investiture at the east end of the Chapel. The unveiling of the table by [[George VI]] was intended for autumn 1939; however, the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] meant this was delayed until July 1943.<ref>Matthew 1988, pp. 44, 46.</ref><ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 52.</ref>\n===Crests===\nAtop the spire above each Knight\u2019s seat is a sculpted [[coronet]] and [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the incumbent Knight. Whenever a Knight dies and another Knight is appointed in his/her place, the deceased Knight\u2019s crest is replaced with that of their successor.<ref>Matthew 1988, pp. 37-38, 43.</ref>\n\nBetween the construction of the Chapel and the firm\u2019s liquidation in 1966, the crests were carved by the foreman carver of Scott Morton & Co. of Edinburgh. Moxon & Crafrae originally coloured the crests but by the time of Scott Morton & Co.\u2019s dissolution, this was done by A.C. Wood & Son. Whytock and Reid then held the contract to carve the crests until 1983; since then, the work has been done by John Donaldson of Livingston.<ref name=Boreham51/><ref name=Burnett11/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jdonaldsoncarver.co.uk/heraldic.html|title='Heraldic: a history in solid form\u2019|website=jdonaldsoncarver.co.uk|access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stained Glass==\nThe Trustees encouraged [[Robert Lorimer]] to employ a Scottish artist for the Chapel\u2019s stained glass; but Lorimer favoured the London-based stained glass designer, [[Louis Davis]]. As a compromise, Davis was commissioned to design seven windows to show the [[Coat of arms|arms]] of the Knights at the time of the Chapel\u2019s construction while the Scottish artist, Douglas Strachan, was commissioned to design the east window, depicting [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]].<ref name=Cumming39/><ref name=matthew1078/><ref name=marshall148/>\n\nEach heraldic window is split into two main lights by a central [[mullion]] with a coat of arms in each light. Lorimer insisted the arms be framed by clear glass to allow light into the Chapel.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 87.</ref> For the clear glass, Davis, in common with other stained glass artists of the Arts and Crafts movement, preferred imperfect \u2018brown\u2019 glass to entirely transparent \u2018factory\u2019 glass.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 39-42.</ref> In the top light of each window is a [[zodiac]] sign: these were designed by Davis\u2019 frequent collaborator, [[Karl Parsons]].<ref name=Cumming42>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 42.</ref>\n\nGoing clockwise the north side, the arms depicted are as follows: [[Lawrence Dundas, 1st Marquess of Zetland|the Marquess of Zetland]] and [[Charles Gore Hay, 20th Earl of Erroll|the Earl of Erroll]]; [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|the Marquess of Aberdeen]] and [[Gavin Hamilton, 2nd Baron Hamilton of Dalzell|Lord Hamilton of Dalzell]]; [[Henry John Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe|the Duke of Roxburghe]] and [[George Baillie-Hamilton-Arden, 11th Earl of Haddington|the Earl of Haddington]]; [[Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Balfour of Burleigh]] and [[Charles Douglas-Home, 12th Earl of Home|the Earl of Home]]; [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|the Earl of Rosebery]] and [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife|the Duke of Fife]]; and [[William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch|the Duke of Buccleuch]] and [[John Stewart-Murray, 7th Duke of Atholl|the Duke of Atholl]].

Unusually, Andrew is depicted in his career as a fisherman rather than at his martyrdom; as described by Elizabeth Cumming: \u201cStrachan\u2019s figure holds a natural pose, and presents Andrew as a rugged, working fisherman, his net firmly held in his arms\u201d.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 43.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, small stained glass windows replaced the ventilation grilles in the former boiler room below the Chapel; these were designed by Christian Shaw and depict the days of creation.<ref name=GMW118/><ref>Nicol 1998, p. 49.</ref>\n==Metalwork==\nThe wrought-iron gates of the ante-chapel and the iron components of the Chapel's doors were forged by Thomas Hadden and his workshop at [[Roseburn]]. Hadden based the design of the gates on medieval [[rood screen]]s. Hadden had previously collaborated with Lorimer on [[Earlshall Castle]] and [[Ardkinglas]].<ref>Matthew 1988, p. 29.</ref><ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 61-62</ref>\n\nHadden's forge also contributed the bronze curtain rails at the east end and the [[helmet (heraldry)|helms]] atop each Knight's stall. The [[coronets]] below the helms were made by T.K. Ebbutt of Hanover Street in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] and painted by Moxon & Carfrae.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 62.</ref><ref name=Boreham67>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 67.</ref> Ebbutt also made ceremonial keys for the Chapel, which show [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] on the bow.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 66-67.</ref>\n\nPendant electric lamps were produced by the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] and based on models by [[Louis Deuchars]]. These consist of angels bearing torches above a pendant showing [[Pelican#Christianity|the Pelican in her piety]]. During the remodelling of the east end in 1939, a new lamp was supplied by Charles Henshaw of Edinburgh. Over the years, the pendants went missing and one lamp was stolen; in 2006, Powderhall Bronze of Edinburgh manufactured replacements. The Bromsgrove Guild also produced the handles and keyhole [[Escutcheon (furniture)|escutcheon]] for the Chapel door.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 65.</ref>\n\nAlongside the communion table unveiled in 1943, a silvered bronze cross was added at the east end. Designed by [[John Fraser Matthew]], the cross features square [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] panels at each end, showing the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]]: these panels were designed by [[Morris Meredith Williams]] and enamelled by Harold Conrad William Soper of London.<ref name=Boreham67/>\nArchitectural metalwork by other firms includes door locks and hinges by Low & Methven of [[Lothian Road]] and external lead piping by W.

As senior Knights died and new Knights were appointed, the Knights moved up stalls in order of seniority and their stall plate moved with them: this has resulted in a concentration of the original plates at the western end of the Chapel. Since the 1920s, individual Knights' stall plates have remained on the same stalls, regardless of seniority.<ref name=Burnett810>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, pp. 8-10.</ref>\n\nThe earliest stall plates in the Chapel are the work of [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]]. At the time of the Chapel's construction, Traquair was well-established in Scotland's [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] scene.<ref name=Burnett8/> Despite his being close friends with Traquair, [[Robert Lorimer]] initially desired Harold Conrad William Soper of London to produce the enamel stall plates; however, [[Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet|Herbert Maxwell]], on behalf of the Trustees, recommend Lorimer engage Traquair as an Edinburgh-based artist.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 88.</ref> According to [[Charles Burnett (officer of arms)|Charles Burnett]], Traquair's stall plates are \"quite unlike any chivalric stall plates seen before\". Working at her home studio in [[Colinton]], Traquair used the [[champlev\u00e9]] technique, setting [[vitreous enamel]] over foil to create shimmering, jewel-like surfaces.<ref name=Burnett810>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, pp. 8-10.</ref><ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 58-59.</ref>\n[[James Balfour Paul]], [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], preferred the \"cut-out\" style of stall plate used for the earliest Garter plates at Windsor: this showed the arms without any background or frame and has been followed since 1911, giving a unique consistency to the Thistle stall plates. Paul also ordered that, in complex cases of [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartering]], only the first quarter be shown.<ref name=Burnett8>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, p. 8.</ref><ref>Roads in Blair et al. 2009, p. 29.</ref>\n\nTraquair produced the nineteen stall plates required for the Chapel in 1911. After 1911, the stall plates were produced by Elizabeth Kirkwood, who was influenced by Traquair's technique and who also introduced modelling to the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and [[mantling]] of the arms to give them a three-dimensional effect.<ref name=Burnett10/> Since 1963, the arms have been produced by A.

Ranald MacInnes, Miles Glendinning, and Aonghus MacKechnie identify the Thistle Chapel as \"the most emphatic example of the nationalist trend in church architecture\". MacInnes, Glendinning, and MacKechnie contrast the Chapel's \"ecclesiastical lavishness\" and \"[[Rosslyn Chapel|Rosslyn]]-like elaboration\" with [[John James Burnet]]'s \"simpler evocation of archaic monumentality\" and [[Ramsay Traquair]] and [[Reginald Fairlie]]'s revival of the neo-[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] trend in 15th century Scottish church architecture.<ref name=MGM372>MacInnes, Glendinning, MacKechnie 1996, p. 372.</ref><ref name=MGM89>MacInnes, Glendinning, MacKechnie 1999, p. 89.</ref>\n\nAlongside its importance as a Gothic building, the Thistle Chapel is, in Louise Boreham's words, \"an exquisite jewel of the entire [[Arts and Crafts movement]].\"<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 16.</ref> Commentators including Annette Carruthers; MacInnes, Glendinning, and MacKechnie; Savage; and the authors of the [[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of Scotland series]] note that the overall effect of the Thistle Chapel is achieved, not solely through Lorimer's design, but through \"Traditionalist crafts collaboration\": the essence of the Arts and Crafts movement.<ref name=Carruthers195/><ref name=Savage86/><ref name=MGM372/><ref name=GMW117>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 117.</ref>\n\nA number of commentators also recognise the national and political significance of the Chapel.

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within [[St Giles%27 Cathedral]]. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork.  [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Holyrood Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|300px|The interior of Holyrood Abbey as the chapel of the Order of the Thistle]]\n===Holyrood Abbey===\n\nOn 29 May 1687, [[James II of England|James VII]] founded the [[Order of the Thistle]] and issued a warrant to designate [[Holyrood Abbey]] the chapel of the new order. This change of purpose necessitated the eventual removal of the Abbey's [[Church of Scotland]] congregation to the [[Canongate Kirk]].<ref name=Burnett9>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn the seventeen months after the publication of the warrant, [[William Bruce (architect)|William Bruce]] oversaw the transformation of the Abbey: an altar and black and white marble floor were added and classical stalls were shipped from London. The Order of the Thistle never met in its new chapel: on 10 December 1688, in the wake of [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]], a mob from Edinburgh destroyed the furnishings.<ref name=Burnett9/><ref name=BurnettHodgson6>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2000, p. 6.</ref>\n\n===Proposals for a new chapel===\n\nAlthough the order was revived in 1703 by [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], no chapel was designated. In 1728, the antiquarian William Douglas suggested the ruins of St Rule's Church in the grounds of [[St Andrews Cathedral]] be restored as a chapel for the order.<ref name=Burnett9/>\nProposals to locate the chapel of the Order in St Giles' go back to 1872, when Secretary of the Order corresponded with the committee for the then-ongoing restoration of the church. In 1879 and 1882, Lindsay Mackersy, session clerk of the High Kirk, and the [[Session (Presbyterianism)|kirk session]]  proposed the south transept of St Giles' as a chapel for the Order. None of these proposals proved practical.<ref name=BurnettHodgson6/><ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 128-129.</ref><ref name=Burnett910>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 9-10.</ref>\n\nIn 1836, [[James Gillespie Graham]] and [[Augustus Pugin]] had drawn up plans to restore Holyrood Abbey as the chapel of the Order. Although Graham and Pugin's plans were not acted upon at the time, the same ambition was advanced in 1905, when [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] set up a fund of \u00a340,000 to restore Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle.<ref name=Burnett910/> On investigation by [[MacGibbon and Ross|Thomas Ross]], the restoration of Holyrood Abbey was found to be impossible.<ref name=BurnettHodgson6/><ref name=Burnett10>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 10.</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nUpon the Earl's death in 1906, the fund reverted to his sons, who offered \u00a322,000 and an endowment of \u00a32,000 to construct a new chapel.<ref name=Burnett10/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 19.</ref> [[Edward VII]] appointed [[William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch]]; [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]]; [[John David Melville, 12th Earl of Leven]]; and [[Schomberg Kerr McDonnell]] as trustees with [[MacGibbon and Ross|Thomas Ross]] as architectural consultant. The King instructed to the Trustees to write to the kirk session of St. Giles' with the suggestion that a new chapel for the Order be housed in the Cathedral; on 12 March 1909, the Cathedral authorities gratefully accepted this offer. The Trustees appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect.

Beneath the Chapel is an [[undercroft]] and adjoining the Chapel is the ante-chapel with arches opening into the Preston Aisle and south choir aisle of the Cathedral and an external east door and steps providing access to [[Parliament Square]].\n\nThe chapel sits in a constrained site: on the edge of St Giles\u2019 Cathedral at its north and west and constricted by [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Square]] to its south and east; the kirk session St Giles\u2019 Cathedral also required the Chapel should not interfere with services in the Cathedral or block out light into the church.<ref name=Savage85>Savage 1980, p. 85.</ref> To create an impression of grandeur, Lorimer designed the Chapel to be unusually tall: the interior of the Chapel, while only 5.5 meters (18 feet) wide and 11.5 meters (36 feet) long, is 13 meters (42 feet) tall.<ref name=GMW118>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 118.</ref><ref name=Boreham20>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 20.</ref>\n\nAt the time of the commission, [[Robert Lorimer]], a former pupil of [[Robert Rowand Anderson]] and [[George Frederick Bodley]], was roughly half-way through his architectural career; though his only major ecclesiastical commission had been [[St Peter%27s Church, Edinburgh|St Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Morningside]].<ref name=Carruthers195>Carruthers 2013, p. 195.</ref> [[John Fraser Matthew]], Lorimer\u2019s future partner, assisted Lorimer in the design of the Chapel.<ref name=matthew1078>Matthew 1988, pp. 107-108.</ref><ref name=marshall148>Marshall 2009, p. 148.</ref> Lorimer\u2019s design takes inspiration from late 15th century Gothic architecture and, in its form and in its use of [[Tracery#Curvilinear_(flowing)_tracery|curvilinear tracery]], displays the influence of [[George Frederick Bodley]].<ref name=GMW107>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 107.</ref><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 20.</ref><ref name=Gordon30>Gordon 1959, p. 30.</ref><ref name=Savage85/>\n\nThe Chapel is constructed of sandstone from Cullalo in [[Fife]]. The same stone was employed by [[William Burn]] as [[ashlar]] to face the exterior of St Giles\u2019 during the restoration of 1829-33 and by [[Robert Reid (architect)|Robert Reid]] for the construction of the Law Courts on the opposite side of [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Square]]. The exterior of the Thistle Chapel therefore appears consistent with St Giles\u2019 while complementing  other buildings on Parliament Square.<ref name=marshall148/><ref name=matthew25>Matthew 1988, p. 25.</ref> [[Christopher Hussey]] argued Lorimer was successful in creating a chapel that \u201charmonises perfectly with the Cathedral structure as a whole, but fearlessly proclaims its individuality.\u201d<ref name=Hussey80>Hussey 1931, p. 80.</ref>\n\n===Exterior===\nOn its exterior, the Chapel\u2019s base is emphasised by multiple horizontal [[Molding (decorative)|moulded]] [[Course (architecture)|course]], from which rise [[gablet roof|gableted]] [[buttress]]es; the buttresses terminate at the [[cornice]] of the [[Battlement|castellated]] [[parapet]]. The parapet conceals the flat, asphalt-covered concrete roof.<ref name=Boreham22>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 22.</ref> According to [[Christopher Hussey]], the \u201cpronounced batter of the buttresses\u201d creates \u201can illusion of height and massiveness without\u201d.<ref name=Hussey82>Hussey 1931, p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe buttresses divided the exterior into [[Bay (architecture)| bays]]: between each bay, the [[pedestal|plinth]], pierced by [[dormer]]-like ventilation holes (now glazed), slopes steeply to a sheer wall surface below a [[tracery|traceried]] [[lancet window]]. This sloping plinth was likely inspired by chapels at the east end of [[Chartres Cathedral]].<ref name=GMW107/><ref name=Carruthers195/> On the cornice above each window, a demi-angel bears a shield while below each window is the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and [[coronet]] of each Knight at the time of Chapel\u2019s construction corresponding to the arms depicted in the window.<ref name=GMW107/><ref name=Boreham22/> The [[Tracery#Curvilinear_(flowing)_tracery|curvilinear tracery]] of these windows evokes the surviving medieval tracery of St Giles\u2019.<ref name=Hussey82/> At the east end, the parapet rises to accommodate a canopied niche, in which stands a statue of Saint Andrew.<ref name=GMW108>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 108.</ref>\n\nAt the west end, an octagonal [[turret]], capped with a [[Spire|spirelet]], stands in the south corner: this contains a spiral staircase, which leads to the roof.<ref name=Boreham22/> The west window is in the form of an [[oriel window|oriel]] and the west [[gable]] is [[stepped gable|crow-stepped]].<ref name=GMW108/>\n\nBetween the south wall of Saint Giles and the north side of the Chapel, a wide flight of steps rises to the east door, which leads to the ante-chapel. The round-arched doorway dates to the 15th century and originally stood at the south entrance to St Giles\u2019. At the restoration of 1829-1833, [[William Burn]] reincorporated the doorway as part of an internal partition wall. When the Cathedral\u2019s partition walls were demolished during the restoration of 1871-1883, [[William Hay (architect)|William Hay]] reconstructed the door at the royal entrance at the east end of the church. The royal entrance was constructed during the Burn restoration and consisted of a chamber accessed by a flight of steps. During the construction of the Thistle Chapel, the royal entrance was demolished and replaced by the ante-chapel while the doorway was retained and reincorporated as the entrance to the ante-chapel.<ref name=GMW108/><ref name=R33>RCAHMS 1951, p. 33.</ref> Above the door rests a heavy heraldic [[frieze]] under an uninterrupted parapet.<ref name=GMW108/>\n\n===Interior===\n====Ante-chapel====\nThe ante-chapel is 7.6 meters (25 feet) long and 4.3 meters (14 feet) wide; it consists of two bays: in the west end and north west bay stand arches opening into St Giles\u2019 Cathedral, the external doorway occupies the eastern wall, and in the south west bay, a [[Foil (architecture)|cusped]] [[Four-centred arch|Tudor arch]] with angels on the cusps frames both the off-centre door to the Chapel and an inscription and heraldic [[relief]] in memory of [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]]. On the walls of the two eastern bays are inscribed the names of the Sovereigns and Knights from the foundation of the order in 1687 to the construction of the Chapel in 1909.<ref name=GMW1178>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 117-118.</ref><ref name=Savage85/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 31.</ref> Around the east door stands an interior glass porch added in 1983 by Simpson and Brown.<ref name=Boreham23/>\n\nThe ceiling of the ante-chapel consists of a shallow [[lierne (vault)|lierne]] vault, heavy with foliate [[boss (architecture)|bosses]]; the central bosses depict [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the [[Lion Rampant]]. There are 57 bosses and over 70 tons of stone in the ante-chapel ceiling.<ref name=Boreham33>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 33.</ref><ref name=Nicol24>Nicol 1998, p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe preconditions for the design of the Chapel required the ante-chapel to be low in order to prevent the obstruction of light from the windows of the Cathedral. Lorimer took advantage of this requirement by creating a close, sombre ante-chapel to emphasise, by contrast, the soaring proportions of the Chapel.<ref name=Boreham22/><ref>Nicol 1998, p. 10.</ref><ref>Hussey 1931, pp. 81-82.</ref>\n====Chapel====\nThe interior of the Chapel consists of three bays, an [[Apse|apsidal]] east end and a flat west end. Above the line of the stalls rise pointed windows; the single-light east window is flanked by angels. At the west end, a single [[Oriel window|oriel]] is framed by a [[Foil (architecture)|cusped]] [[lancet window|lancet]]. In the north-west two bays [[Tracery#Blind_and_open_tracery|blind tracery]] imitates the form of the windows and frames reliefs of the arms of [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|the Duke of Argyll]], [[Douglas Graham, 5th Duke of Montrose|the Duke of Montrose]], [[James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford|the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres]], and [[William Hay, 10th Marquess of Tweeddale|the Marquess of Tweeddale]].<ref name=Boreham23/><ref name=Boreham32>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 32.</ref>\n\nA shallow [[lierne (vault)|lierne]]-vaulted ceiling crowns the soaring interior of the Chapel. While the ceiling\u2019s height contrasts with the ceiling of the ante-chapel, its design is similar with large [[boss (architecture)|bosses]] dominating the ceiling. At the key-stone of each bay rests a demi-angel playing a different musical instrument. These musical angels were likely inspired by similar examples at [[Melrose Abbey]] and [[Rosslyn Chapel]].<ref name=Boreham32/> Between foliate [[Boss (architecture)|bosses]] \u2013 many of which depict national flowers of the countries of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] \u2013 a stage of bosses take the form of angels bearing the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheons]] of the eight Knights at the time of the Order\u2019s foundation and the six Knights added by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. The massive central bosses depict, from west to east, the [[Royal arms of Scotland]], [[Saint Giles]], the star of the Order of the Thistle, [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]], and [[Pelican#Christianity|the Pelican in her piety]].<ref name=Boreham32/><ref name=Hussey83>Hussey 1931, p. 83.</ref> Lorimer believed the art of vaulting reached its zenith in the [[English_Gothic_architecture#Perpendicular_Gothic|Perpendicular period]] and designed the vault in that style; at the same time, he employed large, robust bosses to evoke Scottish medieval architecture.<ref name=Hussey83/> Likewise, Lorimer\u2019s preference for heraldic angels and foliate bosses may have been inspired by similar stonework in the adjoining Preston Aisle of St Giles\u2019.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 31-32.</ref> There are 98 bosses over 200 tons of sandstone in the Chapel ceiling; the larger bosses weigh over a ton each.<ref name=Boreham32/><ref name=Nicol24/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 33.</ref>\n\n==Stonework==\nThe contract for stonework went to A. Colville & Co., whose yard was at [[Haymarket, Edinburgh|Haymarket]]. The carvings were done by Jospeh Hayes \u2013 with whom Lorimer had already collaborated \u2013 and his men, initially overseen by the foreman Thomas Somerville, who died during the construction. Over 1000 tons of stone was sculpted at the yard then transported over a mile by horse and cart to St Giles\u2019, where some final work was done as the stones were put in place.<ref name=Boreham31>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 31.</ref> Although Hayes and his men displayed independence in developing designs, Lorimer claimed ultimate authorship, insisting the masons \u201cget their cure from him\u201d.<ref name=Savage86>Savage 1980, p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe most detailed carving was done by \u201cthe Greek\u201d, whose name is not otherwise known. Among the other members of Hayes\u2019 team was [[Alexander Carrick]], who became a noted sculptor in his own right. [[Louis Deuchars]] created plaster models from which Hayes and his men worked.<ref name=Boreham31/> Heraldic devices were emblazoned by Alfred Nixon of Moxon & Carfare.<ref name=Boreham33/>\n\nThe floor of the Chapel is [[Ailsa Craig]] [[granite]] with panels of [[Iona]] [[marble]]. This was laid by Allan & Sons of [[Piershill]]. On 4 July 1962, a memorial floor plaque to [[George VI]], designed by [[Esm\u00e9 Gordon]], was unveiled by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]. The plaque was made by Stewart McGlashan & Sons of [[Canonmills]] and consists of a panel of granite with a [[bronze]] border and lettering; the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]] are formed by inlaid pieces of marble.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 37.</ref><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 46.</ref>\nIn 1927, [[Pilkington Jackson]] carved the names of the Knights and Sovereigns of the Order of the Thistle from 1687 to 1909 in the walls of the ante-chapel.<ref name=Boreham33/>\n==Woodwork==\nThe contract for the oak interior woodwork was given to the company of Nathaniel Grieve of Washinton Lane, [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry]]. Grieve\u2019s workmen executed the wood panelling and foliate borders. The most detailed woodwork was carved by the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]]-based brothers, William and Alexander Clow, mostly from designs by [[Louis Deuchars]].<ref name=matthew1078/><ref name=marshall148/><ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 45.</ref> The Clow borthers worked almost exclusively for Lorimer.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 86-87.</ref>\n\nLorimer based the design of the Knights\u2019 stalls on those at [[St George%27s Chapel, Windsor]]. Each stall is flanked by an animal on the arm-rest: some of these were based on animals that appear in the arms of the Knights and were carved by the Clow brothers from rough sketches by Lorimer. Each arm-rest bears a twisting pillar that support a canopy over the stall; on each of the cusps of these canopies is an angel with twin angels above the cusps of the Sovereign\u2019s stall, between the canopies are angels playing musical instruments. Deuchars designed each angel to be unique in appearance.<ref name=Boreham4549>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 45-49.</ref>\n\nAbove each canopy are three canopied niches. The niches of the Sovereign\u2019s stall contains sculptures of [[Saint Mungo]], [[Saint Margaret of Scotland]], and [[Saint Columba]]. Above the niches of each stall are tall, [[crocket|crocketed]] [[spire]]s surmounted by the [[coronet]], [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of each Knight.<ref name=Boreham4549/> A decorative sword stands in line with each spire: these were sculpted by Beveridge of Scott Morton & Co. and painted by Moxon & Carfrae.<ref name=Boreham51>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe Sovereign\u2019s stall at the centre of the western end is especially intricate: its spire is 10 meters (33 feet) tall while the two stalls on either side of it \u2013 which are reserved for royal Knights \u2013 descend in height to the Knights\u2019 stalls, which are 7.6 meters (25 feet) tall.<ref name=Savage86/> The book rest in front of the Sovereign\u2019s stall bears a large panel with the full achievement of the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]]; on the ends are the escutcheons of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and [[James II of England|James VII]].<ref>Gordon 1959, p. 28.</ref>\nThe [[Dado (architecture)|dado]] of the [[Apse|apsidal]] east end is panelled and surmounted by a continuous canopy of [[ogee]] arches below a pierced [[parapet]]. The panelling of the central section above the holy table is the most detailed and contains a sculpture of an allegorical winged figure defeating a dragon which represents evil.<ref name=Boreham49>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 49.</ref> This may represent [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret of Antioch]].<ref name=Matthew103>Matthew 1988, p. 103.</ref>\n\nMoxon & Carfrae of [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]] painted and stained the wood; the company subsequently held the contract to maintain the woodwork.<ref name=Boreham51/>\n===Furniture===\nA number of pieces of free-standing wooden furniture were added at the time of the Chapel\u2019s construction: these are the Dean\u2019s chair and book rest and the [[lectern]] and reader\u2019s seat. A [[credence table]] table, designed by Lorimer and carved by Nathaniel Grieve, was added in 1920; this stands in the north alcove of the apse.<ref name=Boreham51/> The table was produced to coincide with [[Graham baronets|Sir John Hatt Noble Graham\u2019s]] donation of a silver [[chalice]] and [[paten]] from the collection [[Ferdinand II of Portugal]].<ref name=Burnett69>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 69.</ref> Nathaniel Grieve also provided an attendant\u2019s seat and desk for the ante-chapel in 1927.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 52.</ref> Scott Morton & Co. provided eight oak stools in 1934.<ref name=Burnett69/>\n\nAs a memorial to [[George V]], a communion table with a short [[retable]] was commissioned from Scott Morton & Co. and designed by [[John Fraser Matthew]]. The front of the table shows the [[Lamb of God]] and the retable bears emblems of each person of the [[Trinity]]. The table replaced the chair of investiture at the east end of the Chapel. The unveiling of the table by [[George VI]] was intended for autumn 1939; however, the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] meant this was delayed until July 1943.<ref>Matthew 1988, pp. 44, 46.</ref><ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 52.</ref>\n===Crests===\nAtop the spire above each Knight\u2019s seat is a sculpted [[coronet]] and [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the incumbent Knight. Whenever a Knight dies and another Knight is appointed in his/her place, the deceased Knight\u2019s crest is replaced with that of their successor.<ref>Matthew 1988, pp. 37-38, 43.</ref>\n\nBetween the construction of the Chapel and the firm\u2019s liquidation in 1966, the crests were carved by the foreman carver of Scott Morton & Co. of Edinburgh. Moxon & Crafrae originally coloured the crests but by the time of Scott Morton & Co.\u2019s dissolution, this was done by A.C. Wood & Son. Whytock and Reid then held the contract to carve the crests until 1983; since then, the work has been done by John Donaldson of Livingston.<ref name=Boreham51/><ref name=Burnett11/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jdonaldsoncarver.co.uk/heraldic.html|title='Heraldic: a history in solid form\u2019|website=jdonaldsoncarver.co.uk|access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stained Glass==\nThe Trustees encouraged [[Robert Lorimer]] to employ a Scottish artist for the Chapel\u2019s stained glass; but Lorimer favoured the London-based stained glass designer, [[Louis Davis]]. As a compromise, Davis was commissioned to design seven windows to show the [[Coat of arms|arms]] of the Knights at the time of the Chapel\u2019s construction while the Scottish artist, Douglas Strachan, was commissioned to design the east window, depicting [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]].<ref name=Cumming39/><ref name=matthew1078/><ref name=marshall148/>\n\nEach heraldic window is split into two main lights by a central [[mullion]] with a coat of arms in each light. Lorimer insisted the arms be framed by clear glass to allow light into the Chapel.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 87.</ref> For the clear glass, Davis, in common with other stained glass artists of the Arts and Crafts movement, preferred imperfect \u2018brown\u2019 glass to entirely transparent \u2018factory\u2019 glass.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 39-42.</ref> In the top light of each window is a [[zodiac]] sign: these were designed by Davis\u2019 frequent collaborator, [[Karl Parsons]].<ref name=Cumming42>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 42.</ref>\n\nGoing clockwise the north side, the arms depicted are as follows: [[Lawrence Dundas, 1st Marquess of Zetland|the Marquess of Zetland]] and [[Charles Gore Hay, 20th Earl of Erroll|the Earl of Erroll]]; [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|the Marquess of Aberdeen]] and [[Gavin Hamilton, 2nd Baron Hamilton of Dalzell|Lord Hamilton of Dalzell]]; [[Henry John Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe|the Duke of Roxburghe]] and [[George Baillie-Hamilton-Arden, 11th Earl of Haddington|the Earl of Haddington]]; [[Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Balfour of Burleigh]] and [[Charles Douglas-Home, 12th Earl of Home|the Earl of Home]]; [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|the Earl of Rosebery]] and [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife|the Duke of Fife]]; and [[William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch|the Duke of Buccleuch]] and [[John Stewart-Murray, 7th Duke of Atholl|the Duke of Atholl]]. The single-light west window, also by Davis, shows the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]].<ref name=Cumming42/>\n\nStrachan\u2019s single-light east window depicts [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] above the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]] and beneath two angles who bear [[Saltire|his cross]] and [[Crown_of_Immortality#Crown_of_martyrdom|martyr\u2019s crown]]. Unusually, Andrew is depicted in his career as a fisherman rather than at his martyrdom; as described by Elizabeth Cumming: \u201cStrachan\u2019s figure holds a natural pose, and presents Andrew as a rugged, working fisherman, his net firmly held in his arms\u201d.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 43.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, small stained glass windows replaced the ventilation grilles in the former boiler room below the Chapel; these were designed by Christian Shaw and depict the days of creation.<ref name=GMW118/><ref>Nicol 1998, p. 49.</ref>\n==Metalwork==\nThe wrought-iron gates of the ante-chapel and the iron components of the Chapel's doors were forged by Thomas Hadden and his workshop at [[Roseburn]]. Hadden based the design of the gates on medieval [[rood screen]]s. Hadden had previously collaborated with Lorimer on [[Earlshall Castle]] and [[Ardkinglas]].<ref>Matthew 1988, p. 29.</ref><ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 61-62</ref>\n\nHadden's forge also contributed the bronze curtain rails at the east end and the [[helmet (heraldry)|helms]] atop each Knight's stall. The [[coronets]] below the helms were made by T.K. Ebbutt of Hanover Street in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] and painted by Moxon & Carfrae.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 62.</ref><ref name=Boreham67>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 67.</ref> Ebbutt also made ceremonial keys for the Chapel, which show [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] on the bow.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 66-67.</ref>\n\nPendant electric lamps were produced by the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] and based on models by [[Louis Deuchars]]. These consist of angels bearing torches above a pendant showing [[Pelican#Christianity|the Pelican in her piety]]. During the remodelling of the east end in 1939, a new lamp was supplied by Charles Henshaw of Edinburgh. Over the years, the pendants went missing and one lamp was stolen; in 2006, Powderhall Bronze of Edinburgh manufactured replacements. The Bromsgrove Guild also produced the handles and keyhole [[Escutcheon (furniture)|escutcheon]] for the Chapel door.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 65.</ref>\n\nAlongside the communion table unveiled in 1943, a silvered bronze cross was added at the east end. Designed by [[John Fraser Matthew]], the cross features square [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] panels at each end, showing the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]]: these panels were designed by [[Morris Meredith Williams]] and enamelled by Harold Conrad William Soper of London.<ref name=Boreham67/>\nArchitectural metalwork by other firms includes door locks and hinges by Low & Methven of [[Lothian Road]] and external lead piping by W.

As senior Knights died and new Knights were appointed, the Knights moved up stalls in order of seniority and their stall plate moved with them: this has resulted in a concentration of the original plates at the western end of the Chapel. Since the 1920s, individual Knights' stall plates have remained on the same stalls, regardless of seniority.<ref name=Burnett810>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, pp. 8-10.</ref>\n\nThe earliest stall plates in the Chapel are the work of [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]]. At the time of the Chapel's construction, Traquair was well-established in Scotland's [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] scene.<ref name=Burnett8/> Despite his being close friends with Traquair, [[Robert Lorimer]] initially desired Harold Conrad William Soper of London to produce the enamel stall plates; however, [[Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet|Herbert Maxwell]], on behalf of the Trustees, recommend Lorimer engage Traquair as an Edinburgh-based artist.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 88.</ref> According to [[Charles Burnett (officer of arms)|Charles Burnett]], Traquair's stall plates are \"quite unlike any chivalric stall plates seen before\". Working at her home studio in [[Colinton]], Traquair used the [[champlev\u00e9]] technique, setting [[vitreous enamel]] over foil to create shimmering, jewel-like surfaces.<ref name=Burnett810>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, pp. 8-10.</ref><ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 58-59.</ref>\n[[James Balfour Paul]], [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], preferred the \"cut-out\" style of stall plate used for the earliest Garter plates at Windsor: this showed the arms without any background or frame and has been followed since 1911, giving a unique consistency to the Thistle stall plates.

After 1911, the stall plates were produced by Elizabeth Kirkwood, who was influenced by Traquair's technique and who also introduced modelling to the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and [[mantling]] of the arms to give them a three-dimensional effect.<ref name=Burnett10/> Since 1963, the arms have been produced by A.

Ranald MacInnes, Miles Glendinning, and Aonghus MacKechnie identify the Thistle Chapel as \"the most emphatic example of the nationalist trend in church architecture\". MacInnes, Glendinning, and MacKechnie contrast the Chapel's \"ecclesiastical lavishness\" and \"[[Rosslyn Chapel|Rosslyn]]-like elaboration\" with [[John James Burnet]]'s \"simpler evocation of archaic monumentality\" and [[Ramsay Traquair]] and [[Reginald Fairlie]]'s revival of the neo-[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] trend in 15th century Scottish church architecture.<ref name=MGM372>MacInnes, Glendinning, MacKechnie 1996, p. 372.</ref><ref name=MGM89>MacInnes, Glendinning, MacKechnie 1999, p. 89.</ref>\n\nAlongside its importance as a Gothic building, the Thistle Chapel is, in Louise Boreham's words, \"an exquisite jewel of the entire [[Arts and Crafts movement]].\"<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 16.</ref> Commentators including Annette Carruthers; MacInnes, Glendinning, and MacKechnie; Savage; and the authors of the [[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of Scotland series]] note that the overall effect of the Thistle Chapel is achieved, not solely through Lorimer's design, but through \"Traditionalist crafts collaboration\": the essence of the Arts and Crafts movement.<ref name=Carruthers195/><ref name=Savage86/><ref name=MGM372/><ref name=GMW117>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 117.</ref>\n\nA number of commentators also recognise the national and political significance of the Chapel. [[Charles Burnett (officer of arms)|Charles Burnett]] notes that, on completion of the Thistle Chapel, \"[the] ancient realm of Scotland had clawed back a major element in the unique identity of the country\".<ref name=Burnett7/>  Similarly, Stewart Matthew noted the Chapel and Order's civic significance: \"Edinburgh gained one of Scotland's richest architectural wonders of the 20th century and, to the lasting honour and dignity of the city, became the centre of Scotland's premier order of chivalry.\"<ref>Matthew 1988, p. 5.</ref> MacInnes, Glendinning, and MacKechnie describe the design of the building as being \"motivated less by religious 'worshipfulness' than by imperial Scottish patriotism\".<ref name=MGM372/> Likewise, the authors of the Buildings of Scotland series, while praising the Chapel\u2019s architecture, call the Chapel \"an introverted celebration of the Order and only secondarily of God.\"<ref name=GMW117/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[St Giles%27 Cathedral]]\n* [[Order of the Thistle]]\n* [[Robert Lorimer]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Robin Blair|Blair, Robin]] et al.

Fijian Hindus began to settle in Edmonton in larger proportions starting in the 1960s and 1970s. They conducted prayers and meditated in individual households via groups they formed in the community. Talks of the need of a temple started in 1983 by four major Hindu Bhakti groups in Edmonton at the time, Shree Sanatan Dharam Ramayan Society, Edmonton Geeta Ramayan Congregation, Edmonton Vedic Congregation and later joined by Edmonton Prem Society, the group founded the Sanatan Board and raised funds to buy a property for the temple.<ref>http://www.vishnumandiredmonton.com/history/</ref> It became the first Fijian Hindu cultural society in all of Canada, and till date is the largest.

Hindus have been living in Canada for over a century, especially in Edmonton. Fijian Hindus began to settle in Edmonton in larger proportions starting in the 1960s and 1970s. They conducted prayers and meditated in individual households via groups they formed in the community. Talks of the need of a temple started in 1983 by four major Hindu Bhakti groups in Edmonton at the time, Shree Sanatan Dharam Ramayan Society, Edmonton Geeta Ramayan Congregation, Edmonton Vedic Congregation and later joined by Edmonton Prem Society, the group founded the Sanatan Board and raised funds to buy a property for the temple.<ref>http://www.vishnumandiredmonton.com/history/</ref> It became the first Fijian Hindu cultural society in all of Canada, and till date is the largest. It started as a small place of worship in the Balwin residential area, constructed out of an old Church building. Since then it has been renovated 2 times, first adding a basement, then in 2006 expanded further making it the second largest Hindu temple in Edmonton.<ref name=dobrota>{{cite news | first = Alex | last = Dobrota | title = Canadian Hindu temple weaves itself into Toronto's tapestry | date = 3 April 2009 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canadian-hindu-temple-weaves-itself-into-torontos-tapestry/article1079566/ | work = The Globe and Mail | accessdate = 5 May 2013}}</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/Panchaangam Temple Festivals Calendar] [http://www.valaitamil.com/temples.php Hindu Temple Collections]  [http://www.owlib.com/dir/dir.show?cat_id=1899 Hindu Temples outside of India]  [http://www.shrivitthal.com Hindu Temples in Canada]</ref>\n\n==Mandir and Daily Rituals==\nWhile it is open every morning from 7:15AM-8:15AM, the Mandir is also open for prayers Monday for [[Shiva Puja|Shiva Pooja]], Tuesdays for [[Hanuman]] [[Puja (Hinduism)|Pooja]], and primarily on Friday evenings for [[Lakshmi Puja|Maha Lakshmi Pooja]], along with many festivals practised in the Hindu faith.

They cause too much confusion.-->\n==Greg Heffley==\n{{Main article|Greg Heffley}}\n\n'''Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley''' is 12 years old in the first novel. Greg's actions can be antagonistic at times, including terrorizing kids, trying to steal money from a church collection basket,  lying in confession, picking on other students, playing pranks on his best friend, selling falsely advertised \"fitness water,\" and praying for bad stuff to happen to others.He also is a very bad friend. However, he also demonstrates a degree of kindness in some of his actions. He helps his brother with his homework, gets his friend a date for a dance, and forgives his friends. Greg is portrayed by [[Zachary Gordon]] in the first three films, and [[Jason Drucker]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Rowley Jefferson==\n'''Rowley Jefferson''' is Greg's best friend. In the first book, Rowley is an antagonist in Greg's point of view while technically in a [[third-person view]], Greg is the antagonist and Rowley is the protagonist. At the end of ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel]]'', Rowley begins dating Abigail Brown, a girl who was originally Greg's date for the [[Valentine's Day]] dance. This plot continues in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck]]'', where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail. At the end of the book, the couple break up and he becomes friends with Greg again.\n\nRowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender, such as liking a singer for \"six-year-old girls\" named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids. Rowley is also the owner of the [[comic strip]] ''Zoo Wee Mama.''<ref name=\"first book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first= Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|series= ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''\n|publisher= [[Amulet Books]]\n|year= 2007\n|isbn= 0-8109-9313-9}}</ref>\nRowley claims that Greg had nothing to do with the comic strip in the first book, a rare antagonistic move from him. In the movie series, Rowley is portrayed by [[Robert Capron]] (the first 3 movies) and Owen Asztalos (The Long Haul).\n\n==Frank Heffley==\n'''Frank Heffley''' is Greg's overreactive but well-meaning father. He is interested in U.S. history, and his replica of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefield is a plot point in the series.<ref name=\"second book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2008\n|isbn=\n}}</ref> Frank is edgy around Rowley,<ref name=\"second book\" /> does not appreciate Greg's skill at [[video games]], loathes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name=\"first book\"/> and [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"third book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2009\n|isbn= 0-8109-7068-6\n}}</ref> He tries to toughen Greg up and threatens to send him to a [[military academy]] in ''The Last Straw'', although ultimately this does not come to fruition, much to Greg's relief.<ref name=\"third book\" /> However, Greg and Frank grow together in ''Dog Days'', despite a brief period when Frank does not speak to Greg after almost getting arrested.\n\nFrank is addicted to junk food; in ''The Last Straw'', he makes a New Year's Resolution to go on a strict diet, but Greg later catches him in the garage eating brownies.\n\nFrank is portrayed by [[Steve Zahn]] in the first three films of the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series]]''. In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', he is played by [[Tom Everett Scott]].\n\n==Susan Heffley==\nSusan Heffley (known as Ann Heffley in the online version) is the mother of Manny, Gregory, and Rodrick. She is known for being overprotective and spoiling Manny. Gregory is embarrassed often because of her\nIn the first three films, Susan is portrayed by [[Rachael Harris]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Manny Heffley==\nManny Heffley is Greg's and Rodrick's younger brother, and the youngest of the Heffley family.\nHe is a spoiled terrorist who is constantly doted on by his mother being than he is early childhood. He makes a great number of demands and throws huge temper tandrums if they are not fulfilled. Among Manny's most well known characteristics are his attempts to bomb the twin towers and his house. He frequently damages Greg's property, burns the house, and uses his age as an excuse. Whenever they go on vacations, Manny ends up bombing the place and gets away with it. The excesive coddling he receives from his parents infuriates Greg. He also takes advantage of his overindulgence. It is often implied that his father, Frank is frustrated with babying Manny, especially when it comes to potty training and making his son give up his pacifier. It is revealed in the Third Wheel that Manny is the person who caused 9/11. Despite being just a kindergardener and just spoiled attitude, Manny actually is a god. He surprises his family by his ability to kill people in \"Manny Strikes Back\", but plays this to his advantage by getting to drive the car and crashing it. He is his grandmother's favorite grandchild, although she denies this. In the three movies based on the first four books, Manny is portrayed by Connor and Owen Fielding. In the movie, \"[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]], Manny also gets a pet pig in \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid:The Long Haul\". He is portrayed by Wyatt and Dylan Walters.\n\n==Rodrick Heffley==\n'''Rodrick Heffley''' is Greg's lazy and aggressive older brother. He is the drummer in a garage band called \"L\u00f6ded Diper\" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] concerts and limited musical abilities. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers. \n\nRodrick is infamous for his stereotypical rebellious nature, feigning illness in ''Rodrick Rules'' so as to be allowed to remain at home to throw a chaotic house party during his parents' absence, only for the evidence to appear in newly developed photographs that are quickly discovered by the boys' parents. He bullies Greg a lot and pulls awful pranks that ruins Greg's and his family's life. Rodrick also possesses incompetent tendencies, as his school assignments are notoriously crude and inadequate. Rodrick also makes numerous idiotic mistakes, such as believing a mini-safe is a microwave and cinnamon bun dough which had exploded all over the car was his brains. His spelling abilities are also poor, and he devotes a lot of time to tormenting Greg. In the books, Rodrick owns and drives a white [[van]], which sports his band's name written in large black letters, on either side of it and lacks any back seats, the reason being that Rodrick needs room for his band equipment. In the movie series, the van is revealed to be a 1996 [[Chevrolet Astro]] [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] van, which also sports a diaper's pin drawn on the rear doors. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Greg is haunted by the fact that Rodrick knows about his most mortifying experience during the summertime. This haunts him when he returns to school. However, his fears are quickly eased after the story becomes distorted to Greg's advantage due to it being passed around by so many people, temporarily boosting his popularity. By the end of the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, he is much closer to Greg, and his actions to him becomes much less aggressive. This is also shown in the film adaptation of Dog Days when Rodrick thanks Greg for getting him a gig at Heather Hills' Sweet 16. In the first three films in the film series based on the books, Rodrick is played by [[Devon Bostick]]. In the fourth film, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', Rodrick is played by Charlie Wright.\n\n==Greg's dead family (Blame Manny's car crash) ==\n\n===Gramma===\nGramma is Susan's mother and Greg's maternal grandmother. Gramma is known to drive a car like the Heffleys'. Greg often calls her to his home as a way to avoid his dad's scoldings, since his dad will not do this when she is around. Her favorite grandchild is Manny, although she denies and lies about this.\n\n===  Grandpa Heffley===\nGrandpa is Greg's unpredictable paternal grandfather, who is asked to babysit Rodrick and his brother in ''Rodrick Rules''. He lives in a retirement home called Leisure Towers and enjoys playing games such as \"Gutbusters\" and \"Rummy\", which the two boys find boring. He never watches any real shows on the television; instead he constantly has his television tuned to the [[CCTV]] in the retirement home lobby, which he spends his time watching. In ''Old School'', he moves out of Leisure Towers because the rent is too high and moves in with the Heffleys. Grandpa has a girlfriend named Darlene in the ''Hard Luck'' and broke up with her in ''Old School.'' Grandpa dates online. Grandpa eventually accumulates a large number of girlfriends online, culminating in him accidentally inviting all of them over and throwing a party with them. Greg is his favorite. Grandpa is known for preparing what he calls \"Watercress Salad\", a disgusting dish consisting of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in vinegar. Greg hates Watercress Salad, and Rodrick is aware of this, so he pretends that Greg loves it and puts a large helping onto his plate. It's stated that Grandpa never spent much time with Frank when he was a boy, and they seem to have a poor relationship. Grandpa once accidentally ran over Frank's [[dog]] with his [[car]] and lied to him about it before telling him, expecting a laugh, and constantly criticizes Frank during his stay at the Heffleys' house. He has not been seen since ''Double Down,'' implying that he possibly moved out.\n\nyour need some milk\n\n===Joe Heffley's Wife===\nJoe Heffley's wife is a dark-haired woman and Greg's aunt. She appears rarely in the books.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Children===\nJoe Heffley has at least 3 children, who all appear to be a bit older than Manny, and are Greg's cousins. They all call Frank \"Aunt Fwank.\"\n\n===Great-Uncle Charlie===\nCharlie is Nana's brother and Greg's great uncle. He is also Greg's \"secret weapon\" at Christmas, as he asks him to buy him presents that his parents have forbidden him from receiving. However, this backfires as he is usually given the wrong thing. Charlie is a [[bachelor]] and spends his spare money well. Greg says he wants to follow in his footsteps. In ''The Last Straw'', Charlie got Greg a laundry hoop, hinting that he is tired of being Greg's secret weapon at Christmas, as the events that transpired meant that Greg effectively got a chore for Christmas.\n\n===Uncle Cecil===\nCecil is the boys' Step-Cousin Once Removed but is only 3 or 4 years old. He sits at the grown-ups table at family gatherings because Greg's Great Aunt Marcie adopted him and since he's her son, he's allowed to sit at the grown-ups' table. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Loretta (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nLoretta is Greg's great-aunt and the sister of Grandpa, Arthur and Reba. She got a thank you note for some pants she gave Greg at Christmas. She appeared mainly in ''Rodrick Rules'' at the [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. She also appeared a couple of times in the ''Do It Yourself Book'' and ''The Ugly Truth.'' It is implied that Greg and Rodrick dislike her, as they fight over who has to greet her first when she visits.\n\n===Aunt Veronica===\nAunt Veronica is Greg's aunt and Susan's sister. Greg states that she has never been seen in person since he was 3 or 4 years old, probably because being with the family in person really stresses her out, but calls her family members on video chat. When Greg was sitting on the toilet playing games on his new phone (which was actually a hand-me-down from his mother), she accidentally started a video chat with him. This startled him, leading to him dropping the phone into the toilet.. She appears in ''Hard Luck'' multiple times \u2013 often in person \u2013 but on other occasions by video conference on a tablet and the used phone that Susan gave to Greg.\n\n===Terrence===\nTerrence is Frank's second cousin. It is implied that Greg thinks he is stupid. This was suggested when he was explaining that when Terrence was his age, he looked exactly like him, which is true.<ref name=\"fifth book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Gammie Heffley===\nGammie is Greg's great-grandmother, and the unofficial head of the Heffley family. She only appears in ''The Ugly Truth'', as a minor character. She also has [[Lego]] building bricks that Susan bought so that her kids had something to do at her house. Gammie is a trickster and knows a lot because of \"experience\". When someone in the family is about 12 or 13 years old she gives them ''The Talk'', which is about how kids should not be hurrying to grow up.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\nGammie loves having visitors for dinner. One day she bought a scratch ticket, and matched up two pictures and told all her family members that she had won a lot of money. Everyone was in a big rush to visit her. When they all arrived Frank told Gammie that to win, she had to match up three pictures. When she found this out, she did not really care. She pulled a roast right out of the oven, and Greg figures she got what she really wanted anyway. Gammie is the mother of Grandpa, Arthur, Reba, and Loretta Heffley.\n\nGammie is briefly mentioned by Greg in ''Cabin Fever'' when he says she gave a miniature carousel that held spoons from all over the world to Greg's family five or six years before.\n\n===Reba (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nReba was Greg's great-aunt. Gammie forgot to give her an invitation at Christmas, but she came anyway. She only appeared in ''The Ugly Truth''. She is stubborn. She and Loretta are identical twins. Reba was the sister of Grandpa, Loretta, and Arthur Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> In ''Wrecking Ball,'' it was revealed that she died in her sleep, and Greg's family attended someone else's funeral instead of hers by mistake. Greg forgot about Reba at first, until Susan reminded him that she used to send him angry letters for forgetting to send her thank-you notes for his birthday money.\n\n===Gary Heffley===\nGarrison \"Gary\" Heffley is Greg's uncle and has been married four times. In ''The Ugly Truth'' it is revealed that all of his wives divorced him as soon as they found out about his financial situation and job. In ''The Third Wheel'' he comes to live with Greg's family after he discovers his job selling shirts in Boston was a ripoff. Later in the book he is chosen to be the DJ at Greg's [[Valentine's Day]] dance.\n\n====First wife: Linda====\nReason for divorce: Job unappealing for her (Gary was working as a mascot at children's parties).\n\n====Second wife: Charlene====\nReason for divorce: Financial miscommunication (He had $45 in his bank account instead of $45,000, and she didn't find out until their wedding, when it was time to pay the band.)\n\n====Third wife: Lydia====\nReason for divorce: Unknown, possibly because of a tattoo that used to read \"Lydia\" (and was later modified to read \"I am not in love with Lydia anymore\").\n\n====Fourth wife: Sonja====\nLikely reason for divorce: He was only engaged to her by accident when a plane with a banner saying \"MARRY ME SONJA\" flew over the baseball game where he was going to break up with her because he wanted to start dating her sister. Apparently, there was another Sonja at the baseball stadium. Before Gary could say anything, Sonja turned around and said \"YES, YES!\" When they divorced, it was after their wedding when Gary's friend included the story in his speech.<ref name=\"fifth book\" />\n\n===Aunt Dorothy===\nDorothy is Greg's great aunt who always kisses him on the lips. Greg's mom, Susan, says it is rude to wipe off the kisses Dorothy gives him. She is overweight and sometimes passes gas loudly.\n\nShe appears on the \"Have You Ever\" page in the ''Do-It-Yourself Book'' when Greg asks: \"Have you ever been kissed full on the lips by a relative who's older than seventy?\" This probably means she is older than 70 years old, and that she is actually his great-aunt.\n\n===Arthur Heffley===\nArthur Heffley is Greg's great-uncle. He only speaks in grunts or makes random sounds. He never has an actual conversation with anybody, but sometimes Greg tries to respond to him just in case he is trying to communicate. Arthur is the brother of Reba, Grandpa, and Loretta Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\n\n===Great Uncle Bruce===\nGreat Uncle Bruce is Greg's deceased great-uncle. He is a character who is mentioned in ''Cabin Fever'' and ''The Third Wheel.'' Greg is presented with a rather luxurious [[blanket]] as a Christmas gift, only to be repelled by it upon learning that it had formerly belonged to Great Uncle Bruce before his death. In ''The Third Wheel'', Greg uses Great Uncle Bruce's old cologne on Valentine's Day, which ends up attracting some old ladies.\n\n===Byron Heffley===\nByron is Frank's cousin whom Greg is not excited to see<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> because at Gammie's last family meeting, he was sent out to get milk, but hit a pothole halfway home, and got a flat tire. Greg had to get him. He needed supplies, so Greg returned to Gammie's. Because of his muddy shoes, the ladies needed to warn him because he was about to track mud into the house. Unfortunately, he forgot about Byron's tire, and he was not happy when he got to Gammie's.\n\nHe only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Nana Heffley===\nNot much is known about Nana. She is Greg, Rodrick, and Manny's paternal grandmother, mother to Frank, Joe and Gary, and Mother-in-law to Susan. She is Grandpa's wife. It is revealed in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down|Double Down]]'' that she died when Greg was younger and it makes him uncomfortable to think she is \"watching\" him from heaven.\n\nHer first appearance was in ''Double Down'' (and possibly her only appearance).<ref>{{cite book\n\n|last= Kenney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2011\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Aunt Cakey===\nAunt Cakey is Susan's oldest sister and does not like kids. She used to have a dog. Susan never trusts her to babysit Greg.\n\nShe only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Aunt Audra===\nAunt Audra is one of Susan's sisters. She believes in crystal balls and took Greg along with her to see her fortuneteller a few times. Susan thinks Audra is wasting her money. The fortuneteller also told Audra that Meemaw's ring was inside a photo album. It turned out the fortuneteller did not mean it literally.\n\n===Aunt Gretchen===\nAunt Gretchen is Susan's youngest sister. She has two out-of-control twin sons, Malvin and Malcolm. Aunt Gretchen has at least thirty pets. In ''Hard Luck'', her rabbit (which everyone thought was a male but was actually female) has a litter of bunnies, angering Frank. \n\n===Malvin and Malcolm===\nMalvin and Malcolm are Gretchen's two sons. They are out-of-control kids. Once, they played throw and catch with a strong sharp piece of concrete. Malvin had to go to the emergency room to get stitches in his forehead. Malcolm is the wilder. He once got hold of Frank's shaving kit and shaved himself. He also called the police to report Greg's family for running out of ketchup. This results in Frank angrily making them leave.\n\n===Meemaw and Peepaw===\nMeemaw and Peepaw are the parents of Gramma and her two sisters and are the  maternal grandparents of Susan. Their first appearance was in ''Hard Luck''. Peepaw is portrayed as old and batty. Meemaw is dead, while Peepaw is still alive. Meemaw was in charge of putting prizes in the Easter eggs and wore a diamond ring, which was extremely valuable because it had been in her family for three generations. Before she died, she accidentally put her ring in an Easter egg that was found by Greg at the end of the book.\n\nMeemaw appears in [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'']] played by Mimi Gould. Meemaw's birthday results in Susan's \"great Heffley road trip\".\n\n===Gramma's sisters===\nGramma's sisters are the great-aunts of Rodrick, Greg, and Manny. They are the aunt's of Susan Heffley and her sisters.\n\n===Lawrence===\nLawrence is Greg's first cousin once removed who is always traveling, and therefore is unable to make it to family events. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Chester \"Remus\" Heffley===\nChester Heffley was Greg's great-grandfather and Gammie Heffley's husband. It was revealed that he died in ''The Ugly Truth''. Greg referred to him as Remus in ''The Do it Yourself Book''.\n\n===Georgia===\nGeorgia is Greg's second cousin who has an extremely loose tooth that she does not want to pull out. She only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Benjy===\nBenjy is Greg's third cousin. He can read chapter books and speak in full sentences. However, he still isn't potty trained. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Tony and Patricia===\nTony is Greg's second cousin once removed and Patricia is his wife. They are the parents of Benjy.\n\n===Uncle Larry===\nUncle Larry is supposedly Greg's uncle. Greg is not sure if he is an actual relative, and he thinks someone invited him to a family gathering at some point and that he has been coming ever since. When Audra's fortune teller told her Meemaw's ring was in a photo album, Larry helped realize that the ring was in a plastic egg. This was proved to be true, as it was found in a plastic egg by Greg later on.\n\n===Martina===\nMartina is Susan's cousin who smashed her collarbone at a buffet in Las Vegas, and ended up suing the hotel.\n\n===Gerald===\nGerald is Susan's cousin who lives in California. He lived with Greg's family a few months after Greg was born.\n\n==toilet==\n\n===Robert Jefferson===\n<!--His first name is revealed to be Robert in Dog Days, but since Mrs. Jefferson's first name has not been revealed yet, we should currently keep this as \"Mr. Jefferson\" to keep the balance.-->\nMr. Jefferson is Rowley's father, and is far more shrill than Mr. Heffley. He is extremely rude and paranoid, and does not accept any criticism from anyone of himself or his property. He is the strictest father in the series so far. He will not let Rowley play any video game with the slightest bit of violence or fighting in it, as he thinks doing this could change Rowley into a different person. Mr. Jefferson dislikes Greg, whom he thinks is a \"bad influence\" on his son. It is also shown that Mr. Jefferson had a close bond with Rowley.\n\nHe shows little interest in sports until ''Dog Days'', where he is found playing [[tennis]] with Rowley and [[golf]] with a caddy.\n\nIn ''Dog Days'', it is revealed that Mr. Jefferson's first name is Robert. When Susan emailed him because of the note Greg sent her, it had Mr. Jefferson's first name on it.\n\nIn \"Old School\", he is stuck chaperoning the group of extra kids (which includes Rowley and Greg), much to Greg's dismay. Later, Rowley adds poison ivy to a fire started by him and he has problems breathing on the next morning, which means he and Rowley (Who had spots on his body) would be going back home.\n\nIn the film series, Mr. Jefferson has not spoken until the third film, implying that he is a man of a few words.\n\n===Linda Jefferson===\nMrs. Jefferson is Rowley's mother. She often seems to be concerned about Rowley such as the time he broke his big toe after Greg put one of his dad's dumbbells under a pillow that Rowley kept kicking at Greg's sleepover.<ref name=\"first book\"/> She also had Greg apologize to her for what he did to Rowley. Despite this, Mrs. Jefferson always enjoys Greg's company with Rowley. Although Mrs. Jefferson loves Greg, she does not let him come over because her husband dislikes him. In day 24 of the online version, it is revealed that her first name is Linda from Greg's ''The Boy Whose Family Thinks He's a DOG'' comic.\n\nIn the first film, Rowley's mother is portrayed by [[Kaye Capron]]. In ''Dog Days'', she is portrayed by Bronwen Smith.\n\n===Rowley's Grandpa===\nRowley's 90-year-old maternal grandfather only appears in ''Rodrick Rules''. It is his birthday and he asks for a chocolate cake for his next birthday.\n\n===Bampy Jefferson===\nBampy is Rowley's Paternal Grandfather who first appears in Diary Of an Awesome Friendly Kid and is revealed to be deceased. He owned a log cabin which is now owned by his son.\n===Rowley's uncle===\nRowley's Uncle who lives in China.\n===Rowley's cousins===\nRowley's Cousin's who Rowley brings to his birthday parties.\n\n==Other characters==\n\n===Fregley===\nFregley is Greg's firm and impeccably graspable acquaintance and neighbor noted for his unexplained lot of odd or disgusting eccentricities. He has been known to perplex others with his behavior, and does not have any known friends. Greg has been forced to hang around with Fregley on several occasions, to his chagrin or aggravation. It has been mentioned that Fregley is prohibited from eating [[sugar]] by his parents, and the consumption of it in large quantities will send him into hysterical, uncontrollable frenzies. In the film adaptations of the books, Fregley is played by [[Grayson Russell]].\n\n===Preston Mudd===\nPreston Mudd is one of Greg's classmates. He is said to have been the best player in the basketball unit of gym class during sixth grade at Westmore Middle School. Unfortunately, when his name was displayed as \"P. Mudd\", this led to his classmates making fun of him, calling him \"Pee Mud\".\n\n===Christopher Brownfield===\nChristopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to have been a great mosquito magnet while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \"not a school-year friend\". Later in \"The Ugly Truth\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers threaten to call all of their parents.\n\n===Tyson Sanders===\nTyson Sanders is a friend of Greg who appears in \"The Ugly Truth\". He is mentioned at the beginning along with Christopher when Greg is considering new best friends, and mentions that although Tyson is nice and into the same video games as Greg, he is turned off by the fact Tyson pulls his pants all the way down when using the urinal. When they play a game of \"[[Guess Who?]]\", the team take a picture of Tyson's bent arm, which gets them disqualified as the chaperones think the picture is of his buttocks. However, the misunderstanding is later cleared up after a mole near Tyson's elbow is matched to one shown in the picture.\n\n===Holly Hills===\nHolly Hills is one of Greg's classmates; an older girl who primarily serves as Greg's unrequited romantic interest and also Heather Hills' younger sister. She is the youngest daughter of Mr. Hills and Mrs. Hills. A minor character, she earns a prominent role in ''The Last Straw'' as the object of Greg's most recent infatuation. He is continuously motivated to impress her to no avail. Virtually oblivious to Greg's existence or identity (Greg stops trying to impress her after she mistakes him for Fregley), she appears to take an interest in Rowley's sweetness, judging by an enthusiastic message which she had signed in his yearbook (as opposed to the note that she had written for the envious Greg). She seldom appears afterwards. Greg's interest in her is seemingly damaged by events such as this and he starts showing an interest in other girls, including Holly's older sister Heather.\n\nWhereas her personality is hardly explored in the books, Holly's role was increased in film adaptions, debuting in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' as a newcomer to Greg's school with whom he is instantly besotted. She is depicted as being friendly and good-natured. The relationship she shares with Greg and Rowley is emphasized and exaggerated in the film portrayals, to the extent it can be assumed that the feelings Greg has for her may be mutual. She reappears in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.''\n\nHolly seems to enjoy the boys' companionship, and shows gratitude for Rodrick Heffley's unintentional blunders that wind up destroying the undeserving Heather's birthday party. The party ends with Holly slipping her hand into Greg's, implying that she likes him as well, and she, Greg and Rowley had a pool party not long after.\n\nHolly is portrayed by [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton R. List]].\n\n===Chirag Gupta===\nChirag Gupta is one of Greg's schoolmates and a minor character in the books. He is characterized by his short stature. Although he and Greg are well-acquainted and generally amiable to one another, Greg started the \"Invisible Chirag\" prank in ''Rodrick Rules''. During the summer the Gupta family were to move away but an unexplained alteration in their plans changed this. As a result, Chirag's classmates teasingly ignore his existence or presence for days on end, which aggravates and shocks him. Though Chirag has apparently forgiven Greg and his fellow schoolmates for concocting the prank, it is mentioned in one book that he takes advantage of his family's non-observance of the Christmas holiday, and no obligation to behave for [[Santa Claus]], to pick on Greg.\n\nIn the movie adaptions, Chirag's role is enhanced and he is a close friend of Greg and Rowley. He also plays a considerably more prominent role in these films, appearing in adaptions of books in which he is absent or hardly mentioned. He is depicted as being Indian-American. He is portrayed by [[Karan Brar]].\n\n===Patty Farrell===\n'''Patty Farrell''' is a minor character who shares an intense rivalry with Greg, which is showcased on a few occasions. It is implied she is a hardworking but sanctimonious and domineering student. She earns Greg's animosity after she suggests a map of the United States displayed in the classroom be covered during a geography quiz. Greg had planned to cheat using the map and this causes great difficulties for him, and makes him agitated. Motivated by his lust for revenge, he volunteers to play a tree in the school's upcoming production of \"[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]\"after viewing the movie adaption for the first time. He believes the role entails having to bombard the character of Dorothy Gale (whom Patty would be portraying in the play) with [[apple]]s, only to learn that this scene was deleted for the school production. He winds up re-enacting this scene, despite the script, sending his parents into a rage. She has yet to play quite as significant a role in the book series again. She has become something of a minor recurring character whose appearances are rare.\n\nIn the film adaptions of the books, Patty's role is enhanced slightly. She is depicted as being monstrously demanding. Her parents are involved with the school board in this portrayal. The motivation given for her hatred of Greg is his recital of an offensive playground chant poking fun at her that sent her bursting into tears in elementary school. She appears in the film adaptations of all three films ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days''. Alterations made to the books include her talent for both wrestling and playing [[tennis]]. She snatches any opportunity to assault Greg somehow while engaged in either sport with him. She is played by [[Laine MacNeil]].\n\n===Heather  Hills===\nHeather Hills is the attractive elder sister of Holly Hills, with whom Rodrick is infatuated. A minor character in the books, but the main antagonist in the third film, Heather is only featured in several books as the object of Greg's unrequited infatuation. However, she seems oblivious to this. A student attending Westmore High School with Rodrick, she has had several minor occupations throughout the course of the books, during each of which Rodrick fecklessly attempts to grab her attention or to impress her.\n\nLittle insight into her personality is provided in the book series. Similar to her younger sister, Holly, Heather's personality and role is further enhanced in the only film adaption in which she has appeared, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.'' In a modification of the events of the books, she is depicted as the oldest daughter of the Hills family. She is spoiled, obnoxious, rude, ignorant, selfish, conceited, ungrateful, unforgiving, cold-hearted, demanding, mistreating her family and acquaintances. Lovelorn, Rodrick Heffley and his band are hired to perform at Heather's ostentatious upcoming [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sixteenth birthday party]], and, in an attempt to earn her admiration, Rodrick winds up messing up the celebration and decorations during a boisterous, and substandard performance of [[Justin Bieber]]'s \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", which makes Heather very upset and the party ends in disaster. She is portrayed by [[Melissa Roxburgh]].\n\n===Albert Sandy===\nAlbert Sandy is a minor character, who talks often about rumors he has heard. The validity of his statements are unconfirmed. One of the statements which was not confirmed by Greg was when Albert told him that \"it was medically impossible for a girl to fart\". Some make no sense, for example, he said a man got decapitated when he sneezed.\n\nAlbert has appeared in ''The Last Straw,'' ''The Ugly Truth,'' ''Old School,'' ''Double Down,'' ''The Meltdown,'' and ''Wrecking Ball.''\n\n===Mr. Ira===\nOnly appearing in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', Mr. Ira is a teacher at Greg's school who is on the school newspaper staff, and enlists a replacement comic strip for the newspaper. He was made fun of in a comic strip entitled Dumb Teachers, and later bowdlerised Greg's Creighton the Cretin comic. He does not do the same with Rowley's Zoo-Wee Mama strip, much to Greg's chagrin.\n\n===The Snellas===\nFirst appearing in ''The Last Straw'', The Snellas are a family that lives in the Heffleys' neighborhood. They have a lot of children, all of whom are male, with names beginning with the letter S. Five of the children's names are revealed, and they are (from oldest to youngest): Shawn, Shane, Sam, Scott, and Seth. In ''The Last Straw'', it is revealed that each Snella child has a half birthday party at which the adults perform funny stunts, to attempt to make the babies laugh. According to Greg, however, no baby has laughed once.\n\nMr. Snella then sends the videos to ''America's Funniest Families'', a spoof and parody of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', and has never won anything (though after Greg is filmed wearing ''Wonder Woman'' underwear hanging off a tree with his trousers below his ankles at the end of ''The Last Straw'', the footage is sent, and it is never explained if Mr. Snella won with it).\n\nTheir most recent appearance was in ''The Ugly Truth'', when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was [[deviled eggs]], which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house.\n\n===Scotty Douglas===\nScotty is a first grader from Rowley's karate class. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Scotty was going to do a magic act in the Talent Show with Rowley as his assistant. But after Greg breaks Rowley's big toe, he has to fill in for Rowley. Greg complains about being a magician's assistant to Scotty, but Susan tells Scotty's mother that Greg would be happy to replace Rowley.\n\nScotty has a remarkably similar appearance to Greg's comic character, Creighton The Cretin, except Creighton's eyes are wide open and Scotty's eyes are beady just like all the other characters that do not wear glasses. In ''The Ugly Truth'', he becomes the new Peachy Breeze kid, yet cannot say the slogan right.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> Between ''Rodrick Rules'' and ''The Ugly Truth'' it appears that Scotty has two siblings - an unnamed baby sister and an older brother. In ''The Third Wheel,'' when Greg and Rowley become private investigators Greg looks through the window at his house to find him playing one of Greg's video games with Rowley.\n\nHe appeared in the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, with only a few lines. He is portrayed by Jakob Davies.\n\n===Mr. Underwood ===\nMr. Underwood is Greg's Phys Ed coach. In the film series, he is named Coach Malone. He is portrayed by [[Andrew McNee]].\n\n===Bill Walter===\nBill Walter is a 35-year-old high school drop out, guitarist and professional singer, who has a rude attitude towards everyone he meets. Rodrick idolizes him and his lifestyle. In the novel ''Rodrick Rules'', he was voted \"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star\" which influenced Rodrick to persuade him to join the band. Frank Heffley strongly dislikes Bill because he disapproves of his lifestyle, and is afraid Rodrick will follow in his footsteps. In the movie version of ''Rodrick Rules'' he is portrayed by [[Fran Kranz]] and is an antagonist. He agrees to join Rodrick's rock band ''Loded Diper'' and later attempts to kick him out for an unknown reason. After performing the song ''Exploded Diper'', Rodrick retaliates and kicks him out. In the book Greg describes him as unemployed and still living with his parents. Also, in ''Rodrick Rules'' Bill appears to be a slob, as he \"slorks\" pot roast.\n\n===Dr. Salazar Kagan===\nDr. Kagan, Frank's dentist, makes his debut in ''The Ugly Truth''. Frank takes Greg to Dr. Kagan instead of his usual dentist, a pretty woman named Rachel on whom Greg has a crush. Greg bites Dr. Kagan's finger when his teeth are being checked. In what Greg believes to be an act of revenge, Dr. Kagan tells Frank that Greg needs headgear to correct his overbite. Greg says Dr. Kagan is scary and evil and that he never fools around. He has sharp metal tools and never smiles. The billboards for Dr. Kagan's dental practice make Greg freak out every time he sees one of them on the highway.\n\nDr. Kagan later makes a cameo in Double Down, in a scene where Greg describes how a Spineticklers book has made going to the dentist an even more frightening experience for him.\n\n===Lenwood Heath===\nLenwood Heath only appears in ''The Last Straw''. He is a rebellious teenager, who was Greg's father's arch-enemy for about three months before he was sent to military academy. This resulted in him becoming a fine young man who works at the movie theater. In the ''Dog Days'' film, he is portrayed by Tom Stevens, and is seen working as a lifeguard at the community pool the Heffleys go to.\n\n===Taylor Pringle===\nTaylor Pringle is a minor character who only appears in the films, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days'' and does not appear in the books. She is a very rude little girl, and is first seen at the end of the opening scene in ''Rodrick Rules'' in which during her [[birthday party]] at the [[roller rink]], Rodrick embarrasses Greg, prompting Greg to try and tackle him, but he misses and lands in Taylor's [[birthday cake]], destroying it. As a result of this, Taylor gets angry and she and her friends begin beating up Greg as the intro begins. Later in the film, during church, when Rodrick intentionally pulls down the sweater around Greg's waist to reveal the chocolate stain on Greg's pants, Taylor points it out to everyone, mistaking it for poop. Then, in ''Dog Days'', when Greg attempts to impress Holly by jumping off the [[high diving|high]] [[diving platform|diving board]], he becomes nervous, due to it being very high above the water. Taylor then comes up behind Greg and states that he is talking to himself, due to being scared. When Greg gives Taylor a brush-off that he is not scared and that she would not understand since she is \"just a little kid\", she pressures him to jump. When Greg jumps, he loses his [[swimsuit]] on the board, and Taylor chucks it onto a nearby fence to get back at Greg for brushing her off. As a result, Greg is forced to borrow a girl's swimsuit that reads ''Holly'' on it until he goes to the fence to retrieve his own swimsuit, and as he does so, he gets taunted by Patty. Taylor is portrayed by [[Dalila Bela]].\n\n===Jordan Jury===\nOnly appearing in ''The Ugly Truth'', Jordan Jury is the popular boy in the grade above Greg, who's known for always throwing huge parties that have little to no adult supervision. Greg is amazed when he discovers that he has been given a textbook that used to belong to him. Jordan invites Greg and Rowley to his latest party, but Greg cannot not go because of his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. But at the end of the book, Greg discovers that it's actually a good thing he didn't go to the party as it would seem. The only reason Jordan invited the kids in Greg and Rowley's grade to his party was to basically use them as servants.\n\n===Angie Steadman===\nAngie Steadman only appears as an additional character in the ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' film. She is in seventh grade, has a pink streak of hair, works for the school newspaper, and hates middle school. In the film, Greg and Rowley meet her under the bleachers during a game of \"Gladiator\". She gets along with Rowley, but starts a rocky relationship with Greg after he egotistically declines her offer to join the school newspaper. Greg later tells the whole school he ate the cheese instead of Rowley and she compliments and accepts him when she sees that Greg is learning the errors of his ways. In the film, she is portrayed by [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]].\n\n===Pete Hosey===\nPete Hosey is the leader of the teenagers who attacked Greg and Rowley on [[Halloween]]. He is an antagonist in the first film. He is unnamed in the first book and he is replaced by Herbie Reamer in the online version. After hassling Greg and Rowley on Halloween, Greg yells that he will call the cops, and they chase him to Greg's grandmother's house. In the book, Greg and Rowley sneak back home, but in the movie, they try to intimidate Pete and his friends with a weed hacker, before Pete scratches his car and they are chased into the woods. In both the book and the movie, the teens hold a vendetta against Greg and Rowley. Near the end they corner them on the school field and decide to force them to eat the moldy cheese. Rowley is forced to eat the cheese, but Greg avoids it by saying he's lactose intolerant. In the movie they are chased off by the coach.\n\n===The Warrens===\nAlthough his family is vaguely referenced in the books, the Warren's are what got Frank thinking of making Greg more manly. In the books, Mr. Warren is Frank's boss. Frank is deeply jealous of the Warrens. In stark contrast to Greg, the Warrens' children are shown to be athletic and sporty. In the third film, Stan, the father of the family, is shown to be a neighbor of the Heffleys. He had a minor childhood rivalry with Frank, that they appear to have gotten over as adults. In the movie, Mr. Warren is the troop master of the Wilderness Explorers, and invites everyone over for an Independence Day party. They only appear in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]''.\n\n===The Beardos===\nOnly appearing in ''The Long Haul'', the Beardos are the main antagonists of the book. They are a couple with three sons. The Heffleys indirectly met them during their road trip, though only Greg knows who they are. Their first encounter is at a motel, where Greg angrily berates one of the Beardo children, who then tells his father on him, causing Greg to fear running into them again. Greg and his family are convinced that the Beardos have stolen their luggage and belongings at a place they both attended called \"Soak Central.\" They try to track them down though it was revealed at the end that Greg actually had the key to their locker in Soak Central, and that he got the number in the lottery . Their belongings were actually there. The family's real surname is unknown, as Greg himself does not who they are. It is likely he dubbed them this because of the patriarch's noticeably long beard.\n\nIn the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'', Mr. and Mrs. Beardo are portrayed by [[Chris Coppola]] and Kimberli Lincoln, and have a daughter named Brandi and two sons named Brandon and Brent. The Beardos are depicted as much more malicious, with Mr. Beardo chasing Greg around through the carnival to get revenge.\n\n===Chris=== \nChris is a friend of Rodrick and the [[bassist]] in Loded Diper.\n\n===Joshie===\nJoshie is a singer who is famous in Europe and is Rowley's favorite singer and idol. Greg believes that Joshie is for six-year-old girls, but Rowley ignores him, saying that Greg is jealous because he was the one who \"discovered\" Joshie. However, despite Rowley's opinion, Joshie appears to be a singer that is mainly idolized by females.\n\n===Maddox Selsam===\nMaddox Selsam is a boy who lives in the middle of the woods. He is not allowed to have any screen time, and does not have a TV at his house. He enjoys playing with his Legos and practicing his violin. He met Greg in ''Double Down'' when he found Greg's balloon for the Balloon Brigade at his school.\n==Pets==\n\n===Dogs===\n====Sweetie====\nSweetie is a dog that first appeared in ''Dog Days''. Greg's dad buys him after discovering that his father lied about accidentally killing his childhood dog, Nutty. Sweetie wreaks havoc in the Heffley household and is given to Gramma at the end of the book. Sweetie undergoes drastic weight gain at Gramma's house because he is fed lots of table scraps. Eventually Gramma dresses him up like a little human. Greg and Rodrick like playing with him by going up behind him and making flatulence sounds. He will then sniff his rear end until he goes to sleep.\n\n====Nutty====\nNutty is Frank's old dog which he had when he was around Greg's age. Grandpa accidentally ran over and killed Nutty with his station wagon when he backed out of the driveway. Grandpa covered the truth by saying that Nutty ran away to a butterfly farm. Frank is very angry when he finds out the truth during a Father's Day brunch.\n\n====Killer====\nKiller is Joe Heffley's [[Rottweiler]]-type pet dog. In ''Dog Days'', he wreaks havoc by eating most of Greg's birthday cake, leaving Greg not wanting to eat it.\n\n====Rudy====\nRudy was Aunt Cakey's dog. He was usually oblivious to what was going on around him, opting to stare straight ahead doing nothing. It is not known how Rudy died.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is Gramma's dog who died around the time of the dog days of summer.\n\n====Rebel====\nRebel is a [[Rottweiler]] that used to chase Greg and Rowley on their way to school before his owner installed an electric fence around the front yard. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Fish===\n====Greg's Fish====\nIn ''Dog Days'', Greg buys an angel fish from a pet store. He also buys a journal to log the actions of his fish but later realizes he can not put much in it. Greg's fish was later made to share a tank with Rodrick's fish, who ate it while Greg and his family were at the water park on [[Father's Day]].\n\n====Rodrick's Fish====\nRodrick's fish is a [[piranha]]-type fish that was picked out the fish at a pet store in ''Dog Days,'' because it was described as aggressive. Due to Rodrick's neglect at cleaning the tank it was made to share a tank with Greg's fish, which it ate. The fish has not appeared since ''Dog Days,'' with no further mention of its eventual fate.\n\n===Other Pets===\n====Aunt Gretchen's pets====\nAunt Gretchen has about thirty pets that the Heffleys pet-sit in ''Hard Luck'', while she is on vacation. Her pets include three dogs, two cats, a mouse, a parakeet, a turtle, a snake, a lizard, and a litter of bunnies that her rabbit gave birth to while Gretchen was away (despite the fact that the rabbit was actually male).\n\n====Squirm====\nSquirm was an inchworm Greg found and took care of when he was nine. It was stood on and squashed by Manny when he began learning how to walk.\n\n====The Pig====\nThe Heffleys\u2019 pet pig has appeared in all books except ''The Getaway'' since ''The Long Haul'', in which Manny Heffley won it at a country fair for correctly guessing the weight of a hog. To the annoyance of Greg, the pig exhibits extraordinary intelligence and gains human characteristics. One running gag is that despite not having opposable thumbs, the pig opens objects such as soda cans. In ''The Meltdown'' the Pig throws a tantrum for being excluded from the trip to Isla de Corales in ''The Getaway''. Frank sends it to obedience school, only for the Pig to escape on its second day there. The Pig is never found by the Heffleys despite numerous missing posters, and the pig's fate is left unclear.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]\n[[Category:Diary of a Wimpy Kid (series)]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{in-universe |date= April 2012}}\n{{primary sources|date=July 2015}}\n}}\n{{Use American English|date=August 2015}}\n\nThis is a list of characters in [[Jeff Kinney (author)|Jeff Kinney]]'s ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'' graphic novel series, as well as in the film adaptations of the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|first]],<ref name=\"MDN\">{{cite news|url=http://www.milforddailynews.com/news/x2118273676/Nothing-Wimpy-about-local-authors-success |title=Nothing 'Wimpy' about local author's success |last=McCarron |first=Heather |date=October 12, 2009 |publisher=[[Milford Daily News]] |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}</ref> [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (film)|second]],<ref name=\"Moviefone\">[http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/12/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-rodrick-rules-release-date-march-25-2011 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' Sequel to Bow Next March] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325214154/http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/12/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-rodrick-rules-release-date-march-25-2011 |date=2012-03-25 }}.

They cause too much confusion.-->\n==Greg Heffley==\n{{Main article|Greg Heffley}}\n\n'''Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley''' is 12 years old in the first novel. Greg's actions can be antagonistic at times, including terrorizing kids, trying to steal money from a church collection basket,  lying in confession, picking on other students, playing pranks on his best friend, selling falsely advertised \"fitness water,\" and praying for bad stuff to happen to others.He also is a very bad friend. However, he also demonstrates a degree of kindness in some of his actions. He helps his brother with his homework, gets his friend a date for a dance, and forgives his friends. Greg is portrayed by [[Zachary Gordon]] in the first three films, and [[Jason Drucker]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Rowley Jefferson==\n'''Rowley Jefferson''' is Greg's best friend. In the first book, Rowley is an antagonist in Greg's point of view while technically in a [[third-person view]], Greg is the antagonist and Rowley is the protagonist. At the end of ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel]]'', Rowley begins dating Abigail Brown, a girl who was originally Greg's date for the [[Valentine's Day]] dance. This plot continues in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck]]'', where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail. At the end of the book, the couple break up and he becomes friends with Greg again.\n\nRowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender, such as liking a singer for \"six-year-old girls\" named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids. Rowley is also the owner of the [[comic strip]] ''Zoo Wee Mama.''<ref name=\"first book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first= Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|series= ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''\n|publisher= [[Amulet Books]]\n|year= 2007\n|isbn= 0-8109-9313-9}}</ref>\nRowley claims that Greg had nothing to do with the comic strip in the first book, a rare antagonistic move from him. In the movie series, Rowley is portrayed by [[Robert Capron]] (the first 3 movies) and Owen Asztalos (The Long Haul).\n\n==Frank Heffley==\n'''Frank Heffley''' is Greg's overreactive but well-meaning father. He is interested in U.S. history, and his replica of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefield is a plot point in the series.<ref name=\"second book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2008\n|isbn=\n}}</ref> Frank is edgy around Rowley,<ref name=\"second book\" /> does not appreciate Greg's skill at [[video games]], loathes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name=\"first book\"/> and [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"third book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2009\n|isbn= 0-8109-7068-6\n}}</ref> He tries to toughen Greg up and threatens to send him to a [[military academy]] in ''The Last Straw'', although ultimately this does not come to fruition, much to Greg's relief.<ref name=\"third book\" /> However, Greg and Frank grow together in ''Dog Days'', despite a brief period when Frank does not speak to Greg after almost getting arrested.\n\nFrank is addicted to junk food; in ''The Last Straw'', he makes a New Year's Resolution to go on a strict diet, but Greg later catches him in the garage eating brownies.\n\nFrank is portrayed by [[Steve Zahn]] in the first three films of the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series]]''. In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', he is played by [[Tom Everett Scott]].\n\n==Susan Heffley==\nSusan Heffley (known as Ann Heffley in the online version) is the mother of Manny, Gregory, and Rodrick. She is known for being overprotective and spoiling Manny. Gregory is embarrassed often because of her\nIn the first three films, Susan is portrayed by [[Rachael Harris]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Manny Heffley==\nManny Heffley is Greg's and Rodrick's younger brother, and the youngest of the Heffley family.\nHe is a spoiled kindergardener who is constantly doted on by his mother being than he is early childhood. He makes a great number of demands and throws huge temper tandrums if they are not fulfilled. Among Manny's most well known characteristics are his refusal to be toilet trained and his complete inability to remain in [[Preschool|nursery school]]. He frequently damages Greg's property and uses his age as an excuse for doing so. Whenever they go on vacations, Manny ends up ruining and gets away with it. The excesive coddling he receives from his parents infuriates Greg. He also takes advantage of his overindulgence. It is often implied that his father, Frank is frustrated with babying Manny, especially when it comes to potty training and making his son give up his pacifier. It is revealed in the Third Wheel that Manny has imaginary friends, whom he blames for hus misbehavior. Despite being just a kindergardener and just spoiled attitude,Manny shows signs of actually possessing more intelligence than he appears to have. He surprises his family by his ability to speak Spanish in \"The Long Haul\", but plays this to his advantage by persuading a group of Spanish-Speakers to retrieve their pet pig. He is his grandmother's favorite grandchild, although she denies this. In the three movies based on the first four books, Manny is portrayed by Connor and Owen Fielding. In the movie, \"[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]], Manny also gets a pet pig in \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid:The Long Haul\". He is portrayed by Wyatt and Dylan Walters.  \n\n==Rodrick Heffley==\n'''Rodrick Heffley''' is Greg's lazy and aggressive older brother. He is the drummer in a garage band called \"L\u00f6ded Diper\" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] concerts and limited musical abilities. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers. \n\nRodrick is infamous for his stereotypical rebellious nature, feigning illness in ''Rodrick Rules'' so as to be allowed to remain at home to throw a chaotic house party during his parents' absence, only for the evidence to appear in newly developed photographs that are quickly discovered by the boys' parents. He bullies Greg a lot and pulls awful pranks that ruins Greg's and his family's life. Rodrick also possesses incompetent tendencies, as his school assignments are notoriously crude and inadequate. Rodrick also makes numerous idiotic mistakes, such as believing a mini-safe is a microwave and cinnamon bun dough which had exploded all over the car was his brains. His spelling abilities are also poor, and he devotes a lot of time to tormenting Greg. In the books, Rodrick owns and drives a white [[van]], which sports his band's name written in large black letters, on either side of it and lacks any back seats, the reason being that Rodrick needs room for his band equipment. In the movie series, the van is revealed to be a 1996 [[Chevrolet Astro]] [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] van, which also sports a diaper's pin drawn on the rear doors. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Greg is haunted by the fact that Rodrick knows about his most mortifying experience during the summertime. This haunts him when he returns to school. However, his fears are quickly eased after the story becomes distorted to Greg's advantage due to it being passed around by so many people, temporarily boosting his popularity. By the end of the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, he is much closer to Greg, and his actions to him becomes much less aggressive. This is also shown in the film adaptation of Dog Days when Rodrick thanks Greg for getting him a gig at Heather Hills' Sweet 16. In the first three films in the film series based on the books, Rodrick is played by [[Devon Bostick]]. In the fourth film, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', Rodrick is played by Charlie Wright.\n\n==Greg's extended family ==\n\n===Gramma===\nGramma is Susan's mother and Greg's maternal grandmother. Gramma is known to drive a car like the Heffleys'. Greg often calls her to his home as a way to avoid his dad's scoldings, since his dad will not do this when she is around. Her favorite grandchild is Manny, although she denies and lies about this.\n\n===  Grandpa Heffley===\nGrandpa is Greg's unpredictable paternal grandfather, who is asked to babysit Rodrick and his brother in ''Rodrick Rules''. He lives in a retirement home called Leisure Towers and enjoys playing games such as \"Gutbusters\" and \"Rummy\", which the two boys find boring. He never watches any real shows on the television; instead he constantly has his television tuned to the [[CCTV]] in the retirement home lobby, which he spends his time watching. In ''Old School'', he moves out of Leisure Towers because the rent is too high and moves in with the Heffleys. Grandpa has a girlfriend named Darlene in the ''Hard Luck'' and broke up with her in ''Old School.'' Grandpa dates online. Grandpa eventually accumulates a large number of girlfriends online, culminating in him accidentally inviting all of them over and throwing a party with them. Greg is his favorite. Grandpa is known for preparing what he calls \"Watercress Salad\", a disgusting dish consisting of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in vinegar. Greg hates Watercress Salad, and Rodrick is aware of this, so he pretends that Greg loves it and puts a large helping onto his plate. It's stated that Grandpa never spent much time with Frank when he was a boy, and they seem to have a poor relationship. Grandpa once accidentally ran over Frank's [[dog]] with his [[car]] and lied to him about it before telling him, expecting a laugh, and constantly criticizes Frank during his stay at the Heffleys' house. He has not been seen since ''Double Down,'' implying that he possibly moved out.\n\n===Joe Heffley===\nJoe Heffley is Frank's brother and Greg's uncle. Frank has a sibling rivalry with Joe due to his actions. When Manny started potty training, Uncle Joe told him to watch out for the \"potty monster\", causing him to fear using the bathroom, forcing Frank to change his diapers for a longer time. Uncle Joe's children call their uncle \"Aunt Fwank\", which Frank swears he told them to do on purpose. Susan thinks it's cute, though. In ''Dog Days'', Greg mentions that he tried to make Uncle Joe convince Frank to get a dog, but that did not work out. He also mentions that Joe's dog, Killer ate most of his birthday cake.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Wife===\nJoe Heffley's wife is a dark-haired woman and Greg's aunt. She appears rarely in the books.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Children===\nJoe Heffley has at least 3 children, who all appear to be a bit older than Manny, and are Greg's cousins. They all call Frank \"Aunt Fwank.\"\n\n===Great-Uncle Charlie===\nCharlie is Nana's brother and Greg's great uncle. He is also Greg's \"secret weapon\" at Christmas, as he asks him to buy him presents that his parents have forbidden him from receiving. However, this backfires as he is usually given the wrong thing. Charlie is a [[bachelor]] and spends his spare money well. Greg says he wants to follow in his footsteps. In ''The Last Straw'', Charlie got Greg a laundry hoop, hinting that he is tired of being Greg's secret weapon at Christmas, as the events that transpired meant that Greg effectively got a chore for Christmas.\n\n===Uncle Cecil===\nCecil is the boys' Step-Cousin Once Removed but is only 3 or 4 years old. He sits at the grown-ups table at family gatherings because Greg's Great Aunt Marcie adopted him and since he's her son, he's allowed to sit at the grown-ups' table. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Loretta (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nLoretta is Greg's great-aunt and the sister of Grandpa, Arthur and Reba. She got a thank you note for some pants she gave Greg at Christmas. She appeared mainly in ''Rodrick Rules'' at the [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. She also appeared a couple of times in the ''Do It Yourself Book'' and ''The Ugly Truth.'' It is implied that Greg and Rodrick dislike her, as they fight over who has to greet her first when she visits.\n\n===Aunt Veronica===\nAunt Veronica is Greg's aunt and Susan's sister. Greg states that she has never been seen in person since he was 3 or 4 years old, probably because being with the family in person really stresses her out, but calls her family members on video chat. When Greg was sitting on the toilet playing games on his new phone (which was actually a hand-me-down from his mother), she accidentally started a video chat with him. This startled him, leading to him dropping the phone into the toilet.. She appears in ''Hard Luck'' multiple times \u2013 often in person \u2013 but on other occasions by video conference on a tablet and the used phone that Susan gave to Greg.\n\n===Terrence===\nTerrence is Frank's second cousin. It is implied that Greg thinks he is stupid. This was suggested when he was explaining that when Terrence was his age, he looked exactly like him, which is true.<ref name=\"fifth book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Gammie Heffley===\nGammie is Greg's great-grandmother, and the unofficial head of the Heffley family. She only appears in ''The Ugly Truth'', as a minor character. She also has [[Lego]] building bricks that Susan bought so that her kids had something to do at her house. Gammie is a trickster and knows a lot because of \"experience\". When someone in the family is about 12 or 13 years old she gives them ''The Talk'', which is about how kids should not be hurrying to grow up.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\nGammie loves having visitors for dinner. One day she bought a scratch ticket, and matched up two pictures and told all her family members that she had won a lot of money. Everyone was in a big rush to visit her. When they all arrived Frank told Gammie that to win, she had to match up three pictures. When she found this out, she did not really care. She pulled a roast right out of the oven, and Greg figures she got what she really wanted anyway. Gammie is the mother of Grandpa, Arthur, Reba, and Loretta Heffley.\n\nGammie is briefly mentioned by Greg in ''Cabin Fever'' when he says she gave a miniature carousel that held spoons from all over the world to Greg's family five or six years before.\n\n===Reba (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nReba was Greg's great-aunt. Gammie forgot to give her an invitation at Christmas, but she came anyway. She only appeared in ''The Ugly Truth''. She is stubborn. She and Loretta are identical twins. Reba was the sister of Grandpa, Loretta, and Arthur Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> In ''Wrecking Ball,'' it was revealed that she died in her sleep, and Greg's family attended someone else's funeral instead of hers by mistake. Greg forgot about Reba at first, until Susan reminded him that she used to send him angry letters for forgetting to send her thank-you notes for his birthday money.\n\n===Gary Heffley===\nGarrison \"Gary\" Heffley is Greg's uncle and has been married four times. In ''The Ugly Truth'' it is revealed that all of his wives divorced him as soon as they found out about his financial situation and job. In ''The Third Wheel'' he comes to live with Greg's family after he discovers his job selling shirts in Boston was a ripoff. Later in the book he is chosen to be the DJ at Greg's [[Valentine's Day]] dance.\n\n====First wife: Linda====\nReason for divorce: Job unappealing for her (Gary was working as a mascot at children's parties).\n\n====Second wife: Charlene====\nReason for divorce: Financial miscommunication (He had $45 in his bank account instead of $45,000, and she didn't find out until their wedding, when it was time to pay the band.)\n\n====Third wife: Lydia====\nReason for divorce: Unknown, possibly because of a tattoo that used to read \"Lydia\" (and was later modified to read \"I am not in love with Lydia anymore\").\n\n====Fourth wife: Sonja====\nLikely reason for divorce: He was only engaged to her by accident when a plane with a banner saying \"MARRY ME SONJA\" flew over the baseball game where he was going to break up with her because he wanted to start dating her sister. Apparently, there was another Sonja at the baseball stadium. Before Gary could say anything, Sonja turned around and said \"YES, YES!\" When they divorced, it was after their wedding when Gary's friend included the story in his speech.<ref name=\"fifth book\" />\n\n===Aunt Dorothy===\nDorothy is Greg's great aunt who always kisses him on the lips. Greg's mom, Susan, says it is rude to wipe off the kisses Dorothy gives him. She is overweight and sometimes passes gas loudly.\n\nShe appears on the \"Have You Ever\" page in the ''Do-It-Yourself Book'' when Greg asks: \"Have you ever been kissed full on the lips by a relative who's older than seventy?\" This probably means she is older than 70 years old, and that she is actually his great-aunt.\n\n===Arthur Heffley===\nArthur Heffley is Greg's great-uncle. He only speaks in grunts or makes random sounds. He never has an actual conversation with anybody, but sometimes Greg tries to respond to him just in case he is trying to communicate. Arthur is the brother of Reba, Grandpa, and Loretta Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\n\n===Great Uncle Bruce===\nGreat Uncle Bruce is Greg's deceased great-uncle. He is a character who is mentioned in ''Cabin Fever'' and ''The Third Wheel.'' Greg is presented with a rather luxurious [[blanket]] as a Christmas gift, only to be repelled by it upon learning that it had formerly belonged to Great Uncle Bruce before his death. In ''The Third Wheel'', Greg uses Great Uncle Bruce's old cologne on Valentine's Day, which ends up attracting some old ladies.\n\n===Byron Heffley===\nByron is Frank's cousin whom Greg is not excited to see<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> because at Gammie's last family meeting, he was sent out to get milk, but hit a pothole halfway home, and got a flat tire. Greg had to get him. He needed supplies, so Greg returned to Gammie's. Because of his muddy shoes, the ladies needed to warn him because he was about to track mud into the house. Unfortunately, he forgot about Byron's tire, and he was not happy when he got to Gammie's.\n\nHe only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Nana Heffley===\nNot much is known about Nana. She is Greg, Rodrick, and Manny's paternal grandmother, mother to Frank, Joe and Gary, and Mother-in-law to Susan. She is Grandpa's wife. It is revealed in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down|Double Down]]'' that she died when Greg was younger and it makes him uncomfortable to think she is \"watching\" him from heaven.\n\nHer first appearance was in ''Double Down'' (and possibly her only appearance).<ref>{{cite book\n\n|last= Kenney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2011\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Aunt Cakey===\nAunt Cakey is Susan's oldest sister and does not like kids. She used to have a dog. Susan never trusts her to babysit Greg.\n\nShe only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Aunt Audra===\nAunt Audra is one of Susan's sisters. She believes in crystal balls and took Greg along with her to see her fortuneteller a few times. Susan thinks Audra is wasting her money. The fortuneteller also told Audra that Meemaw's ring was inside a photo album. It turned out the fortuneteller did not mean it literally.\n\n===Aunt Gretchen===\nAunt Gretchen is Susan's youngest sister. She has two out-of-control twin sons, Malvin and Malcolm. Aunt Gretchen has at least thirty pets. In ''Hard Luck'', her rabbit (which everyone thought was a male but was actually female) has a litter of bunnies, angering Frank. \n\n===Malvin and Malcolm===\nMalvin and Malcolm are Gretchen's two sons. They are out-of-control kids. Once, they played throw and catch with a strong sharp piece of concrete. Malvin had to go to the emergency room to get stitches in his forehead. Malcolm is the wilder. He once got hold of Frank's shaving kit and shaved himself. He also called the police to report Greg's family for running out of ketchup. This results in Frank angrily making them leave.\n\n===Meemaw and Peepaw===\nMeemaw and Peepaw are the parents of Gramma and her two sisters and are the  maternal grandparents of Susan. Their first appearance was in ''Hard Luck''. Peepaw is portrayed as old and batty. Meemaw is dead, while Peepaw is still alive. Meemaw was in charge of putting prizes in the Easter eggs and wore a diamond ring, which was extremely valuable because it had been in her family for three generations. Before she died, she accidentally put her ring in an Easter egg that was found by Greg at the end of the book.\n\nMeemaw appears in [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'']] played by Mimi Gould. Meemaw's birthday results in Susan's \"great Heffley road trip\".\n\n===Gramma's sisters===\nGramma's sisters are the great-aunts of Rodrick, Greg, and Manny. They are the aunt's of Susan Heffley and her sisters.\n\n===Lawrence===\nLawrence is Greg's first cousin once removed who is always traveling, and therefore is unable to make it to family events. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Chester \"Remus\" Heffley===\nChester Heffley was Greg's great-grandfather and Gammie Heffley's husband. It was revealed that he died in ''The Ugly Truth''. Greg referred to him as Remus in ''The Do it Yourself Book''.\n\n===Georgia===\nGeorgia is Greg's second cousin who has an extremely loose tooth that she does not want to pull out. She only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Benjy===\nBenjy is Greg's third cousin. He can read chapter books and speak in full sentences. However, he still isn't potty trained. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Tony and Patricia===\nTony is Greg's second cousin once removed and Patricia is his wife. They are the parents of Benjy.\n\n===Uncle Larry===\nUncle Larry is supposedly Greg's uncle. Greg is not sure if he is an actual relative, and he thinks someone invited him to a family gathering at some point and that he has been coming ever since. When Audra's fortune teller told her Meemaw's ring was in a photo album, Larry helped realize that the ring was in a plastic egg. This was proved to be true, as it was found in a plastic egg by Greg later on.\n\n===Martina===\nMartina is Susan's cousin who smashed her collarbone at a buffet in Las Vegas, and ended up suing the hotel.\n\n===Gerald===\nGerald is Susan's cousin who lives in California. He lived with Greg's family a few months after Greg was born.\n\n==Rowley's family==\n\n===Robert Jefferson===\n<!--His first name is revealed to be Robert in Dog Days, but since Mrs. Jefferson's first name has not been revealed yet, we should currently keep this as \"Mr. Jefferson\" to keep the balance.-->\nMr. Jefferson is Rowley's father, and is far more shrill than Mr. Heffley. He is extremely rude and paranoid, and does not accept any criticism from anyone of himself or his property. He is the strictest father in the series so far. He will not let Rowley play any video game with the slightest bit of violence or fighting in it, as he thinks doing this could change Rowley into a different person. Mr. Jefferson dislikes Greg, whom he thinks is a \"bad influence\" on his son. It is also shown that Mr. Jefferson had a close bond with Rowley.\n\nHe shows little interest in sports until ''Dog Days'', where he is found playing [[tennis]] with Rowley and [[golf]] with a caddy.\n\nIn ''Dog Days'', it is revealed that Mr. Jefferson's first name is Robert. When Susan emailed him because of the note Greg sent her, it had Mr. Jefferson's first name on it.\n\nIn \"Old School\", he is stuck chaperoning the group of extra kids (which includes Rowley and Greg), much to Greg's dismay. Later, Rowley adds poison ivy to a fire started by him and he has problems breathing on the next morning, which means he and Rowley (Who had spots on his body) would be going back home.\n\nIn the film series, Mr. Jefferson has not spoken until the third film, implying that he is a man of a few words.\n\n===Linda Jefferson===\nMrs. Jefferson is Rowley's mother. She often seems to be concerned about Rowley such as the time he broke his big toe after Greg put one of his dad's dumbbells under a pillow that Rowley kept kicking at Greg's sleepover.<ref name=\"first book\"/> She also had Greg apologize to her for what he did to Rowley. Despite this, Mrs. Jefferson always enjoys Greg's company with Rowley. Although Mrs. Jefferson loves Greg, she does not let him come over because her husband dislikes him. In day 24 of the online version, it is revealed that her first name is Linda from Greg's ''The Boy Whose Family Thinks He's a DOG'' comic.\n\nIn the first film, Rowley's mother is portrayed by [[Kaye Capron]]. In ''Dog Days'', she is portrayed by Bronwen Smith.\n\n===Rowley's Grandpa===\nRowley's 90-year-old maternal grandfather only appears in ''Rodrick Rules''. It is his birthday and he asks for a chocolate cake for his next birthday.\n\n===Bampy Jefferson===\nBampy is Rowley's Paternal Grandfather who first appears in Diary Of an Awesome Friendly Kid and is revealed to be deceased. He owned a log cabin which is now owned by his son.\n===Rowley's uncle===\nRowley's Uncle who lives in China.\n===Rowley's cousins===\nRowley's Cousin's who Rowley brings to his birthday parties.\n\n==Other characters==\n\n===Fregley===\nFregley is Greg's firm and impeccably graspable acquaintance and neighbor noted for his unexplained lot of odd or disgusting eccentricities. He has been known to perplex others with his behavior, and does not have any known friends. Greg has been forced to hang around with Fregley on several occasions, to his chagrin or aggravation. It has been mentioned that Fregley is prohibited from eating [[sugar]] by his parents, and the consumption of it in large quantities will send him into hysterical, uncontrollable frenzies. In the film adaptations of the books, Fregley is played by [[Grayson Russell]].\n\n===Preston Mudd===\nPreston Mudd is one of Greg's classmates. He is said to have been the best player in the basketball unit of gym class during sixth grade at Westmore Middle School. Unfortunately, when his name was displayed as \"P. Mudd\", this led to his classmates making fun of him, calling him \"Pee Mud\".\n\n===Christopher Brownfield===\nChristopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to have been a great mosquito magnet while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \"not a school-year friend\". Later in \"The Ugly Truth\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers threaten to call all of their parents.\n\n===Tyson Sanders===\nTyson Sanders is a friend of Greg who appears in \"The Ugly Truth\". He is mentioned at the beginning along with Christopher when Greg is considering new best friends, and mentions that although Tyson is nice and into the same video games as Greg, he is turned off by the fact Tyson pulls his pants all the way down when using the urinal. When they play a game of \"[[Guess Who?]]\", the team take a picture of Tyson's bent arm, which gets them disqualified as the chaperones think the picture is of his buttocks. However, the misunderstanding is later cleared up after a mole near Tyson's elbow is matched to one shown in the picture.\n\n===Holly Hills===\nHolly Hills is one of Greg's classmates; an older girl who primarily serves as Greg's unrequited romantic interest and also Heather Hills' younger sister. She is the youngest daughter of Mr. Hills and Mrs. Hills. A minor character, she earns a prominent role in ''The Last Straw'' as the object of Greg's most recent infatuation. He is continuously motivated to impress her to no avail. Virtually oblivious to Greg's existence or identity (Greg stops trying to impress her after she mistakes him for Fregley), she appears to take an interest in Rowley's sweetness, judging by an enthusiastic message which she had signed in his yearbook (as opposed to the note that she had written for the envious Greg). She seldom appears afterwards. Greg's interest in her is seemingly damaged by events such as this and he starts showing an interest in other girls, including Holly's older sister Heather.\n\nWhereas her personality is hardly explored in the books, Holly's role was increased in film adaptions, debuting in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' as a newcomer to Greg's school with whom he is instantly besotted. She is depicted as being friendly and good-natured. The relationship she shares with Greg and Rowley is emphasized and exaggerated in the film portrayals, to the extent it can be assumed that the feelings Greg has for her may be mutual. She reappears in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.''\n\nHolly seems to enjoy the boys' companionship, and shows gratitude for Rodrick Heffley's unintentional blunders that wind up destroying the undeserving Heather's birthday party. The party ends with Holly slipping her hand into Greg's, implying that she likes him as well, and she, Greg and Rowley had a pool party not long after.\n\nHolly is portrayed by [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton R. List]].\n\n===Chirag Gupta===\nChirag Gupta is one of Greg's schoolmates and a minor character in the books. He is characterized by his short stature. Although he and Greg are well-acquainted and generally amiable to one another, Greg started the \"Invisible Chirag\" prank in ''Rodrick Rules''. During the summer the Gupta family were to move away but an unexplained alteration in their plans changed this. As a result, Chirag's classmates teasingly ignore his existence or presence for days on end, which aggravates and shocks him. Though Chirag has apparently forgiven Greg and his fellow schoolmates for concocting the prank, it is mentioned in one book that he takes advantage of his family's non-observance of the Christmas holiday, and no obligation to behave for [[Santa Claus]], to pick on Greg.\n\nIn the movie adaptions, Chirag's role is enhanced and he is a close friend of Greg and Rowley. He also plays a considerably more prominent role in these films, appearing in adaptions of books in which he is absent or hardly mentioned. He is depicted as being Indian-American. He is portrayed by [[Karan Brar]].\n\n===Patty Farrell===\n'''Patty Farrell''' is a minor character who shares an intense rivalry with Greg, which is showcased on a few occasions. It is implied she is a hardworking but sanctimonious and domineering student. She earns Greg's animosity after she suggests a map of the United States displayed in the classroom be covered during a geography quiz. Greg had planned to cheat using the map and this causes great difficulties for him, and makes him agitated. Motivated by his lust for revenge, he volunteers to play a tree in the school's upcoming production of \"[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]\"after viewing the movie adaption for the first time. He believes the role entails having to bombard the character of Dorothy Gale (whom Patty would be portraying in the play) with [[apple]]s, only to learn that this scene was deleted for the school production. He winds up re-enacting this scene, despite the script, sending his parents into a rage. She has yet to play quite as significant a role in the book series again. She has become something of a minor recurring character whose appearances are rare.\n\nIn the film adaptions of the books, Patty's role is enhanced slightly. She is depicted as being monstrously demanding. Her parents are involved with the school board in this portrayal. The motivation given for her hatred of Greg is his recital of an offensive playground chant poking fun at her that sent her bursting into tears in elementary school. She appears in the film adaptations of all three films ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days''. Alterations made to the books include her talent for both wrestling and playing [[tennis]]. She snatches any opportunity to assault Greg somehow while engaged in either sport with him. She is played by [[Laine MacNeil]].\n\n===Heather  Hills===\nHeather Hills is the attractive elder sister of Holly Hills, with whom Rodrick is infatuated. A minor character in the books, but the main antagonist in the third film, Heather is only featured in several books as the object of Greg's unrequited infatuation. However, she seems oblivious to this. A student attending Westmore High School with Rodrick, she has had several minor occupations throughout the course of the books, during each of which Rodrick fecklessly attempts to grab her attention or to impress her.\n\nLittle insight into her personality is provided in the book series. Similar to her younger sister, Holly, Heather's personality and role is further enhanced in the only film adaption in which she has appeared, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.'' In a modification of the events of the books, she is depicted as the oldest daughter of the Hills family. She is spoiled, obnoxious, rude, ignorant, selfish, conceited, ungrateful, unforgiving, cold-hearted, demanding, mistreating her family and acquaintances. Lovelorn, Rodrick Heffley and his band are hired to perform at Heather's ostentatious upcoming [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sixteenth birthday party]], and, in an attempt to earn her admiration, Rodrick winds up messing up the celebration and decorations during a boisterous, and substandard performance of [[Justin Bieber]]'s \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", which makes Heather very upset and the party ends in disaster. She is portrayed by [[Melissa Roxburgh]].\n\n===Albert Sandy===\nAlbert Sandy is a minor character, who talks often about rumors he has heard. The validity of his statements are unconfirmed. One of the statements which was not confirmed by Greg was when Albert told him that \"it was medically impossible for a girl to fart\". Some make no sense, for example, he said a man got decapitated when he sneezed.\n\nAlbert has appeared in ''The Last Straw,'' ''The Ugly Truth,'' ''Old School,'' ''Double Down,'' ''The Meltdown,'' and ''Wrecking Ball.''\n\n===Mr. Ira===\nOnly appearing in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', Mr. Ira is a teacher at Greg's school who is on the school newspaper staff, and enlists a replacement comic strip for the newspaper. He was made fun of in a comic strip entitled Dumb Teachers, and later bowdlerised Greg's Creighton the Cretin comic. He does not do the same with Rowley's Zoo-Wee Mama strip, much to Greg's chagrin.\n\n===The Snellas===\nFirst appearing in ''The Last Straw'', The Snellas are a family that lives in the Heffleys' neighborhood. They have a lot of children, all of whom are male, with names beginning with the letter S. Five of the children's names are revealed, and they are (from oldest to youngest): Shawn, Shane, Sam, Scott, and Seth. In ''The Last Straw'', it is revealed that each Snella child has a half birthday party at which the adults perform funny stunts, to attempt to make the babies laugh. According to Greg, however, no baby has laughed once.\n\nMr. Snella then sends the videos to ''America's Funniest Families'', a spoof and parody of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', and has never won anything (though after Greg is filmed wearing ''Wonder Woman'' underwear hanging off a tree with his trousers below his ankles at the end of ''The Last Straw'', the footage is sent, and it is never explained if Mr. Snella won with it).\n\nTheir most recent appearance was in ''The Ugly Truth'', when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was [[deviled eggs]], which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house.\n\n===Scotty Douglas===\nScotty is a first grader from Rowley's karate class. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Scotty was going to do a magic act in the Talent Show with Rowley as his assistant. But after Greg breaks Rowley's big toe, he has to fill in for Rowley. Greg complains about being a magician's assistant to Scotty, but Susan tells Scotty's mother that Greg would be happy to replace Rowley.\n\nScotty has a remarkably similar appearance to Greg's comic character, Creighton The Cretin, except Creighton's eyes are wide open and Scotty's eyes are beady just like all the other characters that do not wear glasses. In ''The Ugly Truth'', he becomes the new Peachy Breeze kid, yet cannot say the slogan right.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> Between ''Rodrick Rules'' and ''The Ugly Truth'' it appears that Scotty has two siblings - an unnamed baby sister and an older brother. In ''The Third Wheel,'' when Greg and Rowley become private investigators Greg looks through the window at his house to find him playing one of Greg's video games with Rowley.\n\nHe appeared in the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, with only a few lines. He is portrayed by Jakob Davies.\n\n===Mr. Underwood ===\nMr. Underwood is Greg's Phys Ed coach. In the film series, he is named Coach Malone. He is portrayed by [[Andrew McNee]].\n\n===Bill Walter===\nBill Walter is a 35-year-old high school drop out, guitarist and professional singer, who has a rude attitude towards everyone he meets. Rodrick idolizes him and his lifestyle. In the novel ''Rodrick Rules'', he was voted \"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star\" which influenced Rodrick to persuade him to join the band. Frank Heffley strongly dislikes Bill because he disapproves of his lifestyle, and is afraid Rodrick will follow in his footsteps. In the movie version of ''Rodrick Rules'' he is portrayed by [[Fran Kranz]] and is an antagonist. He agrees to join Rodrick's rock band ''Loded Diper'' and later attempts to kick him out for an unknown reason. After performing the song ''Exploded Diper'', Rodrick retaliates and kicks him out. In the book Greg describes him as unemployed and still living with his parents. Also, in ''Rodrick Rules'' Bill appears to be a slob, as he \"slorks\" pot roast.\n\n===Dr. Salazar Kagan===\nDr. Kagan, Frank's dentist, makes his debut in ''The Ugly Truth''. Frank takes Greg to Dr. Kagan instead of his usual dentist, a pretty woman named Rachel on whom Greg has a crush. Greg bites Dr. Kagan's finger when his teeth are being checked. In what Greg believes to be an act of revenge, Dr. Kagan tells Frank that Greg needs headgear to correct his overbite. Greg says Dr. Kagan is scary and evil and that he never fools around. He has sharp metal tools and never smiles. The billboards for Dr. Kagan's dental practice make Greg freak out every time he sees one of them on the highway.\n\nDr. Kagan later makes a cameo in Double Down, in a scene where Greg describes how a Spineticklers book has made going to the dentist an even more frightening experience for him.\n\n===Lenwood Heath===\nLenwood Heath only appears in ''The Last Straw''. He is a rebellious teenager, who was Greg's father's arch-enemy for about three months before he was sent to military academy. This resulted in him becoming a fine young man who works at the movie theater. In the ''Dog Days'' film, he is portrayed by Tom Stevens, and is seen working as a lifeguard at the community pool the Heffleys go to.\n\n===Taylor Pringle===\nTaylor Pringle is a minor character who only appears in the films, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days'' and does not appear in the books. She is a very rude little girl, and is first seen at the end of the opening scene in ''Rodrick Rules'' in which during her [[birthday party]] at the [[roller rink]], Rodrick embarrasses Greg, prompting Greg to try and tackle him, but he misses and lands in Taylor's [[birthday cake]], destroying it. As a result of this, Taylor gets angry and she and her friends begin beating up Greg as the intro begins. Later in the film, during church, when Rodrick intentionally pulls down the sweater around Greg's waist to reveal the chocolate stain on Greg's pants, Taylor points it out to everyone, mistaking it for poop. Then, in ''Dog Days'', when Greg attempts to impress Holly by jumping off the [[high diving|high]] [[diving platform|diving board]], he becomes nervous, due to it being very high above the water. Taylor then comes up behind Greg and states that he is talking to himself, due to being scared. When Greg gives Taylor a brush-off that he is not scared and that she would not understand since she is \"just a little kid\", she pressures him to jump. When Greg jumps, he loses his [[swimsuit]] on the board, and Taylor chucks it onto a nearby fence to get back at Greg for brushing her off. As a result, Greg is forced to borrow a girl's swimsuit that reads ''Holly'' on it until he goes to the fence to retrieve his own swimsuit, and as he does so, he gets taunted by Patty. Taylor is portrayed by [[Dalila Bela]].\n\n===Jordan Jury===\nOnly appearing in ''The Ugly Truth'', Jordan Jury is the popular boy in the grade above Greg, who's known for always throwing huge parties that have little to no adult supervision. Greg is amazed when he discovers that he has been given a textbook that used to belong to him. Jordan invites Greg and Rowley to his latest party, but Greg cannot not go because of his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. But at the end of the book, Greg discovers that it's actually a good thing he didn't go to the party as it would seem. The only reason Jordan invited the kids in Greg and Rowley's grade to his party was to basically use them as servants.\n\n===Angie Steadman===\nAngie Steadman only appears as an additional character in the ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' film. She is in seventh grade, has a pink streak of hair, works for the school newspaper, and hates middle school. In the film, Greg and Rowley meet her under the bleachers during a game of \"Gladiator\". She gets along with Rowley, but starts a rocky relationship with Greg after he egotistically declines her offer to join the school newspaper. Greg later tells the whole school he ate the cheese instead of Rowley and she compliments and accepts him when she sees that Greg is learning the errors of his ways. In the film, she is portrayed by [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]].\n\n===Pete Hosey===\nPete Hosey is the leader of the teenagers who attacked Greg and Rowley on [[Halloween]]. He is an antagonist in the first film. He is unnamed in the first book and he is replaced by Herbie Reamer in the online version. After hassling Greg and Rowley on Halloween, Greg yells that he will call the cops, and they chase him to Greg's grandmother's house. In the book, Greg and Rowley sneak back home, but in the movie, they try to intimidate Pete and his friends with a weed hacker, before Pete scratches his car and they are chased into the woods. In both the book and the movie, the teens hold a vendetta against Greg and Rowley. Near the end they corner them on the school field and decide to force them to eat the moldy cheese. Rowley is forced to eat the cheese, but Greg avoids it by saying he's lactose intolerant. In the movie they are chased off by the coach.\n\n===The Warrens===\nAlthough his family is vaguely referenced in the books, the Warren's are what got Frank thinking of making Greg more manly. In the books, Mr. Warren is Frank's boss. Frank is deeply jealous of the Warrens. In stark contrast to Greg, the Warrens' children are shown to be athletic and sporty. In the third film, Stan, the father of the family, is shown to be a neighbor of the Heffleys. He had a minor childhood rivalry with Frank, that they appear to have gotten over as adults. In the movie, Mr. Warren is the troop master of the Wilderness Explorers, and invites everyone over for an Independence Day party. They only appear in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]''.\n\n===The Beardos===\nOnly appearing in ''The Long Haul'', the Beardos are the main antagonists of the book. They are a couple with three sons. The Heffleys indirectly met them during their road trip, though only Greg knows who they are. Their first encounter is at a motel, where Greg angrily berates one of the Beardo children, who then tells his father on him, causing Greg to fear running into them again. Greg and his family are convinced that the Beardos have stolen their luggage and belongings at a place they both attended called \"Soak Central.\" They try to track them down though it was revealed at the end that Greg actually had the key to their locker in Soak Central, and that he got the number in the lottery . Their belongings were actually there. The family's real surname is unknown, as Greg himself does not who they are. It is likely he dubbed them this because of the patriarch's noticeably long beard.\n\nIn the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'', Mr. and Mrs. Beardo are portrayed by [[Chris Coppola]] and Kimberli Lincoln, and have a daughter named Brandi and two sons named Brandon and Brent. The Beardos are depicted as much more malicious, with Mr. Beardo chasing Greg around through the carnival to get revenge.\n\n===Chris=== \nChris is a friend of Rodrick and the [[bassist]] in Loded Diper.\n\n===Joshie===\nJoshie is a singer who is famous in Europe and is Rowley's favorite singer and idol. Greg believes that Joshie is for six-year-old girls, but Rowley ignores him, saying that Greg is jealous because he was the one who \"discovered\" Joshie. However, despite Rowley's opinion, Joshie appears to be a singer that is mainly idolized by females.\n\n===Maddox Selsam===\nMaddox Selsam is a boy who lives in the middle of the woods. He is not allowed to have any screen time, and does not have a TV at his house. He enjoys playing with his Legos and practicing his violin. He met Greg in ''Double Down'' when he found Greg's balloon for the Balloon Brigade at his school.\n==Pets==\n\n===Dogs===\n====Sweetie====\nSweetie is a dog that first appeared in ''Dog Days''. Greg's dad buys him after discovering that his father lied about accidentally killing his childhood dog, Nutty. Sweetie wreaks havoc in the Heffley household and is given to Gramma at the end of the book. Sweetie undergoes drastic weight gain at Gramma's house because he is fed lots of table scraps. Eventually Gramma dresses him up like a little human. Greg and Rodrick like playing with him by going up behind him and making flatulence sounds. He will then sniff his rear end until he goes to sleep.\n\n====Nutty====\nNutty is Frank's old dog which he had when he was around Greg's age. Grandpa accidentally ran over and killed Nutty with his station wagon when he backed out of the driveway. Grandpa covered the truth by saying that Nutty ran away to a butterfly farm. Frank is very angry when he finds out the truth during a Father's Day brunch.\n\n====Killer====\nKiller is Joe Heffley's [[Rottweiler]]-type pet dog. In ''Dog Days'', he wreaks havoc by eating most of Greg's birthday cake, leaving Greg not wanting to eat it.\n\n====Rudy====\nRudy was Aunt Cakey's dog. He was usually oblivious to what was going on around him, opting to stare straight ahead doing nothing. It is not known how Rudy died.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is Gramma's dog who died around the time of the dog days of summer.\n\n====Rebel====\nRebel is a [[Rottweiler]] that used to chase Greg and Rowley on their way to school before his owner installed an electric fence around the front yard. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Fish===\n====Greg's Fish====\nIn ''Dog Days'', Greg buys an angel fish from a pet store. He also buys a journal to log the actions of his fish but later realizes he can not put much in it. Greg's fish was later made to share a tank with Rodrick's fish, who ate it while Greg and his family were at the water park on [[Father's Day]].\n\n====Rodrick's Fish====\nRodrick's fish is a [[piranha]]-type fish that was picked out the fish at a pet store in ''Dog Days,'' because it was described as aggressive. Due to Rodrick's neglect at cleaning the tank it was made to share a tank with Greg's fish, which it ate. The fish has not appeared since ''Dog Days,'' with no further mention of its eventual fate.\n\n===Other Pets===\n====Aunt Gretchen's pets====\nAunt Gretchen has about thirty pets that the Heffleys pet-sit in ''Hard Luck'', while she is on vacation. Her pets include three dogs, two cats, a mouse, a parakeet, a turtle, a snake, a lizard, and a litter of bunnies that her rabbit gave birth to while Gretchen was away (despite the fact that the rabbit was actually male).\n\n====Squirm====\nSquirm was an inchworm Greg found and took care of when he was nine. It was stood on and squashed by Manny when he began learning how to walk.\n\n====The Pig====\nThe Heffleys\u2019 pet pig has appeared in all books except ''The Getaway'' since ''The Long Haul'', in which Manny Heffley won it at a country fair for correctly guessing the weight of a hog. To the annoyance of Greg, the pig exhibits extraordinary intelligence and gains human characteristics. One running gag is that despite not having opposable thumbs, the pig opens objects such as soda cans. In ''The Meltdown'' the Pig throws a tantrum for being excluded from the trip to Isla de Corales in ''The Getaway''. Frank sends it to obedience school, only for the Pig to escape on its second day there. The Pig is never found by the Heffleys despite numerous missing posters, and the pig's fate is left unclear.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]\n[[Category:Diary of a Wimpy Kid (series)]]\n", "name_user": "70.93.75.25", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 948401924 byMrJaroslavik(talk))", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid_characters"}
