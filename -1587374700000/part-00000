His other work includes the score of the 1985 film ''[[Return to Oz]]'' (the \"sequel-in-part\" of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''), and the stage musical scores of ''[[Baby (musical)|Baby]]'', ''[[Big: the musical|Big]]'', ''[[Closer Than Ever]]'', and ''[[Starting Here, Starting Now]]''.  Shire is married to actress [[Didi Conn]].\n\n==Education and early career==\nShire was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], to Esther Miriam ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Sheinberg) and Buffalo society band leader and piano teacher Irving Daniel Shire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/35/David-Shire.html |title=David Shire Biography (1937-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref> His family was Jewish. His secondary education was at the [[Nichols School]]. He met his long-time theater collaborator lyricist/director [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] at [[Yale University]], where they wrote two musicals, ''Cyrano'' and ''Grand Tour'', which were produced by the [[Yale Dramatic Association]]. Shire also co-fronted a jazz group at school, the Shire-Fogg Quintet, and was a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] honors student, with a double major in English and music. He was a member of the Pundits and [[Elihu (secret society)|Elihu]] and he graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1959.\n\nAfter a semester of graduate work at [[Brandeis University]] (where he was the first [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] Fellow) and six months in the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] infantry, Shire took up residence in New York City, working as a dance class pianist, theater rehearsal and pit pianist, and society band musician while constantly working with Maltby on musicals. Their first [[off-Broadway]] show, ''The Sap of Life'', was produced in 1961 at One Sheridan Square Theater in [[Greenwich Village]].  He co-wrote [[The Village Stompers]]' \"[[Washington Square (composition)|Washington Square]]\" with [[Bobb Goldsteinn|Bob Goldstein]] in 1963.\n\n==Film and television scoring==\nShire began scoring for television in the 1960s and made the leap to scoring [[feature film]]s in the early 1970s. He was then married to actress [[Talia Shire]], for whose brother [[Francis Ford Coppola]] he scored ''[[The Conversation]]'', perhaps his best known score, in 1974. Additional screen credits include ''[[Two People (1973 film)|Two People]]'', ''[[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|The Taking of Pelham One Two Three]]'', ''[[The Hindenburg (1975 film)|The Hindenburg]]'', ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]'', ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All The President's Men]]'', ''[[The Big Bus]]'', ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]'', ''[[Return to Oz]]'', ''[[Short Circuit (1986 film)|Short Circuit]]'', ''[[Max Dugan Returns]]'', and ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]''. He composed [[Saturday Night Fever: The Original Movie Sound Track|original music]] for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (for which he received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations), and also worked on several disco adaptations including \"[[Night on Bald Mountain|Night on Disco Mountain]].\" He won the [[Academy Award for Best Song]] in 1979 for his and [[Norman Gimbel]]'s theme song for ''[[Norma Rae]],'' \"[[It Goes Like It Goes]].\" He was also nominated the same year in the same category for \"I'll Never Say Goodbye,\" from the motion picture ''[[The Promise (1979 film)|The Promise]],'' with lyrics jointly written by [[Marilyn Bergman|Marilyn]] and [[Alan Bergman]]. In 1979 his song \"[[With You I'm Born Again]],\" recorded by [[Billy Preston]] and [[Syreeta Wright|Syreeta]], was a top five international hit and stayed on the pop charts for 26 weeks. {{citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n''[[The Conversation]]'' featured a score for piano. On some cues, Shire took the taped sounds of the piano and distorted them in different ways to create alternative sonic textures to round out the score. The music is intended to capture the isolation and paranoia of protagonist Harry Caul ([[Gene Hackman]]). The score was released on CD by [[Intrada Records]].\n\nFor the \"Main Title\" of ''[[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|The Taking of Pelham One Two Three]],'' Shire set a jazz-funk groove in B-flat minor, and made the lead melodies and chords out of atonal [[twelve-tone]] rows in short bursts of variously shaped motives.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The soundtrack album was the first-ever CD release by ''[[Film Score Monthly]].'' The end titles contain a more expansive arrangement of the theme.\n\nShire's television scores have earned five [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006288/awards |title=Awards|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref> His hundreds of scores for television include: ''[[Killer Bees (1974 film)|Killer Bees]]''; ''[[Raid on Entebbe (film)|Raid on Entebbe]]''; ''[[The Kennedys of Massachusetts]];'' ''[[Serving in Silence|Serving In Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story]];'' [[Christopher Reeve]]'s ''[[Rear Window (1998 film)|Rear Window]]''; [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s ''[[The Women of Brewster Place (1989 television)|The Women of Brewster Place]];'' and ''[[The Heidi Chronicles (film)|The Heidi Chronicles]].'' He also composed themes for the television series ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' and ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'' and the 1976-1977 [[Danny Thomas]] situation comedy ''[[The Practice (1976 TV series)|The Practice]]''.\n\nShire's film and television scoring style is often compared to his late counterpart and contemporary [[Jerry Fielding]].\n\n==Musical theatre==\n[[File:David Shire03.JPG|thumb|300px|Shire at [[Barnes & Noble]], New York with vocalist Sal Viviano.]]\nAs a pit pianist, Shire played for the original productions of both ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' and ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'', eventually serving as [[Barbra Streisand]]\u2019s accompanist for several years. He also intermittently conducted and arranged for her (most notably for her television specials ''[[Color Me Barbra]]'' and ''The Belle of Fourteenth Street''), and over a period of several years she recorded five of his songs.\n\nShire's musical theatre work, always in collaboration with lyricist [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] includes the two off-Broadway revues ''[[Starting Here, Starting Now]]'' ([[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album|Best Cast Album]]) and ''[[Closer Than Ever]]'' (Outer Critic's Circle Award for Best Musical) and the two Broadway shows ''[[Baby (musical)|Baby]]'' ([[Tony Award|Tony]] nominations for [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]] and [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Score]]) and ''[[Big (musical)|Big]]'' (Tony nomination for Best Score).  All of these shows have had hundreds of regional and stock productions worldwide. A new musical entitled ''[[Take Flight (musical)|Take Flight]]'' premiered in London at the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] in July 2007, with a separate production in Tokyo in November 2007. Previously concert versions were performed in Australia and Russia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/109510.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910083409/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/109510.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-10 |title=Take Flight Takes Off at London's Menier Chocolate Factory July 13 |publisher=Playbill.com |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2014-08-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2004/29_Jun---David_Shire_Interview.asp |title=6/30/04: David Shire Interview |publisher=Filmscoremonthly.com |accessdate=2014-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808060126/http://filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2004/29_Jun---David_Shire_Interview.asp |archivedate=2014-08-08 }}</ref>\n\n''A Stream of Voices'', a one-act opera, with libretto by [[Gene Scheer]], for the [[Colorado Children's Chorale]], premiered in June 2008 in [[Denver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/spotlight_columnists/article/0,2777,DRMN_23962_5649161,00.html |accessdate=January 30, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nOn October 27, 2012, the Broadway-style musical ''Loving the Silent Tears'' premiered in Los Angeles, including some songs composed by Shire.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Liz-Callaway-Debbie-Gravitte-Jon-Secada-and-More-Set-for-LOVING-THE-SILENT-TEARS-in-LA-1027-20120808#sthash.XlzDBxZl.dpbs |title=Liz Callaway, Debbie Gravitte, Jon Secada and More Set for LOVING THE SILENT TEARS in LA, 10/27 |publisher=Broadwayworld.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref><ref>[http://www.silenttearsmusical.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926064004/http://www.silenttearsmusical.com/ |date=September 26, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Miscellaneous==\nShire has conducted many orchestras, either for film scores or for pop concerts, including the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], The [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the [[San Francisco Opera|San Francisco Opera Orchestra]], the [[Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[Munich Symphony]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nShire wrote and composed many songs for the hit [[Public Broadcast Service|PBS]] children's TV series ''[[Shining Time Station]]'', which starred his wife [[Didi Conn]] along with comedian [[George Carlin]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nShire serves on the council of the [[Dramatists Guild of America]] and is a trustee of the Rockland Conservatory of Music and the Palisades (New York) Library.

His other work includes the score of the 1985 film ''[[Return to Oz]]'' (the \"sequel-in-part\" of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''), and the stage musical scores of ''[[Baby (musical)|Baby]]'', ''[[Big: the musical|Big]]'', ''[[Closer Than Ever]]'', and ''[[Starting Here, Starting Now]]''.  Shire is married to actress [[Didi Conn]].\n\n==Education and early career==\nShire was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], to Esther Miriam ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Sheinberg) and Buffalo society band leader and piano teacher Irving Daniel Shire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/35/David-Shire.html |title=David Shire Biography (1937-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref> His family was Jewish. His secondary education was at the [[Nichols School]]. He met his long-time theater collaborator lyricist/director [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] at [[Yale University]], where they wrote two musicals, ''Cyrano'' and ''Grand Tour'', which were produced by the [[Yale Dramatic Association]]. Shire also co-fronted a jazz group at school, the Shire-Fogg Quintet, and was a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] honors student, with a double major in English and music. He was a member of the Pundits and [[Elihu (secret society)|Elihu]] and he graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1959.\n\nAfter a semester of graduate work at [[Brandeis University]] (where he was the first [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] Fellow) and six months in the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] infantry, Shire took up residence in New York City, working as a dance class pianist, theater rehearsal and pit pianist, and society band musician while constantly working with Maltby on musicals. Their first [[off-Broadway]] show, ''The Sap of Life'', was produced in 1961 at One Sheridan Square Theater in [[Greenwich Village]].  He co-wrote [[The Village Stompers]]' \"[[Washington Square (composition)|Washington Square]]\" with [[Bobb Goldsteinn|Bob Goldstein]] in 1963.\n\n==Film and television scoring==\nShire began scoring for television in the 1960s and made the leap to scoring [[feature film]]s in the early 1970s. He was then married to actress [[Talia Shire]], for whose brother [[Francis Ford Coppola]] he scored ''[[The Conversation]]'', perhaps his best known score, in 1974. Additional screen credits include ''[[Two People (1973 film)|Two People]]'', ''[[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|The Taking of Pelham One Two Three]]'', ''[[The Hindenburg (1975 film)|The Hindenburg]]'', ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]'', ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All The President's Men]]'', ''[[The Big Bus]]'', ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]'', ''[[Return to Oz]]'', ''[[Short Circuit (1986 film)|Short Circuit]]'', ''[[Max Dugan Returns]]'', and ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]''. He composed [[Saturday Night Fever: The Original Movie Sound Track|original music]] for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (for which he received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations), and also worked on several disco adaptations including \"[[Night on Bald Mountain|Night on Disco Mountain]].\" He won the [[Academy Award for Best Song]] in 1979 for his and [[Norman Gimbel]]'s theme song for ''[[Norma Rae]],'' \"[[It Goes Like It Goes]].\" He was also nominated the same year in the same category for \"I'll Never Say Goodbye,\" from the motion picture ''[[The Promise (1979 film)|The Promise]],'' with lyrics jointly written by [[Marilyn Bergman|Marilyn]] and [[Alan Bergman]]. In 1979 his song \"[[With You I'm Born Again]],\" recorded by [[Billy Preston]] and [[Syreeta Wright|Syreeta]], was a top five international hit and stayed on the pop charts for 26 weeks. {{citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n''[[The Conversation]]'' featured a score for piano. On some cues, Shire took the taped sounds of the piano and distorted them in different ways to create alternative sonic textures to round out the score. The music is intended to capture the isolation and paranoia of protagonist Harry Caul ([[Gene Hackman]]). The score was released on CD by [[Intrada Records]].\n\nFor the \"Main Title\" of ''[[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|The Taking of Pelham One Two Three]],'' Shire set a jazz-funk groove in B-flat minor, and made the lead melodies and chords out of atonal [[twelve-tone]] rows in short bursts of variously shaped motives.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The soundtrack album was the first-ever CD release by ''[[Film Score Monthly]].'' The end titles contain a more expansive arrangement of the theme.\n\nShire's television scores have earned five [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006288/awards |title=Awards|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref> His hundreds of scores for television include: ''[[Killer Bees (1974 film)|Killer Bees]]''; ''[[Raid on Entebbe (film)|Raid on Entebbe]]''; ''[[The Kennedys of Massachusetts]];'' ''[[Serving in Silence|Serving In Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story]];'' [[Christopher Reeve]]'s ''[[Rear Window (1998 film)|Rear Window]]''; [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s ''[[The Women of Brewster Place (1989 television)|The Women of Brewster Place]];'' and ''[[The Heidi Chronicles (film)|The Heidi Chronicles]].'' He also composed themes for the television series ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' and ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'' and the 1976-1977 [[Danny Thomas]] situation comedy ''[[The Practice (1976 TV series)|The Practice]]''.\n\nShire's film and television scoring style is often compared to his late counterpart and contemporary [[Jerry Fielding]].\n\n==Musical theatre==\n[[File:David Shire03.JPG|thumb|300px|Shire at [[Barnes & Noble]], New York with vocalist Sal Viviano.]]\nAs a pit pianist, Shire played for the original productions of both ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' and ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'', eventually serving as [[Barbra Streisand]]\u2019s accompanist for several years. He also intermittently conducted and arranged for her (most notably for her television specials ''[[Color Me Barbra]]'' and ''The Belle of Fourteenth Street''), and over a period of several years she recorded five of his songs.\n\nShire's musical theatre work, always in collaboration with lyricist [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] includes the two off-Broadway revues ''[[Starting Here, Starting Now]]'' ([[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album|Best Cast Album]]) and ''[[Closer Than Ever]]'' (Outer Critic's Circle Award for Best Musical) and the two Broadway shows ''[[Baby (musical)|Baby]]'' ([[Tony Award|Tony]] nominations for [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]] and [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Score]]) and ''[[Big (musical)|Big]]'' (Tony nomination for Best Score).  All of these shows have had hundreds of regional and stock productions worldwide. A new musical entitled ''[[Take Flight (musical)|Take Flight]]'' premiered in London at the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] in July 2007, with a separate production in Tokyo in November 2007. Previously concert versions were performed in Australia and Russia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/109510.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910083409/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/109510.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-10 |title=Take Flight Takes Off at London's Menier Chocolate Factory July 13 |publisher=Playbill.com |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2014-08-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2004/29_Jun---David_Shire_Interview.asp |title=6/30/04: David Shire Interview |publisher=Filmscoremonthly.com |accessdate=2014-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808060126/http://filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2004/29_Jun---David_Shire_Interview.asp |archivedate=2014-08-08 }}</ref>\n\n''A Stream of Voices'', a one-act opera, with libretto by [[Gene Scheer]], for the [[Colorado Children's Chorale]], premiered in June 2008 in [[Denver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/spotlight_columnists/article/0,2777,DRMN_23962_5649161,00.html |accessdate=January 30, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nOn October 27, 2012, the Broadway-style musical ''Loving the Silent Tears'' premiered in Los Angeles, including some songs composed by Shire.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Liz-Callaway-Debbie-Gravitte-Jon-Secada-and-More-Set-for-LOVING-THE-SILENT-TEARS-in-LA-1027-20120808#sthash.XlzDBxZl.dpbs |title=Liz Callaway, Debbie Gravitte, Jon Secada and More Set for LOVING THE SILENT TEARS in LA, 10/27 |publisher=Broadwayworld.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref><ref>[http://www.silenttearsmusical.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926064004/http://www.silenttearsmusical.com/ |date=September 26, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Miscellaneous==\nShire has conducted many orchestras, either for film scores or for pop concerts, including the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], The [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the [[San Francisco Opera|San Francisco Opera Orchestra]], the [[Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[Munich Symphony]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nShire wrote and composed many songs for the hit [[Public Broadcast Service|PBS]] children's TV series ''[[Shining Time Station]]'', which starred his wife [[Didi Conn]] along with comedian [[George Carlin]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nShire serves on the council of the [[Dramatists Guild of America]] and is a trustee of the Rockland Conservatory of Music and the Palisades (New York) Library.

The stadium with its reduced capacity from 2008 can hold 10,850 people<ref>[[NK Lokomotiva Zagreb]]</ref>, which makes it the second biggest stadium in [[Zagreb]], behind [[Stadion Maksimir]]. In 2018 the stadium was refurbished with chairs installed in the eastern grandstand and a new hybrid lawn installed<ref>http://www.sportskiobjekti.hr/default.aspx?id=8395</ref>. The stadium now has a seating capacity of 5,350 seats.<ref>http://www.sportskiobjekti.hr/default.aspx?id=8395</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe stadium at what was then called ''Tratinska cesta'' ({{lang-en|Tratinska road}}) began construction in 1910s and was completed in 1921. At the time of its completion it was the biggest stadium in [[Zagreb]] and was owned by [[H\u0160K Concordia|Concordia]], one of the three prominent [[Zagreb]]-based football clubs in the [[interwar period]] (the other two being [[Gra\u0111anski Zagreb|Gra\u0111anski]] and [[HA\u0160K]]). In 1931 the first [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlit]] match held in [[Zagreb]] was played at the stadium, in which Zagreb XI beat [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] 2\u20131, with two goals from [[Ico Hitrec]] and a consolation goal for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Madrid]] scored by [[Eugenio Hilario Calvo|Eugenio]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], [[H\u0160K Concordia|Concordia]] was disbanded for political reasons and the stadium was handed over to the newly formed ''Fiskulturno dru\u0161tvo Zagreb'' ({{lang-en|Zagreb Sports Society}}), whose football section later evolved into today's [[NK Zagreb]] football club. [[NK Zagreb]]'s third jersey is green in honour of [[H\u0160K Concordia|Concordia]], whose old stadium is now their own.\n\nIn November 1977 a large fire destroyed the west stand and in the following years the stadium went through several reconstructions and modifications. The most significant of these was an extensive overhaul and the construction of the adjoining facilities in preparation for the [[1987 Summer Universiade]]. Later that year a lightning strike destroyed the [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] during a match between [[NK Zagreb]] and [[NK Osijek]] and the stadium was without any [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlight]] capabilities for 20 years, until 2008, when the new ones were re-installed by the [[Zagreb|City of Zagreb]].\n\n===Croatian War of Independence===\n\n[[File:ZNG spomen plo\u010da Kranjceviceva.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Plaque commemorating the 1991 [[Croatian National Guard]] parade.]]At the onset of the [[Croatian War of Independence]] one of the most significant date in the history of the stadium is the first public lineup of the [[Croatian National Guard]] ({{lang-hr|Zbor narodne Garde}}), formed in April that year, consisting of members of the police and part of the [[Croatian Army|Croatian army]] on 28 May 1991. which was the first [[Croatia|Croatia's]] professional military unit and which later evolved into the [[Croatian Ground Army]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska kopnena vojska}}).That marked the beginning of the creation of the [[Croatian Army|Croatian Armed Forces]]. A [[commemorative plaque]] honouring the event can be seen at the stadium entrance.<ref name=\"Stadion u Kranj\u010devi\u0107evoj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nkzagreb.hr/main.asp?dir=oklubu&vijestid=15|title=Stadion u Kranj\u010devi\u0107evoj|trans-title=Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva Street Stadium|publisher=[[NK Zagreb|nkzagreb.hr]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=15 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029171326/http://www.nkzagreb.hr/main.asp?dir=oklubu&vijestid=15|archivedate=29 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\nToday's shape and form of venue in [[Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107|Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva]] Street is due to another unfortunate event in its history. On 29 November 1977 a fire destroyed large sections of old wooden western stand of the stadium in [[Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107|Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva]]. Since that time, the stadium in [[Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107|Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva]] experienced several modifications and reconstructions in the following years. Most of infrastructure was built in the preparation of the [[1987 Summer Universiade|Universiade]] in [[Zagreb]], the world's [[1987 Summer Universiade|Student Games]] held in 1987<ref name=\"Stadion u Kranj\u010devi\u0107evoj\"/> such as extensive overhaul and the construction of the adjoining facilities. Later that same year a lightning strike wreck the floodlights and the stadium was without any floodlight capabilities for 20 years, when new ones were installed by the [[Zagreb|City of Zagreb]]. The stadium consists of two stands. The west stand is fully seated and can hold 3,850 spectators. It houses the [[press box]] and the VIP area. The east stand has 5,000 standing places and is mainly used for travelling fans. The stadium also has a [[track cycling|cycling track]] around the pitch which is used for [[track cycling]] events.<ref name=\"Stadion u Kranj\u010devi\u0107evoj\"/> Furthermore, the stadium has a [[wheelchair]] area. In June 2008 [[UEFA]] inspection in charge of licensing have visited the stadium and gave minor praise for the stadium in the [[Zagreb|city center]]. Among the major cons pointed out by the [[UEFA]] inspection were lack of [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] and poor working conditions for journalists. Even though [[Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107|Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva]] failed to impress the [[UEFA]] delegation due to lack of [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] (which were installed two months later) and [[press box]] provisions it managed to receive a 3-star rating out of five, which ranks it among the better stadiums in [[Croatia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportnet.hr/Vijest.aspx?ID=361149|first=Michaela|last=Bradovski|title=Pripreme po\u010dinju u srijedu|trans-title=Preparations starting on Wednesday|publisher=[[Sportnet.hr|hrsport.net]]|language=Croatian|date=9 June 2008|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> After infrastructure renovations which were held by the [[Zagreb|City of Zagreb]] through June, July and August 2008 [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] were finally reinstalled and fully prepared three days before the 5th round and match [[NK Zagreb]] - [[NK Osijek]] played on 24 August 2008.<ref name=\"Stadion u Kranj\u010devi\u0107evoj\"/> [[NK Zagreb|Zagreb]] eventually won its first match under the [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] at [[Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107|Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva]] since 1987 when they were struck by lightning during a match between [[NK Zagreb]] and the same opponent [[NK Osijek]] 2-1 thanks to goals from [[Mario \u010cutura]] and [[Davor Vugrinec]] in the last minute in front of 2,500 supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/364520/nogomet-1-hnl/gosti-povukli-bijele-do-pobjede/|first=Michaela|last=Bradovski|title=Premijera pod reflektorima|trans-title=The premiere under floodlights|publisher=[[Sportnet.hr|hrsport.net]]|language=Croatian|date=24 August 2008|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> Since then, thanks to newly placed [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] at venue in [[Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107|Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva]] Street, stadium is capable of playing a daylight and night matches.<ref name=\"Stadion u Kranj\u010devi\u0107evoj\"/> In 2018 the stadium was refurbished with chairs installed in the eastern grandstand and a new hybrid lawn installed<ref>http://www.sportskiobjekti.hr/default.aspx?id=8395</ref>.

Between 1922 and 1940 the stadium hosted a total of 11 Kingdom of Yugoslavia matches, most of them friendlies. During World War II, the fascist [[puppet state]] [[Independent State of Croatia]] formed a national team which used the stadium for six games, all of them friendlies played with other [[Axis powers]]' puppet states.\n\nIn 1947 Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva hosted their single international game in the [[SFR Yugoslavia]] period, a 2\u20131 [[Balkan Cup]] win against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]], with both Yugoslavia's goals scored by [[Prvoslav Mihajlovi\u0107]]. Following Croatia's independence in 1991, the [[Croatia national football team]] played at Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva only once, in a 1996 friendly against [[South Korea]] which Croatia won 3\u20130 through a [[hat-trick]] from [[Goran Vlaovi\u0107]].\n\n===List of matches===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;

The stadium with its reduced capacity from 2008 can hold 10,850 people<ref>[[NK Lokomotiva Zagreb]]</ref>, which makes it the second biggest stadium in [[Zagreb]], behind [[Stadion Maksimir]]. In 2018 the stadium was refurbished with chairs installed in the eastern grandstand and a new hybrid lawn installed<ref>http://www.sportskiobjekti.hr/default.aspx?id=8395</ref>. The stadium now has a seating capacity of 5,350 seats.<ref>http://www.sportskiobjekti.hr/default.aspx?id=8395</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe stadium at what was then called ''Tratinska cesta'' ({{lang-en|Tratinska road}}) began construction in 1910s and was completed in 1921. At the time of its completion it was the biggest stadium in [[Zagreb]] and was owned by [[H\u0160K Concordia|Concordia]], one of the three prominent [[Zagreb]]-based football clubs in the [[interwar period]] (the other two being [[Gra\u0111anski Zagreb|Gra\u0111anski]] and [[HA\u0160K]]). In 1931 the first [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlit]] match held in [[Zagreb]] was played at the stadium, in which Zagreb XI beat [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] 2\u20131, with two goals from [[Ico Hitrec]] and a consolation goal for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Madrid]] scored by [[Eugenio Hilario Calvo|Eugenio]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], [[H\u0160K Concordia|Concordia]] was disbanded for political reasons and the stadium was handed over to the newly formed ''Fiskulturno dru\u0161tvo Zagreb'' ({{lang-en|Zagreb Sports Society}}), whose football section later evolved into today's [[NK Zagreb]] football club. [[NK Zagreb]]'s third jersey is green in honour of [[H\u0160K Concordia|Concordia]], whose old stadium is now their own.\n\nIn November 1977 a large fire destroyed the west stand and in the following years the stadium went through several reconstructions and modifications. The most significant of these was an extensive overhaul and the construction of the adjoining facilities in preparation for the [[1987 Summer Universiade]]. Later that year a lightning strike destroyed the [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] during a match between [[NK Zagreb]] and [[NK Osijek]] and the stadium was without any [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlight]] capabilities for 20 years, until 2008, when the new ones were re-installed by the [[Zagreb|City of Zagreb]].\n\n===Croatian War of Independence===\n\n[[File:ZNG spomen plo\u010da Kranjceviceva.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Plaque commemorating the 1991 [[Croatian National Guard]] parade.]]At the onset of the [[Croatian War of Independence]] one of the most significant date in the history of the stadium is the first public lineup of the [[Croatian National Guard]] ({{lang-hr|Zbor narodne Garde}}), formed in April that year, consisting of members of the police and part of the [[Croatian Army|Croatian army]] on 28 May 1991. which was the first [[Croatia|Croatia's]] professional military unit and which later evolved into the [[Croatian Ground Army]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska kopnena vojska}}).That marked the beginning of the creation of the [[Croatian Army|Croatian Armed Forces]].

On 29 November 1977 a fire destroyed large sections of old wooden western stand of the stadium in [[Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107|Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva]]. Since that time, the stadium in [[Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107|Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva]] experienced several modifications and reconstructions in the following years. Most of infrastructure was built in the preparation of the [[1987 Summer Universiade|Universiade]] in [[Zagreb]], the world's [[1987 Summer Universiade|Student Games]] held in 1987<ref name=\"Stadion u Kranj\u010devi\u0107evoj\"/> such as extensive overhaul and the construction of the adjoining facilities. Later that same year a lightning strike wreck the floodlights and the stadium was without any floodlight capabilities for 20 years, when new ones were installed by the [[Zagreb|City of Zagreb]]. The stadium consists of two stands. The west stand is fully seated and can hold 3,850 spectators. It houses the [[press box]] and the VIP area. The east stand has 5,000 standing places and is mainly used for travelling fans. The stadium also has a [[track cycling|cycling track]] around the pitch which is used for [[track cycling]] events.<ref name=\"Stadion u Kranj\u010devi\u0107evoj\"/> Furthermore, the stadium has a [[wheelchair]] area. In June 2008 [[UEFA]] inspection in charge of licensing have visited the stadium and gave minor praise for the stadium in the [[Zagreb|city center]]. Among the major cons pointed out by the [[UEFA]] inspection were lack of [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] and poor working conditions for journalists. Even though [[Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107|Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva]] failed to impress the [[UEFA]] delegation due to lack of [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] (which were installed two months later) and [[press box]] provisions it managed to receive a 3-star rating out of five, which ranks it among the better stadiums in [[Croatia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportnet.hr/Vijest.aspx?ID=361149|first=Michaela|last=Bradovski|title=Pripreme po\u010dinju u srijedu|trans-title=Preparations starting on Wednesday|publisher=[[Sportnet.hr|hrsport.net]]|language=Croatian|date=9 June 2008|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> After infrastructure renovations which were held by the [[Zagreb|City of Zagreb]] through June, July and August 2008 [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] were finally reinstalled and fully prepared three days before the 5th round and match [[NK Zagreb]] - [[NK Osijek]] played on 24 August 2008.<ref name=\"Stadion u Kranj\u010devi\u0107evoj\"/> [[NK Zagreb|Zagreb]] eventually won its first match under the [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] at [[Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107|Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva]] since 1987 when they were struck by lightning during a match between [[NK Zagreb]] and the same opponent [[NK Osijek]] 2-1 thanks to goals from [[Mario \u010cutura]] and [[Davor Vugrinec]] in the last minute in front of 2,500 supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/364520/nogomet-1-hnl/gosti-povukli-bijele-do-pobjede/|first=Michaela|last=Bradovski|title=Premijera pod reflektorima|trans-title=The premiere under floodlights|publisher=[[Sportnet.hr|hrsport.net]]|language=Croatian|date=24 August 2008|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> Since then, thanks to newly placed [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] at venue in [[Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107|Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva]] Street, stadium is capable of playing a daylight and night matches.<ref name=\"Stadion u Kranj\u010devi\u0107evoj\"/>\n\n==Average attendances==\n\nThe average season attendances from league matches held at the Stadion u Kranj\u010devi\u0107evoj for [[NK Zagreb]]<ref name=\"Average attendances\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrnogomet.com/hnl/stadionKlub.php?id=7&klub=2 |title=Prikaz stadiona po prvenstvima i klubu |publisher=hrnogomet.com |accessdate=6 March 2013|language=Croatian}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center width=45%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| '''Season'''\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| '''NK Zagreb'''\n|-\n|align=center|1992\n|align=center|3,773\n|-\n|align=center|1992\u201393\n|align=center|5,467\n|-\n|align=center|1993\u201394\n|align=center|2,706\n|-\n|align=center|1994\u201395\n|align=center|3,100\n|-\n|align=center|1995\u201396\n|align=center|2,767\n|-\n|align=center|1996\u201397\n|align=center|1,633\n|-\n|align=center|1997\u201398\n|align=center|1,820\n|-\n|align=center|1998\u201399\n|align=center|1,547\n|-\n|align=center|1999\u20132000\n|align=center|1,106\n|-\n|align=center|2000\u201301\n|align=center|1,831\n|-\n|align=center|2001\u201302\n|align=center|2,800\n|-\n|align=center|2002\u201303\n|align=center|1,830\n|-\n|align=center|2003\u201304\n|align=center|1,569\n|-\n|align=center|2004\u201305\n|align=center|1,831\n|-\n|align=center|2005\u201306\n|align=center|1,469\n|-\n|align=center|2006\u201307\n|align=center|1,965\n|-\n|align=center|2007\u201308\n|align=center|1,200\n|-\n|align=center|2008\u201309\n|align=center|867\n|-\n|align=center|2009\u201310\n|align=center|1,240\n|-\n|align=center|2010\u201311\n|align=center|1,121\n|-\n|align=center|2011\u201312\n|align=center|933\n|-\n|align=center|2012\u201313\n|align=center|1,263\n|-\n|}\n\n==International matches==\n\nThe first international match at the stadium was held in June 1922, a friendly between [[Yugoslavia national football team|Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. The Yugoslavia team consisted almost entirely of players called up from [[Zagreb]] clubs (only the goalkeeper Rodoljub Malen\u010di\u0107 was called up from [[Belgrade]]'s [[SK Jugoslavija]]) and Yugoslavia went on to win the game 4\u20133, with some 6,000 people in attendance. Between 1922 and 1940 the stadium hosted a total of 11 Kingdom of Yugoslavia matches, most of them friendlies. During World War II, the fascist [[puppet state]] [[Independent State of Croatia]] formed a national team which used the stadium for six games, all of them friendlies played with other [[Axis powers]]' puppet states.\n\nIn 1947 Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva hosted their single international game in the [[SFR Yugoslavia]] period, a 2\u20131 [[Balkan Cup]] win against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]], with both Yugoslavia's goals scored by [[Prvoslav Mihajlovi\u0107]]. Following Croatia's independence in 1991, the [[Croatia national football team]] played at Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva only once, in a 1996 friendly against [[South Korea]] which Croatia won 3\u20130 through a [[hat-trick]] from [[Goran Vlaovi\u0107]].\n\n===List of matches===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;
