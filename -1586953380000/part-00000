It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Fantasm Comes Again]]'', the following year, directed by a pseudonymous [[Colin Eggleston]].\n\n==Plot==\nGerman psychiatrist Professor Jurgen Notafreud takes the audience through a series of female sexual fantasies including:\n*sex in a beauty salon\n*fruit fetishism\n*lesbianism in a sauna\n*teacher student seduction\n*rape in a gym\n*transvestism\n*reverse [[Oedipus complex]] ([[Electra complex]])\n\n==Cast==\n*Dee Dee Levitt as Abby\n*Maria Arnold as Barbara\n*Bill Margold as husband\n*Gretchen Gayle as Gabrielle\n*[[Rene Bond]] as Dianne\n*Al Williams as rapist\n*Con Covert as transvestite\n*Mara Lutra as Felicity\n*[[Uschi Digart]] as Super Girl\n*Maria Welton as Irish\n*[[John Holmes (pornographic actor)|John Holmes]] as Neptune\n*Mary Gavin (Candy Samples) as Belle\n*Gene Allan Poe as son\n*Robert Savage as visitor 1\n*Kirby Hall as visitor 2\n*Shayne as Celeste\n*Sue Doloria as Harriet\n*Al Ward as teacher\n*Clement St George as Satanist\n*Serena as victim\n*[[John Bluthal]] as Professor Jurgen Notafreud\n\n==Production==\nIn 1974 and 1975 Antony I Ginnane decided to enter the production field. He attempted to set up a [[Roger Corman]] type \"nurses\" film which he would produce and direct budgeted at $250,000 and then a crime drama set against the background of the massage parlour business called ''Sexy Little Me'' budgeted at $150,000, but was unable to find the money. However he could raise $50,000 and allocated directing duties to Richard Franklin, with whom Ginnane had worked with on the overseas marketing for ''[[The True Story of Eskimo Nell]]''.<ref name=\"ginnane\"/>\n\nFranklin and Ginnane wanted to make something commercial so their options were a bikie, horror or sex film. They decided to make a sex film with Franklin pushing to make it more of a comedy. [[Ross Dimsey]] wrote a script, originally called ''Fantale'', which was a send up of Swedish sex education films such as  ''[[Language of Love]]''.<ref name=\"ginnane\"/> Franklin:\n<blockquote>With this thin veneer of medical 'therapy', or whatever, these films were being shown in these little underground cinemas and so on around the place. They were all essentially softcore, and we decided to make a kind of send-up of one, really. Not because we wanted to do a send-up, but because we didn't think we wanted to do a genuine one. We just wanted to make a fun film about sex!<ref name=\"trash\">{{cite magazine|url=http://mondostumpo.blogspot.com.au/2007/11/richard-franklin-interview-2002.html |title=Richard Franklin & Eskimo Nell |work=Eros Magazine |volume=3 |number=1 |year=2003 |location=Canberra |accessdate=2014-11-19}}</ref></blockquote>\nGinnane and Franklin had trouble finding actors who would appear in the film in Australia so only the  linking scenes with the professor were shot in that country, with the sex scenes filmed in Los Angeles by Franklin and his cinematographer Vince Monton, using American porn stars.<ref name=\"pike\"/> An old classmate of Franklin's from USC, Doug Knapp, was working in the area of porn and put them in touch with casting agent Bill Margold.\n\nThe US shoot took ten days, the Australian shoot took one day.<ref name=\"stratton\">{{cite book|first=David |last=Stratton |title=The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival |url=https://archive.org/details/lastnewwaveaustr0000stra |url-access=registration |publisher=Angus & Robertson |year=1980 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lastnewwaveaustr0000stra/page/250 250]}}</ref> Franklin says that John Bluthal, who played the professor, ad-libbed some of his dialogue, and that the porn actors were paid around $200 a day, except for John Holmes who was paid around $400 a day.<ref name=\"trash\"/> Franklin:\n<blockquote>That was an era where hardcore was NOT being produced in L.A. In fact, as I recall, we had the police call in on more than one occasion while we were shooting, just to make sure we weren't doing hardcore. But I was told, and I guess it would be evident if you studied the films of the era, but virtually all of the actors did hardcore work, but they did that in San Francisco or in Europe. But it was just a short period when hardcore porn was not\u2026 There was no problem shooting what they call T and A, tits and arse, but you weren't allowed to have people fucking on the set.<ref name=\"trash\"/></blockquote>\nDespite the presence of American actors, Franklin says it was always his intention that the film be made primarily for the Australian market.<ref name=\"trash\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough the movie was entirely soft core, around 45 seconds were cut out by the Australian censor prior to release.

He attempted to set up a [[Roger Corman]] type \"nurses\" film which he would produce and direct budgeted at $250,000 and then a crime drama set against the background of the massage parlour business called ''Sexy Little Me'' budgeted at $150,000, but was unable to find the money. However he could raise $50,000 and allocated directing duties to Richard Franklin, with whom Ginnane had worked with on the overseas marketing for ''[[The True Story of Eskimo Nell]]''.<ref name=\"ginnane\"/>\n\nFranklin and Ginnane wanted to make something commercial so their options were a bikie, horror or sex film. They decided to make a sex film with Franklin pushing to make it more of a comedy. [[Ross Dimsey]] wrote a script, originally called ''Fantale'', which was a send up of Swedish sex education films such as  ''[[Language of Love]]''.<ref name=\"ginnane\"/> Franklin:\n<blockquote>With this thin veneer of medical 'therapy', or whatever, these films were being shown in these little underground cinemas and so on around the place. They were all essentially softcore, and we decided to make a kind of send-up of one, really. Not because we wanted to do a send-up, but because we didn't think we wanted to do a genuine one.

Sulfur dioxide for this purpose is made when sulfur combines with oxygen. The method of converting sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid is called the [[contact process]]. Several billion kilograms are produced annually for this purpose.\n\n===As a preservative===\nSulfur dioxide is sometimes used as a [[preservative]] for dried [[apricot]]s, dried [[common fig|figs]], and other [[dried fruit]]s, owing to its [[antimicrobial]] properties, and is called [[E number|E]]220<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist#h_3 Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers], The Food Standards Agency website.</ref> when used in this way in Europe.

Wines containing sulfur dioxide are typically labeled with \"containing [[sulfite]]s\".\n\nSulfur dioxide exists in wine in free and bound forms, and the combinations are referred to as total SO<sub>2</sub>. Binding, for instance to the carbonyl group of [[acetaldehyde]], varies with the wine in question. The free form exists in equilibrium between molecular SO<sub>2</sub> (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion, which is in turn in equilibrium with sulfite ion. These equilibria depend on the pH of the wine. Lower pH shifts the equilibrium towards molecular (gaseous) SO<sub>2</sub>, which is the active form, while at higher pH more SO<sub>2</sub> is found in the inactive sulfite and bisulfite forms. The molecular SO<sub>2</sub> is active as an antimicrobial and antioxidant, and this is also the form which may be perceived as a pungent odor at high levels. Wines with total SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations below 10 ppm do not require \"contains sulfites\" on the label by US and EU laws.  The upper limit of total SO<sub>2</sub> allowed in wine in the US is 350 ppm; in the EU it is 160 ppm for red wines and 210 ppm for white and ros\u00e9 wines. In low concentrations, SO<sub>2</sub> is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over 50 ppm, SO<sub>2</sub> becomes evident in the smell and taste of wine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nSO<sub>2</sub> is also a very important compound in winery sanitation.  Wineries and equipment must be kept clean, and because bleach cannot be used in a winery due the risk of [[cork taint]],<ref>[http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FS/FS-50-W.pdf Chlorine Use in the Winery]. Purdue University</ref> a mixture of SO<sub>2</sub>, water, and citric acid is commonly used to clean and sanitize equipment. [[Ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>) is now used extensively for sanitizing in wineries due to its efficacy, and because it does not affect the wine or most equipment.<ref>[https://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb00/ozone.htm Use of ozone for winery and environmental sanitation], Practical Winery & Vineyard Journal.</ref>\n\n===As a reducing agent===\nSulfur dioxide is also a good [[Reducing agent|reductant]]. In the presence of water, sulfur dioxide is able to decolorize substances.  Specifically, it is a useful reducing [[bleach]] for [[paper]]s and delicate materials such as clothes.  This bleaching effect normally does not last very long. [[Oxygen]] in the atmosphere reoxidizes the reduced dyes, restoring the color.  In municipal wastewater treatment, sulfur dioxide is used to treat chlorinated wastewater prior to release.  Sulfur dioxide reduces free and combined chlorine to [[chloride]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tchobanoglous |first=George |title=Wastewater Engineering |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=1979 |isbn=0-07-041677-X }}</ref>\n\nSulfur dioxide is fairly soluble in water, and by both IR and Raman spectroscopy; the hypothetical sulfurous acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, is not present to any extent.  However, such solutions do show spectra of the hydrogen sulfite ion, HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, by reaction with water, and it is in fact the actual reducing agent present:\n:SO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O \u21cc HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>\n\n===Biochemical and biomedical roles===\nSulfur dioxide is toxic in large amounts.

The \"smoke\" that exits the gas washing bottle is, in fact, a sulfuric acid fog generated in a reaction.]]\n\n===Combustion routes===\nSulfur dioxide is the product of the burning of [[sulfur]] or of burning materials that contain sulfur:\n\n: S + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 SO<sub>2</sub>, \u0394H = \u2212297 kJ/mol\n\nTo aid combustion, liquefied sulfur (140\u2013150&nbsp;\u00b0C, 284-302&nbsp;\u00b0F) is sprayed through an atomizing nozzle to generate fine drops of sulfur with a large surface area. The reaction is [[exothermic]], and the combustion produces temperatures of 1000\u20131600&nbsp;\u00b0C (1832\u20132912&nbsp;\u00b0F). The significant amount of heat produced is recovered by steam generation that can subsequently be converted to electricity.<ref name = Ullmann/>\n\nThe combustion of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and organosulfur compounds proceeds similarly.

These events can release millions of tonnes of SO<sub>2</sub>.\n\n===Reduction of higher oxides===\nSulfur dioxide can also be a byproduct in the manufacture of [[calcium silicate]] [[cement]]; [[Calcium sulfate|CaSO<sub>4</sub>]] is heated with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] and sand in this process:\n\n: 2 CaSO<sub>4</sub> + 2 SiO<sub>2</sub> + C \u2192 2 CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + 2 SO<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nUntil the 1970s, commercial quantities of sulfuric acid and cement were produced by this process in [[Whitehaven]], England. Upon being mixed with [[shale]] or [[marl]], and roasted, the sulfate liberated sulfur dioxide gas, used in sulfuric acid production, the reaction also produced calcium silicate, a precursor in cement production.<ref>[http://www.lakestay.co.uk/whitehavenmininghistory.html WHITEHAVEN COAST ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY]. lakestay.co.uk (2007)</ref>\n\nOn a laboratory scale, the action of hot concentrated sulfuric acid on copper [[swarf|turnings]] produces sulfur dioxide.\n\n: Cu  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 CuSO<sub>4</sub>  +  SO<sub>2</sub>  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n===From sulfite===\nSulfite results from the reaction of aqueous base and sulfur dioxide.  The reverse reaction involves acidification of [[sodium metabisulfite]]:\n\n: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>  +  Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>  \u2192  2 SO<sub>2</sub>  +  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>  + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n==Reactions==\n\n===Industrial reactions===\nTreatment of basic solutions with sulfur dioxide affords sulfite salts (e.g. [[sodium sulfite]]):\n\n: SO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH \u2192 Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nFeaturing sulfur in the +4 oxidation state, sulfur dioxide is a [[reducing agent]].  It is oxidized by halogens to give the sulfuryl halides, such as [[sulfuryl chloride]]:\n\n: SO<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> \u2192 SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>\n\nSulfur dioxide is the [[oxidising agent]] in the [[Claus process]], which is conducted on a large scale in [[oil refineries]].  Here, sulfur dioxide is reduced by hydrogen sulfide to give elemental sulfur:\n\n: SO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>S \u2192 3 S + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThe sequential oxidation of sulfur dioxide followed by its hydration is used in the production of sulfuric acid.\n\n: 2 SO<sub>2</sub>  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>O  +  O<sub>2</sub>   \u2192   2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>\n\n===Laboratory reactions===\nSulfur dioxide is one of the few common acidic yet reducing gases. It turns moist litmus pink (being acidic), then white (due to its bleaching effect). It may be identified by bubbling it through a [[dichromate]] solution, turning the solution from orange to green (Cr<sup>3+</sup> (aq)). It can also reduce ferric ions to ferrous.<ref name=Lucas >http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2017/rncan-nrcan/M34-20/M34-20-107-eng.pdf</ref>\n\nSulfur dioxide can react with certain 1,3-[[diene]]s in a [[cheletropic reaction]] to form cyclic [[sulfone]]s. This reaction is exploited on an industrial scale for the synthesis of [[sulfolane]], which is an important solvent in the [[petrochemical industry]].\n\n: [[File:Cheletropic reaction of butadiene with SO2.svg|frameless|upright=0.7]]\n\nSulfur dioxide can bind to metal ions as a [[ligand]] to form [[metal sulfur dioxide complex]]es, typically where the transition metal is in oxidation state 0 or +1.  Many different bonding modes (geometries) are recognized, but in most cases, the ligand is monodentate, attached to the metal through sulfur, which can be either planar and pyramidal [[hapticity|\u03b7]]<sup>1</sup>.<ref name=Greenwood>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Precursor to sulfuric acid===\nSulfur dioxide is an intermediate in the production of sulfuric acid, being converted to [[sulfur trioxide]], and then to [[oleum]], which is made into sulfuric acid. Sulfur dioxide for this purpose is made when sulfur combines with oxygen. The method of converting sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid is called the [[contact process]]. Several billion kilograms are produced annually for this purpose.\n\n===As a preservative===\nSulfur dioxide is sometimes used as a [[preservative]] for dried [[apricot]]s, dried [[common fig|figs]], and other [[dried fruit]]s, owing to its [[antimicrobial]] properties, and is called [[E number|E]]220<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist#h_3 Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers], The Food Standards Agency website.</ref> when used in this way in Europe.  As a preservative, it maintains the colorful appearance of the fruit and prevents [[Decomposition|rotting]]. It is also added to sulfured [[molasses]].\n\n===In winemaking===\nSulfur dioxide was first used in [[winemaking]] by the Romans, when they discovered that burning sulfur candles inside empty wine vessels keeps them fresh and free from vinegar smell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb09/page1.htm|publisher=www.practicalwinery.com|date=1 Feb 2009|title=Practical Winery & vineyard Journal Jan/Feb 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928111625/http://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb09/page1.htm|archive-date=2013-09-28|df=}}</ref>\n\nIt is still an important compound in winemaking, and is measured in [[parts per million]] (''ppm'') in wine.

Wines containing sulfur dioxide are typically labeled with \"containing [[sulfite]]s\".\n\nSulfur dioxide exists in wine in free and bound forms, and the combinations are referred to as total SO<sub>2</sub>. Binding, for instance to the carbonyl group of [[acetaldehyde]], varies with the wine in question. The free form exists in equilibrium between molecular SO<sub>2</sub> (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion, which is in turn in equilibrium with sulfite ion. These equilibria depend on the pH of the wine. Lower pH shifts the equilibrium towards molecular (gaseous) SO<sub>2</sub>, which is the active form, while at higher pH more SO<sub>2</sub> is found in the inactive sulfite and bisulfite forms. The molecular SO<sub>2</sub> is active as an antimicrobial and antioxidant, and this is also the form which may be perceived as a pungent odor at high levels. Wines with total SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations below 10 ppm do not require \"contains sulfites\" on the label by US and EU laws.  The upper limit of total SO<sub>2</sub> allowed in wine in the US is 350 ppm; in the EU it is 160 ppm for red wines and 210 ppm for white and ros\u00e9 wines. In low concentrations, SO<sub>2</sub> is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over 50 ppm, SO<sub>2</sub> becomes evident in the smell and taste of wine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nSO<sub>2</sub> is also a very important compound in winery sanitation.  Wineries and equipment must be kept clean, and because bleach cannot be used in a winery due the risk of [[cork taint]],<ref>[http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FS/FS-50-W.pdf Chlorine Use in the Winery]. Purdue University</ref> a mixture of SO<sub>2</sub>, water, and citric acid is commonly used to clean and sanitize equipment. [[Ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>) is now used extensively for sanitizing in wineries due to its efficacy, and because it does not affect the wine or most equipment.<ref>[https://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb00/ozone.htm Use of ozone for winery and environmental sanitation], Practical Winery & Vineyard Journal.</ref>\n\n===As a reducing agent===\nSulfur dioxide is also a good [[Reducing agent|reductant]]. In the presence of water, sulfur dioxide is able to decolorize substances.  Specifically, it is a useful reducing [[bleach]] for [[paper]]s and delicate materials such as clothes.  This bleaching effect normally does not last very long. [[Oxygen]] in the atmosphere reoxidizes the reduced dyes, restoring the color.  In municipal wastewater treatment, sulfur dioxide is used to treat chlorinated wastewater prior to release.  Sulfur dioxide reduces free and combined chlorine to [[chloride]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tchobanoglous |first=George |title=Wastewater Engineering |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=1979 |isbn=0-07-041677-X }}</ref>\n\nSulfur dioxide is fairly soluble in water, and by both IR and Raman spectroscopy; the hypothetical sulfurous acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, is not present to any extent.  However, such solutions do show spectra of the hydrogen sulfite ion, HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, by reaction with water, and it is in fact the actual reducing agent present:\n:SO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O \u21cc HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>\n\n===Biochemical and biomedical roles===\nSulfur dioxide is toxic in large amounts.  It or its conjugate base bisulfite is produced biologically as an intermediate in both sulfate-reducing organisms and in sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, as well.
