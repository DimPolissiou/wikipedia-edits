The Academy stated: \"For most categories, we would prefer streaming distribution links for online entry submissions, though CD submissions remain optional\". As justification for this development, the Academy highlighted the changing music industry and added that submitting links was more convenient and cost effective, especially for smaller and independent labels.\n* Additionally, there were separate screening committees for Pop and Rock, whereas previously these categories were screened by a Core Committee. This leaves the Core Committee to focus on the more difficult decisions such as determining who is eligible for the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category and trying to find the best home for borderline genre entries.\n* The definition of the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]] had been expanded to accept \"contemporary pop songs performed in traditional pop style \u2013 the term \"traditional\" being a reference to the style of the composition, vocal styling and the instrumental arrangement without regard to the age of the material\". The Academy stated that broadening the category was done in an attempt to allow it to \"remain robust and inclusive\" and enable it to be more competitive as, for example, [[Tony Bennett]] has won the award 13 times.\n* Spoken word recordings targeted at children had been moved from the [[Grammy Award for Best Children's Album|Best Children's Album]] category to the [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album|Best Spoken Word Album]].\n* As of the 62nd Grammy Awards, Spanish-language Latin Gospel and Christian music would be officially welcomed in the [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album|Best Gospel Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album|Best Contemporary Christian Music Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Roots Gospel Album|Best Roots Gospel Album]], [[Grammy

The Academy stated: \"For most categories, we would prefer streaming distribution links for online entry submissions, though CD submissions remain optional\". As justification for this development, the Academy highlighted the changing music industry and added that submitting links was more convenient and cost effective, especially for smaller and independent labels.\n* Additionally, there were separate screening committees for Pop and Rock, whereas previously these categories were screened by a Core Committee. This leaves the Core Committee to focus on the more difficult decisions such as determining who is eligible for the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category and trying to find the best home for borderline genre entries.\n* The definition of the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]] had been expanded to accept \"contemporary pop songs performed in traditional pop style \u2013 the term \"traditional\" being a reference to the style of the composition, vocal styling and the instrumental arrangement without regard to the age of the material\". The Academy stated that broadening the category was done in an attempt to allow it to \"remain robust and inclusive\" and enable it to be more competitive as, for example, [[Tony Bennett]] has won the award 13 times.\n* Spoken word recordings targeted at children had been moved from the [[Grammy Award for Best Children's Album|Best Children's Album]] category to the [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album|Best Spoken Word Album]].\n* As of the 62nd Grammy Awards, Spanish-language Latin Gospel and Christian music would be officially welcomed in the [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album|Best Gospel Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album|Best Contemporary Christian Music Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Roots Gospel Album|Best Roots Gospel Album]], [[Grammy

During the 1820s and 1830s the area was designated as part of the Choctaw Nation in the southern Indian Territory. During the [[Indian removal]]s the Choctaws followed the [[Choctaw Trail of Tears]] from their ancestral homeland in [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] into this area. The Choctaw Nation originally extended from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border in the west (now part of the [[Texas panhandle]]) to the [[Arkansas Territory]] in the east, from the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] in the south to the [[South Canadian River]] in the north. In 1855, the Choctaw and Chickasaws formally divided their land into two separate nations, with Durant remaining in Choctaw territory on the east. Chickasaw land extended west to the boundary that would divide Indian Territory from Oklahoma Territory after passage of the Oklahoma Organic Act in 1890.<ref name=\"milligan\"/>\n\nPierre Durant and his four sons, all of French-Choctaw origin, made the journey up the Trail of Tears on the way to the southeastern part of the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw Nation]] in 1832. The brothers, grown, with families of their own, established homesteads from the Arkansas line to Durant. One son, Fisher, married to a full-blood [[Choctaw]], found a beautiful location for a home between Durant's present Eighth and Ninth avenues.

A minister, businessman and civic leader, Dixon Durant is credited with pastorates in local [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregational]] and [[Methodist]] churches. He established the first store selling general merchandise in 1873,<ref name=\"milligan\">Milligan, Keith L.

A wheelless boxcar was parked on the siding there and named \"Durant Station\". Dixon Durant erected the first building, adjacent to the boxcar, where he  opened a general store in 1873. The first post office, also named as Durant Station, opened February 20, 1879, but closed on July 11, 1881.{{sfn|Shirk|1987|p=74}} A.E.

It reads \"Barrow Gang spotted in Durant, Oklahoma,\" with a sub-headline reading \"Three Businesses Robbed At Gunpoint. Outlaws wanted in multiple states.\" True to the mini-series' inspiration, this was based upon true events.\n* The Small Business Revolution - Durant saw an exciting end to 2018 and subsequent beginning to 2019 with a spot in competition to be the location for filming of Season 4 of The Small Business Revolution, a television show produced by [[Deluxe Corporation]] for distribution on [[Hulu]] and [[YouTube]]. The town applied to be  considered in August 2018. The announcement was made in November that Durant was included as a finalist in a list of Top 20. The following month, Durant made the top 10. In January, the producers, along with host, Amanda Brinkman, visited the community for a welcome rally and to visit with small business owners who had applied to appear on the show, should Durant win the competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusinessrevolution.org/small-business-revolution/blog/2019/02/04/best-top-10-tour-yet/|title=Best Top 10 Tour Yet?|date=2019-02-04|website=Small Business Revolution|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusinessrevolution.org/small-business-revolution/blog/2019/04/29/networking-yields-big-benefits-to-small-businesses/|title=Networking Yields Big Benefits to Small Businesses|date=2019-04-29|website=Small Business Revolution|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref> In a live web announcement on February 12, Brinkman, along with co-host [[Ty Pennington]], announced that there had been a slight change in the competition, with 6 finalists, rather than 5, proceeding to the final weeklong public vote. As a part of the campaign for votes, Durant garnered shout outs from [[Reba McEntire]], [[Blake Shelton]], and [[Barry Switzer]], among others. During the weeklong public vote, the show made three announcements as to where the votes stood, with Durant in first place as of the final update. At the conclusion of voting, with a week to go before the announcement of the winning town, Durant went to work planning for the #MyDurant party, where Brinkman would appear if Durant should win. Ultimately, [[Searcy, Arkansas]] was announced as the winner. The competition gave the city a boost in morale and saw the city work together toward the goal of winning the show. Despite it all, Durant was featured in several blogs published by the production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusinessrevolution.org/small-business-revolution/blog/2019/06/24/bubbas-brewhouse-bringing-music-to-a-small-town/|title=Bubba's Brewhouse: Bringing Music to a Small Town|date=2019-06-24|website=Small Business Revolution|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusinessrevolution.org/small-business-revolution/blog/2019/01/30/cobblestone-outfitters-a-family-affair/|title=Cobblestone Outfitters at the Old Ice House: a Family Affair|date=2019-01-30|website=Small Business Revolution|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref>\n\n== Other distinctions ==\nDurant has had the honor to be recognized on a national scale on various occasions, regarding famous visitations or other attention.

During the 1820s and 1830s the area was designated as part of the Choctaw Nation in the southern Indian Territory. During the [[Indian removal]]s the Choctaws followed the [[Choctaw Trail of Tears]] from their ancestral homeland in [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] into this area. The Choctaw Nation originally extended from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border in the west (now part of the [[Texas panhandle]]) to the [[Arkansas Territory]] in the east, from the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] in the south to the [[South Canadian River]] in the north. In 1855, the Choctaw and Chickasaws formally divided their land into two separate nations, with Durant remaining in Choctaw territory on the east. Chickasaw land extended west to the boundary that would divide Indian Territory from Oklahoma Territory after passage of the Oklahoma Organic Act in 1890.<ref name=\"milligan\"/>\n\nPierre Durant and his four sons, all of French-Choctaw origin, made the journey up the Trail of Tears on the way to the southeastern part of the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw Nation]] in 1832. The brothers, grown, with families of their own, established homesteads from the Arkansas line to Durant. One son, Fisher, married to a full-blood [[Choctaw]], found a beautiful location for a home between Durant's present Eighth and Ninth avenues.  At the time of Durant's founding it was located in [[Blue County, Choctaw Nation|Blue County]] of the Choctaw Nation.\n\nFisher Durant's son Dixon Durant is recognized as the founder of Durant and is honored as its namesake. A minister, businessman and civic leader, Dixon Durant is credited with pastorates in local [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregational]] and [[Methodist]] churches. He established the first store selling general merchandise in 1873,<ref name=\"milligan\">Milligan, Keith L.

A wheelless boxcar was parked on the siding there and named \"Durant Station\". Dixon Durant erected the first building, adjacent to the boxcar, where he  opened a general store in 1873. The first post office, also named as Durant Station, opened February 20, 1879, but closed on July 11, 1881.{{sfn|Shirk|1987|p=74}} A.E.

The St. Louis and San Francisco Railway (also known as \"SL & SF\" or \"Frisco\") had intended to build an east\u2013west line through Caddo, where it would intersect the Katy. However, the land prices near Caddo had increased rapidly, causing the Frisco to bypass Caddo in favor of Durant.<ref name=nrhpdoc>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=07000517}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Durant Downtown Historic District |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author= Kelli E.

During the weeklong public vote, the show made three announcements as to where the votes stood, with Durant in first place as of the final update. At the conclusion of voting, with a week to go before the announcement of the winning town, Durant went to work planning for the #MyDurant party, where Brinkman would appear if Durant should win.

She notes \"I rarely do this, but it is also rare for a woman to be a president of a college where there are both men and women students.\" She also wrote that upon boarding the train to leave town, some of the students waiting at the depot assisted her in loading fifty-four boxes of flowers as gifts to her onto the train.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/myday/displaydoc.cfm?_y=1937&_f=md054596c|title=My Day, March 20, 1937|last=Roosevelt|first= Eleanor|editor-last=Black|editor-first=Allida M.|date=2007-06-04|website=www2.gwu.edu|access-date=2017-04-09|editor-last2=Binker|editor-first2= Mary Jo |editor-last3=Alhambra|editor-first3= Christopher C. }}</ref>\n* In 1953, actor [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] and actress/singer [[Rosemary Clooney]] were married in Durant while Jose was performing in the musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' in [[Dallas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19530714&id=N-8gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xnIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5074,2039063|title=The Day \u2013 Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}</ref>\n* On July 15, 2015, President [[Barack Obama]] visited the city to address the nation from Durant High School on his \"Promised Zone\" initiative.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://durantdemocrat.com/top-stories/480/president-obama-will-address-the-nation-from-durant-high-school-on-wednesday|title=President Obama will address the nation from Durant High School on Wednesday|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051240/http://durantdemocrat.com/top-stories/480/president-obama-will-address-the-nation-from-durant-high-school-on-wednesday|archive-date=2017-04-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2014, the President designated five areas in the United States as Promised Zones, including the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]].

Yes, it is understood that the city Durant was not named after the evil Kevin Durant, but it is just another hideous reminder of what happened,\" the petition read. Neither the creator of the petition, nor Kevin Durant had ever visited the community.

''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' published a light-hearted article regarding the Durant Fire Department's annual Christmas Card. The Department had experienced the birth of six babies during the year and decided to feature them in their annual Christmas card. \"If you ask many of the fire fighters in Durant, OK what defines them; they will say brotherhood and family. That is why when this small paid department of 33 looked back on the year and saw that 6 of their brothers had newborn babies, it was time to show the public what was at the core of their department.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/human-interest/oklahoma-fire-department-creates-cutest-christmas-card-ever-with-squad-of-tiny-firefighters/|title=Oklahoma Fire Department Creates Cutest Christmas Card Ever with Squad of Tiny Firefighters|date=2016-12-22|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==<!-- PLEASE RESPECCT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n{{See also|Southeastern Oklahoma State University#Notable alumni|l1=List of Southeastern Oklahoma State University notable people}} <!-- Please put college students in this list instead of the city article -->\n* [[Brett Butler (baseball)|Brett Butler]], professional baseball player, attended [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University]]\n* [[Mike Christian (politician)|Mike Christian]], state representative, attended [[University of Oklahoma]]\n* [[Joe Dobson]], Major League Baseball pitcher, 1948 American League [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], inducted in [[Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame]]\n* [[Gail Farrell]], cast member of ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]''; Gail Farrell Drive, avenue located on far north side of city, named in her honor in mid-1970s\n* [[Ralph Faudree]], mathematician and provost of the [[University of Memphis]]\n* [[Billie Letts]], author of No. 1 ''New York Times'' bestseller and [[Oprah Winfrey]] Book Club selection ''[[Where the Heart Is (novel)|Where the Heart Is]]'' (Warner, 1996), made into 2000 [[Where the Heart Is (2000 film)|film of the same title]]; although a Tulsa native, she was an English professor at Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant\n* [[Tracy Letts]], playwright and actor, [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] and [[Tony Award]]-winning for ''[[August: Osage County]]'';  the [[August: Osage County (film)|film version]] starred  [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Julia Roberts]]; in 2012\u20132013, Letts appeared on Broadway in 50th Anniversary revival of Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'', as originally presented by the Steppenwolf Theater Company; he received Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play (Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play) for his performance\n* [[Reba McEntire]], recording artist, Grammy Award-winning singer and actress, attended Southeastern Oklahoma State University\n* [[Kirby Minter]], retired basketball player, played for Team USA in [[1954 FIBA World Championship]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] \n* [[Dennis Rodman]], professional basketball player, attended Southeastern Oklahoma State University\n* [[Robert L.
