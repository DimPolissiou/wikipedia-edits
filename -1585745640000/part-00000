It was released on 12 January 1969 in the United States and on 31 March in the United Kingdom by [[Atlantic Records]].\n\nThe album was recorded in September and October 1968 at [[Olympic Studios]], [[London]], shortly after the band's formation. It contains a mix of original material worked out in the first rehearsals, and remakes and rearrangements of contemporary blues and folk songs. The sessions took place before the group had secured a recording contract and took 36 hours; they were paid for directly by [[Jimmy Page]], the group's founder, leader, and guitarist, and Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] and cost \u00a31,782 ({{Inflation|UK|value=1782|start_year=1969|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) to complete.  It was self-produced by Page.\n\nHe was joined on the album by band members [[Robert Plant]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass, keyboards), and [[John Bonham]] (drums).  Percussionist [[Viram Jasani]] appears as a guest on one track.  The album was mixed by Page's childhood friend [[Glyn Johns]], and the iconic album cover showing the [[Hindenburg disaster]] was designed by [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]].\n\nThe album showed the group's fusion of blues and rock, and their take on the emerging [[hard rock]] sound was immediately commercially successful in both the UK and US, reaching the top-10 on album charts in both countries, as well as several others.  Many of the songs were longer and not well suited to be released as singles for radio airplay, and Page was reluctant to release \"singles\", so only one single was released, \"[[Good Times Bad Times]]\". However, due to exposure on [[album-oriented rock]] radio stations, and growth in popularity of the band, many of the album's songs have become [[classic rock]] radio staples.\n\n==Background==\nIn July 1968, the English rock band [[the Yardbirds]] disbanded after two founder members [[Keith Relf]] and [[Jim McCarty]] quit the group, with a third, [[Chris Dreja]], leaving to become a photographer shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=87}} The fourth member, guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], was left with rights to the name and contractual obligations for a series of concerts in [[Scandinavia]]. Page asked seasoned session player and arranger [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] to join as bassist, and hoped to recruit [[Terry Reid]] as singer and [[Procol Harum]]'s [[B. J. Wilson]] as drummer. Wilson was still committed to Procol Harum, and Reid declined to join but recommended [[Robert Plant]], who met with Page at his boathouse in [[Pangbourne]], [[Berkshire]] in August to talk about music and work on new material.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=87}}<ref name=ZEP1>{{cite web|url=https://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/jimmy-page-sheds-new-light-on-the-inception-of-led-zeppelin-i/|title=Jimmy Page sheds new light on the inception of 'Led Zeppelin I'|publisher=Planet Rock|first=Scott|last=Colothan|date=27 September 2018|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nPage and Plant realised they had good musical chemistry together, and Plant asked friend and former band-mate [[John Bonham]] to drum for the new group. The line-up of Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham first rehearsed on August 19, 1968 (the day before Plant's 20th birthday), shortly before a [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|tour of Scandinavia]] as \"The New Yardbirds\", performing some old Yardbirds material as well as new songs such as \"[[Communication Breakdown]]\", \"[[I Can't Quit You Baby]]\", \"[[You Shook Me]]\", \"[[Babe I'm Gonna Leave You]]\" and \"[[How Many More Times]]\".{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=43}} After they returned to London following the tour, Page changed the band's name to [[Led Zeppelin]], and the group entered [[Olympic Studios]] at 11 p.m. on 25 September 1968 to record their debut album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=87}}<ref name=ZEP1/>\n\n== Recording ==\nPage said that the album took only about 36 hours of studio time (over a span of a few weeks) to create (including mixing), adding that he knew this because of the amount charged on the studio bill.{{sfn|Welch|1994|pp=28,37}} One of the primary reasons for the short recording time was that the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on the Scandinavian tour.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}}{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=13}}\n\nThe band had not yet signed a deal and there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. Page and Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] paid for the sessions themselves.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}} The reported total studio costs were \u00a31,782.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=32}} The self-funding was important because it meant they could record exactly what they wanted without record company interference.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=15}}\n\nFor the recordings, Page played a psychedelically painted [[Fender Telecaster]], a gift from friend [[Jeff Beck]] after Page recommended him to join the Yardbirds in 1965, replacing [[Eric Clapton]] on lead guitar.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=118}}<ref name=\"JPinterview\">{{cite journal|first=Steven|last=Rosen|url=http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/003340.html|title=1977 Jimmy Page Interview by \"Modern Guitars\"|date=25 May 2007|orig-year=July 1977, in ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine}}</ref>{{efn|Page used different guitars for recording later albums, particularly a [[Gibson Les Paul]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=118}}}} Page played the Telecaster through a [[Supro]] [[amplifier]], and used a [[Gibson J-200]], for the album's acoustic tracks. For \"[[#Track listing|Your Time Is Gonna Come]]\" he used a Fender 10-string [[pedal steel guitar]].<ref name=\"JPinterview\" />{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}\n\n=== Production ===\n''Led Zeppelin'' was produced by Page and engineered by [[Glyn Johns]], who had known each other since they were teenagers in the suburb of [[Epsom]].<ref name=\"recordmirror\">{{cite news |last=Boyle |first=Jules |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/legendary-producer-glyn-johns-reveals-4849210 |title=Legendary producer Glyn Johns reveals missed opportunity for unique collaboration |accessdate=7 October 2015 |newspaper=Daily Record}}</ref> According to Page, most of the album was recorded live, with overdubs added later.<ref name=\"Uncut09\">{{cite journal|title=I first met Jimmy on Tolworth Broadway, holding a bag of exotic fish|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=January 2009|p=42}}</ref>\n\nPage used a \"distance makes depth\" approach to production. He used natural room ambience to enhance the reverb and recording texture on the record, demonstrating the innovations in sound recording he had learned during his session days. At the time, most music producers placed [[microphone]]s directly in front of the amplifiers and drums.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=15}} For ''Led Zeppelin'', Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as far as {{convert|20|ft|m|0}}) and then recording the balance between the two. Page became one of the first producers to record a band's \"ambient sound\": the distance of a note's time-lag from one end of the room to the other.<ref name=\"LightShade\">{{cite journal|last=Tolinski|first=Brad|last2=Di Bendetto|first2=Greg|date=January 1998|title=Light and Shade|journal=Guitar World}}</ref><ref name=\"RS2006\">{{cite news|last1=Gilmore|first1=Mikal|title=The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin|accessdate=29 November 2017|work=Rolling Stone|date=28 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017054415/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin|archivedate=17 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the live recording, some songs had Plant's vocals [[spill (audio)|bleed]] onto other tracks. Page later stated that this was a natural product of Plant's powerful voice, but added the leakage \"sounds intentional\".<ref name=\"LightShade\" /> On \"You Shook Me\", Page used the \"[[Reverse echo]]\" technique. It involves hearing the echo before the main sound (instead of after it), and is achieved by turning the tape over and recording the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.<ref name=\"LightShade\" />\n\nThis was one of the first albums to be released in stereo only. Prior to this, albums had been released in separate mono and stereo versions.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}}\n\n==Composition==\n{{see_also|List of Led Zeppelin songs written or inspired by others}}\nThe songs on ''Led Zeppelin'' came from the first group rehearsals, which were then refined on the Scandinavian tour. The group were familiar with the material when they entered Olympic to start recording, which was a key reason it was completed quickly. Plant participated in songwriting but was not given credit because of unexpired contractual obligations resulting from his association with [[Sony Music|CBS Records]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}\n\n===Side one===\n\"[[Good Times Bad Times]]\" was a commercial-sounding track that was considered as the group's debut single in the UK, and released as such in the US. As well as showcasing the whole band and their new heavy style, it featured a catchy chorus and a variety of guitar overdubs.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=45\u201346}} Despite being a strong track, it was seldom performed live by Led Zeppelin. One of the few occasions it was played was the [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] in 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=36}}\n\n\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\" was a re-arrangement of a song originally composed by [[Anne Bredon]] in the 1950s. Page had heard the song covered by [[Joan Baez]] on her 1962 album ''[[Joan Baez in Concert]]''. It was one of the first numbers that he worked on with Plant when the two first met at Pangbourne in August 1968. Page played both the Gibson J-200 acoustic and Telecaster on the track. Plant originally sang the song in a heavier style, similar to other performances on the album, but was persuaded by Page to re-record it to allow some light and shade on the track.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=27}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=36}}\n\n\"You Shook Me\" was a [[Willie Dixon]] blues song, and fitted in with the British blues boom that was ongoing when the album was being recorded. Jones, Plant and Page took solos on [[Hammond organ]], [[harmonica]] and guitar respectively. Page put backwards echo on the track, which was then a novel production device, on the [[call and response]] between the vocal and guitar towards the end. The song had been covered by [[Jeff Beck]] on the album ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'' and Beck subsequently said he was unhappy about Led Zeppelin copying his arrangement.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}\n\n\"[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]\" was written and recorded by [[Jake Holmes]] in 1967. The original album credited Page as the sole composer; Holmes sued for copyright infringement in 2010 and an out-of-court settlement was made the following year. The Yardbirds covered the song regularly in concert during 1968, and performed it for several radio and television sessions. Their arrangement included a section where Page played the guitar with a [[violin bow]], an idea suggested by [[David McCallum Sr.]] whom Page had met while doing sessions. The guitar solo was derived from one Page had used on the Yardbirds' \"Think About It\". Led Zeppelin's recording of the track used different lyrics, while Jones and Bonham developed the arrangement to accommodate their playing styles.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThe song was an important part of Led Zeppelin's live show throughout their early career, and became a vehicle for group improvisation, eventually stretching in length to over 30 minutes. The improvisation would sometimes include parts of another song, including the group's \"The Crunge\" and \"Walter's Walk\" (released later on ''Houses Of The Holy'' and ''Coda'', respectively), [[Joni Mitchell]]'s \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" and [[Scott McKenzie]]'s \"[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]\". It was briefly dropped from the live set in 1975 after Page injured a finger, but was re-instated for the remainder of the tour. The last full live performance during Led Zeppelin's main career was at [[Earl's Court]], London later that year, after which the violin bow section of the song's guitar solo was played as a standalone piece. It was revived as a complete song performance for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=41\u201342}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\" opens with Jones playing an unaccompanied organ solo, leading into the verse. Page plays acoustic and pedal steel guitar. The track has a [[Fade (audio engineering)#Crossfading|crossfade]] into \"Black Mountain Side\", an acoustic instrumental based on [[Bert Jansch]]'s arrangement of the traditional folk song \"[[Down by Blackwaterside|Black Water Side]]\" and influenced by the folk playing of Jansch and [[John Renbourn]]. The song was regularly performed live as a medley with the Yardbirds solo guitar number \"White Summer\".{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}\n\n\"Communication Breakdown\" was built around a Page guitar riff, and one of the first things the group worked on. They enjoyed playing it live, and consequently it was a regular part of their set. It was played intermittently throughout the group's career, often as an encore.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=46\u201347}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=45}}\n\n\"I Can't Quit You Baby\" was another Willie Dixon cover. It was recorded live in the studio, and arranged in a slower and more laid-back style compared to some of the other material on the album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}\n\n\"How Many More Times\" was the group's closing live number in their early career. The song was improvised around an old [[Howlin' Wolf]] number, \"[[How Many More Years]]\", and a Page guitar riff, which developed spontaneously into a [[jam session]]. The track includes a [[bolero]] section similar to Jeff Beck's \"[[Beck's Bolero]]\" (which was written by and featured Page) and segues into \"Rosie\" and \"[[The Hunter (Albert King song)|The Hunter]]\" which were improvised during recording. Page played the guitar with the violin bow in the middle section of the track, similar to \"Dazed and Confused\".{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=47}}\n\n===Unreleased material===\nTwo other songs from the Olympic sessions, \"[[Baby Come On Home]]\" and \"[[Sugar Mama (song)#Led Zeppelin song|Sugar Mama]]\", were left off the album. They were released on the 2015 reissue of the retrospective album ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/coda-reissue-192526/|title=Coda (reissue)|journal=Rolling Stone|date=31 July 2015|access-date=29 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Artwork==\n[[File:Hindenburg disaster.jpg|thumb|The image of the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' airship  [[Hindenburg disaster|seconds after catching fire]] in 1937 was used as the ''Led Zeppelin'' album cover.]]\n''Led Zeppelin''{{'}}s front cover, which was chosen by Page, features a black-and-white image of the burning ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' airship, photographed by Sam Shere in May 1937.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=33}} The image refers to the origin of the band's name itself: When Page, Beck and The Who's [[Keith Moon]] and [[John Entwistle]] were discussing the idea of forming a group, Moon joked, \"It would probably go over like a lead balloon\", and Entwistle reportedly replied, \"a lead zeppelin!\"<ref name=\"RS2006\"/>\n\nThe back cover features a photograph of the band taken by Dreja. The entire design of the album's sleeve was coordinated by [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]], with whom the band would continue to collaborate for future sleeves.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}} Hardie himself also created the front cover illustration, rendering the famous original black-and-white photograph in ink using a [[Rapidograph]] technical pen and a [[mezzotint]] technique.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=33}}\n\nHardie recalled that he originally offered the band a design based on an old club sign in San Francisco \u2013 a multi-sequential image of a zeppelin airship up in the clouds. Page declined but it was retained as the logo for the back cover of Led Zeppelin's first two albums and a number of early press advertisements.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=33}} The first UK pressing featured the band name and the Atlantic logo in turquoise. When it was switched to the orange print later that year, the turquoise-printed sleeve became a collector's item.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}}\n\nThe album cover gained further widespread attention when, at a February 1970 gig in Copenhagen, the band were billed as \"The Nobs\" as the result of a legal threat from aristocrat Eva von Zeppelin (a relative of the creator of the [[Zeppelin]] aircraft). Von Zeppelin, upon seeing the logo of the ''Hindenburg'' crashing in flames, threatened legal action over the concert taking place.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}}<ref name=\"Billboard Magazine\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bookshelf/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001958757|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009071749/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bookshelf/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001958757|first=Keith|last=Shadwick|title=Led Zeppelin 1968\u20131980: The Story of a Band and Their Music|journal=Billboard|archivedate=9 October 2006}}</ref> In 2001, [[Greg Kot]] wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' that \"The cover of ''Led Zeppelin'' \u2026 shows the ''Hindenburg'' airship, in all its phallic glory, going down in flames.

In Britain the album received a glowing review in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. [[Chris Welch]] wrote, in a review titled \"Jimmy Page triumphs \u2013 Led Zeppelin is a gas!\": \"their material does not rely on obvious blues riffs, although when they do play them, they avoid the emaciated feebleness of most so-called British blues bands\".{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=37}} In ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'', [[Felix Dennis]] regarded it as one of those rare albums that \"defies immediate classification or description, simply because it's so obviously a turning point in rock music that only time proves capable of shifting it into eventual perspective\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=9592 |title=Oz Review |publisher=Rocksbackpages.com |accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref> In comparing the record to their follow-up ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] wrote in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' that the debut was \"subtler and more ambitious musically\", and not as good, \"because subtlety defeated the effect.

It was released on 12 January 1969 in the United States and on 31 March in the United Kingdom by [[Atlantic Records]].\n\nThe album was recorded in September and October 1968 at [[Olympic Studios]], [[London]], shortly after the band's formation. It contains a mix of original material worked out in the first rehearsals, and remakes and rearrangements of contemporary blues and folk songs. The sessions took place before the group had secured a recording contract and took 36 hours; they were paid for directly by [[Jimmy Page]], the group's founder, leader, and guitarist, and Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] and cost \u00a31,782 ({{Inflation|UK|value=1782|start_year=1969|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) to complete.  It was self-produced by Page.\n\nHe was joined on the album by band members [[Robert Plant]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass, keyboards), and [[John Bonham]] (drums).  Percussionist [[Viram Jasani]] appears as a guest on one track.  The album was mixed by Page's childhood friend [[Glyn Johns]], and the iconic album cover showing the [[Hindenburg disaster]] was designed by [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]].\n\nThe album showed the group's fusion of blues and rock, and their take on the emerging [[hard rock]] sound was immediately commercially successful in both the UK and US, reaching the top-10 on album charts in both countries, as well as several others.  Many of the songs were longer and not well suited to be released as singles for radio airplay, and Page was reluctant to release \"singles\", so only one single was released, \"[[Good Times Bad Times]]\". However, due to exposure on [[album-oriented rock]] radio stations, and growth in popularity of the band, many of the album's songs have become [[classic rock]] radio staples.\n\n==Background==\nIn July 1968, the English rock band [[the Yardbirds]] disbanded after two founder members [[Keith Relf]] and [[Jim McCarty]] quit the group, with a third, [[Chris Dreja]], leaving to become a photographer shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=87}} The fourth member, guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], was left with rights to the name and contractual obligations for a series of concerts in [[Scandinavia]]. Page asked seasoned session player and arranger [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] to join as bassist, and hoped to recruit [[Terry Reid]] as singer and [[Procol Harum]]'s [[B. J. Wilson]] as drummer. Wilson was still committed to Procol Harum, and Reid declined to join but recommended [[Robert Plant]], who met with Page at his boathouse in [[Pangbourne]], [[Berkshire]] in August to talk about music and work on new material.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=87}}<ref name=ZEP1>{{cite web|url=https://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/jimmy-page-sheds-new-light-on-the-inception-of-led-zeppelin-i/|title=Jimmy Page sheds new light on the inception of 'Led Zeppelin I'|publisher=Planet Rock|first=Scott|last=Colothan|date=27 September 2018|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nPage and Plant realised they had good musical chemistry together, and Plant asked friend and former band-mate [[John Bonham]] to drum for the new group. The line-up of Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham first rehearsed on August 19, 1968 (the day before Plant's 20th birthday), shortly before a [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|tour of Scandinavia]] as \"The New Yardbirds\", performing some old Yardbirds material as well as new songs such as \"[[Communication Breakdown]]\", \"[[I Can't Quit You Baby]]\", \"[[You Shook Me]]\", \"[[Babe I'm Gonna Leave You]]\" and \"[[How Many More Times]]\".{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=43}} After they returned to London following the tour, Page changed the band's name to [[Led Zeppelin]], and the group entered [[Olympic Studios]] at 11 p.m. on 25 September 1968 to record their debut album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=87}}<ref name=ZEP1/>\n\n== Recording ==\nPage said that the album took only about 36 hours of studio time (over a span of a few weeks) to create (including mixing), adding that he knew this because of the amount charged on the studio bill.{{sfn|Welch|1994|pp=28,37}} One of the primary reasons for the short recording time was that the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on the Scandinavian tour.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}}{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=13}}\n\nThe band had not yet signed a deal and there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. Page and Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] paid for the sessions themselves.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}} The reported total studio costs were \u00a31,782.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=32}} The self-funding was important because it meant they could record exactly what they wanted without record company interference.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=15}}\n\nFor the recordings, Page played a psychedelically painted [[Fender Telecaster]], a gift from friend [[Jeff Beck]] after Page recommended him to join the Yardbirds in 1965, replacing [[Eric Clapton]] on lead guitar.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=118}}<ref name=\"JPinterview\">{{cite journal|first=Steven|last=Rosen|url=http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/003340.html|title=1977 Jimmy Page Interview by \"Modern Guitars\"|date=25 May 2007|orig-year=July 1977, in ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine}}</ref>{{efn|Page used different guitars for recording later albums, particularly a [[Gibson Les Paul]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=118}}}} Page played the Telecaster through a [[Supro]] [[amplifier]], and used a [[Gibson J-200]], for the album's acoustic tracks. For \"[[#Track listing|Your Time Is Gonna Come]]\" he used a Fender 10-string [[pedal steel guitar]].<ref name=\"JPinterview\" />{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}\n\n=== Production ===\n''Led Zeppelin'' was produced by Page and engineered by [[Glyn Johns]], who had known each other since they were teenagers in the suburb of [[Epsom]].<ref name=\"recordmirror\">{{cite news |last=Boyle |first=Jules |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/legendary-producer-glyn-johns-reveals-4849210 |title=Legendary producer Glyn Johns reveals missed opportunity for unique collaboration |accessdate=7 October 2015 |newspaper=Daily Record}}</ref> According to Page, most of the album was recorded live, with overdubs added later.<ref name=\"Uncut09\">{{cite journal|title=I first met Jimmy on Tolworth Broadway, holding a bag of exotic fish|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=January 2009|p=42}}</ref>\n\nPage used a \"distance makes depth\" approach to production. He used natural room ambience to enhance the reverb and recording texture on the record, demonstrating the innovations in sound recording he had learned during his session days. At the time, most music producers placed [[microphone]]s directly in front of the amplifiers and drums.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=15}} For ''Led Zeppelin'', Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as far as {{convert|20|ft|m|0}}) and then recording the balance between the two. Page became one of the first producers to record a band's \"ambient sound\": the distance of a note's time-lag from one end of the room to the other.<ref name=\"LightShade\">{{cite journal|last=Tolinski|first=Brad|last2=Di Bendetto|first2=Greg|date=January 1998|title=Light and Shade|journal=Guitar World}}</ref><ref name=\"RS2006\">{{cite news|last1=Gilmore|first1=Mikal|title=The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin|accessdate=29 November 2017|work=Rolling Stone|date=28 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017054415/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin|archivedate=17 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the live recording, some songs had Plant's vocals [[spill (audio)|bleed]] onto other tracks. Page later stated that this was a natural product of Plant's powerful voice, but added the leakage \"sounds intentional\".<ref name=\"LightShade\" /> On \"You Shook Me\", Page used the \"[[Reverse echo]]\" technique. It involves hearing the echo before the main sound (instead of after it), and is achieved by turning the tape over and recording the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.<ref name=\"LightShade\" />\n\nThis was one of the first albums to be released in stereo only. Prior to this, albums had been released in separate mono and stereo versions.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}}\n\n==Composition==\n{{see_also|List of Led Zeppelin songs written or inspired by others}}\nThe songs on ''Led Zeppelin'' came from the first group rehearsals, which were then refined on the Scandinavian tour. The group were familiar with the material when they entered Olympic to start recording, which was a key reason it was completed quickly. Plant participated in songwriting but was not given credit because of unexpired contractual obligations resulting from his association with [[Sony Music|CBS Records]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}\n\n===Side one===\n\"[[Good Times Bad Times]]\" was a commercial-sounding track that was considered as the group's debut single in the UK, and released as such in the US. As well as showcasing the whole band and their new heavy style, it featured a catchy chorus and a variety of guitar overdubs.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=45\u201346}} Despite being a strong track, it was seldom performed live by Led Zeppelin. One of the few occasions it was played was the [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] in 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=36}}\n\n\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\" was a re-arrangement of a song originally composed by [[Anne Bredon]] in the 1950s. Page had heard the song covered by [[Joan Baez]] on her 1962 album ''[[Joan Baez in Concert]]''. It was one of the first numbers that he worked on with Plant when the two first met at Pangbourne in August 1968. Page played both the Gibson J-200 acoustic and Telecaster on the track. Plant originally sang the song in a heavier style, similar to other performances on the album, but was persuaded by Page to re-record it to allow some light and shade on the track.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=27}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=36}}\n\n\"You Shook Me\" was a [[Willie Dixon]] blues song, and fitted in with the British blues boom that was ongoing when the album was being recorded. Jones, Plant and Page took solos on [[Hammond organ]], [[harmonica]] and guitar respectively. Page put backwards echo on the track, which was then a novel production device, on the [[call and response]] between the vocal and guitar towards the end. The song had been covered by [[Jeff Beck]] on the album ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'' and Beck subsequently said he was unhappy about Led Zeppelin copying his arrangement.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}\n\n\"[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]\" was written and recorded by [[Jake Holmes]] in 1967. The original album credited Page as the sole composer; Holmes sued for copyright infringement in 2010 and an out-of-court settlement was made the following year. The Yardbirds covered the song regularly in concert during 1968, and performed it for several radio and television sessions. Their arrangement included a section where Page played the guitar with a [[violin bow]], an idea suggested by [[David McCallum Sr.]] whom Page had met while doing sessions. The guitar solo was derived from one Page had used on the Yardbirds' \"Think About It\". Led Zeppelin's recording of the track used different lyrics, while Jones and Bonham developed the arrangement to accommodate their playing styles.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThe song was an important part of Led Zeppelin's live show throughout their early career, and became a vehicle for group improvisation, eventually stretching in length to over 30 minutes. The improvisation would sometimes include parts of another song, including the group's \"The Crunge\" and \"Walter's Walk\" (released later on ''Houses Of The Holy'' and ''Coda'', respectively), [[Joni Mitchell]]'s \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" and [[Scott McKenzie]]'s \"[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]\". It was briefly dropped from the live set in 1975 after Page injured a finger, but was re-instated for the remainder of the tour. The last full live performance during Led Zeppelin's main career was at [[Earl's Court]], London later that year, after which the violin bow section of the song's guitar solo was played as a standalone piece. It was revived as a complete song performance for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=41\u201342}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\" opens with Jones playing an unaccompanied organ solo, leading into the verse. Page plays acoustic and pedal steel guitar. The track has a [[Fade (audio engineering)#Crossfading|crossfade]] into \"Black Mountain Side\", an acoustic instrumental based on [[Bert Jansch]]'s arrangement of the traditional folk song \"[[Down by Blackwaterside|Black Water Side]]\" and influenced by the folk playing of Jansch and [[John Renbourn]]. The song was regularly performed live as a medley with the Yardbirds solo guitar number \"White Summer\".{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=46}}\n\n\"Communication Breakdown\" was built around a Page guitar riff, and one of the first things the group worked on. They enjoyed playing it live, and consequently it was a regular part of their set. It was played intermittently throughout the group's career, often as an encore.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=46\u201347}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=45}}\n\n\"I Can't Quit You Baby\" was another Willie Dixon cover. It was recorded live in the studio, and arranged in a slower and more laid-back style compared to some of the other material on the album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}\n\n\"How Many More Times\" was the group's closing live number in their early career. The song was improvised around an old [[Howlin' Wolf]] number, \"[[How Many More Years]]\", and a Page guitar riff, which developed spontaneously into a [[jam session]]. The track includes a [[bolero]] section similar to Jeff Beck's \"[[Beck's Bolero]]\" (which was written by and featured Page) and segues into \"Rosie\" and \"[[The Hunter (Albert King song)|The Hunter]]\" which were improvised during recording. Page played the guitar with the violin bow in the middle section of the track, similar to \"Dazed and Confused\".{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=47}}\n\n===Unreleased material===\nTwo other songs from the Olympic sessions, \"[[Baby Come On Home]]\" and \"[[Sugar Mama (song)#Led Zeppelin song|Sugar Mama]]\", were left off the album. They were released on the 2015 reissue of the retrospective album ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/coda-reissue-192526/|title=Coda (reissue)|journal=Rolling Stone|date=31 July 2015|access-date=29 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Artwork==\n[[File:Hindenburg disaster.jpg|thumb|The image of the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' airship  [[Hindenburg disaster|seconds after catching fire]] in 1937 was used as the ''Led Zeppelin'' album cover.]]\n''Led Zeppelin''{{'}}s front cover, which was chosen by Page, features a black-and-white image of the burning ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' airship, photographed by Sam Shere in May 1937.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=33}} The image refers to the origin of the band's name itself: When Page, Beck and The Who's [[Keith Moon]] and [[John Entwistle]] were discussing the idea of forming a group, Moon joked, \"It would probably go over like a lead balloon\", and Entwistle reportedly replied, \"a lead zeppelin!\"<ref name=\"RS2006\"/>\n\nThe back cover features a photograph of the band taken by Dreja. The entire design of the album's sleeve was coordinated by [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]], with whom the band would continue to collaborate for future sleeves.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}} Hardie himself also created the front cover illustration, rendering the famous original black-and-white photograph in ink using a [[Rapidograph]] technical pen and a [[mezzotint]] technique.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=33}}\n\nHardie recalled that he originally offered the band a design based on an old club sign in San Francisco \u2013 a multi-sequential image of a zeppelin airship up in the clouds. Page declined but it was retained as the logo for the back cover of Led Zeppelin's first two albums and a number of early press advertisements.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=33}} The first UK pressing featured the band name and the Atlantic logo in turquoise. When it was switched to the orange print later that year, the turquoise-printed sleeve became a collector's item.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}}\n\nThe album cover gained further widespread attention when, at a February 1970 gig in Copenhagen, the band were billed as \"The Nobs\" as the result of a legal threat from aristocrat Eva von Zeppelin (a relative of the creator of the [[Zeppelin]] aircraft). Von Zeppelin, upon seeing the logo of the ''Hindenburg'' crashing in flames, threatened legal action over the concert taking place.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}}<ref name=\"Billboard Magazine\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bookshelf/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001958757|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009071749/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bookshelf/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001958757|first=Keith|last=Shadwick|title=Led Zeppelin 1968\u20131980: The Story of a Band and Their Music|journal=Billboard|archivedate=9 October 2006}}</ref> In 2001, [[Greg Kot]] wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' that \"The cover of ''Led Zeppelin'' \u2026 shows the ''Hindenburg'' airship, in all its phallic glory, going down in flames.

It also called Plant \"as [[fop]]pish as [[Rod Stewart]], but nowhere near so exciting\".<ref name=Mendelsohn>{{cite web |author=John Mendelsohn |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/led-zeppelin-i-19690315 |title=Led Zeppelin I|website=Rolling Stone |date=15 March 1969 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/10-classic-albums-rolling-stone-originally-panned-101316/led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-1969-101461/|title=10 Classic Albums Rolling Stone Originally Panned|journal=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref> Because of the bad press, Led Zeppelin avoided talking to them throughout their career.

The [[mudstone]]s are olive green to moderate yellowish brown in colour and contain thinner light reddish-brown layers. The reddish-brown layers frequently contain [[calcareous]] [[Nodule (geology)|nodules]]. [[Desiccation]] cracks - indicative of seasonal dry periods - and raindrop impressions are sometimes found in the [[mudstone]] layers. [[Argillaceous rocks|Argillaceous]] layers are also common. The [[siltstone]]s are extremely fine-grained, often containing [[ripple marks]] from being deposited in low energy streams, and vary from being dark grey, greenish-grey, and blueish-grey in colour. Thin sheets of [[chert]] occur in the [[mudstone]] and less commonly in the [[siltstone]] layers. The [[sandstone]]s are fine-grained and vary from being greyish olive green to dark yellowish brown. Some [[sandstone]] layers either contain or are capped by pebble-sized [[mudstone]]-[[Clastic rock|clast]] [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]]. These [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] also contain isolated [[fossil]]s in some localities. The [[sandstone]]s are more common and at their thickest towards the upper sections of the [[biozone]]. The rocks of this [[biozone]] were likely deposited in a [[subaerial]] [[River delta|deltaic]] environment which included [[floodplain]]s. The presence of [[calcareous]] [[Nodule (geology)|nodules]] also indicates that the environment was warm with seasonal dry periods.<ref>Rubidge, B. S. (ed.) 1995b.

The [[mudstone]]s are olive green to moderate yellowish brown in colour and contain thinner light reddish-brown layers. The reddish-brown layers frequently contain [[calcareous]] [[Nodule (geology)|nodules]]. [[Desiccation]] cracks - indicative of seasonal dry periods - and raindrop impressions are sometimes found in the [[mudstone]] layers. [[Argillaceous rocks|Argillaceous]] layers are also common. The [[siltstone]]s are extremely fine-grained, often containing [[ripple marks]] from being deposited in low energy streams, and vary from being dark grey, greenish-grey, and blueish-grey in colour. Thin sheets of [[chert]] occur in the [[mudstone]] and less commonly in the [[siltstone]] layers. The [[sandstone]]s are fine-grained and vary from being greyish olive green to dark yellowish brown. Some [[sandstone]] layers either contain or are capped by pebble-sized [[mudstone]]-[[Clastic rock|clast]] [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]]. These [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] also contain isolated [[fossil]]s in some localities. The [[sandstone]]s are more common and at their thickest towards the upper sections of the [[biozone]]. The rocks of this [[biozone]] were likely deposited in a [[subaerial]] [[River delta|deltaic]] environment which included [[floodplain]]s. The presence of [[calcareous]] [[Nodule (geology)|nodules]] also indicates that the environment was warm with seasonal dry periods.<ref>Rubidge, B. S. (ed.) 1995b.

The larvae of the most commonly encountered species are nearly transparent with a non-retractable black head and can sometimes be seen moving along the moist edges of crevices in shower stalls or bathtubs or submerged in toilet water.  The larval form of the moth flies is usually between {{convert|4|and|5|mm|abbr=on}} long, and is shaped like a long, thin, somewhat flattened cylinder.  The body lacks prolegs, but the body segments are divided into a series of rings called ''annuli'' (singular is ''annulus'').  Some of these rings will have characteristic plates on the dorsal side.  The larval thorax is not significantly larger than its abdomen, giving it a more \"worm-like\" appearance than that of most aquatic insect larvae.\n\nIn some species, the larvae can secure themselves to surfaces of their environment using \"attachment disks\" on their ventral side. Like [[mosquito]] larvae, they cannot absorb oxygen through water, and instead breathe via a small dark tube (a [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]) on their posterior end \u2014 they must regularly reach the surface to obtain oxygen.  The larval stage lasts for between 9 and 15 days, depending on species, temperature, and environment.  There are four [[instar]] stages.<ref name=\"OscozGalicia2011\"/><ref name=\"McCafferty1983\">{{cite book|author=W.

However, unless this sludge layer is removed entirely, the adult flies will continue to find it and lay more eggs.\n\nWhile the [[biting midge]]s also have larvae that have no prolegs and which also have attachment disks, the larvae of the netwinged midges can be distinguished from those of the moth fly by the multiple deep lateral constrictions of the latter.<ref name=\"McCafferty1983\"/>\n\nThe pupal stage lasts between 20 and 40 hours.  During this stage, the insect does not feed, but stays submerged near the water surface, still breathing through a spiracle, and soon metamorphoses into an adult fly, which bursts through a seam in the pupal casing and emerges onto the water's surface.\n\nThe adults are half as long as the larvae, but are much broader in appearance, with a pair of hairy wings held pitched-roof-like over the body.  The wings have the most elementary [[Wing venation|venation]] of any of the Diptera, having little more than a series of parallel veins without crossveins.\n\nThe adults are typically nocturnal, though they orient themselves around lights and may appear to be attracted to light and odors. They are erratic fliers, and are often seen walking or running rapidly as well as taking flight.<ref name=\"Townsend\">{{cite web|last1=Townsend|first1=Lee|title=Drain Flies or Moth Flies|url=https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef615|website=Entomology at the University of Kentucky|publisher=University of Kentucky|accessdate=2017-06-21}}</ref> They are most active at night, but may also be seen during daylight, or near windows, lights, or illuminated display panels.<ref name=\"DIYPC\" />\n\nThe adults live for about 20 days, during which they will breed only once, often within hours of emerging from their pupal casings.

The larvae of the most commonly encountered species are nearly transparent with a non-retractable black head and can sometimes be seen moving along the moist edges of crevices in shower stalls or bathtubs or submerged in toilet water.  The larval form of the moth flies is usually between {{convert|4|and|5|mm|abbr=on}} long, and is shaped like a long, thin, somewhat flattened cylinder.  The body lacks prolegs, but the body segments are divided into a series of rings called ''annuli'' (singular is ''annulus'').  Some of these rings will have characteristic plates on the dorsal side.  The larval thorax is not significantly larger than its abdomen, giving it a more \"worm-like\" appearance than that of most aquatic insect larvae.\n\nIn some species, the larvae can secure themselves to surfaces of their environment using \"attachment disks\" on their ventral side. Like [[mosquito]] larvae, they cannot absorb oxygen through water, and instead breathe via a small dark tube (a [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]) on their posterior end \u2014 they must regularly reach the surface to obtain oxygen.  The larval stage lasts for between 9 and 15 days, depending on species, temperature, and environment.  There are four [[instar]] stages.<ref name=\"OscozGalicia2011\"/><ref name=\"McCafferty1983\">{{cite book|author=W.

However, unless this sludge layer is removed entirely, the adult flies will continue to find it and lay more eggs.\n\nWhile the [[biting midge]]s also have larvae that have no prolegs and which also have attachment disks, the larvae of the netwinged midges can be distinguished from those of the moth fly by the multiple deep lateral constrictions of the latter.<ref name=\"McCafferty1983\"/>\n\nThe pupal stage lasts between 20 and 40 hours.  During this stage, the insect does not feed, but stays submerged near the water surface, still breathing through a spiracle, and soon metamorphoses into an adult fly, which bursts through a seam in the pupal casing and emerges onto the water's surface.\n\nThe adults are half as long as the larvae, but are much broader in appearance, with a pair of hairy wings held pitched-roof-like over the body.  The wings have the most elementary [[Wing venation|venation]] of any of the Diptera, having little more than a series of parallel veins without crossveins.\n\nThe adults are typically nocturnal, though they orient themselves around lights and may appear to be attracted to light and odors. They are erratic fliers, and are often seen walking or running rapidly as well as taking flight.<ref name=\"Townsend\">{{cite web|last1=Townsend|first1=Lee|title=Drain Flies or Moth Flies|url=https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef615|website=Entomology at the University of Kentucky|publisher=University of Kentucky|accessdate=2017-06-21}}</ref> They are most active at night, but may also be seen during daylight, or near windows, lights, or illuminated display panels.<ref name=\"DIYPC\" />\n\nThe adults live for about 20 days, during which they will breed only once, often within hours of emerging from their pupal casings.

The holiday was initially only celebrated by young men, hence the initial name \"Bachelors' Day.\" However, it is now widely celebrated by both sexes. \"Blind date\" parties are popular on this day, in an attempt to alter the single status of the participants. Some universities organize special programs to gather singles together for the celebration. Singles may take on an annoyed or self-deprecating attitude in response to remaining single as a university student, but university initiatives have helped curb that negativity.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}Although this date is meant to celebrate singlehood, the desire to find a spouse or partner is often expressed by young Chinese people on this date, while other love-related issues are discussed by the Chinese media.\n\n=== Shopping ===\nThe event is not an officially recognized public holiday in China,<ref name=\"auto\"/> although it has become the largest [[Shopping|offline]] and [[Online shopping|online]] shopping day in the world.<ref name=\"C.

The holiday was initially only celebrated by young men, hence the initial name \"Bachelors' Day.\" However, it is now widely celebrated by both sexes. \"Blind date\" parties are popular on this day, in an attempt to alter the single status of the participants. Some universities organize special programs to gather singles together for the celebration. Singles may take on an annoyed or self-deprecating attitude in response to remaining single as a university student, but university initiatives have helped curb that negativity.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}Although this date is meant to celebrate singlehood, the desire to find a spouse or partner is often expressed by young Chinese people on this date, while other love-related issues are discussed by the Chinese media.\n\n=== Shopping ===\nThe event is not an officially recognized public holiday in China,<ref name=\"auto\"/> although it has become the largest [[Shopping|offline]] and [[Online shopping|online]] shopping day in the world.<ref name=\"C.

This kind of respirator is reusable, with the filters being replaced periodically.]]\n\nA '''respirator''' is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres, including [[particulate matter]] such as dusts and airborne microorganisms, as well as hazardous fumes, vapours and gases. There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'' in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the ''air-supplied respirator'' in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.\n\nAir-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks sometimes referred to as a [[dust mask]] to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges often called a [[gas mask]].\n\n==Physical form==\n[[File:NIOSH P95 cross section.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Cross-section of [[NIOSH air filtration rating|NIOSH-approved]] P95 filters used in [[metalworking]] operations. Even \"clean\" industrial processes often generate large amounts of harmful particulate matter and require breathing protection.]]\nAll respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method.  Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The differences in respirator design impact the [[respirator assigned protection factors]], i.e. the resulting degree of protection which kind of hazard.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThere are three categories of particulate respirators: particulate filtering facepiece respirators are discarded when they become unsuitable for further use due to considerations of hygiene, excessive resistance, or physical damage; Elastomeric respirators are reusable because the facepiece is cleaned and reused, but the filter cartridges are discarded and replaced when they become unsuitable for further use; and [[Powered air-purifying respirator|powered air-purifying respirators]] have a battery-powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest1.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source Information: What are they?|last=|first=|date=2018-01-29|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nRespirators can also have half-face forms that covers the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators can only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is painting an object with spray paint could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with [[chlorine]] gas would have to wear a full-face respirator.\n\n== Types of filtration ==\n\n=== Air-purifying ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Personal protective equipment]] -->\n[[File:Police officer wearing half-mask respirator.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Protective P100 filter mask worn by NYPD officer]]\nAir-purifying respirators are used against particulates, gases, and vapors that are at atmospheric concentrations less than immediately dangerous to life and health. This includes:\n\n*[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] respirators using mechanical filters and chemical media\n*[[positive pressure|positive-pressure]] units such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\n*Escape Only respirators or hoods such as Air-Purifying Escape Respirators for use by the general public for [[chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear]]  (CBRN) terrorism incidents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFull hood, half- or full-facepiece designs are marketed in many varieties depending on the hazard of concern using an [[air filter]] which acts passively on air inhaled by the wearer. Two common examples of this type of respirator are single-use escape hoods and filter masks. The latter are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list below to remove particulates from the air stream.  The most common of these is the disposable white N95 variety. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant. Filter masks also come in replaceable-cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or two cartridges attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and the [[International Safety Equipment Association]] (ISEA) established the American National Standard for Air-Purifying Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices to define both test criteria and approval methods for fire/smoke escape hoods. ANSI/ISEA Standard 110 provides design guidance to manufacturers of Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices (RPED) in the form of performance requirements and testing procedures. The standard covers certification, ISO registration for the manufacturer, associated test methods, labeling, conditioning requirements, independent process and quality control audits, and follow-up inspection programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://safetyequipment.org/c/std110-2009.cfm |title=International Safety Equipment Association |publisher=Safetyequipment.org |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> ANSI/ISEA 110 was prepared by members of the ISEA RPED group, in consultation with testing laboratories and was reviewed by a consensus panel representing users, health and safety professionals and government representatives.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission uses ANSI/ISEA 110 as the benchmark in their testing of fire escape masks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Mechanical filter====\nMechanical filter respirators retain particulate matter such as dust created during [[woodwork]]ing or metal processing, when contaminated air is passed through the filter material. Wool is still used today as a filter, along with plastic, glass, cellulose, and combinations of two or more of these materials. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[File:Atemluftfilter Einwegmaske.jpg|thumb|Filtering half mask with exhalation valve (class: FFP3)]]\n\nMechanical filters remove contaminants from air in the following ways:\n\n# by ''interception'' when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it;\n# by ''impaction'', when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity\n# by an enhancing mechanism called ''diffusion'', where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100&nbsp;nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter; this effect is similar to [[Brownian motion]] and increases the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the two mechanisms above; it becomes dominant at lower air flow velocities\n# by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an [[electrostatic charge]] that holds them on the filter surface;\n# by using gravity and allowing particles to settle into the filter material (this effect is typically negligible); and\n# by using the particles themselves, after the filter has been used, to act as a filter medium for other particles.\n\t\nConsidering only particulates carried on an air stream and a fiber mesh filter, diffusion predominates below the 0.1 \u03bcm diameter particle size. Impaction and interception predominate above 0.4 \u03bcm. In between, near the 0.3 \u03bcm most penetrating particle size, diffusion and interception predominate.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFor maximum efficiency of particle removal and to decrease resistance to airflow through the filter, particulate filters are designed to keep the velocity of air flow through the filter as low as possible. This is achieved by manipulating the slope and shape of the filter to provide larger surface area.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nA substantial advance in mechanical filter technology was{{when|date=March 2017}} the [[HEPA]] filter. A HEPA filter can remove as much as 99.97% of all airborne particulates with aerodynamic diameter of 0.3 \u03bcm, particles both smaller and larger are removed with an efficiency >99.97%.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-136/pdfs/2003-136.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2003136|title=Guidance for Filtration and Air-Cleaning Systems to Protect Building Environments from Airborne Chemical, Biological, or Radiological Attacks|publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|date=April 2003|isbn=|location=Cincinnati, OH|pages=8\u201312|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2003136|access-date=February 9, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] defines the following categories of particulate filters according to their [[NIOSH air filtration rating]] as of 2011:<ref name=\"fact sheet\">{{cite journal| last1 = Metzler | first1 = R| last2 = Szalajda | first2 = J | title = NIOSH Fact Sheet: NIOSH Approval Labels - Key Information to Protect Yourself | journal = DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2011-179 | year = 2011 | url =https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-179/pdfs/2011-179.pdf | issn =0343-6993}}</ref>\n\n[[File:What it Means to be NIOSH-Approved - A look into N95 Certification Testing.webm|thumb|right|300px|A video describing N95 certification testing]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are different units for different environments. The units consist of a powered [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] which forces incoming air through one or more [[filter (air)|filter]]s to the user for breathing. The fan and filters may be carried by the user or they may be remotely mounted and the user breathes the air through tubing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe filter type must be matched to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some PAPR's are designed to remove fine particulate matter, while others are suitable for working with [[volatile organic compound]]s as those in [[spray paint]]s. These must have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)===\n{{Main|Self-contained breathing apparatus}}\n\nA self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) typically has three main components: a high-pressure air cylinder (e.g., 2200 psi to 4500 psi), a pressure gauge and regulator, and an inhalation connection (mouthpiece, mouth mask or full face mask), connected together and mounted to a carrying frame or a harness with adjustable shoulder straps and belt so it can be worn on the back. There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOpen-circuit industrial breathing sets are filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. Air cylinders are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The \"positive pressure\" type is common, which supplies a steady stream of air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA's are of the \"demand\" type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe closed-circuit type SCBA filters, supplements, and recirculates exhaled gas like a [[rebreather]].

Some were [[rubber]], some were made of rubberized fabric, and still others of impregnated fabric, but in most cases a tank of compressed air or a reservoir of air under slight pressure was carried by the wearer to supply the necessary breathing air. In some devices certain means were provided for the adsorption of [[carbon dioxide]] in exhaled air and the rebreathing of the same air many times; in other cases valves allowed exhalation of used air.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:John Stenhouse's mask.png|thumb|right|Woodcut of Stenhouse's mask]]\n[[File:How a Man may Breath Safely in a Poisonous Atmosphere b10154140 010 tif zw12z649n.tiff|thumb|right| \"How a Man may Breath Safely in a Poisonous Atmosphere\", an apparatus providing oxygen while using caustic soda to absorb carbon dioxide, 1909]]\nIn 1848, the first US patent for an air purifying respirator was granted to [[Lewis P.

It was the first time Germany used [[chemical weapon]]s on a large scale releasing 168 tons of [[chlorine gas]] over a four-mile (6&nbsp;km) front killing around 6,000 troops within ten minutes through [[asphyxiation]]. The gas being denser than air flowed downwards forcing troops to climb out of their [[trenches]]. Reserve Canadian troops, who were away from the attack, used [[urine]]-soaked cloths as primitive respirators. A Canadian soldier realized that the [[ammonia]] in urine would react with the chlorine, neutralizing it, and that the water would dissolve the chlorine, allowing soldiers to breathe through the gas.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\nChina normally makes 10 million masks<!-- or [[dust mask]] or [[surgical mask]]--> per day, about half of the world production.

This kind of respirator is reusable, with the filters being replaced periodically.]]\n\nA '''respirator''' is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres, including [[particulate matter]] such as dusts and airborne microorganisms, as well as hazardous fumes, vapours and gases. There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'' in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the ''air-supplied respirator'' in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.\n\nAir-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks sometimes referred to as a [[dust mask]] to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges often called a [[gas mask]].\n\n==Physical form==\n[[File:NIOSH P95 cross section.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Cross-section of [[NIOSH air filtration rating|NIOSH-approved]] P95 filters used in [[metalworking]] operations. Even \"clean\" industrial processes often generate large amounts of harmful particulate matter and require breathing protection.]]\nAll respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method.  Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The differences in respirator design impact the [[respirator assigned protection factors]], i.e. the resulting degree of protection which kind of hazard.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThere are three categories of particulate respirators: particulate filtering facepiece respirators are discarded when they become unsuitable for further use due to considerations of hygiene, excessive resistance, or physical damage; Elastomeric respirators are reusable because the facepiece is cleaned and reused, but the filter cartridges are discarded and replaced when they become unsuitable for further use; and [[Powered air-purifying respirator|powered air-purifying respirators]] have a battery-powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest1.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source Information: What are they?|last=|first=|date=2018-01-29|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nRespirators can also have half-face forms that covers the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators can only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is painting an object with spray paint could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with [[chlorine]] gas would have to wear a full-face respirator.\n\n== Types of filtration ==\n\n=== Air-purifying ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Personal protective equipment]] -->\n[[File:Police officer wearing half-mask respirator.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Protective P100 filter mask worn by NYPD officer]]\nAir-purifying respirators are used against particulates, gases, and vapors that are at atmospheric concentrations less than immediately dangerous to life and health. This includes:\n\n*[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] respirators using mechanical filters and chemical media\n*[[positive pressure|positive-pressure]] units such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\n*Escape Only respirators or hoods such as Air-Purifying Escape Respirators for use by the general public for [[chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear]]  (CBRN) terrorism incidents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFull hood, half- or full-facepiece designs are marketed in many varieties depending on the hazard of concern using an [[air filter]] which acts passively on air inhaled by the wearer. Two common examples of this type of respirator are single-use escape hoods and filter masks. The latter are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list below to remove particulates from the air stream.  The most common of these is the disposable white N95 variety. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant. Filter masks also come in replaceable-cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or two cartridges attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and the [[International Safety Equipment Association]] (ISEA) established the American National Standard for Air-Purifying Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices to define both test criteria and approval methods for fire/smoke escape hoods. ANSI/ISEA Standard 110 provides design guidance to manufacturers of Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices (RPED) in the form of performance requirements and testing procedures. The standard covers certification, ISO registration for the manufacturer, associated test methods, labeling, conditioning requirements, independent process and quality control audits, and follow-up inspection programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://safetyequipment.org/c/std110-2009.cfm |title=International Safety Equipment Association |publisher=Safetyequipment.org |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> ANSI/ISEA 110 was prepared by members of the ISEA RPED group, in consultation with testing laboratories and was reviewed by a consensus panel representing users, health and safety professionals and government representatives.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission uses ANSI/ISEA 110 as the benchmark in their testing of fire escape masks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Mechanical filter====\nMechanical filter respirators retain particulate matter such as dust created during [[woodwork]]ing or metal processing, when contaminated air is passed through the filter material. Wool is still used today as a filter, along with plastic, glass, cellulose, and combinations of two or more of these materials. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[File:Atemluftfilter Einwegmaske.jpg|thumb|Filtering half mask with exhalation valve (class: FFP3)]]\n\nMechanical filters remove contaminants from air in the following ways:\n\n# by ''interception'' when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it;\n# by ''impaction'', when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity\n# by an enhancing mechanism called ''diffusion'', where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100&nbsp;nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter; this effect is similar to [[Brownian motion]] and increases the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the two mechanisms above; it becomes dominant at lower air flow velocities\n# by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an [[electrostatic charge]] that holds them on the filter surface;\n# by using gravity and allowing particles to settle into the filter material (this effect is typically negligible); and\n# by using the particles themselves, after the filter has been used, to act as a filter medium for other particles.\n\t\nConsidering only particulates carried on an air stream and a fiber mesh filter, diffusion predominates below the 0.1 \u03bcm diameter particle size. Impaction and interception predominate above 0.4 \u03bcm. In between, near the 0.3 \u03bcm most penetrating particle size, diffusion and interception predominate.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFor maximum efficiency of particle removal and to decrease resistance to airflow through the filter, particulate filters are designed to keep the velocity of air flow through the filter as low as possible. This is achieved by manipulating the slope and shape of the filter to provide larger surface area.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nA substantial advance in mechanical filter technology was{{when|date=March 2017}} the [[HEPA]] filter. A HEPA filter can remove as much as 99.97% of all airborne particulates with aerodynamic diameter of 0.3 \u03bcm, particles both smaller and larger are removed with an efficiency >99.97%.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-136/pdfs/2003-136.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2003136|title=Guidance for Filtration and Air-Cleaning Systems to Protect Building Environments from Airborne Chemical, Biological, or Radiological Attacks|publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|date=April 2003|isbn=|location=Cincinnati, OH|pages=8\u201312|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2003136|access-date=February 9, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] defines the following categories of particulate filters according to their [[NIOSH air filtration rating]] as of 2011:<ref name=\"fact sheet\">{{cite journal| last1 = Metzler | first1 = R| last2 = Szalajda | first2 = J | title = NIOSH Fact Sheet: NIOSH Approval Labels - Key Information to Protect Yourself | journal = DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2011-179 | year = 2011 | url =https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-179/pdfs/2011-179.pdf | issn =0343-6993}}</ref>\n\n[[File:What it Means to be NIOSH-Approved - A look into N95 Certification Testing.webm|thumb|right|300px|A video describing N95 certification testing]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are different units for different environments. The units consist of a powered [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] which forces incoming air through one or more [[filter (air)|filter]]s to the user for breathing. The fan and filters may be carried by the user or they may be remotely mounted and the user breathes the air through tubing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe filter type must be matched to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some PAPR's are designed to remove fine particulate matter, while others are suitable for working with [[volatile organic compound]]s as those in [[spray paint]]s. These must have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)===\n{{Main|Self-contained breathing apparatus}}\n\nA self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) typically has three main components: a high-pressure air cylinder (e.g., 2200 psi to 4500 psi), a pressure gauge and regulator, and an inhalation connection (mouthpiece, mouth mask or full face mask), connected together and mounted to a carrying frame or a harness with adjustable shoulder straps and belt so it can be worn on the back. There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOpen-circuit industrial breathing sets are filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. Air cylinders are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The \"positive pressure\" type is common, which supplies a steady stream of air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA's are of the \"demand\" type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe closed-circuit type SCBA filters, supplements, and recirculates exhaled gas like a [[rebreather]]. It is used when a longer-duration supply of breathing gas is needed, such as in mine rescue and in long tunnels, and going through passages too narrow for a large open-circuit air cylinder.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Industries using respirators==\nA wide range of industries use respirators including healthcare & pharmaceuticals, defense & public safety services (defense, firefighting & law enforcement), oil and gas industries, manufacturing (automotive, chemical, metal fabrication, food and beverage, wood working, paper and pulp), mining, construction, agriculture and forestry, cement production, power generation, shipbuilding and the textile industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/osnr0014.txt|title=Respirator use and practices|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Correct usage ==\n[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace protection factor (PF)]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters.

It was the first time Germany used [[chemical weapon]]s on a large scale releasing 168 tons of [[chlorine gas]] over a four-mile (6&nbsp;km) front killing around 6,000 troops within ten minutes through [[asphyxiation]]. The gas being denser than air flowed downwards forcing troops to climb out of their [[trenches]].
