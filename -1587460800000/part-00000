The stadium was opened on 12 August 2000 and stands on the site of the club's old pitch. The club name is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"The County\". They are nicknamed ''Superboeren'' (\"Super Farmers\").\n\nWhile not a large club by European club football standards, the club has remained a semi-permanent fixture in the [[Eredivisie]] (top league); although to date it has never won any silverware of importance. It also has a large stadium and a large fan base when compared to many other Dutch teams, particularly those in the [[Eerste Divisie]]. They had a fierce rivalry with [[Vitesse Arnhem]], but during the years due several circumstances [[Go Ahead Eagles]] began to be a rival as well.\n\nThe club's colors are blue and white hooped shirts with white shorts and blue socks. The club's major sponsors are [[Pincvision]] and {{ill|ATAG (company)|lt=ATAG|nl|ATAG}}.\n\nDe Graafschap's home base, De Vijverberg has been voted as the most atmospheric stadium in the [[Eredivisie]] for the [[2018-19 Eredivisie|2018-19]] campaign\n\n==History==\nDe Graafschap had their longest streak in the Dutch top tier from 1995 until 2003. In the 1995-96 season De Graafschap finished in 8th place, an all time high. After this season results went down and in 2003 the club was relegated after finishing in last place (18th).\n\nSince 2003, De Graafschap was relegated four times and gained promotion five times. They were crowned champions of the Eerste Divisie in 2007 and 2010, and won the promotion playoffs in 2004 and 2015.<ref>[http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/nationaal/24101401/__De_Graafschap_terug_in_eredivisie__.html De Graafschap terug in eredivisie]&nbsp;\u2013 Telegraaf {{in lang|nl}}</ref> De Graafschap never finished last in the Eredivisie since 2003 but lost relegation playoffs after finishing in 17th place in 2005, 2009 and 2012.<ref>[http://nos.nl/artikel/372611-de-graafschap-gedegradeerd.html De Graafschap gedegradeerd]&nbsp;\u2013 NOS {{in lang|nl}}</ref> In the 2015-16 Eredivisie season De Graafschap were once again relegated through playoffs after finishing 17th but not before drawing 1-1 against [[AFC Ajax]] on the final day of the season, denying Ajax the championship.

club from [[Doetinchem]], [[Netherlands]], playing in the [[Eerste divisie]], the second professional tier of football in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nIt was formed on 1 February 1954 and they play their home games at the De Vijverberg stadium. The stadium was opened on 12 August 2000 and stands on the site of the club's old pitch. The club name is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"The County\". They are nicknamed ''Superboeren'' (\"Super Farmers\").\n\nWhile not a large club by European club football standards, the club has remained a semi-permanent fixture in the [[Eredivisie]] (top league); although to date it has never won any silverware of importance. It also has a large stadium and a large fan base when compared to many other Dutch teams, particularly those in the [[Eerste Divisie]]. They had a fierce rivalry with [[Vitesse Arnhem]], but during the years due several circumstances [[Go Ahead Eagles]] began to be a rival as well.\n\nThe club's colors are blue and white hooped shirts with white shorts and blue socks. The club's major sponsors are [[Pincvision]] and {{ill|ATAG (company)|lt=ATAG|nl|ATAG}}.\n\nDe Graafschap's home base, De Vijverberg has been voted as the most atmospheric stadium in the [[Eredivisie]] for the [[2018-19 Eredivisie|2018-19]] campaign\n\n==History==\nDe Graafschap had their longest streak in the Dutch top tier from 1995 until 2003. In the 1995-96 season De Graafschap finished in 8th place, an all time high. After this season results went down and in 2003 the club was relegated after finishing in last place (18th).\n\nSince 2003, De Graafschap was relegated four times and gained promotion five times. They were crowned champions of the Eerste Divisie in 2007 and 2010, and won the promotion playoffs in 2004 and 2015.<ref>[http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/nationaal/24101401/__De_Graafschap_terug_in_eredivisie__.html De Graafschap terug in eredivisie]&nbsp;\u2013 Telegraaf {{in lang|nl}}</ref> De Graafschap never finished last in the Eredivisie since 2003 but lost relegation playoffs after finishing in 17th place in 2005, 2009 and 2012.<ref>[http://nos.nl/artikel/372611-de-graafschap-gedegradeerd.html De Graafschap gedegradeerd]&nbsp;\u2013 NOS {{in lang|nl}}</ref> In the 2015-16 Eredivisie season De Graafschap were once again relegated through playoffs after finishing 17th but not before drawing 1-1 against [[AFC Ajax]] on the final day of the season, denying Ajax the championship. In 2018, the club gained promotion again by winning the promotion playoffs, beating [[Almere City FC]] in the playoffs finals.

While prisons are considered punishment, they also are intended to have the purpose of future crime prevention. A recent study found that of $74 billion total spent on incarceration among federal, state and local prisons, less than 1% of that was spent on prevention and treatment. Incarceration not only harms the individual as intended, but also has unintended negative effects on the inmate's family, community, and overall society. Inmate education has been shown to reduce recidivism. Evidence shows that inmates overwhelmingly take advantage of education programs if they are available to them and if they can afford them. A recent study showed the earning a GED while incarcerate reduced recidivism rates by 14% for those under 21, and 5% for those over 21. Substance abuse is also a major issue in the prison system. Between 1996 and 2006, despite a modest population increase of 12%, the number of incarcerated individuals rose by 33% and the number of substance-abusing individuals rose by 43%. Existing treatment programs have shown solid evidence that drug treatment programs, along with support after release, are effective at reducing recidivism. Emotional and mental health counseling is a core component of successful inmate rehabilitation. Without the proper innate motivation and desire from the inmate, attempts to educate or assist with substance abuse are less effective. A study revealed that more than half of those incarcerated had a mental health problem, defined as a recent history or symptoms of a mental health problem within the previous 12 months.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reich |first=Jacob | title=The Economic Impact of Prison Rehabilitation Programs | website=Wharton Public Policy Initative | date=17 August 2017 | url=https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/2059-the-economic-impact-of-prison-rehabilitation | access-date=24 March 2020}}</ref> [[California|California's]] [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile justice]] system is based on rehabilitation instead of [[Criminal punishment|punishment]].<ref>{{cite web |title= California Welfare and Institutions Code Section 202 |url= http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=WIC&sectionNum=202. |publisher= [[California Office of Legislative Counsel]] |accessdate= 2018-09-30 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Psychopathy and recidivism==\nCriminal [[recidivism]] is highly correlated with [[psychopathy]].<ref name=\"Jill S.

Thousands of Bucharest residents were evicted from their homes, which were subsequently demolished to make room for the huge structures.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lake |first=Quintin |url=http://blog.quintinlake.com/2011/12/12/photos-ceausescus-palace-of-the-parliament-bucharest/ |title=Photos: Ceausescu's Palace of the Parliament, Bucharest &#124; Geometry & Silence |publisher=Blog.quintinlake.com |date=2011-12-12 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the other [[Warsaw Pact]] leaders, Ceau\u0219escu had not been slavishly pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] but rather had pursued an \"independent\" foreign policy; Romanian forces did not join their Warsaw Pact allies in putting an end to the [[Prague Spring]]\u2014an [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion]] Ceau\u0219escu [[Ceau\u0219escu's speech of 21 August 1968|openly denounced]]\u2014while [[Romania at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Romanian athletes]] competed at the Soviet-boycotted [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles (receiving a standing ovation at the opening ceremonies and proceeding to win 53 medals, trailing only the US and [[West Germany]] in the overall count).<ref name = lat_ovation>{{cite web|last=Mitchell| first = Houston |title = L.A.'s greatest sports moments No. 3: 1984 Olympics opening|url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2011/12/las-greatest-sports-moments-no-3-the-1984-olympics-opening-ceremony.html |work= The Los Angeles Times| date =9 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=medal_tab>{{cite web|title=1984 Los Angeles Summer Games|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1984/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707092752/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1984/|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 July 2008|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref> Conversely, while [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] spoke of reform, Ceau\u0219escu maintained a hard political line and cult of personality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/items/show/692 |title=Minutes of the Meeting between Nicolae Ceausescu and Mikhail Gorbachev, December 1989 &#124; Making the History of 1989 |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date=1990-01-09 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe austerity programme started in 1981 and the widespread poverty it introduced made the Communist regime very unpopular. The austerity programmes were met with little resistance among Romanians and there were only a few strikes and labour disputes, of which the [[Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977]] and the [[Bra\u0219ov Rebellion]] of November 1987 at the truck manufacturer [[Roman (vehicle manufacturer)|Steagul Ro\u0219u]] were the most notable. In March 1989, several leading activists of the PCR criticised Ceau\u0219escu's economic policies in a [[Letter of the Six|letter]], but shortly thereafter he achieved a significant political victory: Romania paid off its external debt of about US$11 billion several months before the time that even the Romanian dictator expected. However, in the months following the austerity program, shortages of goods remained the same as before.\n \nLike the [[Neues Deutschland|East German state newspaper]], official Romanian news organs made no mention of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in the first days following 9 November 1989.  The most notable news in Romanian newspapers of 11 November 1989, was the \"masterly lecture by comrade Nicolae Ceausescu at the extended plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Romania,\" in which the Romanian head of state and party highly praised the \"brilliant program for the work and revolutionary struggle of all our people,\" as well as the \"exemplary fulfillment of economic tasks.\" What had happened 1,500 km northwest of Bucharest, in divided Berlin, during those days is not even mentioned. Socialism is praised as the \"way of the free, independent development of the peoples.\"  The same day, on Bucharest's Brezoianu Street and Kog\u0103lniceanu Boulevard, a group of students from [[Cluj-Napoca]] attempted a demonstration but were quickly apprehended. It initially appeared that Ceau\u0219escu would weather the wave of revolution sweeping across Eastern Europe, as he was formally re-elected for another five-year term as [[General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party]] on 24 November at the party's XIV Congress. On that same day, Ceau\u0219escu's counterpart in [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]], [[Milo\u0161 Jake\u0161]], resigned along with the entire Communist leadership, effectively [[Velvet Revolution|ending Communist rule in Czechoslovakia]].  \n\nThe three students, Mihnea Paraschivescu, Gra\u021bian Vulpe, and the economist Dan C\u0103prariu-Schlachter from Cluj, were detained and investigated by the Securitate at the Rahova Penitentiary on suspicion of propaganda against the socialist society. They were released on 22 December 1989 at 14:00. There were other letters and attempts to draw attention to the economic, cultural, and spiritual oppression of Romanians, but they served only to intensify the activity of the police and Securitate. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Timi\u0219oara uprising==\n[[File:1989 December 16. sug\u00e1r\u00fat \u00e9s a Tudor Vladimirescu \u00fat keresztez\u0151d\u00e9se.

For some time his parishioners gathered around his home to protect him from harassment and eviction. Many passersby spontaneously joined in. As it became clear that the crowd would not disperse, the mayor, Petre Mo\u021b, made remarks suggesting that he had overturned the decision to evict T\u0151k\u00e9s. Meanwhile, the crowd had grown impatient and, when Mo\u021b declined to confirm his statement against the planned eviction in writing, the crowd started to chant anti-communist slogans. Subsequently, police and ''Securitate'' forces showed up at the scene. By 19:30 the protest had spread and the original cause became largely irrelevant.\n\nSome of the protesters attempted to burn down the building that housed the district committee of the PCR. The ''Securitate'' responded with [[tear gas]] and water jets, while police beat up rioters and arrested many of them. Around 21:00 the rioters withdrew. They regrouped eventually around the [[Timi\u0219oara Orthodox Cathedral|Romanian Orthodox Cathedral]] and started a protest march around the city, but again they were confronted by the security forces.\n\n===Crackdown===\n{{One source\n| date = September 2019\n}}[[File:Romania, Transylvania, Timisoara Fortepan 31879.jpg|thumb|People detained after 22 December 1989 in Timi\u015foara]]\n\nRiots and protests resumed the following day, 17 December. The rioters broke into the district committee building and threw party documents, propaganda brochures, Ceau\u0219escu's writings, and other symbols of Communist power out of windows.<ref name=\":0\">\u0218tef\u0103nescu, pp. 1\u201327</ref>\n\nThe military was sent in to control the riots, because the situation was too large for the ''Securitate'' and conventional police to handle. The presence of the army in the streets was an ominous one: It meant that they had received their orders from the highest level of the command chain, presumably from Ceau\u0219escu himself. The army failed to establish order and chaos ensued, including gunfire, fights, casualties, and burned cars. [[TAB (Romanian Land Forces)|Transportor Amfibiu Blindat]] (TAB) [[armored personnel carriers|armoured personnel carriers]] and tanks were called in.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter 20:00, from Pia\u021ba Libert\u0103\u021bii (Liberty Square) to the Opera, there was wild shooting, including the area of Decebal bridge, Calea Lipovei (Lipovei Avenue) and Calea Girocului (Girocului Avenue). Tanks, trucks and TABs blocked the accesses into the city while helicopters hovered overhead. After midnight the protests calmed down. Colonel-General Ion Coman, local Party secretary Ilie Matei, and Colonel-General [[\u0218tefan Gu\u0219\u0103]] ([[Chief of the Romanian General Staff]]) inspected the city. Some areas looked like the aftermath of a war: destruction, rubble and blood.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Rom\u00e1n Nemzeti Sz\u00ednh\u00e1z \u00e9s Operah\u00e1z, T-55 harckocsi.

Mayor Mo\u021b ordered a party gathering to take place at the university, with the purpose of condemning the \"vandalism\" of the previous days. He also declared [[martial law]], prohibiting people from going about in groups of larger than two.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDefying the curfew, a group of 30 young men headed for the Orthodox cathedral, where they stopped and waved a [[Flag of Romania#1989: the revolution|Romanian flag]] from which they had removed the Romanian Communist coat of arms leaving a distinctive hole, in a manner similar to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. Expecting that they would be fired upon, they started to sing \"[[De\u0219teapt\u0103-te, rom\u00e2ne!]]\" (''\"Awaken thee, Romanian!\"''), an earlier patriotic song that had been banned since 1947. They were, indeed, fired upon; some died and others were seriously injured, while the lucky ones were able to escape.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 19 December, local Party functionary Radu B\u0103lan and Colonel-General \u0218tefan Gu\u0219\u0103 visited workers in the city's factories, but failed to get them to resume work. On 20 December, massive columns of workers entered the city. About 100,000 protesters occupied Pia\u021ba Operei (Opera Square \u2013 today Pia\u021ba Victoriei, Victory Square) and chanted anti-government slogans: ''\"Noi suntem poporul!\"'' (\"We are the people!\"), ''\"Armata e cu noi!\"'' (\"The army is on our side!\"), ''\"Nu v\u0103 fie fric\u0103, Ceau\u0219escu pic\u0103!\"'' (\"Have no fear, Ceau\u0219escu is falling!\")<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMeanwhile, [[Emil Bobu]] (Secretary to the Central Committee) and Prime Minister [[Constantin D\u0103sc\u0103lescu]] were sent by Elena Ceau\u0219escu (Nicolae being at that time in [[Iran]]) to resolve the situation. They met with a delegation of the protesters and agreed to free the majority of the arrested protesters. However, they refused to comply with the protesters' main demand (resignation of Ceau\u0219escu) and the situation remained essentially unchanged.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe next day, trains loaded with workers from factories in [[Oltenia]] arrived in Timi\u0219oara. The regime was attempting to use them to repress the mass protests, but after a brief encounter they ended up joining the protests. One worker explained, \"Yesterday our factory boss and a party official rounded us up in the yard, handed us wooden clubs and told us that Hungarians and 'hooligans' were devastating Timi\u0219oara and that it is our duty to go there and help crush the riots. But I realised that wasn't the truth.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 18 December, Ceau\u0219escu had departed for a visit to Iran, leaving the duty of crushing the Timi\u0219oara revolt to his subordinates and his wife. Upon his return on the evening of 20 December, the situation became even more tense, and he gave a televised speech from the TV studio inside the Central Committee Building (CC Building) in which he spoke about the events at Timi\u0219oara in terms of an \"interference of foreign forces in Romania's internal affairs\" and an \"external aggression on Romania's sovereignty.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe country, which had no information about the Timi\u0219oara events from the national media, heard about the Timi\u0219oara revolt from Western radio stations like [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe]], and by word of mouth. A mass meeting was staged for the next day, 21 December, which, according to the official media, was presented as a \"spontaneous movement of support for Ceau\u0219escu,\" emulating the 1968 meeting in which Ceau\u0219escu had spoken against the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Revolution spreads==\n===Ceau\u0219escu's speech===\nOn the morning of 21 December, Ceau\u0219escu addressed an assembly of approximately 100,000 people to condemn the uprising in Timi\u0219oara. Party officials took great pains to make it appear that Ceau\u0219escu was still immensely popular. Several busloads of workers, under threat of being fired, arrived in Bucharest's Pia\u021ba Palatului (Palace Square, now [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Pia\u021ba Revolu\u021biei]] \u2013 Revolution Square) and were given red flags, banners and large pictures of Ceau\u0219escu. They were augmented by bystanders who were rounded up on Calea Victoriei.<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Revolutie Bucuresti1.JPG|thumb|left|The balcony where Ceau\u0219escu delivered his last speech, taken over by the crowd during the Romanian Revolution of 1989]]\n\nThe speech was typical of most of Ceau\u0219escu's speeches over the years. Making liberal use of Marxist-Leninist rhetoric, he delivered a litany of the achievements of the \"socialist revolution\" and Romanian \"multi-laterally developed socialist society\". He blamed the Timi\u0219oara uprising on \"fascist agitators\". However, Ceau\u0219escu was out of touch with his people and completely misread the crowd's mood. The people remained unresponsive, and only the front rows supported Ceau\u0219escu with cheers and applause. About two minutes into the speech, some in the crowd actually began to jeer, boo, whistle and yell insults at him, a reaction unthinkable for most of his rule. Workers from a Bucharest power plant started chanting \"Ti-mi-\u0219oa-ra! Ti-mi-\u0219oa-ra!\", which was soon picked up by others in the crowd. In response, Ceau\u0219escu raised his right hand in hopes of silencing the crowd; his stunned expression remains one of the defining moments of the end of Communism in Eastern Europe. He then tried to placate the crowd by offering to raise workers' salaries by 200 [[Romanian leu|lei]] per month (about 19 [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] at the time, yet a 5%\u201310% raise for a modest salary) and student scholarships from 100 to 110 lei while continuing to praise the achievements of the Socialist Revolution. However, a revolution was brewing right in front of his eyes.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nAs Ceau\u0219escu was addressing the crowd from the balcony of the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Central Committee building]], sudden movement came from the outskirts of the massed assembly, as did the sound of (what various sources have reported as) fireworks, bombs or guns, which together caused the assembly to break into chaos. Initially frightened, the crowds tried to disperse. [[Bullhorn]]s then began to spread the news that the Securitate was firing on the crowd and that a \"revolution\" was unfolding. This persuaded people in the assembly to join in. The rally turned into a protest demonstration.\n\n[[File:PozeRevolutia1989clujByRazvanRotta13.jpg|thumb|Protesters in [[Cluj-Napoca]] on the morning of 21 December. This photo was taken by R\u0103zvan Rotta after security forces opened fire.]]\n\nThe entire speech was being broadcast live nationwide. Censors attempted to cut the live video feed and replace it with Communist propaganda songs and video praising the Ceau\u0219escu regime, but parts of the riots had already been broadcast and most of the Romanian people realised that something unusual was in progress. Ceau\u0219escu and his wife, as well as other officials and CPEx members, panicked; Ceau\u0219escu's bodyguard hustled him back inside the building.\n\nThe jeers and whistles soon erupted into a riot; the crowd took to the streets, placing the capital, like Timi\u0219oara, in turmoil. Members of the crowd spontaneously began shouting anti-Ceau\u0219escu slogans, which spread and became chants: ''\"Jos dictatorul!\"'' (\"Down with the dictator\"), ''\"Moarte criminalului!\"'' (\"Death to the criminal\"), ''\"Noi suntem poporul, jos cu dictatorul!\"'' (\"We are the People, down with the dictator\"), ''\"Ceau\u0219escu cine e\u0219ti?/Criminal din Scornice\u0219ti\"'' (\"Ceau\u0219escu, who are you?  A criminal from [[Scornice\u0219ti]]\").<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nProtesters eventually flooded the city centre area, from Pia\u021ba Kog\u0103lniceanu to [[Pia\u021ba Unirii]], [[Pia\u021ba Rosetti]] and [[Pia\u021ba Roman\u0103]]. In one notable scene from the event, a young man waved a [[History of the flags of Romania#Flag of the Romanian Revolution of 1989|tricolour]] with the Communist coat of arms torn out of its centre while perched on the statue of [[Mihai Viteazul]] on Boulevard Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu in the [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]]. Many others began to emulate the young protester, and the waving and displaying of the Romanian flag with the Communist insignia cut out quickly became widespread.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Street confrontations===\n{{One source|date=September 2019}}\nAs the hours passed many more people took to the streets. Later, observers claimed that even at this point, had Ceau\u0219escu been willing to talk, he might have been able to salvage something. Instead, he decided on force.<ref name=Revolution1989/>  Soon the protesters\u2014unarmed and unorganised\u2014were confronted by soldiers, tanks, APCs, [[Brigada Antiterorist\u0103|USLA]] troops (''Unitatea Special\u0103 pentru Lupta Antiterorist\u0103'', anti-terrorist special squads) and armed plainclothes ''Securitate'' officers. The crowd was soon being shot at from various buildings, side streets and tanks.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere were many casualties, including deaths, as victims were shot, clubbed to death, stabbed and crushed by armoured vehicles. One APC drove into the crowd around the [[InterContinental Bucharest|InterContinental Hotel]], crushing people. A French journalist, Jean-Louis Calderon, was killed. A street near University Square was later named after him, as well as a high school in Timi\u0219oara. Belgian journalist [[Danny Huw\u00e9]] was shot and killed on 23 or 24 December 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newseum.org/scripts/Journalist/Detail.asp?PhotoID=50 |title=Details for HUWE, DANNY |publisher=Newseum.org |accessdate=2012-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302223000/http://www.newseum.org/scripts/Journalist/Detail.asp?PhotoID=50 |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=APPublished: 26 December 1989 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/26/world/upheaval-in-the-east-2-journalists-killed-in-rumanian-combat.html?pagewanted=1 |title=UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST; 2 Journalists Killed in Rumanian Combat \u2013 New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-12-26 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://enciclopediaromaniei.ro/wiki/Danny_Huwe |title=Danny Huwe \u2013 Enciclopedia Rom\u00e2niei \u2013 prima enciclopedie online despre Rom\u00e2nia |language=ro |publisher=Enciclopediaromaniei.ro |date= |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ABI100 KingFerdinandMuseum.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|An [[ABI (armored vehicle)|ABI]] armoured car used by the [[Brigada Antiterorist\u0103|USLA]] in December 1989]]\n\nFirefighters hit the demonstrators with powerful water jets, and the police continued to beat and arrest people. Protesters managed to build a defensible barricade in front of the ''Dun\u0103rea'' (\"Danube\") restaurant, which stood until after midnight, but was finally torn apart by government forces. Intense shooting continued until after 03:00, by which time the survivors had fled the streets.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRecords of the fighting that day include footage shot from [[helicopter]]s that were sent to raid the area and record evidence for eventual reprisals, as well as by tourists in the high tower of the centrally located InterContinental Hotel, next to the [[Romanian National Theater|National Theatre]] and across the street from the university.\n\nIt is likely that in the early hours of 22 December the Ceau\u0219escus made their second mistake. Instead of fleeing the city under cover of night, they decided to wait until morning to leave. Ceau\u0219escu must have thought that his desperate attempts to crush the protests had succeeded, because he apparently called another meeting for the next morning. However, before 07:00, his wife Elena received the news that large columns of workers from many industrial platforms (large communist-era factories or groups of factories concentrated into industrial zones) were heading towards the city centre of Bucharest to join the protests. The police barricades that were meant to block access to Pia\u021ba Universit\u0103\u021bii (University Square) and Palace Square proved useless. By 09:30 University Square was jammed with protesters. Security forces (army, police and others) re-entered the area, only to join with the protesters.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy 10:00, as the radio broadcast was announcing the introduction of martial law and a ban on groups larger than five persons, hundreds of thousands of people were gathering for the first time, spontaneously, in central Bucharest (the previous day's crowd had come together at Ceau\u0219escu's orders). Ceau\u0219escu attempted to address the crowd from the balcony of the Central Committee of the Communist Party building, but his attempt was met with a wave of disapproval and anger. Helicopters spread manifestos (which did not reach the crowd, due to unfavourable winds) instructing people not to fall victim to the latest \"diversion attempts,\" but to go home instead and enjoy the Christmas feast. This order, which drew unfavourable comparisons to [[Marie Antoinette]]'s haughty (but apocryphal) \"[[Let them eat cake]]\", further infuriated the people who did read the manifestos; many at that time had trouble procuring basic foodstuffs such as cooking oil.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Military defection and Ceau\u0219escu's fall==\nAt approximately 09:30 on the morning of 22 December [[Vasile Milea]], Ceau\u0219escu's minister of defence, died under suspicious circumstances. A communiqu\u00e9 by Ceau\u0219escu stated that Milea had been sacked for treason, and that he had committed suicide after his treason was revealed.<ref name=\":0\" /> The most widespread opinion at the time was that Milea hesitated to follow Ceau\u0219escu's orders to fire on the demonstrators, even though tanks had been dispatched to downtown Bucharest that morning.  Milea was already in severe disfavour with Ceau\u0219escu for initially sending soldiers to Timi\u0219oara without live [[ammunition]]. Rank-and-file soldiers believed that Milea had actually been murdered and went over virtually ''en masse'' to the revolution. Senior commanders wrote off Ceau\u0219escu as a lost cause and made no effort to keep their men loyal to the regime. This effectively ended any chance of Ceau\u0219escu staying in power.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nAccounts differ about how Milea died. His family and several junior officers believed he had been shot in his own office by the Securitate, while another group of officers believed he had committed suicide.<ref name=Revolution1989/>  In 2005 an investigation concluded that the minister killed himself by shooting at his heart, but the bullet missed the heart, hit a nearby artery and led to his death shortly afterward.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nUpon learning of Milea's death, Ceau\u0219escu appointed [[Victor St\u0103nculescu]] minister of defence. He accepted after a brief hesitation. St\u0103nculescu, however, ordered the troops back to their quarters without Ceau\u0219escu's knowledge, and also persuaded Ceau\u0219escu to leave by helicopter, thus making the dictator a fugitive. At that same moment angry protesters began storming the Communist Party headquarters; St\u0103nculescu and the soldiers under his command did not oppose them.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy refusing to carry out Ceau\u0219escu's orders (he was still technically commander-in-chief of the army), St\u0103nculescu played a central role in the overthrow of the dictatorship. \"I had the prospect of two execution squads: Ceau\u0219escu's and the revolutionary one!\" confessed St\u0103nculescu later. In the afternoon, St\u0103nculescu \"chose\" [[Ion Iliescu]]'s political group from among others that were striving for power in the aftermath of the recent events.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Helicopter extraction===\nFollowing Ceau\u0219escu's second failed attempt to address the crowd, he and Elena fled into a lift headed for the roof. A group of protesters managed to force their way into the building, overpower Ceau\u0219escu's bodyguards and make their way through his office before heading onto the balcony. They didn't know it, but they were only a few metres from Ceau\u0219escu. The lift's electricity failed just before it reached the top floor, and Ceau\u0219escu's bodyguards forced it open and ushered the couple onto the roof.<ref name = Revolution1989 />\n\nAt 11:20 on 22 December 1989, Ceau\u0219escu's personal pilot, Lt. Col. Vasile Malu\u021ban, received instructions from Lt. Gen. Opruta to proceed to Palace Square to pick up the president. As he flew over Palace Square he saw it was impossible to land there. Malu\u021ban landed his white [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Dauphin]], #203, on the terrace at 11:44. A man brandishing a white net curtain from one of the windows waved him down.<ref name=\"GG & WB\">[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceau\u0219escus and the Romanian Revolution'', pp. 168\u201369.

Then the Ceau\u0219escus came out, both practically carried by their bodyguards . . . They looked as if they were fainting. They were white with terror. [[Manea M\u0103nescu]] [one of the vice-presidents] and Emil Bobu were running behind them. M\u0103nescu, Bobu, Neagoe and another Securitate officer scrambled to the four seats in the back . . . As I pulled Ceau\u0219escu in, I saw the demonstrators running across the terrace . . . There wasn't enough space, Elena Ceau\u0219escu and I were squeezed in between the chairs and the door . . . We were only supposed to carry four passengers . . . We had six.\"<ref name=\"GG & WB\" />\n\nAccording to Malu\u021ban, it was 12:08 when they left for [[Snagov]]. After they arrived there, Ceau\u0219escu took Malu\u021ban into the presidential suite and ordered him to get two helicopters filled with soldiers for an armed guard, and a further Dauphin to come to Snagov. Malu\u021ban's unit commander replied on the phone, \"There has been a revolution . . . You are on your own . . . Good luck!\". Malu\u021ban then said to Ceau\u0219escu that the second motor was now warmed up and they needed to leave soon but he could only take four people, not six. M\u0103nescu and Bobu stayed behind. Ceau\u0219escu ordered Malu\u021ban to head for [[Titu]]. Near Titu, Malu\u021ban says that he made the helicopter dip up and down. He lied to Ceau\u0219escu, saying that this was to avoid anti-aircraft fire, since they would now be in range. Ceau\u0219escu panicked and told him to land.<ref>[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceau\u0219escus and the Romanian Revolution'', p. 170</ref>\n\nHe did so in a field next to the old road that led to [[Pite\u0219ti]]. Malu\u021ban then told his four passengers that he could do nothing more. The Securitate men ran to the roadside and began to flag down passing cars. Two cars stopped, one of them driven by a forestry official and one a red [[Automobile Dacia|Dacia]] driven by a local doctor. However, the doctor was not happy about getting involved and, after a short time driving the Ceau\u0219escus, faked engine trouble. A car of a bicycle repair man was then flagged down and he took them to [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]]. The driver of the car, Nicolae Petri\u0219or, convinced them that they could hide successfully in an agricultural technical institute on the edge of town. When they arrived, the director guided the Ceau\u0219escus into a room and then locked them in. They were arrested by local police at about 15:30, then after some wandering around transported to the T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te garrison's military compound and held captive for several days until their trial.<ref>[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceau\u0219escus and the Romanian Revolution'', p. 171</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Trial and execution===\n{{One source|date=September 2019}}{{Main|Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceau\u0219escu}}\nOn 24 December Ion Iliescu, head of the newly formed Council of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN), signed a decree establishing the Extraordinary Military Tribunal, a [[drumhead court-martial]] to try the Ceau\u0219escus for genocide and other crimes. The trial was held on 25 December, lasted for about two hours and delivered death sentences to the couple. Although nominally the Ceau\u0219escus had a right of appeal, their execution followed immediately, just outside the improvised courtroom, being carried out by three paratroopers with their service rifles.\n\nFootage of the trial and of the executed Ceau\u0219escus was promptly released in Romania and to the rest of the world. The actual moment of execution was not filmed since the cameraman was too slow, and he managed to get into the courtyard just as the shooting ended.<ref>[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceau\u0219escus and the Romanian Revolution'', p. 199</ref>\n\nIn footage of the trial, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu is seen answering the [[ad hoc]] tribunal judging him and referring to some of its members\u2014among them Army Gen. Victor Atanasie St\u0103nculescu and future Romanian Secret Service head [[Virgil M\u0103gureanu]]\u2014as \"traitors\". In this same video Ceau\u0219escu dismisses the \"tribunal\" as illegitimate and demands his constitutional rights to answer to charges in front of a legitimate tribunal.\n\n==New government==\n{{Main|National Salvation Front (Romania)|List of members of the National Salvation Front Council}}\n[[File:1989 Iliescu television.jpg|thumb|[[Ion Iliescu]] at the Romanian Television during the Romanian Revolution of 1989]]\n\nAfter Ceau\u0219escu left, the crowds in Palace Square entered a celebratory mood, perhaps even more intense than in the other former Eastern Bloc countries because of the recent violence. People cried, shouted and gave each other gifts mainly because it was also close to [[Christmas Day]], which was a long suppressed holiday in Romania. The occupation of the Central Committee building continued.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPeople threw Ceau\u0219escu's writings, official portraits and propaganda books out the windows, intending to burn them. They also promptly ripped off the giant letters from the roof making up the word ''\"comunist\"'' (\"communist\") in the slogan: \"Tr\u0103iasc\u0103 Partidul Comunist Rom\u00e2n!\" (\"Long live the Communist Party of Romania!\"). A young woman appeared on the rooftop and waved a flag with the coat of arms torn out.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt that time fierce fights were underway at [[Henri Coand\u0103 International Airport|Bucharest Otopeni International Airport]] between troops sent against each other under claims that they were going to confront terrorists. Early in the morning troops sent to reinforce the airport were fired upon.<ref name=adevarul>[http://www.adevarul.ro/life/dupa_20_de_ani/Crimele_Revolutiei-_Masacrul_de_la_Otopeni_0_171583443.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310202711/http://www.adevarul.ro/life/dupa_20_de_ani/Crimele_Revolutiei-_Masacrul_de_la_Otopeni_0_171583443.html |date=10 March 2012 }}</ref> These troops were from the UM 0865 Campina military base, and were summoned there by Gen.

Forces considered to be loyal to the old regime (spontaneously nicknamed \"terrorists\") opened fire on the crowd and attacked vital points of socio-political life: the television, radio and telephone buildings, as well as Casa Sc\u00e2nteii (the centre of the nation's print media, which serves a similar role today under the name [[Casa Presei Libere]], \"House of the Free Press\") and the post office in the district of [[Drumul Taberei]]; Palace Square (site of the Central Committee building, but also of the [[Central University Library of Bucharest|Central University Library]], the [[National Museum of Art of Romania|national art museum]] in the former Royal Palace, and the [[Romanian Athaeneum|Ateneul Rom\u00e2n]] (Romanian Athaeneum), Bucharest's leading concert hall); the university and the adjoining University Square (one of the city's main intersections); Otopeni and [[Aurel Vlaicu International Airport|B\u0103neasa]] airports; hospitals and the Ministry of Defence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the night of 22\u201323 December Bucharest residents remained on the streets, especially in the attacked zones, fighting (and ultimately winning, even at the cost of many lives) a battle with an elusive and dangerous enemy. With the military confused by contradictory orders, true battles ensued with many real casualties. At 21:00 on 23 December, tanks and a few paramilitary units arrived to protect the Palace of the Republic.<ref name=\":0\" />\nMeanwhile, messages of support were flooding in from all over the world: [[France]] ([[President of the French Republic|President]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]); the Soviet Union (General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev); [[Hungary]] (the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]]); the new [[East Germany|East German]] government (at that time the two German states were not yet formally reunited); [[Bulgaria]] ([[Petar Mladenov]], General Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Bulgaria]]); [[Czechoslovakia]] ([[Ladislav Adamec]], leader of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], and [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], the dissident writer, revolution leader and future president of the Republic); China (the Minister of Foreign Affairs); the [[United States]] ([[United States President|President]] [[George H.W.

Large quantities of food, medicine, clothing, medical equipment, and other [[humanitarian aid]] were sent to Romania. Around the world, the press dedicated entire pages and sometimes even complete issues to the Romanian revolution and its leaders.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 24 December Bucharest was a city at war. Tanks, APCs and trucks continued to patrol the city and surround trouble spots in order to protect them. At intersections near strategic objectives, roadblocks were built; automatic gunfire continued in and around University Square, the [[Bucharest North Railway Station|Gara de Nord]] (the city's main railroad station) and Palace Square. Yet amid the chaos, some people were seen clutching makeshift [[Christmas trees]]. \"Terrorist activities\" continued until 27 December, when they abruptly stopped. Nobody ever found out who conducted them, or who ordered their termination.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Casualties==\n\nThe total number of deaths in the Romanian Revolution was 1,104, of which 162 were in the protests that led to the overthrow of Ceau\u0219escu (16\u201322 December 1989) and 942 in the fighting that occurred after the seizure of power by the new FSN. The number of wounded was 3,352, of which 1,107 occurred while Ceau\u0219escu was still in power and 2,245 after the FSN took power.<ref name=\"Timi\u0219oara\">[http://timisoara.com/timisoara/revoluti.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619080849/http://timisoara.com/timisoara/revoluti.htm |date=19 June 2006 }}</ref><ref name = \"Mioc\">Marius Mioc, ''Revolu\u021bia din Timi\u0219oara a\u0219a cum fost'', 1997.</ref> Official figures place the death toll of the revolution at 689 people, many of whom were civilians.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">2014 [[Europa World Year Book]], pg. 3758,  {{ISBN|978-1857437140}}</ref>\n\n===Burning of the Central University Library===\nThe Central University Library was burned down in uncertain circumstances and over 500,000 books, along with about 3,700 manuscripts, were destroyed.<ref name = \"BCU\">[http://www.bcub.ro/home/istoric The Central University Library of Bucharest], official site: \"the History\".</ref><ref name=\"EVZ\">[http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/legea-recunostintei-made-in-romania-agentii-represiunii-ceausiste-au-ajuns-luptatori-remarca.html \"Legea recuno\u015ftin\u0163ei, made in Romania\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226204052/http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/legea-recunostintei-made-in-romania-agentii-represiunii-ceausiste-au-ajuns-luptatori-remarca.html |date=26 December 2013 }}, [[Evenimentul Zilei]], 3 June 2010.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{outdated section|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Political changes===\nThe Revolution brought Romania vast attention from the outside world. Initially, much of the world's sympathy went to the FSN government under Ion Iliescu, a former member of the CPR leadership and a Ceau\u0219escu ally prior to falling into the dictator's disfavour in the early 1980s. The FSN, composed mainly of former members of the second echelon of the CPR, immediately assumed control over the state institutions, including the main media outlets such as the national radio and television networks. They used their control of the media in order to launch attacks against their political opponents, newly created political parties that claimed to be successors to those existing before 1948.\n\nMuch of that sympathy was squandered during the [[Mineriad]]. Massive protests erupted in downtown Bucharest as political rallies organised by the opposition parties during the presidential elections, with a small part of the protesters deciding to stand ground even after Iliescu was re-elected with an overwhelming majority of 85%. Attempts by police to evacuate the remaining protesters resulted in attacks on state institutions, prompting Iliescu to appeal to the country's workers for help. Infiltrated and instigated by former [[Securitate]] agents, in the following days a large mass of workers, mainly miners, entered Bucharest and attacked and fought with anti-government protesters and gathered bystanders.<ref name=\"Baleanu\">[http://www.fas.org/irp/world/romania/g43.html  Baleanu, V.

He stated that [[Ion Iliescu]] made a \"monumental\" mistake in \"conceding to the crowd\" and banning the PCR.<ref name=\"notagainst\">\"Romania revolution 'not against communism'\", ''Guardian'', 19 May 1990, Page 24</ref>\n\nWhile other former ruling Communist parties in the Soviet bloc reconfigured themselves into social democratic or democratic socialist parties, the PCR melted away in the wake of the revolution, never to return. However, a number of former PCR politicians remain prominent on Romania's political scene. Iliescu, for example, remained the central figure in Romanian politics for more than a decade, losing the presidency in 1996 before regaining it in 2000; he retired for good in 2004.\n\n===Economic reforms===\nThe FSN chose between the two economic models that political elites claimed were available to post-Communist Eastern European countries: [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] or gradual reforms. The FSN chose the latter, slower reforms, because it would have not been possible to convince the people who were already \"exhausted\" after Ceau\u0219escu's austerity to undergo further sacrifices.<ref>Roper, pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] reforms were implemented, although not all at once: by the end of 1990, the prices were liberalised and a free currency exchange rate, devaluing the leu by 60%. The land of the state-owned collective farms was distributed to private owners<ref>Roper, pp. 89\u201390.</ref> and a list of 708 large state-owned enterprises to be privatised was devised.<ref>Roper, p. 95.</ref>\n\nIn 1991 Romania signed an agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and began the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, with the first [[privatisation]] law being passed in 1991.<ref>Roper, p. 91.</ref> In 1992, the [[Stolojan I Cabinet|Stolojan government]] began an austerity plan, limiting wages and further liberalising prices.

Ceau\u0219escu|Elena]], and the end of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|42 years of Communist rule]] in Romania. It was also the last removal of a [[Marxist-Leninist government]] in a [[Warsaw Pact]] country during the events of 1989, and the only one that violently overthrew a country's government and executed its leader.\n\nEarly protests occurred in the city of Timi\u0219oara in mid-December on the part of the [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian minority]] in response to an attempt by the government to evict [[Magyars|Hungarian]] [[Reformed churches|Reformed church]] pastor [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s]]. In response, Romanians sought revolution and a change in government in light of similar recent events in neighbouring nations. The country's ubiquitous [[secret police]] force, the [[Securitate]], which was both one of the largest in the [[Eastern Bloc]] and for decades had been the main suppressor of popular dissent, frequently and violently quashing political disagreement, ultimately proved incapable of stopping the looming, and then highly fatal and successful revolt.<ref>{{cite web |first=Craig S.|last=Smith |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/world/europe/12spooks.html?_r=2& |title=Eastern Europe Struggles to Purge Security Services \u2013 The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2016-12-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226235751/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/world/europe/12spooks.html?_r=2& |archivedate=26 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ceausescu.org/ceausescu_texts/revolution/december_revolt_roleofsec.htm |title=The December Revolt and the Coup D'Etat \u2013 1989: Role Of The Securitate In The December Revolt And Coup |publisher=Ceausescu.org |date=1989-12-22 |accessdate=2016-12-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008022130/http://www.ceausescu.org/ceausescu_texts/revolution/december_revolt_roleofsec.htm |archivedate=8 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSocial and economic malaise had been present in socialist Romania for quite some time, especially during the austerity years of the 1980s.

To achieve this, many basic goods\u2014including gas, heat and food\u2014were rationed, which drastically reduced the [[standard of living]] and increased [[malnutrition]]. The [[infant mortality]] rate also grew to be the highest in Europe.<ref>Roper, pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nThe [[secret police]], ''[[Securitate]]'', had become so omnipresent that it made Romania essentially a [[police state]]. [[Free speech]] was limited and opinions that did not favour the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) were forbidden. The large numbers of Securitate informers made [[Dissent in Romania under Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu|organized dissent]] nearly impossible. The regime deliberately played on this sense that everyone was being watched to make it easier to bend the people to the Party's will.<ref name= Revolution1989 /> Even by [[Eastern Bloc politics#Secret police|Soviet Bloc standards]], the Securitate was exceptionally brutal.<ref name = \"smith\">{{Citation | first = Craig S | last = Smith | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/world/europe/12spooks.html | title = Eastern Europe Struggles to purge Security Services | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 12 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nCeau\u0219escu created a [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's cult of personality|cult of personality]], with weekly shows in stadiums or on streets in different cities dedicated to him, his wife and the Communist Party.

These and similar projects drained the country's finances and aggravated the already dire economic situation. Thousands of Bucharest residents were evicted from their homes, which were subsequently demolished to make room for the huge structures.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lake |first=Quintin |url=http://blog.quintinlake.com/2011/12/12/photos-ceausescus-palace-of-the-parliament-bucharest/ |title=Photos: Ceausescu's Palace of the Parliament, Bucharest &#124; Geometry & Silence |publisher=Blog.quintinlake.com |date=2011-12-12 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the other [[Warsaw Pact]] leaders, Ceau\u0219escu had not been slavishly pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] but rather had pursued an \"independent\" foreign policy; Romanian forces did not join their Warsaw Pact allies in putting an end to the [[Prague Spring]]\u2014an [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion]] Ceau\u0219escu [[Ceau\u0219escu's speech of 21 August 1968|openly denounced]]\u2014while [[Romania at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Romanian athletes]] competed at the Soviet-boycotted [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles (receiving a standing ovation at the opening ceremonies and proceeding to win 53 medals, trailing only the US and [[West Germany]] in the overall count).<ref name = lat_ovation>{{cite web|last=Mitchell| first = Houston |title = L.A.'s greatest sports moments No. 3: 1984 Olympics opening|url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2011/12/las-greatest-sports-moments-no-3-the-1984-olympics-opening-ceremony.html |work= The Los Angeles Times| date =9 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=medal_tab>{{cite web|title=1984 Los Angeles Summer Games|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1984/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707092752/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1984/|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 July 2008|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref> Conversely, while [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] spoke of reform, Ceau\u0219escu maintained a hard political line and cult of personality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/items/show/692 |title=Minutes of the Meeting between Nicolae Ceausescu and Mikhail Gorbachev, December 1989 &#124; Making the History of 1989 |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date=1990-01-09 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe austerity programme started in 1981 and the widespread poverty it introduced made the Communist regime very unpopular. The austerity programmes were met with little resistance among Romanians and there were only a few strikes and labour disputes, of which the [[Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977]] and the [[Bra\u0219ov Rebellion]] of November 1987 at the truck manufacturer [[Roman (vehicle manufacturer)|Steagul Ro\u0219u]] were the most notable. In March 1989, several leading activists of the PCR criticised Ceau\u0219escu's economic policies in a [[Letter of the Six|letter]], but shortly thereafter he achieved a significant political victory: Romania paid off its external debt of about US$11 billion several months before the time that even the Romanian dictator expected. However, in the months following the austerity program, shortages of goods remained the same as before.\n \nLike the [[Neues Deutschland|East German state newspaper]], official Romanian news organs made no mention of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in the first days following 9 November 1989.  The most notable news in Romanian newspapers of 11 November 1989, was the \"masterly lecture by comrade Nicolae Ceausescu at the extended plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Romania,\" in which the Romanian head of state and party highly praised the \"brilliant program for the work and revolutionary struggle of all our people,\" as well as the \"exemplary fulfillment of economic tasks.\" What had happened 1,500 km northwest of Bucharest, in divided Berlin, during those days is not even mentioned. Socialism is praised as the \"way of the free, independent development of the peoples.\"  The same day, on Bucharest's Brezoianu Street and Kog\u0103lniceanu Boulevard, a group of students from [[Cluj-Napoca]] attempted a demonstration but were quickly apprehended. It initially appeared that Ceau\u0219escu would weather the wave of revolution sweeping across Eastern Europe, as he was formally re-elected for another five-year term as [[General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party]] on 24 November at the party's XIV Congress. On that same day, Ceau\u0219escu's counterpart in [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]], [[Milo\u0161 Jake\u0161]], resigned along with the entire Communist leadership, effectively [[Velvet Revolution|ending Communist rule in Czechoslovakia]].  \n\nThe three students, Mihnea Paraschivescu, Gra\u021bian Vulpe, and the economist Dan C\u0103prariu-Schlachter from Cluj, were detained and investigated by the Securitate at the Rahova Penitentiary on suspicion of propaganda against the socialist society. They were released on 22 December 1989 at 14:00. There were other letters and attempts to draw attention to the economic, cultural, and spiritual oppression of Romanians, but they served only to intensify the activity of the police and Securitate. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Timi\u0219oara uprising==\n[[File:1989 December 16. sug\u00e1r\u00fat \u00e9s a Tudor Vladimirescu \u00fat keresztez\u0151d\u00e9se.

For some time his parishioners gathered around his home to protect him from harassment and eviction. Many passersby spontaneously joined in. As it became clear that the crowd would not disperse, the mayor, Petre Mo\u021b, made remarks suggesting that he had overturned the decision to evict T\u0151k\u00e9s. Meanwhile, the crowd had grown impatient and, when Mo\u021b declined to confirm his statement against the planned eviction in writing, the crowd started to chant anti-communist slogans. Subsequently, police and ''Securitate'' forces showed up at the scene. By 19:30 the protest had spread and the original cause became largely irrelevant.\n\nSome of the protesters attempted to burn down the building that housed the district committee of the PCR. The ''Securitate'' responded with [[tear gas]] and water jets, while police beat up rioters and arrested many of them. Around 21:00 the rioters withdrew. They regrouped eventually around the [[Timi\u0219oara Orthodox Cathedral|Romanian Orthodox Cathedral]] and started a protest march around the city, but again they were confronted by the security forces.\n\n===Crackdown===\n{{One source\n| date = September 2019\n}}[[File:Romania, Transylvania, Timisoara Fortepan 31879.jpg|thumb|People detained after 22 December 1989 in Timi\u015foara]]\n\nRiots and protests resumed the following day, 17 December.

The presence of the army in the streets was an ominous one: It meant that they had received their orders from the highest level of the command chain, presumably from Ceau\u0219escu himself. The army failed to establish order and chaos ensued, including gunfire, fights, casualties, and burned cars.

Tanks, trucks and TABs blocked the accesses into the city while helicopters hovered overhead. After midnight the protests calmed down. Colonel-General Ion Coman, local Party secretary Ilie Matei, and Colonel-General [[\u0218tefan Gu\u0219\u0103]] ([[Chief of the Romanian General Staff]]) inspected the city.

Expecting that they would be fired upon, they started to sing \"[[De\u0219teapt\u0103-te, rom\u00e2ne!]]\" (''\"Awaken thee, Romanian!\"''), an earlier patriotic song that had been banned since 1947.

About 100,000 protesters occupied Pia\u021ba Operei (Opera Square \u2013 today Pia\u021ba Victoriei, Victory Square) and chanted anti-government slogans: ''\"Noi suntem poporul!\"'' (\"We are the people!\"), ''\"Armata e cu noi!\"'' (\"The army is on our side!\"), ''\"Nu v\u0103 fie fric\u0103, Ceau\u0219escu pic\u0103!\"'' (\"Have no fear, Ceau\u0219escu is falling!\")<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMeanwhile, [[Emil Bobu]] (Secretary to the Central Committee) and Prime Minister [[Constantin D\u0103sc\u0103lescu]] were sent by Elena Ceau\u0219escu (Nicolae being at that time in [[Iran]]) to resolve the situation. They met with a delegation of the protesters and agreed to free the majority of the arrested protesters. However, they refused to comply with the protesters' main demand (resignation of Ceau\u0219escu) and the situation remained essentially unchanged.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe next day, trains loaded with workers from factories in [[Oltenia]] arrived in Timi\u0219oara. The regime was attempting to use them to repress the mass protests, but after a brief encounter they ended up joining the protests. One worker explained, \"Yesterday our factory boss and a party official rounded us up in the yard, handed us wooden clubs and told us that Hungarians and 'hooligans' were devastating Timi\u0219oara and that it is our duty to go there and help crush the riots. But I realised that wasn't the truth.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 18 December, Ceau\u0219escu had departed for a visit to Iran, leaving the duty of crushing the Timi\u0219oara revolt to his subordinates and his wife. Upon his return on the evening of 20 December, the situation became even more tense, and he gave a televised speech from the TV studio inside the Central Committee Building (CC Building) in which he spoke about the events at Timi\u0219oara in terms of an \"interference of foreign forces in Romania's internal affairs\" and an \"external aggression on Romania's sovereignty.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe country, which had no information about the Timi\u0219oara events from the national media, heard about the Timi\u0219oara revolt from Western radio stations like [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe]], and by word of mouth. A mass meeting was staged for the next day, 21 December, which, according to the official media, was presented as a \"spontaneous movement of support for Ceau\u0219escu,\" emulating the 1968 meeting in which Ceau\u0219escu had spoken against the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Revolution spreads==\n===Ceau\u0219escu's speech===\nOn the morning of 21 December, Ceau\u0219escu addressed an assembly of approximately 100,000 people to condemn the uprising in Timi\u0219oara. Party officials took great pains to make it appear that Ceau\u0219escu was still immensely popular. Several busloads of workers, under threat of being fired, arrived in Bucharest's Pia\u021ba Palatului (Palace Square, now [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Pia\u021ba Revolu\u021biei]] \u2013 Revolution Square) and were given red flags, banners and large pictures of Ceau\u0219escu. They were augmented by bystanders who were rounded up on Calea Victoriei.<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Revolutie Bucuresti1.JPG|thumb|left|The balcony where Ceau\u0219escu delivered his last speech, taken over by the crowd during the Romanian Revolution of 1989]]\n\nThe speech was typical of most of Ceau\u0219escu's speeches over the years. Making liberal use of Marxist-Leninist rhetoric, he delivered a litany of the achievements of the \"socialist revolution\" and Romanian \"multi-laterally developed socialist society\". He blamed the Timi\u0219oara uprising on \"fascist agitators\". However, Ceau\u0219escu was out of touch with his people and completely misread the crowd's mood. The people remained unresponsive, and only the front rows supported Ceau\u0219escu with cheers and applause. About two minutes into the speech, some in the crowd actually began to jeer, boo, whistle and yell insults at him, a reaction unthinkable for most of his rule. Workers from a Bucharest power plant started chanting \"Ti-mi-\u0219oa-ra! Ti-mi-\u0219oa-ra!\", which was soon picked up by others in the crowd. In response, Ceau\u0219escu raised his right hand in hopes of silencing the crowd; his stunned expression remains one of the defining moments of the end of Communism in Eastern Europe. He then tried to placate the crowd by offering to raise workers' salaries by 200 [[Romanian leu|lei]] per month (about 19 [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] at the time, yet a 5%\u201310% raise for a modest salary) and student scholarships from 100 to 110 lei while continuing to praise the achievements of the Socialist Revolution. However, a revolution was brewing right in front of his eyes.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nAs Ceau\u0219escu was addressing the crowd from the balcony of the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Central Committee building]], sudden movement came from the outskirts of the massed assembly, as did the sound of (what various sources have reported as) fireworks, bombs or guns, which together caused the assembly to break into chaos. Initially frightened, the crowds tried to disperse. [[Bullhorn]]s then began to spread the news that the Securitate was firing on the crowd and that a \"revolution\" was unfolding. This persuaded people in the assembly to join in. The rally turned into a protest demonstration.\n\n[[File:PozeRevolutia1989clujByRazvanRotta13.jpg|thumb|Protesters in [[Cluj-Napoca]] on the morning of 21 December. This photo was taken by R\u0103zvan Rotta after security forces opened fire.]]\n\nThe entire speech was being broadcast live nationwide. Censors attempted to cut the live video feed and replace it with Communist propaganda songs and video praising the Ceau\u0219escu regime, but parts of the riots had already been broadcast and most of the Romanian people realised that something unusual was in progress. Ceau\u0219escu and his wife, as well as other officials and CPEx members, panicked; Ceau\u0219escu's bodyguard hustled him back inside the building.\n\nThe jeers and whistles soon erupted into a riot; the crowd took to the streets, placing the capital, like Timi\u0219oara, in turmoil. Members of the crowd spontaneously began shouting anti-Ceau\u0219escu slogans, which spread and became chants: ''\"Jos dictatorul!\"'' (\"Down with the dictator\"), ''\"Moarte criminalului!\"'' (\"Death to the criminal\"), ''\"Noi suntem poporul, jos cu dictatorul!\"'' (\"We are the People, down with the dictator\"), ''\"Ceau\u0219escu cine e\u0219ti?/Criminal din Scornice\u0219ti\"'' (\"Ceau\u0219escu, who are you?  A criminal from [[Scornice\u0219ti]]\").<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nProtesters eventually flooded the city centre area, from Pia\u021ba Kog\u0103lniceanu to [[Pia\u021ba Unirii]], [[Pia\u021ba Rosetti]] and [[Pia\u021ba Roman\u0103]]. In one notable scene from the event, a young man waved a [[History of the flags of Romania#Flag of the Romanian Revolution of 1989|tricolour]] with the Communist coat of arms torn out of its centre while perched on the statue of [[Mihai Viteazul]] on Boulevard Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu in the [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]]. Many others began to emulate the young protester, and the waving and displaying of the Romanian flag with the Communist insignia cut out quickly became widespread.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Street confrontations===\n{{One source|date=September 2019}}\nAs the hours passed many more people took to the streets. Later, observers claimed that even at this point, had Ceau\u0219escu been willing to talk, he might have been able to salvage something. Instead, he decided on force.<ref name=Revolution1989/>  Soon the protesters\u2014unarmed and unorganised\u2014were confronted by soldiers, tanks, APCs, [[Brigada Antiterorist\u0103|USLA]] troops (''Unitatea Special\u0103 pentru Lupta Antiterorist\u0103'', anti-terrorist special squads) and armed plainclothes ''Securitate'' officers. The crowd was soon being shot at from various buildings, side streets and tanks.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere were many casualties, including deaths, as victims were shot, clubbed to death, stabbed and crushed by armoured vehicles. One APC drove into the crowd around the [[InterContinental Bucharest|InterContinental Hotel]], crushing people. A French journalist, Jean-Louis Calderon, was killed. A street near University Square was later named after him, as well as a high school in Timi\u0219oara. Belgian journalist [[Danny Huw\u00e9]] was shot and killed on 23 or 24 December 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newseum.org/scripts/Journalist/Detail.asp?PhotoID=50 |title=Details for HUWE, DANNY |publisher=Newseum.org |accessdate=2012-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302223000/http://www.newseum.org/scripts/Journalist/Detail.asp?PhotoID=50 |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=APPublished: 26 December 1989 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/26/world/upheaval-in-the-east-2-journalists-killed-in-rumanian-combat.html?pagewanted=1 |title=UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST; 2 Journalists Killed in Rumanian Combat \u2013 New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-12-26 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://enciclopediaromaniei.ro/wiki/Danny_Huwe |title=Danny Huwe \u2013 Enciclopedia Rom\u00e2niei \u2013 prima enciclopedie online despre Rom\u00e2nia |language=ro |publisher=Enciclopediaromaniei.ro |date= |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ABI100 KingFerdinandMuseum.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|An [[ABI (armored vehicle)|ABI]] armoured car used by the [[Brigada Antiterorist\u0103|USLA]] in December 1989]]\n\nFirefighters hit the demonstrators with powerful water jets, and the police continued to beat and arrest people. Protesters managed to build a defensible barricade in front of the ''Dun\u0103rea'' (\"Danube\") restaurant, which stood until after midnight, but was finally torn apart by government forces. Intense shooting continued until after 03:00, by which time the survivors had fled the streets.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRecords of the fighting that day include footage shot from [[helicopter]]s that were sent to raid the area and record evidence for eventual reprisals, as well as by tourists in the high tower of the centrally located InterContinental Hotel, next to the [[Romanian National Theater|National Theatre]] and across the street from the university.\n\nIt is likely that in the early hours of 22 December the Ceau\u0219escus made their second mistake. Instead of fleeing the city under cover of night, they decided to wait until morning to leave. Ceau\u0219escu must have thought that his desperate attempts to crush the protests had succeeded, because he apparently called another meeting for the next morning. However, before 07:00, his wife Elena received the news that large columns of workers from many industrial platforms (large communist-era factories or groups of factories concentrated into industrial zones) were heading towards the city centre of Bucharest to join the protests. The police barricades that were meant to block access to Pia\u021ba Universit\u0103\u021bii (University Square) and Palace Square proved useless. By 09:30 University Square was jammed with protesters. Security forces (army, police and others) re-entered the area, only to join with the protesters.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy 10:00, as the radio broadcast was announcing the introduction of martial law and a ban on groups larger than five persons, hundreds of thousands of people were gathering for the first time, spontaneously, in central Bucharest (the previous day's crowd had come together at Ceau\u0219escu's orders). Ceau\u0219escu attempted to address the crowd from the balcony of the Central Committee of the Communist Party building, but his attempt was met with a wave of disapproval and anger. Helicopters spread manifestos (which did not reach the crowd, due to unfavourable winds) instructing people not to fall victim to the latest \"diversion attempts,\" but to go home instead and enjoy the Christmas feast. This order, which drew unfavourable comparisons to [[Marie Antoinette]]'s haughty (but apocryphal) \"[[Let them eat cake]]\", further infuriated the people who did read the manifestos; many at that time had trouble procuring basic foodstuffs such as cooking oil.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Military defection and Ceau\u0219escu's fall==\nAt approximately 09:30 on the morning of 22 December [[Vasile Milea]], Ceau\u0219escu's minister of defence, died under suspicious circumstances. A communiqu\u00e9 by Ceau\u0219escu stated that Milea had been sacked for treason, and that he had committed suicide after his treason was revealed.<ref name=\":0\" /> The most widespread opinion at the time was that Milea hesitated to follow Ceau\u0219escu's orders to fire on the demonstrators, even though tanks had been dispatched to downtown Bucharest that morning.  Milea was already in severe disfavour with Ceau\u0219escu for initially sending soldiers to Timi\u0219oara without live [[ammunition]]. Rank-and-file soldiers believed that Milea had actually been murdered and went over virtually ''en masse'' to the revolution. Senior commanders wrote off Ceau\u0219escu as a lost cause and made no effort to keep their men loyal to the regime. This effectively ended any chance of Ceau\u0219escu staying in power.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nAccounts differ about how Milea died. His family and several junior officers believed he had been shot in his own office by the Securitate, while another group of officers believed he had committed suicide.<ref name=Revolution1989/>  In 2005 an investigation concluded that the minister killed himself by shooting at his heart, but the bullet missed the heart, hit a nearby artery and led to his death shortly afterward.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nUpon learning of Milea's death, Ceau\u0219escu appointed [[Victor St\u0103nculescu]] minister of defence. He accepted after a brief hesitation. St\u0103nculescu, however, ordered the troops back to their quarters without Ceau\u0219escu's knowledge, and also persuaded Ceau\u0219escu to leave by helicopter, thus making the dictator a fugitive. At that same moment angry protesters began storming the Communist Party headquarters; St\u0103nculescu and the soldiers under his command did not oppose them.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy refusing to carry out Ceau\u0219escu's orders (he was still technically commander-in-chief of the army), St\u0103nculescu played a central role in the overthrow of the dictatorship. \"I had the prospect of two execution squads: Ceau\u0219escu's and the revolutionary one!\" confessed St\u0103nculescu later. In the afternoon, St\u0103nculescu \"chose\" [[Ion Iliescu]]'s political group from among others that were striving for power in the aftermath of the recent events.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Helicopter extraction===\nFollowing Ceau\u0219escu's second failed attempt to address the crowd, he and Elena fled into a lift headed for the roof. A group of protesters managed to force their way into the building, overpower Ceau\u0219escu's bodyguards and make their way through his office before heading onto the balcony. They didn't know it, but they were only a few metres from Ceau\u0219escu. The lift's electricity failed just before it reached the top floor, and Ceau\u0219escu's bodyguards forced it open and ushered the couple onto the roof.<ref name = Revolution1989 />\n\nAt 11:20 on 22 December 1989, Ceau\u0219escu's personal pilot, Lt. Col. Vasile Malu\u021ban, received instructions from Lt. Gen. Opruta to proceed to Palace Square to pick up the president. As he flew over Palace Square he saw it was impossible to land there. Malu\u021ban landed his white [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Dauphin]], #203, on the terrace at 11:44. A man brandishing a white net curtain from one of the windows waved him down.<ref name=\"GG & WB\">[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceau\u0219escus and the Romanian Revolution'', pp. 168\u201369. Futura Publications, 1991</ref>\n\nMalu\u021ban said, \"Then Stelica, the co-pilot, came to me and said that there were demonstrators coming to the terrace. Then the Ceau\u0219escus came out, both practically carried by their bodyguards . . . They looked as if they were fainting. They were white with terror. [[Manea M\u0103nescu]] [one of the vice-presidents] and Emil Bobu were running behind them. M\u0103nescu, Bobu, Neagoe and another Securitate officer scrambled to the four seats in the back . . . As I pulled Ceau\u0219escu in, I saw the demonstrators running across the terrace . . . There wasn't enough space, Elena Ceau\u0219escu and I were squeezed in between the chairs and the door . . . We were only supposed to carry four passengers . . . We had six.\"<ref name=\"GG & WB\" />\n\nAccording to Malu\u021ban, it was 12:08 when they left for [[Snagov]]. After they arrived there, Ceau\u0219escu took Malu\u021ban into the presidential suite and ordered him to get two helicopters filled with soldiers for an armed guard, and a further Dauphin to come to Snagov. Malu\u021ban's unit commander replied on the phone, \"There has been a revolution . . . You are on your own . . . Good luck!\". Malu\u021ban then said to Ceau\u0219escu that the second motor was now warmed up and they needed to leave soon but he could only take four people, not six. M\u0103nescu and Bobu stayed behind. Ceau\u0219escu ordered Malu\u021ban to head for [[Titu]]. Near Titu, Malu\u021ban says that he made the helicopter dip up and down. He lied to Ceau\u0219escu, saying that this was to avoid anti-aircraft fire, since they would now be in range. Ceau\u0219escu panicked and told him to land.<ref>[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceau\u0219escus and the Romanian Revolution'', p. 170</ref>\n\nHe did so in a field next to the old road that led to [[Pite\u0219ti]]. Malu\u021ban then told his four passengers that he could do nothing more. The Securitate men ran to the roadside and began to flag down passing cars. Two cars stopped, one of them driven by a forestry official and one a red [[Automobile Dacia|Dacia]] driven by a local doctor. However, the doctor was not happy about getting involved and, after a short time driving the Ceau\u0219escus, faked engine trouble. A car of a bicycle repair man was then flagged down and he took them to [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]]. The driver of the car, Nicolae Petri\u0219or, convinced them that they could hide successfully in an agricultural technical institute on the edge of town. When they arrived, the director guided the Ceau\u0219escus into a room and then locked them in. They were arrested by local police at about 15:30, then after some wandering around transported to the T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te garrison's military compound and held captive for several days until their trial.<ref>[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceau\u0219escus and the Romanian Revolution'', p. 171</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Trial and execution===\n{{One source|date=September 2019}}{{Main|Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceau\u0219escu}}\nOn 24 December Ion Iliescu, head of the newly formed Council of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN), signed a decree establishing the Extraordinary Military Tribunal, a [[drumhead court-martial]] to try the Ceau\u0219escus for genocide and other crimes. The trial was held on 25 December, lasted for about two hours and delivered death sentences to the couple. Although nominally the Ceau\u0219escus had a right of appeal, their execution followed immediately, just outside the improvised courtroom, being carried out by three paratroopers with their service rifles.\n\nFootage of the trial and of the executed Ceau\u0219escus was promptly released in Romania and to the rest of the world. The actual moment of execution was not filmed since the cameraman was too slow, and he managed to get into the courtyard just as the shooting ended.<ref>[[George Galloway]] and Bob Wylie, ''Downfall: The Ceau\u0219escus and the Romanian Revolution'', p. 199</ref>\n\nIn footage of the trial, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu is seen answering the [[ad hoc]] tribunal judging him and referring to some of its members\u2014among them Army Gen. Victor Atanasie St\u0103nculescu and future Romanian Secret Service head [[Virgil M\u0103gureanu]]\u2014as \"traitors\". In this same video Ceau\u0219escu dismisses the \"tribunal\" as illegitimate and demands his constitutional rights to answer to charges in front of a legitimate tribunal.\n\n==New government==\n{{Main|National Salvation Front (Romania)|List of members of the National Salvation Front Council}}\n[[File:1989 Iliescu television.jpg|thumb|[[Ion Iliescu]] at the Romanian Television during the Romanian Revolution of 1989]]\n\nAfter Ceau\u0219escu left, the crowds in Palace Square entered a celebratory mood, perhaps even more intense than in the other former Eastern Bloc countries because of the recent violence. People cried, shouted and gave each other gifts mainly because it was also close to [[Christmas Day]], which was a long suppressed holiday in Romania. The occupation of the Central Committee building continued.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPeople threw Ceau\u0219escu's writings, official portraits and propaganda books out the windows, intending to burn them. They also promptly ripped off the giant letters from the roof making up the word ''\"comunist\"'' (\"communist\") in the slogan: \"Tr\u0103iasc\u0103 Partidul Comunist Rom\u00e2n!\" (\"Long live the Communist Party of Romania!\"). A young woman appeared on the rooftop and waved a flag with the coat of arms torn out.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt that time fierce fights were underway at [[Henri Coand\u0103 International Airport|Bucharest Otopeni International Airport]] between troops sent against each other under claims that they were going to confront terrorists.

Forces considered to be loyal to the old regime (spontaneously nicknamed \"terrorists\") opened fire on the crowd and attacked vital points of socio-political life: the television, radio and telephone buildings, as well as Casa Sc\u00e2nteii (the centre of the nation's print media, which serves a similar role today under the name [[Casa Presei Libere]], \"House of the Free Press\") and the post office in the district of [[Drumul Taberei]]; Palace Square (site of the Central Committee building, but also of the [[Central University Library of Bucharest|Central University Library]], the [[National Museum of Art of Romania|national art museum]] in the former Royal Palace, and the [[Romanian Athaeneum|Ateneul Rom\u00e2n]] (Romanian Athaeneum), Bucharest's leading concert hall); the university and the adjoining University Square (one of the city's main intersections); Otopeni and [[Aurel Vlaicu International Airport|B\u0103neasa]] airports; hospitals and the Ministry of Defence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the night of 22\u201323 December Bucharest residents remained on the streets, especially in the attacked zones, fighting (and ultimately winning, even at the cost of many lives) a battle with an elusive and dangerous enemy.

Tanks, APCs and trucks continued to patrol the city and surround trouble spots in order to protect them.

Initially, much of the world's sympathy went to the FSN government under Ion Iliescu, a former member of the CPR leadership and a Ceau\u0219escu ally prior to falling into the dictator's disfavour in the early 1980s. The FSN, composed mainly of former members of the second echelon of the CPR, immediately assumed control over the state institutions, including the main media outlets such as the national radio and television networks. They used their control of the media in order to launch attacks against their political opponents, newly created political parties that claimed to be successors to those existing before 1948.\n\nMuch of that sympathy was squandered during the [[Mineriad]]. Massive protests erupted in downtown Bucharest as political rallies organised by the opposition parties during the presidential elections, with a small part of the protesters deciding to stand ground even after Iliescu was re-elected with an overwhelming majority of 85%. Attempts by police to evacuate the remaining protesters resulted in attacks on state institutions, prompting Iliescu to appeal to the country's workers for help. Infiltrated and instigated by former [[Securitate]] agents, in the following days a large mass of workers, mainly miners, entered Bucharest and attacked and fought with anti-government protesters and gathered bystanders.<ref name=\"Baleanu\">[http://www.fas.org/irp/world/romania/g43.html  Baleanu, V.

He stated that [[Ion Iliescu]] made a \"monumental\" mistake in \"conceding to the crowd\" and banning the PCR.<ref name=\"notagainst\">\"Romania revolution 'not against communism'\", ''Guardian'', 19 May 1990, Page 24</ref>\n\nWhile other former ruling Communist parties in the Soviet bloc reconfigured themselves into social democratic or democratic socialist parties, the PCR melted away in the wake of the revolution, never to return. However, a number of former PCR politicians remain prominent on Romania's political scene. Iliescu, for example, remained the central figure in Romanian politics for more than a decade, losing the presidency in 1996 before regaining it in 2000; he retired for good in 2004.\n\n===Economic reforms===\nThe FSN chose between the two economic models that political elites claimed were available to post-Communist Eastern European countries: [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] or gradual reforms. The FSN chose the latter, slower reforms, because it would have not been possible to convince the people who were already \"exhausted\" after Ceau\u0219escu's austerity to undergo further sacrifices.<ref>Roper, pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] reforms were implemented, although not all at once: by the end of 1990, the prices were liberalised and a free currency exchange rate, devaluing the leu by 60%. The land of the state-owned collective farms was distributed to private owners<ref>Roper, pp. 89\u201390.</ref> and a list of 708 large state-owned enterprises to be privatised was devised.<ref>Roper, p. 95.</ref>\n\nIn 1991 Romania signed an agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and began the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, with the first [[privatisation]] law being passed in 1991.<ref>Roper, p. 91.</ref> In 1992, the [[Stolojan I Cabinet|Stolojan government]] began an austerity plan, limiting wages and further liberalising prices. The economic situation deteriorated and inflation as well as unemployment increased substantially.<ref>Roper, p. 93.</ref> The austerity measures, which by 1995 included a decrease in social spending, led to an increase in poverty.<ref>Roper, pp. 95\u201397.</ref>\n\nThe neoliberal reforms were accelerated after the Democratic Convention won the [[1996 Romanian general election|1996 elections]], the government using its prerogatives to pass a package of laws, removing subsidies, passing reforms on unemployment benefits and greatly increasing the number of privatised companies.<ref>Roper, p. 100.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Romanian AKM Soldier.JPEG|A Romanian [[sub-officer]] gives the [[victory sign]] on [[New Year's Eve]] 1989.

The first recorded professional tattoo artist in the US was a German immigrant, [[Martin Hildebrandt]]. He opened a shop in New York City in 1846 and quickly became popular during the [[American Civil War]] among soldiers and sailors of both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] militaries.\n\nHildebrandt began traveling from camp to camp to tattoo soldiers, increasing his popularity and also giving birth to the tradition of getting tattoos while being an American serviceman. Soon after the Civil War, tattoos became fashionable among upper-class young adults. This trend lasted until the beginning of World War I. The invention of the electric tattoo machine caused popularity of tattoos among the wealthy to drop off. The machine made the tattooing procedure both much easier and cheaper, thus, eliminating the status symbol tattoos previously held, as they were now affordable for all socioeconomic classes. The status symbol of a tattoo shifted from a representation of wealth to a mark typically seen on rebels and criminals. Despite this change, tattoos remained popular among military servicemen, a tradition that continues today.\n\nIn 1975, there were only 40 tattoo artists in the country; in 1980, there were more than 5,000 self-proclaimed tattoo artists, {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} appearing in response to booming popularity in the skin mural trade.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1980/11/09/original-tattoo-artist-times-changing/99616353-ba75-477d-822c-4aeaf062d17a/|title=Original Tattoo Artist: Times Changing|date=1980-11-09|work=Washington Post|access-date=2019-03-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\nMany studies have been done of the tattooed population and society's view of tattoos.

These were simple documents that described the sailor as being an American sailor. Many of the protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the [[Royal Navy]] paid no attention to them. In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.' <ref>[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1992/spring/seamans-protection.html \"Genealogical Fallout from the War of 1812.\"] By Ruth Priest Dixon. ''Prologue Magazine''. Spring 1992. Volume 24 (1).</ref> One way of making them more specific was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal, and thus use that description to identify the seaman. As a result, many of the later certificates carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as other specific information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen. Frequently their 'protection papers' made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.<ref>Smith, Gene Allan. 2013. ''The Slave's Gamble''. MacMillan. Page 55.</ref>\n\nIn the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tattoos were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the protection papers issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-[[passport]]s catalogued tattoos alongside [[birthmark]]s, [[scar]]s, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as [[pigment]]s, even [[gunpowder]] and [[urine]]. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.common-place-archives.org/vol-12/no-01/reviews/mcneur.shtml|title=Review of The Ink of History|first=Catherine|last=McNeur|date=1 October 2011|journal=Common-Place|volume=12|issue=1}}</ref>\n\n====Freedom papers====\nBecause these [[protection papers]] were used to define freemen and citizenship, many black sailors and other men also used them to show that they were freemen if they were stopped by officials or slave catchers. They also called them \"free papers\" because they certified their non-slave status. Many of the freed blacks used descriptions of tattoos for identification purposes on their freedom papers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fDsHKydL67kC&lpg=PA305&ots=JJH4wIY5yh&dq=%22protection%20papers%22%20slavery&pg=PA305&v=onepage&q=%22protection%20papers%22%20slavery&f=false Law in American History: Volume 1: From the Colonial Years Through the Civil War.] Page 305.</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Fred_Harris_Tattoo_Studio_slnsw.jpg|thumb|Fred Harris, Tattoo Studio, Sydney, 1937]]\nBranding was used by European authorities for marking criminals throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<ref>Clare Andersen in Caplan, J.

After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a [[Homogenization (biology)|homogenized]] damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the [[immune system]]'s [[phagocyte]]s to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin [[granulation tissue]] forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by [[collagen]] growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within successive generations of [[macrophage]]s, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, but in the long term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.<ref name=kilmer>{{cite web|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1121212-overview|title=Tattoo Lasers: Overview, Histology, Tattoo Removal Techniques|date=13 September 2017|publisher=|via=eMedicine}}</ref>\n\n==Stencil and Hectograph==\nIn modern tattooing, an artist may use a Thermal stencil paper or [[Hectograph]] to first place the design print on the skin before working with the machine and needle on skin. This process has enabled Artists to create very detailed artworks on the skin.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:Tattoo machine 2 coil.jpg|thumb|A two coil tattoo machine]]\nSome tribal cultures traditionally created tattoos by cutting designs into the skin and rubbing the resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to [[scarification]]. Some cultures create tattooed marks by hand-tapping the ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones (made into needles) with clay formed disks or, in modern times, actual needles.\n\nThe most common method of tattooing in modern times is the electric [[tattoo machine]], which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle or a group of needles that are [[solder]]ed onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit. The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles in and out of the skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second. The needles are single-use needles that come packaged individually.\n\n==Practice regulation and Health risk certification==\nTattooing is regulated in many countries because of the associated health risks to client and practitioner, specifically local infections and virus transmission. Disposable plastic aprons and eye protection can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattooist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified [[autoclave]] before and after every use. It is good practice to provide clients with a printed consent form that outlines risks and complications as well as instructions for after care.<ref name=\"CIEH2013\">{{cite web|title=Tattooing and body piercing guidance: Toolkit|url=https://www.cieh.org/media/1261/tattooing-and-body-piercing-guidance-toolkit-july-2013.pdf|publisher=Chartered Institute of Environmental Health|accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Associations==\n\n===Historical associations===\n{{see also|Religious perspectives on tattooing}}\n[[File:Body art, 1907 black n white.jpg|thumb|[[Maud Wagner|Mrs. M.

Tattooing can be uncomfortable to excruciating depending on the area and can result in the person fainting. Modern tattooists reduce risks by following universal precautions working with single-use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have [[Blood-borne disease|blood-borne pathogen]] training such as that provided through the [[Red Cross]] and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]. As of 2009 (in the United States) there have been no reported cases of HIV contracted from tattoos.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/transmission.htm|title=HIV and Its Transmission|date=July 1999|publisher=CDC|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304131732/http://cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/transmission.htm|archivedate=4 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn amateur tattooing, such as that practiced in prisons, however, there is an elevated risk of infection.

Occasionally, when a [[blood vessel]] is punctured during the tattooing procedure, a [[bruise]]/[[hematoma]] may appear. At the same time, a number of tattoo inks may contain hazardous substances, and a proposal has been submitted by the [[European Chemicals Agency|European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)]] to restrict the intentional use or concentration limit of approximately 4 000 substances when contained in tattoo inks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://echa.europa.eu/-/proposal-to-restrict-hazardous-substances-in-tattoo-inks-and-permanent-make-up|title=Proposal to restrict hazardous substances in tattoo inks and permanent make-up - All news - ECHA|website=echa.europa.eu|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref> According to a study by the [https://euon.echa.europa.eu/ European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON]), a number of modern-day tattoo inks contain nanomaterials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://euon.echa.europa.eu/documents/23168237/24095696/070918_euon_nanopigments_literature_study_report_en.pdf/58977ab1-1059-4b41-f003-18ae9d7a157c|title=Literature study on the uses and risks of nanomaterials as pigments in the European Union|website=European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON)}}</ref>\n\nCertain colours - red or similar colours such as purple, pink, and orange - tend to cause more problems and damage compared to other colours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://livsstil.tv2.dk/kropogsundhed/2014-03-26-gode-r%C3%A5d-om-tatoveringer-de-her-farver-skal-du-undg%C3%A5|title=Gode r\u00e5d om tatoveringer: De her farver skal du undg\u00e5|date=26 March 2014|publisher=}}</ref> Red ink has even caused [[skin]] and [[flesh]] damages so severe that the [[amputation]] of a leg or an arm has been necessary.

Typically, black and some colored inks can be removed more completely than inks of other colors. The expense and pain associated with removing tattoos are typically greater than the expense and pain associated with applying them. Pre-laser tattoo removal methods include [[dermabrasion]], salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with [[salt]]), [[cryosurgery]] and [[wiktionary:excision|excision]]\u2014which is sometimes still used along with [[skin graft]]s for larger tattoos. These older methods, however, have been nearly completely replaced by laser removal treatment options.<ref>{{citation|title=Images of Tattoo removal procedure|url=http://www.tattoo-bewertung.de/content/aktuelle-laserbehandlung|accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Temporary tattoos==\n{{see also|Mehndi|Ballpoint pen artwork}}\nA '''temporary tattoo''' is a non-permanent image on the skin resembling a permanent tattoo.  As a form of [[body painting]], temporary tattoos can be drawn, painted, airbrushed, or needled in the same way as permanent tattoos, but with an ink which dissolves in the blood within 6 months.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Types of temporary tattoos===\n[[Image:Ambigram_tattoo_Love_Eros.jpg|thumb|right|[[Decal]] temporary [[ambigram]] tattoo ''[[Love]] / [[Eros (concept)|eros]]'', on wrists]]\n====Decal-style temporary tattoos====\n[[Decal]] (press-on) temporary tattoos are used to decorate any part of the body. They may last for a day or for more than a week.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm108569.htm | title=Temporary Tattoos, Henna/Mehndi, and \"Black Henna\" | work=FDA | accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Metallic jewelry tattoos====\nFoil temporary tattoos are a variation of decal-style temporary tattoos, printed using a foil stamping technique instead of using ink.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The foil design is printed as a mirror image in order to be viewed in the right direction once it is applied to the skin. Each metallic tattoo is protected by a transparent protective film.\n\n====Airbrush temporary tattoos====\nAlthough they have become more popular and usually require a greater investment, airbrush temporary tattoos are less likely to achieve the look of a permanent tattoo, and may not last as long as press-on temporary tattoos. An artist sprays on airbrush tattoos using a stencil with alcohol-based cosmetic inks. Like decal tattoos, airbrush temporary tattoos also are easily removed with rubbing alcohol or [[baby oil]].\n\n====Henna temporary tattoos====\n[[Image:Lower leg Tattoo.jpg|thumb|right|A [[henna]] temporary tattoo being applied]]\nAnother tattoo alternative is [[henna]]-based tattoos, which generally contain no additives. Henna is a plant-derived substance which is painted on the skin, staining it a reddish-orange-to-brown color. Because of the semi-permanent nature of henna, they lack the realistic colors typical of decal temporary tattoos. Due to the time-consuming application process, it is a relatively poor option for children. Dermatological publications report that allergic reactions to natural henna are very rare and the product is generally considered safe for skin application. Serious problems can occur, however, from the use of henna with certain additives. The FDA and medical journals report that painted black henna temporary tattoos are especially dangerous.\n\n===Temporary tattoo safety===\n====Decal-style temporary tattoo safety====\nDecal temporary tattoos, when legally sold in the United States, have had their color additives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as cosmetics \u2013 the FDA has determined these colorants are safe for \"direct dermal contact\". While the FDA has received some accounts of minor skin irritation, including redness and swelling, from this type of temporary tattoo, the agency has found these symptoms to be \"child specific\" and not significant enough to support warnings to the public. Unapproved pigments, however, which are sometimes used by non-US manufacturers, can provoke allergic reactions in anyone.\n\n====Airbrush tattoo safety====\nThe types of airbrush paints manufactured for crafting, creating art or decorating clothing should never be used for tattooing. These paints can be allergenic or toxic.\n\n====Henna tattoo safety====\n[[Image:Dermititis black henna.JPG|thumb|[[Dermatitis]] due to a temporary tattoo (dolphin) made with [[black henna]]]]\nThe [[FDA]] regularly issues warnings to consumers about avoiding any temporary tattoos labeled as black henna or pre-mixed henna as these may contain potentially harmful ingredients including [[silver nitrate]], [[carmine]], [[pyrogallol]], [[disperse orange dye]] and [[chromium]]. Black henna gets its color from [[paraphenylenediamine]] (PPD), a [[textile dye]] approved by the FDA for human use only in hair coloring.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/03/26/fda-warns-consumers-about-dangers-temporary-tattoos/ | title=FDA warns consumers about dangers of temporary tattoos | work=Fox News | date=26 March 2013 | accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref> In Canada, the use of PPD on the skin, including hair dye, is banned. Research has linked these and other ingredients to a range of health problems including allergic reactions, chronic inflammatory reactions, and late-onset allergic reactions to related clothing and hairdressing dyes. They can cause these reactions long after application. Neither black henna nor pre-mixed henna are approved for cosmetic use by the FDA.\n\n==Religious views==\n{{main|Religious perspectives on tattooing}}\n\n[[Egyptians]] originally used tattoos to show dedication to a god. This also showed protection. \nIn other religions like Hinduism and Neopaganism, tattoos are accepted. Christianity remains one of the religions without a definitive answer on tattoos.<ref name=\"ferguson\">{{cite web |last1=Ferguson |first1=Matthew |title=Opinions on tattoos differ by religion |url=http://websterjournal.com/2018/10/31/opinions-on-tattoos-differ-by-religion/ |website=Webster Journal |accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jesus is So Cool.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Christianity|Christian]] couple with matching cross symbol tattoos to associate with their faith]]\n[[Judaism]] generally prohibits tattoos among its adherents based on the commandments in [[Leviticus 19]].

The first recorded professional tattoo artist in the US was a German immigrant, [[Martin Hildebrandt]]. He opened a shop in New York City in 1846 and quickly became popular during the [[American Civil War]] among soldiers and sailors of both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] militaries.\n\nHildebrandt began traveling from camp to camp to tattoo soldiers, increasing his popularity and also giving birth to the tradition of getting tattoos while being an American serviceman. Soon after the Civil War, tattoos became fashionable among upper-class young adults. This trend lasted until the beginning of World War I. The invention of the electric tattoo machine caused popularity of tattoos among the wealthy to drop off. The machine made the tattooing procedure both much easier and cheaper, thus, eliminating the status symbol tattoos previously held, as they were now affordable for all socioeconomic classes. The status symbol of a tattoo shifted from a representation of wealth to a mark typically seen on rebels and criminals. Despite this change, tattoos remained popular among military servicemen, a tradition that continues today.\n\nIn 1975, there were only 40 tattoo artists in the country; in 1980, there were more than 5,000 self-proclaimed tattoo artists, {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} appearing in response to booming popularity in the skin mural trade.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1980/11/09/original-tattoo-artist-times-changing/99616353-ba75-477d-822c-4aeaf062d17a/|title=Original Tattoo Artist: Times Changing|date=1980-11-09|work=Washington Post|access-date=2019-03-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\nMany studies have been done of the tattooed population and society's view of tattoos.

These were simple documents that described the sailor as being an American sailor. Many of the protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the [[Royal Navy]] paid no attention to them. In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.' <ref>[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1992/spring/seamans-protection.html \"Genealogical Fallout from the War of 1812.\"] By Ruth Priest Dixon. ''Prologue Magazine''. Spring 1992. Volume 24 (1).</ref> One way of making them more specific was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal, and thus use that description to identify the seaman. As a result, many of the later certificates carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as other specific information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen. Frequently their 'protection papers' made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.<ref>Smith, Gene Allan. 2013. ''The Slave's Gamble''. MacMillan. Page 55.</ref>\n\nIn the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tattoos were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the protection papers issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-[[passport]]s catalogued tattoos alongside [[birthmark]]s, [[scar]]s, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as [[pigment]]s, even [[gunpowder]] and [[urine]]. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.common-place-archives.org/vol-12/no-01/reviews/mcneur.shtml|title=Review of The Ink of History|first=Catherine|last=McNeur|date=1 October 2011|journal=Common-Place|volume=12|issue=1}}</ref>\n\n====Freedom papers====\nBecause these [[protection papers]] were used to define freemen and citizenship, many black sailors and other men also used them to show that they were freemen if they were stopped by officials or slave catchers. They also called them \"free papers\" because they certified their non-slave status. Many of the freed blacks used descriptions of tattoos for identification purposes on their freedom papers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fDsHKydL67kC&lpg=PA305&ots=JJH4wIY5yh&dq=%22protection%20papers%22%20slavery&pg=PA305&v=onepage&q=%22protection%20papers%22%20slavery&f=false Law in American History: Volume 1: From the Colonial Years Through the Civil War.] Page 305.</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Fred_Harris_Tattoo_Studio_slnsw.jpg|thumb|Fred Harris, Tattoo Studio, Sydney, 1937]]\nBranding was used by European authorities for marking criminals throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<ref>Clare Andersen in Caplan, J.

After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a [[Homogenization (biology)|homogenized]] damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the [[immune system]]'s [[phagocyte]]s to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin [[granulation tissue]] forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by [[collagen]] growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within successive generations of [[macrophage]]s, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, but in the long term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.<ref name=kilmer>{{cite web|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1121212-overview|title=Tattoo Lasers: Overview, Histology, Tattoo Removal Techniques|date=13 September 2017|publisher=|via=eMedicine}}</ref>\n\n==Stencil and Hectograph==\nIn modern tattooing, an artist may use a Thermal stencil paper or [[Hectograph]] to first place the design print on the skin before working with the machine and needle on skin. This process has enabled Artists to create very detailed artworks on the skin.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:Tattoo machine 2 coil.jpg|thumb|A two coil tattoo machine]]\nSome tribal cultures traditionally created tattoos by cutting designs into the skin and rubbing the resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to [[scarification]]. Some cultures create tattooed marks by hand-tapping the ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones (made into needles) with clay formed disks or, in modern times, actual needles.\n\nThe most common method of tattooing in modern times is the electric [[tattoo machine]], which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle or a group of needles that are [[solder]]ed onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit. The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles in and out of the skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second. The needles are single-use needles that come packaged individually.\n\n==Practice regulation and Health risk certification==\nTattooing is regulated in many countries because of the associated health risks to client and practitioner, specifically local infections and virus transmission. Disposable plastic aprons and eye protection can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattooist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified [[autoclave]] before and after every use. It is good practice to provide clients with a printed consent form that outlines risks and complications as well as instructions for after care.<ref name=\"CIEH2013\">{{cite web|title=Tattooing and body piercing guidance: Toolkit|url=https://www.cieh.org/media/1261/tattooing-and-body-piercing-guidance-toolkit-july-2013.pdf|publisher=Chartered Institute of Environmental Health|accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Associations==\n\n===Historical associations===\n{{see also|Religious perspectives on tattooing}}\n[[File:Body art, 1907 black n white.jpg|thumb|[[Maud Wagner|Mrs. M.

Tattooing can be uncomfortable to excruciating depending on the area and can result in the person fainting. Modern tattooists reduce risks by following universal precautions working with single-use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have [[Blood-borne disease|blood-borne pathogen]] training such as that provided through the [[Red Cross]] and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]].

Typically, black and some colored inks can be removed more completely than inks of other colors. The expense and pain associated with removing tattoos are typically greater than the expense and pain associated with applying them. Pre-laser tattoo removal methods include [[dermabrasion]], salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with [[salt]]), [[cryosurgery]] and [[wiktionary:excision|excision]]\u2014which is sometimes still used along with [[skin graft]]s for larger tattoos.

As a form of [[body painting]], temporary tattoos can be drawn, painted, airbrushed, or needled in the same way as permanent tattoos, but with an ink which dissolves in the blood within 6 months.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Types of temporary tattoos===\n[[Image:Ambigram_tattoo_Love_Eros.jpg|thumb|right|[[Decal]] temporary [[ambigram]] tattoo ''[[Love]] / [[Eros (concept)|eros]]'', on wrists]]\n====Decal-style temporary tattoos====\n[[Decal]] (press-on) temporary tattoos are used to decorate any part of the body. They may last for a day or for more than a week.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm108569.htm | title=Temporary Tattoos, Henna/Mehndi, and \"Black Henna\" | work=FDA | accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Metallic jewelry tattoos====\nFoil temporary tattoos are a variation of decal-style temporary tattoos, printed using a foil stamping technique instead of using ink.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The foil design is printed as a mirror image in order to be viewed in the right direction once it is applied to the skin. Each metallic tattoo is protected by a transparent protective film.\n\n====Airbrush temporary tattoos====\nAlthough they have become more popular and usually require a greater investment, airbrush temporary tattoos are less likely to achieve the look of a permanent tattoo, and may not last as long as press-on temporary tattoos. An artist sprays on airbrush tattoos using a stencil with alcohol-based cosmetic inks. Like decal tattoos, airbrush temporary tattoos also are easily removed with rubbing alcohol or [[baby oil]].\n\n====Henna temporary tattoos====\n[[Image:Lower leg Tattoo.jpg|thumb|right|A [[henna]] temporary tattoo being applied]]\nAnother tattoo alternative is [[henna]]-based tattoos, which generally contain no additives. Henna is a plant-derived substance which is painted on the skin, staining it a reddish-orange-to-brown color. Because of the semi-permanent nature of henna, they lack the realistic colors typical of decal temporary tattoos. Due to the time-consuming application process, it is a relatively poor option for children. Dermatological publications report that allergic reactions to natural henna are very rare and the product is generally considered safe for skin application. Serious problems can occur, however, from the use of henna with certain additives. The FDA and medical journals report that painted black henna temporary tattoos are especially dangerous.\n\n===Temporary tattoo safety===\n====Decal-style temporary tattoo safety====\nDecal temporary tattoos, when legally sold in the United States, have had their color additives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as cosmetics \u2013 the FDA has determined these colorants are safe for \"direct dermal contact\". While the FDA has received some accounts of minor skin irritation, including redness and swelling, from this type of temporary tattoo, the agency has found these symptoms to be \"child specific\" and not significant enough to support warnings to the public. Unapproved pigments, however, which are sometimes used by non-US manufacturers, can provoke allergic reactions in anyone.\n\n====Airbrush tattoo safety====\nThe types of airbrush paints manufactured for crafting, creating art or decorating clothing should never be used for tattooing. These paints can be allergenic or toxic.\n\n====Henna tattoo safety====\n[[Image:Dermititis black henna.JPG|thumb|[[Dermatitis]] due to a temporary tattoo (dolphin) made with [[black henna]]]]\nThe [[FDA]] regularly issues warnings to consumers about avoiding any temporary tattoos labeled as black henna or pre-mixed henna as these may contain potentially harmful ingredients including [[silver nitrate]], [[carmine]], [[pyrogallol]], [[disperse orange dye]] and [[chromium]]. Black henna gets its color from [[paraphenylenediamine]] (PPD), a [[textile dye]] approved by the FDA for human use only in hair coloring.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/03/26/fda-warns-consumers-about-dangers-temporary-tattoos/ | title=FDA warns consumers about dangers of temporary tattoos | work=Fox News | date=26 March 2013 | accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref> In Canada, the use of PPD on the skin, including hair dye, is banned. Research has linked these and other ingredients to a range of health problems including allergic reactions, chronic inflammatory reactions, and late-onset allergic reactions to related clothing and hairdressing dyes. They can cause these reactions long after application. Neither black henna nor pre-mixed henna are approved for cosmetic use by the FDA.\n\n==Religious views==\n{{main|Religious perspectives on tattooing}}\n\n[[Egyptians]] originally used tattoos to show dedication to a god. This also showed protection. \nIn other religions like Hinduism and Neopaganism, tattoos are accepted.

There are no written records stating the exact date their ancestors settled in the present location.  Be that as it may, those who were verse in oral history and generation age calculation estimated it to be over 1,500 years. \u201cUdoabia\u201d for short called Udo, meaning \"Peace has come in our Community\" and an ancient town located East of [[Ezinihitte-Mbaise|Ezinihitte Mbaise]] Local Government Area. The Community is situated at the shores of the [[Imo River]]. The Community shares border with Umunwanwa in [[Abia (state)|Abia State]] and [[Obowo]] in [[Imo (state)|Imo State]]. A rural agrarian and fishing community. Udo played host to early Christian Missionaries who settled by the river bank and traded in palm kernel.\n\nThe present traditional ruler, Eze M.C. Ukeje JP, Udoabia IV is one of the oldest and longest serving traditional rulers in the entire Imo State having ascended the throne in 1977. Udo is a community in Ezinihitte clan. Oral history traces the origin of Udo to Udoabia who was a direct son of Ezinihitte.\n\n==Migration==\n\nMany centuries ago Udoabia the progenitor of Udo Ancient Kingdom sojourned at the present Umuezeukwu Onicha briefly, Migrated and settled also at Eziama Onicha many years ago.\n\nUdoabia finally left Eziama Onicha and settled to its present location. This was estimated to be over 1,500 years ago.\n\nThis historical fact of Udoabia\u2019s sojourn at Eziama Onicha before his final settlement in this place called Udo, gave birth to cultural ceremony of ''Ibo Uzo Ukwu'' (meaning seasonal weeding of track road Udoabia took and returned to Udo from Onicha). The ceremony is performed every November 4. Once this ceremony is performed, no pledger will be permitted to redeem his land until the next farming year. This ceremony used to be centre of attraction in that it was rotatory between Udo and Eziama Onicha. On a yearly basis, one community will weed track up to the boundary of the other and mutatis-mutandis after which there will be elaborate merriment. There is this believe that Udoabia may have left Eziama behind at Onicha that explains why Udo and Eziama Onicha cannot intermarry. While it is true that Udo and Eziama cannot intermarry, it has not been proved with scientific or historical fact as to why they cannot intermarry or whether Eziama was left behind at Onicha. When Udo was returning, he came back with his two sons namely, [[Umuneorie]] and [[Umuofor]] while he begot [[Uhuala]] in Udo on return.\n\nEach of the three sons of Udo married and had children. The descendants of first son \u201cOrie\u201d multiplied in numbers to become Umuneorie which means children of Orie. Same applied to Ofo now called Umuofo and Uhuala. It is instructive to state that Ofo and Uhuola are of the same mother and this explains why Umuofor and Uhuala villages do not intermarry.\n\nThe name Udo originated from their ancient descendant and original ancestor called Udoabia. This explains why all the traditional rulers have as suffix to their names as title indicating a dynasty of UDOABIA. It is the three sons of Udo that formed the three villages and thirteen kindreds.\n\nFrom the inception of British Rule, particularly in the early 20th century, the successive traditional rulers of Udo have been recognized by government. These were Eze Onyewuchi Ogumba 1903-1925, Eze Uwalaka Nzerem 1925-1942, Chief Godwin Esonu 1944-1959 as a warrant Chief, Rev. Aaron Ezebugwu Ohaeri 1959-1976, who was elected head of Ezi Clan in 1960 to represent Ezi Clan in the Eastern House of Chiefs, Enugu, and the present Eze Eze (Dr.) Mathew Chukwuemeka Ukeje JP from 1976 till date. Eze M.C Ukeje has been on the throne for 38 years. He is one of the longest serving Eze in Imo State.\n\nUdo is one of the few Original Ancient Kingdoms that has not been fragmented.\n\nUdo has remained one indivisible and indissoluble autonomous Community under God in [[Ezinihitte-Mbaise|Ezinihitte]]. By implication the only community that has retained its originality as it was at creation at Orie-Ukwu. This is why it qualified to be called Ancient Kingdom. Udo is governed with constitution. Her population is about '''22,000'''\n\nThe community is blessed with [[Imo River]] and beautiful streams in all the villages which has provided a source of livelihood to the entire citizens. Most of the sand and gravel supplied to needing communities in [[Mbaise]] and beyond is excavated from the River. [[Hippopotamus]] or [[Enyimiri]] and fish are a common sea animal\u2019s people hunt and trade on.\n\nUdo is decorated with beautiful fauna and flora. The land in Udo is fertile which has made it possible for cultivation of different seasonal crops. The half proportion of the community is table land while some areas are erosion prone specially Uhuala and Umuneorie. These erosion, if not checked would cause menace to the lives of the inhabitants of these areas.\n\nThe main occupation of the people i.e. for the local populace is trading, farming, fishing.\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe Community which covers an area of approximately 20 square kilometers is situated west of the [[Imo River]], bounded on the East by Umunwanwa in [[Abia (state)|Abia State]], West by Obokwu/Obizi Communities in [[Ezinihitte-Mbaise|Ezinihitte Mbaise]] Local Government, on the South by [[Nsirimo]] also in [[Abia (state)|Abia State]] and on the North by Avutu in Obowo Local Government of [[Imo (state)|Imo State.]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/205008180003103/|title=Udo Worldwide|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}\n\n{{coord missing|Nigeria}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Abia State]]\n", "text_old": "{{tone|date=April 2016}}\n{{more references|date=April 2016}}\n\n'''Udo''' is a populated area in Ezinihitte Mbaise, Imo State Nigeria.\n\n==History==\nUdo is not without folklore told to the people by their forefather and handed down from generation to generation.

Survival of the young depends heavily on the availability of prey species. In the wild, both males and females reach sexual maturity at the age of one year, though in practice they rarely breed until a territory becomes vacant; one female was known not to breed until five years old when its mother died.

A kitten will frequently kill its littermate in a brutal fight. It is unknown why these episodes of aggression occur, though many scientists believe it is related to a change in hormones when a kitten switches from its mother's milk to meat. Others believe it is related to hierarchy, and \"[[survival of the fittest]]\".\n\nDifficulty in finding mates has led to more inbreeding, which results in fewer kittens and a greater rate of non-traumatic death.<ref name=EJWR2012>{{cite journal |first=F. |last=Palomares |first2=J.
