The government formally recognizes five religions: [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], and [[Islam]] (though the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association|Chinese Catholic Church]] is independent of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church in Rome]]). In the early twenty-first century there has been increasing official recognition of [[Confucianism]] and [[Chinese folk religion]] as part of [[Culture of China|China's cultural inheritance]].\n\nFolk or popular religion, the most widespread system of beliefs and practices, has evolved and adapted since at least the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties in the second millennium BCE. Fundamental elements of a [[Chinese theology|theology and spiritual explanation]] for the nature of the universe harken back to this period and were further elaborated in the [[Axial Age]]. Basically, Chinese religion involves allegiance to the ''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'', often translated as \"spirits\", defining a variety of [[Chinese gods and immortals|gods and immortals]]. These may be [[deity|deities]] of the natural environment or [[progenitor|ancestral principles]] of human groups, concepts of civility, [[culture hero]]es, many of whom feature in [[Chinese mythology]] and history.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996}} Confucian philosophy and religious practice began their long evolution during the later Zhou; Taoist institutionalized religions developed by the [[Han dynasty]]; [[Chinese Buddhism]] became widely popular by the [[Tang dynasty]], and in response Confucian thinkers developed [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] philosophies; and [[Chinese salvationist religions|popular movements of salvation]] and local [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] thrived.\n\n[[Christianity in China|Christianity]] and [[Islam in China|Islam]] arrived in China in the 7th century.

Mediatory individuals such as shamans communicated prayers, sacrifices or offerings directly to the spiritual world, a heritage that survives in some modern forms of Chinese religion.{{sfnb|Yang|Lang|2012|p=112}}\n\nAncient shamanism is especially connected to ancient Neolithic cultures such as the [[Hongshan culture]].<ref>{{cite article|last1=Nelson|first1=Sarah M.|last2=Matson|first2=Rachel A.|last3=Roberts|first3=Rachel M.|last4=Rock|first4=Chris|last5=Stencel|first5=Robert E.|title=Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang|year=2006}}</ref> The Flemish philosopher [[Ulrich Libbrecht]] traces the origins of some features of Taoism to what [[Jan Jakob Maria de Groot]] called \"Wuism\",{{sfnb|De Groot|1892|loc=''passim'' Vol. 6}} that is Chinese shamanism.{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}}\n\nLibbrecht distinguishes two layers in the development of the [[Chinese theology]] and religion that continues to this day, traditions derived respectively from the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] (1600\u20131046 BCE) and subsequent [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties (1046\u2013256 BCE). The religion of the Shang was based on the worship of ancestors and god-kings, who survived as unseen divine forces after death. They were not transcendent entities, since the universe was \"by itself so\", not created by a force outside of it but generated by internal rhythms and cosmic powers. The royal ancestors were called ''di'' ({{lang|zh|\u5e1d}}), \"deities\", and the utmost progenitor was ''[[Shangdi]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u5e1d}} \"Highest Deity\"). Shangdi is identified with the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], symbol of the unlimited power (''[[qi]]''),{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} of the \"protean\" primordial power which embodies [[yin and yang]] in unity, associated to the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] which winds around the north [[orbital pole|ecliptic pole]],{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|p=55}} and slithers between the [[Ursa Minor|Little]] and [[Big Dipper]] (or Great Chariot). Already in Shang theology, the multiplicity of gods of nature and ancestors were viewed as parts of Di, and the four {{lang|zh|\u65b9}} ''[[Wufang Shangdi|f\u0101ng]]'' (\"directions\" or \"sides\") and their {{lang|zh|\u98a8}} ''f\u0113ng'' (\"winds\") as his [[cosmos|cosmic]] will.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=143\u2013144, Vol. II}}\n\nThe Zhou dynasty, which overthrew the Shang, was more rooted in an [[agriculture|agricultural]] worldview, and they emphasised a more universal idea of ''[[Tian]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u5929}} \"Heaven\").{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} The Shang dynasty's identification of Shangdi as their ancestor-god had asserted their claim to power by divine right; the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power, the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. In Zhou theology, Tian had no singular earthly progeny, but bestowed divine favour on virtuous rulers. Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people, while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by Tian.{{sfnb|Fung|2008|p=163}}\n\nJohn C. Didier and David Pankenier relate the shapes of both the ancient [[Chinese characters]] for Di and Tian to the patterns of stars in the northern skies, either drawn, in Didier's theory by connecting the constellations bracketing the north celestial pole as a square,{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=103, Vol. II}} or in Pankenier's theory by connecting some of the stars which form the constellations of the Big Dipper and broader [[Ursa Major]], and [[Ursa Minor]] (Little Dipper).{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|pp=138\u2013148, \"Chapter 4: Bringing Heaven Down to Earth\"}} Cultures in other parts of the world have also conceived these stars or constellations as symbols of the origin of things, the supreme godhead, divinity and royal power.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim'' Vol. I}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=center|width=100\n|header=<small>Shang and Zhou graphemes for Di and Tian</small>\n|image1=Shang grapheme for D\u00ec \u5e1d (Deity), version 1.svg|caption1=\u2460\n|image2=Shang grapheme for D\u00ec \u5e1d (Deity), version 2.svg|caption2=\u2461\n|image3=Shang grapheme for d\u00ec \u7998 or d\u01d0ng \u9f0e (to divine, to sacrifice).svg|caption3=\u2462\n|image4=Shang grapheme for Sh\u00e0ngji\u01ce \u4e0a\u7532 (Supreme Ancestor), version 1.svg|caption4=\u2463\n|image5=Zhou grapheme for Ti\u0101n \u5929 (Heaven), version 1.svg|caption5=\u2464\n|image6=Zhou grapheme for Ti\u0101n \u5929 (Heaven), version 2.svg|caption6=\u2465\n|footer=\u2776 One version of the Shang grapheme for the nominal ''D\u00ec'' [[regular script|k]]:{{lang|zh|\u5e1d}} (\"Deity\", \"deities\", \"divinity\"), which according to David W.

Confucius saw an opportunity to reinforce values of compassion and tradition into society. Disillusioned with the widespread vulgarisation of the rituals to access Tian, he began to preach an ethical interpretation of traditional Zhou religion. In his view, the power of Tian is immanent, and responds positively to the sincere heart driven by humaneness and rightness, decency and altruism. Confucius conceived these qualities as the foundation needed to restore socio-political harmony. Like many contemporaries, Confucius saw ritual practices as efficacious ways to access Tian, but he thought that the crucial knot was the state of [[meditation]] that participants enter prior to engage in the ritual acts.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=xxxviii, Vol. I}} Confucius amended and recodified the [[Chinese classics|classical books]] inherited from the Xia-Shang-Zhou dynasties, and composed the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''.{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=1}}\n\nPhilosophers in the Warring States compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', and formulated the classical metaphysics which became the lash of Confucianism. In accordance with the Master, they identified mental tranquility as the state of Tian, or the One (\u4e00 ''Y\u012b''), which in each individual is the Heaven-bestowed divine power to rule one's own life and the world. Going beyond the Master, they theorised the oneness of production and reabsorption into the cosmic source, and the possibility to understand and therefore reattain it through meditation. This line of thought would have influenced all Chinese individual and collective-political mystical theories and practices thereafter.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxviii\u2013xxxix, Vol. I}}\n\nAccording to [[Zhou Youguang]], Confucianism's name in Chinese, basically {{lang|zh|\u5112}} ''r\u00fa'', originally referred to shamanic methods of holding rites and existed before Confucius' times, but with Confucius it came to mean devotion to propagating such teachings to bring civilisation to the people. Confucianism was initiated by Confucius, developed by [[Mencius]] (~372\u2013289 BCE) and inherited by later generations, undergoing constant transformations and restructuring since its establishment, but preserving the principles of humaneness and righteousness at its core.{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=1}}\n\n===Qin and Han dynasties===\n[[File:Tai'an Dai Miao 2015.08.13 10-17-53.jpg|thumb|250px|Main hall of the Dai Temple ({{lang|zh|\u5cb1\u5e99}} ''D\u00e0imi\u00e0o'') at [[Mount Tai]].

It was in this period that religious focus shifted to the [[Di (Chinese concept)|Earth]] ({{lang|zh|\u5730}} ''D\u00ec''), regarded as representative of Heaven's (celestial pole's) power. In the Han period, the philosophical concern was especially the crucial role of the human being on earth, completing the cosmological trinity of Heaven-Earth-humanity ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u5730\u4eba}} ''Ti\u0101nd\u00ecr\u00e9n'').

This was also true for royal ancestors of the early Zhou dynasty.{{sfnb|Zhou|2005|pp=7\u20138}} The difference rests upon the fact that the Yellow Emperor was no longer an exclusive ancestor of some royal lineage, but rather a more universal archetype of the human being.

Prospects for a better personal life and salvation appealed to the masses who were periodically hit by natural disasters and galvanised by uprisings organised by self-proclaimed \"kings\" and \"heirs\". In such harsh conditions, while the imperial cult continued the sacrifices to the cosmological gods, common people estranged from the rationalism of the state religion found solace in enlightened masters and in reviving and perpetuating more or less abandoned cults of national, regional and local divinities that better represented indigenous identities. The Han state religion itself was \"ethnicised\" by associating the cosmological deities to regional populations.{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nBy the end of the dynasty (206 BCE\u20138 CE) the earliest record of a mass religious movement attests the excitement provoked by the belief in the imminent advent of the [[Queen Mother of the West]] ({{lang|zh|\u897f\u738b\u6bcd}} ''X\u012bw\u00e1ngm\u01d4'') in the northeastern provinces (then [[Henan]], [[Hebei]] and [[Shandong]]) in the first half of the year 3 BCE.

During a military mission in Hanning (modern southwest [[Shaanxi]]), Xiu either died in battle or was killed by Lu himself, who incorporated Xiu's followers and seized the city, which he renamed [[Hanzhong]]. A characteristic of the territory governed by Lu was its significant non-Chinese population.

This led to the foundation of two new Taoist schools, with their own scriptural and ritual bodies: [[Shangqing Taoism]] ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u6e05\u6d3e}} ''Sh\u00e0ngq\u012bngp\u00e0i'', \"Highest Clarity school\"), based on revelations that occurred between 364 and 370 in modern-day [[Nanjing]], and [[Lingbao Taoism]] ({{lang|zh|\u7075\u5b9d\u6d3e}} ''L\u00edngb\u01ceop\u00e0i'', \"Numinous Gem school\"), based on revelations of the years between 397 and 402 and recodified later by Lu Xiujing (406-77). Lingbao incorporated from Buddhism the ideas of \"universal salvation\" and ranked \"heavens\", and focused on communal rituals.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2016}}{{rp|3.3}}\n\nBuddhism brought a model of afterlife to Chinese people and had a deep influence on Chinese culture. The story ''[[Mulian Rescues His Mother]]'', for instance, is a parable dated back to the 3rd century, which adapts an originally Buddhist fable to show Confucian values of filial piety. In the story, a virtuous monk descends into hell to rescue his mother, who had been condemned for her transgressions.{{sfnb|Teiser|1988|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n===Sui and Tang dynasties===\nIn the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) the concept of \"Tian\" became more common at the expense of \"Di\", continuing a tendency that started in the Han dynasty. Both also expanded their meanings, with \"di\" now more frequently used as suffix of a deity's name rather than to refer to the supreme power. \"Tian\", besides, became more associated to its meaning of \"[[Heaven]]\" as a [[paradise]] or the hierarchy of physical skies. The proliferation of foreign religions in the Tang, especially Buddhist sects, entailed that each of them conceived their own ideal \"Heaven\". \"Tian\" itself started to be used, linguistically, as an affix in composite names to mean \"heavenly\" or \"divine\". This was also the case in the Buddhist context, with many monasteries' names containing this element.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nUnder the influence of foreign cultures and thought systems, new concepts to refer to the supreme God were formulated, such as ''Ti\u0101nzh\u014dngti\u0101n'' ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u4e2d\u5929}} \"God of the Gods\"), seemingly introduced by [[Yuezhi]] Buddhist missionaries to render the [[Sanskrit]] ''Dev\u0101tideva'' (of the same meaning) or ''[[Bhagavan|Bhagav\u0101n]]'' from their Iranian sources.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|p=38}}\n\nBoth Buddhism and Taoism developed hierarchic pantheons which merged metaphysical (celestial) and physical (terrestrial) being, blurring the edge between the human and the divine, which reinforced the religious belief that gods and devotees sustain one another.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|p=42}}\n\n====The cult of the City Gods====\n[[File:The Temple of the Town Deity in Sheng County 44 2017-03.jpg|thumb|250px|Temple of the City God of [[Sheng County]], [[Zhejiang]].

The late Tang dynasty saw the spread of the cult of the [[City God (China)|City Gods]] in direct bond to the development of the cities as centres of commerce and the rise in influence of merchant classes. Commercial travel opened China to influences from foreign cultures.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|p=43. Cit. Ebrey, Patricia Buckley, and Peter N. Gregory, ed. ''Religion and Society in Tang and Song China''.

Jones (2007), ''Ritual and Music of North China: Shawm Bands in Shanxi''). He also describes shamans or media known by different names: ''mapi'' {{lang|zh|\u99ac\u88e8}}, ''wupo'' {{lang|zh|\u5deb\u5a46}}, ''shen momo'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u5b24\u5b24}} or ''shen han'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u6f22}} (p. 87); ''xingdao de'' {{lang|zh|\u9999\u9053\u7684}} (\"practitioners of the incense way\"; p. 85); village ''xiangtou'' {{lang|zh|\u9999\u982d}} (\"incense heads\"; p. 86); ''matong'' {{lang|zh|\u99ac\u7ae5}} (the same as southern ''[[tongji (spirit medium)|jitong]]''), either ''wushen'' {{lang|zh|\u5deb\u795e}} (possessed by gods) or ''shenguan'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u5b98}} (possessed by immortals; pp. 88\u201389); or \"godly sages\" (''shensheng'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u8056}}; p. 91). Further (p. 76), he discusses, for example, the ''sai'' {{lang|zh|\u8cfd}}, ceremonies of thanksgiving to the gods in [[Shanxi]] with roots in the [[Song dynasty|Song era]], whose leaders very often corresponded to local political authorities. This pattern continues today with former village Communist Party secretaries elected as temple association bosses (p. 83). He concludes (p. 92): \"In sum, since at least the early twentieth century the majority of local ritual leaders in north China have been products of their own or nearby communities. They have special skills in organization, ritual performance or interaction with the gods, but none are full-time ritual specialists; they have all \u2018kept their day jobs\u2019! As such they are exemplars of ordinary people organizing and carrying out their own cultural traditions, persistent traditions with their own structure, functions and logic that deserve to be understood as such.\"}} Northern and southern folk religions also have a different [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], of which the northern one is composed of more ancient gods of [[Chinese mythology]].{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=3|ps=: \"[...] there are significant differences between aspects of local religion in the south and north, one of which is the gods who are worshiped.\"; p. 33: \"[...] the veneration in the north of ancient deities attested to in pre-Han sources, deities such as N\u00fcwa, Fuxi and Shennong, the legendary founder of agriculture and herbal medicine. In some instances these gods were worshiped at places believed to be where they originated, with indications of grottoes, temples and festivals for them, some of which continue to exist or have been revived. Of course, these gods were worshiped elsewhere in China as well, though perhaps not with the same sense of original geographical location.\"}}\n\n[[Chinese salvationist religions|Folk religious movements of salvation]] have historically been more successful in the central plains and in the northeastern provinces than in southern China, and central-northern popular religion shares characteristics of some of the sects, such as the great importance given to [[Chinese mother goddess worship|mother goddess worship]] and shamanism,{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=15|ps=: \"[...] Popular religious sects with their own forms of organization, leaders, deities, rituals, beliefs and scripture texts were active throughout the Ming and Qing periods, particularly in north China. Individuals and families who joined them were promised special divine protection in this life and the next by leaders who functioned both as ritual masters and missionaries. These sects were more active in some communities than in others, but in principle were open to all who responded to these leaders and believed in their efficacy and teachings, so some of these groups spread to wide areas of the country. [...] significant for us here though is evidence for the residual influence of sectarian beliefs and practices on non-sectarian community religion where the sects no longer exist, particularly the feminization of deities by adding to their names the characters ''mu'' or ''Laomu'', Mother or Venerable Mother, as in ''Guanyin Laomu'', ''Puxianmu'', ''Dizangmu'', etc., based on the name of the chief sectarian deity, ''Wusheng Laomu'', the Eternal Venerable Mother. ''Puxian'' and ''Dizang'' are bodhisattvas normally considered 'male', though in Buddhist theory such gender categories don\u2019t really apply.

The performance of rites ({{lang|zh|\u793c}} ''l\u01d0'') is the key characteristic of common Chinese religion, which scholars see as going back to Neolithic times. According to the scholar [[Stephan Feuchtwang]], rites are conceived as \"what makes the invisible visible\", making possible for humans to cultivate the underlying order of nature. Correctly performed rituals move society in alignment with earthly and heavenly (astral) forces, establishing the harmony of the three realms\u2014Heaven, Earth and humanity. This practice is defined as \"centring\" ({{lang|zh|\u592e}} ''y\u0101ng'' or {{lang|zh|\u4e2d}} ''zh\u014dng''). Rituals may be performed by government officials, family elders, popular ritual masters and Taoists, the latter cultivating local gods to centre the forces of the universe upon a particular locality. Among all things of creation, humans themselves are \"central\" because they have the ability to cultivate and centre natural forces.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=150}}\n\nThis primordial sense of ritual united the moral and the religious and drew no boundaries between family, social, and political life. From earliest times, the Chinese tended to be all-embracing rather than to treat different religious traditions as separate and independent. The scholar [[Xinzhong Yao]] argues that the term \"Chinese religion\", therefore, does not imply that there is only one religious system, but that the \"different ways of believing and practicing... are rooted in and can be defined by culturally common themes and features\", and that \"different religious streams and strands have formed a culturally unitary single tradition\" in which basic concepts and practices are related.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe continuity of Chinese civilisation across thousands of years and thousands of square miles is made possible through China's religious traditions understood as systems of knowledge transmission.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=17}} A worthy Chinese is supposed to remember a vast amount of information from the past, and to draw on this past to form his moral reasoning.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=17}} The remembrance of the past and of ancestors is important for individuals and groups. The identities of descent-based groups are molded by stories, written genealogies (''[[zupu]]'', \"books of ancestors\"), temple activities, and village theatre which link them to history.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=18}}\n\nThis reliance on group memory is the foundation of the Chinese practice of [[Chinese ancestor worship|ancestor worship]] ({{lang|zh|\u62dc\u7956}} ''b\u00e0iz\u01d4'' or {{lang|zh|\u656c\u7956}} ''j\u00ecngz\u01d4'') which dates back to prehistory, and is the focal aspect of Chinese religion.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=18}} Defined as \"the essential religion of the Chinese\", ancestor worship is the means of memory and therefore of the cultural vitality of the entire Chinese civilisation.{{sfnb|Yang|1961|p=53}} Rites, symbols, objects and ideas construct and transmit group and individual identities.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|pp=144\u2013153}} Rituals and sacrifices are employed not only to seek blessing from the ancestors, but also to create a communal and educational religious environment in which people are firmly linked with a glorified history. Ancestors are evoked as gods and kept alive in these ceremonies to bring good luck and protect from evil forces and [[ghosts in Chinese culture|ghosts]].{{sfnb|Yao|2010|pp=114, 177}}\n\nThe two major festivals involving ancestor worship are the [[Qingming Festival]] and the [[Double Ninth Festival]], but veneration of ancestors is held in many other ceremonies, including [[Chinese marriage|weddings]], funerals, and [[triad (underground society)|triad]] initiations. Worshippers generally offer prayers through a ''[[jingxiang]]'' rite, with offerings of food, light [[incense]] and candles, and burning [[joss paper]]. These activities are typically conducted at the site of ancestral graves or tombs, at an ancestral temple, or at a household shrine.\n\nA practice developed in the Chinese folk religion of post-Maoist China, that started in the 1990s from the [[Temple of Confucius|Confucian temples]] managed by the Kong kin (the lineage of the descendants of Confucius himself), is the representation of ancestors in [[ancestral shrine]]s no longer just through tablets with their names, but through statues. Statuary effigies were previously exclusively used for Buddhist bodhisattva and Taoist gods.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n[[Chinese lineage associations|Lineage cults]] of the founders of [[Chinese surname|surname]]s and [[Chinese kin|kins]] are religious microcosms which are part of a larger organism, that is the cults of the ancestor-gods of regional and ethnic groups, which in turn are part of a further macrocosm, the cults of virtuous historical figures that have had an important impact in the history of China, notable examples including [[Confucius]], [[Guan Yu|Guandi]], or [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]], [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]] and [[Chiyou]], the latter three considered ancestor-gods of the [[Han Chinese]] (Huangdi and Yandi) and of western minority ethnicities and foreigners (Chiyou). This hierarchy proceeds up to the gods of the cosmos, the [[Di (Chinese concept)|Earth]] and [[Tian|Heaven]] itself. In other words, ancestors are regarded as the equivalent of Heaven within human society,{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=76\u201377}} and are therefore the means connecting back to Heaven as the \"utmost ancestral father\" ({{lang|zh|\u66fe\u7956\u7236}} ''z\u0113ngz\u01d4f\u00f9'').{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=84, note 282}}\n\n===Theological and cosmological discourse===\n[[File:Precessional north pole (B\u011bij\u00ed \u5317\u6781) in \u03b1 Ursae Minoris, drawing a w\u00e0n \u534d in the four phases of time.svg|thumb|300px|Like other symbols such as the ''[[swastika]]'',{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=256, Vol. III}} ''w\u00e0n'' {{lang|zh|\u534d}} (\"myriad things\") in Chinese, the [[Mesopotamia]]n \ud808\udc2d ''[[Dingir]]''/''[[Anu|An]]'' (\"Heaven\"),<ref name=Mair2011/> and also the Chinese {{lang|zh|\u5deb}} ''[[wu (shaman)|w\u016b]]'' (\"shaman\"; in [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] script represented by the [[cross potent]] \u2629),{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=257, Vol. I}} ''Ti\u0101n'' refers to the northern [[celestial pole]] ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u6975}} ''B\u011bij\u00ed''), the pivot and the vault of the sky with its spinning constellations.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim''}} Here is an approximate representation of the ''Ti\u0101nm\u00e9n'' {{lang|zh|\u5929\u9580}} (\"Gate of Heaven\")<ref>{{cite book|last=Reiter|first=Florian C.|title=Purposes, Means and Convictions in Daoism: A Berlin Symposium|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2007|isbn=978-3447055130}} p. 190.</ref> or ''Ti\u0101nsh\u016b'' {{lang|zh|\u5929\u6a1e}} (\"Pivot of Heaven\")<ref>{{cite book|last=Milburn|first=Olivia|title=The Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Yan|series=Sinica Leidensia|publisher=BRILL|year=2016|isbn=978-9004309661}} p. 343, note 17.</ref> as the precessional north celestial pole, with [[Polaris|\u03b1 Ursae Minoris]] as the [[pole star]], with the spinning [[Big Dipper|Chariot]] constellations in the four phases of time.

Creation is therefore a continuous ordering; it is not a creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''.

He argues that the [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries of the 16th century]] selected Confucius from many possible sages to serve as the counterpart to Christ or Muhammad in order to meet European religion categories. They used a variety of writings by Confucius and his followers to coin a new \"-ism\"\u2014\"Confucianism\"\u2014which they presented as a \"rationalist secular-ethical code\", not as a religion. This secular understanding of Confucianism inspired both the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe in the 18th century, and Chinese intellectuals of the 20th century. [[Liang Shuming]], a philosopher of the [[May Fourth Movement]], wrote that Confucianism \"functioned as a religion without actually being one\". Western scholarship generally accepted this understanding. In the decades following the Second World War, however, many Chinese intellectuals and academic scholars in the West, among whom [[Tu Weiming]], reversed this assessment. Confucianism, for this new generation of scholars, became a \"true religion\" that offered \"immanent transcendence\".<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Alitto|editor-first=Guy|editor-link=Guy Alitto| title=Contemporary Confucianism in Thought and Action|year=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3662477502}} pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Herbert Fingarette]]'s conceptualisation of Confucianism as a religion which proposes \"the [[secularity|secular]] as [[sacred]]\",{{sfnb|Fingarette|1972}} Confucianism transcends the dichotomy between religion and humanism.

Confucianism originated during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and developed [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[cosmology|cosmological]] elements in the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE\u2013220 CE),{{sfnb|Craig|1998|p=550}} to match the developments in Buddhism and Taoism which were dominant among the populace. By the same period, Confucianism became the core idea of Chinese imperial politics. According to He Guanghu, Confucianism may be identified as a continuation of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]]-[[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (~1600 BCE\u2013256 BCE) official religion, or the Chinese aboriginal religion which has lasted uninterrupted for three thousand years.{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=105, note 45}}\n\nBy the words of [[Tu Weiming]] and other Confucian scholars who recover the work of [[Kang Youwei]] (a Confucian reformer of the early 20th century), Confucianism revolves around the pursuit of the unity of the individual self and Heaven, or, otherwise said, around the relationship between humanity and Heaven.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} The principle of Heaven (''Li'' or ''Dao'') is the order of the creation and the source of divine authority, [[monism|monistic]] in its structure.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} Individuals may realise their humanity and become one with Heaven through the contemplation of this order.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} This transformation of the self may be extended to the family and society to create a harmonious fiduciary community.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} Confucianism conciliates both the inner and outer polarities of spiritual cultivation, that is to say self-cultivation and world redemption, synthesised in the ideal of \"sageliness within and kingliness without\".{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} As defined by Stephan Feuchtwang, Heaven is thought to have an ordering law which preserves the world, which has to be followed by humanity by means of a \"middle way\" between yin and yang forces; social harmony or morality is identified as patriarchy, which is the worship of ancestors and progenitors in the male line, in ancestral shrines.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}\n\nIn Confucian thought, human beings are always teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor of self-cultivation and self-creation. Some of the basic Confucian ethical and practical concepts include ''r\u00e9n'', ''y\u00ec'', ''l\u01d0'', and ''zh\u00ec''. [[Ren (Confucianism)|''Ren'']] is translated as \"humaneness\", or the essence proper of a human being, which is characterised by compassionate mind; it is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time what allows man to achieve oneness with Heaven\u2014in the ''Datong shu'' it is defined as \"to form one body with all things\" and \"when the self and others are not separated ... compassion is aroused\".{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}} [[Yi (Confucianism)|''Yi'']] is \"righteousness\", which consists in the ability to always maintain a moral disposition to do good things. [[Li (Confucianism)|''Li'']] is a system of ritual norms and propriety of behaviour which determine how a person should act in everyday life. ''Zhi'' is the ability to see what is right and what is wrong, in the behaviour exhibited by others.

They share elements that go back to the 4th century BCE and to the prehistoric culture of China, such as the [[School of Naturalists|School of Yin and Yang]] and the thought of [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]. Taoism has a distinct scriptural tradition, with the ''[[Tao Te Ching|D\u00e0od\u00e9j\u012bng]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u9053\u5fb7\u7ecf}} \"Book of the Way and its Virtue\") of Laozi being regarded as its keystone. Taoism may be described, as does the scholar and Taoist initiate [[Kristofer Schipper]] in ''The Taoist Body'' (1986), as a doctrinal and liturgical framework or structure for developing the local cults of indigenous religion.<ref name=\"Wu2014\"/> Taoist traditions emphasise living in harmony with the ''[[Tao]]'' ([[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanised as ''Dao'']]). The term ''Tao'' means \"way\", \"path\" or \"principle\", and may also be found in Chinese philosophies and religions other than Taoism, including Confucian thought. In Taoism, however, ''Tao'' denotes the principle that is both the source and the pattern of development of everything that exists. It is ultimately [[ineffability|ineffable]]: \"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao\" says the first verse of the Tao Te Ching.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tao Te Ching|translator-last=Kohn|translator-first=Livia|year=1993}}</ref> According to the scholar Stephan Feuchtwang, the concept of ''Tao'' is equivalent to the ancient Greek concept of ''[[physis]]'', \"nature\", that is the vision of the process of generation and regeneration of things and of the moral order.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}\n\nBy the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE\u2013220 CE) the various sources of Taoism coalesced into a coherent tradition of religious organisations and orders of ritualists. In earlier China, Taoists were thought of as hermits or ascetics who did not participate in political life. Zhuangzi was the best known of them, and it is significant that he lived in the south, where he was involved in local [[shamanism|shamanic]] traditions.{{sfnb|Nadeau|2012|p=42}} Women shamans played an important role in this tradition, which was particularly strong in the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Early Taoist movements developed their own institution in contrast to shamanism, but absorbing fundamental shamanic elements. Shamans revealed texts of Taoism from early times down to at least the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Despeux|first=Catherine|chapter=Women in Daoism|title=Daoism Handbook|editor-last=Kohn|editor-first=Livia|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|date=2000|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXVk1tr6lEYC}} pp. 403\u2013404.</ref>\n\nTaoist institutional orders evolved in strains that in recent times are conventionally grouped in two main branches: [[Quanzhen Taoism]] and [[Zhengyi Taoism]].{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}} Taoist schools traditionally feature reverence for Laozi, [[xian (Taoism)|immortals]] or ancestors, along with a variety of rituals for [[divination]] and [[exorcism]], and techniques for achieving [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]], longevity or immortality. Ethics and appropriate behaviour may vary depending on the particular school, but in general all emphasise ''[[wu wei]]'' (effortless action), \"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]: compassion, moderation, and humility.\n\nTaoism has had profound influence on Chinese culture over the course of the centuries, and Taoists ({{zh|c=\u9053\u58eb|p=d\u00e0oshi}}, \"masters of the Tao\") usually take care to mark the distinction between their ritual tradition and those of [[Chinese ritual mastery traditions|vernacular orders]] which are not recognised as Taoist.\n\nTaoism was suppressed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s and early 1970s but its traditions endured in secrecy and revived in following decades. In 1956 a national organisation, the [[Chinese Taoist Association]], was established to govern the activity of Taoist orders and temples. According to [[religion in China#Demographics|demographic analyses]], approximately 13% of the population of China claims a loose affiliation with Taoist practices, while self-proclaimed \"Taoists\" (a title traditionally attributed only to the ''daoshi'', i.e. the priests, who are experts of Taoist doctrines and rites, and to their closest disciples) might be 12 million (~1%).<ref name=\"CSLS2010\"/> The definition of \"Taoist\" is complicated by the fact that many [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk sects of salvation]] and their members began to be registered as branches of the Taoist association in the 1990s.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=347}}\n\nThere are two types of Taoists, following the distinction between the Quanzhen and Zhengyi traditions.{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}} Quanzhen ''daoshi'' are celibate [[monk]]s, and therefore the [[Taoist temple]]s of the Quanzhen school are monasteries.{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}} Contrarywise, Zhengyi ''daoshi'', also known as ''sanju daoshi'' (\"scattered\" or \"diffused\" Taoists) or ''huoju daoshi'' (Taoists \"who live at home\"), are [[priest]]s who may marry and have other jobs besides the sacerdotal office; they live among the population and perform Taoist rituals within common Chinese religion, for local temples and communities.{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}}\n\nWhile the Chinese Taoist Association started as a Quanzhen institution, and remains based at the [[White Cloud Temple]] of Beijing, that also functions as the headquarters of the Quanzhen sects, from the 1990s onwards it started to open registration to the ''sanju daoshi'' of the Zhengyi branch, who are more numerous than the Quanzhen monks. The Chinese Taoist Association had already 20.000 registered ''sanju daoshi'' in the mid-1990s,{{sfnb|Overmyer|2003|p=118}} while the total number of Zhengyi priests including the unregistered ones was estimated at 200.000 in the same years.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=332}} The Zhengyi ''sanju daoshi'' are trained by other priests of the same sect, and historically received formal ordination by the [[Celestial Master]],{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}}{{sfnb|Pas|1998|p=259}} although the 63rd Celestial Master Zhang Enpu fled to Taiwan in the 1940s during the Chinese Civil War.

The arrival of the Persian missionary [[Alopen]] in 635, during the early period of the [[Tang dynasty]], is considered by some to be the first entry of Christianity in China. What Westerners referred to as [[Nestorianism]] flourished for centuries, until [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] of the Tang in 845 ordained that all foreign religions (Buddhism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism) had to be eradicated from the Chinese nation. Christianity was reintroduced in China in the 13th century, in the form of Nestorianism, during the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], which also established relations with the [[papacy]], especially through [[Franciscan]] missionaries in 1294. When the native Han Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] overthrew the Yuan dynasty in the 14th century, Christianity was again expelled from China as a foreign influence.\n\nAt the end of the Ming dynasty in the 16th century, [[Jesuit]]s arrived in Beijing via [[Guangzhou]]. The most famous amongst them was [[Matteo Ricci]], an Italian mathematician who came to China in 1588 and lived in Beijing. Ricci was welcomed at the imperial court and introduced Western learning into China. The Jesuits followed a policy of adaptation of Catholicism to traditional Chinese religious practices, especially ancestor worship. However, such practices were eventually condemned as polytheistic idolatry by the popes [[Pope Clement XI|Clement XI]], [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII]] and [[Pope Benedict XIV|Benedict XIV]]. Roman Catholic missions struggled in obscurity for decades afterwards.\n\nChristianity began to take root in a significant way in the late imperial period, during the [[Qing dynasty]], and although it has remained a minority religion in China, it influenced late imperial history. Waves of missionaries came to China in the Qing period as a result of contact with foreign powers. [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] was introduced in 1715, and [[Protestant missions in China|Protestant missions]] began entering China in 1807. The pace of missionary activity increased considerably after the [[First Opium War]] in 1842. Christian missionaries and their schools, under the protection of the Western powers, went on to play a major role in the [[Westernisation]] of China in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850\u20131871) was influenced to some degree by Christian teachings, and the [[Boxer Rebellion]] (1899\u20131901) was in part a reaction against Christianity in China.

Worship of [[Mithra]] was indeed performed at the court of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (157-87 BCE).<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|149}}\n\nThe first phase of Zoroastrianism in China started in the [[Northern Wei|Wei]] and [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] dynasties of the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]]' period (220\u2013589), when Sogdian Zoroastrians advanced into China. They did not proselytise among Chinese, and from this period there are only two known fragments of Zoroastrian literature, both in [[Sogdian language]]. One of them is a translation of the ''[[Ashem Vohu]]'' recovered by Aurel Stein in Dunhuang and now preserved at the [[British Museum]]. The Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) prohibited Chinese people to profess Zoroastrianism, so it remained primarily a religion of foreign residents. Before the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (756\u2013763), Sogdians and Chinese lived as segregated ethnic groups; however, after the rebellion intermarriage became common and the Sogdians were gradually assimilated by the Chinese.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|150}}\n\nIn addition to the Sogdian Zoroastrians, after the fall of the [[Sasanid dynasty]] (651), through the 7th and 8th centuries [[Iran]]ian Zoroastrians, including aristocrats and ''[[magi]]'',<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|151}} migrated to northern China.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|148}} Fleeing the [[Islamization of Iran|Islamisation of Iran]], they settled in the cities of [[Chang'an]], [[Luoyang]], [[Kaifeng]], [[Yangzhou]], [[Taiyuan]] and elsewhere.{{sfnb|Ching|1993|p=171}} In the Tang period it is attested that there were at least twenty-nine Zoroastrian [[fire temple]]s in northern urban centres.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|150}} During the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|great purge of foreign religions]] under Emperor Wuzong of Tang also Zoroastrianism was target of suppression.\n\nThe second phase of Zoroastrianism in China was in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] (907\u2013960), and saw the development of an indigenous Chinese Zoroastrianism that lasted until modern times. During this period, the gods of Sogdian Zoroastrianism were assimilated into the [[Chinese folk religion]]; Zoroastrian currents of the Chinese folk religion were increasingly practised by the Chinese and survived until the 1940s.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|149}} Chinese Zoroastrian temples were witnessed to be active in [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]], [[Hubei]] until those years.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|153}}\n\nThe third phase started in the 18th century when [[Parsi]] merchants sailed from [[Mumbai]] to [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Guangzhou]]. Parsi cemeteries and fire temples were built in these coastal cities, in east China. The Parsis were expelled when the Communist Party of China rose to power in 1949.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|149}} A Parsi fire temple was built in [[Shanghai]] in 1866, and was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|154}} Starting in the 1980s there has been a new wave of Parsis settling in China.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|155}}\n\nIn [[Classical Chinese]], Zoroastrianism was first referred to as {{lang|zh|\u80e1\u5929}} ''H\u00fati\u0101n'', which in the Wei-Jin period became the appellation of all northern nomads. In the early Tang, a new character was invented specifically for Zoroastrianism, {{lang|zh|\u7946}} ''xi\u0101n'', meaning the \"worship of Heaven\". Curiously, in the Far East the Zoroastrians were regarded as \"Heaven worshippers\" rather than \"fire worshippers\" (in Japanese the name of the religion is ''Kenky\u014d'', the same as in Chinese).

In the early twenty-first century there has been increasing official recognition of [[Confucianism]] and [[Chinese folk religion]] as part of [[Culture of China|China's cultural inheritance]].\n\nFolk or popular religion, the most widespread system of beliefs and practices, has evolved and adapted since at least the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties in the second millennium BCE. Fundamental elements of a [[Chinese theology|theology and spiritual explanation]] for the nature of the universe harken back to this period and were further elaborated in the [[Axial Age]]. Basically, Chinese religion involves allegiance to the ''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'', often translated as \"spirits\", defining a variety of [[Chinese gods and immortals|gods and immortals]].

Mediatory individuals such as shamans communicated prayers, sacrifices or offerings directly to the spiritual world, a heritage that survives in some modern forms of Chinese religion.{{sfnb|Yang|Lang|2012|p=112}}\n\nAncient shamanism is especially connected to ancient Neolithic cultures such as the [[Hongshan culture]].<ref>{{cite article|last1=Nelson|first1=Sarah M.|last2=Matson|first2=Rachel A.|last3=Roberts|first3=Rachel M.|last4=Rock|first4=Chris|last5=Stencel|first5=Robert E.|title=Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang|year=2006}}</ref> The Flemish philosopher [[Ulrich Libbrecht]] traces the origins of some features of Taoism to what [[Jan Jakob Maria de Groot]] called \"Wuism\",{{sfnb|De Groot|1892|loc=''passim'' Vol. 6}} that is Chinese shamanism.{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}}\n\nLibbrecht distinguishes two layers in the development of the [[Chinese theology]] and religion that continues to this day, traditions derived respectively from the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] (1600\u20131046 BCE) and subsequent [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties (1046\u2013256 BCE). The religion of the Shang was based on the worship of ancestors and god-kings, who survived as unseen divine forces after death. They were not transcendent entities, since the universe was \"by itself so\", not created by a force outside of it but generated by internal rhythms and cosmic powers. The royal ancestors were called ''di'' ({{lang|zh|\u5e1d}}), \"deities\", and the utmost progenitor was ''[[Shangdi]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u5e1d}} \"Highest Deity\"). Shangdi is identified with the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], symbol of the unlimited power (''[[qi]]''),{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} of the \"protean\" primordial power which embodies [[yin and yang]] in unity, associated to the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] which winds around the north [[orbital pole|ecliptic pole]],{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|p=55}} and slithers between the [[Ursa Minor|Little]] and [[Big Dipper]] (or Great Chariot). Already in Shang theology, the multiplicity of gods of nature and ancestors were viewed as parts of Di, and the four {{lang|zh|\u65b9}} ''[[Wufang Shangdi|f\u0101ng]]'' (\"directions\" or \"sides\") and their {{lang|zh|\u98a8}} ''f\u0113ng'' (\"winds\") as his [[cosmos|cosmic]] will.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=143\u2013144, Vol. II}}\n\nThe Zhou dynasty, which overthrew the Shang, was more rooted in an [[agriculture|agricultural]] worldview, and they emphasised a more universal idea of ''[[Tian]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u5929}} \"Heaven\").{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} The Shang dynasty's identification of Shangdi as their ancestor-god had asserted their claim to power by divine right; the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power, the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. In Zhou theology, Tian had no singular earthly progeny, but bestowed divine favour on virtuous rulers. Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people, while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by Tian.{{sfnb|Fung|2008|p=163}}\n\nJohn C.

Confucius saw an opportunity to reinforce values of compassion and tradition into society. Disillusioned with the widespread vulgarisation of the rituals to access Tian, he began to preach an ethical interpretation of traditional Zhou religion. In his view, the power of Tian is immanent, and responds positively to the sincere heart driven by humaneness and rightness, decency and altruism. Confucius conceived these qualities as the foundation needed to restore socio-political harmony. Like many contemporaries, Confucius saw ritual practices as efficacious ways to access Tian, but he thought that the crucial knot was the state of [[meditation]] that participants enter prior to engage in the ritual acts.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=xxxviii, Vol. I}} Confucius amended and recodified the [[Chinese classics|classical books]] inherited from the Xia-Shang-Zhou dynasties, and composed the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''.{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=1}}\n\nPhilosophers in the Warring States compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', and formulated the classical metaphysics which became the lash of Confucianism. In accordance with the Master, they identified mental tranquility as the state of Tian, or the One (\u4e00 ''Y\u012b''), which in each individual is the Heaven-bestowed divine power to rule one's own life and the world. Going beyond the Master, they theorised the oneness of production and reabsorption into the cosmic source, and the possibility to understand and therefore reattain it through meditation. This line of thought would have influenced all Chinese individual and collective-political mystical theories and practices thereafter.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxviii\u2013xxxix, Vol. I}}\n\nAccording to [[Zhou Youguang]], Confucianism's name in Chinese, basically {{lang|zh|\u5112}} ''r\u00fa'', originally referred to shamanic methods of holding rites and existed before Confucius' times, but with Confucius it came to mean devotion to propagating such teachings to bring civilisation to the people. Confucianism was initiated by Confucius, developed by [[Mencius]] (~372\u2013289 BCE) and inherited by later generations, undergoing constant transformations and restructuring since its establishment, but preserving the principles of humaneness and righteousness at its core.{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=1}}\n\n===Qin and Han dynasties===\n[[File:Tai'an Dai Miao 2015.08.13 10-17-53.jpg|thumb|250px|Main hall of the Dai Temple ({{lang|zh|\u5cb1\u5e99}} ''D\u00e0imi\u00e0o'') at [[Mount Tai]].

It was in this period that religious focus shifted to the [[Di (Chinese concept)|Earth]] ({{lang|zh|\u5730}} ''D\u00ec''), regarded as representative of Heaven's (celestial pole's) power. In the Han period, the philosophical concern was especially the crucial role of the human being on earth, completing the cosmological trinity of Heaven-Earth-humanity ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u5730\u4eba}} ''Ti\u0101nd\u00ecr\u00e9n'').

The idea of the incarnation of God was not new, as already the Shang royal lineage regarded themselves as divine.

This was also true for royal ancestors of the early Zhou dynasty.{{sfnb|Zhou|2005|pp=7\u20138}} The difference rests upon the fact that the Yellow Emperor was no longer an exclusive ancestor of some royal lineage, but rather a more universal archetype of the human being.

Prospects for a better personal life and salvation appealed to the masses who were periodically hit by natural disasters and galvanised by uprisings organised by self-proclaimed \"kings\" and \"heirs\". In such harsh conditions, while the imperial cult continued the sacrifices to the cosmological gods, common people estranged from the rationalism of the state religion found solace in enlightened masters and in reviving and perpetuating more or less abandoned cults of national, regional and local divinities that better represented indigenous identities. The Han state religion itself was \"ethnicised\" by associating the cosmological deities to regional populations.{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nBy the end of the dynasty (206 BCE\u20138 CE) the earliest record of a mass religious movement attests the excitement provoked by the belief in the imminent advent of the [[Queen Mother of the West]] ({{lang|zh|\u897f\u738b\u6bcd}} ''X\u012bw\u00e1ngm\u01d4'') in the northeastern provinces (then [[Henan]], [[Hebei]] and [[Shandong]]) in the first half of the year 3 BCE.

During a military mission in Hanning (modern southwest [[Shaanxi]]), Xiu either died in battle or was killed by Lu himself, who incorporated Xiu's followers and seized the city, which he renamed [[Hanzhong]]. A characteristic of the territory governed by Lu was its significant non-Chinese population.

After the first stage of the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220\u2013280), China was partially unified under the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)]], while much of the north was governed by [[Sixteen Kingdoms|sixteen independent states]]. The fall of the Han capital [[Luoyang]] to the [[Xiongnu]] in 311 led the royal court and Celestial Masters' clerics to migrate southwards. [[Jiangnan]] became the center of the \"southern tradition\" of Celestial Masters' Taoism, which developed characteristic features, among which a meditation technique known as \"guarding the One\" (''shouyi''), that is visualising the unity God in the human organism.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2016}}{{rp|3.2}}\n\nRepresentatives of Jiangnan's indigenous religions responded to the spread of Celestial Masters' Taoism by reformulating their own traditions according to the imported religion. This led to the foundation of two new Taoist schools, with their own scriptural and ritual bodies: [[Shangqing Taoism]] ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u6e05\u6d3e}} ''Sh\u00e0ngq\u012bngp\u00e0i'', \"Highest Clarity school\"), based on revelations that occurred between 364 and 370 in modern-day [[Nanjing]], and [[Lingbao Taoism]] ({{lang|zh|\u7075\u5b9d\u6d3e}} ''L\u00edngb\u01ceop\u00e0i'', \"Numinous Gem school\"), based on revelations of the years between 397 and 402 and recodified later by Lu Xiujing (406-77). Lingbao incorporated from Buddhism the ideas of \"universal salvation\" and ranked \"heavens\", and focused on communal rituals.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2016}}{{rp|3.3}}\n\nBuddhism brought a model of afterlife to Chinese people and had a deep influence on Chinese culture. The story ''[[Mulian Rescues His Mother]]'', for instance, is a parable dated back to the 3rd century, which adapts an originally Buddhist fable to show Confucian values of filial piety. In the story, a virtuous monk descends into hell to rescue his mother, who had been condemned for her transgressions.{{sfnb|Teiser|1988|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n===Sui and Tang dynasties===\nIn the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) the concept of \"Tian\" became more common at the expense of \"Di\", continuing a tendency that started in the Han dynasty. Both also expanded their meanings, with \"di\" now more frequently used as suffix of a deity's name rather than to refer to the supreme power. \"Tian\", besides, became more associated to its meaning of \"[[Heaven]]\" as a [[paradise]] or the hierarchy of physical skies. The proliferation of foreign religions in the Tang, especially Buddhist sects, entailed that each of them conceived their own ideal \"Heaven\". \"Tian\" itself started to be used, linguistically, as an affix in composite names to mean \"heavenly\" or \"divine\". This was also the case in the Buddhist context, with many monasteries' names containing this element.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nUnder the influence of foreign cultures and thought systems, new concepts to refer to the supreme God were formulated, such as ''Ti\u0101nzh\u014dngti\u0101n'' ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u4e2d\u5929}} \"God of the Gods\"), seemingly introduced by [[Yuezhi]] Buddhist missionaries to render the [[Sanskrit]] ''Dev\u0101tideva'' (of the same meaning) or ''[[Bhagavan|Bhagav\u0101n]]'' from their Iranian sources.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|p=38}}\n\nBoth Buddhism and Taoism developed hierarchic pantheons which merged metaphysical (celestial) and physical (terrestrial) being, blurring the edge between the human and the divine, which reinforced the religious belief that gods and devotees sustain one another.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|p=42}}\n\n====The cult of the City Gods====\n[[File:The Temple of the Town Deity in Sheng County 44 2017-03.jpg|thumb|250px|Temple of the City God of [[Sheng County]], [[Zhejiang]].

This pattern continues today with former village Communist Party secretaries elected as temple association bosses (p. 83). He concludes (p. 92): \"In sum, since at least the early twentieth century the majority of local ritual leaders in north China have been products of their own or nearby communities.

These sects were more active in some communities than in others, but in principle were open to all who responded to these leaders and believed in their efficacy and teachings, so some of these groups spread to wide areas of the country. [...] significant for us here though is evidence for the residual influence of sectarian beliefs and practices on non-sectarian community religion where the sects no longer exist, particularly the feminization of deities by adding to their names the characters ''mu'' or ''Laomu'', Mother or Venerable Mother, as in ''Guanyin Laomu'', ''Puxianmu'', ''Dizangmu'', etc., based on the name of the chief sectarian deity, ''Wusheng Laomu'', the Eternal Venerable Mother. ''Puxian'' and ''Dizang'' are bodhisattvas normally considered 'male', though in Buddhist theory such gender categories don\u2019t really apply.

The performance of rites ({{lang|zh|\u793c}} ''l\u01d0'') is the key characteristic of common Chinese religion, which scholars see as going back to Neolithic times. According to the scholar [[Stephan Feuchtwang]], rites are conceived as \"what makes the invisible visible\", making possible for humans to cultivate the underlying order of nature. Correctly performed rituals move society in alignment with earthly and heavenly (astral) forces, establishing the harmony of the three realms\u2014Heaven, Earth and humanity. This practice is defined as \"centring\" ({{lang|zh|\u592e}} ''y\u0101ng'' or {{lang|zh|\u4e2d}} ''zh\u014dng''). Rituals may be performed by government officials, family elders, popular ritual masters and Taoists, the latter cultivating local gods to centre the forces of the universe upon a particular locality. Among all things of creation, humans themselves are \"central\" because they have the ability to cultivate and centre natural forces.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=150}}\n\nThis primordial sense of ritual united the moral and the religious and drew no boundaries between family, social, and political life. From earliest times, the Chinese tended to be all-embracing rather than to treat different religious traditions as separate and independent. The scholar [[Xinzhong Yao]] argues that the term \"Chinese religion\", therefore, does not imply that there is only one religious system, but that the \"different ways of believing and practicing... are rooted in and can be defined by culturally common themes and features\", and that \"different religious streams and strands have formed a culturally unitary single tradition\" in which basic concepts and practices are related.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe continuity of Chinese civilisation across thousands of years and thousands of square miles is made possible through China's religious traditions understood as systems of knowledge transmission.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=17}} A worthy Chinese is supposed to remember a vast amount of information from the past, and to draw on this past to form his moral reasoning.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=17}} The remembrance of the past and of ancestors is important for individuals and groups. The identities of descent-based groups are molded by stories, written genealogies (''[[zupu]]'', \"books of ancestors\"), temple activities, and village theatre which link them to history.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=18}}\n\nThis reliance on group memory is the foundation of the Chinese practice of [[Chinese ancestor worship|ancestor worship]] ({{lang|zh|\u62dc\u7956}} ''b\u00e0iz\u01d4'' or {{lang|zh|\u656c\u7956}} ''j\u00ecngz\u01d4'') which dates back to prehistory, and is the focal aspect of Chinese religion.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=18}} Defined as \"the essential religion of the Chinese\", ancestor worship is the means of memory and therefore of the cultural vitality of the entire Chinese civilisation.{{sfnb|Yang|1961|p=53}} Rites, symbols, objects and ideas construct and transmit group and individual identities.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|pp=144\u2013153}} Rituals and sacrifices are employed not only to seek blessing from the ancestors, but also to create a communal and educational religious environment in which people are firmly linked with a glorified history. Ancestors are evoked as gods and kept alive in these ceremonies to bring good luck and protect from evil forces and [[ghosts in Chinese culture|ghosts]].{{sfnb|Yao|2010|pp=114, 177}}\n\nThe two major festivals involving ancestor worship are the [[Qingming Festival]] and the [[Double Ninth Festival]], but veneration of ancestors is held in many other ceremonies, including [[Chinese marriage|weddings]], funerals, and [[triad (underground society)|triad]] initiations. Worshippers generally offer prayers through a ''[[jingxiang]]'' rite, with offerings of food, light [[incense]] and candles, and burning [[joss paper]]. These activities are typically conducted at the site of ancestral graves or tombs, at an ancestral temple, or at a household shrine.\n\nA practice developed in the Chinese folk religion of post-Maoist China, that started in the 1990s from the [[Temple of Confucius|Confucian temples]] managed by the Kong kin (the lineage of the descendants of Confucius himself), is the representation of ancestors in [[ancestral shrine]]s no longer just through tablets with their names, but through statues. Statuary effigies were previously exclusively used for Buddhist bodhisattva and Taoist gods.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n[[Chinese lineage associations|Lineage cults]] of the founders of [[Chinese surname|surname]]s and [[Chinese kin|kins]] are religious microcosms which are part of a larger organism, that is the cults of the ancestor-gods of regional and ethnic groups, which in turn are part of a further macrocosm, the cults of virtuous historical figures that have had an important impact in the history of China, notable examples including [[Confucius]], [[Guan Yu|Guandi]], or [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]], [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]] and [[Chiyou]], the latter three considered ancestor-gods of the [[Han Chinese]] (Huangdi and Yandi) and of western minority ethnicities and foreigners (Chiyou). This hierarchy proceeds up to the gods of the cosmos, the [[Di (Chinese concept)|Earth]] and [[Tian|Heaven]] itself. In other words, ancestors are regarded as the equivalent of Heaven within human society,{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=76\u201377}} and are therefore the means connecting back to Heaven as the \"utmost ancestral father\" ({{lang|zh|\u66fe\u7956\u7236}} ''z\u0113ngz\u01d4f\u00f9'').{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=84, note 282}}\n\n===Theological and cosmological discourse===\n[[File:Precessional north pole (B\u011bij\u00ed \u5317\u6781) in \u03b1 Ursae Minoris, drawing a w\u00e0n \u534d in the four phases of time.svg|thumb|300px|Like other symbols such as the ''[[swastika]]'',{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=256, Vol. III}} ''w\u00e0n'' {{lang|zh|\u534d}} (\"myriad things\") in Chinese, the [[Mesopotamia]]n \ud808\udc2d ''[[Dingir]]''/''[[Anu|An]]'' (\"Heaven\"),<ref name=Mair2011/> and also the Chinese {{lang|zh|\u5deb}} ''[[wu (shaman)|w\u016b]]'' (\"shaman\"; in [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] script represented by the [[cross potent]] \u2629),{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=257, Vol. I}} ''Ti\u0101n'' refers to the northern [[celestial pole]] ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u6975}} ''B\u011bij\u00ed''), the pivot and the vault of the sky with its spinning constellations.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim''}} Here is an approximate representation of the ''Ti\u0101nm\u00e9n'' {{lang|zh|\u5929\u9580}} (\"Gate of Heaven\")<ref>{{cite book|last=Reiter|first=Florian C.|title=Purposes, Means and Convictions in Daoism: A Berlin Symposium|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2007|isbn=978-3447055130}} p. 190.</ref> or ''Ti\u0101nsh\u016b'' {{lang|zh|\u5929\u6a1e}} (\"Pivot of Heaven\")<ref>{{cite book|last=Milburn|first=Olivia|title=The Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Yan|series=Sinica Leidensia|publisher=BRILL|year=2016|isbn=978-9004309661}} p. 343, note 17.</ref> as the precessional north celestial pole, with [[Polaris|\u03b1 Ursae Minoris]] as the [[pole star]], with the spinning [[Big Dipper|Chariot]] constellations in the four phases of time.

Creation is therefore a continuous ordering; it is not a creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''.

He argues that the [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries of the 16th century]] selected Confucius from many possible sages to serve as the counterpart to Christ or Muhammad in order to meet European religion categories. They used a variety of writings by Confucius and his followers to coin a new \"-ism\"\u2014\"Confucianism\"\u2014which they presented as a \"rationalist secular-ethical code\", not as a religion. This secular understanding of Confucianism inspired both the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe in the 18th century, and Chinese intellectuals of the 20th century. [[Liang Shuming]], a philosopher of the [[May Fourth Movement]], wrote that Confucianism \"functioned as a religion without actually being one\". Western scholarship generally accepted this understanding. In the decades following the Second World War, however, many Chinese intellectuals and academic scholars in the West, among whom [[Tu Weiming]], reversed this assessment. Confucianism, for this new generation of scholars, became a \"true religion\" that offered \"immanent transcendence\".<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Alitto|editor-first=Guy|editor-link=Guy Alitto| title=Contemporary Confucianism in Thought and Action|year=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3662477502}} pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Herbert Fingarette]]'s conceptualisation of Confucianism as a religion which proposes \"the [[secularity|secular]] as [[sacred]]\",{{sfnb|Fingarette|1972}} Confucianism transcends the dichotomy between religion and humanism.

Confucianism originated during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and developed [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[cosmology|cosmological]] elements in the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE\u2013220 CE),{{sfnb|Craig|1998|p=550}} to match the developments in Buddhism and Taoism which were dominant among the populace. By the same period, Confucianism became the core idea of Chinese imperial politics. According to He Guanghu, Confucianism may be identified as a continuation of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]]-[[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (~1600 BCE\u2013256 BCE) official religion, or the Chinese aboriginal religion which has lasted uninterrupted for three thousand years.{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=105, note 45}}\n\nBy the words of [[Tu Weiming]] and other Confucian scholars who recover the work of [[Kang Youwei]] (a Confucian reformer of the early 20th century), Confucianism revolves around the pursuit of the unity of the individual self and Heaven, or, otherwise said, around the relationship between humanity and Heaven.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} The principle of Heaven (''Li'' or ''Dao'') is the order of the creation and the source of divine authority, [[monism|monistic]] in its structure.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} Individuals may realise their humanity and become one with Heaven through the contemplation of this order.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} This transformation of the self may be extended to the family and society to create a harmonious fiduciary community.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} Confucianism conciliates both the inner and outer polarities of spiritual cultivation, that is to say self-cultivation and world redemption, synthesised in the ideal of \"sageliness within and kingliness without\".{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} As defined by Stephan Feuchtwang, Heaven is thought to have an ordering law which preserves the world, which has to be followed by humanity by means of a \"middle way\" between yin and yang forces; social harmony or morality is identified as patriarchy, which is the worship of ancestors and progenitors in the male line, in ancestral shrines.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}\n\nIn Confucian thought, human beings are always teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor of self-cultivation and self-creation. Some of the basic Confucian ethical and practical concepts include ''r\u00e9n'', ''y\u00ec'', ''l\u01d0'', and ''zh\u00ec''. [[Ren (Confucianism)|''Ren'']] is translated as \"humaneness\", or the essence proper of a human being, which is characterised by compassionate mind; it is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time what allows man to achieve oneness with Heaven\u2014in the ''Datong shu'' it is defined as \"to form one body with all things\" and \"when the self and others are not separated ... compassion is aroused\".{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}} [[Yi (Confucianism)|''Yi'']] is \"righteousness\", which consists in the ability to always maintain a moral disposition to do good things. [[Li (Confucianism)|''Li'']] is a system of ritual norms and propriety of behaviour which determine how a person should act in everyday life. ''Zhi'' is the ability to see what is right and what is wrong, in the behaviour exhibited by others.

They share elements that go back to the 4th century BCE and to the prehistoric culture of China, such as the [[School of Naturalists|School of Yin and Yang]] and the thought of [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]. Taoism has a distinct scriptural tradition, with the ''[[Tao Te Ching|D\u00e0od\u00e9j\u012bng]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u9053\u5fb7\u7ecf}} \"Book of the Way and its Virtue\") of Laozi being regarded as its keystone. Taoism may be described, as does the scholar and Taoist initiate [[Kristofer Schipper]] in ''The Taoist Body'' (1986), as a doctrinal and liturgical framework or structure for developing the local cults of indigenous religion.<ref name=\"Wu2014\"/> Taoist traditions emphasise living in harmony with the ''[[Tao]]'' ([[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanised as ''Dao'']]). The term ''Tao'' means \"way\", \"path\" or \"principle\", and may also be found in Chinese philosophies and religions other than Taoism, including Confucian thought. In Taoism, however, ''Tao'' denotes the principle that is both the source and the pattern of development of everything that exists. It is ultimately [[ineffability|ineffable]]: \"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao\" says the first verse of the Tao Te Ching.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tao Te Ching|translator-last=Kohn|translator-first=Livia|year=1993}}</ref> According to the scholar Stephan Feuchtwang, the concept of ''Tao'' is equivalent to the ancient Greek concept of ''[[physis]]'', \"nature\", that is the vision of the process of generation and regeneration of things and of the moral order.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}\n\nBy the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE\u2013220 CE) the various sources of Taoism coalesced into a coherent tradition of religious organisations and orders of ritualists. In earlier China, Taoists were thought of as hermits or ascetics who did not participate in political life. Zhuangzi was the best known of them, and it is significant that he lived in the south, where he was involved in local [[shamanism|shamanic]] traditions.{{sfnb|Nadeau|2012|p=42}} Women shamans played an important role in this tradition, which was particularly strong in the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Early Taoist movements developed their own institution in contrast to shamanism, but absorbing fundamental shamanic elements. Shamans revealed texts of Taoism from early times down to at least the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Despeux|first=Catherine|chapter=Women in Daoism|title=Daoism Handbook|editor-last=Kohn|editor-first=Livia|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|date=2000|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXVk1tr6lEYC}} pp. 403\u2013404.</ref>\n\nTaoist institutional orders evolved in strains that in recent times are conventionally grouped in two main branches: [[Quanzhen Taoism]] and [[Zhengyi Taoism]].{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}} Taoist schools traditionally feature reverence for Laozi, [[xian (Taoism)|immortals]] or ancestors, along with a variety of rituals for [[divination]] and [[exorcism]], and techniques for achieving [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]], longevity or immortality. Ethics and appropriate behaviour may vary depending on the particular school, but in general all emphasise ''[[wu wei]]'' (effortless action), \"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]: compassion, moderation, and humility.\n\nTaoism has had profound influence on Chinese culture over the course of the centuries, and Taoists ({{zh|c=\u9053\u58eb|p=d\u00e0oshi}}, \"masters of the Tao\") usually take care to mark the distinction between their ritual tradition and those of [[Chinese ritual mastery traditions|vernacular orders]] which are not recognised as Taoist.\n\nTaoism was suppressed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s and early 1970s but its traditions endured in secrecy and revived in following decades. In 1956 a national organisation, the [[Chinese Taoist Association]], was established to govern the activity of Taoist orders and temples. According to [[religion in China#Demographics|demographic analyses]], approximately 13% of the population of China claims a loose affiliation with Taoist practices, while self-proclaimed \"Taoists\" (a title traditionally attributed only to the ''daoshi'', i.e. the priests, who are experts of Taoist doctrines and rites, and to their closest disciples) might be 12 million (~1%).<ref name=\"CSLS2010\"/> The definition of \"Taoist\" is complicated by the fact that many [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk sects of salvation]] and their members began to be registered as branches of the Taoist association in the 1990s.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=347}}\n\nThere are two types of Taoists, following the distinction between the Quanzhen and Zhengyi traditions.{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}} Quanzhen ''daoshi'' are celibate [[monk]]s, and therefore the [[Taoist temple]]s of the Quanzhen school are monasteries.{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}} Contrarywise, Zhengyi ''daoshi'', also known as ''sanju daoshi'' (\"scattered\" or \"diffused\" Taoists) or ''huoju daoshi'' (Taoists \"who live at home\"), are [[priest]]s who may marry and have other jobs besides the sacerdotal office; they live among the population and perform Taoist rituals within common Chinese religion, for local temples and communities.{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}}\n\nWhile the Chinese Taoist Association started as a Quanzhen institution, and remains based at the [[White Cloud Temple]] of Beijing, that also functions as the headquarters of the Quanzhen sects, from the 1990s onwards it started to open registration to the ''sanju daoshi'' of the Zhengyi branch, who are more numerous than the Quanzhen monks. The Chinese Taoist Association had already 20.000 registered ''sanju daoshi'' in the mid-1990s,{{sfnb|Overmyer|2003|p=118}} while the total number of Zhengyi priests including the unregistered ones was estimated at 200.000 in the same years.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=332}} The Zhengyi ''sanju daoshi'' are trained by other priests of the same sect, and historically received formal ordination by the [[Celestial Master]],{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}}{{sfnb|Pas|1998|p=259}} although the 63rd Celestial Master Zhang Enpu fled to Taiwan in the 1940s during the Chinese Civil War.

The arrival of the Persian missionary [[Alopen]] in 635, during the early period of the [[Tang dynasty]], is considered by some to be the first entry of Christianity in China. What Westerners referred to as [[Nestorianism]] flourished for centuries, until [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] of the Tang in 845 ordained that all foreign religions (Buddhism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism) had to be eradicated from the Chinese nation. Christianity was reintroduced in China in the 13th century, in the form of Nestorianism, during the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], which also established relations with the [[papacy]], especially through [[Franciscan]] missionaries in 1294. When the native Han Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] overthrew the Yuan dynasty in the 14th century, Christianity was again expelled from China as a foreign influence.\n\nAt the end of the Ming dynasty in the 16th century, [[Jesuit]]s arrived in Beijing via [[Guangzhou]]. The most famous amongst them was [[Matteo Ricci]], an Italian mathematician who came to China in 1588 and lived in Beijing. Ricci was welcomed at the imperial court and introduced Western learning into China. The Jesuits followed a policy of adaptation of Catholicism to traditional Chinese religious practices, especially ancestor worship. However, such practices were eventually condemned as polytheistic idolatry by the popes [[Pope Clement XI|Clement XI]], [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII]] and [[Pope Benedict XIV|Benedict XIV]]. Roman Catholic missions struggled in obscurity for decades afterwards.\n\nChristianity began to take root in a significant way in the late imperial period, during the [[Qing dynasty]], and although it has remained a minority religion in China, it influenced late imperial history. Waves of missionaries came to China in the Qing period as a result of contact with foreign powers. [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] was introduced in 1715, and [[Protestant missions in China|Protestant missions]] began entering China in 1807. The pace of missionary activity increased considerably after the [[First Opium War]] in 1842. Christian missionaries and their schools, under the protection of the Western powers, went on to play a major role in the [[Westernisation]] of China in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850\u20131871) was influenced to some degree by Christian teachings, and the [[Boxer Rebellion]] (1899\u20131901) was in part a reaction against Christianity in China.

Worship of [[Mithra]] was indeed performed at the court of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (157-87 BCE).<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|149}}\n\nThe first phase of Zoroastrianism in China started in the [[Northern Wei|Wei]] and [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] dynasties of the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]]' period (220\u2013589), when Sogdian Zoroastrians advanced into China. They did not proselytise among Chinese, and from this period there are only two known fragments of Zoroastrian literature, both in [[Sogdian language]]. One of them is a translation of the ''[[Ashem Vohu]]'' recovered by Aurel Stein in Dunhuang and now preserved at the [[British Museum]]. The Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) prohibited Chinese people to profess Zoroastrianism, so it remained primarily a religion of foreign residents. Before the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (756\u2013763), Sogdians and Chinese lived as segregated ethnic groups; however, after the rebellion intermarriage became common and the Sogdians were gradually assimilated by the Chinese.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|150}}\n\nIn addition to the Sogdian Zoroastrians, after the fall of the [[Sasanid dynasty]] (651), through the 7th and 8th centuries [[Iran]]ian Zoroastrians, including aristocrats and ''[[magi]]'',<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|151}} migrated to northern China.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|148}} Fleeing the [[Islamization of Iran|Islamisation of Iran]], they settled in the cities of [[Chang'an]], [[Luoyang]], [[Kaifeng]], [[Yangzhou]], [[Taiyuan]] and elsewhere.{{sfnb|Ching|1993|p=171}} In the Tang period it is attested that there were at least twenty-nine Zoroastrian [[fire temple]]s in northern urban centres.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|150}} During the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|great purge of foreign religions]] under Emperor Wuzong of Tang also Zoroastrianism was target of suppression.\n\nThe second phase of Zoroastrianism in China was in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] (907\u2013960), and saw the development of an indigenous Chinese Zoroastrianism that lasted until modern times. During this period, the gods of Sogdian Zoroastrianism were assimilated into the [[Chinese folk religion]]; Zoroastrian currents of the Chinese folk religion were increasingly practised by the Chinese and survived until the 1940s.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|149}} Chinese Zoroastrian temples were witnessed to be active in [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]], [[Hubei]] until those years.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|153}}\n\nThe third phase started in the 18th century when [[Parsi]] merchants sailed from [[Mumbai]] to [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Guangzhou]]. Parsi cemeteries and fire temples were built in these coastal cities, in east China. The Parsis were expelled when the Communist Party of China rose to power in 1949.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|149}} A Parsi fire temple was built in [[Shanghai]] in 1866, and was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|154}} Starting in the 1980s there has been a new wave of Parsis settling in China.<ref name=StausbergVevaina/>{{rp|155}}\n\nIn [[Classical Chinese]], Zoroastrianism was first referred to as {{lang|zh|\u80e1\u5929}} ''H\u00fati\u0101n'', which in the Wei-Jin period became the appellation of all northern nomads. In the early Tang, a new character was invented specifically for Zoroastrianism, {{lang|zh|\u7946}} ''xi\u0101n'', meaning the \"worship of Heaven\". Curiously, in the Far East the Zoroastrians were regarded as \"Heaven worshippers\" rather than \"fire worshippers\" (in Japanese the name of the religion is ''Kenky\u014d'', the same as in Chinese).

Frank Baum]] (president), [[Louis F. Gottschalk]] (vice president), Harry Marston Haldeman (secretary), and Clarence R. Rundel (treasurer) as an offshoot of Haldeman's social group, [[The Uplifters (club)|The Uplifters]], that met at the [[Los Angeles Athletic Club]].  Its goal was to produce quality family-oriented entertainment in a time when children were primarily seeing violent [[Westerns]].  It was a critical but not a commercial success; even under a name change to [[Dramatic Feature Films]], it was quickly forced to fold.  The studio made only five features and five short films, of which four features (in part) and no shorts survive. Founded in 1914, it was absorbed by [[Metro Pictures]], which evolved into [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].\n\nThe company is best known for three of its films that survive, albeit with missing footage, today:  ''[[The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914 film)|The Patchwork Girl of Oz]]'', ''[[The Magic Cloak of Oz]]'', and ''[[His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz]]''.\n\n==Studio==\nThe studio was located on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] between [[Gower Street (Hollywood)|Gower Street]] and Lodi Street.  The facility would later be used by [[Famous Players-Lasky]] (now called [[Paramount Pictures]]) and National Film Corporation of America.  It was considered state-of-the-art at the time.  It was used almost exclusively for interior shots.  Exterior shots were done outdoors rather than simulated in the studio.\n\n==Stock company==\n[[J. Farrell MacDonald]] directed all of the film productions and acted in some of them.  [[L. Frank Baum]] wrote all the scripts, and [[Louis F. Gottschalk]] wrote complete original [[Film score|score]]s that were sent out with the films, at time when improvising stock cues from the repertoire was common.  James A. Crosby was the studio [[cinematographer]], and Will H. White was the technical director.  The records do not show who was responsible for [[film editing]].\n\nAmong the major players at the company were [[Violet MacMillan]], [[Frank Moore (American actor)|Frank Moore]], [[Pierre Couderc]], [[Juanita Hansen]], Mai Wells, [[Raymond Russell (actor)|Raymond Russell]], Todd Wright, [[Vivian Reed (silent film actress)|Vivian Reed]], and [[J. Charles Haydon]], with animals portrayed by [[Fred Woodward (actor)|Fred Woodward]], who had appeared in the stage version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' back in 1902.  A newcomer on the second project, [[Mildred Harris]], would become more famous for her marriage to [[Charles Chaplin]].  Another member of the company was [[Richard Rosson (filmmaker)|Richard Rosson]], whose younger brother, [[Harold Rosson]], would go on to shoot ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).\n\n==Distribution==\n''The Patchwork Girl of Oz'' was accepted onto the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] distribution program, but when the picture fared poorly, Paramount refused to take on the additional productions.  The remaining films were finally accepted onto the Alliance program.  ''The Magic Cloak of Oz'' was not released until 1917.  The prints currently circulating are based on two two-reelers of a British release, known as ''The Magic Cloak'' and ''The Witch Queen'', and are missing a reel of material.\n\n==Logo==\n\nThe ident for the Oz Film Manufacturing Company showed a smiling [[Princess Ozma]] head staring into the camera, portrayed by [[Vivian Reed (silent film actress)|Vivian Reed]]. This logo is often considered to be scary and unsettling by many, due to the fact that all the logo features is a floating head on a black background, especially considering some idents feature her face almost covering the entire screen. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.penbaypilot.com/article/farnsworth-collective-presents-wizard-oz-trivia-night/27105|title=Farnsworth Collective presents \u2018Wizard of Oz\u2019 trivia night|date=January 2014|work=PenBay Pilot|accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n''The Patchwork Girl of Oz'' was released in early September, ''The Magic Cloak of Oz'' ready by late September, and ''His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz'' was screened in October but did not get distribution.  The Alliance program released a fourth feature, ''[[The Last Egyptian]]'', from an exotic [[orientalism|orientalist]] adventure novel that Baum had written but declined authorship credit for commercial reasons, in early December.  The studio claimed to be going strong well into the next year, but released only short subjects, and the held-up ''His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz'', retitled ''The New Wizard of Oz'' to capitalize on the popularity of the stage play well-remembered from the previous decade.\n\n==Short subjects==\nLost from the company are a series of four short subjects titled ''Violet's Dreams'', which starred Violet MacMillan and Fred Woodward.  This was the whole of the company's new output in 1915 prior to the name change.\n\n#''A Box of Bandits'' (based on Baum's short story, \"The Box of Robbers\" from ''[[American Fairy Tales]]'')\n#''The Country Circus''\n#''The Magic Bon Bons'' (based on Baum's short story, \"The Magic Bon-Bons\" [punctuation sic], also from ''American Fairy Tales''\n#''In Dreamy Jungleland'' (working title: \"The Jungle\") [Note:  Alan Goble's ''International Film Index'' cites this title as ''In Dreamy Jungletown'' with MacMillan as director, though there seems little evidence for either claim.]\n\nEach of these films depicted Violet's interaction with animals (played by Woodward), and magical opportunities to do things she is otherwise not allowed to do, such as visit a country circus prohibited to her because of her [[gender]].\n\nGeorge Cochrane produced a film in 1917 based on these materials titled ''Like Babes in the Woods''.  This film should not be confused with ''The Babes in the Woods'', an adaptation of the [[Hansel and Gretel]] story made by [[Chester Franklin]] and [[Sidney Franklin (director)|Sidney Franklin]], also from 1917.  ''The Babes in the Woods'' has been released on [[videocassette]]; ''Like Babes in the Woods'' is a [[lost film]].\n\n==Decline==\nThe studio was rented out to others, and was eventually demolished. Unlike the case with ''[[The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays]]'' (1908), Baum invested none of his own money in the venture and was not financially affected by the studio's failure, though it is probable it impacted his health, which took a turn for the worse not long after the failure.\n\n[[Frank Joslyn Baum]], Baum's eldest son and sometime attorney, who handled East Coast distribution from an office in [[Times Square]], took over the company and renamed it [[Dramatic Feature Films]], which made one feature and one short, probably from scripts by the younger Baum. Although ads announced the release of the feature film, ''[[The Gray Nun of Belgium]]'', it does not appear to actually have been released. While some speculate that Baum would have allied himself with [[United Artists]] had he been able to sustain the company, there is no evidence for this, nor evidence that he had ever met UA's founding members, Charles Chaplin, [[Mary Pickford]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], and [[D. W. Griffith]], though Gottschalk went on to work with all of them. It is known that fairy tale/fantasy films were produced more frequently by 1917.\n\nThe four feature films were considered lost for many years. By the 1980s, all three fairy tale films were made available on home video. All of the feature films have been released on both DVD and VHS with the exception of ''The Last Egyptian''.  [[The Museum of Modern Art]] owns a worn copy that was used in [[Bill Morrison (director)|Bill Morrison]]'s ''[[Decasia]]'', but it remains unreleased and is not part of their screening repertoire.  The shorts remain lost.\n\n==In fiction==\nIn L. Frank Baum's pseudonymous novel, ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces Out West]]'', the series' principals are introduced to a filmmaker named Otis Werner, who is clearly a send-up of [[Otis Turner]], who made some earlier Oz films, mostly without Baum's input.  The nieces decide to establish their own film company for children, and Uncle John name-drops \"[[Hans Christian Andersen|Hans Andersen]], Frank Baum, and [[Lewis Carroll]]\" as among those whose fairy tales had already been adapted to the screen.  The novel was written during the midst of the company's existence and published before the company's fall, and ends before the girls actually do establish such a company.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Bibliography==\n*\"The Oz Film Manufacturing Company\" (in three parts) by Richard Mills and David L.

Throughout the history of the program, nearly 63,000 undergraduate students<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/contact/about-us/|title=About us|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=|df=}}</ref> from more than 1,500 colleges and universities have participated in Semester at Sea.\n\nDuring the spring and fall semesters, up to 600 undergraduates<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/life-at-sea/our-ship/|title=Our Ship|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Semester at Sea|accessdate=|df=}}</ref> participate in the program, which is approximately 100-110 days. During this semester, the ship circumnavigates the globe, travelling from [[North America]] and heading either east across the [[Atlantic]] or west across the [[Pacific]], visiting 10 to 11 countries in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[South America]], and [[North America]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey {{!}} Semester at Sea|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> Previously, the program had voyages that would sail through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, but due to piracy concerns in the [[Gulf of Aden]], voyages now typically travel around Africa.\n\nFor many years, ISE hosted a shorter 65-day Semester at Sea program in the summer that focused on one general region of the world. In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea decided to cancel short-term voyages indefinitely due to low enrolment. Additionally, a two-week ''\"Enrichment Voyage\"'' program was previously held for continuing education participants during December and January. Itineraries for these voyages focused on [[Central America]] and [[South America]], often transiting the [[Panama Canal]] or traveling up the [[Amazon River]]. Currently, ISE only offers fall and spring voyages.\n\n== Academics ==\nStudents attend classes on a variety of subjects and disciplines while the ship is at sea. Typically, these classes include [[humanities]] classes that are relevant to one or more of the countries on the itinerary. All students are also required to take an interdisciplinary core course, called [[Global studies|Global Studies.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215223032/https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-12-15|title=Course Information|format=PDF}}</ref> While in port, no classes are held and students can travel on Semester at Sea sponsored trips or independently in the country,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/in-country/|title=In-country destinations: field classes & program {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> however, travel outside the country of a port is strictly prohibited, resulting in the student's dismissal from the program.\n\nAlthough [[Colorado State University]] is the academic sponsor for the program, Semester at Sea is open to students from any university. Faculty members are drawn from colleges and universities throughout the United States and around the world, including [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[George Washington University]], [[Boston University]], [[Bucknell University]], [[Emerson College]], [[Yale University]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[California Lutheran University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Bentley University]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Duke University]], [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)]], [[Cornell University]], [[Jacksonville University]], [[University of Arizona]], [[University of Michigan]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Virginia]], [[University of Colorado]], [[University of Maine]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Southern California]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[New York University]], and [[Columbia University]].\n\nBefore arriving at a port, students receive a pre-port briefing regarding the culture and societal rules of the country they are visiting. Upon arrival at the port of call, special guest speakers, ranging from community leaders from the country to American ambassadors, give lectures to the students and faculty. The pre-port briefing and the guest lectures are intended to help prepare students for their time in the country.\n\n== Notable lecturers and guests<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/experts/|title=Faculty & Staff - your expert education team {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> ==\n*[[Fidel Castro]], Cuban President\n*[[Anwar Sadat]], Egyptian President\n*[[Indira Gandhi]], Indian Prime Minister\n*[[Mikhail Gorbachev]], USSR President\n*[[Corazon Aquino]], President of the Philippines\n*[[King Mohammed VI of Morocco]], King of Morocco\n*[[Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco]], Prince of Morocco\n*[[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Mother Teresa]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Nelson Mandela]], First Black President of South Africa, Nobel Laureate\n*[[Arthur C.

Students are transformed from \"[[pollywog]]s\" to \"shellbacks\" in an initiation ceremony, involving slime-smearing, fish-kissing, and (optional) [[head shaving|head-shaving]]. Neptune Day is one of several holidays celebrated during the voyage.\n\n=== Sea Olympics ===\nStudents aboard the ship are divided into groups named for various seas, (occasionally including [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Bering Sea|Bering]], [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Red Sea|Red]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Three Seas Initiative|Three Seas]], (for the Lifelong Learners, faculty, and children of faculty). \n\nThe student seas are generally determined by their deck and will participate in an all-day Olympic challenge. Opening ceremonies are held in the morning, and no classes are held during the challenge. Events may include synchronized swimming, pull-ups, dodgeball, trivia, a lip-sync routine, and a ship-wide relay. The teams compete for the opportunity to disembark the ship first in its final port of call as well as a celebration in the faculty/staff-only lounge.\n\n==Notable Alumni==\n*[[Joan Lunden]], F67 \u2013 TV Host\n*[[Joel Douglas]], F67 \u2013 Film Producer \u2013 ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]]''\n*[[Stephen Gaghan]], F86 \u2013 Emmy and Oscar Winning Screenwriter, ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''\n*[[Cynthia Nixon]], S86 \u2013 Emmy Winning Actress \u2013 \"Miranda\" on TV show ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and challenged Andrew Cuomo<ref>[[Andrew Cuomo]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} in the 2018 New York Gubernatorial Election.\n*[[Richard Lamm]], S91 \u2013 Former Governor of [[Colorado]]\n*[[Arthur C.

However, the ship was unable to consistently meet its sailing schedule during the semester due to persistent mechanical difficulties. The ship made several unscheduled stops and had to anchor between ports while repairs were accomplished. It was decided to tow the ship to the [[South China Sea]] and anchor overnight. Captain Chang had all crew members patrolling the deck 3\u20135 feet apart with flashlights throughout the night to notify of any pirate boarding attempts. The planned stop at [[Manila|Manila, Philippines]] was canceled and the SS ''Universe'' rerouted to Singapore. Exams completed at anchor in the harbor, then the students and faculty flew to the next two planned ports of Osaka, Japan, and Shanghai, China. The ''Universe'' then met the students in Shanghai to complete the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.\n\nTraveling in foreign countries poses risks for all travellers and a few incidents of non-shipboard fatalities have occurred to participants of Semester at Sea. One student died in a hiking accident on a 1993 voyage, and SaS Spring 1996, five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India.<ref>Hong, Peter (1996) \u201cDeaths Cloud Floating College : After Losing Children to Accidents, Parents Say Risks Weren't Publicized; Officials Defend Program\u201d,  http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/me-15911_1_international-programs.  Accessed 2011-06-30</ref>\n\nThe Fall 1997 voyage was rerouted due to [[terrorism]] concerns. On November 12, 1997, [[Ramzi Yousef]] was convicted of masterminding the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Consequently, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. On November 17, 1997, while the ship was docked in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], and the students were in [[Egypt]], the [[Luxor massacre]] occurred. Although no students were involved, fears of further terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports, [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]], from the itinerary, and the ship was rerouted to [[Cyprus]] and then [[Spain]].\n\nThe Fall 2000 semester on the SS ''Universe Explorer'' had two incidents. When entering Vietnam, the ship was hit by a barge, causing damage to the hull along the side of the ship and closing student rooms. No one was injured by this incident. The SS ''Universe Explorer'' had to remain an extra day in Vietnam to be patched but subsequently continued on the journey with all passengers. While preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship's captain decided to reroute due to threats against all ships in the Suez region. Instead, the Fall 2000 voyage stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nIn the Fall 2001 semester following the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the SS ''Universe Explorer'' was redirected after its stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The planned route \u2014 from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], into the [[Indian Ocean]] through the [[Suez Canal]] to ports in [[Egypt]] and [[Croatia]] \u2014 was changed by the U.S. State Department. The ship's route for the semester was then rerouted south to include [[Singapore]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship's communication with other vessels in the Indian Ocean was limited to protect the security of the American citizens on board.\n\nOn January 26, 2005, the MV ''Explorer'' weathered a combination of three storms in the [[North Pacific]], and a {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} [[Rogue wave|freak wave]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k#t=8m42s|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}</ref> smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them, and briefly affecting the navigation systems.

The students on board the MV ''World Odyssey'' were rerouted to Vietnam where students received an extra week to make up for lost time in China. The MV ''World Odyssey'' left [[Kobe]], Japan, as scheduled on January 28, 2020, with arrival in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]], on February 4, 2020. The ship was expected to have left [[Ho Chi Minh City]] at 0800 local time on February 16 but left 3 hours later at 1100 local time. The original itinerary had the MV ''World Odyssey'' stopping in Malaysia from February 19 to February 24 before heading to India from February 29 to March 5. Following a one-day fuel stop in Malaysia on February 19, the MV ''World Odyssey'' attempted to reroute to [[Victoria, Seychelles]] (with arrival expected on February 27 and departure on March 1). However, the evening before arrival, the Seychellois government denied the vessel entry. The MV ''World Odyssey'' then headed directly south to Mauritius and docked on February 29. The ship spent one day at port, followed by two days at sea around the island due to limited dock availability. The ship then returned to dock in [[Port Louis]] March 3\u20137. At about 0715 on March 6, students were informed of another itinerary change due to concerns of [[quarantine]] when arriving at European ports from northern Africa.

In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea decided to cancel short-term voyages indefinitely due to low enrolment. Additionally, a two-week ''\"Enrichment Voyage\"'' program was previously held for continuing education participants during December and January. Itineraries for these voyages focused on [[Central America]] and [[South America]], often transiting the [[Panama Canal]] or traveling up the [[Amazon River]]. Currently, ISE only offers fall and spring voyages.\n\n== Academics ==\nStudents attend classes on a variety of subjects and disciplines while the ship is at sea. Typically, these classes include [[humanities]] classes that are relevant to one or more of the countries on the itinerary. All students are also required to take an interdisciplinary core course, called [[Global studies|Global Studies.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215223032/https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-12-15|title=Course Information|format=PDF}}</ref> While in port, no classes are held and students can travel on Semester at Sea sponsored trips or independently in the country,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/in-country/|title=In-country destinations: field classes & program {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> however, travel outside the country of a port is strictly prohibited, resulting in the student's dismissal from the program.\n\nAlthough [[Colorado State University]] is the academic sponsor for the program, Semester at Sea is open to students from any university.

Upon arrival at the port of call, special guest speakers, ranging from community leaders from the country to American ambassadors, give lectures to the students and faculty. The pre-port briefing and the guest lectures are intended to help prepare students for their time in the country.\n\n== Notable lecturers and guests<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/experts/|title=Faculty & Staff - your expert education team {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> ==\n*[[Fidel Castro]], Cuban President\n*[[Anwar Sadat]], Egyptian President\n*[[Indira Gandhi]], Indian Prime Minister\n*[[Mikhail Gorbachev]], USSR President\n*[[Corazon Aquino]], President of the Philippines\n*[[King Mohammed VI of Morocco]], King of Morocco\n*[[Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco]], Prince of Morocco\n*[[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Mother Teresa]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Nelson Mandela]], First Black President of South Africa, Nobel Laureate\n*[[Arthur C.

In Fall 2019, Semester at Sea embarked on a new voyage that included ports such as the Netherlands, [[Poland]], the [[Kiel Canal]] Transit, [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Croatia]], Morocco, Ghana, [[Brazil]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Panama Canal]] Transit, [[Ecuador]], and [[Costa Rica]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey|website=Semester At Sea|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n \nThe ship docked in [[Denmark]] during Summer 2008,<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Semester at Sea \u2013 Summer 2008 Itinerary/Calendar\n |url         = http://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/current-voyage/itinerary.php\n |accessdate  = 2008-07-08\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703042836/http://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/current-voyage/itinerary.php\n |archivedate = 2008-07-03\n}}</ref> [[Namibia]] during Fall 2008, [[Bulgaria]] during Summer 2009, and [[Senegal]] during Fall 2015, the first time in the history of the program that Semester at Sea had visited these countries.\n\n== Traditions ==\n=== Neptune Day celebration ===\nWhen the ship crosses the equator, the students, faculty and crew of the vessel celebrate [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] Day, a maritime [[line-crossing ceremony]]. Students are transformed from \"[[pollywog]]s\" to \"shellbacks\" in an initiation ceremony, involving slime-smearing, fish-kissing, and (optional) [[head shaving|head-shaving]]. Neptune Day is one of several holidays celebrated during the voyage.\n\n=== Sea Olympics ===\nStudents aboard the ship are divided into groups named for various seas, (occasionally including [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Bering Sea|Bering]], [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Red Sea|Red]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Three Seas Initiative|Three Seas]], (for the Lifelong Learners, faculty, and children of faculty). \n\nThe student seas are generally determined by their deck and will participate in an all-day Olympic challenge. Opening ceremonies are held in the morning, and no classes are held during the challenge. Events may include synchronized swimming, pull-ups, dodgeball, trivia, a lip-sync routine, and a ship-wide relay. The teams compete for the opportunity to disembark the ship first in its final port of call as well as a celebration in the faculty/staff-only lounge.\n\n==Notable Alumni==\n*[[Joan Lunden]], F67 \u2013 TV Host\n*[[Joel Douglas]], F67 \u2013 Film Producer \u2013 ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]]''\n*[[Stephen Gaghan]], F86 \u2013 Emmy and Oscar Winning Screenwriter, ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''\n*[[Cynthia Nixon]], S86 \u2013 Emmy Winning Actress \u2013 \"Miranda\" on TV show ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and challenged Andrew Cuomo<ref>[[Andrew Cuomo]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} in the 2018 New York Gubernatorial Election.\n*[[Richard Lamm]], S91 \u2013 Former Governor of [[Colorado]]\n*[[Arthur C.

However, the ship was unable to consistently meet its sailing schedule during the semester due to persistent mechanical difficulties. The ship made several unscheduled stops and had to anchor between ports while repairs were accomplished. It was decided to tow the ship to the [[South China Sea]] and anchor overnight. Captain Chang had all crew members patrolling the deck 3\u20135 feet apart with flashlights throughout the night to notify of any pirate boarding attempts. The planned stop at [[Manila|Manila, Philippines]] was canceled and the SS ''Universe'' rerouted to Singapore. Exams completed at anchor in the harbor, then the students and faculty flew to the next two planned ports of Osaka, Japan, and Shanghai, China. The ''Universe'' then met the students in Shanghai to complete the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.\n\nTraveling in foreign countries poses risks for all travellers and a few incidents of non-shipboard fatalities have occurred to participants of Semester at Sea. One student died in a hiking accident on a 1993 voyage, and SaS Spring 1996, five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India.<ref>Hong, Peter (1996) \u201cDeaths Cloud Floating College : After Losing Children to Accidents, Parents Say Risks Weren't Publicized; Officials Defend Program\u201d,  http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/me-15911_1_international-programs.  Accessed 2011-06-30</ref>\n\nThe Fall 1997 voyage was rerouted due to [[terrorism]] concerns. On November 12, 1997, [[Ramzi Yousef]] was convicted of masterminding the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Consequently, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. On November 17, 1997, while the ship was docked in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], and the students were in [[Egypt]], the [[Luxor massacre]] occurred. Although no students were involved, fears of further terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports, [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]], from the itinerary, and the ship was rerouted to [[Cyprus]] and then [[Spain]].\n\nThe Fall 2000 semester on the SS ''Universe Explorer'' had two incidents. When entering Vietnam, the ship was hit by a barge, causing damage to the hull along the side of the ship and closing student rooms. No one was injured by this incident. The SS ''Universe Explorer'' had to remain an extra day in Vietnam to be patched but subsequently continued on the journey with all passengers. While preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship's captain decided to reroute due to threats against all ships in the Suez region. Instead, the Fall 2000 voyage stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nIn the Fall 2001 semester following the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the SS ''Universe Explorer'' was redirected after its stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The planned route \u2014 from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], into the [[Indian Ocean]] through the [[Suez Canal]] to ports in [[Egypt]] and [[Croatia]] \u2014 was changed by the U.S. State Department. The ship's route for the semester was then rerouted south to include [[Singapore]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship's communication with other vessels in the Indian Ocean was limited to protect the security of the American citizens on board.\n\nOn January 26, 2005, the MV ''Explorer'' weathered a combination of three storms in the [[North Pacific]], and a {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} [[Rogue wave|freak wave]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k#t=8m42s|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}</ref> smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them, and briefly affecting the navigation systems.

The MV ''World Odyssey'' left [[Kobe]], Japan, as scheduled on January 28, 2020, with arrival in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]], on February 4, 2020. The ship was expected to have left [[Ho Chi Minh City]] at 0800 local time on February 16 but left 3 hours later at 1100 local time. The original itinerary had the MV ''World Odyssey'' stopping in Malaysia from February 19 to February 24 before heading to India from February 29 to March 5. Following a one-day fuel stop in Malaysia on February 19, the MV ''World Odyssey'' attempted to reroute to [[Victoria, Seychelles]] (with arrival expected on February 27 and departure on March 1). However, the evening before arrival, the Seychellois government denied the vessel entry. The MV ''World Odyssey'' then headed directly south to Mauritius and docked on February 29. The ship spent one day at port, followed by two days at sea around the island due to limited dock availability. The ship then returned to dock in [[Port Louis]] March 3\u20137. At about 0715 on March 6, students were informed of another itinerary change due to concerns of [[quarantine]] when arriving at European ports from northern Africa.

{"title_page": "Margit Kaffka", "text_new": "{{eastern name order|Kaffka Margit}}\n[[Image:Kaffka Margit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Margit Kaffka]]\n\n'''Margit Kaffka''' (10 June 1880 \u2013 1 December 1918) was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] writer and poet.\n\nCalled a \"great, great writer\" by [[Endre Ady]], she was one of the most important female Hungarian authors, and an important member of the [[Nyugat]] generation. Her writing was inspired by [[J\u00f3zsef Kiss (poet)|J\u00f3zsef Kiss]], [[Mih\u00e1ly Szabolcska]], and the writers' group of the periodical ''H\u00e9t''.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nMargit Kaffka was born on 10 June 1880 in [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]] (today [[Carei]], [[Romania]]) into a family of minor Hungarian nobility (see her family's genealogy in ''[https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/clcweblibrary/totosyrecords  Records of the T\u00f6t\u00f6sy de Zepetnek Family]''). Her father was a [[public prosecutor]], but died early and the family lived under reduced circumstances. She received a scholarship to study at the [[Sisters of Mercy]] teacher's training college in [[Szatm\u00e1r]] and in return she taught for one year in [[Miskolc]]. She studied in [[Budapest]], receiving a teacher's diploma from the Erzs\u00e9bet Girls' School. She returned to Miskolc, where she taught literature and economics in a private girls' school, beloved by students. This is the period when her first writings, poems, and novels appeared.  She subsequently became a full-time contributor to ''[[Nyugat]]'', the most important periodical of the era.\n\nShe married Br\u00fan\u00f3 Fr\u00f6hlich, a forestry officer, on 17 February 1905. In 1907 her husband moved to the Ministry of Agriculture, enabling Kaffka to move away from Miskolc, a town she did not like. However, their marriage became stressed after a few years, and ended in a divorce.  Kaffka worked as a teacher in Budapest between 1910\u20131915.  During this time, she published her best known work, ''Sz\u00ednek \u00e9s \u00e9vek'' (1912) (Colors and Years). She married for the second time in 1914 to [[Ervin Bauer]], the younger brother of [[B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs]]. At the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]] she left her teaching job to focus full-time on her literary work. She died in the [[1918 flu pandemic]] along with her young son.\n\n== Literature ==\n\nHer works dealt mostly with two main themes: the fall of the [[gentry]], and the physical and spiritual hardships of the independent women in the start of the 20th century. She often wrote about her personal memories of great national crises, the glaring oppositions of the anachronistic society in Hungary.\n\nHer literary career can be divided into three chapters, from 1901 to the start of ''Nyugat'' in 1908, the second ending in the start of the war in 1918, and the third marked by the hard years after the war ending in her death.\n\n1912 marked the release of her first, and most important novel, ''Sz\u00ednek \u00e9s \u00c9vek'' (''Colours and Years'') dealing with the fate of the gentry class and women. Her second most famed work is ''Hangyaboly'' (''The Ant Heap'') collecting her memories from the years at Sisters of Mercy was published in 1917.\n[[File:Kaffka Margit 2012.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Margit Kaffka at Budapest]]\n\n== Major works ==\n\n*''Versek'' (1903)\n*''Levelek a z\u00e1rd\u00e1b\u00f3l'' (diary novel, 1904)\n*''A gondolkod\u00f3k \u00e9s egy\u00e9b elbesz\u00e9l\u00e9sek'' (narratives, 1906)\n*''Csendes v\u00e1ls\u00e1gok'' (narratives, 1909)\n*''K\u00e9pzelet-kir\u00e1lyfiak'' (mesereg\u00e9ny, 1909)\n*''Csendes v\u00e1ls\u00e1gok'' (narratives, 1910)\n*''Csonka reg\u00e9ny \u00e9s novell\u00e1k'' (narratives, 1911)\n*''Tall\u00f3z\u00f3 \u00e9vek'' (poems, 1911)\n*''Utolszor a lyr\u00e1n'' (poems, 1912)\n*''S\u00fcpped\u0151 talajon'' (narratives, 1912)\n*''Sz\u00ednek \u00e9s \u00e9vek'' (''Colours and Years'') (novel, 1912)\n*''M\u00e1ria \u00e9vei'' (novel, 1913)\n*''Szent Ildefonso b\u00e1lja'' (narratives, 1914)\n*''K\u00e9t ny\u00e1r'' (novel, 1916)\n*''\u00c1llom\u00e1sok'' (novel, 1917)\n*''Hangyaboly'' (''The Ant Heap'') (novel, 1917)\n*''Kis emberek bar\u00e1tocsk\u00e1im'' (collection of early works, 1918)\n*''Az \u00e9let \u00fatj\u00e1n'' (poems, 1918)\n*''A r\u00e9vn\u00e9l'' (narratives, 1918)\n\n== Sources ==\n* Czig\u00e1ny, L\u00f3r\u00e1nt. \"Women in Revolt: Margit Kaffka.\" ''The Oxford History of Hungarian Literature''.

Together with Ravnsborggade, its continuation to the south, it forms the backbone of a small neighbourhood bounded by [[The Lakes, Copenhagen|The Lakes]] to the east, Blegdamsvej to the west, [[N\u00f8rrebrogade]] to the south and [[\u00d8sterbrogade]] to the north. The busy artery Fredensgade and the adjacent Fredens Park, effectively separates the N\u00f8rrebro and \u00d8sterbro portions of Ryesgade from each other.

The plans for the new street was first presented in around 1860 as part of the plans for redevelopment of the area. It served the dual purpose of dividing the long lots in two and in the same time to facilitate the construction of a new main sewer along the lakes.\n\nThe street and its side streets were named for military figures from Denmark's most recent wars, [[First Schleswig War]] (1949&ndash;50) and [[Second Schleswig War]]  (1864). Ryesgade takes its name after [[Olaf Rye]]. The side streets are named after Hans Hedemann (Hedemannsgade), Hans Hedemann (Helgesensgade), Niels Christian Lunding (Lundingsgade), Johan Trepka  (Trepkasgade), Johan Irminger  (Irmingersgade),Christoph von Krogh (Kroghsgade(,Frederik L\u00e6ss\u00f8e (L\u00e6ss\u00f8esgade) and Frederik Adolph Schleppegrell (Schleppegrellsgade).\n\n===Early development, 1860-1900===\n[[File:Ryesgade set fra N\u00f8rrebro med Huset, der skal nedbrydes for Gadens udvidelse.png|thumb|The southern cul-de-sac seen from N\u00f8rrebrogade on a drawing by Lydvig Both, 1994]]\nThe street was constructed in stages with its last section, around Irmingersgade, not being constructed until the 1880s. For many years it was therefore made up of two dead end sections, accessed from the south and north respectively.\n\n[[File:Bryggeriet Ravnsborg.jpg|thumb|left|Ravnsborg Brewery]]\nThe first development along the street was a mixture of industrial and residential buildings. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/teater/gasvaerket|title=Gasv\u00e6rket|publisher=AOK|accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref> Harald Drewsen designed a villa for [[Andreas Aagesen]] at No. 46.

N\u00f8rrebros Iisv\u00e6rk, an industrial producer of ice, was located at No. 50. [[Camillus Nyrop]]'s  factory (No. 105) producedmedical instruments. Schulstad & Ludvigsen operated an industrial bakery in the street. [[NKT A/S|Nordiske Kabel- og Traadfabrikker]] opened at No. 105 in 1893 but moved to La Cours Cej in [[Frederiksberg]] in 1906.\n\nThe entertainment venue Sortedamslund was also located in the street.\n\n===20th century===\nOn 1 June 1983 squatters moved into No. 58.  No. 63&ndash;65 was also squatted on 4 December 1985 and cleared by the police on 11 February 1986. The situation culminated in the [[Battle of Ryesgade|Ryesgade Riots]] which occurred in mid-September. The squatters ultimately left No. 58 on 22 September.\n\n==Notable buildings and residents==\n===Ravnsborggade to Fredensgade===\n[[Image:Nordisk Metalvarefabrik.JPG|thumb|No. 3: The former metal goods factory ]] \nA number of the old industrial buildings are still found in the N\u00f8rrebro section of the street.

The wing on Sankt Hans Gade and a number of smaller stable and storage buildings were added in 1971. In 1895 the complex was taken over by the metal goods factory which remained on the site until the 1940s. The building is now owned by C. W.

The town,  including [[Hindsford]], [[Howe Bridge]] and [[Hag Fold railway station|Hag Fold]], is {{convert|5|mi|km|1}} east of [[Wigan]], {{convert|2|mi|km|1}} north of [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], and {{convert|10.7|mi|km|1}} northwest of [[Manchester]]. From the 17th century, for about 300 years, Atherton was known as Chowbent, which was frequently shortened to Bent, the town's old nickname.\n\nAtherton was associated with coal mining and nail manufacture from the 14th century, encouraged by outcropping coal seams. At the beginning of the 20th century the town was described as \"the centre of a district of collieries, cotton mills and iron-works, which cover the surface of the country with their inartistic buildings and surroundings, and are linked together by the equally unlovely dwellings of the people\".<ref name=vch/> Atherton's last deep coal mine closed in 1966, and the last working cotton mills closed in 1999. Today the town is the third largest retail centre in the Borough of Wigan; almost 20% of those employed in the area work in the wholesale and retail trades, although there is still some significant manufacturing industry in the town.\n\nEvidence has been discovered of a [[Roman Britain|Roman]] road passing through the area, on the ancient route between Coccium (Wigan) and [[Mamucium]] (Manchester). Following the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon]] invasion of England, Atherton, which is built on and around seven brooks, became part of the manor of [[Warrington]] until the [[Norman conquest]], when it became a township or [[vill]] in the ancient parish of Leigh.<ref name=\"GENUKI Parish map\">{{citation |title=Atherton map|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Atherton/ParishMap.shtml |publisher=genuki.org.uk |accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref> Since 1974 the town has been part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, a local government district of the [[metropolitan county|Metropolitan County]] of [[Greater Manchester]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Toponymy===\nAtherton was recorded as Aderton in 1212 and 1242, and Atherton in 1259.<ref name=vch>{{citation |last1= Farrer |first1=William |last2=Brownbill |first2= J.

In 1642, men of Chowbent were on their way to Leigh Church when word came that [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby]]'s [[Cavalier|Royalist]] troops were marching through Leigh, probably en route for Manchester.

Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600&nbsp;years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. Several types of nails were made, including [[lath]] nails, [[slate]] nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills.

The town,  including [[Hindsford]], [[Howe Bridge]] and [[Hag Fold railway station|Hag Fold]], is {{convert|5|mi|km|1}} east of [[Wigan]], {{convert|2|mi|km|1}} north of [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], and {{convert|10.7|mi|km|1}} northwest of [[Manchester]]. From the 17th century, for about 300 years, Atherton was known as Chowbent, which was frequently shortened to Bent, the town's old nickname.\n\nAtherton was associated with coal mining and nail manufacture from the 14th century, encouraged by outcropping coal seams. At the beginning of the 20th century the town was described as \"the centre of a district of collieries, cotton mills and iron-works, which cover the surface of the country with their inartistic buildings and surroundings, and are linked together by the equally unlovely dwellings of the people\".<ref name=vch/> Atherton's last deep coal mine closed in 1966, and the last working cotton mills closed in 1999. Today the town is the third largest retail centre in the Borough of Wigan; almost 20% of those employed in the area work in the wholesale and retail trades, although there is still some significant manufacturing industry in the town.\n\nEvidence has been discovered of a [[Roman Britain|Roman]] road passing through the area, on the ancient route between Coccium (Wigan) and [[Mamucium]] (Manchester). Following the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon]] invasion of England, Atherton, which is built on and around seven brooks, became part of the manor of [[Warrington]] until the [[Norman conquest]], when it became a township or [[vill]] in the ancient parish of Leigh.<ref name=\"GENUKI Parish map\">{{citation |title=Atherton map|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Atherton/ParishMap.shtml |publisher=genuki.org.uk |accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref> Since 1974 the town has been part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, a local government district of the [[metropolitan county|Metropolitan County]] of [[Greater Manchester]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Toponymy===\nAtherton was recorded as Aderton in 1212 and 1242, and Atherton in 1259.<ref name=vch>{{citation |last1= Farrer |first1=William |last2=Brownbill |first2= J.

In 1642, men of Chowbent were on their way to Leigh Church when word came that [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby]]'s [[Cavalier|Royalist]] troops were marching through Leigh, probably en route for Manchester.

Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600&nbsp;years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. Several types of nails were made, including [[lath]] nails, [[slate]] nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills. The nail smithies manufactured [[plough]]s and [[scythe]]s; their products were taken by [[pack horse]] to be sold in Manchester, [[Denbigh]], [[Clitheroe]] and [[Kendal]].{{sfn|Lunn|1971|p=19|ps=none}} The nail industry developed into the manufacture of nuts and bolts. Thomas Blakemore was the first in 1843 and by 1853 there were eight manufacturers of nuts and bolts including James Prestwich and Robert Parker.{{sfn|Lunn|1971|p=171|ps=none}} Some nut and bolt manufacturers also made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery.<ref name=vch/> Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1068454 |desc=Collier Brook Bolt House|access-date= 14 December 2012 |mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\nCoal had been mined for several hundred years in numerous shallow shafts and [[adit]]s, but took on greater importance when in 1776 Robert Vernon Atherton leased the coal rights to Thomas Guest from Leigh and John Fletcher from [[Bolton]].{{sfn|Lunn|1971|p=117|ps=none}} In 1845 the era of deep mining commenced with the sinking of Fletcher's Lover's Lane pit at [[Howe Bridge]].
