{"title_page": "Papal States under Pope Pius IX", "text_new": "{{Merge from|1859 Perugia uprising|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.\n\nA view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th \ncentury is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book \n|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About\n|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,\nwritten by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at \nthe time.  It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's \nsubjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>\n\n==Pius' internal administration==\nPius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\n[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]\nA unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>\n\n=== Education ===\nLiberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities.

In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.\n\n===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===\nIn the years that followed, Italian nationalists \u2014 both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution \u2014 saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity.

Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870.

[[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Merge from|1859 Perugia uprising|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.\n\nA view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th \ncentury is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book \n|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About\n|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,\nwritten by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at \nthe time.

The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>\n\n==Pius' internal administration==\nPius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\n[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]\nA unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>\n\n=== Education ===\nLiberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training.

King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProtestants and Jews:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States_under_Pope_Pius_IX"}

The station is owned by [[Tegna Inc.]] WLTX's studios are located on Garners Ferry Road ([[U.S. Route 76 in South Carolina|US 76]]\u2013[[U.S. Route 378|378]]) in southeastern Columbia, and its transmitter is located on Screaming Eagle Road (southeast of [[Interstate 20 in South Carolina|I-20]]) in rural northeast [[Richland County, South Carolina|Richland County]]. On [[cable television|cable]], the station is available on [[Spectrum (cable service)|Charter Spectrum]] channel 9 in both [[standard-definition television|standard]] and [[high-definition television|high definition]].\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on the air on September 1, 1953 as '''WNOK-TV''', originally broadcasting on UHF channel 67. It is the second oldest continuously operating television station in South Carolina, having signed on two months before [[WIS (TV)|WIS-TV]] (channel 10). The station has always been a CBS affiliate, but carried a secondary affiliation with the [[DuMont Television Network]] until 1955, one year before that network ceased operations. The station originally maintained studio facilities located in the Jefferson Hotel in downtown Columbia, where it was based alongside sister radio property WNOK (1230 AM, now [[WPCO]], and [[WNOK|104.7 FM]]). On June 30, 1961, the station switched channel positions, moving to UHF channel 19. In June 1967, WNOK-AM-FM-TV moved to a new studio facility on Garners Ferry Road, located {{convert|5|mi|km}} east of downtown Columbia and {{convert|1|mi|km}} from [[Interstate 77|I-77]] and the campus of the [[University of South Carolina]] School of Medicine. In 1977, the station was sold to Lewis Broadcasting and changed its call letters to '''WLTX'''.\n\nHistorically, channel 19 was well behind long-dominant WIS in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], especially in news programming. This was partly because the station was hampered by a weak signal. Although channel 19 decently covered Columbia itself as well as [[Lexington County|Lexington]] and [[Sumter County, South Carolina|Sumter]] counties, it was practically unviewable in the outlying areas of the market. Until cable television arrived in the Columbia market in the 1970s, viewers in the outlying portions of the market had to rely on [[broadcast range|grade B]] signals from [[WRDW-TV]] in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] or [[WBTV]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. However, in 1985, WLTX activated a new tall transmission tower in Lugoff that nearly doubled the station's signal and expanded its over-the-air coverage to 24 counties.\n\n[[Image:Logo WLTX .png|145px|thumb|left|WLTX's logo before 1999.]]\nIn January 1995, WLTX became a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]); it carried the network's programming on a secondary basis during weekend afternoon timeslots when CBS had only limited sports programming (namely [[PGA Tour on CBS|PGA Tour]] golf, tennis, [[NASCAR on CBS|NASCAR]] [[auto racing]], and an expanded [[College Basketball on CBS|college basketball]] schedule). The station dropped UPN programming after [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]]-licensed WQHB (channel 63, now a primary [[The CW|CW]] and secondary [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate) signed on in September 1997.\n\nIn 1998, Lewis Broadcasting sold WLTX to the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]]. Gannett invested heavily in WLTX, doubling the size of the station in 2001 and providing the staff with all new news gathering equipment. Soon after taking control, Gannett hired longtime WIS meteorologist Jim Gandy to serve as the station's chief meteorologist; however since Gandy was initially prohibited from appearing on the station's newscasts until a one-year [[non-compete clause]] in his WIS contract expired, Gannett used him as a consultant at WLTX and to serve as a substitute meteorologist at the company's other stations, including [[WXIA-TV]] in [[Atlanta]] and [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 2002, WLTX became the flagship broadcaster of the [[South Carolina Education Lottery]].\n\nIn May 2002, the station was the first commercial station in Columbia to broadcast in digital. WLTX's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.<ref name=\"Analog to Digital\">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, Gannett entered a [[Carriage dispute|dispute]] against [[Dish Network]] regarding [[Retransmission consent|compensation]] fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper [[digital video recorder]]s. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WLTX. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations (such as WLTX) should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Loose|first=Ashley|title=DISH customers may lose Gannett programming, including 12 News KPNX, over AutoHop feature|url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|accessdate=October 6, 2012|publisher=[[KNXV-TV]]|date=October 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011013154/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|archive-date=October 11, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Vuong|first=Andy|title=Gannett threatening to black out stations in its dispute with Dish|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_21710959/gannett-threatening-black-out-stations-its-dispute-dish|accessdate=October 6, 2012|newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=October 6, 2012}}</ref> The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.<ref>{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Melodie|title=Dish, Gannett Reach New Deal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444897304578044401930225948|accessdate=October 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media.

In fact, WLTX was one of the few stations in the United States to use digital technology to broadcast all games of March Madness using all digital channels.\n\n==Programming==\nWLTX carries the entire CBS network schedule. It airs the ''[[CBS Dream Team]]'' block two hours earlier (although the third hour of the block is aired by the station on Sunday mornings) and ''[[CBS This Morning#Saturday edition|CBS This Morning Saturday]]'' two hours later on Saturday mornings than most CBS stations in the time zone. [[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programs broadcast by WLTX include ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[The Doctors (talk show)|The Doctors]]'', and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''.\n\n==News operation==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WLTX News 19 News Title Card Oct 2015.png|225px|right|thumb|''News 19 at 4:30 a.m.'' Title Card as of Oct 2015.{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 27 June 2016}}]] -->\nWLTX presently broadcasts 30\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5\u00bd hours on weekdays, two hours on Saturdays and one hour on Sundays).\n\nFor most of its history, WLTX has been a solid, if usually distant, runner-up to WIS. Indeed, for a time in the 1980s, WLTX didn't air a newscast at 11 p.m., even after activating its new tower. However, in recent years, WLTX has taken the lead at noon due to having [[CBS Daytime]] as a lead-in, and has frequently traded the lead in the early morning timeslot with WIS.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, WLTX launched a weekly news segment titled \"News 19: Player of the Week,\" which recognized the accomplishments of high school student athletes in the classroom and in their sport. Future NBA star [[Ray Allen]] won the award several times while playing at Hillcrest High School (now Hillcrest Middle School) in [[Dalzell, South Carolina|Dalzell]]. After being acquired by Gannett, the station also debuted feature segments for its newscast such as \"On Your Side\", \"Restaurant Report Card\" and \"Big Money Monday.\"\n\nIn 2001, WLTX premiered a half-hour 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. WLTX's popular morning anchor team of J.R. Berry and Darci Strickland were promoted to anchoring the evening newscasts that year. During the May 2007 ratings period, WLTX's midday newscast continued to place at #1 in the noon timeslot (traditionally having [[The Price Is Right (American game show)|the same lead-in]] since 1979), while it also won first on weekday mornings during the 5:00&nbsp;a.m. half-hour. On August 20, 2007, WLTX debuted an hour-long 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast titled ''News 19: Friends @ Five''; the program won a Southeast Regional [[Emmy Award]] on June 23, 2008, for its innovative approach to connecting with viewers. The station's 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast also won an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast\" for the second year in a row. On June 26, 2010, the station's 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast took home an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast.\"\n\nOn January 24, 2011, WLTX became the third television station in the Columbia market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. In July 2013, WLTX became the second station in Columbia to expand its weekday morning newscast into the 4:30&nbsp;a.m. timeslot; later on October 5, 2013, WLTX premiered an hour-long Saturday morning newscast at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., becoming the second station in Columbia to air a morning news program on weekends (after WIS).\n\nOn January 20, 2015, WLTX was awarded the prestigious [[Alfred I. duPont\u2013Columbia University Award|Alfred I. duPont Award]] for its series of over 40 reports on the dysfunction of South Carolina's Department of Social Services.\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Joel Connable]] (deceased)\n* [[Ainsley Earhardt]] (now at [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]])\n* [[Natasha Curry]] (now at [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]])\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.wltx.com/}}\n*{{TVQ|WLTX}}\n*{{BIA|WLTX|TV|TV}}\n*[https://www.shoppersvila.com/wltx-tv-schedule/ WLTX Tv Schedule & Tv Listings Guide]\n\n{{Columbia TV}}\n{{CBS South Carolina}}\n{{Tegna}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wltx}}\n[[Category:Tegna Inc.]]\n[[Category:CBS network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Justice Network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Antenna TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Quest (American TV network) affiliates]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1953]]\n[[Category:1953 establishments in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Columbia, South Carolina|LTX]]\n[[Category:Former Gannett subsidiaries]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|CBS affiliate in Columbia, South Carolina}}\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = WLTX\n| city                     = \n| station_logo             = WLTX hdtv.png\n| logo_size                = 250px\n| station_branding         = ''WLTX News 19''\n| station_slogan           = ''On Your Side''\n| digital                  = 15 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n| virtual                  = 19 ([[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]])\n| subchannels              = \n| other_chs                = \n| affiliations             = '''19.1:''' [[CBS]]<br>'''19.2:''' [[Justice Network]] ('''[[owned-and-operated station|O&O]]''')<br>'''19.3:''' [[Antenna TV]]<br>'''19.4:''' [[Quest (American TV network)|Quest]] ('''O&O''')\n| owner                    = [[Tegna Inc.]]\n| licensee                 = Pacific and Southern, [[Limited liability company|LLC]]\n| location                 = [[Columbia, South Carolina]]\n| country                  = United States\n| airdate                  = {{start date and age|1953|9|1|p=y}}\n| enddate                  = \n| callsign_meaning         = '''L'''ewis '''T'''elevision<br/>(former owner, used same callsign format for other stations, such as [[WLTZ]])\n| sister_stations          = \n| former_callsigns         = WNOK-TV (1953\u20131977)\n| former_channel_numbers   = '''Analog:'''<br>67 (UHF, 1953\u20131961)<br/>19 (UHF, 1961\u20132009)<br>'''Digital:'''<br>17 (UHF, 2000\u20132019)\n| former_affiliations      = {{ubl|''All secondary''|[[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] (1953\u20131955)|[[UPN]] (1995\u20131997)}}\n| effective_radiated_power = 700 [[kilowatt|kW]]\n| HAAT                     = {{convert|531.7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}\n| facility_id              = 37176\n| coordinates              = {{nowrap|{{coord|34|5|50|N|80|45|50|W|type:landmark_scale:2000}}}}\n| licensing_authority      = [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]\n| homepage                 = {{url|https://www.wltx.com/}}\n}}\n\n'''WLTX''', [[virtual channel]] 19 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 15), is a [[CBS]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Columbia, South Carolina]], United States.

Soon after taking control, Gannett hired longtime WIS meteorologist Jim Gandy to serve as the station's chief meteorologist; however since Gandy was initially prohibited from appearing on the station's newscasts until a one-year [[non-compete clause]] in his WIS contract expired, Gannett used him as a consultant at WLTX and to serve as a substitute meteorologist at the company's other stations, including [[WXIA-TV]] in [[Atlanta]] and [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 2002, WLTX became the flagship broadcaster of the [[South Carolina Education Lottery]].\n\nIn May 2002, the station was the first commercial station in Columbia to broadcast in digital. WLTX's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.<ref name=\"Analog to Digital\">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, Gannett entered a [[Carriage dispute|dispute]] against [[Dish Network]] regarding [[Retransmission consent|compensation]] fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper [[digital video recorder]]s. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WLTX. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations (such as WLTX) should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Loose|first=Ashley|title=DISH customers may lose Gannett programming, including 12 News KPNX, over AutoHop feature|url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|accessdate=October 6, 2012|publisher=[[KNXV-TV]]|date=October 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011013154/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|archive-date=October 11, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Vuong|first=Andy|title=Gannett threatening to black out stations in its dispute with Dish|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_21710959/gannett-threatening-black-out-stations-its-dispute-dish|accessdate=October 6, 2012|newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=October 6, 2012}}</ref> The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.<ref>{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Melodie|title=Dish, Gannett Reach New Deal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444897304578044401930225948|accessdate=October 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WLTX was retained by the latter company, named [[Tegna Inc.|Tegna]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Separation of Gannett into two public companies completed {{!}} TEGNA|url = http://www.tegna.com/separation-of-gannett-into-two-public-companies-completed/|publisher=Tegna|accessdate = 2015-06-29}}</ref>\n\n==Digital channels==\nThe station's digital signal is [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In fact, WLTX was one of the few stations in the United States to use digital technology to broadcast all games of March Madness using all digital channels.\n\n==Programming==\nWLTX carries the entire CBS network schedule. It airs the ''[[CBS Dream Team]]'' block two hours earlier (although the third hour of the block is aired by the station on Sunday mornings) and ''[[CBS This Morning#Saturday edition|CBS This Morning Saturday]]'' two hours later on Saturday mornings than most CBS stations in the time zone. [[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programs broadcast by WLTX include ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[The Doctors (talk show)|The Doctors]]'', and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''.\n\n==News operation==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WLTX News 19 News Title Card Oct 2015.png|225px|right|thumb|''News 19 at 4:30 a.m.'' Title Card as of Oct 2015.{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 27 June 2016}}]] -->\nWLTX presently broadcasts 30\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5\u00bd hours on weekdays, two hours on Saturdays and one hour on Sundays).\n\nFor most of its history, WLTX has been a solid, if usually distant, runner-up to WIS. Indeed, for a time in the 1980s, WLTX didn't air a newscast at 11 p.m., even after activating its new tower. However, in recent years, WLTX has taken the lead at noon due to having [[CBS Daytime]] as a lead-in, and has frequently traded the lead in the early morning timeslot with WIS.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, WLTX launched a weekly news segment titled \"News 19: Player of the Week,\" which recognized the accomplishments of high school student athletes in the classroom and in their sport. Future NBA star [[Ray Allen]] won the award several times while playing at Hillcrest High School (now Hillcrest Middle School) in [[Dalzell, South Carolina|Dalzell]]. After being acquired by Gannett, the station also debuted feature segments for its newscast such as \"On Your Side\", \"Restaurant Report Card\" and \"Big Money Monday.\"\n\nIn 2001, WLTX premiered a half-hour 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. WLTX's popular morning anchor team of J.R. Berry and Darci Strickland were promoted to anchoring the evening newscasts that year. During the May 2007 ratings period, WLTX's midday newscast continued to place at #1 in the noon timeslot (traditionally having [[The Price Is Right (American game show)|the same lead-in]] since 1979), while it also won first on weekday mornings during the 5:00&nbsp;a.m. half-hour. On August 20, 2007, WLTX debuted an hour-long 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast titled ''News 19: Friends @ Five''; the program won a Southeast Regional [[Emmy Award]] on June 23, 2008, for its innovative approach to connecting with viewers. The station's 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast also won an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast\" for the second year in a row. On June 26, 2010, the station's 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast took home an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast.\"\n\nOn January 24, 2011, WLTX became the third television station in the Columbia market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. In July 2013, WLTX became the second station in Columbia to expand its weekday morning newscast into the 4:30&nbsp;a.m. timeslot; later on October 5, 2013, WLTX premiered an hour-long Saturday morning newscast at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., becoming the second station in Columbia to air a morning news program on weekends (after WIS).\n\nOn January 20, 2015, WLTX was awarded the prestigious [[Alfred I. duPont\u2013Columbia University Award|Alfred I. duPont Award]] for its series of over 40 reports on the dysfunction of South Carolina's Department of Social Services.\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Joel Connable]] (deceased)\n* [[Ainsley Earhardt]] (now at [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]])\n* [[Natasha Curry]] (now at [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]])\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.wltx.com/}}\n*{{TVQ|WLTX}}\n*{{BIA|WLTX|TV|TV}}\n\n{{Columbia TV}}\n{{CBS South Carolina}}\n{{Tegna}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wltx}}\n[[Category:Tegna Inc.]]\n[[Category:CBS network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Justice Network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Antenna TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Quest (American TV network) affiliates]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1953]]\n[[Category:1953 establishments in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Columbia, South Carolina|LTX]]\n[[Category:Former Gannett subsidiaries]]\n", "name_user": "Suraj Roy2", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WLTX"}
