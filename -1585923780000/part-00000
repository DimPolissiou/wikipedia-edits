A Limited Edition 7-disc Collector's Edition CD and DVD box set, which included remixes, outtakes, and documentary, was issued in 2005.\n\nWayne announced a new ''Musical Version of The War of the Worlds'' album to be released in June 2012 entitled ''[[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds \u2013 The New Generation]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thewaroftheworlds.com/news/newsstory.aspx?id=161 |title=The War of the Worlds...The New Generation|publisher=Official Website|date=18 November 2011}}</ref> The album was released in November 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jeff-waynes-musical-version-of-the-war-of-the-worldsthe-new-generation-134105953.html |title=Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds...The New Generation!|publisher=PR Newswire United Business Media|date=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Later work===\nAfter ''The War of the Worlds'', Wayne continued to compose and produce music, such as the music for the 1979 television film ''[[The Knowledge (film)|The Knowledge]]'' and The Who's movie ''[[McVicar (film)|McVicar]]'' released in 1980. Wayne composed music for the [[Fry's Turkish Delight]] advertisement in 1981, the theme for ''[[Good Morning Britain (1983)|Good Morning Britain]]'' in 1982 on [[TV-am]], and music for the 1984 album ''Beyond the Planets'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Kevin Peek and [[Rick Wakeman]]'s [[progressive rock]] recording of [[Planet Suite|Holst's orchestral suite]].\n\nIn 1992 Wayne released ''[[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of Spartacus]]'', his first major release since ''The War of the Worlds''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Its cast included [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], and [[Marillion]]'s [[Fish (singer)|Fish]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It featured a [[libretto]] by [[Gary Osborne]] and a story combining powerful themes of oppression, desperation, love and death\n\nWayne was involved in producing ''[[Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds (1998 video game)|Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1998, a computer game that included 45 minutes of music from his ''Musical Version of The War of the Worlds'', re-scored and [[remix]]ed in an [[electronica]] style with [[techno]] beats. The game also featured computer-generated visualisations of numerous scenes from the album \u2013 an idea Wayne would later revisit. In 1999, a related game, also titled ''[[Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds (1999 video game)|Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds]]'', was released for the [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]].\n\nWayne and Ollie Record Productions began work on a feature-length animated [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film based on his ''War of the Worlds'' album in 2004, with a $48 million budget and a planned release date in 2007; however, the project was shelved and has yet to enter production.\n\n''The War of the Worlds'' was re-released in the summer of 2005. It spent ten consecutive weeks in the Top 10 of the UK Album charts. Including this re-release, the album achieved sales to 3 million in the UK, and approximately 14 million worldwide. Also in 2005, it was announced that the musical would be going on a UK tour in April 2006. The live show was taken to Australia and New Zealand and returned the UK during December 2007. The show, produced by [[Damian Collier]], used a ten-piece band and a 48-piece string orchestra, voice actors, screen-projected images and [[animatronics]]. [[Universal Pictures]] released a DVD of the show, filmed at [[Wembley Arena]] using 23 [[high-definition video|high definition]] cameras and directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]].\n\nWayne's first television series, ''The Book of Tennis Chronicles'', was broadcast worldwide in 2005 and distributed by Fox Sports. It features well-known tennis players and events, set against events in world history from 1877 to 2005. Wayne created and produced eight half-hour episodes and scored its music. The series' executive producer was Damian Collier.\n\nWayne said in 2009 that he was working on a musical adaptation of [[Jack London]]'s novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', but was not expecting to complete it during the live stage production of ''The War of the Worlds''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VC6UxosiDs|title=War of the Worlds composer talks to the Mail Pt3|author=Wayne, Jeff|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=5 June 2009|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Tennis==\nWayne has remained involved with tennis; he has won the British National Indoor Veterans singles and doubles titles, and the National Clay Court doubles.

He appears as a tall, thin man with dark, curly hair. Like the original character, Sherlock is highly intelligent and able to [[Deductive reasoning|deduce]] or [[Abductive reasoning|abduce]] information from the small details. According to [[Molly Hooper]] in the episode ''[[The Sign of Three]]'', he is a graduate [[Chemistry|chemist]].\n\nSherlock has a very unusual personality, and describes himself in the first episode \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", as a \"high-functioning [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]\", a term he insists on in subsequent episodes. Others call him a \"[[psychopathy|psychopath]]\", and in \"[[The Hounds of Baskerville]]\" John Watson tells Lestrade that he believes Sherlock has [[Asperger syndrome]]. This manifests itself in very poor people skills and the extremely rude manners Sherlock shows toward everyone he deals with. At times, he also seems to exhibit [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory sensitivities]], associated with [[autism spectrum disorders]], and occasionally exhibits \"[[stimming]]\" behaviors (pacing, hopping, spinning, rocking, making origami from serviettes, flapping a hand) when excited, upset, stressed, concentrating deeply, or overwhelmed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Sherlock is an Aspie|url = http://sherlockisanaspie.tumblr.com/tagged/stimming|website = sherlockisanaspie.tumblr.com (warning: profanity present in source)|accessdate = 26 November 2015}}</ref> On two occasions in the episode [[The Hounds of Baskerville]], he also appears to suffer from episodes of [[sensory overload]] and has minor meltdowns, and fidgeting with his hand after such an episode appears to soothe him. Also a characteristic of autism, Sherlock can be shown to have a very literal understanding of what is said to him \u2013 once, when after Sherlock tells John that he wants to go out that evening, John tells him that can't because he is going on a date, describing it as \"two people who like each other [going] out and [having] fun\", Sherlock replies that \"That's what [he] was suggesting.\"  [[Nonverbal communication]] also does not seem to come naturally to him, and he appears sometimes not to understand [[sarcasm]], though he uses it often. During the episode ''[[The Six Thatchers]]'', John and Lestrade have a sarcastic conversation during which they compare Sherlock's neediness and selfishness to that of John's infant daughter, and although Sherlock is able to tell that they are making a joke about him, he does not fully comprehend. After asking them if they are making a joke, he admits that he \"doesn't get it.\" He is also disdainful of the \"typical\" affectionate relationships he sees other people sharing, referring to them as \"sentiment ... a chemical defect found on the losing side.\" He seems to admit that he [[Theory of mind|does not understand]] sentiment and does not wish to, but, as seen below, he is shown to care deeply about his closest friends. Sherlock is, however, skilled at [[Crocodile tears|feigning emotion]] and is shown successfully [[Social engineering (security)|manipulating strangers]] \u2013 mostly by playing on their weaknesses \u2013 into helping him or providing information useful for a case.  His brother Mycroft, in the first episode, says Sherlock has the mind of a [[Scholarly method|scholar]] or [[philosopher]].\n\nFurthermore, Sherlock does not seem to understand the deep emotional impact his actions have on those who care deeply about him. Though Sherlock's fake [[suicide]] at the end of \"[[The Reichenbach Fall]]\" was conducted in order to protect Sherlock's friends, including John; when, two years later, Sherlock is ready to return to [[London]] and reunite with John, he seems to [[Mind-blindness|have no idea]] of the [[Psychological pain|pain]] and [[grief]] John has suffered as the result of his \"death\". When Sherlock reveals himself to John, having disguised himself as a waiter, he is unhappily shocked at Watson's intense emotional reaction and the fact that John does not immediately accept him back into his life. After he and John have become close again, Sherlock is completely shocked when John asks him to be the best man at his and Mary's wedding, and is unable to mentally finish John's statement about wanting to be \"with the two people that [he] love[s] and care[s] about most in the world\" with his own name. Again, understanding John's words literally, when John first uses the phrase \"the best man\", Sherlock goes off on a tangent describing the \"best man\" he ever knew until John pauses him and explains that he is referring to the \"best man\" for his and Mary's upcoming wedding. During his best man speech later on in the episode, Sherlock moves everyone deeply by telling John that he is sitting \"between the woman [he has] made [his] wife and the man [he] has saved; in short, the two people who love (him) most in all this world,\" and that he was shocked because he \"never expected to be anybody's best friend. And certainly not the best friend of the bravest, and kindest and the wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing.\"\n\nSherlock seems to care more about the crimes than about the victims involved. He is rude and appears to be inconsiderate towards others, including John (often leaving him behind and asking him to do menial, domestic tasks such as shopping). However, Sherlock is shown to care deeply for John as the series goes on, showing uncharacteristic emotion when his friend's life is in jeopardy or when John comes to his aid. Sherlock states the highest compliment he can give is saying that Mary deserves John as a husband. He considers only four people as his friends: John Watson, Mrs Hudson, Molly Hooper and DI Greg Lestrade, whose first name he never remembers. He also has an extremely complex relationship with his brother Mycroft, his only admitted intellectual superior. Mycroft, from the outset, is shown to care and worry deeply for him whilst at the same time sharing a mix of mutual contempt and respect. Sherlock seems to have grown more fond of his brother as the stories progress, even pleading with Mycroft to attend John and Mary's wedding; though he was also scornful upon hearing his brother admit he'd be saddened by his death.\n\nSherlock appears largely [[Asexuality|asexual]] and describes himself as \"married to his work\". He seems oblivious to the romantic attraction that Molly has toward him in the first two series. After the introduction of Irene Adler, Sherlock seems to have some interest in Irene, though her attempts to throw him off by shocking him seem to have no effect on him; and comes to her rescue when she is about to be executed in [[Karachi]]. She frequently flirts with and texts Sherlock in \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\", but he seldom responds. In the following series, Sherlock briefly has a mental image of her in his Mind Palace when thinking of who would know John's middle name, but quickly retorts \"Out of my head, I'm busy.\" In Series 3 he is briefly in a relationship with Janine; however, this is later revealed to be a ruse to gain information on her boss, and he carefully avoids allowing the relationship to become too intense.\n\nSherlock has considerable fighting ability, fighting off a man armed with a sword using his bare hands in [[The Blind Banker]]. In [[A Scandal in Belgravia]], he disarms and incapacitates a CIA agent on two separate occasions. At the end of Series Three, seeing no other choice, he shoots and kills Charles Augustus Magnussen, a corrupt and unethical newspaper owner who is threatening to release incriminating material he has on Mary Watson. Instead of going to prison, Sherlock is sent to do dangerous undercover work in Central Europe; this is interrupted by the shocking revelation at the end of Series Three of [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]]'s survival. Sherlock also enjoys dancing; proudly demonstrating a perfect pirouette to Janine in [[The Sign of Three]] during the reception of John and Mary's wedding and lamenting the fact that dancing \"never really comes up in crime work\". In the same episode, shortly after he deduces Mary's [[pregnancy]], Sherlock explains that he is the one who taught John to dance.\n\nHe knows the streets and alleys of London extremely well; in [[A Study in Pink]], he quickly figures out what route a cab would take and plans a route to beat it to its destination. In [[The Empty Hearse]], Sherlock works out which paths to take to shave time off the countdown to save John. He has strange connections, including a [[graffiti artist]], as well as the entire network of the homeless (similar to the [[Baker Street Irregulars]]' street urchins in the original stories). In solving cases, Sherlock uses a technique known as the [[Method of Loci]], which he calls his \"mind palace\", which enables him to efficiently store and retrieve information for deductions. Initially the mind palace appears as a series of assorted facts that appear on the screen when a scene is shown from Sherlock's point of view. In series 3, the mind palace became a very elaborate construction where other characters from the series discuss Sherlock's cases with him.\n\nSherlock has violent mood swings when there are no cases that interest him. He is once seen stretched out on his chair and firing a gun at a smiley face spray-painted on the wall in his flat. He finds smoking impractical in present-day urban London and, therefore, mostly makes do with [[nicotine patch]]es. He may apply three patches at the same time when it is a \"three patch problem\", implying the nicotine helps him to think. For the same reason, he plays the [[violin]] and even composes music from time to time. Sherlock also has a history of [[recreational drug use]]; solving dangerous cases, as he puts it, \"as an alternative to getting high.\" Seen in [[His Last Vow]], Sherlock has a short fuse when high or recovering, shoving Mycroft against the wall of the flat and painfully twisting one arm behind him; John was concerned in this scene that Sherlock would seriously injure his brother.\n\nDespite the challenges Sherlock presents toward potential friends, John is extremely loyal to his flatmate. In Series Three, after Sherlock returns from his two-year absence, John selects Sherlock to be the [[Groomsman|best man]] at his and Mary's wedding. The speech Sherlock gives is somewhat awkward, with his demeanor showing how uncomfortable he is with making a speech in front of strangers,<ref name=\":0\" /> and his apparent lack of understanding when a number of deeply moved guests begin to sniffle and was extremely touched John abruptly hugs him. Although Sherlock is not generally a \"hugger,\" in the episode [[The Lying Detective]], when John, who is still mourning for Mary, begins to cry, Sherlock, without being asked, takes John in his arms and holds him as he cries.\n\nTrying to prevent anyone, specifically the press, from getting a photograph of his face, Sherlock disguises it with a modern cap styled after a classic [[deerstalker]]. This becomes his trademark\u2014much to his annoyance as he greatly dislikes the hat, describing it in [[The Reichenbach Fall]] as a \"death [[Flying disc|Frisbee]]\" and expressing confusion about the advantage this hat, according to its name, would provide to a person hunting deer. He concludes that as this hat has ear flaps, it is an \"ear hat.\" However, he seems to have accepted the fact that the hat is now his trademark since he puts one on before greeting the press about his miraculous return in [[The Empty Hearse]]. Sherlock is also shown not to enjoy eating; in \"[[The Blind Banker]]\", he explains to Molly Hooper that he doesn't eat while he's working, as digesting slows him down. In the pilot episode of the show, he tells John that he does not eat every day, and later in the episode, John uses the fact that Sherlock has not eaten in several days to convince Lestrade to allow Sherlock to leave the scene of the [[Taxicab|cabbie]] Jeff Hope's death \u2013 in order to go and eat dinner \u2013 instead of staying to share his deductions with the police force.\n\n===Dr. John Watson {{anchor|Dr. Watson}} ===\n[[File:Martin Freeman during filming of Sherlock cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Freeman]] as [[Dr. Watson|John Watson]]]]\n'''[[Dr. Watson|John Hamish Watson]]''' ([[Martin Freeman]]) is Sherlock's best friend. He is often a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to Sherlock in both appearance and personality. Unlike Sherlock, John is short with [[blond]] hair. He is friendly, compassionate, and patient, compared to Sherlock's aloof, cold-hearted tendencies. He gets on better with the police and takes care of practical matters at their flat, apparently doing most of the shopping. Sherlock has called him \"the wisest, warmest human being [he] knows\", and has stated that \"the warmth and constancy of [John's] friendship\" can redeem even a \"rude, ignorant, all-around obnoxious arsehole like [Sherlock].\"\n\nJohn seems to behave as Sherlock's advocate, helping strangers to understand what they should expect from Sherlock as he helps Sherlock to behave in socially acceptable ways. He calmly but sternly corrects Sherlock when he is brash and tries to get him to understand \"typical\" human emotions, which Sherlock snidely refers to as \"sentiment\", to him. John is very tolerant and understanding; as Sherlock's [[Roommate|flatmate]] he has to deal with everything from coming home to find Sherlock shooting holes in the wall to opening the refrigerator and discovering a severed human head. He is shown to, in general, be very protective of Sherlock and his quirks; when, at the beginning of \"[[The Hounds of Baskerville]]\", Sherlock is angrily pacing the sitting room of their flat, desperate for a case, John encourages him and tries to help him find something to do, although, after Sherlock's deduction of Mrs. Hudson proves extremely insulting, John tells him off and insists he apologize. One thing John will not do with Sherlock, however, is play the game [[Cluedo]]; Sherlock's frustration that the inflexible rules of the game do not allow for scenarios that resemble realistic cases has apparently ruined the game for John. After he becomes engaged to [[Minor Sherlock Holmes characters|Mary Morstan]] in Series Three, John develops a [[code]] with Mary that they use when one of them realizes that they need to privately discuss an issue Sherlock is having.\n\nAt the start of the series, John is recently invalided home from [[Afghanistan]] after serving with the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] as part of [[Operation Herrick|Britain's role in the 2001\u20132014 Afghanistan war]]. He was honourably discharged as a Captain. Prior to his military period, John read [[medicine]] at [[King's College London]], as seen on his [[Curriculum vitae|CV]]. He is in possession of a [[SIG-Sauer P226|service pistol]], with which he is highly proficient, being described as a \"crack shot\" by Sherlock. He often uses his former position to help Sherlock and him get into high security places (like in The Hound of Baskerville).\n\nAt the beginning of the series, John has several medical issues: a [[psychosomatic]] limp in his right leg, a bullet wound in his left shoulder, and an \"intermittent [[tremor]]\" in his left hand. John's therapist notes he has \"trust issues\" and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]], but Sherlock's brother, Mycroft, says that he is far from being \"haunted by the war\" and that John actually misses the thrill of battle. Following a chase around London with Sherlock, in which he forgets his cane at a restaurant, John's limp disappears, and Mycroft observes that in a stressful situation John has no sign of a hand tremor. When asked by Sherlock, on their first case together, whether he wants to see more horrible deaths, John responds, \"Oh God, yes!\" In the 3rd series, it is further elaborated that John is subconsciously addicted to danger. Sherlock explains that this is why John chose to put his trust in him, a sociopath who solves dangerous cases as an alternative to getting high, and fell in love with Mary, a former [[secret agent]] and assassin.\n\nJohn is shown to be dependable and brave, with a strong sense of personal integrity. He refuses Mycroft's offer to pay him to spy on Sherlock, despite only having just met Sherlock; however, Series 3 shows John informing Mycroft of anything wrong Sherlock has done, showing he will inform others of Sherlock's actions if they are family. He is willing to use deadly force and shows impressive physical strength; in the episode [[A Scandal in Belgravia]], when a confused Sherlock, who has been rendered ill by [[Irene Adler|Irene Adler's]] poison, gets out of bed to search for her and falls, John is able to lift him from the floor to return him to bed.\n\nIn the first series John gets a [[locum]] job at a nearby general practice to supplement his [[pension]]. In the second series, John is referred to as Sherlock's [[Personal Assistant|P.A.]] and is not shown working any other job. John writes about Sherlock's cases on his [[blog]], which attracts clients to them. He also gives the cases names he deems appropriate.\n\nMuch to John's constant annoyance, he is often mistaken for a [[Homosexuality|gay man]] because of the time he spends around Sherlock. In the pilot episode, when John first meets Sherlock and begins working with him, many assume they are now a couple. When waiting in a restaurant for the cabbie to arrive, the restaurant owner, Angelo, tells Sherlock that he and \"his date\" can have anything they want on the menu for free. John insists that he's not Sherlock's date, however Sherlock remains quiet. When John meets Mycroft for the first time, Mycroft asks \"Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?\u201d in reference to the fact that John quickly moved in with Sherlock after meeting him. He is indicated to have had a number of short-lived relationships with women \u2013 one of whom is shown breaking up with him due to John's commitment to Sherlock, saying angrily \"You\u2019re a great boyfriend. Sherlock is a very lucky man.\" In Series 3, when he tells Mrs. Hudson that he is engaged, she asks \"So, what's his name?\"\n\nThe only member of John's family who has been alluded to thus far is his sister, Harriet (aka Harry), with whom he has an estranged relationship due to her being a [[Alcoholism|heavy drinker]] and the separation of her and her ex-wife, Clara. During their first case together, Sherlock deduces that John had refused to accept help from Harry after being invalided out of the army, even though the fact that she gave John her old phone is an indication that she wants to stay in touch with her brother. John was not too surprised when she didn't show up to his wedding, noting a free bar would have been a bad mix with Harry around. Sherlock also guesses that John's extended family is not very close to him.\n\nJohn' middle name is revealed to be Hamish, as originally suggested by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] to explain discrepancies in John's name between several of Conan Doyle's stories.<ref>[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], \"Dr. Watson's Christian Name\", in ''Unpopular Opinions'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1946), 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\n===D.I. Greg Lestrade {{anchor|Lestrade|DI Lestrade|Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade|Greg Lestrade}} ===\n[[File:Rupert Graves 2010 cropped.jpg|thumb|226x226px|[[Rupert Graves]] plays [[Inspector Lestrade|Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade]]]]\n'''[[Inspector Lestrade|Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade]]''' ([[Rupert Graves]]) works for Scotland Yard. He has a reluctant respect for Sherlock and often defends him from the other police officers' animosity. He is often frustrated by Sherlock's cryptic deductions and habit of withholding evidence, but believes that he is a great man (hoping that one day, he can overcome his poorer qualities, and become a \"good\" man).\n\nIn \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", he mentions that he is in an on-again-off-again relationship with his ex-wife. In \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\", Lestrade says he and his wife have settled their problems, but Sherlock flatly informs him that she is (as of Christmas that year) sleeping with a [[Physical education|P.E.]] teacher.\n\nIn \"[[The Reichenbach Fall]]\", Lestrade agrees to bring Sherlock in for questioning and it becomes apparent that Lestrade's superiors were not aware of Sherlock's involvement in cases. Unlike Donovan and Anderson, Lestrade had complete faith that Sherlock was innocent of any wrongdoing, proving just how much he trusted him. Later in the same story, Lestrade is one of three people identified by Moriarty as Sherlock's friends (the other two being John and Mrs Hudson). In \"[[The Sign of Three]]\", Lestrade's faith in Sherlock is shown to have escalated to comical levels, and he drops all pressing matters to comply with his requests (which proves to be embarrassing when Sherlock's request for help was revealed to be motivated by nothing more than a desire for assistance in writing his best man speech for John's wedding).\n\nBy the fourth season, Sherlock and Lestrade's relationship, while still strained, has become notably better, as Sherlock's interaction with John helps him be a better person. After a traumatic case involving the Holmes' psychotic sister, Eurus, which was ended when Sherlock made a genuinely emotional plea to her as he acknowledged her condition, Lestrade noted at the case's conclusion that Sherlock was \"a good man\", able to recognize the human element that he had once lacked.\n\nAlthough Lestrade is ranked as 'DI,' i.e. 'Detective Inspector,', the Lestrade in the original novels was ranked as Inspector (the rank of 'DI' not having been created at that time.) A running joke in the series is that Sherlock consistently fails to remember Lestrade's first name, with Lestrade noting that Sherlock remembering his name properly is a sign of his social improvement.\n\n===Mrs. Hudson===\n[[File:Una Stubbs, filming Sherlock (2015).jpg|thumb|[[Una Stubbs]] as [[Mrs. Hudson|Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson]] while filming for ''Sherlock''.]]\n'''[[Minor Sherlock Holmes characters#Mrs. Hudson|Martha Louise Hudson]]''', ''n\u00e9e'' '''Sissons''' ([[Una Stubbs]]) is the landlady of [[221B Baker Street]]. Sherlock won his way into her good graces after ensuring her husband, who ran a [[drug cartel]], was executed for a double murder in Florida.\n\nAlthough she repeatedly insists that she is not their [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson fusses over Sherlock as if she were, and he takes it for granted that she will provide dinner for him. She is often horrified to see Sherlock keep human body parts in his kitchen appliances (refrigerator, microwave) for experimentation. In [[A Study in Pink]], upon first meeting John, Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson thought he was Sherlock's romantic partner, and throughout the show, she is seen to still believe that they are a gay couple, despite John's repeated protests that he is not gay and that he and Sherlock are not a couple. Despite his impatience at her concern for him, Sherlock has shown to have a great deal of affection for Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson; for example while he often tells her to shut up when he considers her input an annoyance, he is quick to reprimand his brother Mycroft for attempting to do the same. In [[A Scandal in Belgravia]], Sherlock pushes a CIA agent [[Defenestration|out of a second-story window]] multiple times to punish him for torturing Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson; later in the same episode when John suggests Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson leave Baker Street for her own safety, Sherlock appears appalled at the notion and informs John 'England would fall' should such a thing happen.\n\nIt is revealed in [[His Last Vow]] (along with her full name) that she is a \"semi-reformed [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]],\" a former \"exotic dancer,\" and that her weakness is [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Sherlock later makes a jab at her past, when explaining the secrets held by the people John knew.\n\nIn the hallucinations of \"[[The Abominable Bride]]\", Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson is shown upset that she has no speaking role in Watson's stories and Sherlock suggests he \"give her some lines\" as she \"is perfectly capable of starving us\".\n\nIn \"[[The Lying Detective]]\", Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson is shown to own a very fast sports car \u2013 although she is a somewhat reckless driver \u2013 defending her possession of it by noting that she is the widow of a drug dealer who owns property in central London. Later in the episode, when Mycroft has agents turning over the flat to explain Sherlock's recent actions and finds a DVD the recently deceased Mary Watson recorded for Sherlock, Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson orders all the agents to leave her and John alone to watch the recording unless they wish to prove that they \"have no human decency\", subsequently ordering Mycroft \"Get out of my house, you reptile!\" when he remains in the room regardless. When a bomb is 'delivered' to Baker Street via drone, putting Sherlock, John, and Mycroft in a position where they will have three seconds to flee out of the room before the bomb explodes, Sherlock uses his knowledge of Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson's routine to calculate when would be the safest time to leave the room so that she will be unharmed by the blast, as she was initially hoovering directly beneath them.\n\n===Mycroft Holmes===\n[[File:Mark Gatiss at A Scandal in Belgravia screening.png|thumb|237x237px|[[Mark Gatiss]] plays [[Mycroft Holmes]]]]\n'''[[Mycroft Holmes]]''' (played by the show's executive producer, co-creator, and writer [[Mark Gatiss]]) is first introduced when he abducts John and offers to pay him to spy on Sherlock. He is Sherlock's older brother and engages in [[sibling rivalry]] with Sherlock. Mycroft is frequently mocked by Sherlock for \u201c[[weight gain|putting on weight]]\u201d. He occupies a \"minor position in the British government\"; however, as with many Holmes-based works, it is heavily hinted that he has a much bigger role than he claims \u2013 on one occasion, Sherlock sarcastically remarks that Mycroft ''is'' the British government \"when he\u2019s not too busy being the [[British secret services|British Secret Services]], or the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] on a freelance basis\". He is driven around in a private car with his [[personal assistant]] who goes by the name of \"Anthea\".\n\nJust as in the Doyle books, Mycroft is even more skilled at deduction, correcting Sherlock on occasion and beating him in deduction exercises, as well as lacking enthusiasm for \"legwork\". His intellect is borderline superhuman, allowing him to learn [[Serbian language|Serbian]] in a couple of hours (with Sherlock even noting that he once was capable of learning it much faster). As such, even Sherlock admits that Mycroft is smarter than he is; in reference to their childhood, Mycroft thought Sherlock was \"an idiot\", only changing his mind when they compared themselves with other children.\n\nDespite not paying John like he originally suggested, Mycroft is kept informed of anything his brother does that may be illegal, as seen in \u201c[[His Last Vow]]\u201d, where John informs him Sherlock had seemingly relapsed back into his old [[Substance abuse|drug habits]]. Though concerned, Mycroft jokes it would be safer for Sherlock to [[Cross-dressing|cross-dress]] like their uncle.\n\nMycroft knows his brother well, saying Sherlock considers himself a dragon-slayer; the villains Sherlock catches are the equivalent of dragons. In Mycroft's opinion, Sherlock has \"the mind of philosopher or scientist, yet he elects to be a detective\". However, he considers this an improvement, since as a child, Sherlock initially wanted to be a [[Piracy|pirate]]. Charles Augustus Magnussen in [[His Last Vow]] reveals Mycroft to be in the [[Secret Intelligence Service]].\n\nThe brothers have been seen challenging each other's wits throughout the series, and enjoy playing ''[[Operation (game)|Operation]]'' as though it were a [[chess]] game. Cigarette addiction is something Mycroft shares with Sherlock; Sherlock remarks that Mycroft can only handle low tar cigarettes and thus \"smokes like a beginner\". Sherlock also declares to John that Mycroft has [[Obsessive Compulsive Disorder|OCD]].\n\nIn \"The Abominable Bride\", in Sherlock's [[Method of loci|Mind Palace]], Mycroft is shown to be [[morbidly obese]] and engaging in a bet with Sherlock as to how long he has before dying. (Recurring series 1. Main series 2\u2013)\n\n===Molly Hooper===\n[[File:Loobrealeyheadshot.jpg|thumb|230x230px|[[Louise Brealey]] plays Molly Hooper]]\n'''Molly Hooper''' ([[Louise Brealey]]) is a 31-year-old [[specialist registrar]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-11-01/meet-the-cast-of-clique/ |title=Meet the cast of Clique |work=[[Radio Times]] |accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> working in the morgue at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] with an apparent crush on Sherlock. Due to her work position and crush on him, Sherlock frequently exploits her to let him examine or perform experiments on victims' bodies, such as in Sherlock's first scene in \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", beating them with a [[Crop (implement)|riding crop]] in order to study postmortem [[Bruise|bruising]]. In \"The Great Game\", she was in a relationship with an [[Information technology|IT]] employee named Jim, later revealed to be Moriarty, who was using her to see Sherlock up close.\n\nSherlock only finds out how deeply infatuated she is with him during \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\", when he acidly deduces that the Christmas present at the top of her bag is better wrapped than the others, and must be for someone she loves, and then discovers it's for him; she received a very uncharacteristic kiss on the cheek and apology for this. In \"[[The Reichenbach Fall]]\", Sherlock turns to her to help him fake his death. At one point, Molly points out how sad Sherlock looks when he thinks John cannot see him. He states that she can see him to which she replies that she does not count. Sherlock later tells her that she does count, that she has always counted and that he has always trusted her. When she asks what he needs, he replies with \"you\".\n\nIn \"[[The Empty Hearse]]\", while John is recovering from the hurt and shock of discovering Sherlock is still alive, she accompanies Holmes on some casework. It is revealed that she was a confidante and a key element when Sherlock faked his death. Sherlock also tells her that Moriarty made a mistake in believing that she did not matter to him, when he, in fact, admits to her that she was \"the one person who mattered the most\". During the first two episodes of the third season, she is engaged to Tom (Ed Birch) who looks and dresses quite a bit like Sherlock. In \"The Sign of Three\", Molly stabs Tom with a plastic fork when he interrupts Sherlock. By \"His Last Vow\", the engagement has been broken off\u2014Sherlock observes she is not wearing her engagement ring. During her engagement to Tom, when Molly mentions the intimacy she and Tom are sharing, Sherlock appears confused.\n\nIn \"The Abominable Bride\", Molly appears disguised as a man (also named \"Hooper\") who runs the morgue, and is extremely irritable towards Sherlock; John sees through her disguise, identifying her as a woman trying to get ahead in a \"male world\"; he remarks that the perception of such things is something that Sherlock is unusually bad at.\n\nIn \"The Six Thatchers\", John and Mary ask Molly (along with Mrs. Hudson and a reluctant Sherlock) to be a godparent for their daughter Rosie. During the episode, Molly babysits Rosie on several occasions as John and Mary assist Sherlock. When Mary is killed, Molly stays with John to look after the baby and informs Sherlock that John wants nothing to do with him.\n\nIn \"[[The Final Problem (Sherlock)|The Final Problem]]\", Sherlock's deranged sister threatens to detonate a bomb in Molly's flat unless he can phone her and get her to say the words 'I love you' without revealing that she is in danger. Sherlock is forced to say \"I love you\" to Molly. He says it twice in desperation, and afterwards, Molly finally says it too. After this scene, Sherlock proceeds to break the coffin that was supposed to be hers in a very agitated state, thus showing how much he cares for his friend. In an interview, Steven Moffat said that \"In the end of that scene, she\u2019s a bit wounded by it all\",<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/sherlock-season-4-finale-louise-brealey-steven-moffat-molly-hooper-a7532046.html%7D|title=Louise Brealey says she disagrees with Sherlock writer over Molly scene |date=17 January 2017 }}</ref> but also that \"Molly was fine\".<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/>\n\nMolly was originally intended to be a one-off character to introduce Sherlock, but Brealey impressed Moffat and Gatiss and they \"couldn\u2019t resist bringing her back\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Wells |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/may/21/sherlock-reichenbach-fall-live-chat|title=Sherlock: The Reichenbach Fall - live chat with the co-creators |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 May 2012 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> (Recurring series&nbsp;1. Main series&nbsp;2\u2013)\n\n=== Jim Moriarty {{anchor|James Moriarty|Moriarty}} ===\n[[File:Pride 04 (15269391641).jpg|thumb|243x243px|[[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] plays [[Professor Moriarty|James Jim Moriarty]]]]\n'''[[Professor Moriarty|James \"Jim\" Moriarty]]''' ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]) is a \"consulting criminal\", a counterpoint to Sherlock's similarly unrivaled \"consulting detective\". He is responsible for the criminals and crimes in all three episodes of the first series, acting as a sponsor, an informant, or a mastermind. His interest in Sherlock borders on obsession, though he does not hesitate trying to kill him when he loses interest. Like Sherlock, he possesses a genius level intellect and appears to be motivated by boredom rather than money or power.\n\nHe is an excellent actor, frequently shown to have convinced others that he is someone else \u2013 indeed his first appearance occurs as a [[gay]] man whom Molly is seeing, and Sherlock does not realise his identity at the time. In \"The Great Game\", Moriarty forces Sherlock to solve mysteries within a time limit, taking hostages to ensure that Sherlock is sufficiently motivated.\n\nIn the second series, he continues in his role as consulting criminal, giving [[Irene Adler]] advice on how to manipulate \"The Holmes Boys\", having given them both nicknames. It is mentioned that he asked for nothing in return, becoming involved just to cause trouble. He is seen briefly at the end of \"The Hounds of Baskerville\" apparently having been captured and in the process of being released by Mycroft.\n\nMoriarty features extensively in the second series finale \"The Reichenbach Fall\", where he simultaneously breaks into the [[Tower of London]], [[HMP Pentonville]] and the [[Bank of England]], using some sort of master key code. He is tried but acquitted after [[Jury intimidation|intimidating the Jury]]. He then pretends to be an actor named Richard Brook and manipulates journalist Kitty Riley as well as the general populace into thinking he has been forced by Sherlock into portraying Jim Moriarty. After revealing to Sherlock that the key was a hoax, he forces Sherlock into committing suicide in order to save his friends, but when Sherlock realises there is a way out as long as Moriarty is alive, Moriarty shoots himself in the head.\n\nMoriarty appears in the third series in either flashbacks, alternative scenarios, or Sherlock's \"mind palace\" vignettes. It is revealed that Sherlock had spent two years dismantling Moriarty's network. However, in the closing moments of the third-season finale, \"[[His Last Vow]]\", Moriarty's face appears on televisions across Britain repeating the statement \"Did you miss me?\". Sherlock, who had just been sent on an intelligence mission that was guaranteed to result in his death, was immediately recalled to face his nemesis' schemes once more.\n\nIn the special episode \"[[The Abominable Bride]]\", set in [[Victorian era]], Moriarty and Sherlock confront at [[221B Baker Street|Baker Street]] and the [[Reichenbach Falls]]. The whole conversation, however, is just a part of Sherlock's dream in his [[Method of loci|mind palace]]. During this dream, the figment of Moriarty appears to almost succeed in killing Sherlock.\n\nMoriarty appears briefly in some of the fourth series episodes. Although Sherlock confirms that Moriarty is definitely dead, his image saying \"Did you miss me?\" recurs. In \"The Final Problem\", it is revealed that Moriarty had arranged with Mycroft to meet with Eurus Holmes for five minutes unsupervised, during which he was manipulated to do Eurus's bidding.\n\n===Mary (Morstan) Watson {{anchor|Mary Watson|Mary Morstan}} ===\n[[File:Amanda Abbington at the 2015 Laurence Olivier Awards.jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[Amanda Abbington]] plays [[Mary Morstan]]]]\n'''[[Mary Morstan|Rosamund Mary Elizabeth Morstan]]''' ([[Amanda Abbington]]) is a former assassin and a part-time [[Nursing|nurse]] in John's practice whom he met following the apparent death of Sherlock. She surprises Sherlock with her knowledge and insight into his character. She marries Watson, with Sherlock as best man.\n\nIn \"The Empty Hearse\", Mary is upset with Sherlock when they meet, since John had been through a great deal of emotional pain; however, she quickly warmed up to him, and saw that Sherlock had great challenges when it came to understanding human emotions. Knowing the great friendship John shared with Sherlock, Mary then made it her job to try to get John to forgive Sherlock.\n\nIn \"The Sign of Three,\" it is revealed that Mary is an orphan. She had another boyfriend prior to John, but is now good friends with him (from her perspective); unknown to Mary, her ex retained an unhealthy attraction to her, forcing Sherlock to intimidate him before the wedding by describing himself as \"a high-functioning sociopath... with your number.\" She seems to know how to get what she wants from both John and Sherlock. She understands both of them very well and respects their close, brotherly friendship; during \"[[The Sign of Three]]\" as the three of them sit in the flat at Baker Street planning the wedding, she realizes how much Sherlock, who is averse to change, needs to know that John still cares deeply about him and will always be his friend, and how much John also needs to connect with him, and insists that the two of them go out on a case. During this scene, Mary sees that Sherlock is afraid, as evidenced by the large number of [[Sydney Opera House]]-shaped [[origami]] [[serviette]]s he is seen to have created out of nervous energy while John and Mary had had their private conversation. She is also very patient during Sherlock's long-winded and embarrassing [[Wedding|best man speech]] at the reception of her and John's wedding, appearing to be quite amused by Sherlock's rambling, awkward, but ultimately very touching soliloquy. During the show, Mary is shown to have an unusually excellent memory and the ability to understand a skip code; clues which help Sherlock realize that all is not as it seems with Mrs. Watson. It is later revealed in \"[[His Last Vow]]\" that Mary is in fact a former intelligence agent, who went [[wiktionary:rogue#Adjective|freelance]] and eventually on the run, and might not be English. An upset John even commented she should have married Sherlock since they're so alike. She stole her identity from a dead child five years before marrying John, seemingly deliberately choosing one named Mary as she \"always liked\" her middle name. Despite all the lies she told him, she genuinely loves John and says she only sought to escape her previous life; she was prepared to shoot both Sherlock and Charles Magnussen to ensure John never learnt the truth; though, as a world-class sharpshooter, she was able to shoot Sherlock in such a way that he would be hospitalized but would not die. At the end of the third series, Mary is pregnant with a daughter.\n\nIn \"The Six Thatchers\", Mary gives birth to her and John's daughter, whom they name Rosamund (which is revealed to be her real first name). More information about her past is revealed, when a former member of A.G.R.A. (a freelance special forces unit) attempts to track her down, blaming her for betraying their squad during a failed mission in Tbilisi, Georgia which resulted in his capture and torture. Sherlock works out the traitor was government official Vivian Norbury, whom he and Mary confront in the London Aquarium. As Mycroft and the police arrive, Norbury produces a gun and shoots at Sherlock, but Mary takes the bullet and dies in John's arms. Sherlock receives a posthumous DVD message from Mary, assigning him his \"most difficult case\"\u2014to \"save John Watson\". Although Holmes follows Mary's 'advice' by putting himself in a dangerous situation that John will have to rescue him from, John only moves to save Sherlock when he finds the DVD himself and realizes what his friend is doing, musing in the aftermath that he is not the man Mary believed he was even if he wants to be. At the conclusion of the third episode \"The Final Problem\", John receives another posthumous DVD from Mary, in which she notes that the two of them are - basically -  a junkie who solves crime to get high and a doctor who never came back from the war, but that what truly matters is that the two of them maintain the \"last refuge for the desperate\" at 221B Baker Street. Mary smiles as she reflects that they will always be her 'Baker Street Boys', answering the strange cases that nobody else can solve when people truly need help. She also claims that \"who you really are, it doesn\u2019t matter\".(Main series 3-4)\n\n===Eurus Holmes===\n'''Eurus Holmes''' ([[Sian Brooke]], and by [[Indica Watson]] as a child) is Sherlock and Mycroft's \"secret\" sister. Eurus is indirectly referred to in \"[[His Last Vow]]\"; when discussing Sherlock, Mycroft declares \"I am not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion. You know what happened to the other one\". She first appears in disguise in \"[[The Six Thatchers]]\" as a potential romantic interest for Watson, and then in two alternate disguises: Watson's therapist and Faith Smith in \"[[The Lying Detective]]\". She reveals her true identity in the conclusion of the episode, shooting Watson with a [[tranquilizer]] dart.\n\nIn \"[[The Final Problem (Sherlock)|The Final Problem]]\", Mycroft explains that Eurus was the youngest child, possessing a transcendent intellect greater than that of [[Isaac Newton]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arianedevere.livejournal.com/91118.html|title=Sherlock, Season 4, episode 3 transcript: The Final Problem, part 1}}</ref> For all her intelligence, however, she is unable to comprehend human feeling, once [[self harm|slicing at her arm]] to see the function of her own muscles and having to ask the meaning of pain. After a traumatic experience where she was involved in the death of Sherlock's childhood best friend (with Sherlock reinventing his friend as the dog \"Redbeard\" to lessen the emotional pain) and later burning down the Holmes family estate, she was institutionalized, with Sherlock then repressing any memory of her well into adulthood. Later in life, on Mycroft's recommendation, she was transferred to [[Sherrinford Holmes|Sherrinford]], a [[Prison#Security levels|maximum security]] psychiatric facility located on an island. Her death was also faked, with her parents being informed she had perished after starting another fire whilst incarcerated. Despite her incarceration, Eurus was occasionally consulted for her insight into potential threats, deducing the last three major attempted terrorist attacks on Britain after an hour on [[Twitter]], in exchange for 'favours', which included five minutes of unsupervised conversation with Moriarty. Having taken subtle control of the Sherrinford staff through her skills in manipulation, Eurus traps Sherlock, John, and Mycroft in a game which culminates in her ordering Sherlock to shoot either John or Mycroft, only to tranquilise the three of them when Sherlock threatens to shoot himself instead.\n\nAt the conclusion, with John trapped in the well where a young Eurus drowned Sherlock's childhood friend, Sherlock deduces that a childish song she gave as the only 'clue' to what she had done was actually a code. The code leads him to her childhood room in the abandoned Holmes estate, allowing Sherlock to save Watson by making a genuinely emotional appeal to Eurus, finally providing her with the brotherly love she never received as a child. She is returned to incarceration, although she and Sherlock are able to communicate through playing the [[violin]], which she taught him to play.\n== Metropolitan Police personnel ==\n===Sgt. Sally Donovan {{anchor|Sgt Sally Donovan|Sergeant Sally Donovan|Sally Donovan}} ===\n'''Sergeant Sally Donovan''' ([[Vinette Robinson]]) is often seen working with DI Lestrade on cases. Donovan resents Sherlock's presence at crime scenes and treats him with extreme disrespect and rudeness, cruelly calling him a \"freak\" to his face, and warns Watson that Sherlock is a [[psychopath]] who will one day get bored of catching killers and become one himself.\n\nIn \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", she is having an affair with Anderson, which Sherlock reveals, severely embarrassing the pair, and in [[The Reichenbach Fall]] she is the first police officer to fall for Moriarty's deception and believe that Sherlock may be behind the recent theft and kidnapping. Her image and Anderson's appeared in a montage during ''The Empty Hearse'', when a news reporter asked why the police let the accusations against Sherlock go so far. In \"[[The Sign of Three]]\", she's shown to be very supportive of Lestrade when it comes to difficult cases Sherlock isn't involved in.\n\nIn the pilot episode she was played by [[Zawe Ashton]] and portrayed as a uniformed officer, rather than a detective.\n\n===Philip Anderson===\n'''Philip Anderson''' ([[Jonathan Aris]]) is originally a member of the Metropolitan Police's Forensic Services. From the series opening, it is clear that Anderson and Sherlock have history of mutual dislike with Sherlock repeatedly humiliating Anderson and Anderson refusing to assist him at crime scenes.\n\nIn \"[[A Study in Pink]],\" Sherlock reveals, to both their embarrassment, Anderson and Sgt. Donovan's affair. He later deduces Anderson's wife has left him. Also in that episode, Anderson, who has at least some familiarity with German, concludes that the letters that the dying Jennifer Wilson, poisoned by the [[Taxicab|cabbie]] Jeff Hope, carved into the floor with her fingernail, \"Rache,\" spell the German word for \"revenge.\" In \"[[The Reichenbach Fall]],\" Anderson is the second person at The Yard to be deceived by Moriarty into thinking Sherlock may be involved in the recent theft and kidnapping.\n\nHe appears in the mini-episode \"Many Happy Returns\" where it is revealed that he has lost his job with the police and is trying to convince Lestrade that Sherlock is not only alive but also is still solving mysteries across the globe.\n\nHis first name is not mentioned until the opening episode of series 3, \"The Empty Hearse\". In the third season, he has become one of Sherlock's most avid fans, the founder of \"The Empty Hearse\", a club which believes Sherlock to have faked his death during the events of \"The Reichenbach Fall\", and a rather avid conspiracy theorist regarding his fall. Sherlock deduces that this is due to his guilt at having been eager to believe Moriarty's manipulations and having been a prime instrument in Sherlock's \"death.\" By the end of \"The Empty Hearse\", Sherlock tells Anderson a possible explanation of how he escaped death (it is never revealed if it was false or not, though some aspects of this particular explanation are later proven to be the truth). Anderson is initially disappointed with the explanation, and as Sherlock leaves, he tries to prove that it is fake, before having the revelation that he is the last person Sherlock would come to, to reveal the truth about his death. He is left collapsing into hysterical laughter, ripping all his evidence from his walls.\n\nIn \"His Last Vow\", Anderson is called upon by Mycroft and John to inspect Sherlock's flat for drugs. After Sherlock reveals that he's going against Magnussen, Anderson is threatened by Mycroft into never speaking of what he heard. Mary later questions him along with others that know Sherlock to find out where he is, with him supposedly \"following\" (or rather stalking) Sherlock to a safe house.\n\n==Villains==\n===Irene Adler===\n'''[[Irene Adler]]''' ([[Lara Pulver]]) is featured in \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\" as a [[dominatrix]], known professionally as \"The Woman\". She takes pictures of her clients during her job as \"protection\" to make sure her clients don't do anything unfavourable to her. Irene is brilliant enough to impress Sherlock, and managed to deceive him; however, she also ends up falling in love with him, which proves to be her downfall. She sends Sherlock a series of flirtatious texts, repeatedly requesting to \"have dinner\" with him.\n\nHaving taken a picture of the information for \"Bond Air\", she was targeted by Americans, who were working with the British government to trick terrorists into thinking that their bomb would blow up a plane and take the lives of hundreds. She was also sought out by Mycroft for incriminating photos of herself and one of her clients, a young (and female) member of the [[House of Windsor]]. She contacted Moriarty about the Bond Air plan, being given advice on how to use it to her advantage. She successfully duped Sherlock into revealing what Bond Air was about, texting the answer to Moriarty, who informed the terrorists.\n\nFacing off with both the \"Holmes Boys\", Irene attempted to get a list of demands fulfilled; however, Sherlock figured out the password to her phone \u2013 \"I am SHER-Locked.\" With her protection gone, Irene was left to the mercy of any who were after her. Though it was reported she was beheaded by extremists in Karachi some time later, Sherlock had helped her fake her death.\n\nShe makes a return in \"The Signs of Three\", as a mental image when Sherlock thinks of those who know John's middle name; he tells the image \"Out of my head, I'm busy.\" In \"His Last Vow\", when Charles Augustus Magnussen is \"reading\" Sherlock's list of pressure points (weaknesses), the list on the screen scrolls on for some time (and Magnussen mocks Sherlock by saying that he has \"rather a lot\"). However, there are actually only six pressure points listed, and to achieve the effect of there being many of them, they are repeated several times. They are: ''Irene Adler (See File); Jim Moriarty (See File); Redbeard (See File); [[Hounds of Baskerville|Hounds of the Baskerville]]; [[Opium]];'' and ''John Watson''. She was later mentioned by Jim Moriarty in a scene taking place in Sherlock's mind palace, when he tells Sherlock that \"... Mummy and Daddy will cry ... and The Woman will cry\" in a surreal sequence where Sherlock, who is suffering from a near-fatal gunshot wound and has retreated to his mind palace to find a way to keep himself alive, imagines himself in a room where Moriarty is chained. Her picture is also seen during \"The Abominable Bride\" where Sherlock keeps it inside his watch. She is mentioned again in \"[[The Lying Detective]]\", when her text alert noise comes on during Sherlock and John's conversation. In \"The Final Problem\", Sherlock admits she still texts him, though states he never replies.\n[[File:Lars Mikkelsen.jpg|thumb|[[Lars Mikkelsen]] plays [[The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton|Charles Augustus Magnussen]]]]\n\n===Charles Augustus Magnussen===\n'''Charles Augustus Magnussen''' ([[Lars Mikkelsen]]), who is shown briefly in \"[[The Empty Hearse]]\" and appears prominently in \"[[His Last Vow]]\", is a powerful businessman who controls a media empire.  He holds information on many people of prominence, allowing him to use such information for blackmail purposes in order to achieve his goals; Sherlock has nicknamed him \"the Napoleon of Blackmail\" and is repulsed by him, far more than any killer he has dealt with. Like Sherlock, he uses the [[Method of loci|mind palace]] technique to store the information in his head, keeping no hard copies or physical evidence with him unless he specifically needs to have them obtained. Magnussen is based on the original character of Charles Augustus Milverton, the titular character of the short story \"[[The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton]]\". In \"The Sign of Three\", he sends a telegram to the Watsons' wedding, signing it \"CAM\", which are his initials. In \"His Last Vow\", Magnussen reveals he has gathered blackmail information on Mary Watson to control Sherlock through John Watson, hoping to gain power over Mycroft, and by extension, the entire British Government. Sherlock prevents his doing so and frees everyone from his power by shooting Magnussen in the head, having failed to successfully trap him. In \"The Six Thatchers\", Mycroft arranges for the video footage of Magnussen's death to be doctored so it would appear that he was shot by \"some overeager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger\", clearing Sherlock of his murder.[[File:Toby Jones.jpg|thumb|[[Toby Jones]] portrays Culverton Smith|222x222px]]\n\n===Culverton Smith===\n'''Culverton Smith''' ([[Toby Jones]]), is featured in \"[[The Lying Detective]]\". A prominent entrepreneur and philanthropist, Smith is secretly a serial killer, who doesn't kill out of hate or love, but for the pleasure of killing. Using his wealth and unassailable power, he is able to use his charity-funded hospital as a way to go into patient's rooms and then kill them, taking inspiration from [[H. H. Holmes]]. Smith also has an uncontrollable need to confess to his crimes, going as far as to confess to his closest friends, even his daughter Faith, but making them forget his crimes through the use of memory inhibiting drugs. Sherlock comes up against Smith when Faith gives him a slip of paper that she wrote down, reminding her of fragments of the crimes Smith told her. Sherlock comes to suspect Smith of being a serial killer, garnering media attention, which forces Sherlock and John to go with Smith to his hospital. After Sherlock tries to attack Smith with a scalpel, he is taken in as a patient to recuperate from drugs. Smith attempts to kill Sherlock, believing him to be a threat. Sherlock manages to make Smith confess, and his confession is recorded, and thus Smith is arrested. After being interrogated by Lestrade, Smith finds that confessing was more enjoyable than he imagined, and \"should've done it sooner\". He also realizes that this confession will make him even more famous, and that he may be able to \"break America\".\n\n==Other characters==\n===Anthea===\n'''Anthea''' ([[Lisa McAllister]]) is an assistant to Mycroft Holmes, who appears in \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\", and \"[[The Empty Hearse]]\". She picks the name at random when John asks what he should call her.\n\n===Janine Hawkins===\n'''Janine Hawkins''' ([[Yasmine Akram]]) is Mary Morstan's bridesmaid in \"[[The Sign of Three]]\". She is the personal assistant of Magnussen, the villain of ''[[His Last Vow]]'', in which it is revealed that both Mary and Sherlock independently befriended her in order to get access to him. Sherlock went so far as to enter a relationship with her. He had kept her at arm's length the entire time, not wanting her to be involved too much; he even pretended that he worked night shifts, so he couldn't engage in any sexual encounters with her. Pretending to propose to her, Sherlock succeeds in getting into Magnussen's penthouse; however, Mary had rendered Janine unconscious moments before.\n\nDuring their final encounter, Janine admits that she has made a lot of money since then by going on talk shows about her relationship with the famous detective, and had bought herself a nice cottage in Sussex. It is unclear whether that was her original intention or improvised for revenge. Most of the stories that she publicized were made-up to sell better. Sherlock and Janine agree that this makes them even, and she leaves amicably, although she insists that he should not have lied to her.\n\nJanine also appears in a cameo in \"[[The Abominable Bride]]\", as a member of the sororital conspiracy Sherlock discovers.\n\n=== Mr. and Mrs. Holmes ===\n'''Mr. and Mrs. Holmes''' ([[Timothy Carlton]] and [[Wanda Ventham]], the real-life parents of Benedict Cumberbatch), Sherlock, Mycroft, and Eurus' parents, appear in Series Three and Four. They are introduced in [[The Empty Hearse]] when John comes into the flat at Baker Street to find an older couple seated in the sitting room, speaking to Sherlock. He assumes that this couple are clients, but Sherlock's conversation with them eventually implies that they know one another. After they leave, Sherlock explains to John that they are in fact his parents. John is hurt when he discovers that the reason that Mr. and Mrs. Holmes did not attend Sherlock's funeral was because Sherlock had told them, unlike John, that he was alive.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Holmes are shown to be patient and accepting parents to their highly intelligent but socially impaired sons. As the two of them chat with Sherlock during the scene in which they are first introduced, neither parent appears too surprised when Sherlock abruptly steps up onto the coffee table, using it as a step so he can climb onto the couch to work on a complex chart he is using to help him with an ongoing case. As he stands between them, working on this visual aid, his mother simply looks up at him and continues talking as if she does not even notice his unusual behavior. His father sighs and looks a bit annoyed, but remains polite.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Holmes also appear later in Series Three, in \"[[His Last Vow]]\". They are featured when John and Mary join the Holmes brothers at their parents' house for a somewhat awkward Christmas dinner before John and Sherlock travel to Appledore to seek out Magnussen's incriminating materials on Mary. Despite her great love for her boys, Mrs.&nbsp;Holmes is shown apparently not to fully understand, or not fully care about Mycroft's role in international security; when he complains that she has gotten potatoes on his laptop, \"on which depends the security of the free world,\" she simply tells him that he \"shouldn't leave it lying around if it's so important.\" It is from their mother, though, that the Holmes brothers get their great intellect; that Christmas, Mrs. Holmes is shown to have written a mathematical book on [[Fluid mechanics#mathematical fluid mechanics|fluid mechanics]]. Mr.&nbsp;Holmes, though not a genius, seems almost to fill a John-like role as, as Mary Watson puts it, the \"sane one.\" Both the Holmes parents seem to immediately love and accept Mary, who may represent something of a daughter-in-law to them, as neither of their own sons seem likely to marry or have children.\n\n===Lady Smallwood {{anchor|Lady Alicia Smallwood}} ===\n'''Lady Alicia Smallwood''' ([[Lindsay Duncan]]) is a member of the [[Cabinet Office]] and a colleague of Mycroft Holmes. She first appears in \"[[His Last Vow]]\" (although under the first name of Elizabeth), where she leads an inquiry onto the activities of media magnate Charles Augustus Magnussen, though he eventually blackmailed her into ceasing the investigation via her husband's sexual letters to an underage girl. She consults Sherlock into retrieving the letters from Magnussen, leading to Sherlock shooting him, when he discovers that Magnussen's knowledge of the letters (in addition to all his other blackmail material) were in his mind palace. Following Magnussen's death, she authorizes the punishment of Sherlock to be flown to a certain-death mission in Eastern Europe. When Moriarty reappears on every television in the country, she authorizes Sherlock's return to England to deal with Moriarty.\n\nLady Smallwood reappears in \"[[The Six Thatchers]]\", in a meeting with Sherlock, Mycroft, her secretary Vivian Norbury, and Sir Edwin. In the meeting, she reveals that footage of him executing Magnussen has been digitally altered to make a police [[sniper]] appear to be the shooter instead, effectively letting him \"off the hook\", rather than officially pardoning him. She reappears later in the episode when she is brought into questioning by Mycroft following the connection between her codename, \"Love\", and the codename, \"Amo\" (the Latin word for \"love\") used in a rescue operation in the British Embassy in [[Tbilisi]] which resulted in the British [[ambassador]] and several private military contractors (led by Mary Watson) being massacred. She is later proven innocent, when it is revealed that her secretary, Vivian Norbury (who had been [[espionage|selling secrets]]), was behind the mission sabotage.\n\nSmallwood later appears in \"[[The Lying Detective]]\", when she and Mycroft are tracking Sherlock when he is leaving his flat under the influence of drugs. She later questions Mycroft on \"Sherrinford\", to which he replies that \"Sherrinford\" is secure. She also gives Mycroft her personal number and suggests they go out for a drink.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1475582|Sherlock}}\n\n{{Sherlock}}\n{{HolmesFilms}}\n\n[[Category:Sherlock (TV series)|C]]\n[[Category:Sherlock Holmes characters|Sherlock]]\n[[Category:Lists of British television series characters|Sherlock characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of crime television characters|Sherlock]]\n[[Category:Lists of drama television characters|Sherlock]]\n[[Category:Sherlock Holmes lists|Sherlock characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=June 2011}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2011}}}}\n[[File:Sherlock Logo.svg|100px|right]]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2013}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Sherlock'' characters}}\nThe following is a list and description of the characters of ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', a British television series that started airing on [[BBC One]] in July 2010.

He appears as a tall, thin man with dark, curly hair. Like the original character, Sherlock is highly intelligent and able to [[Deductive reasoning|deduce]] or [[Abductive reasoning|abduce]] information from the small details. According to [[Molly Hooper]] in the episode ''[[The Sign of Three]]'', he is a graduate [[Chemistry|chemist]].\n\nSherlock has a very unusual personality, and describes himself in the first episode \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", as a \"high-functioning [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]\", a term he insists on in subsequent episodes. Others call him a \"[[psychopathy|psychopath]]\", and in \"[[The Hounds of Baskerville]]\" John Watson tells Lestrade that he believes Sherlock has [[Asperger syndrome]]. This manifests itself in very poor people skills and the extremely rude manners Sherlock shows toward everyone he deals with. At times, he also seems to exhibit [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory sensitivities]], associated with [[autism spectrum disorders]], and occasionally exhibits \"[[stimming]]\" behaviors (pacing, hopping, spinning, rocking, making origami from serviettes, flapping a hand) when excited, upset, stressed, concentrating deeply, or overwhelmed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Sherlock is an Aspie|url = http://sherlockisanaspie.tumblr.com/tagged/stimming|website = sherlockisanaspie.tumblr.com (warning: profanity present in source)|accessdate = 26 November 2015}}</ref> On two occasions in the episode [[The Hounds of Baskerville]], he also appears to suffer from episodes of [[sensory overload]] and has minor meltdowns, and fidgeting with his hand after such an episode appears to soothe him. Also a characteristic of autism, Sherlock can be shown to have a very literal understanding of what is said to him \u2013 once, when after Sherlock tells John that he wants to go out that evening, John tells him that can't because he is going on a date, describing it as \"two people who like each other [going] out and [having] fun\", Sherlock replies that \"That's what [he] was suggesting.\"  [[Nonverbal communication]] also does not seem to come naturally to him, and he appears sometimes not to understand [[sarcasm]], though he uses it often. During the episode ''[[The Six Thatchers]]'', John and Lestrade have a sarcastic conversation during which they compare Sherlock's neediness and selfishness to that of John's infant daughter, and although Sherlock is able to tell that they are making a joke about him, he does not fully comprehend. After asking them if they are making a joke, he admits that he \"doesn't get it.\" He is also disdainful of the \"typical\" affectionate relationships he sees other people sharing, referring to them as \"sentiment ... a chemical defect found on the losing side.\" He seems to admit that he [[Theory of mind|does not understand]] sentiment and does not wish to, but, as seen below, he is shown to care deeply about his closest friends. Sherlock is, however, skilled at [[Crocodile tears|feigning emotion]] and is shown successfully [[Social engineering (security)|manipulating strangers]] \u2013 mostly by playing on their weaknesses \u2013 into helping him or providing information useful for a case.  His brother Mycroft, in the first episode, says Sherlock has the mind of a [[Scholarly method|scholar]] or [[philosopher]].\n\nFurthermore, Sherlock does not seem to understand the deep emotional impact his actions have on those who care deeply about him. Though Sherlock's fake [[suicide]] at the end of \"[[The Reichenbach Fall]]\" was conducted in order to protect Sherlock's friends, including John; when, two years later, Sherlock is ready to return to [[London]] and reunite with John, he seems to [[Mind-blindness|have no idea]] of the [[Psychological pain|pain]] and [[grief]] John has suffered as the result of his \"death\". When Sherlock reveals himself to John, having disguised himself as a waiter, he is unhappily shocked at Watson's intense emotional reaction and the fact that John does not immediately accept him back into his life. After he and John have become close again, Sherlock is completely shocked when John asks him to be the best man at his and Mary's wedding, and is unable to mentally finish John's statement about wanting to be \"with the two people that [he] love[s] and care[s] about most in the world\" with his own name. Again, understanding John's words literally, when John first uses the phrase \"the best man\", Sherlock goes off on a tangent describing the \"best man\" he ever knew until John pauses him and explains that he is referring to the \"best man\" for his and Mary's upcoming wedding. During his best man speech later on in the episode, Sherlock moves everyone deeply by telling John that he is sitting \"between the woman [he has] made [his] wife and the man [he] has saved; in short, the two people who love (him) most in all this world,\" and that he was shocked because he \"never expected to be anybody's best friend. And certainly not the best friend of the bravest, and kindest and the wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing.\"\n\nSherlock seems to care more about the crimes than about the victims involved. He is rude and appears to be inconsiderate towards others, including John (often leaving him behind and asking him to do menial, domestic tasks such as shopping). However, Sherlock is shown to care deeply for John as the series goes on, showing uncharacteristic emotion when his friend's life is in jeopardy or when John comes to his aid. Sherlock states the highest compliment he can give is saying that Mary deserves John as a husband. He considers only four people as his friends: John Watson, Mrs Hudson, Molly Hooper and DI Greg Lestrade, whose first name he never remembers. He also has an extremely complex relationship with his brother Mycroft, his only admitted intellectual superior. Mycroft, from the outset, is shown to care and worry deeply for him whilst at the same time sharing a mix of mutual contempt and respect. Sherlock seems to have grown more fond of his brother as the stories progress, even pleading with Mycroft to attend John and Mary's wedding; though he was also scornful upon hearing his brother admit he'd be saddened by his death.\n\nSherlock appears largely [[Asexuality|asexual]] and describes himself as \"married to his work\". He seems oblivious to the romantic attraction that Molly has toward him in the first two series. After the introduction of Irene Adler, Sherlock seems to have some interest in Irene, though her attempts to throw him off by shocking him seem to have no effect on him; and comes to her rescue when she is about to be executed in [[Karachi]]. She frequently flirts with and texts Sherlock in \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\", but he seldom responds. In the following series, Sherlock briefly has a mental image of her in his Mind Palace when thinking of who would know John's middle name, but quickly retorts \"Out of my head, I'm busy.\" In Series 3 he is briefly in a relationship with Janine; however, this is later revealed to be a ruse to gain information on her boss, and he carefully avoids allowing the relationship to become too intense.\n\nSherlock has considerable fighting ability, fighting off a man armed with a sword using his bare hands in [[The Blind Banker]]. In [[A Scandal in Belgravia]], he disarms and incapacitates a CIA agent on two separate occasions. At the end of Series Three, seeing no other choice, he shoots and kills Charles Augustus Magnussen, a corrupt and unethical newspaper owner who is threatening to release incriminating material he has on Mary Watson. Instead of going to prison, Sherlock is sent to do dangerous undercover work in Central Europe; this is interrupted by the shocking revelation at the end of Series Three of [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]]'s survival. Sherlock also enjoys dancing; proudly demonstrating a perfect pirouette to Janine in [[The Sign of Three]] during the reception of John and Mary's wedding and lamenting the fact that dancing \"never really comes up in crime work\". In the same episode, shortly after he deduces Mary's [[pregnancy]], Sherlock explains that he is the one who taught John to dance.\n\nHe knows the streets and alleys of London extremely well; in [[A Study in Pink]], he quickly figures out what route a cab would take and plans a route to beat it to its destination. In [[The Empty Hearse]], Sherlock works out which paths to take to shave time off the countdown to save John. He has strange connections, including a [[graffiti artist]], as well as the entire network of the homeless (similar to the [[Baker Street Irregulars]]' street urchins in the original stories). In solving cases, Sherlock uses a technique known as the [[Method of Loci]], which he calls his \"mind palace\", which enables him to efficiently store and retrieve information for deductions. Initially the mind palace appears as a series of assorted facts that appear on the screen when a scene is shown from Sherlock's point of view. In series 3, the mind palace became a very elaborate construction where other characters from the series discuss Sherlock's cases with him.\n\nSherlock has violent mood swings when there are no cases that interest him. He is once seen stretched out on his chair and firing a gun at a smiley face spray-painted on the wall in his flat. He finds smoking impractical in present-day urban London and, therefore, mostly makes do with [[nicotine patch]]es. He may apply three patches at the same time when it is a \"three patch problem\", implying the nicotine helps him to think. For the same reason, he plays the [[violin]] and even composes music from time to time. Sherlock also has a history of [[recreational drug use]]; solving dangerous cases, as he puts it, \"as an alternative to getting high.\" Seen in [[His Last Vow]], Sherlock has a short fuse when high or recovering, shoving Mycroft against the wall of the flat and painfully twisting one arm behind him; John was concerned in this scene that Sherlock would seriously injure his brother.\n\nDespite the challenges Sherlock presents toward potential friends, John is extremely loyal to his flatmate. In Series Three, after Sherlock returns from his two-year absence, John selects Sherlock to be the [[Groomsman|best man]] at his and Mary's wedding. The speech Sherlock gives is somewhat awkward, with his demeanor showing how uncomfortable he is with making a speech in front of strangers,<ref name=\":0\" /> and his apparent lack of understanding when a number of deeply moved guests begin to sniffle and was extremely touched John abruptly hugs him. Although Sherlock is not generally a \"hugger,\" in the episode [[The Lying Detective]], when John, who is still mourning for Mary, begins to cry, Sherlock, without being asked, takes John in his arms and holds him as he cries.\n\nTrying to prevent anyone, specifically the press, from getting a photograph of his face, Sherlock disguises it with a modern cap styled after a classic [[deerstalker]]. This becomes his trademark\u2014much to his annoyance as he greatly dislikes the hat, describing it in [[The Reichenbach Fall]] as a \"death [[Flying disc|Frisbee]]\" and expressing confusion about the advantage this hat, according to its name, would provide to a person hunting deer. He concludes that as this hat has ear flaps, it is an \"ear hat.\" However, he seems to have accepted the fact that the hat is now his trademark since he puts one on before greeting the press about his miraculous return in [[The Empty Hearse]]. Sherlock is also shown not to enjoy eating; in \"[[The Blind Banker]]\", he explains to Molly Hooper that he doesn't eat while he's working, as digesting slows him down. In the pilot episode of the show, he tells John that he does not eat every day, and later in the episode, John uses the fact that Sherlock has not eaten in several days to convince Lestrade to allow Sherlock to leave the scene of the [[Taxicab|cabbie]] Jeff Hope's death \u2013 in order to go and eat dinner \u2013 instead of staying to share his deductions with the police force.\n\n===Dr. John Watson {{anchor|Dr. Watson}} ===\n[[File:Martin Freeman during filming of Sherlock cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Freeman]] as [[Dr. Watson|John Watson]]]]\n'''[[Dr. Watson|John Hamish Watson]]''' ([[Martin Freeman]]) is Sherlock's best friend. He is often a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to Sherlock in both appearance and personality. Unlike Sherlock, John is short with [[blond]] hair. He is friendly, compassionate, and patient, compared to Sherlock's aloof, cold-hearted tendencies. He gets on better with the police and takes care of practical matters at their flat, apparently doing most of the shopping. Sherlock has called him \"the wisest, warmest human being [he] knows\", and has stated that \"the warmth and constancy of [John's] friendship\" can redeem even a \"rude, ignorant, all-around obnoxious arsehole like [Sherlock].\"\n\nJohn seems to behave as Sherlock's advocate, helping strangers to understand what they should expect from Sherlock as he helps Sherlock to behave in socially acceptable ways. He calmly but sternly corrects Sherlock when he is brash and tries to get him to understand \"typical\" human emotions, which Sherlock snidely refers to as \"sentiment\", to him. John is very tolerant and understanding; as Sherlock's [[Roommate|flatmate]] he has to deal with everything from coming home to find Sherlock shooting holes in the wall to opening the refrigerator and discovering a severed human head. He is shown to, in general, be very protective of Sherlock and his quirks; when, at the beginning of \"[[The Hounds of Baskerville]]\", Sherlock is angrily pacing the sitting room of their flat, desperate for a case, John encourages him and tries to help him find something to do, although, after Sherlock's deduction of Mrs. Hudson proves extremely insulting, John tells him off and insists he apologize. One thing John will not do with Sherlock, however, is play the game [[Cluedo]]; Sherlock's frustration that the inflexible rules of the game do not allow for scenarios that resemble realistic cases has apparently ruined the game for John. After he becomes engaged to [[Minor Sherlock Holmes characters|Mary Morstan]] in Series Three, John develops a [[code]] with Mary that they use when one of them realizes that they need to privately discuss an issue Sherlock is having.\n\nAt the start of the series, John is recently invalided home from [[Afghanistan]] after serving with the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] as part of [[Operation Herrick|Britain's role in the 2001\u20132014 Afghanistan war]]. He was honourably discharged as a Captain. Prior to his military period, John read [[medicine]] at [[King's College London]], as seen on his [[Curriculum vitae|CV]]. He is in possession of a [[SIG-Sauer P226|service pistol]], with which he is highly proficient, being described as a \"crack shot\" by Sherlock. He often uses his former position to help Sherlock and him get into high security places (like in The Hound of Baskerville).\n\nAt the beginning of the series, John has several medical issues: a [[psychosomatic]] limp in his right leg, a bullet wound in his left shoulder, and an \"intermittent [[tremor]]\" in his left hand. John's therapist notes he has \"trust issues\" and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]], but Sherlock's brother, Mycroft, says that he is far from being \"haunted by the war\" and that John actually misses the thrill of battle. Following a chase around London with Sherlock, in which he forgets his cane at a restaurant, John's limp disappears, and Mycroft observes that in a stressful situation John has no sign of a hand tremor. When asked by Sherlock, on their first case together, whether he wants to see more horrible deaths, John responds, \"Oh God, yes!\" In the 3rd series, it is further elaborated that John is subconsciously addicted to danger. Sherlock explains that this is why John chose to put his trust in him, a sociopath who solves dangerous cases as an alternative to getting high, and fell in love with Mary, a former [[secret agent]] and assassin.\n\nJohn is shown to be dependable and brave, with a strong sense of personal integrity. He refuses Mycroft's offer to pay him to spy on Sherlock, despite only having just met Sherlock; however, Series 3 shows John informing Mycroft of anything wrong Sherlock has done, showing he will inform others of Sherlock's actions if they are family. He is willing to use deadly force and shows impressive physical strength; in the episode [[A Scandal in Belgravia]], when a confused Sherlock, who has been rendered ill by [[Irene Adler|Irene Adler's]] poison, gets out of bed to search for her and falls, John is able to lift him from the floor to return him to bed.\n\nIn the first series John gets a [[locum]] job at a nearby general practice to supplement his [[pension]]. In the second series, John is referred to as Sherlock's [[Personal Assistant|P.A.]] and is not shown working any other job. John writes about Sherlock's cases on his [[blog]], which attracts clients to them. He also gives the cases names he deems appropriate.\n\nMuch to John's constant annoyance, he is often mistaken for a [[Homosexuality|gay man]] because of the time he spends around Sherlock. In the pilot episode, when John first meets Sherlock and begins working with him, many assume they are now a couple. When waiting in a restaurant for the cabbie to arrive, the restaurant owner, Angelo, tells Sherlock that he and \"his date\" can have anything they want on the menu for free. John insists that he's not Sherlock's date, however Sherlock remains quiet. When John meets Mycroft for the first time, Mycroft asks \"Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?\u201d in reference to the fact that John quickly moved in with Sherlock after meeting him. He is indicated to have had a number of short-lived relationships with women \u2013 one of whom is shown breaking up with him due to John's commitment to Sherlock, saying angrily \"You\u2019re a great boyfriend. Sherlock is a very lucky man.\" In Series 3, when he tells Mrs. Hudson that he is engaged, she asks \"So, what's his name?\"\n\nThe only member of John's family who has been alluded to thus far is his sister, Harriet (aka Harry), with whom he has an estranged relationship due to her being a [[Alcoholism|heavy drinker]] and the separation of her and her ex-wife, Clara. During their first case together, Sherlock deduces that John had refused to accept help from Harry after being invalided out of the army, even though the fact that she gave John her old phone is an indication that she wants to stay in touch with her brother. John was not too surprised when she didn't show up to his wedding, noting a free bar would have been a bad mix with Harry around. Sherlock also guesses that John's extended family is not very close to him.\n\nJohn' middle name is revealed to be Hamish, as originally suggested by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] to explain discrepancies in John's name between several of Conan Doyle's stories.<ref>[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], \"Dr. Watson's Christian Name\", in ''Unpopular Opinions'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1946), 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\n===D.I. Greg Lestrade {{anchor|Lestrade|DI Lestrade|Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade|Greg Lestrade}} ===\n[[File:Rupert Graves 2010 cropped.jpg|thumb|226x226px|[[Rupert Graves]] plays [[Inspector Lestrade|Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade]]]]\n'''[[Inspector Lestrade|Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade]]''' ([[Rupert Graves]]) works for Scotland Yard. He has a reluctant respect for Sherlock and often defends him from the other police officers' animosity. He is often frustrated by Sherlock's cryptic deductions and habit of withholding evidence, but believes that he is a great man (hoping that one day, he can overcome his poorer qualities, and become a \"good\" man).\n\nIn \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", he mentions that he is in an on-again-off-again relationship with his ex-wife. In \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\", Lestrade says he and his wife have settled their problems, but Sherlock flatly informs him that she is (as of Christmas that year) sleeping with a [[Physical education|P.E.]] teacher.\n\nIn \"[[The Reichenbach Fall]]\", Lestrade agrees to bring Sherlock in for questioning and it becomes apparent that Lestrade's superiors were not aware of Sherlock's involvement in cases. Unlike Donovan and Anderson, Lestrade had complete faith that Sherlock was innocent of any wrongdoing, proving just how much he trusted him. Later in the same story, Lestrade is one of three people identified by Moriarty as Sherlock's friends (the other two being John and Mrs Hudson). In \"[[The Sign of Three]]\", Lestrade's faith in Sherlock is shown to have escalated to comical levels, and he drops all pressing matters to comply with his requests (which proves to be embarrassing when Sherlock's request for help was revealed to be motivated by nothing more than a desire for assistance in writing his best man speech for John's wedding).\n\nBy the fourth season, Sherlock and Lestrade's relationship, while still strained, has become notably better, as Sherlock's interaction with John helps him be a better person. After a traumatic case involving the Holmes' psychotic sister, Eurus, which was ended when Sherlock made a genuinely emotional plea to her as he acknowledged her condition, Lestrade noted at the case's conclusion that Sherlock was \"a good man\", able to recognize the human element that he had once lacked.\n\nAlthough Lestrade is ranked as 'DI,' i.e. 'Detective Inspector,', the Lestrade in the original novels was ranked as Inspector (the rank of 'DI' not having been created at that time.) A running joke in the series is that Sherlock consistently fails to remember Lestrade's first name, with Lestrade noting that Sherlock remembering his name properly is a sign of his social improvement.\n\n===Mrs. Hudson===\n[[File:Una Stubbs, filming Sherlock (2015).jpg|thumb|[[Una Stubbs]] as [[Mrs. Hudson|Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson]] while filming for ''Sherlock''.]]\n'''[[Minor Sherlock Holmes characters#Mrs. Hudson|Martha Louise Hudson]]''', ''n\u00e9e'' '''Sissons''' ([[Una Stubbs]]) is the landlady of [[221B Baker Street]]. Sherlock won his way into her good graces after ensuring her husband, who ran a [[drug cartel]], was executed for a double murder in Florida.\n\nAlthough she repeatedly insists that she is not their [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson fusses over Sherlock as if she were, and he takes it for granted that she will provide dinner for him. She is often horrified to see Sherlock keep human body parts in his kitchen appliances (refrigerator, microwave) for experimentation. In [[A Study in Pink]], upon first meeting John, Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson thought he was Sherlock's romantic partner, and throughout the show, she is seen to still believe that they are a gay couple, despite John's repeated protests that he is not gay and that he and Sherlock are not a couple. Despite his impatience at her concern for him, Sherlock has shown to have a great deal of affection for Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson; for example while he often tells her to shut up when he considers her input an annoyance, he is quick to reprimand his brother Mycroft for attempting to do the same. In [[A Scandal in Belgravia]], Sherlock pushes a CIA agent [[Defenestration|out of a second-story window]] multiple times to punish him for torturing Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson; later in the same episode when John suggests Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson leave Baker Street for her own safety, Sherlock appears appalled at the notion and informs John 'England would fall' should such a thing happen.\n\nIt is revealed in [[His Last Vow]] (along with her full name) that she is a \"semi-reformed [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]],\" a former \"exotic dancer,\" and that her weakness is [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Sherlock later makes a jab at her past, when explaining the secrets held by the people John knew.\n\nIn the hallucinations of \"[[The Abominable Bride]]\", Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson is shown upset that she has no speaking role in Watson's stories and Sherlock suggests he \"give her some lines\" as she \"is perfectly capable of starving us\".\n\nIn \"[[The Lying Detective]]\", Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson is shown to own a very fast sports car \u2013 although she is a somewhat reckless driver \u2013 defending her possession of it by noting that she is the widow of a drug dealer who owns property in central London. Later in the episode, when Mycroft has agents turning over the flat to explain Sherlock's recent actions and finds a DVD the recently deceased Mary Watson recorded for Sherlock, Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson orders all the agents to leave her and John alone to watch the recording unless they wish to prove that they \"have no human decency\", subsequently ordering Mycroft \"Get out of my house, you reptile!\" when he remains in the room regardless. When a bomb is 'delivered' to Baker Street via drone, putting Sherlock, John, and Mycroft in a position where they will have three seconds to flee out of the room before the bomb explodes, Sherlock uses his knowledge of Mrs.&nbsp;Hudson's routine to calculate when would be the safest time to leave the room so that she will be unharmed by the blast, as she was initially hoovering directly beneath them.\n\n===Mycroft Holmes===\n[[File:Mark Gatiss at A Scandal in Belgravia screening.png|thumb|237x237px|[[Mark Gatiss]] plays [[Mycroft Holmes]]]]\n'''[[Mycroft Holmes]]''' (played by the show's executive producer, co-creator, and writer [[Mark Gatiss]]) is first introduced when he abducts John and offers to pay him to spy on Sherlock. He is Sherlock's older brother and engages in [[sibling rivalry]] with Sherlock. Mycroft is frequently mocked by Sherlock for \u201c[[weight gain|putting on weight]]\u201d. He occupies a \"minor position in the British government\"; however, as with many Holmes-based works, it is heavily hinted that he has a much bigger role than he claims \u2013 on one occasion, Sherlock sarcastically remarks that Mycroft ''is'' the British government \"when he\u2019s not too busy being the [[British secret services|British Secret Services]], or the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] on a freelance basis\". He is driven around in a private car with his [[personal assistant]] who goes by the name of \"Anthea\".\n\nJust as in the Doyle books, Mycroft is even more skilled at deduction, correcting Sherlock on occasion and beating him in deduction exercises, as well as lacking enthusiasm for \"legwork\". His intellect is borderline superhuman, allowing him to learn [[Serbian language|Serbian]] in a couple of hours (with Sherlock even noting that he once was capable of learning it much faster). As such, even Sherlock admits that Mycroft is smarter than he is; in reference to their childhood, Mycroft thought Sherlock was \"an idiot\", only changing his mind when they compared themselves with other children.\n\nDespite not paying John like he originally suggested, Mycroft is kept informed of anything his brother does that may be illegal, as seen in \u201c[[His Last Vow]]\u201d, where John informs him Sherlock had seemingly relapsed back into his old [[Substance abuse|drug habits]]. Though concerned, Mycroft jokes it would be safer for Sherlock to [[Cross-dressing|cross-dress]] like their uncle.\n\nMycroft knows his brother well, saying Sherlock considers himself a dragon-slayer; the villains Sherlock catches are the equivalent of dragons. In Mycroft's opinion, Sherlock has \"the mind of philosopher or scientist, yet he elects to be a detective\". However, he considers this an improvement, since as a child, Sherlock initially wanted to be a [[Piracy|pirate]]. Charles Augustus Magnussen in [[His Last Vow]] reveals Mycroft to be in the [[Secret Intelligence Service]].\n\nThe brothers have been seen challenging each other's wits throughout the series, and enjoy playing ''[[Operation (game)|Operation]]'' as though it were a [[chess]] game. Cigarette addiction is something Mycroft shares with Sherlock; Sherlock remarks that Mycroft can only handle low tar cigarettes and thus \"smokes like a beginner\". Sherlock also declares to John that Mycroft has [[Obsessive Compulsive Disorder|OCD]].\n\nIn \"The Abominable Bride\", in Sherlock's [[Method of loci|Mind Palace]], Mycroft is shown to be [[morbidly obese]] and engaging in a bet with Sherlock as to how long he has before dying. (Recurring series 1. Main series 2\u2013)\n\n===Molly Hooper===\n[[File:Loobrealeyheadshot.jpg|thumb|230x230px|[[Louise Brealey]] plays Molly Hooper]]\n'''Molly Hooper''' ([[Louise Brealey]]) is a 31-year-old [[specialist registrar]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-11-01/meet-the-cast-of-clique/ |title=Meet the cast of Clique |work=[[Radio Times]] |accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> working in the morgue at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] with an apparent crush on Sherlock. Due to her work position and crush on him, Sherlock frequently exploits her to let him examine or perform experiments on victims' bodies, such as in Sherlock's first scene in \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", beating them with a [[Crop (implement)|riding crop]] in order to study postmortem [[Bruise|bruising]]. In \"The Great Game\", she was in a relationship with an [[Information technology|IT]] employee named Jim, later revealed to be Moriarty, who was using her to see Sherlock up close.\n\nSherlock only finds out how deeply infatuated she is with him during \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\", when he acidly deduces that the Christmas present at the top of her bag is better wrapped than the others, and must be for someone she loves, and then discovers it's for him; she received a very uncharacteristic kiss on the cheek and apology for this. In \"[[The Reichenbach Fall]]\", Sherlock turns to her to help him fake his death. At one point, Molly points out how sad Sherlock looks when he thinks John cannot see him. He states that she can see him to which she replies that she does not count. Sherlock later tells her that she does count, that she has always counted and that he has always trusted her. When she asks what he needs, he replies with \"you\".\n\nIn \"[[The Empty Hearse]]\", while John is recovering from the hurt and shock of discovering Sherlock is still alive, she accompanies Holmes on some casework. It is revealed that she was a confidante and a key element when Sherlock faked his death. Sherlock also tells her that Moriarty made a mistake in believing that she did not matter to him, when he, in fact, admits to her that she was \"the one person who mattered the most\". During the first two episodes of the third season, she is engaged to Tom (Ed Birch) who looks and dresses quite a bit like Sherlock. In \"The Sign of Three\", Molly stabs Tom with a plastic fork when he interrupts Sherlock. By \"His Last Vow\", the engagement has been broken off\u2014Sherlock observes she is not wearing her engagement ring. During her engagement to Tom, when Molly mentions the intimacy she and Tom are sharing, Sherlock appears confused.\n\nIn \"The Abominable Bride\", Molly appears disguised as a man (also named \"Hooper\") who runs the morgue, and is extremely irritable towards Sherlock; John sees through her disguise, identifying her as a woman trying to get ahead in a \"male world\"; he remarks that the perception of such things is something that Sherlock is unusually bad at.\n\nIn \"The Six Thatchers\", John and Mary ask Molly (along with Mrs. Hudson and a reluctant Sherlock) to be a godparent for their daughter Rosie. During the episode, Molly babysits Rosie on several occasions as John and Mary assist Sherlock. When Mary is killed, Molly stays with John to look after the baby and informs Sherlock that John wants nothing to do with him.\n\nIn \"[[The Final Problem (Sherlock)|The Final Problem]]\", Sherlock's deranged sister threatens to detonate a bomb in Molly's flat unless he can phone her and get her to say the words 'I love you' without revealing that she is in danger. Sherlock is forced to say \"I love you\" to Molly. He says it twice in desperation, and afterwards, Molly finally says it too. After this scene, Sherlock proceeds to break the coffin that was supposed to be hers in a very agitated state, thus showing how much he cares for his friend. In an interview, Steven Moffat said that \"In the end of that scene, she\u2019s a bit wounded by it all\",<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/sherlock-season-4-finale-louise-brealey-steven-moffat-molly-hooper-a7532046.html%7D|title=Louise Brealey says she disagrees with Sherlock writer over Molly scene |date=17 January 2017 }}</ref> but also that \"Molly was fine\".<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/>\n\nMolly was originally intended to be a one-off character to introduce Sherlock, but Brealey impressed Moffat and Gatiss and they \"couldn\u2019t resist bringing her back\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Wells |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/may/21/sherlock-reichenbach-fall-live-chat|title=Sherlock: The Reichenbach Fall - live chat with the co-creators |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 May 2012 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> (Recurring series&nbsp;1. Main series&nbsp;2\u2013)\n\n=== Jim Moriarty {{anchor|James Moriarty|Moriarty}} ===\n[[File:Pride 04 (15269391641).jpg|thumb|243x243px|[[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] plays [[Professor Moriarty|James Jim Moriarty]]]]\n'''[[Professor Moriarty|James \"Jim\" Moriarty]]''' ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]) is a \"consulting criminal\", a counterpoint to Sherlock's similarly unrivaled \"consulting detective\". He is responsible for the criminals and crimes in all three episodes of the first series, acting as a sponsor, an informant, or a mastermind. His interest in Sherlock borders on obsession, though he does not hesitate trying to kill him when he loses interest. Like Sherlock, he possesses a genius level intellect and appears to be motivated by boredom rather than money or power.\n\nHe is an excellent actor, frequently shown to have convinced others that he is someone else \u2013 indeed his first appearance occurs as a [[gay]] man whom Molly is seeing, and Sherlock does not realise his identity at the time. In \"The Great Game\", Moriarty forces Sherlock to solve mysteries within a time limit, taking hostages to ensure that Sherlock is sufficiently motivated.\n\nIn the second series, he continues in his role as consulting criminal, giving [[Irene Adler]] advice on how to manipulate \"The Holmes Boys\", having given them both nicknames. It is mentioned that he asked for nothing in return, becoming involved just to cause trouble. He is seen briefly at the end of \"The Hounds of Baskerville\" apparently having been captured and in the process of being released by Mycroft.\n\nMoriarty features extensively in the second series finale \"The Reichenbach Fall\", where he simultaneously breaks into the [[Tower of London]], [[HMP Pentonville]] and the [[Bank of England]], using some sort of master key code. He is tried but acquitted after [[Jury intimidation|intimidating the Jury]]. He then pretends to be an actor named Richard Brook and manipulates journalist Kitty Riley as well as the general populace into thinking he has been forced by Sherlock into portraying Jim Moriarty. After revealing to Sherlock that the key was a hoax, he forces Sherlock into committing suicide in order to save his friends, but when Sherlock realises there is a way out as long as Moriarty is alive, Moriarty shoots himself in the head.\n\nMoriarty appears in the third series in either flashbacks, alternative scenarios, or Sherlock's \"mind palace\" vignettes. It is revealed that Sherlock had spent two years dismantling Moriarty's network. However, in the closing moments of the third-season finale, \"[[His Last Vow]]\", Moriarty's face appears on televisions across Britain repeating the statement \"Did you miss me?\". Sherlock, who had just been sent on an intelligence mission that was guaranteed to result in his death, was immediately recalled to face his nemesis' schemes once more.\n\nIn the special episode \"[[The Abominable Bride]]\", set in [[Victorian era]], Moriarty and Sherlock confront at [[221B Baker Street|Baker Street]] and the [[Reichenbach Falls]]. The whole conversation, however, is just a part of Sherlock's dream in his [[Method of loci|mind palace]]. During this dream, the figment of Moriarty appears to almost succeed in killing Sherlock.\n\nMoriarty appears briefly in some of the fourth series episodes. Although Sherlock confirms that Moriarty is definitely dead, his image saying \"Did you miss me?\" recurs. In \"The Final Problem\", it is revealed that Moriarty had arranged with Mycroft to meet with Eurus Holmes for five minutes unsupervised, during which he was manipulated to do Eurus's bidding.\n\n===Mary (Morstan) Watson {{anchor|Mary Watson|Mary Morstan}} ===\n[[File:Amanda Abbington at the 2015 Laurence Olivier Awards.jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[Amanda Abbington]] plays [[Mary Morstan]]]]\n'''[[Mary Morstan|Rosamund Mary Elizabeth Morstan]]''' ([[Amanda Abbington]]) is a former assassin and a part-time [[Nursing|nurse]] in John's practice whom he met following the apparent death of Sherlock. She surprises Sherlock with her knowledge and insight into his character. She marries Watson, with Sherlock as best man.\n\nIn \"The Empty Hearse\", Mary is upset with Sherlock when they meet, since John had been through a great deal of emotional pain; however, she quickly warmed up to him, and saw that Sherlock had great challenges when it came to understanding human emotions. Knowing the great friendship John shared with Sherlock, Mary then made it her job to try to get John to forgive Sherlock.\n\nIn \"The Sign of Three,\" it is revealed that Mary is an orphan. She had another boyfriend prior to John, but is now good friends with him (from her perspective); unknown to Mary, her ex retained an unhealthy attraction to her, forcing Sherlock to intimidate him before the wedding by describing himself as \"a high-functioning sociopath... with your number.\" She seems to know how to get what she wants from both John and Sherlock. She understands both of them very well and respects their close, brotherly friendship; during \"[[The Sign of Three]]\" as the three of them sit in the flat at Baker Street planning the wedding, she realizes how much Sherlock, who is averse to change, needs to know that John still cares deeply about him and will always be his friend, and how much John also needs to connect with him, and insists that the two of them go out on a case. During this scene, Mary sees that Sherlock is afraid, as evidenced by the large number of [[Sydney Opera House]]-shaped [[origami]] [[serviette]]s he is seen to have created out of nervous energy while John and Mary had had their private conversation. She is also very patient during Sherlock's long-winded and embarrassing [[Wedding|best man speech]] at the reception of her and John's wedding, appearing to be quite amused by Sherlock's rambling, awkward, but ultimately very touching soliloquy. During the show, Mary is shown to have an unusually excellent memory and the ability to understand a skip code; clues which help Sherlock realize that all is not as it seems with Mrs. Watson. It is later revealed in \"[[His Last Vow]]\" that Mary is in fact a former intelligence agent, who went [[wiktionary:rogue#Adjective|freelance]] and eventually on the run, and might not be English. An upset John even commented she should have married Sherlock since they're so alike. She stole her identity from a dead child five years before marrying John, seemingly deliberately choosing one named Mary as she \"always liked\" her middle name. Despite all the lies she told him, she genuinely loves John and says she only sought to escape her previous life; she was prepared to shoot both Sherlock and Charles Magnussen to ensure John never learnt the truth; though, as a world-class sharpshooter, she was able to shoot Sherlock in such a way that he would be hospitalized but would not die. At the end of the third series, Mary is pregnant with a daughter.\n\nIn \"The Six Thatchers\", Mary gives birth to her and John's daughter, whom they name Rosamund (which is revealed to be her real first name). More information about her past is revealed, when a former member of A.G.R.A. (a freelance special forces unit) attempts to track her down, blaming her for betraying their squad during a failed mission in Tbilisi, Georgia which resulted in his capture and torture. Sherlock works out the traitor was government official Vivian Norbury, whom he and Mary confront in the London Aquarium. As Mycroft and the police arrive, Norbury produces a gun and shoots at Sherlock, but Mary takes the bullet and dies in John's arms. Sherlock receives a posthumous DVD message from Mary, assigning him his \"most difficult case\"\u2014to \"save John Watson\". Although Holmes follows Mary's 'advice' by putting himself in a dangerous situation that John will have to rescue him from, John only moves to save Sherlock when he finds the DVD himself and realizes what his friend is doing, musing in the aftermath that he is not the man Mary believed he was even if he wants to be. At the conclusion of the third episode \"The Final Problem\", John receives another posthumous DVD from Mary, in which she notes that the two of them are - basically -  a junkie who solves crime to get high and a doctor who never came back from the war, but that what truly matters is that the two of them maintain the \"last refuge for the desperate\" at 221B Baker Street. Mary smiles as she reflects that they will always be her 'Baker Street Boys', answering the strange cases that nobody else can solve when people truly need help. She also claims that \"who you really are, it doesn\u2019t matter\".(Main series 3-4)\n\n===Eurus Holmes===\n'''Eurus Holmes''' ([[Sian Brooke]], and by [[Indica Watson]] as a child) is Sherlock and Mycroft's \"secret\" sister. Eurus is indirectly referred to in \"[[His Last Vow]]\"; when discussing Sherlock, Mycroft declares \"I am not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion. You know what happened to the other one\". She first appears in disguise in \"[[The Six Thatchers]]\" as a potential romantic interest for Watson, and then in two alternate disguises: Watson's therapist and Faith Smith in \"[[The Lying Detective]]\". She reveals her true identity in the conclusion of the episode, shooting Watson with a [[tranquilizer]] dart.\n\nIn \"[[The Final Problem (Sherlock)|The Final Problem]]\", Mycroft explains that Eurus was the youngest child, possessing a transcendent intellect greater than that of [[Isaac Newton]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arianedevere.livejournal.com/91118.html|title=Sherlock, Season 4, episode 3 transcript: The Final Problem, part 1}}</ref> For all her intelligence, however, she is unable to comprehend human feeling, once [[self harm|slicing at her arm]] to see the function of her own muscles and having to ask the meaning of pain. After a traumatic experience where she was involved in the death of Sherlock's childhood best friend (with Sherlock reinventing his friend as the dog \"Redbeard\" to lessen the emotional pain) and later burning down the Holmes family estate, she was institutionalized, with Sherlock then repressing any memory of her well into adulthood. Later in life, on Mycroft's recommendation, she was transferred to [[Sherrinford Holmes|Sherrinford]], a [[Prison#Security levels|maximum security]] psychiatric facility located on an island. Her death was also faked, with her parents being informed she had perished after starting another fire whilst incarcerated. Despite her incarceration, Eurus was occasionally consulted for her insight into potential threats, deducing the last three major attempted terrorist attacks on Britain after an hour on [[Twitter]], in exchange for 'favours', which included five minutes of unsupervised conversation with Moriarty. Having taken subtle control of the Sherrinford staff through her skills in manipulation, Eurus traps Sherlock, John, and Mycroft in a game which culminates in her ordering Sherlock to shoot either John or Mycroft, only to tranquilise the three of them when Sherlock threatens to shoot himself instead.\n\nAt the conclusion, with John trapped in the well where a young Eurus drowned Sherlock's childhood friend, Sherlock deduces that a childish song she gave as the only 'clue' to what she had done was actually a code. The code leads him to her childhood room in the abandoned Holmes estate, allowing Sherlock to save Watson by making a genuinely emotional appeal to Eurus, finally providing her with the brotherly love she never received as a child. She is returned to incarceration, although she and Sherlock are able to communicate through playing the [[violin]], which she taught him to play.\n== Metropolitan Police personnel ==\n===Sgt. Sally Donovan {{anchor|Sgt Sally Donovan|Sergeant Sally Donovan|Sally Donovan}} ===\n'''Sergeant Sally Donovan''' ([[Vinette Robinson]]) is often seen working with DI Lestrade on cases. Donovan resents Sherlock's presence at crime scenes and treats him with extreme disrespect and rudeness, cruelly calling him a \"freak\" to his face, and warns Watson that Sherlock is a [[psychopath]] who will one day get bored of catching killers and become one himself.\n\nIn \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", she is having an affair with Anderson, which Sherlock reveals, severely embarrassing the pair, and in [[The Reichenbach Fall]] she is the first police officer to fall for Moriarty's deception and believe that Sherlock may be behind the recent theft and kidnapping. Her image and Anderson's appeared in a montage during ''The Empty Hearse'', when a news reporter asked why the police let the accusations against Sherlock go so far. In \"[[The Sign of Three]]\", she's shown to be very supportive of Lestrade when it comes to difficult cases Sherlock isn't involved in.\n\nIn the pilot episode she was played by [[Zawe Ashton]] and portrayed as a uniformed officer, rather than a detective.\n\n===Philip Anderson===\n'''Philip Anderson''' ([[Jonathan Aris]]) is originally a member of the Metropolitan Police's Forensic Services. From the series opening, it is clear that Anderson and Sherlock have history of mutual dislike with Sherlock repeatedly humiliating Anderson and Anderson refusing to assist him at crime scenes.\n\nIn \"[[A Study in Pink]],\" Sherlock reveals, to both their embarrassment, Anderson and Sgt. Donovan's affair. He later deduces Anderson's wife has left him. Also in that episode, Anderson, who has at least some familiarity with German, concludes that the letters that the dying Jennifer Wilson, poisoned by the [[Taxicab|cabbie]] Jeff Hope, carved into the floor with her fingernail, \"Rache,\" spell the German word for \"revenge.\" In \"[[The Reichenbach Fall]],\" Anderson is the second person at The Yard to be deceived by Moriarty into thinking Sherlock may be involved in the recent theft and kidnapping.\n\nHe appears in the mini-episode \"Many Happy Returns\" where it is revealed that he has lost his job with the police and is trying to convince Lestrade that Sherlock is not only alive but also is still solving mysteries across the globe.\n\nHis first name is not mentioned until the opening episode of series 3, \"The Empty Hearse\". In the third season, he has become one of Sherlock's most avid fans, the founder of \"The Empty Hearse\", a club which believes Sherlock to have faked his death during the events of \"The Reichenbach Fall\", and a rather avid conspiracy theorist regarding his fall. Sherlock deduces that this is due to his guilt at having been eager to believe Moriarty's manipulations and having been a prime instrument in Sherlock's \"death.\" By the end of \"The Empty Hearse\", Sherlock tells Anderson a possible explanation of how he escaped death (it is never revealed if it was false or not, though some aspects of this particular explanation are later proven to be the truth). Anderson is initially disappointed with the explanation, and as Sherlock leaves, he tries to prove that it is fake, before having the revelation that he is the last person Sherlock would come to to reveal the truth about his death. He is left collapsing into hysterical laughter, ripping all his evidence from his walls.\n\nIn \"His Last Vow\", Anderson is called upon by Mycroft and John to inspect Sherlock's flat for drugs. After Sherlock reveals that he's going against Magnussen, Anderson is threatened by Mycroft into never speaking of what he heard. Mary later questions him along with others that know Sherlock to find out where he is, with him supposedly \"following\" (or rather stalking) Sherlock to a safe house.\n\n==Villains==\n===Irene Adler===\n'''[[Irene Adler]]''' ([[Lara Pulver]]) is featured in \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\" as a [[dominatrix]], known professionally as \"The Woman\". She takes pictures of her clients during her job as \"protection\" to make sure her clients don't do anything unfavourable to her. Irene is brilliant enough to impress Sherlock, and managed to deceive him; however, she also ends up falling in love with him, which proves to be her downfall. She sends Sherlock a series of flirtatious texts, repeatedly requesting to \"have dinner\" with him.\n\nHaving taken a picture of the information for \"Bond Air\", she was targeted by Americans, who were working with the British government to trick terrorists into thinking that their bomb would blow up a plane and take the lives of hundreds. She was also sought out by Mycroft for incriminating photos of herself and one of her clients, a young (and female) member of the [[House of Windsor]]. She contacted Moriarty about the Bond Air plan, being given advice on how to use it to her advantage. She successfully duped Sherlock into revealing what Bond Air was about, texting the answer to Moriarty, who informed the terrorists.\n\nFacing off with both the \"Holmes Boys\", Irene attempted to get a list of demands fulfilled; however, Sherlock figured out the password to her phone \u2013 \"I am SHER-Locked.\" With her protection gone, Irene was left to the mercy of any who were after her. Though it was reported she was beheaded by extremists in Karachi some time later, Sherlock had helped her fake her death.\n\nShe makes a return in \"The Signs of Three\", as a mental image when Sherlock thinks of those who know John's middle name; he tells the image \"Out of my head, I'm busy.\" In \"His Last Vow\", when Charles Augustus Magnussen is \"reading\" Sherlock's list of pressure points (weaknesses), the list on the screen scrolls on for some time (and Magnussen mocks Sherlock by saying that he has \"rather a lot\"). However, there are actually only six pressure points listed, and to achieve the effect of there being many of them, they are repeated several times. They are: ''Irene Adler (See File); Jim Moriarty (See File); Redbeard (See File); [[Hounds of Baskerville|Hounds of the Baskerville]]; [[Opium]];'' and ''John Watson''. She was later mentioned by Jim Moriarty in a scene taking place in Sherlock's mind palace, when he tells Sherlock that \"... Mummy and Daddy will cry ... and The Woman will cry\" in a surreal sequence where Sherlock, who is suffering from a near-fatal gunshot wound and has retreated to his mind palace to find a way to keep himself alive, imagines himself in a room where Moriarty is chained. Her picture is also seen during \"The Abominable Bride\" where Sherlock keeps it inside his watch. She is mentioned again in \"[[The Lying Detective]]\", when her text alert noise comes on during Sherlock and John's conversation. In \"The Final Problem\", Sherlock admits she still texts him, though states he never replies.\n[[File:Lars Mikkelsen.jpg|thumb|[[Lars Mikkelsen]] plays [[The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton|Charles Augustus Magnussen]]]]\n\n===Charles Augustus Magnussen===\n'''Charles Augustus Magnussen''' ([[Lars Mikkelsen]]), who is shown briefly in \"[[The Empty Hearse]]\" and appears prominently in \"[[His Last Vow]]\", is a powerful businessman who controls a media empire.  He holds information on many people of prominence, allowing him to use such information for blackmail purposes in order to achieve his goals; Sherlock has nicknamed him \"the Napoleon of Blackmail\" and is repulsed by him, far more than any killer he has dealt with. Like Sherlock, he uses the [[Method of loci|mind palace]] technique to store the information in his head, keeping no hard copies or physical evidence with him unless he specifically needs to have them obtained. Magnussen is based on the original character of Charles Augustus Milverton, the titular character of the short story \"[[The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton]]\". In \"The Sign of Three\", he sends a telegram to the Watsons' wedding, signing it \"CAM\", which are his initials. In \"His Last Vow\", Magnussen reveals he has gathered blackmail information on Mary Watson to control Sherlock through John Watson, hoping to gain power over Mycroft, and by extension, the entire British Government. Sherlock prevents his doing so and frees everyone from his power by shooting Magnussen in the head, having failed to successfully trap him. In \"The Six Thatchers\", Mycroft arranges for the video footage of Magnussen's death to be doctored so it would appear that he was shot by \"some overeager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger\", clearing Sherlock of his murder.[[File:Toby Jones.jpg|thumb|[[Toby Jones]] portrays Culverton Smith|222x222px]]\n\n===Culverton Smith===\n'''Culverton Smith''' ([[Toby Jones]]), is featured in \"[[The Lying Detective]]\". A prominent entrepreneur and philanthropist, Smith is secretly a serial killer, who doesn't kill out of hate or love, but for the pleasure of killing. Using his wealth and unassailable power, he is able to use his charity-funded hospital as a way to go into patient's rooms and then kill them, taking inspiration from [[H. H. Holmes]]. Smith also has an uncontrollable need to confess to his crimes, going as far as to confess to his closest friends, even his daughter Faith, but making them forget his crimes through the use of memory inhibiting drugs. Sherlock comes up against Smith when Faith gives him a slip of paper that she wrote down, reminding her of fragments of the crimes Smith told her. Sherlock comes to suspect Smith of being a serial killer, garnering media attention, which forces Sherlock and John to go with Smith to his hospital. After Sherlock tries to attack Smith with a scalpel, he is taken in as a patient to recuperate from drugs. Smith attempts to kill Sherlock, believing him to be a threat. Sherlock manages to make Smith confess, and his confession is recorded, and thus Smith is arrested. After being interrogated by Lestrade, Smith finds that confessing was more enjoyable than he imagined, and \"should've done it sooner\". He also realizes that this confession will make him even more famous, and that he may be able to \"break America\".\n\n==Other characters==\n===Anthea===\n'''Anthea''' ([[Lisa McAllister]]) is an assistant to Mycroft Holmes, who appears in \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\", and \"[[The Empty Hearse]]\". She picks the name at random when John asks what he should call her.\n\n===Janine Hawkins===\n'''Janine Hawkins''' ([[Yasmine Akram]]) is Mary Morstan's bridesmaid in \"[[The Sign of Three]]\". She is the personal assistant of Magnussen, the villain of ''[[His Last Vow]]'', in which it is revealed that both Mary and Sherlock independently befriended her in order to get access to him. Sherlock went so far as to enter a relationship with her. He had kept her at arm's length the entire time, not wanting her to be involved too much; he even pretended that he worked night shifts, so he couldn't engage in any sexual encounters with her. Pretending to propose to her, Sherlock succeeds in getting into Magnussen's penthouse; however, Mary had rendered Janine unconscious moments before.\n\nDuring their final encounter, Janine admits that she has made a lot of money since then by going on talk shows about her relationship with the famous detective, and had bought herself a nice cottage in Sussex. It is unclear whether that was her original intention or improvised for revenge. Most of the stories that she publicized were made-up to sell better. Sherlock and Janine agree that this makes them even, and she leaves amicably, although she insists that he should not have lied to her.\n\nJanine also appears in a cameo in \"[[The Abominable Bride]]\", as a member of the sororital conspiracy Sherlock discovers.\n\n=== Mr. and Mrs. Holmes ===\n'''Mr. and Mrs. Holmes''' ([[Timothy Carlton]] and [[Wanda Ventham]], the real-life parents of Benedict Cumberbatch), Sherlock, Mycroft, and Eurus' parents, appear in Series Three and Four. They are introduced in [[The Empty Hearse]] when John comes into the flat at Baker Street to find an older couple seated in the sitting room, speaking to Sherlock. He assumes that this couple are clients, but Sherlock's conversation with them eventually implies that they know one another. After they leave, Sherlock explains to John that they are in fact his parents. John is hurt when he discovers that the reason that Mr. and Mrs. Holmes did not attend Sherlock's funeral was because Sherlock had told them, unlike John, that he was alive.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Holmes are shown to be patient and accepting parents to their highly intelligent but socially impaired sons. As the two of them chat with Sherlock during the scene in which they are first introduced, neither parent appears too surprised when Sherlock abruptly steps up onto the coffee table, using it as a step so he can climb onto the couch to work on a complex chart he is using to help him with an ongoing case. As he stands between them, working on this visual aid, his mother simply looks up at him and continues talking as if she does not even notice his unusual behavior. His father sighs and looks a bit annoyed, but remains polite.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Holmes also appear later in Series Three, in \"[[His Last Vow]]\". They are featured when John and Mary join the Holmes brothers at their parents' house for a somewhat awkward Christmas dinner before John and Sherlock travel to Appledore to seek out Magnussen's incriminating materials on Mary. Despite her great love for her boys, Mrs.&nbsp;Holmes is shown apparently not to fully understand, or not fully care about Mycroft's role in international security; when he complains that she has gotten potatoes on his laptop, \"on which depends the security of the free world,\" she simply tells him that he \"shouldn't leave it lying around if it's so important.\" It is from their mother, though, that the Holmes brothers get their great intellect; that Christmas, Mrs. Holmes is shown to have written a mathematical book on [[Fluid mechanics#mathematical fluid mechanics|fluid mechanics]]. Mr.&nbsp;Holmes, though not a genius, seems almost to fill a John-like role as, as Mary Watson puts it, the \"sane one.\" Both the Holmes parents seem to immediately love and accept Mary, who may represent something of a daughter-in-law to them, as neither of their own sons seem likely to marry or have children.\n\n===Lady Smallwood {{anchor|Lady Alicia Smallwood}} ===\n'''Lady Alicia Smallwood''' ([[Lindsay Duncan]]) is a member of the [[Cabinet Office]] and a colleague of Mycroft Holmes. She first appears in \"[[His Last Vow]]\" (although under the first name of Elizabeth), where she leads an inquiry onto the activities of media magnate Charles Augustus Magnussen, though he eventually blackmailed her into ceasing the investigation via her husband's sexual letters to an underage girl. She consults Sherlock into retrieving the letters from Magnussen, leading to Sherlock shooting him, when he discovers that Magnussen's knowledge of the letters (in addition to all his other blackmail material) were in his mind palace. Following Magnussen's death, she authorizes the punishment of Sherlock to be flown to a certain-death mission in Eastern Europe. When Moriarty reappears on every television in the country, she authorizes Sherlock's return to England to deal with Moriarty.\n\nLady Smallwood reappears in \"[[The Six Thatchers]]\", in a meeting with Sherlock, Mycroft, her secretary Vivian Norbury, and Sir Edwin. In the meeting, she reveals that footage of him executing Magnussen has been digitally altered to make a police [[sniper]] appear to be the shooter instead, effectively letting him \"off the hook\", rather than officially pardoning him. She reappears later in the episode when she is brought into questioning by Mycroft following the connection between her codename, \"Love\", and the codename, \"Amo\" (the Latin word for \"love\") used in a rescue operation in the British Embassy in [[Tbilisi]] which resulted in the British [[ambassador]] and several private military contractors (led by Mary Watson) being massacred. She is later proven innocent, when it is revealed that her secretary, Vivian Norbury (who had been [[espionage|selling secrets]]), was behind the mission sabotage.\n\nSmallwood later appears in \"[[The Lying Detective]]\", when she and Mycroft are tracking Sherlock when he is leaving his flat under the influence of drugs.

Furthermore, it was a long and bulky weapon. Its length and malfunctions became such pervasive issues that during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], some soldiers armed themselves with an [[Uzi]] [[submachine gun]] with an extended barrel.<ref name=\"SADJ\">[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1927 Galil Ace 5.56] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018114404/http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1927 |date=2013-10-18 }} \u2013 SAdefensejournal.com, 29 May 2013</ref><ref name=\"history1\">[http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=23 IMI Galil ARM/SAR] \u2013 Militaryfactory.com</ref>\n\n[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Militant in Possession of Explosives and Multiple Guns.jpg|thumb|left|Comparison of the Hungarian [[AMD-65]] (top), the American [[M16A1 rifle|M16A1]] (middle) and the Israeli Galil ARM (bottom)]]\n\nDuring the Six-Day War, the Israelis captured thousands of [[AK-47]] assault rifles and evaluated them.  The rifle proved far more reliable and controllable than the FAL, and the required maintenance was low enough that the conscripted troops would not require more stringent regulations of the weapon's care. Because of this, the IDF began the process of procuring a new automatic rifle that would offer the same benefits of low-maintenance as the AK-47 but with the accuracy of the M16 and FAL. The weapon was referred to as the Balashnikov. Several weapons were submitted for the lucrative deal of becoming the Israeli Army's standard-issue assault rifle; America offered the [[M16 rifle|M16A1]] and [[Stoner 63]] series and Germany offered the [[HK33]]. The AK-47 design was also considered, but difficulty in procurement limited its viability.\n\nHowever, an indigenous design was offered by [[Uziel Gal]], creator of the [[Uzi submachine gun]], but was ultimately found too complex and unreliable for adoption.<ref name=\"history1\" /> Another indigenous design was offered by [[Yisrael Galil]]. This rifle was based on the [[7.62\u00d739mm]] [[Valmet Rk 62]]. \"In fact, the first Galils were manufactured using Valmet Rk 62 receivers.\"<ref name=\"americanrifleman.org\"/> Galil's rifle was chambered for the American [[5.56\u00d745mm]] round, originally the US M193 55-grain version. At the time, the United States was replacing France as Israel's main partner and weapons supplier. Tests conducted from the end of the 1960s to the early 1970s led to Galili's rifle emerging as the winner. However, issuing of the Galil was delayed by the sudden onset of the Yom Kippur War in 1973.<ref name=\"SADJ\" /><ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\">[http://www.dnmsport.com/GALIL/historygalil.htm Galil Rifle History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512000952/http://www.dnmsport.com/GALIL/historygalil.htm |date=2013-05-12 }} \u2013 Dnmsport.com</ref>\n\nThe Israeli army used the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] caliber Galil in three basic configurations. The '''A'''utomatic '''R'''ifle '''M'''achine-gun '''''(ARM)''''' with a bi-pod, wire-cutter and carrying handle would become the standard service rifle issued to front line infantry troops. This is the version that famously features a bottle opener in the front handguard.<ref name=\"Sweeney\"/> The '''A'''utomatic '''R'''ifle '''''(AR)''''' without the bi-pod, wire-cutter and carrying handle was issued to support troops and military police units. The '''S'''hort '''A'''utomatic '''R'''ifle '''''(SAR)''''' with a shortened barrel was issued to vehicle crews, army staff and specialty troops.\n\nAlthough the Galil was the official service rifle of Israel from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, it was never the principal rifle used in terms of numbers. Around 1975, 60,000 M16A1s from the U.S. Military Aid Program (MAP) began to arrive for Israel, which were quickly integrated into IDF service.  As the cost of producing the Galil for all IDI forces was very expensive, Israel continued to purchase M16s and later M4s with military credit from the US, replacing many Galils then in service. In general, Israeli troops preferred the M16, because it was lighter and more accurate, if not quite as rugged and reliable. When the M4 came along this weapon with its short length and light weight became even more attractive, along with the M4's versatility in using different optics without losing zero when the weapon was disassembled, plus other rail-mounted accessories.  The M16 and M4 also proved to be better suited to the grenade launching role using the US M203 integrated 40&nbsp;mm launcher.  Israeli paratroops in particular preferred the M4 carbine to the Galil, while the M16 was retained for training recruits, reservists, Artillery Corps, and the Armored Corps (Heil HaShiryon).<ref>Rappoport, Elie, ''Micro Tavor vs. the M4/M16: Core Of The IDF\", Draft IDF, 28 December 2017, retrieved 11 March 2018</ref>\n\nBy 2000, both the Galil ARM and AR variants were phased out from standard issue and replaced by M4 and M16 variants. The Galil SAR (''G'lilon'') was kept in use by some rear-line services, including the [[Knesset Guard]]<ref name=\"SADJ\" /> and the Armored Corps, until 2005.\n\nFor a short time, the Galil was licensed by NWM (Nederlandsche Wapen-en Munitiefabriek) De Kruithoorn N.V. for sales to a NATO country.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070928075105/http://collectie.legermuseum.nl/sites/strategion/contents/i004532/arma38%20kalasjnikov.pdf</ref>\n\n==Design details==\n===Operating mechanism===\nThe Galil series of rifles are [[selective fire]] weapons operated by a [[Mikhail Kalashnikov|Kalashnikov]]-pattern [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-driven]] piston system with no regulator. The weapon is locked with a [[rotating bolt|rotary bolt]] with two locking lugs that lock into recesses milled into the receiver.\n\nWhen fired, a portion of the propellant gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a {{convert|1.8|mm|abbr=on|2}} port, drilled at a 30\u00b0 angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the [[Chrome plating|chrome-plated]] piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the bolt carrier on the right side of the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the [[pistol grip]].\n\nThe ejection of spent cases from the Galil is sometimes a violent action.  Cases can be dented by the ejector and be thrown as much as 40&nbsp;ft away from the rifle in some cases, depending on position.<ref name=\"history2\" />\n\n===Features===\n[[File:Estonian soldier DA-SD-06-03436 c1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|An [[Estonia]]n soldier on patrol in March 2005, during the [[Iraq War]], with a compact Galil SAR in 5.56\u00d745mm.]]\n\nThe Galil is hammer-fired and has a trigger mechanism patterned after the trigger used in the American [[M1 Garand]].<ref name=\"Kokalis\">{{Cite book |last=Kokalis |first=Peter |title=Weapons Tests And Evaluations: The Best Of Soldier Of Fortune |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=Paladin Press |year=2001 |page=253 |isbn=1-58160-122-0 }}</ref> The rifle's fire selector switch has three positions: S-A-R. The standard AK-47 style selector is retained on the right face of the receiver, and a dual thumb-selector is present on the left face above the pistol grip for easier manipulation.<ref name=\"MF\">http://modernfirearms.net/en/assault-rifles/israel-assault-rifles/galil-eng/</ref> Pushing the left-selector to the rear position \"R\" (British terminology for \"repetition\"), provides semi-automatic fire. Pushing it to the middle position \"A\" produces fully automatic fire. Pushing the lever fully forward to \"S\" will activate the safety. Some models use a reverse-linkage RAS mechanism that performs the opposite action; pushing forward sets the rifle to Repetition or Automatic, and pulling rearward engages the safety,\n\nThe Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted [[sheet metal]] steel receiver, but due to the higher operating pressures of the 5.56\u00d745mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy [[Milling machine|milled]] [[forging]]. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using [[Valmet]] [[Rk 62]] receivers manufactured in Finland.<ref name=\"Kokalis\" /> All exterior metal surfaces are [[Parkerizing|phosphated]] for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block and front sight tower). The machined solid steel billet action avoided cracking problems the AK-series had with steel stamped sheet actions, but this made the Galil heavier.<ref name=\"SADJ\" />\n\nThe Gas-Block, handguard retainers and folding-stock mechanism components are cast pieces that are finish-machined and accordingly fitted. The sighting arrangements are also entirely cast and machined for greater durability. The only stamped components on the Galil are the magazine-catch, trigger guard, dust cover (on the R5 and R6 the rear handguard-retainer is stamped versus cast) and the magazines.\n\nThe weapon is fitted with a high-impact plastic handguard and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular steel skeleton [[Stock (firearm)|stock]]. The rifle can be used with a sound [[suppressor]]. The weapon features a bottle opener in the front handguard and wire cutter built into the bipod.<ref name=\"Sweeney\"/> The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with [[Uzi]] submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.\n\n===Barrel===\nEarly production models were supplied with barrels that had six right-hand grooves and a 305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling twist (optimized for use with M193 ammunition), while recent production models feature a 178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) twist barrel with six right-hand grooves (used to stabilize the heavier SS109/M855 projectile). The barrel has a slotted [[flash suppressor]] with 6 ports and can be used to launch [[rifle grenade]]s (such as the [[BT/AT 52]]) or mount a [[bayonet]] lug attachment (it will accept the [[M7 bayonet]]).<ref name=\"Kokalis\" />\n\n===Feeding===\nThe Galil is fed from a curved, [[steel]] [[Magazine (firearms)|box magazine]] with a 35-round capacity (SAR and AR versions), a 50-round capacity (ARM model) or a special color-coded 12-round magazine blocked for use exclusively with [[ballistite]] (blank) cartridges, used to launch rifle grenades. The magazine is inserted front end first in a similar manner to the AK family. An optional magazine adaptor enables the use of M16 type [[STANAG magazine]]s.<ref name=\"Kokalis\" /><ref name=\"MF\"/> Some who have used the Galil ARM with the 50-round magazine have noted that it is difficult to engage targets at elevated heights while firing on the ground in the prone position due to the magazine's extended length.<ref name=\"history2\" />\n\n===Sights===\nThe L-shaped rear sight has two apertures preset for firing at 0\u2013300&nbsp;m and 300\u2013500&nbsp;m respectively (the rear sight can only be adjusted for elevation). The front post is fully adjustable for both windage and elevation zero and is enclosed in a protective hood. Low-light flip-up front blade and rear sight elements have three self-luminous [[tritium]] capsules (betalights) which are calibrated for 100&nbsp;m when deployed. When the rear night sight is flipped up for use, the rear aperture sights must be placed in an offset position intermediate between the two apertures. Certain variants have a receiver-mounted dovetail adapter that is used to mount various optical sights.\n\n===Stock===\nThe standard stock found on the Galil is a rough-copy of the FN-FAL Paratrooper stock, with modifications for simpler production and ease of use. Unlike the FAL folding stock, the Galil uses no locking button and is operated entirely by a pin and spring pivoting mechanism; to fold the stock, the \"L\" bracket on the stock portion is pressed down to where the spring is fully compressed and the entire stock is allowed to pivot on the buttstock hinge. The same operation is done for unfolding to the stock to the open-position.\n\nThe bracket and knuckle assemblies feature camming surfaces that allow the emergency unfolding of the stock by simply pulling the buttstock rearwards, however this should generally be avoided as it will wear down the mechanism rapidly over time, and lead to the stock wobbling in both positions.\n\nThere were six different types of Galil folding stock (not including the Micro or Galatz models) that were utilized over time on the Galil and R4 series of weapons. Wooden AK47 type buttstocks were also offered by request, although none are known to have been used by any militaries and were mostly relegated to the civilian market.\n\nContrary to popular belief, all Galil folding stocks are made of tubular aluminum like its FAL rendition; steel was never used, as it would have added too much additional weight, and the aluminum stocks were more than durable for standard firing and rifle-grenade usage.\n\n==Variants==\n\n===AR===\n[[File:Imfdb galil.jpg|thumb|Galil AR]]\nThe standard rifle version which is fitted with a high-impact plastic handguard and pistol grip, a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular metal skeleton [[Stock (firearm)|stock]] as fitted to all variants except the Galil Sniper. The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a {{convert|460|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel, while the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a {{convert|535|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel.\n\n===SAR===\n[[File:DA-ST-96-01245.JPEG|thumb|right|A [[Nepal]]ese peacekeeper with the 7.62mm Galil SAR.]]\nThe SAR carbine variant (aka: '''G'lilon'''), is configured with a shorter barrel. Due to the shorter barrel a corresponding shorter piston and gas tube as well as a unique gas block are found on the SAR. The SAR variant saw the longest service life in the IDF, being in use with the Armored Corps until 2005. The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a {{convert|332|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel. While the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a {{convert|400|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel.\n\n===ARM===\n[[File:IMI-Galil.jpg|thumb|5.56mm Galil ARM with bi-pod deployed]]\nThe ARM light machine gun variant is additionally equipped with a carrying handle, folding bipod and a larger wooden handguard. The wooden handguard remains cooler during sustained automatic fire and has grooves for bipod storage. When folded, the bipod's legs form a speed chute for rapid magazine insertion; the bipod will form a wire cutter and the rear handguard ferrule, which retains the bipod legs, can be used to open bottles by design, in order to prevent soldiers using magazine lips for this purpose (which damaged them).<ref name=\"Kokalis\" /> The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a {{convert|460|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel, while the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a {{convert|535|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel.\n\n===MAR===\n[[File:Elements of the Force Intervention Brigade of MONUSCO give a demonstration of their know-how in combat. The Brigade is mandated by the UN Security Council to neutralize all armed groups in eastern D.R. Congo. (9494347599).jpg|thumb|UN peacekeeper in Africa armed with a Galil MAR]]\nThe most recent addition to the Galil family of weapons is the MAR compact carbine, which retains the internal features of the original Galil with a completely new frame, operating system and an even shorter barrel. Introduced to the public at the 2nd International Defence Industry Exhibition in Poland in 1994, the weapon was developed for use with the army and police special units, vehicle crews, army staff, special operations personnel and airborne infantry.\n\nThe MAR, or the '''Micro Galil''', is a reduced-size version of the Galil SAR (706&nbsp;mm stock extended / 465&nbsp;mm folded), weighing 2.98&nbsp;kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel (210&nbsp;mm), receiver, piston, gas tube and foregrip. The firearm is fed from a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has the same rate of fire (630-750 rounds/min) as other 5.56mm Galil models. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round [[M16 rifle|M16]] magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located on both sides of the receiver) has four settings: \"S\"\u2014weapon is safe, \"A\"\u2014automatic fire, \"B\"\u20143-round burst, \"R\"\u2014semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding tubular aluminum stock and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0\u2013300&nbsp;m and beyond 300&nbsp;m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a receiver cover adapter), low-light sights with [[tritium]] illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with a bolt catch, plastic magazines weighing 0.164&nbsp;kg or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.\n\nThe MAR has undergone several changes over time, and it is worth noting that it may also be found with a polymer-coated aluminum stock or an all-polymer stock. The Model 699 is available with a 267&nbsp;mm barrel and optional left-side charging handle which is welded onto the left side of the bolt carrier and protrudes through a slot cut in the receiver cover that is covered by a spring-loaded cover while the bolt carrier is forward.\n\n===Galil Sniper===\n[[File:Galil-Sniper-Galatz-r001.jpg|thumb|IWI Galil Sniper (Galatz) semi-automatic sniper rifle.]]\nThe 7.62mm '''Galil Sniper''' (aka: ''Galil Tzalafim'' or \"''Galatz''\") is a derivative of the ARM that is used in conjunction with high-quality [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] ammunition for consistent accuracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valmet.org/galilsniper.htm|title=Galil 7.62mm semi-automatic sniper rifle|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe precision rifle is a semi-automatic-only rifle with a similar operating system to other Galil variants, but optimised for accuracy. The rifle is fed from a 25-round box magazine. It uses a heavy-profile match barrel that is heavier than that used on other variants. It is fitted with a multi-functional muzzle device, which acts as both a [[flash suppressor]] and a [[muzzle brake]]. It can be replaced with a [[sound suppressor]], which requires the use of subsonic ammunition for maximum effectiveness.\n\nThe weapon was modified with a two-stage trigger mechanism with an adjustable pull force, a wooden buttstock that folds to the right side of the weapon and a heavy-duty [[bipod]], mounted to the forward base of the receiver housing that folds beneath the handguard when not in use. The buttstock is fully adjustable in length and height and features a variable-height cheek riser. The rifle comes with mechanical [[iron sight]]s and an adapter used to mount a telescopic day sight (Nimrod 6\u00d740) or a night sight.

Two models were fielded: the \"Aleph\" individual weapon and the \"Bet\" [[squad automatic weapon]]. The FAL first saw major combat with the Israelis during the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967.  Although Israel won decisive victories, the FAL showed its limitations in IDF service; a common complaint was that the sand and dusty conditions caused the weapon's malfunction, but this was later attributed to the lack of maintenance given by IDF conscripts. Furthermore, it was a long and bulky weapon. Its length and malfunctions became such pervasive issues that during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], some soldiers armed themselves with an [[Uzi]] [[submachine gun]] with an extended barrel.<ref name=\"SADJ\">[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1927 Galil Ace 5.56] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018114404/http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1927 |date=2013-10-18 }} \u2013 SAdefensejournal.com, 29 May 2013</ref><ref name=\"history1\">[http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=23 IMI Galil ARM/SAR] \u2013 Militaryfactory.com</ref>\n\n[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Militant in Possession of Explosives and Multiple Guns.jpg|thumb|left|Comparison of the Hungarian [[AMD-65]] (top), the American [[M16A1 rifle|M16A1]] (middle) and the Israeli Galil ARM (bottom)]]\n\nDuring the Six-Day War, the Israelis captured thousands of [[AK-47]] assault rifles and evaluated them.  The rifle proved far more reliable and controllable than the FAL, and the required maintenance was low enough that the conscripted troops would not require more stringent regulations of the weapon's care. Because of this, the IDF began the process of procuring a new automatic rifle that would offer the same benefits of low-maintenance as the AK-47 but with the accuracy of the M16 and FAL. The weapon was referred to as the Balashnikov. Several weapons were submitted for the lucrative deal of becoming the Israeli Army's standard-issue assault rifle; America offered the [[M16 rifle|M16A1]] and [[Stoner 63]] series and Germany offered the [[HK33]]. The AK-47 design was also considered, but difficulty in procurement limited its viability.\n\nHowever, an indigenous design was offered by [[Uziel Gal]], creator of the [[Uzi submachine gun]], but was ultimately found too complex and unreliable for adoption.<ref name=\"history1\" /> Another indigenous design was offered by [[Yisrael Galil]]. This rifle was based on the [[7.62\u00d739mm]] [[Valmet Rk 62]]. \"In fact, the first Galils were manufactured using Valmet Rk 62 receivers.\"<ref name=\"americanrifleman.org\"/> Galil's rifle was chambered for the American [[5.56\u00d745mm]] round, originally the US M193 55-grain version. At the time, the United States was replacing France as Israel's main partner and weapons supplier. Tests conducted from the end of the 1960s to the early 1970s led to Galili's rifle emerging as the winner. However, issuing of the Galil was delayed by the sudden onset of the Yom Kippur War in 1973.<ref name=\"SADJ\" /><ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\">[http://www.dnmsport.com/GALIL/historygalil.htm Galil Rifle History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512000952/http://www.dnmsport.com/GALIL/historygalil.htm |date=2013-05-12 }} \u2013 Dnmsport.com</ref>\n\nThe Israeli army used the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] caliber Galil in three basic configurations. The '''A'''utomatic '''R'''ifle '''M'''achine-gun '''''(ARM)''''' with a bi-pod, wire-cutter and carrying handle would become the standard service rifle issued to front line infantry troops. This is the version that famously features a bottle opener in the front handguard.<ref name=\"Sweeney\"/> The '''A'''utomatic '''R'''ifle '''''(AR)''''' without the bi-pod, wire-cutter and carrying handle was issued to support troops and military police units. The '''S'''hort '''A'''utomatic '''R'''ifle '''''(SAR)''''' with a shortened barrel was issued to vehicle crews, army staff and specialty troops.\n\nAlthough the Galil was the official service rifle of Israel from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, it was never the principal rifle used in terms of numbers. Around 1975, 60,000 M16A1s from the U.S. Military Aid Program (MAP) began to arrive for Israel, which were quickly integrated into IDF service.  As the cost of producing the Galil for all IDI forces was very expensive, Israel continued to purchase M16s and later M4s with military credit from the US, replacing many Galils then in service. In general, Israeli troops preferred the M16, because it was lighter and more accurate, if not quite as rugged and reliable. When the M4 came along this weapon with its short length and light weight became even more attractive, along with the M4's versatility in using different optics without losing zero when the weapon was disassembled, plus other rail-mounted accessories.  The M16 and M4 also proved to be better suited to the grenade launching role using the US M203 integrated 40&nbsp;mm launcher.  Israeli paratroops in particular preferred the M4 carbine to the Galil, while the M16 was retained for training recruits, reservists, Artillery Corps, and the Armored Corps (Heil HaShiryon).<ref>Rappoport, Elie, ''Micro Tavor vs. the M4/M16: Core Of The IDF\", Draft IDF, 28 December 2017, retrieved 11 March 2018</ref>\n\nBy 2000, both the Galil ARM and AR variants were phased out from standard issue and replaced by M4 and M16 variants. The Galil SAR (''G'lilon'') was kept in use by some rear-line services, including the [[Knesset Guard]]<ref name=\"SADJ\" /> and the Armored Corps, until 2005.\n\nFor a short time, the Galil was licensed by NWM (Nederlandsche Wapen-en Munitiefabriek) De Kruithoorn N.V. for sales to a NATO country.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070928075105/http://collectie.legermuseum.nl/sites/strategion/contents/i004532/arma38%20kalasjnikov.pdf</ref>\n\n==Design details==\n===Operating mechanism===\nThe Galil series of rifles are [[selective fire]] weapons operated by a [[Mikhail Kalashnikov|Kalashnikov]]-pattern [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-driven]] piston system with no regulator. The weapon is locked with a [[rotating bolt|rotary bolt]] with two locking lugs that lock into recesses milled into the receiver.\n\nWhen fired, a portion of the propellant gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a {{convert|1.8|mm|abbr=on|2}} port, drilled at a 30\u00b0 angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the [[Chrome plating|chrome-plated]] piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the bolt carrier on the right side of the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the [[pistol grip]].\n\nThe ejection of spent cases from the Galil is sometimes a violent action.  Cases can be dented by the ejector and be thrown as much as 40&nbsp;ft away from the rifle in some cases, depending on position.<ref name=\"history2\" />\n\n===Features===\n[[File:Estonian soldier DA-SD-06-03436 c1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|An [[Estonia]]n soldier on patrol in March 2005, during the [[Iraq War]], with a compact Galil SAR in 5.56\u00d745mm.]]\n\nThe Galil is hammer-fired and has a trigger mechanism patterned after the trigger used in the American [[M1 Garand]].<ref name=\"Kokalis\">{{Cite book |last=Kokalis |first=Peter |title=Weapons Tests And Evaluations: The Best Of Soldier Of Fortune |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=Paladin Press |year=2001 |page=253 |isbn=1-58160-122-0 }}</ref> The rifle's fire selector switch has three positions: S-A-R. The standard AK-47 style selector is retained on the right face of the receiver, and a dual thumb-selector is present on the left face above the pistol grip for easier manipulation.<ref name=\"MF\">http://modernfirearms.net/en/assault-rifles/israel-assault-rifles/galil-eng/</ref> Pushing the left-selector to the rear position \"R\" (British terminology for \"repetition\"), provides semi-automatic fire. Pushing it to the middle position \"A\" produces fully automatic fire. Pushing the lever fully forward to \"S\" will activate the safety. Some models use a reverse-linkage RAS mechanism that performs the opposite action; pushing forward sets the rifle to Repetition or Automatic, and pulling rearward engages the safety,\n\nThe Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted [[sheet metal]] steel receiver, but due to the higher operating pressures of the 5.56\u00d745mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy [[Milling machine|milled]] [[forging]]. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using [[Valmet]] [[Rk 62]] receivers manufactured in Finland.<ref name=\"Kokalis\" /> All exterior metal surfaces are [[Parkerizing|phosphated]] for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block and front sight tower). The machined solid steel billet action avoided cracking problems the AK-series had with steel stamped sheet actions, but this made the Galil heavier.<ref name=\"SADJ\" />\n\nThe Gas-Block, handguard retainers and folding-stock mechanism components are cast pieces that are finish-machined and accordingly fitted. The sighting arrangements are also entirely cast and machined for greater durability. The only stamped components on the Galil are the magazine-catch, trigger guard, dust cover (on the R5 and R6 the rear handguard-retainer is stamped versus cast) and the magazines.\n\nThe weapon is fitted with a high-impact plastic handguard and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular steel skeleton [[Stock (firearm)|stock]]. The rifle can be used with a sound [[suppressor]]. The weapon features a bottle opener in the front handguard and wire cutter built into the bipod.<ref name=\"Sweeney\"/> The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with [[Uzi]] submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.\n\n===Barrel===\nEarly production models were supplied with barrels that had six right-hand grooves and a 305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling twist (optimized for use with M193 ammunition), while recent production models feature a 178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) twist barrel with six right-hand grooves (used to stabilize the heavier SS109/M855 projectile). The barrel has a slotted [[flash suppressor]] with 6 ports and can be used to launch [[rifle grenade]]s (such as the [[BT/AT 52]]) or mount a [[bayonet]] lug attachment (it will accept the [[M7 bayonet]]).<ref name=\"Kokalis\" />\n\n===Feeding===\nThe Galil is fed from a curved, [[steel]] [[Magazine (firearms)|box magazine]] with a 35-round capacity (SAR and AR versions), a 50-round capacity (ARM model) or a special color-coded 12-round magazine blocked for use exclusively with [[ballistite]] (blank) cartridges, used to launch rifle grenades. The magazine is inserted front end first in a similar manner to the AK family. An optional magazine adaptor enables the use of M16 type [[STANAG magazine]]s.<ref name=\"Kokalis\" /><ref name=\"MF\"/> Some who have used the Galil ARM with the 50-round magazine have noted that it is difficult to engage targets at elevated heights while firing on the ground in the prone position due to the magazine's extended length.<ref name=\"history2\" />\n\n===Sights===\nThe L-shaped rear sight has two apertures preset for firing at 0\u2013300&nbsp;m and 300\u2013500&nbsp;m respectively (the rear sight can only be adjusted for elevation). The front post is fully adjustable for both windage and elevation zero and is enclosed in a protective hood. Low-light flip-up front blade and rear sight elements have three self-luminous [[tritium]] capsules (betalights) which are calibrated for 100&nbsp;m when deployed. When the rear night sight is flipped up for use, the rear aperture sights must be placed in an offset position intermediate between the two apertures. Certain variants have a receiver-mounted dovetail adapter that is used to mount various optical sights.\n\n===Stock===\nThe standard stock found on the Galil is a rough-copy of the FN-FAL Paratrooper stock, with modifications for simpler production and ease of use. Unlike the FAL folding stock, the Galil uses no locking button and is operated entirely by a pin and spring pivoting mechanism; to fold the stock, the \"L\" bracket on the stock portion is pressed down to where the spring is fully compressed and the entire stock is allowed to pivot on the buttstock hinge. The same operation is done for unfolding to the stock to the open-position.\n\nThe bracket and knuckle assemblies feature camming surfaces that allow the emergency unfolding of the stock by simply pulling the buttstock rearwards, however this should generally be avoided as it will wear down the mechanism rapidly over time, and lead to the stock wobbling in both positions.\n\nThere were six different types of Galil folding stock (not including the Micro or Galatz models) that were utilized over time on the Galil and R4 series of weapons. Wooden AK47 type buttstocks were also offered by request, although none are known to have been used by any militaries and were mostly relegated to the civilian market.\n\nContrary to popular belief, all Galil folding stocks are made of tubular aluminum like its FAL rendition; steel was never used, as it would have added too much additional weight, and the aluminum stocks were more than durable for standard firing and rifle-grenade usage.\n\n==Variants==\n\n===AR===\n[[File:Imfdb galil.jpg|thumb|Galil AR]]\nThe standard rifle version which is fitted with a high-impact plastic handguard and pistol grip, a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular metal skeleton [[Stock (firearm)|stock]] as fitted to all variants except the Galil Sniper. The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a {{convert|460|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel, while the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a {{convert|535|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel.\n\n===SAR===\n[[File:DA-ST-96-01245.JPEG|thumb|right|A [[Nepal]]ese peacekeeper with the 7.62mm Galil SAR.]]\nThe SAR carbine variant (aka: '''G'lilon'''), is configured with a shorter barrel. Due to the shorter barrel a corresponding shorter piston and gas tube as well as a unique gas block are found on the SAR. The SAR variant saw the longest service life in the IDF, being in use with the Armored Corps until 2005. The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a {{convert|332|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel. While the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a {{convert|400|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel.\n\n===ARM===\n[[File:IMI-Galil.jpg|thumb|5.56mm Galil ARM with bi-pod deployed]]\nThe ARM light machine gun variant is additionally equipped with a carrying handle, folding bipod and a larger wooden handguard. The wooden handguard remains cooler during sustained automatic fire and has grooves for bipod storage. When folded, the bipod's legs form a speed chute for rapid magazine insertion; the bipod will form a wire cutter and the rear handguard ferrule, which retains the bipod legs, can be used to open bottles by design, in order to prevent soldiers using magazine lips for this purpose (which damaged them).<ref name=\"Kokalis\" /> The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a {{convert|460|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel, while the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a {{convert|535|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel.\n\n===MAR===\n[[File:Elements of the Force Intervention Brigade of MONUSCO give a demonstration of their know-how in combat. The Brigade is mandated by the UN Security Council to neutralize all armed groups in eastern D.R. Congo. (9494347599).jpg|thumb|UN peacekeeper in Africa armed with a Galil MAR]]\nThe most recent addition to the Galil family of weapons is the MAR compact carbine, which retains the internal features of the original Galil with a completely new frame, operating system and an even shorter barrel. Introduced to the public at the 2nd International Defence Industry Exhibition in Poland in 1994, the weapon was developed for use with the army and police special units, vehicle crews, army staff, special operations personnel and airborne infantry.\n\nThe MAR, or the '''Micro Galil''', is a reduced-size version of the Galil SAR (706&nbsp;mm stock extended / 465&nbsp;mm folded), weighing 2.98&nbsp;kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel (210&nbsp;mm), receiver, piston, gas tube and foregrip. The firearm is fed from a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has the same rate of fire (630-750 rounds/min) as other 5.56mm Galil models. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round [[M16 rifle|M16]] magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located on both sides of the receiver) has four settings: \"S\"\u2014weapon is safe, \"A\"\u2014automatic fire, \"B\"\u20143-round burst, \"R\"\u2014semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding tubular aluminum stock and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0\u2013300&nbsp;m and beyond 300&nbsp;m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a receiver cover adapter), low-light sights with [[tritium]] illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with a bolt catch, plastic magazines weighing 0.164&nbsp;kg or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.\n\nThe MAR has undergone several changes over time, and it is worth noting that it may also be found with a polymer-coated aluminum stock or an all-polymer stock. The Model 699 is available with a 267&nbsp;mm barrel and optional left-side charging handle which is welded onto the left side of the bolt carrier and protrudes through a slot cut in the receiver cover that is covered by a spring-loaded cover while the bolt carrier is forward.\n\n===Galil Sniper===\n[[File:Galil-Sniper-Galatz-r001.jpg|thumb|IWI Galil Sniper (Galatz) semi-automatic sniper rifle.]]\nThe 7.62mm '''Galil Sniper''' (aka: ''Galil Tzalafim'' or \"''Galatz''\") is a derivative of the ARM that is used in conjunction with high-quality [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] ammunition for consistent accuracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valmet.org/galilsniper.htm|title=Galil 7.62mm semi-automatic sniper rifle|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe precision rifle is a semi-automatic-only rifle with a similar operating system to other Galil variants, but optimised for accuracy. The rifle is fed from a 25-round box magazine. It uses a heavy-profile match barrel that is heavier than that used on other variants. It is fitted with a multi-functional muzzle device, which acts as both a [[flash suppressor]] and a [[muzzle brake]]. It can be replaced with a [[sound suppressor]], which requires the use of subsonic ammunition for maximum effectiveness.\n\nThe weapon was modified with a two-stage trigger mechanism with an adjustable pull force, a wooden buttstock that folds to the right side of the weapon and a heavy-duty [[bipod]], mounted to the forward base of the receiver housing that folds beneath the handguard when not in use. The buttstock is fully adjustable in length and height and features a variable-height cheek riser. The rifle comes with mechanical [[iron sight]]s and an adapter used to mount a telescopic day sight (Nimrod 6\u00d740) or a night sight. The mount is quick-detachable and capable of retaining zero after remounting. The precision rifle is stored in a rugged transport case that comes with an optical sight, mount, filters, two slings (for carrying and firing) and a cleaning kit. Recent production models feature synthetic plastic furniture and a skeletonized metal stock.\n\nThe Galatz was first introduced in 1983.<ref>[http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=605 IMI Galil Sniper (Galatz)] \u2013 Militaryfactory.com</ref> The '''SR-99''' is a modernized version of the Galatz featuring an adjustable skeleton stock instead of a wooden stock, synthetic handguard, and a synthetic pistol grip.

It uses the same 15- and 30-round magazines as the M1 Carbine, as well as a dedicated 27-round magazine incorporating a bolt hold-open device.  First issued in 1999, the MAGAL was withdrawn from service in 2001 after numerous complaints of malfunctions.\n* '''Marksman Assault Rifle Mark 1''': 5.56mm [[designated marksman rifle]] introduced in 1996.

The Galil ACE made its first public appearance on Sept 15, 2013 in the hands of the new unit PMOP (Military Police of Public Order).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* {{flag|India}}:<ref name=\"jones2009\" /> 200 Galil Sniper bought in 2002<ref name ='SAS 2003 112'>{{cite book|url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/publications/by-type/yearbook/small-arms-survey-2003.html|chapter-url= http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2003/en/Small-Arms-Survey-2003-Chapter-03-EN.pdf|chapter=Red Flags and Buicks: Global Firearms Stockpiles|title=Small Arms Survey 2003: Development Denied|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2003|author=[[Small Arms Survey]]|page=112}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Indonesia}}: ''[[Kopaska|Komando Pasukan Katak]]'' (Kopaska) tactical diver group and ''[[Kopassus|Komando Pasukan Khusus]]'' (Kopassus) special forces group.<ref name=\"idnvojnik\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrvatski-vojnik.hr/hrvatski-vojnik/1612007/ind.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213152603/http://www.hrvatski-vojnik.hr/hrvatski-vojnik/1612007/ind.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-12-13 |title=Kopassus & Kopaska \u2013 Specijalne Postrojbe Republike Indonezije |language=Croatian |publisher=Hrvatski Vojnik Magazine |access-date=2010-06-12 |df= }}</ref>\n* {{flag|Israel}}: [[Israel police]] ''Mi\u0161teret Yisra'el''.\n[[File:Israel police officers.jpg|thumb|Israeli police officers armed with 5.56mm Galil MAR]]\n* {{flag|Italy}}: As of 2009, the Bernardelli Mod.377 VB-STD and the Bernardelli Mod.378 VB-SR are in the inventories of the [[Polizia di Stato|Italian National Police]], and are known to be deployed with the [[Nucleo Operativo Centrale di Sicurezza|NOCS team]].<ref>[http://www.siulproma.com/pdf/circolari/2009/Circ._Armi_in_uso_alla_Polizia_di_Stato.pdf Italian Ministry of Interior \u2013 Decree n\u00b0 559/A/1/ORG/DIP.GP/14 of March 6, 2009, concerning weapons and equipment in use with the Italian National Police \u2013 in Italian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716075641/http://www.siulproma.com/pdf/circolari/2009/Circ._Armi_in_uso_alla_Polizia_di_Stato.pdf |date=July 16, 2011 }} Retrieved on August 25, 2010.</ref>\n* {{flag|Kenya}}: Galil Sniper rifle<ref name = 'Israel Africa'/><ref name=\"NMAA\"/>\n* {{flag|Lesotho}}<ref name=\"jones2009\" />\n* {{flag|Mexico}}: ''[[Secretariat of Public Security (Mexico)|Secretar\u00eda de Seguridad P\u00fablica]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sipse.com/noticias/7645-nuevo-armamento-para-cancun.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008210824/http://www.sipse.com/noticias/7645-nuevo-armamento-para-cancun.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 October 2011|title=Nuevo armamento para SSP de Canc\u00fan|author=Grupo SIPSE|work=sipse.com|access-date=25 October 2014}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Mongolia}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shuud.mn/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/352.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207144525/http://www.shuud.mn/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/352.jpg |archive-date=2013-12-07 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECB_XX4NEzM|title=084th division.

{"title_page": "Meadowlands Sports Complex", "text_new": "[[File:Meadowlands Sports Complex aerial 1 2018.jpg|thumb|A view of the complex from the air in 2018]]\nThe '''MetLife Sports Complex''' is a [[Sports complex|sports complex]] located in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]], [[New Jersey]], United States.  The facility is owned and operated by the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]] (NJSEA).<ref>{{cite news |title=It's official: MetLife Stadium |first=John |last=Brennan |url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/128299098_It_s_official__MetLife__Stadium_.html |newspaper=The Record |location=Bergen County |date=August 23, 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThe complex currently consists of the [[MetLife Stadium]], which is home to the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]] of the [[National Football League]] and the [[New York Guardians]] of the [[XFL (2020)|XFL]]; the [[Meadowlands Racetrack]], a famous [[harness racing]] circuit (which is home of the annual [[Hambletonian Stakes]]); and the [[#Quest Diagnostics Training Center|Quest Diagnostics Training Center]], which is the Giants' practice facility.\n\nThe complex is also the home to the  [[American Dream (Shopping And Entertainment Complex)|American Dream]]  entertainment venue and the now-closed [[Meadowlands Arena]], which served as a home for the [[New Jersey Devils]] of the [[National Hockey League]], [[Seton Hall University]]'s [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|men's basketball team]], and the team the arena was built for, the now-[[Brooklyn Nets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]].\n\n==History==\nIn the mid-1960s, civic leaders in [[New Jersey]] began calling for a sports complex in the [[New Jersey Meadowlands]] that would be able to lure a [[National Football League|NFL]] team from New York City. The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority Law was passed by the [[New Jersey Legislature]] in 1971 and signed by then\u2013[[Governor of New Jersey]] [[William T. Cahill]]. The first chairman of the NJSEA was [[Sonny Werblin|David A. \"Sonny\" Werblin]], former president of the NFL's [[New York Jets]]. By year's end, Werblin had secured a deal for the [[New York Giants]], who were then playing in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in [[the Bronx]], to move to the Meadowlands. Ground was broken on [[Giants Stadium]] and the Meadowlands Racetrack on November 19, 1972.\n\nTo accommodate the new facility, access roads were improved. The [[New Jersey Turnpike]], which had been suffering the burden of increased traffic volumes near its northern terminus in [[Ridgefield Park, New Jersey|Ridgefield Park]], built a new alignment, the \"western spur\", with an exit, interchange 16W, leading directly to the sports complex as well as to [[New Jersey Route 3|Route 3]]. Routes 3 and 20 (now [[New Jersey Route 120|120]]) also received improvements.\n\nOn September 1, 1976, the Meadowlands Racetrack became the first complex venue to open, featuring [[harness racing]]. The track drew a capacity crowd of 42,133 for its initial date. Giants Stadium opened on October 10, 1976, as 76,042 fans watched the New York Giants lose to the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 24\u201314.\n\nBy 1977, plans were in the works to expand the complex. A new arena was to be built on the opposite side of Route 20 from the stadium and racetrack, connected by vehicle ramps and a pedestrian bridge. [[Brendan Byrne]] Arena, named for the sitting governor, opened July 2, 1981, with the first of six sold-out shows by musician [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The arena was renamed for its corporate sponsor, [[Continental Airlines]] (now part of [[United Airlines]]), as Continental Airlines Arena, in early 1996, since the arena had a hub at nearby [[Newark Liberty International Airport]]. It was renamed again in 2007 for [[Izod]] as Izod Center. The first tenant in the arena was the [[New Jersey Nets]] in 1981. A year later, the [[New Jersey Devils]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and the [[Seton Hall University]] men's basketball team joined the Nets.\n\nThe Nets played their first game at the arena on October 30, 1981, and lost to their cross-river rivals, the [[New York Knicks]] by a score of 103\u201399. The Devils played their first game on October 5, 1982, against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. The game ended in a 3\u20133 tie.\n\nThe [[New York Jets]] moved to Giants Stadium on September 6, 1984, after playing at [[Shea Stadium]] for nearly 20 years. In their first game at the stadium on that day, the Jets lost 23\u201317 to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in front of 70,564 fans.\n\nIn 2007, construction began on a mega-mall, named Meadowlands Xanadu. Work came to a halt in 2009, and [[Triple Five]], owners of the [[Mall of America]], took over the project in 2011. The construction was not complete until 2019. \n\nThe New Jersey Devils and Seton Hall Pirates left the complex when the [[Prudential Center]] was finished in 2007, followed by the New Jersey Nets, who moved there in 2010 to go to Prudential Center, then Brooklyn two years later, leaving the Izod Center devoid of a main tenant but free to host more concerts and events. [[Giants Stadium]] closed in at the end of the [[2009 NFL season]] and demolition started immediately. In September 2010, [[MetLife Stadium]], then known as New Meadowlands Stadium, opened for its first game. It was privately built and funded by the Jets and Giants. A commuter train line and a training center for the Giants also opened at the same time.  MetLife bought the naming rights for the stadium and the entire complex in August 2011.\n\n[[Meadowlands Arena]] closed in April 2015 to the public after suffering the loss of its major tenants and economic losses from other events.

The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority Law was passed by the [[New Jersey Legislature]] in 1971 and signed by then\u2013[[Governor of New Jersey]] [[William T. Cahill]]. The first chairman of the NJSEA was [[Sonny Werblin|David A. \"Sonny\" Werblin]], former president of the NFL's [[New York Jets]]. By year's end, Werblin had secured a deal for the [[New York Giants]], who were then playing in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in [[the Bronx]], to move to the Meadowlands. Ground was broken on [[Giants Stadium]] and the Meadowlands Racetrack on November 19, 1972.\n\nTo accommodate the new facility, access roads were improved. The [[New Jersey Turnpike]], which had been suffering the burden of increased traffic volumes near its northern terminus in [[Ridgefield Park, New Jersey|Ridgefield Park]], built a new alignment, the \"western spur\", with an exit, interchange 16W, leading directly to the sports complex as well as to [[New Jersey Route 3|Route 3]]. Routes 3 and 20 (now [[New Jersey Route 120|120]]) also received improvements.\n\nOn September 1, 1976, the Meadowlands Racetrack became the first complex venue to open, featuring [[harness racing]]. The track drew a capacity crowd of 42,133 for its initial date. Giants Stadium opened on October 10, 1976, as 76,042 fans watched the New York Giants lose to the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 24\u201314.\n\nBy 1977, plans were in the works to expand the complex. A new arena was to be built on the opposite side of Route 20 from the stadium and racetrack, connected by vehicle ramps and a pedestrian bridge. [[Brendan Byrne]] Arena, named for the sitting governor, opened July 2, 1981, with the first of six sold-out shows by musician [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The arena was renamed for its corporate sponsor, [[Continental Airlines]] (now part of [[United Airlines]]), as Continental Airlines Arena, in early 1996, since the arena had a hub at nearby [[Newark Liberty International Airport]]. It was renamed again in 2007 for [[Izod]] as Izod Center. The first tenant in the arena was the [[New Jersey Nets]] in 1981. A year later, the [[New Jersey Devils]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and the [[Seton Hall University]] men's basketball team joined the Nets.\n\nThe Nets played their first game at the arena on October 30, 1981, and lost to their cross-river rivals, the [[New York Knicks]] by a score of 103\u201399. The Devils played their first game on October 5, 1982, against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. The game ended in a 3\u20133 tie.\n\nThe [[New York Jets]] moved to Giants Stadium on September 6, 1984, after playing at [[Shea Stadium]] for nearly 20 years. In their first game at the stadium on that day, the Jets lost 23\u201317 to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in front of 70,564 fans.\n\nIn 2007, construction began on a mega-mall, named Meadowlands Xanadu. Work came to a halt in 2009, and [[Triple Five]], owners of the [[Mall of America]], took over the project in 2011. The construction was not complete until 2019. \n\nThe New Jersey Devils and Seton Hall Pirates left the complex when the [[Prudential Center]] was finished in 2007, followed by the New Jersey Nets, who moved there in 2010 to go to Prudential Center, then Brooklyn two years later, leaving the Izod Center devoid of a main tenant but free to host more concerts and events. [[Giants Stadium]] closed in at the end of the [[2009 NFL season]] and demolition started immediately. In September 2010, [[MetLife Stadium]], then known as New Meadowlands Stadium, opened for its first game. It was privately built and funded by the Jets and Giants. A commuter train line and a training center for the Giants also opened at the same time.  MetLife bought the naming rights for the stadium and the entire complex in August 2011.\n\n[[Meadowlands Arena]] closed in April 2015 to the public after suffering the loss of its major tenants and economic losses from other events. Since then, the arena has been used for concert rehearsals and private video productions. The former arena box offices are used as a station for the NJSEA EMS and the former Winner's Club lounge restaurant is the quarters for the [[New Jersey State Police]].\n\n[[File:Meadowlands Sports Secaucus jeh.jpg|thumb|From Secaucus]]\nIn addition to the three venues, the complex also hosts events in the MetLife Stadium parking lot. State Fair Meadowlands (formerly called the Meadowlands Fair, and not affiliated with the [[New Jersey State Fair]] held annually in [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]]) began in 1986 and has been operated by State Fair of [[Belleville, New Jersey|Belleville]] since 2003. The parking lot is also the home of a twice-weekly [[flea market]], which is canceled when the parking spaces are needed for stadium events.\n\nThe NJSEA hires in-house security and emergency medical services staff to serve the venues at the Sports Complex, including MetLife Stadium. Law enforcement is primarily provided by the [[New Jersey State Police]] Sports Complex Unit.\n\n==Venues==\n\n===MetLife Stadium===\n[[MetLife Stadium]] is the home stadium for the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] and until the opening of [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California]] is the only facility home to two NFL franchises. Also the home of the [[New York Guardians]] of the [[XFL (2020)|XFL]], the stadium opened in 2010, following the closing and demolition of the Giants' and the Jets' previous home, [[Giants Stadium]]. MetLife Stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] in 2014.\n\n===Meadowlands Arena (former)===\n[[Meadowlands Arena]] (formerly Brendan Byrne Arena, Continental Airlines Arena and IZOD Center) was a multi-purpose indoor arena. Opened in 1981, it was home to the [[New Jersey Nets]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] team until 2010, the [[Seton Hall University]] men's basketball team until 2007 and to the [[New Jersey Devils]] of the National Hockey League until 2007. The Devils and the Seton Hall men's basketball team moved to the [[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. The renamed Brooklyn Nets currently play in the [[Barclays Center]]. It closed early in April 2015.\n\n===Meadowlands Racetrack===\nThe [[Meadowlands Racetrack]] is a [[horse racing]] track that hosts both [[thoroughbred racing]] and [[harness racing]].

The track is equipped to race at night, when most of its races are.\n\nIn the middle of the track is a lake, intended to resemble the state of New Jersey. The Meadowlands Racetrack is also one of the leading simulcast facilities in the world in terms of total handle.\n\n===Quest Diagnostics Training Center===\nThe Quest Diagnostics Training Center is the main headquarters and practice facility of the [[New York Giants]].

Avant signed Withers to a record deal and assigned former Stax Records stalwart [[Booker T.

His first album release with the label, ''[[Making Music (Bill Withers album)|Making Music]]'', included the single \"She's Lonely\", which was featured in the film ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar (film)|Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]'' along with \"She Wants to (Get on Down)\".

Withers stated in interviews that a lot of the songs approved for the album, in particular, two of the first three singles released, were the same songs which were rejected in 1982, hence contributing significantly to the eight-year hiatus between albums.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/> Withers also stated it was frustrating seeing his record label release an album for [[Mr. T]], an actor, when they were preventing him, an actual singer, from releasing his own. He toured with [[Jennifer Holliday]] in 1985 to promote what would be his final studio album.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/>\n\nHis disdain for Columbia's A&R executives or \"blaxperts\", as he termed them, trying to exert control over how he should sound if he wanted to sell more albums, played a part in his decision to not record or re-sign to a record label after 1985, effectively ending his performing career, even though remixes of his previously recorded music were released well after his 'retirement'.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\">{{cite magazine|last=Greene |first=Andy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/bill-withers-the-soul-man-who-walked-away-20150414 |title=Bill Withers: The Soul Man Who Walked Away |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph1\">{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/7928784/Bill-Withers-interview.html |title=Bill Withers interview |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/writing/still_bill_the_story_of_bill_withers/ |title=Still Bill: The Story of Bill Withers |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7236327 |title=Songwriter Bill Withers And A Career Cut Short |publisher=NPR |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/08/as-is-2 |title=As Is |magazine=The New Yorker |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref> Finding musical success later in life than most, at 32, he has said he was socialized as a 'regular guy' who had a life before the music, so he did not feel an inherent need to keep recording once he fell out of love with the industry.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/> He has also stated that he does not miss touring and performing live and does not regret leaving music behind.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/><ref name=\"telegraph1\"/> He seemingly no longer suffers from the [[speech impediment]] of [[stuttering]] that affected him during his recording career.<ref name=\"telegraph1\"/>\n\n===Post-Columbia career===\nIn 1988, a new version of \"Lovely Day\" from the 1977 ''Menagerie'' album, entitled \"Lovely Day (Sunshine Mix)\" and [[remix]]ed by [[Ben Liebrand]], reached the [[Top 40|Top 10]] in the United Kingdom, leading to Withers'  performance on the long-running ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' that year. The original release had reached #7 in the UK in early 1978, and the re-release climbed higher to #4.\n\nIn 1987, he received his ninth Grammy Award nomination and on March 2, 1988, his third Grammy for Best Rhythm and Blues Song as songwriter for the re-recording of \"Lean on Me\" by [[Club Nouveau]] on their debut album ''Life, Love and Pain'', released in 1986 on [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\nIn 1996, a portion of his song \"Grandma's Hands\" was sampled in the song \"[[No Diggity]]\" by [[BLACKstreet]], featuring [[Dr. Dre]]. The single went to Number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and sold 1.6&nbsp;million copies and won a Grammy in 1998 for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nWithers contributed two songs to [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s 2004 release ''[[License to Chill]]''. Following the reissues of ''Still Bill'' on January 28, 2003, and ''Just As I Am'' on March 8, 2005, there was speculation of previously unreleased material being issued as a new album.<ref>Mitchell, Gail (October 14, 2005). \"[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61070/withers-in-no-hurry-to-make-new-album Withers In No Hurry To Make New Album]\".

Palmaccio and Tom Ruff.\n\nOn April 18, 2015, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by [[Stevie Wonder]]. Withers was stunned when he learned he had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \"I see it as an award of attrition,\" he says. \"What few songs I wrote during my brief career, there ain't a genre that somebody didn't record them in.

Avant signed Withers to a record deal and assigned former Stax Records stalwart [[Booker T.

His first album release with the label, ''[[Making Music (Bill Withers album)|Making Music]]'', included the single \"She's Lonely\", which was featured in the film ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar (film)|Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]'' along with \"She Wants to (Get on Down)\".

Withers stated in interviews that a lot of the songs approved for the album, in particular, two of the first three singles released, were the same songs which were rejected in 1982, hence contributing significantly to the eight-year hiatus between albums.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/> Withers also stated it was frustrating seeing his record label release an album for [[Mr. T]], an actor, when they were preventing him, an actual singer, from releasing his own. He toured with [[Jennifer Holliday]] in 1985 to promote what would be his final studio album.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/>\n\nHis disdain for Columbia's A&R executives or \"blaxperts\", as he termed them, trying to exert control over how he should sound if he wanted to sell more albums, played a part in his decision to not record or re-sign to a record label after 1985, effectively ending his performing career, even though remixes of his previously recorded music were released well after his 'retirement'.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\">{{cite magazine|last=Greene |first=Andy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/bill-withers-the-soul-man-who-walked-away-20150414 |title=Bill Withers: The Soul Man Who Walked Away |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph1\">{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/7928784/Bill-Withers-interview.html |title=Bill Withers interview |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/writing/still_bill_the_story_of_bill_withers/ |title=Still Bill: The Story of Bill Withers |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7236327 |title=Songwriter Bill Withers And A Career Cut Short |publisher=NPR |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/08/as-is-2 |title=As Is |magazine=The New Yorker |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref> Finding musical success later in life than most, at 32, he has said he was socialized as a 'regular guy' who had a life before the music, so he did not feel an inherent need to keep recording once he fell out of love with the industry.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/> He has also stated that he does not miss touring and performing live and does not regret leaving music behind.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/><ref name=\"telegraph1\"/> He seemingly no longer suffers from the [[speech impediment]] of [[stuttering]] that affected him during his recording career.<ref name=\"telegraph1\"/>\n\n===Post-Columbia career===\nIn 1988, a new version of \"Lovely Day\" from the 1977 ''Menagerie'' album, entitled \"Lovely Day (Sunshine Mix)\" and [[remix]]ed by [[Ben Liebrand]], reached the [[Top 40|Top 10]] in the United Kingdom, leading to Withers'  performance on the long-running ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' that year. The original release had reached #7 in the UK in early 1978, and the re-release climbed higher to #4.\n\nIn 1987, he received his ninth Grammy Award nomination and on March 2, 1988, his third Grammy for Best Rhythm and Blues Song as songwriter for the re-recording of \"Lean on Me\" by [[Club Nouveau]] on their debut album ''Life, Love and Pain'', released in 1986 on [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\nIn 1996, a portion of his song \"Grandma's Hands\" was sampled in the song \"[[No Diggity]]\" by [[BLACKstreet]], featuring [[Dr. Dre]]. The single went to Number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and sold 1.6&nbsp;million copies and won a Grammy in 1998 for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nWithers contributed two songs to [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s 2004 release ''[[License to Chill]]''. Following the reissues of ''Still Bill'' on January 28, 2003, and ''Just As I Am'' on March 8, 2005, there was speculation of previously unreleased material being issued as a new album.<ref>Mitchell, Gail (October 14, 2005). \"[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61070/withers-in-no-hurry-to-make-new-album Withers In No Hurry To Make New Album]\".

Palmaccio and Tom Ruff.\n\nOn April 18, 2015, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by [[Stevie Wonder]]. Withers was stunned when he learned he had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \"I see it as an award of attrition,\" he says. \"What few songs I wrote during my brief career, there ain't a genre that somebody didn't record them in. I'm not a virtuoso, but I was able to write songs that people could identify with.
