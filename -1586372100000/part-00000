[https://books.google.com/books?id=z7xLh00p9yAC&pg=PA40 ''The First Crash: Lessons from the South Sea Bubble'']. London: Princeton University Press, 2004. p. 40.</ref> was a British [[joint-stock company]] founded in 1711, created as a [[public-private partnership]] to [[Debt consolidation|consolidate]] and reduce the cost of the [[national debt]]. To assist in the generation of income for this purpose, the company was granted a monopoly to trade with the islands in the \"[[South Seas]]\" and [[South America]]. When the company was created, Britain was involved in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and Spain and Portugal controlled most of South America. There was thus no realistic prospect that trade would take place, and as it turned out, the Company never realised any significant profit from its monopoly. However, Company stock rose greatly in value as it expanded its operations dealing in government debt, and peaked in 1720 before suddenly collapsing to little above its original [[flotation (shares)|flotation]] price. The notorious [[economic bubble]] thus created, which ruined thousands of investors, became known as the '''South Sea Bubble'''.\n\nThe [[Bubble Act]] 1720 ([[6 Geo I]], c 18), which forbade the creation of joint-stock companies without [[royal charter]], was promoted by the South Sea Company itself before its collapse.\n\nIn Great Britain, many investors were ruined by the share-price collapse, and as a result, the national economy reduced substantially. The founders of the scheme engaged in [[insider trading]], by using their advance knowledge of the timings of national debt consolidations to make large profits from purchasing debt in advance. Huge bribes were given to politicians to support the [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] necessary for the scheme.<ref>Dorothy Marshall, (1962) ''Eighteenth Century England'' pp 121-30.</ref> Company money was used to deal in its own shares, and selected individuals purchasing shares were given cash loans backed by those same shares to spend on purchasing more shares. The expectation of profits from trade with South America was talked-up to encourage the public to purchase shares, but the bubble prices reached far beyond what the actual profits of the business (namely the slave trade) could justify.<ref>Helen Paul, (2013) ''The South Sea Bubble: An Economic History of its Origins and Consequences'' ch 4.</ref>\n\nA [[parliamentary inquiry]] was held after the bursting of the bubble to discover its causes. A number of politicians were disgraced, and people found to have profited immorally from the company had personal assets confiscated proportionate to their gains (most had already been rich and remained so). Finally, the Company was restructured and continued to operate for more than a century after the Bubble. The headquarters were in [[Threadneedle Street]], at the centre of the [[City of London]], the financial district of the capital. At the time of these events, the [[Bank of England]] was also a private company dealing in national debt, and the crash of its rival confirmed its position as banker to the British government.<ref>Walter Thornbury. 'Threadneedle Street',  [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol1/pp531-544 Old and New London: Volume 1 (London, 1878), pp. 531-544]   via British History Online (accessed 21 July 2016).</ref>\n\n== Foundation ==\nWhen in August 1710 [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]] was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the government had already become reliant on the [[Bank of England]], a privately owned company chartered 16 years previously, which had obtained a monopoly as the lender to Westminster,{{clarify|Dec 2019. Westminster?? meaning what?|date=December 2019}} in return for arranging and managing loans to the government. The government had become dissatisfied with the service it was receiving and Harley was actively seeking new ways to improve the national finances.\n\nA new Parliament met in November 1710 resolved to attend to national finances, which were suffering significantly from the pressures of [[List of wars involving Great Britain|two simultaneous wars]]: the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] with France, which ended in 1713, and the [[Great Northern War]], which was not to end until 1721. Harley came prepared, with detailed accounts describing the situation of the national debt, which was customarily a piecemeal arrangement, with each government department borrowing independently as the need arose. He released the information steadily, continually adding new reports of debts incurred and scandalous expenditure, until in January 1711 the House of Commons agreed to appoint a committee to investigate the entire debt. The committee included Harley himself, the two [[Auditor of the Imprests|Auditors of the Imprests]] (whose task was to investigate government spending), [[Edward Harley (1664\u20131735)|Edward Harley]] (the Chancellor's brother), Paul Foley (the Chancellor's brother-in-law), the [[Secretary to the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[William Lowndes (British politician)|William Lowndes]] (who had had significant responsibility for reminting the entire debased British coinage in 1696) and [[John Aislabie]] (who represented the [[October Club]], a group of about 200 MPs who had agreed to vote together).<ref>Carswell p.40, 48-50</ref>\n\nHarley's first concern was to find \u00a3300,000 for the next quarter's payroll for the British army operating on the Continent under the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]]. This funding was provided by a private consortium of [[Edward Gibbon#Early life: 1737\u20131752|Edward Gibbon]],<ref>grandfather of [[Edward Gibbon|the historian]]</ref> [[George Caswall]] and [[C. Hoare & Co|Hoare's Bank]]. The Bank of England had been operating a [[state lottery]] on behalf of the government, but in 1710 this had produced less revenue than expected and another had already begun in 1711, which was also performing poorly; Harley granted the authority to sell tickets to [[Sir John Blunt, 1st Baronet|John Blunt]], a director of the [[Hollow Sword Blade Company]], which despite its name was an unofficial bank. Sales commenced on 3 March 1711 and  tickets had completely sold out by the 7th, making it the first truly successful English state lottery.<ref>Carswell p. 50-51</ref>\n\nThe success was shortly followed by another larger lottery, \"The Two Million Adventure\" or \"The Classis\", with tickets costing \u00a3100, with a top prize of \u00a320,000 and every ticket winning a prize of at least \u00a310. Although prizes were advertised by their total value, they were in fact paid-out by instalments in the form of a fixed annuity over a period of years, so that the government effectively held the prize money as borrowings until the whole value had been paid out to the winners. Marketing was handled by members of the Sword Blade syndicate, Gibbon selling \u00a3200,000 of tickets and earning \u00a34,500 commission, and Blunt selling \u00a3993,000. Charles Blunt (a relative) was made Paymaster of the lottery with expenses of \u00a35,000.\n\n=== Conception of the Company ===\nThe national debt investigation concluded that a total of \u00a39 million was owed by the government, with no specifically allocated income to pay it off. Edward Harley and John Blunt had jointly devised a scheme to consolidate this debt in much the same way that the Bank of England had consolidated previous debts, although the Bank still held the monopoly for operating as a bank. All holders of the debt (creditors) would be required to surrender it to a new company formed for the purpose, the South Sea Company, which in return would issue them shares in itself to the same nominal value. The government would make an annual payment to the Company of \u00a3568,279, equating to 6% interest plus expenses, which would then be re-distributed to the shareholders as a dividend. The company was also granted a monopoly to trade with South America, a potentially lucrative enterprise, but one controlled by Spain, with whom Britain was at war.<ref name=\"auto2\">Carswell p.52-54</ref>\n\nAt that time, when the continent of America was being explored and colonized, Europeans applied the term \"South Seas\" only to South America and surrounding waters. The concession both held out the potential for future profits and encouraged a desire for an end to the war, necessary if any profits were to be made. The original suggestion for the South Sea scheme came from [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]], one of the founders of the Bank of England and of the financially disastrous [[Darien Scheme]].<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nHarley was rewarded for delivering the scheme by being created Earl of Oxford on 23 May 1711 and was promoted to [[Lord High Treasurer]]. With a more secure position, he began secret peace negotiations with France. \n\n===Initial speculation===\nThe scheme to thus consolidate all government debt and to manage it better in the future held out the prospect of all existing creditors being repaid the full nominal value of their loans, which at the time before the scheme was publicised were valued at a discounted rate of \u00a355 per \u00a3100 nominal value, as the lotteries were discredited and the government's ability to repay in full was widely doubted. Thus bonds representing the debt intended to be consolidated under the scheme were available for purchase on the open market at a price which  allowed anyone with advance knowledge to buy and resell in the immediate future at a high profit, for as soon as the scheme became publicised the bonds would once again be worth at least their nominal value, as repayment was now more certain a prospect. This anticipation of gain made it possible for Harley to bring further financial supporters into the scheme, such as James Bateman and [[Sir Theodore Janssen, 1st Baronet|Theodore Janssen]].<ref>Carswell p.54-55</ref>\n\n[[Daniel Defoe]] commented:<ref>Defoe, Daniel, ''An Essay on the South-Sea Trade'' ... , 2nd ed., (London, England:  J. Baker, 1712), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NZ5VAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA40#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 40-41.]</ref><br/>\n:''Unless the Spaniards are to be divested of common sense, infatuate, and given up, abandoning their own commerce, throwing away the only valuable stake they have left in the world, and in short, bent on their own ruin, we cannot suggest that they will ever, on any consideration, or for any equivalent, part with so valuable, indeed so inestimable a jewel, as the exclusive trade to their own plantations''.<br/>\n\nThe originators of the scheme knew that there was no money to invest in a trading venture, and no realistic expectation that there would ever be a trade to exploit, but nevertheless the potential for great wealth was widely publicised at every opportunity, so as to encourage interest in the scheme. The objective for the founders was to create a company which they could use to become wealthy and which offered  scope for further government deals.<ref>Carswell p. 56</ref>\n\n=== Flotation ===\n[[File:Bubble.folly.jpg|thumb|right|The \"night singer of shares\" sold stock on the streets during the South Sea Bubble (Amsterdam, 1720)]]\nThe [[royal charter]] for the company, based on that of the Bank of England, was drawn up by Blunt who was paid \u00a33,846 for his services in setting up the company. Directors would be elected every three years and shareholders would meet twice a year. The Company employed a Cashier, Secretary and Accountant. The Governor was intended as an honorary position, and was later customarily held by the monarch. The charter allowed the full court of directors to nominate a smaller committee to act on any matter on its behalf. Directors of the Bank of England and of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] were disbarred from being a director of the South Sea Company. Any ship of more than 500 tons owned by the Company was to have a Church of England clergyman on board.\n\nThe surrender of government debt for Company stock was to occur in five separate lots. The first two of these, totaling \u00a32.75 million from about 200 large investors, had already been arranged before the company's charter was issued on 10 September 1711. The government itself surrendered \u00a30.75 million of its own debt held by different departments (at that time individual office holders were at liberty to invest government funds under their control to their own advantage before it was required for government expenditure). Harley surrendered \u00a38,000 of debt and was appointed Governor of the new company. Blunt, Caswall and Sawbridge together surrendered \u00a365,000, Janssen \u00a325,000 of his own plus \u00a3250,000 from a foreign consortium, Decker \u00a349,000, Sir Ambrose Crawley \u00a336,791. The company had a Sub-Governor, Bateman; a Deputy Governor, Ongley; and 30 ordinary directors. In total, nine of the directors were politicians, five were members of the Sword Blade consortium, and seven more were financial magnates who had been attracted to the scheme.<ref>Carswell p.57,58</ref>\n\nThe company created a coat of arms with the motto ''A Gadibus usque ad Auroram'' (\"from Cadiz to the dawn\", from [[Juvenal]], [[Satires (Juvenal)|Satires]], 10) and rented a large house in the City of London as its headquarters. Seven sub-committees were created to handle its everyday business, the most important being the \"committee for the affairs of the company\". The Sword Blade company was retained as the Company's banker and on the strength of its new government connections issued notes in its own right, notwithstanding the Bank of England's monopoly. The task of the Company Secretary was to oversee trading activities; the Accountant, Grigsby, was responsible for registering and issuing stock; and the Cashier, Robert Knight, acted as Blunt's personal assistant at a salary of \u00a3200 per annum.<ref>Carswell p.60-63</ref>\n\n=== The slave trade ===\nThe [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 granted Britain an ''[[Asiento]]'' lasting 30 years to supply the Spanish colonies with 4,800 slaves per year. Britain was permitted to open offices in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Caracas]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Havana]], [[Panama]], [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]] and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] to arrange the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. One ship of no more than 500 tons could be sent to one of these places each year (the ''Nav\u00edo de Permiso'') with general trade goods. One quarter of the profits were to be reserved for the King of Spain. There was provision for two extra sailings at the start of the contract. The Asiento was granted in the name of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and then contracted to the company.<ref>Carswell p. 64-66</ref>\n\nBy July the company had arranged contracts with the [[Royal African Company]] to supply the necessary African slaves to Jamaica. Ten pounds was paid for a slave aged over 16, \u00a38 for one under 16 but over 10. Two-thirds were to be male, and 90% adult. The company trans-shipped 1,230 slaves from Jamaica to America in the first year, plus any that might have been added (against standing instructions) by the ship's captains on their own behalf. On arrival of the first cargoes, the local authorities refused to accept the Asiento, which had still not been officially confirmed there by the Spanish authorities. The slaves were eventually sold at a loss in the West Indies.<ref>Carswell p. 65-66</ref>\n\nIn 1714 the government announced that a quarter of profits would be reserved for the Queen and a further 7.5% for a financial advisor, Manasseh Gilligan. Some Company board members refused to accept the contract on these terms, and the government was obliged to reverse its decision.<ref>Carswell p. 67</ref>\n\nDespite these setbacks, the company continued, having raised \u00a3200,000 to finance the operations. In 1714 2,680 slaves were carried, and for 1716\u201317, 13,000 more, but the trade continued to be unprofitable. An import duty of 33 [[Spanish dollar|pieces of eight]] was charged on each slave (although for this purpose some slaves might be counted only as a fraction of a slave, depending on quality). One of the extra trade ships was sent to Cartagena in 1714 carrying woollen goods, despite warnings that there was no market for them there, and they remained unsold for two years.<ref>Carswell p. 66-67</ref>\n\n=== Changes of management ===\nThe company was heavily dependent on the goodwill of government; when the government changed, so too did the company board. In 1714 one of the directors who had been sponsored by Harley, Arthur Moore, had attempted to send 60 tons of private goods on board the company ship. He was dismissed as a director, but the result was the beginning of Harley's fall from favour with the company. On 27 July 1714, Harley was replaced as Lord High Treasurer as a result of a disagreement that had broken out within the Tory faction in parliament. Queen Anne died on 1 August 1714; and at the election of directors in 1715 the Prince of Wales (the future King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]) was elected as Governor of the Company. The new King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and the Prince of Wales both had significant holdings in the company, as did some prominent Whig politicians, including [[James Craggs the Elder]], the Earl of Halifax and Sir Joseph Jekyll. James Craggs, as Postmaster General, was responsible for intercepting mail on behalf of the government to obtain political and financial information. All Tory politicians were removed from the board and replaced with businessmen. The Whigs Horatio Townshend, brother in law of [[Robert Walpole]], and the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] were elected directors.\n\nThe new government led to a revival of the company's share value, which had fallen below its issue price. The previous government had failed to make the interest payments to the company for the last two years, owing more than \u00a31 million. The new administration insisted the debt be written off, but allowed the company to issue new shares to stockholders to the value of the missed payments. At around \u00a310 million, this now represented half the share capital issued in the entire country. In 1714 the company had 2,000 to 3,000 shareholders, more than either of its rivals.<ref>Carswell p.67-70</ref>\n\nBy the time of the next directors' elections in 1718 politics had changed again, with a schism within the Whigs between Walpole's faction supporting the Prince of Wales and [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]]'s supporting the King. Argyll and Townshend were dismissed as directors, as were surviving Tories Sir Richard Hoare and George Pitt, and King George I became governor. Four MPs remained directors, as did six people holding government financial offices. The Sword Blade Company remained bankers to the South Sea, and indeed had flourished despite the company's dubious legal position. Blunt and Sawbridge remained South Sea directors, and they had been joined by Gibbon and Child. Caswall had retired as a South Sea director to concentrate on the Sword Blade business. In November 1718 Sub-Governor Bateman and Deputy Governor Shepheard both died. Leaving aside the honorary position of Governor, this left the company suddenly without its two most senior and experienced directors. They were replaced by Sir John Fellowes as Sub-Governor and Charles Joye as Deputy.<ref>Carswell p.73-75</ref>\n\n=== War ===\nIn 1718 war broke out with Spain once again, in the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]]. The company's assets in South America were seized, which the company claimed cost it \u00a3300,000. Any prospect of profit from trade, for which the company had purchased ships and had been planning its next ventures, disappeared.<ref>Carswell p.75-76</ref>\n\n== Refinancing government debt ==\nEvents in France now came to influence the future of the company. A Scottish economist and financier, [[John Law (economist)|John Law]], exiled after killing a man in a duel, had travelled around Europe before settling in France. There he founded a bank, which in December 1718 became the Banque Royale, national bank of France, while Law himself was granted sweeping powers to control the economy of France, which operated largely by royal decree. Law's remarkable success was known in financial circles throughout Europe, and now came to inspire Blunt and his associates to make greater efforts to grow their own concerns.<ref>Carswell p.88-89</ref>\n\nIn February 1719 Craggs explained to the House of Commons a new scheme for improving the national debt by converting the annuities issued after the 1710 lottery into South Sea stock. By Act of Parliament, the company was granted the right to issue \u00a31,150 of new stock for every \u00a3100 per annum of annuity which was surrendered. The government would pay 5% per annum on the stock created, which would halve their annual bill. The conversion was voluntary, amounting to \u00a32.5 million new stock if all converted. The company was to make an additional new loan to the government pro-rata up to \u00a3750,000, again at 5%.<ref>Carswell p.89-90</ref>\n\nThe South Sea company presented the offer to the public in July 1719. In March there was an abortive attempt to restore the Old Pretender, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Edward Stuart]], to the throne of Britain, with a small landing of troops in Scotland. They were defeated at the [[Battle of Glen Shiel]] on 10 June. The Sword Blade company spread a rumour that the Pretender had been captured, and the general euphoria encouraged the South Sea share price to rise from \u00a3100, where it had been in the spring, to \u00a3114. Annuitants were still paid out at the same money value of shares, the company keeping the profit from the rise in value before issuing. About two-thirds of the in-force annuities were exchanged.\n\n=== Trading more debt for equity ===\n[[File:William Hogarth - The South Sea Scheme.png|thumb|right|350px|[[William Hogarth]], ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'' (1721). In the bottom left corner are Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish figures gambling, while in the middle there is a huge machine, like a merry-go-round, which people are boarding. At the top is a goat, written below which is \"Who'l Ride\". The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder, while the progress of the well-dressed people towards the ride in the middle represents the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the South Sea Company, which spent more time issuing stock than anything else.]]\n\nThe 1719 scheme was a distinct success from the government's perspective, and they sought to repeat it. Negotiations took place between Aislabie and Craggs for the government and Blunt, Cashier Knight and his assistant and Caswell. Janssen, the Sub Governor and Deputy Governor were also consulted but negotiations remained secret from most of the company. News from France was of fortunes being made investing in Law's bank, whose shares had risen sharply. Money was moving around Europe, and other flotations threatened to soak up available capital (two insurance schemes in December 1719 each sought to raise \u00a33 million).<ref>Carswell p.100-102</ref>\n\nPlans were made for a new scheme to take over most of the unconsolidated national debt of Britain (\u00a330,981,712) in exchange for company shares. Annuities were valued as a lump sum necessary to produce the annual income over the original term at an assumed interest of 5%, which favoured those with shorter terms still to run. The government agreed to pay the same amount to the company for all the fixed term repayable debt as it had been paying before, but after seven years the 5% interest rate would fall to 4% on both the new annuity debt and also that taken over previously. After the first year, the company was to give the government \u00a33 million in four quarterly installments. New stock would be created at a face value equal to the debt, but the share price was still rising and sales of the remaining stock, i.e. the excess of the total market value of the stock over the amount of the debt, would be used to raise the government fee plus a profit for the company. The more the price rose in advance of conversion, the more the company would make. Before the scheme, payments were costing the government \u00a31.5 million per year.<ref name=\"auto\">Carswell p.102-107</ref>\n\nIn summary, the total government debt in 1719 was \u00a350 million:\n\n* \u00a318.3m was held by three large corporations:\n** \u00a33.4m by the [[Bank of England]]\n** \u00a33.2m by the [[British East India Company]]\n** \u00a311.7m by the South Sea Company\n* Privately held redeemable debt amounted to \u00a316.5m\n* \u00a315m consisted of irredeemable annuities, long-fixed-term annuities of 72\u201387 years, and short annuities of 22 years remaining to expiry.\n\nThe purpose of this conversion was similar to the old one: debt holders and annuitants might receive less return in total, but an illiquid investment was transformed into shares which could be readily traded. Shares backed by national debt were considered a safe investment and a convenient way to hold and move money: far easier and safer than metal coins. The only alternative safe asset, land, was much harder to sell and it was legally much more complex to transfer ownership.\n\nThe government received a cash payment and lower overall interest on the debt. Importantly, it also gained control over when the debt had to be repaid, which was not before seven years but then at its discretion. This avoided the risk that debt might become repayable at some future point just when the government needed to borrow more, and could be forced into paying higher interest rates. The payment to the government was to be used to buy in any debt not subscribed to the scheme, which although it helped the government also helped the company by removing possibly competing securities from the market, including large holdings by the Bank of England.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nCompany stock was now trading at \u00a3123, so the issue amounted to an injection of \u00a35 million of new money into a booming economy just as interest rates were falling. [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) for Britain at this point was estimated as \u00a364.4 million.[http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/budget_pie_ukgs.php?span=ukgs302&year=1717&view=1&expand=&units=b&fy=2010&state=UK#ukgs302]\n\n==== Public announcement ====\nOn 21 January the plan was presented to the board of the South Sea Company, and on 22 January [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[John Aislabie]] presented it to Parliament. The House was stunned into silence, but on recovering proposed that the Bank of England should be invited to make a better offer. In response, the South Sea increased its cash payment to \u00a33.5 million, while the Bank proposed to undertake the conversion with a payment of \u00a35.5 million and a fixed conversion price of \u00a3170 per \u00a3100 face value Bank stock. On 1 February, the company negotiators led by Blunt raised their offer to \u00a34 million plus a proportion of \u00a33.5 million depending on how much of the debt was converted. They also agreed that the interest rate would reduce after four years instead of seven, and agreed to sell on behalf of the government \u00a31 million of Exchequer bills (formerly handled by the Bank). The House accepted the South Sea offer. Bank stock fell sharply.<ref>Carswell p.112-113</ref>\n\nPerhaps the first sign of difficulty came when the South Sea Company announced that its Christmas 1719 dividend would be deferred for 12 months. The company now embarked on a show of gratitude to its friends. Select individuals were sold a parcel of company stock at the current price. The transactions were recorded by Knight in the names of intermediaries, but no payments were received and no stock issued \u2013 indeed the company had none to issue until the conversion of debt began. The individual received an option to sell his stock back to the company at any future date at whatever market price might then apply. Shares went to the Craggs: [[James Craggs the Elder|the Elder]] and [[James Craggs the Younger|the Younger]]; [[John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower|Lord Gower]]; [[George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]; and four other MPs. [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] would gain \u00a3500 for every pound that stock rose; George I's mistress, their children and Countess Platen \u00a3120 per pound rise, Aislabie \u00a3200 per pound, [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] \u00a3600 per pound. Others invested money, including the [[Richard Hampden (1674\u20131728)|Treasurer to the Navy, Hampden]], who invested \u00a325,000 of government money on his own behalf.<ref>Carswell p.114-118</ref>\n\nThe proposal was accepted in a slightly altered form in April 1720. Crucial in this conversion was the proportion of holders of irredeemable annuities who could be tempted to convert their securities at a high price for the new shares. (Holders of redeemable debt had effectively no other choice but to subscribe.) The South Sea Company could set the conversion price but could not diverge much from the market price of its shares. The company ultimately acquired 85% of the redeemables and 80% of the irredeemables.\n\n=== Inflating the share price ===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ssbprice.jpg|thumb|The South Sea share]] -->\n[[File:South-sea-bubble-chart.png|thumb|right|Chart of company stock prices.]]\nThe company then set to talking up its stock with \"the most extravagant rumours\" of the value of its potential trade in the New World; this was followed by a wave of \"speculating frenzy\". The share price had risen from the time the scheme was proposed: from \u00a3128 in January 1720, to \u00a3175 in February, \u00a3330 in March and, following the scheme's acceptance, \u00a3550 at the end of May.\n\nWhat may have supported the company's high multiples (its [[P/E ratio]]) was a fund of credit (known to the market) of \u00a370 million available for commercial expansion which had been made available through substantial support, apparently, by Parliament and the King.\n\nShares in the company were \"sold\" to politicians at the current market price; however, rather than paying for the shares, these recipients simply held on to what shares they had been offered, with the option of selling them back to the company when and as they chose, receiving as \"profit\" the increase in market price. This method, while winning over the heads of government, the King's mistress, et al., also had the advantage of binding their interests to the interests of the Company: in order to secure their own profits, they had to help drive up the stock. Meanwhile, by publicising the names of their elite stockholders, the Company managed to clothe itself in an aura of legitimacy, which attracted and kept other buyers.\n\n=== Bubble Act ===\n{{Main|Bubble Act}}\nThe South Sea Company was by no means the only company seeking to raise money from investors in 1720. A large number of other joint-stock companies had been created making extravagant (sometimes fraudulent) claims about foreign or other ventures or bizarre schemes. Others represented potentially sound, although novel, schemes, such as for founding insurance companies. These were nicknamed \"Bubbles\". Some of the companies had no legal basis, while others, such as the Hollow Sword Blade company acting as the South Sea's banker, used existing chartered companies for purposes entirely different from their creation. The York Buildings Company was set up to provide water to London, but was purchased by Case Billingsley who used it to purchase confiscated Jacobite estates in Scotland, which then formed the assets of an insurance company.<ref name=\"auto1\">Carswell p.116-117</ref>\n\nOn 22 February 1720 John Hungerford raised the question of bubble companies in the House of Commons, and persuaded the House to set up a committee, which he chaired, to investigate. He identified a number of companies which between them sought to raise \u00a340 million in capital. The committee investigated the companies, establishing a principle that companies should not be operating outside the objects specified in their charters. A potential embarrassment for the South Sea was avoided when the question of the Hollow Sword Blade Company arose. Difficulty was avoided by flooding the committee with MPs who were supporters of the South Sea, and voting down the proposal to investigate the Hollow Sword by 75 to 25. (At this time, committees of the House were either 'Open' or 'secret'. A secret committee was one with a fixed set of members who could vote on its proceedings. By contrast, any MP could join in with an 'open' committee and vote on its proceedings.) Stanhope, who was a member of the committee, received \u00a350,000 of the 'resaleable' South Sea stock from Sawbridge, a director of the Hollow Sword, at about this time. Hungerford had previously been expelled from the Commons for accepting a bribe.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\nAmongst the bubble companies investigated were two supported by Lords Onslow and Chetwynd respectively, for insuring shipping. These were criticised heavily, and the questionable dealings of the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General in trying to obtain charters for the companies led to both being replaced. However, the schemes had the support of [[Robert Walpole|Walpole]] and [[James Craggs the Younger|Craggs]], so that the larger part of the Bubble Act (which finally resulted in June 1720 from the committee's investigations) was devoted to creating charters for the [[Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation]] and the [[London Assurance Corporation]]. The companies were required to pay \u00a3300,000 for the privilege. The Act required that a joint stock company could only be incorporated by Act of Parliament or [[Royal charter]]. The prohibition on unauthorised joint stock ventures was not repealed until 1825.<ref>Carswell p.138-140</ref>\n\nThe passing of the Act gave a boost to the South Sea Company, its shares leaping to \u00a3890 in early June. This peak encouraged people to start to sell; to counterbalance this the company's directors ordered their agents to buy, which succeeded in propping the price up at around \u00a3750.\n\n=== Top reached ===\n[[File:South Sea Bubble Cards-Tree.png|thumb|200px|Tree caricature from Bubble Cards.]]\nThe price of the stock went up over the course of a single year from about \u00a3100 to almost \u00a31000 per share. Its success caused a country-wide frenzy\u2014[[herd behavior]]<ref>Paul, Helen Julia (2010) The South Sea Bubble: an economic history of its origins and consequences, Routledge Explorations in Economic History, Routledge, London.</ref>\u2014as all types of people, from peasants to lords, developed a feverish interest in investing: in South Seas primarily, but in stocks generally. Among the many companies to go public in 1720 is\u2014famously\u2014one that advertised itself as \"a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\".<ref>[[Charles Mackay (author)|Charles Mackay]], ''[[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]]'' (Harriman House Classics 2003), pp 53, 65, 71.</ref>\n\nThe price finally reached \u00a31,000 in early August, and the level of selling was such that the price started to fall, dropping back to \u00a3100 per share before the year was out.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Der geplatzte Traum vom schnellen Geld |language=German |first=Peter |last=Alter |authorlink=Peter Alter |magazine=[[Damals]] |year=2018 |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=72\u201376}}</ref> This triggered [[bankruptcy|bankruptcies]] amongst those who had bought on credit, and increased selling, even [[short selling]] (i.e., selling borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back at a profit if the price fell).{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nAlso, in August 1720, the first of the installment payments of the first and second money subscriptions on new issues of South Sea stock were due. Earlier in the year John Blunt had come up with an idea to prop up the share price: the company would lend people money to buy its shares. As a result, many shareholders could not pay for their shares except by selling them.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nFurthermore, a scramble for liquidity appeared internationally as \"bubbles\" were also ending in Amsterdam and Paris. The collapse coincided with the fall of the [[Mississippi Company]] of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]] in France. As a result, the price of South Sea shares began to decline.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Recriminations ===\nBy the end of September the stock had fallen to \u00a3150. Company failures now extended to [[bank]]s and [[goldsmith]]s, as they could not collect loans made on the stock, and thousands of individuals were ruined, including many members of the [[aristocracy]]. With investors outraged, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was recalled in December and an investigation began. Reporting in 1721, it revealed widespread [[fraud]] amongst the company directors and corruption in the Cabinet. Among those implicated were [[John Aislabie]] (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), [[James Craggs the Elder]] (the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]]), [[James Craggs the Younger]] (the [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]]), and even [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] (the heads of the Ministry). Craggs the Elder and Craggs the Younger both died in disgrace; the remainder were [[impeached]] for their corruption. The Commons found Aislabie guilty of the \"most notorious, dangerous and infamous corruption\", and he was imprisoned.\n\nThe newly appointed [[First Lord of the Treasury]], [[Robert Walpole]], successfully  restored public confidence in the financial system. However, public opinion, as shaped by the many prominent men who lost money, demanded revenge. Walpole supervised the process, which removed all 33 of the company directors and stripped them of, on average, 82% of their wealth. The money went to the victims and the stock of the South Sea Company was divided between the Bank of England and the East India Company. Walpole made sure that King George and his mistresses were protected, and by a margin of three votes he managed to save several key government officials from impeachment. In the process, Walpole won plaudits as the savior of the financial system while establishing himself as the dominant figure in British politics; historians credit him for rescuing the Whig government, and indeed the Hanoverian Dynasty, from total disgrace.<ref> Marshall, pp 127-30. </ref><ref>Richard A.

After [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] became the King of Spain, Britain obtained at the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] the rights to the slave trade to the Spanish Indies (or [[Asiento]]) for 30 years. Those rights were previously held by the [[Compagnie de Guin\u00e9e et de l'Assiente du Royaume de la France]].\n\nThe South Sea Company board opposed taking on the slave trade that had showed little profitability when chartered companies had engaged in it, but it was the only legal type of commerce with the Spanish Colonies as they were a closed market{{clarify|date=February 2014}}. To increase the profitability, the Asiento contract included the right to send one yearly 500 ton ship to the fairs at Portobello and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] loaded with duty-free merchandises, called the ''Nav\u00edo de Permiso''.\nThe Crown of England and the King of Spain were each entitled to 25% of the profits, according to the terms of the contract, that was a copy of the French Asiento contract, but [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] soon renounced her share. The King of Spain did not receive any payments due to him, and this was one of the sources of contention between the Spanish Crown and the South Sea Company.\n\nAs was the case for previous holders of the Asiento, the Portuguese and the French, the profit was not in the slave trade but in the illegal contraband goods smuggled in the slave ships and in the annual ship. Those goods were sold at the Spanish colonies at a handsome price as they were in high demand and constituted unfair competition with taxed goods, proving an important drain on the Spanish Crown trade income.\nThe relationship between the South Sea Company and the Government of Spain was always bad, and worsened with time. The Company complained of searches and seizures of goods, lack of profitability, and confiscation of properties during the wars between Britain and Spain of 1718\u20131723 and 1727\u20131729, during which the operations of the Company were suspended. The Government of Spain complained of the illegal trade, failure of the company to present its accounts as stipulated by the contract, and non-payment of the King's share of the profits.\nThese claims were a major cause of deteriorating relations between the two countries in 1738; and although the Prime Minister [[Robert Walpole|Walpole]] opposed war, there was strong support for it from the King, the House of Commons, and a faction in his own Cabinet. Walpole was able to negotiate a treaty with the King of Spain at the [[Convention of Pardo]] in January 1739 that stipulated that Spain would pay British merchants \u00a395,000 in compensation for captures and seized goods, while the South Sea Company would pay the Spanish Crown \u00a368,000 in due proceeds from the Asiento. The South Sea Company refused to pay those proceeds and the King of Spain retained payment of the compensation until payment from the South Sea Company could be secured. The break up of relations between the South Sea Company and the Spanish Government was a prelude to the ''[[War of Jenkins' Ear|Guerra del Asiento]]'', as the first [[Royal Navy]] fleets departed in July 1739 for the Caribbean, prior to the declaration of war, which lasted from October 1739 until 1748. This war is known as the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]].<ref>Nelson (1945) states that the substantial illicit trade pursued by the South Sea Company officials under the Asiento \u201cmust be considered as a major cause of the War of Jenkins' Ear because it threatened to destroy the entire commercial framework of the Spanish Empire&nbsp;... Unable to accept the destruction of its commercial system, Spain attempted to negotiate but requested that the company, as an evidence of good faith, should open its accounts for inspection by the Spanish representatives. Naturally, the directors refused, for compliance would have meant the complete exposure of the illegal traffic. Neither Spain nor the South Sea Company would yield. War was the inevitable result\u201d.</ref><ref>Brown (1926, p. 663) says that The failure to comply with the accounting provisions of the Asiento treaty (in the context of Spanish knowledge of secret accounts kept by the South Sea Company which would prove clandestine trading) was a constant source of the friction which culminated in armed conflict.</ref><ref>For Hildner (1938), the war of 1739 might have been averted if the issues addressed by the commission established in 1732 to settle disputes over the Asiento had been resolved.</ref>\n\n=== Slave trade under the Asiento ===\n{{Main|Asiento}}\n[[File:1713 Asiento contract.png|thumb|Cover of the English translation of the Asiento contract signed by Britain and Spain in 1713 as part of the Utrecht treaty that ended the War of Spanish Succession. The contract granted exclusive rights to Britain to sell slaves in the Spanish Indies.]]\nUnder the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], Spain was the only European power that could not establish factories in Africa to purchase slaves. The slaves for the Spanish America were provided by companies that were granted exclusive rights to their trade. This monopoly contract was called the slave [[Asiento]]. Between 1701 and 1713 the Asiento contract was granted to France. In 1711 Britain had created the South Sea Company to reduce debt and to trade with the Spanish America, but that commerce was illegal without a permit from Spain, and the only existing permit was the Asiento for the slave trade, so at the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 Britain obtained the transfer of the Asiento contract from French to British hands for the next 30 years.\nThe board of directors was reluctant to take on the slave trade that was not an object of the company and had shown little profitability when carried out by chartered companies, but they finally agreed on 26 March 1714. The Asiento set a sale quota of 4800 units of slaves per year. An adult male slave counted as one unit; females and children counted as fractions of a unit. Initially the slaves were provided by the [[Royal African Company]].\n\nThe South Sea Company established slave reception factories at [[Cartagena, Colombia]], [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]], Panama, [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]], [[La Guaira]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[La Havana]] and [[Santiago de Cuba]], and slave deposits at [[Jamaica]] and [[Barbados]]. Despite problems with speculation, the South Sea Company was relatively successful at [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trading]] and meeting its quota (it was unusual for other, similarly chartered companies to fulfill their quotas). According to records compiled by David Eltis and others, during the course of 96 voyages in 25 years, the South Sea Company purchased 34,000 slaves, of whom 30,000 survived the voyage across the Atlantic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/wm/58.1/eltis.html|title=History Cooperative \u2013 A Short History of Nearly Everything!|website=History Cooperative|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20091020132439/http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/wm/58.1/eltis.html|archivedate=2009-10-20}}</ref> (Thus about 11% of the slaves died on the voyage: a relatively low mortality rate for the [[Middle Passage|Middle Crossing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/paul.doc|title=The South Sea Company's slaving activities|first=Helen|last=Paul|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209151433/http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/paul.doc|archivedate=2012-12-09}}</ref>) The company persisted with the slave trade through two wars with Spain and the calamitous 1720 commercial [[Economic bubble|bubble]]. The company's trade in human slavery peaked during the 1725 trading year, five years after the bubble burst.<ref>Paul, H.J. (2010). ''The South Sea Bubble''.</ref> Between 1715 and 1739, slave trading constituted the main legal commercial activity of the South Sea Company.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n=== The annual ship ===\nThe slave Asiento contract of 1713 granted a permit to send one vessel of 500 tons per year, loaded with duty-free merchandise to be sold at the fairs of [[New Spain]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], and [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]]. This was an unprecedented concession that broke two centuries of strict exclusion of foreign merchants from the Spanish Empire.<ref>Walker, G. J. (1979), p. 101</ref>\n\nThe first ship to head for the Americas, the ''Royal Prince'', was scheduled for 1714 but was delayed until August 1716. In consideration of the three annual ships missed since the date of the Asiento, the permitted tonnage of the next ten ships was raised to 650.<ref>Archivo General de Indias, Seville, Spain IG2785</ref> Actually only seven annual ships sailed during the Asiento, the last one being the Royal Caroline in 1732. The company's failure to produce accounts for all the annual ships but the first one, and lack of payment of the proceeds to the Spanish Crown from the profits for all the annual ships, resulted in no more permits being granted to the Company's ships after the Royal Caroline trip of 1732\u20131734.\n\nIn contrast to the legitimate trade in slaves, the regular trade of the annual ships generated healthy returns, in some case profits were over 100%.<ref>McLachlan, (1940), pp. 130-131</ref> Accounts for the voyage of the ''Royal Prince'' were not presented until 1733, following continuous demands by Spanish officials. They reported that profits of \u00a343,607.<ref>Archivo General de Indias, Seville, Spain C266L3</ref> Since the King of Spain was entitled to 25% of the profits, after deducting interest on a loan he claimed \u00a38,678. The South Sea Company never paid the amount due for the first annual ship to the Spanish Crown, nor did it pay any amount for any of the other six trips.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n=== Arctic whaling ===\n<!--former section heading retained as an anchor to preserve backlinks-->\n{{Main|Whaling_in_the_United_Kingdom#The_northern_whale_fishery}}\nThe [[Greenland Company]] had been established by Act of Parliament in 1693 with the object of catching whales in the Arctic. The products of their \"whale-fishery\" were to be free of customs and other duties. Partly due to maritime disruption caused by wars with France, the Greenland Company failed financially within a few years. In 1722 Henry Elking published a proposal, directed at the governors of the South Sea Company, that they should resume the \"Greenland Trade\" and send ships to catch whales in the Arctic. He made very detailed suggestions about how the ships should be crewed and equipped.<ref>Elking, Henry [1722](1980). ''A view of the Greenland Trade and whale-fishery''. Reprinted: Whitby: Caedmon. {{ISBN|0-905355-13-X}}</ref>\n\nThe British Parliament confirmed that a British Arctic \"whale-fishery\" would continue to benefit from freedom from customs duties, and in 1724 the South Sea Company decided to commence whaling. They had 12 whale-ships built on the River Thames and these went to the Greenland seas in 1725. Further ships were built in later years, but the venture was not successful. There were hardly any experienced whalemen remaining in Britain, and the Company had to engage Dutch and Danish whalemen for the key posts aboard their ships: for instance all commanding officers and harpooners were hired from the [[North Frisia]]n island of [[F\u00f6hr]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Uwe |last=Zacchi |language=German |title=Menschen von F\u00f6hr.

By 1732 the Company had accumulated a net loss of \u00a3177,782 from their eight years of Arctic whaling.<ref>Anderson, Adam [1801](1967). ''The Origin of Commerce''. Reprinted: New York: Kelley.</ref>\n\nThe South Sea Company directors appealed to the British government for further support. Parliament had passed an Act in 1732 that extended the duty-free concessions for a further nine years. In 1733 an Act was passed that also granted a government subsidy to British Arctic whalers, the first in a long series of such Acts that continued and modified the whaling subsidies throughout the 18th century. This, and the subsequent Acts, required the whalers to meet conditions regarding the crewing and equipping of the whale-ships that closely resembled the conditions suggested by Elking in 1722.<ref>Evans, Martin H. (2005). Statutory requirements regarding surgeons on British whale-ships. ''The Mariner's Mirror'' '''91''' (1) 7-12.</ref>\nIn spite of the extended duty-free concessions, and the prospect of real subsidies as well, the Court and Directors of the South Sea Company decided that they could not expect to make profits from Arctic whaling. They sent out no more whale-ships after the loss-making 1732 season.\n\n== Government debt after the Seven Years' War ==\nThe company continued its trade (when not interrupted by war) until the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763). However, its main function was always managing government debt, rather than trading with the Spanish colonies. The South Sea Company continued its management of the part of the [[Government debt|National Debt]] until it was disestablished in 1853, at which point the debt was reconsolidated. The debt was not paid off by [[World War I]], at which point it was consolidated again, under terms that allowed the government to avoid repaying the principal.\n\n== Armorials ==\nThe armorials of the South Sea Company, according to a [[grant of arms]] dated 31 October 1711, were: ''Azure, a globe whereon are represented the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn all proper and in sinister chief point two herrings haurient in saltire argent crowned or, in a canton the united arms of Great Britain''. Crest: ''A ship of three masts in full sail''. Supporters, dexter: ''The emblematic figure of Britannia, with the shield, lance etc all proper''; sinister: ''A fisherman completely clothed, with cap boots fishing net etc and in his hand a string of fish, all proper''.<ref>National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, catalogue entry for sculpture of arms, object ID: HRA0043  [http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/605213.html]</ref>\n\n== Officers of the South Sea Company ==\nThe South Sea Company had a governor (generally an honorary position); a subgovernor; a deputy governor and 30 directors (reduced in 1753 to 21).<ref>See, for 1711\u201321, J Carswell, ''South Sea Bubble'' (1960) 274-9; and for 1721\u20131840, see British Library, Add.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=z7xLh00p9yAC&pg=PA40 ''The First Crash: Lessons from the South Sea Bubble'']. London: Princeton University Press, 2004. p. 40.</ref> was a British [[joint-stock company]] founded in 1711, created as a [[public-private partnership]] to [[Debt consolidation|consolidate]] and reduce the cost of the [[national debt]]. To assist in the generation of income for this purpose, the company was granted a monopoly to trade with the islands in the \"[[South Seas]]\" and [[South America]]. When the company was created, Britain was involved in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and Spain and Portugal controlled most of South America. There was thus no realistic prospect that trade would take place, and as it turned out, the Company never realised any significant profit from its monopoly. However, Company stock rose greatly in value as it expanded its operations dealing in government debt, and peaked in 1720 before suddenly collapsing to little above its original [[flotation (shares)|flotation]] price. The notorious [[economic bubble]] thus created, which ruined thousands of investors, became known as the '''South Sea Bubble'''.\n\nThe [[Bubble Act]] 1720 ([[6 Geo I]], c 18), which forbade the creation of joint-stock companies without [[royal charter]], was promoted by the South Sea Company itself before its collapse.\n\nIn Great Britain, many investors were ruined by the share-price collapse, and as a result, the national economy reduced substantially. The founders of the scheme engaged in [[insider trading]], by using their advance knowledge of the timings of national debt consolidations to make large profits from purchasing debt in advance. Huge bribes were given to politicians to support the [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] necessary for the scheme.<ref>Dorothy Marshall, (1962) ''Eighteenth Century England'' pp 121-30.</ref> Company money was used to deal in its own shares, and selected individuals purchasing shares were given cash loans backed by those same shares to spend on purchasing more shares. The expectation of profits from trade with South America was talked-up to encourage the public to purchase shares, but the bubble prices reached far beyond what the actual profits of the business (namely the slave trade) could justify.<ref>Helen Paul, (2013) ''The South Sea Bubble: An Economic History of its Origins and Consequences'' ch 4.</ref>\n\nA [[parliamentary inquiry]] was held after the bursting of the bubble to discover its causes. A number of politicians were disgraced, and people found to have profited immorally from the company had personal assets confiscated proportionate to their gains (most had already been rich and remained so). Finally, the Company was restructured and continued to operate for more than a century after the Bubble. The headquarters were in [[Threadneedle Street]], at the centre of the [[City of London]], the financial district of the capital. At the time of these events, the [[Bank of England]] was also a private company dealing in national debt, and the crash of its rival confirmed its position as banker to the British government.<ref>Walter Thornbury. 'Threadneedle Street',  [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol1/pp531-544 Old and New London: Volume 1 (London, 1878), pp. 531-544]   via British History Online (accessed 21 July 2016).</ref>\n\n== Foundation ==\nWhen in August 1710 [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]] was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the government had already become reliant on the [[Bank of England]], a privately owned company chartered 16 years previously, which had obtained a monopoly as the lender to Westminster,{{clarify|Dec 2019. Westminster?? meaning what?|date=December 2019}} in return for arranging and managing loans to the government. The government had become dissatisfied with the service it was receiving and Harley was actively seeking new ways to improve the national finances.\n\nA new Parliament met in November 1710 resolved to attend to national finances, which were suffering significantly from the pressures of [[List of wars involving Great Britain|two simultaneous wars]]: the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] with France, which ended in 1713, and the [[Great Northern War]], which was not to end until 1721. Harley came prepared, with detailed accounts describing the situation of the national debt, which was customarily a piecemeal arrangement, with each government department borrowing independently as the need arose. He released the information steadily, continually adding new reports of debts incurred and scandalous expenditure, until in January 1711 the House of Commons agreed to appoint a committee to investigate the entire debt. The committee included Harley himself, the two [[Auditor of the Imprests|Auditors of the Imprests]] (whose task was to investigate government spending), [[Edward Harley (1664\u20131735)|Edward Harley]] (the Chancellor's brother), Paul Foley (the Chancellor's brother-in-law), the [[Secretary to the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[William Lowndes (British politician)|William Lowndes]] (who had had significant responsibility for reminting the entire debased British coinage in 1696) and [[John Aislabie]] (who represented the [[October Club]], a group of about 200 MPs who had agreed to vote together).<ref>Carswell p.40, 48-50</ref>\n\nHarley's first concern was to find \u00a3300,000 for the next quarter's payroll for the British army operating on the Continent under the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]]. This funding was provided by a private consortium of [[Edward Gibbon#Early life: 1737\u20131752|Edward Gibbon]],<ref>grandfather of [[Edward Gibbon|the historian]]</ref> [[George Caswall]] and [[C. Hoare & Co|Hoare's Bank]]. The Bank of England had been operating a [[state lottery]] on behalf of the government, but in 1710 this had produced less revenue than expected and another had already begun in 1711, which was also performing poorly; Harley granted the authority to sell tickets to [[Sir John Blunt, 1st Baronet|John Blunt]], a director of the [[Hollow Sword Blade Company]], which despite its name was an unofficial bank. Sales commenced on 3 March 1711 and  tickets had completely sold out by the 7th, making it the first truly successful English state lottery.<ref>Carswell p. 50-51</ref>\n\nThe success was shortly followed by another larger lottery, \"The Two Million Adventure\" or \"The Classis\", with tickets costing \u00a3100, with a top prize of \u00a320,000 and every ticket winning a prize of at least \u00a310. Although prizes were advertised by their total value, they were in fact paid-out by instalments in the form of a fixed annuity over a period of years, so that the government effectively held the prize money as borrowings until the whole value had been paid out to the winners. Marketing was handled by members of the Sword Blade syndicate, Gibbon selling \u00a3200,000 of tickets and earning \u00a34,500 commission, and Blunt selling \u00a3993,000. Charles Blunt (a relative) was made Paymaster of the lottery with expenses of \u00a35,000.\n\n=== Conception of the Company ===\nThe national debt investigation concluded that a total of \u00a39 million was owed by the government, with no specifically allocated income to pay it off. Edward Harley and John Blunt had jointly devised a scheme to consolidate this debt in much the same way that the Bank of England had consolidated previous debts, although the Bank still held the monopoly for operating as a bank. All holders of the debt (creditors) would be required to surrender it to a new company formed for the purpose, the South Sea Company, which in return would issue them shares in itself to the same nominal value. The government would make an annual payment to the Company of \u00a3568,279, equating to 6% interest plus expenses, which would then be re-distributed to the shareholders as a dividend. The company was also granted a monopoly to trade with South America, a potentially lucrative enterprise, but one controlled by Spain, with whom Britain was at war.<ref name=\"auto2\">Carswell p.52-54</ref>\n\nAt that time, when the continent of America was being explored and colonized, Europeans applied the term \"South Seas\" only to South America and surrounding waters. The concession both held out the potential for future profits and encouraged a desire for an end to the war, necessary if any profits were to be made. The original suggestion for the South Sea scheme came from [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]], one of the founders of the Bank of England and of the financially disastrous [[Darien Scheme]].<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nHarley was rewarded for delivering the scheme by being created Earl of Oxford on 23 May 1711 and was promoted to [[Lord High Treasurer]]. With a more secure position, he began secret peace negotiations with France. \n\n===Initial speculation===\nThe scheme to thus consolidate all government debt and to manage it better in the future held out the prospect of all existing creditors being repaid the full nominal value of their loans, which at the time before the scheme was publicised were valued at a discounted rate of \u00a355 per \u00a3100 nominal value, as the lotteries were discredited and the government's ability to repay in full was widely doubted. Thus bonds representing the debt intended to be consolidated under the scheme were available for purchase on the open market at a price which  allowed anyone with advance knowledge to buy and resell in the immediate future at a high profit, for as soon as the scheme became publicised the bonds would once again be worth at least their nominal value, as repayment was now more certain a prospect. This anticipation of gain made it possible for Harley to bring further financial supporters into the scheme, such as James Bateman and [[Sir Theodore Janssen, 1st Baronet|Theodore Janssen]].<ref>Carswell p.54-55</ref>\n\n[[Daniel Defoe]] commented:<ref>Defoe, Daniel, ''An Essay on the South-Sea Trade'' ... , 2nd ed., (London, England:  J. Baker, 1712), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NZ5VAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA40#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 40-41.]</ref><br/>\n:''Unless the Spaniards are to be divested of common sense, infatuate, and given up, abandoning their own commerce, throwing away the only valuable stake they have left in the world, and in short, bent on their own ruin, we cannot suggest that they will ever, on any consideration, or for any equivalent, part with so valuable, indeed so inestimable a jewel, as the exclusive trade to their own plantations''.<br/>\n\nThe originators of the scheme knew that there was no money to invest in a trading venture, and no realistic expectation that there would ever be a trade to exploit, but nevertheless the potential for great wealth was widely publicised at every opportunity, so as to encourage interest in the scheme. The objective for the founders was to create a company which they could use to become wealthy and which offered  scope for further government deals.<ref>Carswell p. 56</ref>\n\n=== Flotation ===\n[[File:Bubble.folly.jpg|thumb|right|The \"night singer of shares\" sold stock on the streets during the South Sea Bubble (Amsterdam, 1720)]]\nThe [[royal charter]] for the company, based on that of the Bank of England, was drawn up by Blunt who was paid \u00a33,846 for his services in setting up the company. Directors would be elected every three years and shareholders would meet twice a year. The Company employed a Cashier, Secretary and Accountant. The Governor was intended as an honorary position, and was later customarily held by the monarch. The charter allowed the full court of directors to nominate a smaller committee to act on any matter on its behalf. Directors of the Bank of England and of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] were disbarred from being a director of the South Sea Company. Any ship of more than 500 tons owned by the Company was to have a Church of England clergyman on board.\n\nThe surrender of government debt for Company stock was to occur in five separate lots. The first two of these, totaling \u00a32.75 million from about 200 large investors, had already been arranged before the company's charter was issued on 10 September 1711. The government itself surrendered \u00a30.75 million of its own debt held by different departments (at that time individual office holders were at liberty to invest government funds under their control to their own advantage before it was required for government expenditure). Harley surrendered \u00a38,000 of debt and was appointed Governor of the new company. Blunt, Caswall and Sawbridge together surrendered \u00a365,000, Janssen \u00a325,000 of his own plus \u00a3250,000 from a foreign consortium, Decker \u00a349,000, Sir Ambrose Crawley \u00a336,791. The company had a Sub-Governor, Bateman; a Deputy Governor, Ongley; and 30 ordinary directors. In total, nine of the directors were politicians, five were members of the Sword Blade consortium, and seven more were financial magnates who had been attracted to the scheme.<ref>Carswell p.57,58</ref>\n\nThe company created a coat of arms with the motto ''A Gadibus usque ad Auroram'' (\"from Cadiz to the dawn\", from [[Juvenal]], [[Satires (Juvenal)|Satires]], 10) and rented a large house in the City of London as its headquarters. Seven sub-committees were created to handle its everyday business, the most important being the \"committee for the affairs of the company\". The Sword Blade company was retained as the Company's banker and on the strength of its new government connections issued notes in its own right, notwithstanding the Bank of England's monopoly. The task of the Company Secretary was to oversee trading activities; the Accountant, Grigsby, was responsible for registering and issuing stock; and the Cashier, Robert Knight, acted as Blunt's personal assistant at a salary of \u00a3200 per annum.<ref>Carswell p.60-63</ref>\n\n=== The slave trade ===\nThe [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 granted Britain an ''[[Asiento]]'' lasting 30 years to supply the Spanish colonies with 4,800 slaves per year. Britain was permitted to open offices in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Caracas]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Havana]], [[Panama]], [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]] and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] to arrange the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. One ship of no more than 500 tons could be sent to one of these places each year (the ''Nav\u00edo de Permiso'') with general trade goods. One quarter of the profits were to be reserved for the King of Spain. There was provision for two extra sailings at the start of the contract. The Asiento was granted in the name of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and then contracted to the company.<ref>Carswell p. 64-66</ref>\n\nBy July the company had arranged contracts with the [[Royal African Company]] to supply the necessary African slaves to Jamaica. Ten pounds was paid for a slave aged over 16, \u00a38 for one under 16 but over 10. Two-thirds were to be male, and 90% adult. The company trans-shipped 1,230 slaves from Jamaica to America in the first year, plus any that might have been added (against standing instructions) by the ship's captains on their own behalf. On arrival of the first cargoes, the local authorities refused to accept the Asiento, which had still not been officially confirmed there by the Spanish authorities. The slaves were eventually sold at a loss in the West Indies.<ref>Carswell p. 65-66</ref>\n\nIn 1714 the government announced that a quarter of profits would be reserved for the Queen and a further 7.5% for a financial advisor, Manasseh Gilligan. Some Company board members refused to accept the contract on these terms, and the government was obliged to reverse its decision.<ref>Carswell p. 67</ref>\n\nDespite these setbacks, the company continued, having raised \u00a3200,000 to finance the operations. In 1714 2,680 slaves were carried, and for 1716\u201317, 13,000 more, but the trade continued to be unprofitable. An import duty of 33 [[Spanish dollar|pieces of eight]] was charged on each slave (although for this purpose some slaves might be counted only as a fraction of a slave, depending on quality). One of the extra trade ships was sent to Cartagena in 1714 carrying woollen goods, despite warnings that there was no market for them there, and they remained unsold for two years.<ref>Carswell p. 66-67</ref>\n\n=== Changes of management ===\nThe company was heavily dependent on the goodwill of government; when the government changed, so too did the company board. In 1714 one of the directors who had been sponsored by Harley, Arthur Moore, had attempted to send 60 tons of private goods on board the company ship. He was dismissed as a director, but the result was the beginning of Harley's fall from favour with the company. On 27 July 1714, Harley was replaced as Lord High Treasurer as a result of a disagreement that had broken out within the Tory faction in parliament. Queen Anne died on 1 August 1714; and at the election of directors in 1715 the Prince of Wales (the future King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]) was elected as Governor of the Company. The new King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and the Prince of Wales both had significant holdings in the company, as did some prominent Whig politicians, including [[James Craggs the Elder]], the Earl of Halifax and Sir Joseph Jekyll. James Craggs, as Postmaster General, was responsible for intercepting mail on behalf of the government to obtain political and financial information. All Tory politicians were removed from the board and replaced with businessmen. The Whigs Horatio Townshend, brother in law of [[Robert Walpole]], and the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] were elected directors.\n\nThe new government led to a revival of the company's share value, which had fallen below its issue price. The previous government had failed to make the interest payments to the company for the last two years, owing more than \u00a31 million. The new administration insisted the debt be written off, but allowed the company to issue new shares to stockholders to the value of the missed payments. At around \u00a310 million, this now represented half the share capital issued in the entire country. In 1714 the company had 2,000 to 3,000 shareholders, more than either of its rivals.<ref>Carswell p.67-70</ref>\n\nBy the time of the next directors' elections in 1718 politics had changed again, with a schism within the Whigs between Walpole's faction supporting the Prince of Wales and [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]]'s supporting the King. Argyll and Townshend were dismissed as directors, as were surviving Tories Sir Richard Hoare and George Pitt, and King George I became governor. Four MPs remained directors, as did six people holding government financial offices. The Sword Blade Company remained bankers to the South Sea, and indeed had flourished despite the company's dubious legal position. Blunt and Sawbridge remained South Sea directors, and they had been joined by Gibbon and Child. Caswall had retired as a South Sea director to concentrate on the Sword Blade business. In November 1718 Sub-Governor Bateman and Deputy Governor Shepheard both died. Leaving aside the honorary position of Governor, this left the company suddenly without its two most senior and experienced directors. They were replaced by Sir John Fellowes as Sub-Governor and Charles Joye as Deputy.<ref>Carswell p.73-75</ref>\n\n=== War ===\nIn 1718 war broke out with Spain once again, in the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]]. The company's assets in South America were seized, which the company claimed cost it \u00a3300,000. Any prospect of profit from trade, for which the company had purchased ships and had been planning its next ventures, disappeared.<ref>Carswell p.75-76</ref>\n\n== Refinancing government debt ==\nEvents in France now came to influence the future of the company. A Scottish economist and financier, [[John Law (economist)|John Law]], exiled after killing a man in a duel, had travelled around Europe before settling in France. There he founded a bank, which in December 1718 became the Banque Royale, national bank of France, while Law himself was granted sweeping powers to control the economy of France, which operated largely by royal decree. Law's remarkable success was known in financial circles throughout Europe, and now came to inspire Blunt and his associates to make greater efforts to grow their own concerns.<ref>Carswell p.88-89</ref>\n\nIn February 1719 Craggs explained to the House of Commons a new scheme for improving the national debt by converting the annuities issued after the 1710 lottery into South Sea stock. By Act of Parliament, the company was granted the right to issue \u00a31,150 of new stock for every \u00a3100 per annum of annuity which was surrendered. The government would pay 5% per annum on the stock created, which would halve their annual bill. The conversion was voluntary, amounting to \u00a32.5 million new stock if all converted. The company was to make an additional new loan to the government pro-rata up to \u00a3750,000, again at 5%.<ref>Carswell p.89-90</ref>\n\nThe South Sea company presented the offer to the public in July 1719. In March there was an abortive attempt to restore the Old Pretender, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Edward Stuart]], to the throne of Britain, with a small landing of troops in Scotland. They were defeated at the [[Battle of Glen Shiel]] on 10 June. The Sword Blade company spread a rumour that the Pretender had been captured, and the general euphoria encouraged the South Sea share price to rise from \u00a3100, where it had been in the spring, to \u00a3114. Annuitants were still paid out at the same money value of shares, the company keeping the profit from the rise in value before issuing. About two-thirds of the in-force annuities were exchanged.\n\n=== Trading more debt for equity ===\n[[File:William Hogarth - The South Sea Scheme.png|thumb|right|350px|[[William Hogarth]], ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'' (1721). In the bottom left corner are Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish figures gambling, while in the middle there is a huge machine, like a merry-go-round, which people are boarding. At the top is a goat, written below which is \"Who'l Ride\". The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder, while the progress of the well-dressed people towards the ride in the middle represents the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the South Sea Company, which spent more time issuing stock than anything else.]]\n\nThe 1719 scheme was a distinct success from the government's perspective, and they sought to repeat it. Negotiations took place between Aislabie and Craggs for the government and Blunt, Cashier Knight and his assistant and Caswell. Janssen, the Sub Governor and Deputy Governor were also consulted but negotiations remained secret from most of the company. News from France was of fortunes being made investing in Law's bank, whose shares had risen sharply. Money was moving around Europe, and other flotations threatened to soak up available capital (two insurance schemes in December 1719 each sought to raise \u00a33 million).<ref>Carswell p.100-102</ref>\n\nPlans were made for a new scheme to take over most of the unconsolidated national debt of Britain (\u00a330,981,712) in exchange for company shares. Annuities were valued as a lump sum necessary to produce the annual income over the original term at an assumed interest of 5%, which favoured those with shorter terms still to run. The government agreed to pay the same amount to the company for all the fixed term repayable debt as it had been paying before, but after seven years the 5% interest rate would fall to 4% on both the new annuity debt and also that taken over previously. After the first year, the company was to give the government \u00a33 million in four quarterly installments. New stock would be created at a face value equal to the debt, but the share price was still rising and sales of the remaining stock, i.e. the excess of the total market value of the stock over the amount of the debt, would be used to raise the government fee plus a profit for the company. The more the price rose in advance of conversion, the more the company would make. Before the scheme, payments were costing the government \u00a31.5 million per year.<ref name=\"auto\">Carswell p.102-107</ref>\n\nIn summary, the total government debt in 1719 was \u00a350 million:\n\n* \u00a318.3m was held by three large corporations:\n** \u00a33.4m by the [[Bank of England]]\n** \u00a33.2m by the [[British East India Company]]\n** \u00a311.7m by the South Sea Company\n* Privately held redeemable debt amounted to \u00a316.5m\n* \u00a315m consisted of irredeemable annuities, long-fixed-term annuities of 72\u201387 years, and short annuities of 22 years remaining to expiry.\n\nThe purpose of this conversion was similar to the old one: debt holders and annuitants might receive less return in total, but an illiquid investment was transformed into shares which could be readily traded. Shares backed by national debt were considered a safe investment and a convenient way to hold and move money: far easier and safer than metal coins. The only alternative safe asset, land, was much harder to sell and it was legally much more complex to transfer ownership.\n\nThe government received a cash payment and lower overall interest on the debt. Importantly, it also gained control over when the debt had to be repaid, which was not before seven years but then at its discretion. This avoided the risk that debt might become repayable at some future point just when the government needed to borrow more, and could be forced into paying higher interest rates. The payment to the government was to be used to buy in any debt not subscribed to the scheme, which although it helped the government also helped the company by removing possibly competing securities from the market, including large holdings by the Bank of England.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nCompany stock was now trading at \u00a3123, so the issue amounted to an injection of \u00a35 million of new money into a booming economy just as interest rates were falling. [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) for Britain at this point was estimated as \u00a364.4 million.[http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/budget_pie_ukgs.php?span=ukgs302&year=1717&view=1&expand=&units=b&fy=2010&state=UK#ukgs302]\n\n==== Public announcement ====\nOn 21 January the plan was presented to the board of the South Sea Company, and on 22 January [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[John Aislabie]] presented it to Parliament. The House was stunned into silence, but on recovering proposed that the Bank of England should be invited to make a better offer. In response, the South Sea increased its cash payment to \u00a33.5 million, while the Bank proposed to undertake the conversion with a payment of \u00a35.5 million and a fixed conversion price of \u00a3170 per \u00a3100 face value Bank stock. On 1 February, the company negotiators led by Blunt raised their offer to \u00a34 million plus a proportion of \u00a33.5 million depending on how much of the debt was converted. They also agreed that the interest rate would reduce after four years instead of seven, and agreed to sell on behalf of the government \u00a31 million of Exchequer bills (formerly handled by the Bank). The House accepted the South Sea offer. Bank stock fell sharply.<ref>Carswell p.112-113</ref>\n\nPerhaps the first sign of difficulty came when the South Sea Company announced that its Christmas 1719 dividend would be deferred for 12 months. The company now embarked on a show of gratitude to its friends. Select individuals were sold a parcel of company stock at the current price. The transactions were recorded by Knight in the names of intermediaries, but no payments were received and no stock issued \u2013 indeed the company had none to issue until the conversion of debt began. The individual received an option to sell his stock back to the company at any future date at whatever market price might then apply. Shares went to the Craggs: [[James Craggs the Elder|the Elder]] and [[James Craggs the Younger|the Younger]]; [[John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower|Lord Gower]]; [[George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]; and four other MPs. [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] would gain \u00a3500 for every pound that stock rose; George I's mistress, their children and Countess Platen \u00a3120 per pound rise, Aislabie \u00a3200 per pound, [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] \u00a3600 per pound. Others invested money, including the [[Richard Hampden (1674\u20131728)|Treasurer to the Navy, Hampden]], who invested \u00a325,000 of government money on his own behalf.<ref>Carswell p.114-118</ref>\n\nThe proposal was accepted in a slightly altered form in April 1720. Crucial in this conversion was the proportion of holders of irredeemable annuities who could be tempted to convert their securities at a high price for the new shares. (Holders of redeemable debt had effectively no other choice but to subscribe.) The South Sea Company could set the conversion price but could not diverge much from the market price of its shares. The company ultimately acquired 85% of the redeemables and 80% of the irredeemables.\n\n=== Inflating the share price ===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ssbprice.jpg|thumb|The South Sea share]] -->\n[[File:South-sea-bubble-chart.png|thumb|right|Chart of company stock prices.]]\nThe company then set to talking up its stock with \"the most extravagant rumours\" of the value of its potential trade in the New World; this was followed by a wave of \"speculating frenzy\". The share price had risen from the time the scheme was proposed: from \u00a3128 in January 1720, to \u00a3175 in February, \u00a3330 in March and, following the scheme's acceptance, \u00a3550 at the end of May.\n\nWhat may have supported the company's high multiples (its [[P/E ratio]]) was a fund of credit (known to the market) of \u00a370 million available for commercial expansion which had been made available through substantial support, apparently, by Parliament and the King.\n\nShares in the company were \"sold\" to politicians at the current market price; however, rather than paying for the shares, these recipients simply held on to what shares they had been offered, with the option of selling them back to the company when and as they chose, receiving as \"profit\" the increase in market price. This method, while winning over the heads of government, the King's mistress, et al., also had the advantage of binding their interests to the interests of the Company: in order to secure their own profits, they had to help drive up the stock. Meanwhile, by publicising the names of their elite stockholders, the Company managed to clothe itself in an aura of legitimacy, which attracted and kept other buyers.\n\n=== Bubble Act ===\n{{Main|Bubble Act}}\nThe South Sea Company was by no means the only company seeking to raise money from investors in 1720. A large number of other joint-stock companies had been created making extravagant (sometimes fraudulent) claims about foreign or other ventures or bizarre schemes. Others represented potentially sound, although novel, schemes, such as for founding insurance companies. These were nicknamed \"Bubbles\". Some of the companies had no legal basis, while others, such as the Hollow Sword Blade company acting as the South Sea's banker, used existing chartered companies for purposes entirely different from their creation. The York Buildings Company was set up to provide water to London, but was purchased by Case Billingsley who used it to purchase confiscated Jacobite estates in Scotland, which then formed the assets of an insurance company.<ref name=\"auto1\">Carswell p.116-117</ref>\n\nOn 22 February 1720 John Hungerford raised the question of bubble companies in the House of Commons, and persuaded the House to set up a committee, which he chaired, to investigate. He identified a number of companies which between them sought to raise \u00a340 million in capital. The committee investigated the companies, establishing a principle that companies should not be operating outside the objects specified in their charters. A potential embarrassment for the South Sea was avoided when the question of the Hollow Sword Blade Company arose. Difficulty was avoided by flooding the committee with MPs who were supporters of the South Sea, and voting down the proposal to investigate the Hollow Sword by 75 to 25. (At this time, committees of the House were either 'Open' or 'secret'. A secret committee was one with a fixed set of members who could vote on its proceedings. By contrast, any MP could join in with an 'open' committee and vote on its proceedings.) Stanhope, who was a member of the committee, received \u00a350,000 of the 'resaleable' South Sea stock from Sawbridge, a director of the Hollow Sword, at about this time. Hungerford had previously been expelled from the Commons for accepting a bribe.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\nAmongst the bubble companies investigated were two supported by Lords Onslow and Chetwynd respectively, for insuring shipping. These were criticised heavily, and the questionable dealings of the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General in trying to obtain charters for the companies led to both being replaced. However, the schemes had the support of [[Robert Walpole|Walpole]] and [[James Craggs the Younger|Craggs]], so that the larger part of the Bubble Act (which finally resulted in June 1720 from the committee's investigations) was devoted to creating charters for the [[Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation]] and the [[London Assurance Corporation]]. The companies were required to pay \u00a3300,000 for the privilege. The Act required that a joint stock company could only be incorporated by Act of Parliament or [[Royal charter]]. The prohibition on unauthorised joint stock ventures was not repealed until 1825.<ref>Carswell p.138-140</ref>\n\nThe passing of the Act gave a boost to the South Sea Company, its shares leaping to \u00a3890 in early June. This peak encouraged people to start to sell; to counterbalance this the company's directors ordered their agents to buy, which succeeded in propping the price up at around \u00a3750.\n\n=== Top reached ===\n[[File:South Sea Bubble Cards-Tree.png|thumb|200px|Tree caricature from Bubble Cards.]]\nThe price of the stock went up over the course of a single year from about \u00a3100 to almost \u00a31000 per share. Its success caused a country-wide frenzy\u2014[[herd behavior]]<ref>Paul, Helen Julia (2010) The South Sea Bubble: an economic history of its origins and consequences, Routledge Explorations in Economic History, Routledge, London.</ref>\u2014as all types of people, from peasants to lords, developed a feverish interest in investing: in South Seas primarily, but in stocks generally.

Earlier in the year John Blunt had come up with an idea to prop up the share price: the company would lend people money to buy its shares. As a result, many shareholders could not pay for their shares except by selling them.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nFurthermore, a scramble for liquidity appeared internationally as \"bubbles\" were also ending in Amsterdam and Paris. The collapse coincided with the fall of the [[Mississippi Company]] of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]] in France. As a result, the price of South Sea shares began to decline.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Recriminations ===\nBy the end of September the stock had fallen to \u00a3150. Company failures now extended to [[bank]]s and [[goldsmith]]s, as they could not collect loans made on the stock, and thousands of individuals were ruined, including many members of the [[aristocracy]]. With investors outraged, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was recalled in December and an investigation began. Reporting in 1721, it revealed widespread [[fraud]] amongst the company directors and corruption in the Cabinet. Among those implicated were [[John Aislabie]] (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), [[James Craggs the Elder]] (the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]]), [[James Craggs the Younger]] (the [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]]), and even [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] (the heads of the Ministry). Craggs the Elder and Craggs the Younger both died in disgrace; the remainder were [[impeached]] for their corruption. The Commons found Aislabie guilty of the \"most notorious, dangerous and infamous corruption\", and he was imprisoned.\n\nThe newly appointed [[First Lord of the Treasury]], [[Robert Walpole]], successfully  restored public confidence in the financial system. However, public opinion, as shaped by the many prominent men who lost money, demanded revenge. Walpole supervised the process, which removed all 33 of the company directors and stripped them of, on average, 82% of their wealth. The money went to the victims and the stock of the South Sea Company was divided between the Bank of England and the East India Company. Walpole made sure that King George and his mistresses were protected, and by a margin of three votes he managed to save several key government officials from impeachment. In the process, Walpole won plaudits as the savior of the financial system while establishing himself as the dominant figure in British politics; historians credit him for rescuing the Whig government, and indeed the Hanoverian Dynasty, from total disgrace.<ref> Marshall, pp 127-30. </ref><ref>Richard A.

After [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] became the King of Spain, Britain obtained at the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] the rights to the slave trade to the Spanish Indies (or [[Asiento]]) for 30 years. Those rights were previously held by the [[Compagnie de Guin\u00e9e et de l'Assiente du Royaume de la France]].\n\nThe South Sea Company board opposed taking on the slave trade that had showed little profitability when chartered companies had engaged in it, but it was the only legal type of commerce with the Spanish Colonies as they were a closed market{{clarify|date=February 2014}}. To increase the profitability, the Asiento contract included the right to send one yearly 500 ton ship to the fairs at Portobello and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] loaded with duty-free merchandises, called the ''Nav\u00edo de Permiso''.\nThe Crown of England and the King of Spain were each entitled to 25% of the profits, according to the terms of the contract, that was a copy of the French Asiento contract, but [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] soon renounced her share. The King of Spain did not receive any payments due to him, and this was one of the sources of contention between the Spanish Crown and the South Sea Company.\n\nAs was the case for previous holders of the Asiento, the Portuguese and the French, the profit was not in the slave trade but in the illegal contraband goods smuggled in the slave ships and in the annual ship. Those goods were sold at the Spanish colonies at a handsome price as they were in high demand and constituted unfair competition with taxed goods, proving an important drain on the Spanish Crown trade income.\nThe relationship between the South Sea Company and the Government of Spain was always bad, and worsened with time. The Company complained of searches and seizures of goods, lack of profitability, and confiscation of properties during the wars between Britain and Spain of 1718\u20131723 and 1727\u20131729, during which the operations of the Company were suspended. The Government of Spain complained of the illegal trade, failure of the company to present its accounts as stipulated by the contract, and non-payment of the King's share of the profits.\nThese claims were a major cause of deteriorating relations between the two countries in 1738; and although the Prime Minister [[Robert Walpole|Walpole]] opposed war, there was strong support for it from the King, the House of Commons, and a faction in his own Cabinet. Walpole was able to negotiate a treaty with the King of Spain at the [[Convention of Pardo]] in January 1739 that stipulated that Spain would pay British merchants \u00a395,000 in compensation for captures and seized goods, while the South Sea Company would pay the Spanish Crown \u00a368,000 in due proceeds from the Asiento. The South Sea Company refused to pay those proceeds and the King of Spain retained payment of the compensation until payment from the South Sea Company could be secured. The break up of relations between the South Sea Company and the Spanish Government was a prelude to the ''[[War of Jenkins' Ear|Guerra del Asiento]]'', as the first [[Royal Navy]] fleets departed in July 1739 for the Caribbean, prior to the declaration of war, which lasted from October 1739 until 1748. This war is known as the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]].<ref>Nelson (1945) states that the substantial illicit trade pursued by the South Sea Company officials under the Asiento \u201cmust be considered as a major cause of the War of Jenkins' Ear because it threatened to destroy the entire commercial framework of the Spanish Empire&nbsp;... Unable to accept the destruction of its commercial system, Spain attempted to negotiate but requested that the company, as an evidence of good faith, should open its accounts for inspection by the Spanish representatives. Naturally, the directors refused, for compliance would have meant the complete exposure of the illegal traffic. Neither Spain nor the South Sea Company would yield. War was the inevitable result\u201d.</ref><ref>Brown (1926, p. 663) says that The failure to comply with the accounting provisions of the Asiento treaty (in the context of Spanish knowledge of secret accounts kept by the South Sea Company which would prove clandestine trading) was a constant source of the friction which culminated in armed conflict.</ref><ref>For Hildner (1938), the war of 1739 might have been averted if the issues addressed by the commission established in 1732 to settle disputes over the Asiento had been resolved.</ref>\n\n=== Slave trade under the Asiento ===\n{{Main|Asiento}}\n[[File:1713 Asiento contract.png|thumb|Cover of the English translation of the Asiento contract signed by Britain and Spain in 1713 as part of the Utrecht treaty that ended the War of Spanish Succession. The contract granted exclusive rights to Britain to sell slaves in the Spanish Indies.]]\nUnder the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], Spain was the only European power that could not establish factories in Africa to purchase slaves. The slaves for the Spanish America were provided by companies that were granted exclusive rights to their trade. This monopoly contract was called the slave [[Asiento]]. Between 1701 and 1713 the Asiento contract was granted to France. In 1711 Britain had created the South Sea Company to reduce debt and to trade with the Spanish America, but that commerce was illegal without a permit from Spain, and the only existing permit was the Asiento for the slave trade, so at the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 Britain obtained the transfer of the Asiento contract from French to British hands for the next 30 years.\nThe board of directors was reluctant to take on the slave trade that was not an object of the company and had shown little profitability when carried out by chartered companies, but they finally agreed on 26 March 1714. The Asiento set a sale quota of 4800 units of slaves per year. An adult male slave counted as one unit; females and children counted as fractions of a unit. Initially the slaves were provided by the [[Royal African Company]].\n\nThe South Sea Company established slave reception factories at [[Cartagena, Colombia]], [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]], Panama, [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]], [[La Guaira]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[La Havana]] and [[Santiago de Cuba]], and slave deposits at [[Jamaica]] and [[Barbados]]. Despite problems with speculation, the South Sea Company was relatively successful at [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trading]] and meeting its quota (it was unusual for other, similarly chartered companies to fulfill their quotas). According to records compiled by David Eltis and others, during the course of 96 voyages in 25 years, the South Sea Company purchased 34,000 slaves, of whom 30,000 survived the voyage across the Atlantic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/wm/58.1/eltis.html|title=History Cooperative \u2013 A Short History of Nearly Everything!|website=History Cooperative|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20091020132439/http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/wm/58.1/eltis.html|archivedate=2009-10-20}}</ref> (Thus about 11% of the slaves died on the voyage: a relatively low mortality rate for the [[Middle Passage|Middle Crossing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/paul.doc|title=The South Sea Company's slaving activities|first=Helen|last=Paul|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209151433/http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/paul.doc|archivedate=2012-12-09}}</ref>) The company persisted with the slave trade through two wars with Spain and the calamitous 1720 commercial [[Economic bubble|bubble]].

This was an unprecedented concession that broke two centuries of strict exclusion of foreign merchants from the Spanish Empire.<ref>Walker, G. J. (1979), p. 101</ref>\n\nThe first ship to head for the Americas, the ''Royal Prince'', was scheduled for 1714 but was delayed until August 1716. In consideration of the three annual ships missed since the date of the Asiento, the permitted tonnage of the next ten ships was raised to 650.<ref>Archivo General de Indias, Seville, Spain IG2785</ref> Actually only seven annual ships sailed during the Asiento, the last one being the Royal Caroline in 1732. The company's failure to produce accounts for all the annual ships but the first one, and lack of payment of the proceeds to the Spanish Crown from the profits for all the annual ships, resulted in no more permits being granted to the Company's ships after the Royal Caroline trip of 1732\u20131734.\n\nIn contrast to the legitimate trade in slaves, the regular trade of the annual ships generated healthy returns, in some case profits were over 100%.<ref>McLachlan, (1940), pp. 130-131</ref> Accounts for the voyage of the ''Royal Prince'' were not presented until 1733, following continuous demands by Spanish officials.

The products of their \"whale-fishery\" were to be free of customs and other duties. Partly due to maritime disruption caused by wars with France, the Greenland Company failed financially within a few years. In 1722 Henry Elking published a proposal, directed at the governors of the South Sea Company, that they should resume the \"Greenland Trade\" and send ships to catch whales in the Arctic. He made very detailed suggestions about how the ships should be crewed and equipped.<ref>Elking, Henry [1722](1980). ''A view of the Greenland Trade and whale-fishery''. Reprinted: Whitby: Caedmon. {{ISBN|0-905355-13-X}}</ref>\n\nThe British Parliament confirmed that a British Arctic \"whale-fishery\" would continue to benefit from freedom from customs duties, and in 1724 the South Sea Company decided to commence whaling. They had 12 whale-ships built on the River Thames and these went to the Greenland seas in 1725. Further ships were built in later years, but the venture was not successful. There were hardly any experienced whalemen remaining in Britain, and the Company had to engage Dutch and Danish whalemen for the key posts aboard their ships: for instance all commanding officers and harpooners were hired from the [[North Frisia]]n island of [[F\u00f6hr]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Uwe |last=Zacchi |language=German |title=Menschen von F\u00f6hr.

By 1732 the Company had accumulated a net loss of \u00a3177,782 from their eight years of Arctic whaling.<ref>Anderson, Adam [1801](1967). ''The Origin of Commerce''. Reprinted: New York: Kelley.</ref>\n\nThe South Sea Company directors appealed to the British government for further support. Parliament had passed an Act in 1732 that extended the duty-free concessions for a further nine years. In 1733 an Act was passed that also granted a government subsidy to British Arctic whalers, the first in a long series of such Acts that continued and modified the whaling subsidies throughout the 18th century. This, and the subsequent Acts, required the whalers to meet conditions regarding the crewing and equipping of the whale-ships that closely resembled the conditions suggested by Elking in 1722.<ref>Evans, Martin H. (2005). Statutory requirements regarding surgeons on British whale-ships. ''The Mariner's Mirror'' '''91''' (1) 7-12.</ref>\nIn spite of the extended duty-free concessions, and the prospect of real subsidies as well, the Court and Directors of the South Sea Company decided that they could not expect to make profits from Arctic whaling. They sent out no more whale-ships after the loss-making 1732 season.\n\n== Government debt after the Seven Years' War ==\nThe company continued its trade (when not interrupted by war) until the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763). However, its main function was always managing government debt, rather than trading with the Spanish colonies. The South Sea Company continued its management of the part of the [[Government debt|National Debt]] until it was disestablished in 1853, at which point the debt was reconsolidated. The debt was not paid off by [[World War I]], at which point it was consolidated again, under terms that allowed the government to avoid repaying the principal.\n\n== Armorials ==\nThe armorials of the South Sea Company, according to a [[grant of arms]] dated 31 October 1711, were: ''Azure, a globe whereon are represented the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn all proper and in sinister chief point two herrings haurient in saltire argent crowned or, in a canton the united arms of Great Britain''.

Boulger had the honour of captaining the team to Australia's first [[Speedway World Team Cup]] victory. It was Australia's first World title in any speedway competition since Young's World Championship win in 1952.\n\n==Career summary==\n\n===Australia===\nJohn Boulger, whose father was a mechanic for international solo star Merv Harding, started his racing career in 1965 racing [[Motocross|scrambles]] as a sidecar passenger with friend Brenton Hanks (which only lasted a year) before moving into speedway. His first race was at the [[Broken Hill Speedway]] in October 1966 where he lost an oil tank and seized the engine in his first meeting. He then got his break when he tagged along with leading Adelaide [[Sidecar speedway|sidecar]] rider Len Bowes to the [[Melbourne Speedway (Brooklyn)|Northern Park Raceway]] in [[Melbourne]]. As a favour to Bowes, the promoter let Boulger ride just expecting him to make up the numbers, but everyone received a shock when Boulger broke the track record in his first ride.\n\nHis home track was the famed, {{convert|358|m|yd}} [[Rowley Park Speedway]] in Adelaide and he made his debut there on 29 October 1966.<ref name=\"Post\">\"Personal Profile: John Boulger\", ''[[Speedway Post]]'', volume 5, no. 12, July 1969, p. 16-17</ref> He quickly went from promising rookie to star rider within a couple of seasons, and would become the best South Australian rider of his generation, and regarded as one of the states best ever riders alongside Jack Young.\n\nAfter finishing second to [[Sydney]]'s [[Jim Airey]] at the {{convert|509|m|yd}} [[Sydney Showground Speedway|Sydney Showground]] in 1970, Boulger won his first Australian Solo Championship in 1971 at [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]'s \u2153 mile ({{convert|586|m|yd}}) [[Claremont Speedway]] after a bold passing move on local favourite [[Chum Taylor]] in the last corner of the deciding heat to give him a 15-point maximum.<ref name=\"Extra\">\"A Fitting Climax to John Boulger's Year\", ''[[Motor Cycle News]] Speedway Extra 1971'', p. 12</ref> He finished in third place at Rowley Park in 1972 behind Airey and [[Denmark]]s [[1971 Individual Speedway World Championship|reigning World Champion]] [[Ole Olsen (speedway rider)|Ole Olsen]], and won his last title in 1973 at the Sydney Showground with a 15-point maximum, leaving defending champion and \"King of the Royale\" Airey languishing in 4th place. Boulger then finished the 1974 championship at the {{convert|425|m|yd}} [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] in 2nd place behind local rider Steve Reinke to cap a four-year run where he never finished the Australian title off the podium. He would place once more finishing 3rd in 1979 at the  {{convert|302|m|yd}} [[Olympic Park Speedway (Mildura)|Olympic Park Speedway]] in [[Mildura]] behind local favourites [[Phil Crump]] and [[Danny Kennedy (speedway rider)|Danny Kennedy]]. Boulger's win in 1973 was the last time a South Australian rider would win the national title until [[Ryan Sullivan]] won in 2004.\n\nDuring the 1970s Boulger had a virtual stranglehold on the [[South Australian Individual Speedway Championship|South Australian Solo Championship]]. He won his first title in 1970 before winning a record seven in a row between 1972 and 1978, all held at Rowley Park Speedway. He would win his ninth and last SA Championship at the new, {{convert|430|m|yd}} [[Speedway City|Speedway Park]] in 1982. Boulger's ninth SA title saw him equal the record of nine wins by Jack Young. As of 2016, this record still stands, with the next best record being five wins by [[Queensland]]er [[Troy Batchelor]]. Boulger narrowly missed equaling Young's record in 1981 when he finished second in the championship behind [[Tony Boyle (speedway rider)|Tony Boyle]] at Speedway Park. Boulger was undefeated in his first three rides, and was leading his fourth race when his front forks broke forcing him to crash and not finish the race.\n\nJohn Boulger won the inaugural [[Australasian Individual Speedway Championship|Australasian Championship]] at the [[Western Springs Stadium]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] in [[1976 Australasian Individual Speedway Championship|1976]] defeating [[Billy Sanders]], Phil Crump and multiple World Champion [[Ivan Mauger]] (the Australasian Final was introduced as a World Championship qualifying round for Australian and New Zealand riders). He then went on to finish in a 3-way tie for first place in [[1977 Australasian Individual Speedway Championship|1977]] at the Sydney Showground with Mauger and Crump, before eventually finishing third after a runoff. Later in 1982 he won the [[Australian Long Track Championship]] in the South Australian town of [[Morgan, South Australia|Morgan]] in 1982.\n\nBoulger retired from riding in 1984 and decided to stay in speedway, first by teaching young riders the art of racing a Solo motorbike, with many of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's racing at the [[Sidewinders Speedway|Sidewinders Junior Speedway]] in Adelaide which opened in 1978. Boulger has been a long time supporter of Sidewinders and during the early-mid 1980s was a mentor to a number of younger riders including [[Steve Baker (speedway rider)|Steve Baker]], [[Mark Fiora]], [[Shane Parker (speedway rider)|Shane Parker]], [[Craig Hodgson]] and [[Shane Bowes]], the son of Boulger's long time friend and the 1968 [[Australian Sidecar Speedway Championship|Australian Sidecar Champion]] Len Bowes.\n\nIn 1985 he started racing [[Sprint car racing|Sprintcars]] before moving on to drive Speedcars with some success, including winning the prestigious \"Harry Neale Memorial\" at Speedway Park in 1987. Boulger would race for a few more seasons before retiring from the sport in the mid-1990s to concentrate on driving his [[taxicab|taxi]].<ref>http://www.rowleypark.com/plugins/p17_image_gallery/popup.php?categoryid=3&p17_sectionid=1&p17_imageid=522</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gillmanspeedway.com/release.asp?NewsId=27979 |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218094210/http://www.gillmanspeedway.com/release.asp?NewsId=27979 |archive-date=18 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, John Boulger was inducted into the [[Australian Speedway Hall of Fame]].\n\nOn 29 November 2014, John Boulger was inducted into the Motorcycling South Australia Hall of Fame.\n\n===England===\nJohn Boulger arrived in England in 1967 to ride for the [[Long Eaton Archers]], scoring a paid 12 point maximum in just his third match against [[Exeter Falcons|Exeter]]. He was recommended to the Long Eaton management by British star [[Ray Wilson (speedway rider)|Ray Wilson]] who had been on the lookout for Australian talent when he rode in Adelaide in 1967 and picked Boulger as a future star. Boulger appeared in 33 league matches during 1967 for Long Eaton, finishing with a 5.95 points average.\n\nIn 1968, Long Eaton management moved the team to [[Leicester]] where they would become the [[Leicester Lions]] and Boulger remained for six seasons, helping the Lions to second place in the [[1971 British Speedway League|1971]] [[British League]], and gradually improving his average to 9.46 by 1972. In 1973 he replaced Wilson as captain of the Lions and averaged 10.25 points to place 7th in the Riders' Championship (Wilson, that years [[British Speedway Championship|British Champion]], would finish second in the Riders' Championship behind multiple World Champion [[Ivan Mauger]]). In 1974 Boulger moved to ride for [[Cradley Heath Heathens|Cradley United]] where he remained until 1976 before returning to Leicester in 1977. He would remain with the Lions until 1979 when he retired from British League racing in order to spend more time with his family and on his business interests in Adelaide.<ref name=\"Jones\">Jones, Alan (2010) ''Speedway in Leicester: The Lions Roar'', Automedia, p.159-160</ref>\n\n===International===\nBoulger had the honor of captaining the victorious [[Australia national speedway team|Australian]] team at the [[1976 Speedway World Team Cup]] held at [[London]]'s [[White City Stadium]]. He also partnered [[Phil Crump]] in the [[1974 Speedway World Pairs Championship|1974 World Pairs final]] at [[Hyde Road (speedway)|Hyde Road]] in [[Manchester]], finishing in second place behind the [[Sweden national speedway team|Swedish]] pairing of [[1974 Individual Speedway World Championship|1974 World Champion]] [[Anders Michanek]], and his partner [[S\u00f6ren Sj\u00f6sten]]. Boulger and Crump would finish 5th in the [[1975 Speedway World Pairs Championship|1975 World Pairs final]] at the [[Olympic Stadium (Wroc\u0142aw)|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Poland]]. 1975 would prove to be Boulger's last World Pairs Final appearance.\n\nJohn Boulger qualified for two [[Speedway World Championship|World Final]]'s during his career. He finished 13th with 6 points in [[1973 Individual Speedway World Championship|1973]] at the [[Silesian Stadium]] in [[Chorz\u00f3w]] ([[Katowice]]), Poland in front of the largest speedway attendance in history, an estimated 130,000 where he was the only Australian to qualify and other than runner-up Ivan Mauger was the highest placed [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] rider alongside English whiz-kid [[Peter Collins (speedway rider)|Peter Collins]] who also finished with 6 points (Collins would go on to win the World Championship at the same venue in [[1976 Individual Speedway World Championship|1976]]). Boulger also rode in the [[1977 Individual Speedway World Championship|1977 World Final]] at the [[Ullevi|Ullevi Stadium]] in [[G\u00f6teborg]], [[Sweden]], where on a wet track he finished 12th with 5 points from his 5 rides.

As of 2016, this record still stands, with the next best record being five wins by [[Queensland]]er [[Troy Batchelor]]. Boulger narrowly missed equaling Young's record in 1981 when he finished second in the championship behind [[Tony Boyle (speedway rider)|Tony Boyle]] at Speedway Park. Boulger was undefeated in his first three rides, and was leading his fourth race when his front forks broke forcing him to crash and not finish the race.\n\nJohn Boulger won the inaugural [[Australasian Individual Speedway Championship|Australasian Championship]] at the [[Western Springs Stadium]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] in [[1976 Australasian Individual Speedway Championship|1976]] defeating [[Billy Sanders]], Phil Crump and multiple World Champion [[Ivan Mauger]] (the Australasian Final was introduced as a World Championship qualifying round for Australian and New Zealand riders). He then went on to finish in a 3-way tie for first place in [[1977 Australasian Individual Speedway Championship|1977]] at the Sydney Showground with Mauger and Crump, before eventually finishing third after a runoff. Later in 1982 he won the [[Australian Long Track Championship]] in the South Australian town of [[Morgan, South Australia|Morgan]] in 1982.\n\nBoulger retired from riding in 1984 and decided to stay in speedway, first by teaching young riders the art of racing a Solo motorbike, with many of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's racing at the [[Sidewinders Speedway|Sidewinders Junior Speedway]] in Adelaide which opened in 1978. Boulger has been a long time supporter of Sidewinders and during the early-mid 1980s was a mentor to a number of younger riders including [[Steve Baker (speedway rider)|Steve Baker]], [[Mark Fiora]], [[Shane Parker (speedway rider)|Shane Parker]], [[Craig Hodgson]] and [[Shane Bowes]], the son of Boulger's long time friend and the 1968 [[Australian Sidecar Speedway Championship|Australian Sidecar Champion]] Len Bowes.\n\nIn 1985 he started racing [[Sprint car racing|Sprintcars]] before moving on to drive Speedcars with some success, including winning the prestigious \"Harry Neale Memorial\" at Speedway Park in 1987. Boulger would race for a few more seasons before retiring from the sport in the mid-1990s to concentrate on driving his [[taxicab|taxi]].<ref>http://www.rowleypark.com/plugins/p17_image_gallery/popup.php?categoryid=3&p17_sectionid=1&p17_imageid=522</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gillmanspeedway.com/release.asp?NewsId=27979 |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218094210/http://www.gillmanspeedway.com/release.asp?NewsId=27979 |archive-date=18 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, John Boulger was inducted into the [[Australian Speedway Hall of Fame]].\n\nOn 29 November 2014, John Boulger was inducted into the Motorcycling South Australia Hall of Fame.\n\n===England===\nJohn Boulger arrived in England in 1967 to ride for the [[Long Eaton Archers]], scoring a paid 12 point maximum in just his third match against [[Exeter Falcons|Exeter]]. He was recommended to the Long Eaton management by British star [[Ray Wilson (speedway rider)|Ray Wilson]] who had been on the lookout for Australian talent when he rode in Adelaide in 1967 and picked Boulger as a future star. Boulger appeared in 33 league matches during 1967 for Long Eaton, finishing with a 5.95 points average.\n\nIn 1968, Long Eaton management moved the team to [[Leicester]] where they would become the [[Leicester Lions]] and Boulger remained for six seasons, helping the Lions to second place in the [[1971 British Speedway League|1971]] [[British League]], and gradually improving his average to 9.46 by 1972. In 1973 he replaced Wilson as captain of the Lions and averaged 10.25 points to place 7th in the Riders' Championship (Wilson, that years [[British Speedway Championship|British Champion]], would finish second in the Riders' Championship behind multiple World Champion [[Ivan Mauger]]). In 1974 Boulger moved to ride for [[Cradley Heath Heathens|Cradley United]] where he remained until 1976 before returning to Leicester in 1977. He would remain with the Lions until 1979 when he retired from British League racing in order to spend more time with his family and on his business interests in Adelaide.<ref name=\"Jones\">Jones, Alan (2010) ''Speedway in Leicester: The Lions Roar'', Automedia, p.159-160</ref>\n\n===International===\nBoulger had the honor of captaining the victorious [[Australia national speedway team|Australian]] team at the [[1976 Speedway World Team Cup]] held at [[London]]'s [[White City Stadium]]. He also partnered [[Phil Crump]] in the [[1974 Speedway World Pairs Championship|1974 World Pairs final]] at [[Hyde Road (speedway)|Hyde Road]] in [[Manchester]], finishing in second place behind the [[Sweden national speedway team|Swedish]] pairing of [[1974 Individual Speedway World Championship|1974 World Champion]] [[Anders Michanek]], and his partner [[S\u00f6ren Sj\u00f6sten]]. Boulger and Crump would finish 5th in the [[1975 Speedway World Pairs Championship|1975 World Pairs final]] at the [[Olympic Stadium (Wroc\u0142aw)|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Poland]]. 1975 would prove to be Boulger's last World Pairs Final appearance.\n\nJohn Boulger qualified for two [[Speedway World Championship|World Final]]'s during his career. He finished 13th with 6 points in [[1973 Individual Speedway World Championship|1973]] at the [[Silesian Stadium]] in [[Chorz\u00f3w]] ([[Katowice]]), Poland in front of the largest speedway attendance in history, an estimated 130,000 where he was the only Australian to qualify and other than runner-up Ivan Mauger was the highest placed [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] rider alongside English whiz-kid [[Peter Collins (speedway rider)|Peter Collins]] who also finished with 6 points (Collins would go on to win the World Championship at the same venue in [[1976 Individual Speedway World Championship|1976]]). Boulger also rode in the [[1977 Individual Speedway World Championship|1977 World Final]] at the [[Ullevi|Ullevi Stadium]] in [[G\u00f6teborg]], [[Sweden]], where on a wet track he finished 12th with 5 points from his 5 rides.

Treatment of HIV/AIDS is primarily via a \"drug cocktail\" of [[antiretroviral drugs]], and education programs to help people avoid infection.\n\nInitially, infected foreign nationals were turned back at the U.S. border to help prevent additional infections. The number of U.S. deaths from AIDS have declined sharply since the early years of the disease's presentation domestically. In the United States in 2016, 1.1 million people aged over 13 lived with an HIV infection, of whom 14% were unaware of their infection.<ref name=\"CDCBasicStats\" /> [[Homosexuality|Gay]] and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] men, [[African Americans]], and [[Latinos]] remain disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS in the U.S.\n\n== Mortality and morbidity ==\n\n{{As of|2016}}, about 675,000 people have died of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, and even today, nearly 13,000 people with AIDS in the United States die each year.<ref name=CDC2016Today>{{cite web|title=Today's HIV/AIDS Epidemic Factsheet|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/factsheets/todaysepidemic-508.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. government|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith improved treatments and better [[Post-exposure prophylaxis|prophylaxis]] against opportunistic infections, [[mortality rate|death rates]] have quite significantly declined.<ref name=\"SFDPH HIV Epi Report 2008\">{{cite web\n |title        = 2008 HIV/AIDS Epidemiology Annual Report\n |publisher    = San Francisco Department of Public Health\n |date         = July 9, 2009\n |url          = http://sfhiv.org/documents/AnnualReport2008.pdf\n |accessdate   = March 21, 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724191441/http://sfhiv.org/documents/AnnualReport2008.pdf\n |archive-date = July 24, 2011\n |url-status   = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nThe overall death rate among persons diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in New York City decreased by sixty-two percent from 2001 to 2012.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/dires/2013-hiv-surveillance-annual-report.pdf|title=HIV Surveillance Annual Report, 2013|last=|first=|publisher=New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Containment ==\nAfter the HIV/AIDS outbreak in the 1980s, various responses emerged in an effort to alleviate the issue.

[[David Ho (scientist)|David Ho]], a pioneer of this approach, was honored as ''[[Time Magazine]]'' Man of the Year for 1996.

Under legislation enacted by the [[United States Congress]] in 1993, patients found importing anti-HIV medication into the country were arrested and placed on flights back to their country of origin<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/history/hiv-and-aids-timeline|title=A Timeline of HIV and AIDS|date=2016-05-11|website=HIV.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\nSome HIV-positive travelers took to sending anti-HIV medication through the post to friends or contacts in advocacy groups in advance. This meant that the traveller would not be discovered with any medication. However, the security clampdown following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 meant this was no longer an option.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe only legal alternative to this{{Clarify|date=March 2016}} was to apply for a special [[Visa (document)|visa]] beforehand, which entailed an interview at an American Embassy, confiscation of the passport during the lengthy application process, and then, if permission were granted, a permanent attachment being made to the applicant's passport.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThis process was condemned as intrusive and invasive by a number of advocacy groups, on the grounds that any time the passport was later used for travel elsewhere or for identification purposes, the holder's HIV status would become known. It was also felt that this rule was unfair because it applied even if the traveler was covered for HIV-related conditions under their own travel [[insurance]].\n\nIn early December 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] indicated that he would issue an executive order allowing HIV-positive people to enter the [[United States]] on standard visas. It was unclear whether applicants would still have to declare their HIV status.<ref name=\"Russell2006\">{{Cite news\n  | last = Russell | first = Sabin\n  | title = Bush to ease rule limiting HIV-positive foreign visitors\n  | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle\n  | publisher = Hearst Communications\n  | date = December 2, 2006\n  | url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-12-02/news/17323943_1_hiv-positive-world-aids-day-international-aids-conferences\n  | accessdate = March 21, 2010}}</ref> However, the ban remained in effect throughout Bush's Presidency. In August 2007, Congresswoman [[Barbara Lee]] of California introduced {{USBill|110|h|3337}}, the HIV Nondiscrimination in Travel and Immigration Act of 2007.

However, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] still held the ban in administrative (written regulation) law. New impetus was added to repeal efforts when Paul Thorn, a UK tuberculosis expert who was invited to speak at the 2009 [[Pacific Health Summit]] in Seattle, was denied a visa due to his HIV positive status.

In 1987, President Reagan created a Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic. This commission was recruited to investigate what steps are necessary for responding to the HIV outbreak, and the consensus was to establish more HIV testing, focus on prevention and treatment as well as expanding HIV care throughout the U.S.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Yehia|first=Baligh|last2=Frank|first2=Ian|date=2011|title=Battling AIDS in America: An Evaluation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=101|issue=9|pages=e4\u2013e8|doi=10.2105/ajph.2011.300259|pmid=21778507|pmc=3154226|issn=0090-0036}}</ref> However, these changes were not implemented during this time, and the commission recommendations were largely ignored.\n\nAnother attempt to respond to the HIV outbreak took place in 1996, when President Clinton established the National AIDS Strategy, which aimed to reduce number of infections, enhance research on HIV treatment, increase access to resources for people affected by AIDS, and also alleviate the racial disparities in HIV treatment and care.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Improving outcomes blueprint for a national AIDS plan for the United States.|last=Collins, Chris.|date=2007|publisher=Open Society Institute|oclc=1100047917}}</ref> Similarly to Reagan's plan, the National AIDS Strategy was not successfully enforced, providing only objectives without a specific action plan for implementation.\n\nIn 2010, President Obama created the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States (NHAS), with its three main objectives being to reduce the annual number of infections, reduce health disparities, and increase access to resources and HIV care.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, this new strategy differs in that it includes an Implementation Plan, with a timeline for achieving each of the three goals, as well as a document outlining the specific action plan that will be used.<ref>{{Cite book|title=National HIV/AIDS strategy : federal implementation plan.|last=United States.

Shilts contends that [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public health measures with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to infect hundreds of thousands more. This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] by [[Larry Kramer]]. Galvanized by the federal government's inactivity, the movement by AIDS activists to gain funding for AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last= Kahn Best\n|first= Rachel\n|title= Disease Politics and Medical Research Funding: Three Ways Advocacy Shapes Policy\n|journal= American Sociological Review\n|volume= 77\n|issue= 5\n|pages= 780\u2013803\n|doi= 10.1177/0003122412458509\n|year= 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Shilts work popularized the [[HIV and AIDS misconceptions|misconception]] that the disease was introduced by a gay [[flight attendant]] named [[Ga\u00ebtan Dugas]], referred to as \"[[Index case|Patient Zero]],\" although the author did not actually make this claim in the book. However, subsequent research has revealed that there were cases of AIDS much earlier than initially known. HIV-infected blood samples have been found from as early as 1959 in Africa ''(see [[HIV]] main entry)'', and HIV has been shown to have caused the death of [[Robert Rayford]], a 16-year-old St. Louis male, in 1969, who could have contracted it as early as 7 years old due to sexual abuse, suggesting that HIV had been present, at very low prevalence, in the U.S. since before the 1970s.\n\nAn early theory asserted that a series of [[inoculation]]s against [[hepatitis B]] that were performed in the gay community of [[San Francisco]] were tainted with HIV. Although there was a high correlation between recipients of that [[vaccination]] and initial cases of AIDS, this theory has long been discredited. HIV, [[hepatitis B]], and [[hepatitis C]] are bloodborne diseases with very similar modes of transmission, and those at risk for one are at risk for the others.<ref name=\"NIOSH Bloodborne\">{{Cite web\n  | title = Bloodborne Infectious Diseases HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B Virus, and Hepatitis C Virus\n  | publisher = US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\n  | date = March 10, 2010\n  | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/\n  | accessdate = March 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nActivists and critics of current AIDS policies allege that another preventable impediment to stemming the spread of the disease and/or finding a treatment was the vanity of \"celebrity\" scientists. [[Robert Gallo]], an American scientist involved in the search for a new [[virus]] in the people affected by the disease, became embroiled in a legal battle with French scientist [[Luc Montagnier]], who had first discovered such a virus in tissue cultures derived from a patient suffering from enlargement of the lymphnodes (an early sign of AIDS). Montagnier had named the new virus LAV (Lymphoadenopathy-Associated Virus).\n\nGallo, who appeared to question the primacy of the French scientist's discovery, refused to recognize the \"French virus\" as the cause of AIDS, and tried instead to claim the disease was caused by a new member of a retrovirus family, [[HTLV]], which he had discovered. Critics claim that because some scientists were more interested in trying to win a Nobel prize than in helping patients, research progress was delayed and more people needlessly died. After a number of meetings and high-level political intervention, the French scientists and Gallo agreed to \"share\" the discovery of HIV, although eventually Montagnier and his group were recognized as the true discoverers, and won the 2008 Nobel Prize for it.\n\nPublicity campaigns were started in attempts to counter the incorrect and often vitriolic perception of AIDS as a \"gay plague\". These included the [[Ryan White]] case, red ribbon campaigns, celebrity dinners, the [[And the Band Played On (film)|1993 film version]] of ''And the Band Played On'', [[AIDS education|sex education programs]] in schools, and [[Public service announcement|television advertisements]]. Announcements by various celebrities that they had contracted HIV (including actor [[Rock Hudson]], basketball star [[Magic Johnson]], tennis player [[Arthur Ashe]] and singer [[Freddie Mercury]]) were significant in arousing media attention and making the general public aware of the dangers of the disease to people of all sexual orientations.<ref>Small, Neil. \"Dying in a Public Place: AIDS Deaths.\" ''The Sociological Review'' 40, no. 1_suppl (May 1992): 87\u2013111.</ref>\n\n== Perspective of doctors ==\nAIDS was met with great fear and concern by the nation, much like any other epidemic, and those who were primarily affected were populations that the majority did not think highly of: homosexuals, African-Americans, Latinos, and intravenous drug users. The general thought of the population was to create distance and establish boundaries from these people, and some doctors were not immune from such impulses. During the epidemic, doctors began to not treat AIDS patients, not only to create distance from these groups of people, but also because they were afraid to contract the disease themselves. A surgeon in Milwaukee stated, \"I've got to be selfish. It's an incurable disease that's uniformly fatal, and I'm constantly at risk for getting it. I've got to think about myself. I've got to think about my family. That responsibility is greater than to the patient.\" <ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Aids Doctors Voices from the Epidemic|last=Bayer|first=Ronald|publisher=Oxford University|year=2000|isbn=0-19-512681-5|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/aidsdoctorsvoice00rona/page/4 4\u20135]|url=https://archive.org/details/aidsdoctorsvoice00rona/page/4}}</ref>\n\nSome doctors thought it was their duty to stay away from the virus because they had other patients to think of.

While the overall rates of HIV incidences and prevalence have decreased, they have increased in one particular demographic: African American gay and bisexual men (a 4% increase). In America, black households were reported to have the lowest median income, leading to lower rates of individuals with health insurance. This creates cost barriers to antiretroviral treatments. The racial disparities between women afflicted with HIV/AIDS have been made clear in a 2010 study as well, which showed that 64% of women infected with HIV that year were Black women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Riley J.|last2=Finocchario-Kessler|first2=Sarah|last3=Dariotis|first3=Jacinda K.|date=2013|title=Engaging HIV Care Providers in Conversations With Their Reproductive-Age Patients About Fertility Desires and Intentions: A Historical Review of the HIV Epidemic in the United States|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=103|issue=8|pages=1357\u20131366|doi=10.2105/ajph.2013.301265|pmid=23763424|pmc=4007857|issn=0090-0036}}</ref> This unequal distribution has led researchers to studying the long-term effects of racial and gender discrimination along with HIV-related stigma, and how this plays a role in people's lives.\n\n'''Hispanics/Latinos''' are also disproportionately affected by HIV.

African Americans have been experimented on and exploited for centuries. The Tuskegee Syphilis study experimented vulnerable men in the South who had syphilis.

Since the stigma circling homosexuality is that it is \"effeminate\", then homosexuality is seen as a threat to masculinity. \"Black manhood, then, depends on men's ability to be provider, progenitor, and protector. But, as the Black male performance of parts of this script is thwarted by economic and cultural factors, the performance of Black masculinity becomes predicated on a particular performance of Black sexuality and avoidance of weakness and femininity. If sexuality remains one of the few ways that Black men can recapture a masculinity withheld from them in the marketplace, endorsing Black homosexuality subverts the cultural project of reinscribing masculinity within the Black community.\" This critical view is influenced by Internalized homophobia. \"Internalized homophobia is defined as the lesbian, gay, or bisexual individual's inward direction of society's homophobic attitudes (Meyer 1995).\"<ref name=\"Hill 2013 475\u2013487\" />\n\nThe African American community's social norms regarding homosexuality have influenced a higher percentage of African Americans with internalized homophobia. This homophobic culture is sustained within the African American community through the church because religion is a vital part of the African American community: \"As reported by Peterson and Jones (2009), AA MSM tended to be more involved with religious communities than NHW MSM.\" Because the church reiterates this stigma of homosexuality, the African American community has higher rates of internalized homophobia. This internalized homophobia causes a lower chance of HIV/AIDS education on prevention and care within the African American community.<ref name=\"Hill 2013 475\u2013487\" />\n\nSex education varies throughout the United States and in some areas could use more informative measures. African-Americans and Hispanic/ Latinos experience higher rates of lower socioeconomic statuses and fewer opportunities than white people. This causes limited access to (higher) education in lower socioeconomic areas. Sex education on HIV prevention has decreased from 64% (2000) to 41% (2014). Out of the 50 states, 26 put a larger emphasis on abstinence sex education. Abstinence only sex education is correlated to increasing rates of HIV especially in teenagers and young adults.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/western-central-europe-north-america/usa|title=HIV and AIDS in the United States of America (USA)|date=2015-07-21|work=AVERT|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith mass incarceration of the African American community, HIV has been [[infectious diseases within American prisons|spreading rapidly throughout jails and prisons]]. \"Among jail populations, African American men are 5 times as likely as white men, and twice as likely as Hispanic/Latino men, to be diagnosed with HIV.\" Since most people contract HIV before being incarcerated, it is hard to know who has the disease and to keep it from spreading. A lack of hygiene in prisons perpetuates these problems. Many inmates do not disclose their high-risk behaviors, such as anal sex or injection drug use, because they fear being stigmatized and ostracized by other inmates. There is also a lack of educational programs on disease prevention for inmates. Because \"nine out of ten jail inmates are released in under 72 hours which makes it hard to test them for HIV and help them find treatment,\" the problem persists outside of prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebodypro.com/article/hiv-in-correctional-settings|title=HIV Among Incarcerated Populations in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Activism and response ==\nStarting in the early 1980s, AIDS activist groups and organizations began to emerge and advocate for people infected with HIV in the United States. Though it was an important aspect of the movement, activism went beyond the pursuit of funding for AIDS research. Groups acted to educate and raise awareness of the disease and its effects on different populations, even those thought to be at low-risk of contracting HIV. This was done through publications and \"alternative media\" created by those living with or close to the disease.<ref>{{Cite book|title=AIDS TV: Identity, Community, and Alternative Video|last=Juhasz|first=Alexandra|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-8223-1695-4|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to this \"alternative media\" created by activist groups, mass media reports on AIDS were not as prevalent, most likely due to the stigma surrounding the topic. The general public was therefore not exposed to information regarding the disease. In addition, the federal government and laws in place essentially prevented individuals afflicted with AIDS from getting sufficient information about the disease. Risk reduction education was not easily accessible, so activist groups took action in releasing information to the public through these publications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=HEREK|first=GREGORY M.|date=1999|title=AIDS and Stigma|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en-US|volume=42|issue=7|pages=1106\u20131116|doi=10.1177/0002764299042007004|issn=0002-7642|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2627cf2069a85bbd3ec607ae91cb6fd4d6c6b859}}</ref>\n\nActivist groups worked to prevent spread of HIV by distributing information about safe sex.

Other groups, like the [[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt|NAMES Project]], emerged as a way of memorializing those who had passed, refusing to let them be forgotten by the historical narrative. One group, the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT), headed by [[Yolanda Serrano]], coordinated with their local prison, [[Rikers Island Correctional Facility|Riker's Island Correctional Facility]], to advocate for those imprisoned and AIDS positive to be released early, so that they could pass away in the comfort of their own homes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-UCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=yolanda+serrano+and+adapt#v=onepage&q=yolanda%20serrano%20and%20adapt&f=false|title=ADAPT and Survive|last=Carter|first=Zoe|date=1988-05-09|magazine=New York Magazine|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBoth men and women, heterosexual and queer populations were active in establishing and maintaining these parts of the movement. Because AIDS was initially thought only to impact gay men, most narratives of activism focus on their contributions to the movement. However, women also played a significant role in raising awareness, rallying for change, and caring for those impacted by the disease. Lesbians helped organize and spread information about transmission between women, as well as supporting gay men in their work. Narratives of activism also tend to focus on organizing done in coastal cities, but AIDS activism was present and widespread across both urban and more rural areas of the United States. Organizers sought to address needs specific to their communities, whether that was working to establish [[Needle exchange programme|needle exchange programs]], fighting against housing or employment discrimination, or issues faced primarily by people identified as members of specific groups (such as sex workers, mothers and children, or incarcerated people).\n\nInitially when the AIDS epidemic surfaced in the United States, a large proportion of patients were LGBT community members, leading to stigmatization of the disease. Because of this, the AIDS activist groups took initiative in testing and experimenting with new possible medications for treating HIV, after researchers outside of the community refused. This research originally done by early activist groups contributed to treatments still being used today.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Street science : community knowledge and environmental health justice|last=Corburn, Jason.|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-03333-X|oclc=58830060}}</ref>\n\n=== Present day activism ===\nAn effective response to HIV/AIDS requires that groups of vulnerable populations have access to HIV prevention programs with information and services that are specific to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations|title=Key Affected Populations, HIV and AIDS|last=|first=|date=2015-07-24|website=Avert: Global Information and Education on HIV and AIDS|access-date=}}</ref> In the present day, some activist groups and AIDS organizations that were established during the height of the epidemic are still present and working to assist people living with AIDS.<ref name=\":0\" /> They may offer any combination of the following: health education, counseling and support, or advocacy for law and policy. AIDS organizations also continue to call for public awareness and support through participation in events like pride parades, [[World AIDS Day]], or [[AIDS Walk|AIDS walks]]. Newer activism has appeared in advocacy for [[Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis]] (PrEP), which has shown to significantly limit transmission of HIV.

This meant that the traveller would not be discovered with any medication. However, the security clampdown following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 meant this was no longer an option.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe only legal alternative to this{{Clarify|date=March 2016}} was to apply for a special [[Visa (document)|visa]] beforehand, which entailed an interview at an American Embassy, confiscation of the passport during the lengthy application process, and then, if permission were granted, a permanent attachment being made to the applicant's passport.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThis process was condemned as intrusive and invasive by a number of advocacy groups, on the grounds that any time the passport was later used for travel elsewhere or for identification purposes, the holder's HIV status would become known. It was also felt that this rule was unfair because it applied even if the traveler was covered for HIV-related conditions under their own travel [[insurance]].\n\nIn early December 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] indicated that he would issue an executive order allowing HIV-positive people to enter the [[United States]] on standard visas.

In 1987, President Reagan created a Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic.

Shilts contends that [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public health measures with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to infect hundreds of thousands more. This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] by [[Larry Kramer]]. Galvanized by the federal government's inactivity, the movement by AIDS activists to gain funding for AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last= Kahn Best\n|first= Rachel\n|title= Disease Politics and Medical Research Funding: Three Ways Advocacy Shapes Policy\n|journal= American Sociological Review\n|volume= 77\n|issue= 5\n|pages= 780\u2013803\n|doi= 10.1177/0003122412458509\n|year= 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Shilts work popularized the [[HIV and AIDS misconceptions|misconception]] that the disease was introduced by a gay [[flight attendant]] named [[Ga\u00ebtan Dugas]], referred to as \"[[Index case|Patient Zero]],\" although the author did not actually make this claim in the book. However, subsequent research has revealed that there were cases of AIDS much earlier than initially known. HIV-infected blood samples have been found from as early as 1959 in Africa ''(see [[HIV]] main entry)'', and HIV has been shown to have caused the death of [[Robert Rayford]], a 16-year-old St. Louis male, in 1969, who could have contracted it as early as 7 years old due to sexual abuse, suggesting that HIV had been present, at very low prevalence, in the U.S. since before the 1970s.\n\nAn early theory asserted that a series of [[inoculation]]s against [[hepatitis B]] that were performed in the gay community of [[San Francisco]] were tainted with HIV. Although there was a high correlation between recipients of that [[vaccination]] and initial cases of AIDS, this theory has long been discredited. HIV, [[hepatitis B]], and [[hepatitis C]] are bloodborne diseases with very similar modes of transmission, and those at risk for one are at risk for the others.<ref name=\"NIOSH Bloodborne\">{{Cite web\n  | title = Bloodborne Infectious Diseases HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B Virus, and Hepatitis C Virus\n  | publisher = US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\n  | date = March 10, 2010\n  | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/\n  | accessdate = March 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nActivists and critics of current AIDS policies allege that another preventable impediment to stemming the spread of the disease and/or finding a treatment was the vanity of \"celebrity\" scientists. [[Robert Gallo]], an American scientist involved in the search for a new [[virus]] in the people affected by the disease, became embroiled in a legal battle with French scientist [[Luc Montagnier]], who had first discovered such a virus in tissue cultures derived from a patient suffering from enlargement of the lymphnodes (an early sign of AIDS). Montagnier had named the new virus LAV (Lymphoadenopathy-Associated Virus).\n\nGallo, who appeared to question the primacy of the French scientist's discovery, refused to recognize the \"French virus\" as the cause of AIDS, and tried instead to claim the disease was caused by a new member of a retrovirus family, [[HTLV]], which he had discovered. Critics claim that because some scientists were more interested in trying to win a Nobel prize than in helping patients, research progress was delayed and more people needlessly died. After a number of meetings and high-level political intervention, the French scientists and Gallo agreed to \"share\" the discovery of HIV, although eventually Montagnier and his group were recognized as the true discoverers, and won the 2008 Nobel Prize for it.\n\nPublicity campaigns were started in attempts to counter the incorrect and often vitriolic perception of AIDS as a \"gay plague\". These included the [[Ryan White]] case, red ribbon campaigns, celebrity dinners, the [[And the Band Played On (film)|1993 film version]] of ''And the Band Played On'', [[AIDS education|sex education programs]] in schools, and [[Public service announcement|television advertisements]]. Announcements by various celebrities that they had contracted HIV (including actor [[Rock Hudson]], basketball star [[Magic Johnson]], tennis player [[Arthur Ashe]] and singer [[Freddie Mercury]]) were significant in arousing media attention and making the general public aware of the dangers of the disease to people of all sexual orientations.<ref>Small, Neil. \u201cDying in a Public Place: AIDS Deaths.\u201d ''The Sociological Review'' 40, no. 1_suppl (May 1992): 87\u2013111. </ref>\n\n== Perspective of doctors ==\nAIDS was met with great fear and concern by the nation, much like any other epidemic, and those who were primarily affected were populations that the majority did not think highly of: homosexuals, African-Americans, Latinos, and intravenous drug users. The general thought of the population was to create distance and establish boundaries from these people, and some doctors were not immune from such impulses. During the epidemic, doctors began to not treat AIDS patients, not only to create distance from these groups of people, but also because they were afraid to contract the disease themselves. A surgeon in Milwaukee stated, \"I've got to be selfish. It's an incurable disease that's uniformly fatal, and I'm constantly at risk for getting it. I've got to think about myself. I've got to think about my family.

But, as the Black male performance of parts of this script is thwarted by economic and cultural factors, the performance of Black masculinity becomes predicated on a particular performance of Black sexuality and avoidance of weakness and femininity. If sexuality remains one of the few ways that Black men can recapture a masculinity withheld from them in the marketplace, endorsing Black homosexuality subverts the cultural project of reinscribing masculinity within the Black community.\" This critical view is influenced by Internalized homophobia. \u201cInternalized homophobia is defined as the lesbian, gay, or bisexual individual's inward direction of society's homophobic attitudes (Meyer 1995).\"<ref name=\"Hill 2013 475\u2013487\" />\n\nThe African American community's social norms regarding homosexuality have influenced a higher percentage of African Americans with internalized homophobia. This homophobic culture is sustained within the African American community through the church because religion is a vital part of the African American community: \"As reported by Peterson and Jones (2009), AA MSM tended to be more involved with religious communities than NHW MSM.\" Because the church reiterates this stigma of homosexuality, the African American community has higher rates of internalized homophobia.

One group, the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT), headed by [[Yolanda Serrano]], coordinated with their local prison, [[Rikers Island Correctional Facility|Riker's Island Correctional Facility]], to advocate for those imprisoned and AIDS positive to be released early, so that they could pass away in the comfort of their own homes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-UCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=yolanda+serrano+and+adapt#v=onepage&q=yolanda%20serrano%20and%20adapt&f=false|title=ADAPT and Survive|last=Carter|first=Zoe|date=1988-05-09|publisher=New York Magazine|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBoth men and women, heterosexual and queer populations were active in establishing and maintaining these parts of the movement. Because AIDS was initially thought only to impact gay men, most narratives of activism focus on their contributions to the movement. However, women also played a significant role in raising awareness, rallying for change, and caring for those impacted by the disease. Lesbians helped organize and spread information about transmission between women, as well as supporting gay men in their work. Narratives of activism also tend to focus on organizing done in coastal cities, but AIDS activism was present and widespread across both urban and more rural areas of the United States. Organizers sought to address needs specific to their communities, whether that was working to establish [[Needle exchange programme|needle exchange programs]], fighting against housing or employment discrimination, or issues faced primarily by people identified as members of specific groups (such as sex workers, mothers and children, or incarcerated people).\n\nInitially when the AIDS epidemic surfaced in the United States, a large proportion of patients were LGBT community members, leading to stigmatization of the disease. Because of this, the AIDS activist groups took initiative in testing and experimenting with new possible medications for treating HIV, after researchers outside of the community refused. This research originally done by early activist groups contributed to treatments still being used today.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Street science : community knowledge and environmental health justice|last=Corburn, Jason.|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-03333-X|oclc=58830060}}</ref>\n\n=== Present day activism ===\nAn effective response to HIV/AIDS requires that groups of vulnerable populations have access to HIV prevention programs with information and services that are specific to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations|title=Key Affected Populations, HIV and AIDS|last=|first=|date=2015-07-24|website=Avert: Global Information and Education on HIV and AIDS|access-date=}}</ref> In the present day, some activist groups and AIDS organizations that were established during the height of the epidemic are still present and working to assist people living with AIDS.<ref name=\":0\" /> They may offer any combination of the following: health education, counseling and support, or advocacy for law and policy. AIDS organizations also continue to call for public awareness and support through participation in events like pride parades, [[World AIDS Day]], or [[AIDS Walk|AIDS walks]]. Newer activism has appeared in advocacy for [[Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis]] (PrEP), which has shown to significantly limit transmission of HIV. While PrEP appears to be extremely successful in suppressing the spread of HIV infection, there is some evidence that the reduction in HIV risk has led to some people taking more sexual risks, specifically, reduced use of condoms in anal sex.<ref>Holt M, Lea T, Mao L, Kolstee J, Zablotska I, Duck T, Allan B, West M, Lee E, Hull P, Grulich A, De Wit J, Prestage G (August 2018). \"Community-level changes in condom use and uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis by gay and bisexual men in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia: results of repeated behavioural surveillance in 2013-17\".

Because of the lack of HIV cases in that area beforehand and the youth of many but not all of those affected, the relative unavailability in the local area of safe needle exchange programs and of treatment centers capable of dealing with long-term health needs, HIV care, and drug addiction during the initial phases of the outbreak, it was not initially adequately contained and dealt with until those were set up by the government, and acute awareness of the issue spread. Such centers have now been opened, and short-term care is beginning to be provided; once the scope of the outbreak became clear, Governor [[Mike Pence]], despite some initial reservations, approved a legislative measure to allow safe, clean needle exchange programs and treatment for those affected, which could end up being instituted statewide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/04/24/402034996/hiv-outbreak-in-indiana-grows-with-nearly-140-confirmed-cases|title=HIV Outbreak In Indiana Grows With Nearly 140 Confirmed Cases|last1=Block |first1=Melissa |last2=Adams|first2=Jerome |date=April 24, 2015|publisher=NPR|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Criminal transmission of HIV in the United States]]\n* [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]]\n* [[AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs)]]\n* [[People With AIDS]] Self-Empowerment Movement\n* [[HIV/AIDS in New York City]]\n* [[Hank M.

The Synod sought to regulate some affairs of the Church in Ireland and to condemn some abuses, bringing the Church more into alignment with the [[Roman Rite]]. As such it can be seen as a continuation and part of the Irish church reform of the Twelfth Century, with the first synod of Cashel, the [[Synod of Rathbreasail]] and the [[Synod of Kells]], slowly embracing the [[Gregorian Reforms]]. The extent to which the Synod set the direction for the relationship between the English and the Irish Church has been the subject of scholarly debate. Stephen J.

This was the [[Episcopal see|see]] of [[Gilla Cr\u00edst Ua Connairche]] (Christianus), who was native [[papal legate]] to Ireland. Henry also visited Cashel and [[Dublin]], and thus had the opportunity to meet the [[archbishop]]s [[Donnchad Ua hUallach\u00e1in]] of Cashel and [[Lorc\u00e1n Ua Tuathail|Lawrence O'Toole]] of Dublin. According to Martin Holland, arrangements for a synod to meet at Cashel soon afterwards were put in place through these contacts.<ref name=\"Holland\" /> Giraldus lists these three bishops, as well as [[Cadla Ua Dubthaig]], [[Archbishop of Tuam]]<ref group=\"note\">named as \"Catholicus Tuotuenensis archiepisopi\" ([[#Expugnatio|Expugnatio, XXXIV]])</ref> among the clergy of Ireland attending the synod, \"with their suffragans and fellow-bishops, together with the abbots, archdeacons, priors, and deans, and many other Irish prelates\".<ref name=\"GeraldXXXIV\">[[#CoI|Giraldus, Conquest of Ireland]], Chapter XXXIV, pp.&nbsp;36&ndash;37</ref> [[Gilla Meic Liac mac Diarmata]] (Gelasius), [[Archbishop of Armagh]] and [[Primate of Ireland]], did not attend.

For the Latin text see [[#Expugnatio|]].</ref><ref>[[#Todd|Todd, chapter XII]]</ref>\n\nI That the faithful throughout Ireland do contract and observe lawful marriages rejecting those with their relations either by consanguinity or affinity.\n\nII That infants be catechised before the door of the church and baptised in the holy font in the baptismal churches.\n\nIII That all the faithful do pay the tithe of animals corn and other produce to the church of which they are parishioners.\n\nIV That all ecclesiastical lands and property connected with them be quite exempt from the exactions of all laymen. And especially that neither the petty kings nor counts nor any powerful men in Ireland nor their sons with their families do exact, as was usual, victuals and hospitality or entertainments in the ecclesiastical districts or presume to extort them by force and that the detestable food or contributions, which used to be required four times in the year from the farms belonging to churches by the neighbouring counts, shall not be claimed any more.\n\nV That in case of a murder committed by laymen and of their compounding for it with their enemies clergymen their relatives are not to pay part of the fine (or erick) but that as they were not concerned in the perpetration of the murder so they are to be exempted from the payment of money.\n\nVI That all the faithful lying in sickness do in the presence of their confessor and neighbours make their will with due solemnity dividing in case they have wives and children excepting their debts and servants wages their moveable goods into three parts and bequeathing one for the children and another for the lawful wife and the third for the funeral obsequies. And if haply they have no lawful progeny, let the goods be divided into two parts between himself and his wife. And if his lawful wife be dead, let them be divided between himself and his children.\n\nVII That to those who die with a good confession due respect be paid by means of masses and wakes and a decent burial. Likewise that all divine matters be henceforth conducted agreeably to the practices of the holy Church according as observed by the Anglican Church.\n\n==The seventh act==\nGiraldus lists these seven acts numbered as ''primo'', ''secundus'', etc. until ''septimus'', as related in Todd's translation above. The last part of the seventh act concerns the relationship between the Anglican and the Irish Church. According to Marie Therese Flanagan,<ref name=\"Flanagan77p57\">[[#Flanagan1977|Flanagan (1977)]], p. 57</ref> <blockquote>some historians have interpreted this as an actual decree of the synod, and have seen in it the origins of a policy of anglicisation of the Irish church pursued by the Angevin kings in Ireland. Thus, the synod of Cashel is often the starting point of any account of episcopal appointments in Ireland after the coming of the Normans and the extension of the electoral procedure of the English church to the Irish church is presumed to derive in principle from this decree.</blockquote> Flanagan, however, points out that, as it stands in Giraldus' account, this sentence refers only to the liturgical practices of the English church. She also questions whether this part is a part of the decrees of the synod, stating that \"it appears to be rather Gerald's own comment on what would be attempted by Irish churchmen.<ref name=\"Flanagan77p57\" /> Martin Holland does not include this part in his overview of the enacted decrees, but adds:<ref name=\"Holland\" /><blockquote>It was also decided that in Ireland, all matters relating to religion were to follow the observances of the English church. Some have interpreted this as referring to liturgical practices only; others see it as encompassing more, and therefore being much more fundamental, especially since it is claimed that the Irish bishops swore fealty to Henry at around this time.</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Synod of Rathbreasail]] ([[1111 in Ireland|1111]])\n* [[Synod of Kells]] ([[1152 in Ireland|1152]])\n* [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly]]\n\n==References and notes==\n\n===Notes===\n<references group=note/>\n\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=Cambrensis|first=Giraldus|title=Topographia hibernica, et Expugnatio hibernica|editor=[[James Francis Dimock]]|publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer|location=London|year=1867|volume=V|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjlXR8CVlpMC|accessdate=1 May 2010|ref=Expugnatio}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cambrensis|first=Giraldus|title=The Conquest of Ireland|editor=Thomas Forester and Thomas Wright|publisher=In parentheses Publications |location=Cambridge, Ontario|year=2001|url=http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/conquest_ireland.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2010|ref=CoI}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Flanagan|first=Marie Therese|year=1996|title=Henry II, the council of Cashel and the Irish bishops|journal=Peritia|publisher=Brepols Publishers|issn=0332-1592|url=http://brepols.metapress.com/content/26650x0366l3h939|ref=Flanagan1996|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128193643/http://brepols.metapress.com/content/26650x0366l3h939|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Flanagan|first=Marie Therese|year=1977|title=Hiberno-Papal relations in the late twelfth century|journal=Archivum Hibernicum|volume=34|pages=&nbsp;55&ndash;70|jstor=25487421|ref=Flanagan1977}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Holland|first=Martin|year=2005 |title=Cashel, synod of II (1172) |editor=Se\u00e1n Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland.

And especially that neither the petty kings nor counts nor any powerful men in Ireland nor their sons with their families do exact, as was usual, victuals and hospitality or entertainments in the ecclesiastical districts or presume to extort them by force and that the detestable food or contributions, which used to be required four times in the year from the farms belonging to churches by the neighbouring counts, shall not be claimed any more.\n\nV That in case of a murder committed by laymen and of their compounding for it with their enemies clergymen their relatives are not to pay part of the fine (or erick) but that as they were not concerned in the perpetration of the murder so they are to be exempted from the payment of money.\n\nVI That all the faithful lying in sickness do in the presence of their confessor and neighbours make their will with due solemnity dividing in case they have wives and children excepting their debts and servants wages their moveable goods into three parts and bequeathing one for the children and another for the lawful wife and the third for the funeral obsequies. And if haply they have no lawful progeny, let the goods be divided into two parts between himself and his wife. And if his lawful wife be dead, let them be divided between himself and his children.\n\nVII That to those who die with a good confession due respect be paid by means of masses and wakes and a decent burial. Likewise that all divine matters be henceforth conducted agreeably to the practices of the holy Church according as observed by the Anglican Church.\n\n==The seventh act==\nGiraldus lists these seven acts numbered as ''primo'', ''secundus'', etc. until ''septimus'', as related in Todd's translation above. The last part of the seventh act concerns the relationship between the Anglican and the Irish Church. According to Marie Therese Flanagan,<ref name=\"Flanagan77p57\">[[#Flanagan1977|Flanagan (1977)]], p. 57</ref> <blockquote>some historians have interpreted this as an actual decree of the synod, and have seen in it the origins of a policy of anglicisation of the Irish church pursued by the Angevin kings in Ireland. Thus, the synod of Cashel is often the starting point of any account of episcopal appointments in Ireland after the coming of the Normans and the extension of the electoral procedure of the English church to the Irish church is presumed to derive in principle from this decree.</blockquote> Flanagan, however, points out that, as it stands in Giraldus' account, this sentence refers only to the liturgical practices of the English church. She also questions whether this part is a part of the decrees of the synod, stating that \"it appears to be rather Gerald's own comment on what would be attempted by Irish churchmen.<ref name=\"Flanagan77p57\" /> Martin Holland does not include this part in his overview of the enacted decrees, but adds:<ref name=\"Holland\" /><blockquote>It was also decided that in Ireland, all matters relating to religion were to follow the observances of the English church. Some have interpreted this as referring to liturgical practices only; others see it as encompassing more, and therefore being much more fundamental, especially since it is claimed that the Irish bishops swore fealty to Henry at around this time.</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Synod of Rathbreasail]] ([[1118 in Ireland|1118]])\n* [[Synod of Kells]] ([[1152 in Ireland|1152]])\n* [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly]]\n\n==References and notes==\n\n===Notes===\n<references group=note/>\n\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=Cambrensis|first=Giraldus|title=Topographia hibernica, et Expugnatio hibernica|editor=[[James Francis Dimock]]|publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer|location=London|year=1867|volume=V|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjlXR8CVlpMC|accessdate=1 May 2010|ref=Expugnatio}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cambrensis|first=Giraldus|title=The Conquest of Ireland|editor=Thomas Forester and Thomas Wright|publisher=In parentheses Publications |location=Cambridge, Ontario|year=2001|url=http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/conquest_ireland.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2010|ref=CoI}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Flanagan|first=Marie Therese|year=1996|title=Henry II, the council of Cashel and the Irish bishops|journal=Peritia|publisher=Brepols Publishers|issn=0332-1592|url=http://brepols.metapress.com/content/26650x0366l3h939|ref=Flanagan1996|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128193643/http://brepols.metapress.com/content/26650x0366l3h939|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Flanagan|first=Marie Therese|year=1977|title=Hiberno-Papal relations in the late twelfth century|journal=Archivum Hibernicum|volume=34|pages=&nbsp;55&ndash;70|jstor=25487421|ref=Flanagan1977}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Holland|first=Martin|year=2005 |title=Cashel, synod of II (1172) |editor=Se\u00e1n Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland.

Born to a poor family in [[Vilna]] and orphaned at a young age, Kaczerginski was educated at the local [[Talmud Torah]] and night school, where he became involved in communist politics and was regularly beaten or imprisoned.\n\nAt the age of 15 he began publishing original songs and poetry, including ''[[Tates, mames, kinderlekh]]'' (\"Fathers, mothers, children\"), and soon began organising ''Yung Vilne'', a secular Jewish writing collective whose other members included [[Abraham Sutzkever]] and [[Chaim Grade]]. The Nazi invasion of Poland led to Kaczerginski's eventual imprisonment in the Vilna Ghetto, where he helped hide Jewish cultural works with Sutzkever as part of the [[Paper Brigade]] and joined the [[Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye|United Partisans Organisation]], participating in the failed Vilna Ghetto uprising and then escaping to the forest to fight with both the partisans and the Soviets.\n\nAfter the recapture of Vilna, Kaczerginski returned home to recover the hidden cultural works and founded the first post-Holocaust Jewish museum in Europe; he quickly became disenchanted with the Soviets and communism and developed into an ardent Zionist. After some time in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, he moved to Paris before eventually relocating to [[Buenos Aires]], where he was killed in a plane crash at the age of 45.\n\nRenowned during his lifetime as a poet and writer, Kaczerginski dedicated much of his time after the start of the Second World War to collecting pre-war [[Yiddish]] songs and songs of the Holocaust in order to save ''[[Yiddishkeit]]'' from destruction. The author, editor or publisher of most of the first post-Holocaust songbooks, Kaczerginski was responsible for preserving over 250 Holocaust songs \u2013 the majority of those still known. Despite the enduring popularity of many of his own works, and the importance of his labours to researchers and Yiddish cultural activists, his early death has led to his relative anonymity.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Abraham Sutzkever 1950.jpg|thumb|left|Abraham Sutzkever, with whom Kaczerginski collaborated from his time in ''Yung Vilne'' until his death, in 1950]]\nKaczerginski was born on 28 October 1908 in [[Vilna]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], to Volf and Alte Kaczerginski. Both of his parents died in early 1914, leaving Kaczerginski and his younger brother Yankl in the care of their grandfather. He was sent to the [[Talmud Torah]] for his education, where he was \"a good scholar and even better comrade\", becoming a member of the local communist party. After graduating he enrolled in night school and supported himself by working for a [[Lithography|lithographer]] named Hirsh Ayzenshtat \u2013 work which enabled him to write and cheaply print various publications for the communists.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=9}}\n\nAs a consequence of his political radicalism, Kaczerginski was regularly beaten by police and often imprisoned in [[Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison]], where he organised a drama club for other inmates.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=10}} This radicalism also led him to write his earliest known songs, including ''[[Tates, mames, kinderlekh]]'' (\"Fathers, mothers, children\"), a renowned Jewish socialist song written when he was 15 years old.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=11}}\n\nA year later he joined ''Yung Vilne'', a Jewish writing collective whose other members included [[Abraham Sutzkever]] and [[Chaim Grade]]. Kaczerginski was responsible for organisational work and editing, along with writing \"animated, sometimes incendiary verses\" that were extremely popular with the group's audience. In parallel, he worked for the Yiddish-language newspaper ''[[Morgen Freiheit]]'' and the Soviet organisation [[Agroid]].{{sfn|Werb|2014|pp=13-14}}\n\n==Second World War==\nAfter the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], Kaczerginski moved to [[Bia\u0142ystok]] in order to volunteer for the [[Red Army]], returning to Vilna in June 1940. Working with various Jewish writers organisations, his initial enthusiasm for the Soviet cause was soured by the shutting or censoring of many newspapers and publishing organisations, along with the arrest of [[Zalman Reisen]] and other members of the Yiddish community. Following [[Operation Barbarossa]] Vilna was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] and the local Jewish community shot or rounded up and sent to camps or ghettos. Kaczerginski managed to avoid capture until 1942 by posing as a [[deaf]] and [[Muteness|mute]] beggar.{{sfn|Werb|2014|pp=17-18}}\n\nFinally identified as Jewish, Kaczerginski was sent to the [[Vilna Ghetto]], where he married Barbara Kaufman and returned to writing in order to improve morale for the inmates. Works produced during this time included ''[[Friling]]'' (\"Springtime\"), about his wife's death in April 1943, ''[[Shtiler, shtiler]]'' (\"Quiet, Quiet\") and ''[[Yugnt himn]]'' (\"Hymn of Youth\").{{sfn|Werb|2014|pp=18-19}} When representatives of the ''[[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]]'' (ERR)\u2014the Nazi organisation tasked with stealing or destroying Jewish cultural property\u2014dictated that the Jewish literary archives in Vilna be categorised and burnt, Kaczerginski was one of the Ghetto residents forced to help them. Along with other labourers working on the project, including [[Zelig Kalmanovich]] and [[Abraham Sutzkever]],{{sfn|Kuznitz|2014|p=182}} he formed the [[Paper Brigade]], which instead smuggled thousands of works past the Nazi guards and hid them in various caches in and around the Ghetto for retrieval after the war.{{sfn|Fishman|2016|p=165}}\n\nHaving joined the [[Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye]] (United Partisans Organisation), Kaczerginski fought in the failed Vilna Ghetto uprising and escaped with the survivors to the surrounding forests. Working along Sutzkever as the historian of the FPO's Vitnberg Brigade, he translated many Soviet fighting songs into Yiddish and during his service with a Soviet unit wrote the \"uncharacteristically grisly-worded\" ''[[Partizaner-Marsh]]'' (\"Partisan's March\"), ''[[Yid, du Partizaner]]'' (\"The Jewish Partisan\") and \"Varshe\" (Warsaw) to commemorate the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]].{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=22}}\n\n==Vilna, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Paris==\n[[File:\u0160. Ka\u010derginskis \u017eyd\u0173 muziejuje prie i\u0161gelb\u0117t\u0173 i\u0161 Vilniaus geto knyg\u0173.jpeg|thumb|Kaczerginski with books saved by the [[Paper Brigade]]]]\nParticipating in the [[Vilnius Offensive|recapture of Vilna]], Kaczerginski returned with Sutzkever, [[Abba Kovner]] and other FPO survivors to go about rebuilding Jewish culture and digging up the hidden Paper Brigade caches. He founded the Vilna Museum of Jewish Art and Culture, later known as the Vilna Jewish Museum,{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=23}} the first post-Holocaust Jewish museum in Europe, with some of the recovered materials. Although the Museum was theoretically supported by Lithuanian and Soviet authorities, they provided few resources, assigning the organisers no budget and only giving them a burnt out former Ghetto building as a headquarters. Following the end of the war in 1945, it became clear that the volunteers' work was incompatible with the priorities of Soviet authorities, who burnt 30 tons of cache materials and, having demanded that any publicly displayed books be reviewed by a censor, simply refused to return any that were submitted.{{sfn|Fishman|1996}}\n\nAccordingly, Kaczerginski and others prepared to smuggle the collection yet again\u2014this time to the United States.{{sfn|Kuznitz|2014|p=183}} Volunteers took the books across the border to Poland, enlisting the help of [[Bricha]] contacts to move them into non-Soviet Europe. From there much of the material went to New York, although some was retained by Sutzkever (who later gave his material to the [[National Library of Israel]]).{{sfn|Fishman|2016|p=171}}\n\nAfter departing Vilna (and experiencing extreme anti-semitism in Moscow), Kaczerginski moved to the largely-intact city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, where he was employed by the Central Jewish Historical Commission. Kaczerginski had begun working as a ''zamler'' (collector) of Jewish music in 1944, considering the partisan and ghetto songs to be \"the martyrs\u2019 last will and testament to future generations\" and worthy of preservation. Lacking formal musical training, Kaczerginski instead memorised each song, interviewing former comrades and other survivors, before having them transcribed by [[David Botwinik]].{{sfn|Fishman|2016|p=174}}\n\nUsing some of this material, he edited and published  ''[[Undzer gezang]]'', the first post-war Jewish songbook in Poland and the first songbook to explicitly include \"ghetto songs\".{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=25}} Having undergone a political transformation during the war and early Soviet occupation, he shifted from communism to an engagement with Zionism, writing ''[[Khalutsim lid]]'' (Pioneers' song) in 1946 and collaborating with the Zionist [[Gordoniya]] collective to help Jewish children in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. A year later he married Meri Szutan, a native of [[\u0160ven\u010dionys]].{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=27}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1946 [[Kielce pogrom]], vast numbers of Polish Jews left the country, including Kaczerginski, who settled in [[Paris]]. From there he toured 17 [[displaced persons camp]]s in November 1947, lecturing survivors of the Holocaust, gathering new songs, and stopping in [[Munich]] to record several pieces for the Jewish Historical Commission. During this time he also wrote several original works, including ''Undzer lid'' (''Our Song'') in tribute to [[Hirsh Glick]], and ''[[S\u2019vet geshen]]'' (''It Will Happen'') commemorating the British attack on the ''[[SS Exodus]]''.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=29}} His employment with the Parisian Jewish Culture Congress allowed him to visit the United States in 1948 to attend the World Jewish Cultural Conference, and he used the opportunity to take speaking engagements in 30 different cities before returning to Paris.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=29}}\n\nThe remainder of the 1940s saw a writing rate that was \"productive even by his own industrious standards\". 1947 saw the publication of a ghetto songbook (''[[Dos gezang fun vilner geto]]''), a social history of the destruction of Vilna (''[[Khurbn vilna]]'') and ''[[Partizaner geyen!]]'', or \"Partisans Advance!\", a memoir of his time in combat with the FPO. A year later he published another songbook, ''[[Lider fun di getos un]]'' and in 1949 the political tract ''[[Tsvishn hamer un serp]]'': \"Between Hammer and Sickle\". The late 1940s also saw the birth of his only daughter and child, Libele.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=30}}\n\n== Move to Argentina and death ==\nHaving visited Israel in 1950, Kaczerginski was excited by the possibility of moving there \u2013 but instead chose to take his family to [[Buenos Aires]], after a job offer from the Jewish Cultural Congress, and they sailed there in May 1950. Already famous as a result of both his lecturing and publication, Kaczerginski's arrival:\n\n{{blockquote|evoked powerful manifestations of affection and enthusiasm for the fighter and singer of Yiddish Vilna and for the indefatigable developer of a new Yiddish culture. [It] was a great occasion in the life of the Argentine community and thousands of people will long, long remember the grand reception honoring him and the overflowing halls during his first lectures, to which the audience listened with bated breath. Within a short time he had won the greatest affection of Argentine Jewry. His friends numbered in the hundreds, perhaps in the thousands.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=31}}}}\n\nLocal leftists vehemently opposed Kaczerginski due to his explicit conversion away from communism, and often disrupted his speaking engagements. Despite this he maintained a heavy pace of lecturing, songwriting and journalism, writing for the Israeli Labor Party newspaper ''Hador'' and publishing ''Ikh bin geven a partizan: di grine legende'' (\"I Was a Partisan: The Green Legend\"), a two-part memoir based on the journals he had maintained throughout the Second World War.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=32}} Working with [[Michl Gelbart]] and [[Artur Rolnik]], he began work on another anthology of Yiddish songs, and in parallel wrote ''[[Zol shoyn kumen di geule]]'' (\"Let Salvation Come\"). Set to music by [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], the song is considered \"one of its author\u2019s most enduring works\".{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=33}}\n\nIn 1954 during the festival of [[Passover]], Kaczerginski found himself lecturing in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]; after local anti-communists swore to boycott his lecture, he extended his time there for an extra day, speaking to hundreds about his experience as a Ghetto fighter. Wanting to see his family again, he decided to travel by plane rather than the longer train route, and was on the flight to Buenos Aires from Mendoza on 23 April 1954, when it crashed shortly after takeoff, killing everyone on board (see also [[Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas accidents and incidents]]).{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=35}}\n\n==Legacy==\nKaczerginski's sudden death shocked the Yiddish-speaking world; to [[Chaim Grade]], his loss marked \"the inescapable end of the Old World Yiddish cultural community, already decimated and dispersed\".{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=35}} Sutzkever, having heard of the accident in Tel Aviv, simply telegrammed the Kaczerginski family \"mir viln nit gleybn nito kayn werter\": \"we will not believe, there are no words\".

The Nazi invasion of Poland led to Kaczerginski's eventual imprisonment in the Vilna Ghetto, where he helped hide Jewish cultural works with Sutzkever as part of the [[Paper Brigade]] and joined the [[Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye|United Partisans Organisation]], participating in the failed Vilna Ghetto uprising and then escaping to the forest to fight with both the partisans and the Soviets.\n\nAfter the recapture of Vilna, Kaczerginski returned home to recover the hidden cultural works and founded the first post-Holocaust Jewish museum in Europe; he quickly became disenchanted with the Soviets and communism and developed into an ardent Zionist. After some time in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, he moved to Paris before eventually relocating to [[Buenos Aires]], where he was killed in a plane crash at the age of 45.\n\nRenowned during his lifetime as a poet and writer, Kaczerginski dedicated much of his time after the start of the Second World War to collecting pre-war [[Yiddish]] songs and songs of the Holocaust in order to save ''[[Yiddishkeit]]'' from destruction. The author, editor or publisher of most of the first post-Holocaust songbooks, Kaczerginski was responsible for preserving over 250 Holocaust songs \u2013 the majority of those still known. Despite the enduring popularity of many of his own works, and the importance of his labours to researchers and Yiddish cultural activists, his early death has led to his relative anonymity.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Abraham Sutzkever 1950.jpg|thumb|left|Abraham Sutzkever, with whom Kaczerginski collaborated from his time in ''Yung Vilne'' until his death, in 1950]]\nKaczerginski was born on 28 October 1908 in [[Vilna]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], to Volf and Alte Kaczerginski. Both of his parents died in early 1914, leaving Kaczerginski and his younger brother Yankl in the care of their grandfather. He was sent to the [[Talmud Torah]] for his education, where he was \"a good scholar and even better comrade\", becoming a member of the local communist party. After graduating he enrolled in night school and supported himself by working for a [[Lithography|lithographer]] named Hirsh Ayzenshtat \u2013 work which enabled him to write and cheaply print various publications for the communists.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=9}}\n\nAs a consequence of his political radicalism, Kaczerginski was regularly beaten by police and often imprisoned in [[Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison]], where he organised a drama club for other inmates.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=10}} This radicalism also led him to write his earliest known songs, including ''[[Tates, mames, kinderlekh]]'' (\"Fathers, mothers, children\"), a renowned Jewish socialist song written when he was 15 years old.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=11}}\n\nA year later he joined ''Yung Vilne'', a Jewish writing collective whose other members included [[Abraham Sutzkever]] and [[Chaim Grade]]. Kaczerginski was responsible for organisational work and editing, along with writing \"animated, sometimes incendiary verses\" that were extremely popular with the group's audience. In parallel, he worked for the Yiddish-language newspaper ''[[Morgen Freiheit]]'' and the Soviet organisation [[Agroid]].{{sfn|Werb|2014|pp=13-14}}\n\n==Second World War==\nAfter the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], Kaczerginski moved to [[Bia\u0142ystok]] in order to volunteer for the [[Red Army]], returning to Vilna in June 1940. Working with various Jewish writers organisations, his initial enthusiasm for the Soviet cause was soured by the shutting or censoring of many newspapers and publishing organisations, along with the arrest of [[Zalman Reisen]] and other members of the Yiddish community. Following [[Operation Barbarossa]] Vilna was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] and the local Jewish community shot or rounded up and sent to camps or ghettos. Kaczerginski managed to avoid capture until 1942 by posing as a [[deaf]] and [[Muteness|mute]] beggar.{{sfn|Werb|2014|pp=17-18}}\n\nFinally identified as Jewish, Kaczerginski was sent to the [[Vilna Ghetto]], where he married Barbara Kaufman and returned to writing in order to improve morale for the inmates. Works produced during this time included ''[[Friling]]'' (\"Springtime\"), about his wife's death in April 1943, ''[[Shtiler, shtiler]]'' (\"Quiet, Quiet\") and ''[[Yugnt himn]]'' (\"Hymn of Youth\").{{sfn|Werb|2014|pp=18-19}} When representatives of the ''[[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]]'' (ERR)\u2014the Nazi organisation tasked with stealing or destroying Jewish cultural property\u2014dictated that the Jewish literary archives in Vilna be categorised and burnt, Kaczerginski was one of the Ghetto residents forced to help them. Along with other labourers working on the project, including [[Zelig Kalmanovich]] and [[Abraham Sutzkever]],{{sfn|Kuznitz|2014|p=182}} he formed the [[Paper Brigade]], which instead smuggled thousands of works past the Nazi guards and hid them in various caches in and around the Ghetto for retrieval after the war.{{sfn|Fishman|2016|p=165}}\n\nHaving joined the [[Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye]] (United Partisans Organisation), Kaczerginski fought in the failed Vilna Ghetto uprising and escaped with the survivors to the surrounding forests. Working along Sutzkever as the historian of the FPO's Vitnberg Brigade, he translated many Soviet fighting songs into Yiddish and during his service with a Soviet unit wrote the \"uncharacteristically grisly-worded\" ''[[Partizaner-Marsh]]'' (\"Partisan's March\"), ''[[Yid, du Partizaner]]'' (\"The Jewish Partisan\") and \"Varshe\" (Warsaw) to commemorate the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]].{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=22}}\n\n==Vilna, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Paris==\n[[File:\u0160. Ka\u010derginskis \u017eyd\u0173 muziejuje prie i\u0161gelb\u0117t\u0173 i\u0161 Vilniaus geto knyg\u0173.jpeg|thumb|Kaczerginski with books saved by the [[Paper Brigade]]]]\nParticipating in the [[Vilnius Offensive|recapture of Vilna]], Kaczerginski returned with Sutzkever, [[Abba Kovner]] and other FPO survivors to go about rebuilding Jewish culture and digging up the hidden Paper Brigade caches. He founded the Vilna Museum of Jewish Art and Culture, later known as the Vilna Jewish Museum,{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=23}} the first post-Holocaust Jewish museum in Europe, with some of the recovered materials. Although the Museum was theoretically supported by Lithuanian and Soviet authorities, they provided few resources, assigning the organisers no budget and only giving them a burnt out former Ghetto building as a headquarters. Following the end of the war in 1945, it became clear that the volunteers' work was incompatible with the priorities of Soviet authorities, who burnt 30 tons of cache materials and, having demanded that any publicly displayed books be reviewed by a censor, simply refused to return any that were submitted.{{sfn|Fishman|1996}}\n\nAccordingly, Kaczerginski and others prepared to smuggle the collection yet again\u2014this time to the United States.{{sfn|Kuznitz|2014|p=183}} Volunteers took the books across the border to Poland, enlisting the help of [[Bricha]] contacts to move them into non-Soviet Europe. From there much of the material went to New York, although some was retained by Sutzkever (who later gave his material to the [[National Library of Israel]]).{{sfn|Fishman|2016|p=171}}\n\nAfter departing Vilna (and experiencing extreme anti-semitism in Moscow), Kaczerginski moved to the largely-intact city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, where he was employed by the Central Jewish Historical Commission. Kaczerginski had begun working as a ''zamler'' (collector) of Jewish music in 1944, considering the partisan and ghetto songs to be \"the martyrs\u2019 last will and testament to future generations\" and worthy of preservation. Lacking formal musical training, Kaczerginski instead memorised each song, interviewing former comrades and other survivors, before having them transcribed by [[David Botwinik]].{{sfn|Fishman|2016|p=174}}\n\nUsing some of this material, he edited and published  ''[[Undzer gezang]]'', the first post-war Jewish songbook in Poland and the first songbook to explicitly include \"ghetto songs\".{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=25}} Having undergone a political transformation during the war and early Soviet occupation, he shifted from communism to an engagement with Zionism, writing ''[[Khalutsim lid]]'' (Pioneers' song) in 1946 and collaborating with the Zionist [[Gordoniya]] collective to help Jewish children in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. A year later he married Meri Szutan, a native of [[\u0160ven\u010dionys]].{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=27}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1946 [[Kielce pogrom]], vast numbers of Polish Jews left the country, including Kaczerginski, who settled in [[Paris]]. From there he toured 17 [[displaced persons camp]]s in November 1947, lecturing survivors of the Holocaust, gathering new songs, and stopping in [[Munich]] to record several pieces for the Jewish Historical Commission. During this time he also wrote several original works, including ''Undzer lid'' (''Our Song'') in tribute to [[Hirsh Glick]], and ''[[S\u2019vet geshen]]'' (''It Will Happen'') commemorating the British attack on the ''[[SS Exodus]]''.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=29}} His employment with the Parisian Jewish Culture Congress allowed him to visit the United States in 1948 to attend the World Jewish Cultural Conference, and he used the opportunity to take speaking engagements in 30 different cities before returning to Paris.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=29}}\n\nThe remainder of the 1940s saw a writing rate that was \"productive even by his own industrious standards\". 1947 saw the publication of a ghetto songbook (''[[Dos gezang fun vilner geto]]''), a social history of the destruction of Vilna (''[[Khurbn vilna]]'') and ''[[Partizaner geyen!]]'', or \"Partisans Advance!\", a memoir of his time in combat with the FPO. A year later he published another songbook, ''[[Lider fun di getos un]]'' and in 1949 the political tract ''[[Tsvishn hamer un serp]]'': \"Between Hammer and Sickle\". The late 1940s also saw the birth of his only daughter and child, Libele.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=30}}\n\n== Move to Argentina and death ==\nHaving visited Israel in 1950, Kaczerginski was excited by the possibility of moving there \u2013 but instead chose to take his family to [[Buenos Aires]], after a job offer from the Jewish Cultural Congress, and they sailed there in May 1950. Already famous as a result of both his lecturing and publication, Kaczerginski's arrival:\n\n{{blockquote|evoked powerful manifestations of affection and enthusiasm for the fighter and singer of Yiddish Vilna and for the indefatigable developer of a new Yiddish culture. [It] was a great occasion in the life of the Argentine community and thousands of people will long, long remember the grand reception honoring him and the overflowing halls during his first lectures, to which the audience listened with bated breath. Within a short time he had won the greatest affection of Argentine Jewry. His friends numbered in the hundreds, perhaps in the thousands.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=31}}}}\n\nLocal leftists vehemently opposed Kaczerginski due to his explicit conversion away from communism, and often disrupted his speaking engagements. Despite this he maintained a heavy pace of lecturing, songwriting and journalism, writing for the Israeli Labor Party newspaper ''Hador'' and publishing ''Ikh bin geven a partizan: di grine legende'' (\"I Was a Partisan: The Green Legend\"), a two-part memoir based on the journals he had maintained throughout the Second World War.{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=32}} Working with [[Michl Gelbart]] and [[Artur Rolnik]], he began work on another anthology of Yiddish songs, and in parallel wrote ''[[Zol shoyn kumen di geule]]'' (\"Let Salvation Come\"). Set to music by [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], the song is considered \"one of its author\u2019s most enduring works\".{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=33}}\n\nIn 1954 during the festival of [[Passover]], Kaczerginski found himself lecturing in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]; after local anti-communists swore to boycott his lecture, he extended his time there for an extra day, speaking to hundreds about his experience as a Ghetto fighter. Wanting to see his family again, he decided to travel by plane rather than the longer train route, and was on the flight to Buenos Aires from Mendoza on 23 April 1954, when it crashed shortly after takeoff, killing everyone on board (see also [[Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas accidents and incidents]]).{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=35}}\n\n==Legacy==\nKaczerginski's sudden death shocked the Yiddish-speaking world; to [[Chaim Grade]], his loss marked \"the inescapable end of the Old World Yiddish cultural community, already decimated and dispersed\".{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=35}} Sutzkever, having heard of the accident in Tel Aviv, simply telegrammed the Kaczerginski family \"mir viln nit gleybn nito kayn werter\": \"we will not believe, there are no words\". Many years later Sutzkever wrote him a memorial poem, ''[[Mit shmerken, ven es brenen velder]]'' (\"With Shmerke, when forests are burning\").{{sfn|Werb|2014|p=36}}\n\nKaczerginski himself has become \"largely anonymous\", and is little known outside of Yiddish language circles despite the enduring popularity of many of his songs.{{sfn|Werb|2008|p=35}}{{sfn|Dawidowicz|2008|p=123}} Despite this, he is considered to have been tremendously influential: having collected over 250 Holocaust songs during his time as a partisan, poet and writer, his songbooks are the source of the majority of surviving pieces of the genre.{{sfn|Duhl|1999|p=119}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|17em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Dawidowicz|first1=Lucy S.|title=From that place and time : a memoir, 1938\u20131947|date=2008|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=0813543622|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Duhl|first1=Lisa|title=Rocking an empty cradle: A psychological study of Yiddish Holocaust lullabies|date=1999|publisher=[[California School of Professional Psychology]]|oclc=926122847|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news|last1=Fishman|first1=David|title=Those Daring Escapades of Vilna's 'Papir Brigade': How a Yiddish Poet and His Crew Rescued Judaica|work=Forward|publisher=[[Forward (magazine)|Forward]]|year=1996|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Fishman|first1=David E.|editor1-last=Veidlinger|editor1-first=Jeffrey|title=Going to the People: Jews and the Ethnographic Impulse|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780253019080|chapter=The Last \"Zamlers\": Avrom Sutzkever and Shmerke Kaczerginski in Vilna, 1944-1945}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Kuznitz|first1=Cecile Esther|title=YIVO and the making of modern Jewish culture: scholarship for the Yiddish nation|year=2014|isbn=9781107014206|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Werb|first1=Bret Charles|title=Yiddish songs of the Shoah : a source study based on the collections of Shmerke Kaczerginski|date=2014|publisher=UMI Dissertation Publishing|oclc=982299385|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kaczerginski, Shmerke}}\n[[Category:1908 births]]\n[[Category:1954 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Vilnius]]\n[[Category:People from Vilna Governorate]]\n[[Category:Imperial Russian Jews]]\n[[Category:Lithuanian Jews]]\n[[Category:Jewish poets]]\n[[Category:Yiddish-language writers]]\n[[Category:Yiddish-language poets]]\n[[Category:Holocaust survivors]]\n[[Category:Vilna Ghetto inmates]]\n[[Category:History of YIVO]]\n[[Category:20th-century poets]]\n[[Category:20th-century male writers]]\n[[Category:Soviet partisans]]\n[[Category:Jewish partisans]]\n[[Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1954]]\n", "name_user": "Uri Schreter", "label": "safe", "comment": "changing the naming of Kaczerginski and Sutzkever in the photo, to have Kaczerginski first - since it's his entry, and it fits better with LtR anyway.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmerke_Kaczerginski"}
