The town is situated at the eastern limit of Obicinele Bucovinei mountains, in Humorului Depression, at the confluence of [[Moldova River]] and [[Humor River (Moldova)|Humor River]]. The average altitude of the town is 470 meters. The [[European route E58]] and the [[Suceava]] - [[Vatra Dornei]] railway pass through the town. Suceava, the county capital, is located 34&nbsp;km away. The town of [[Frasin]] is located nearby Gura Humorului (only 7&nbsp;km away).\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the 1775 Austrian Bukovina census, its population comprised only about 60,000 spread over 10,422 square kilometers. In order to encourage the development of this sparsely-settled land, the authorities subsidized the immigration of colonists to Bukovina. With the end of the first wave of settlement, colonists were to continue arriving at their own expense. As a result of these policies, the census of 1910 showed that the population had risen to over 800,000. People of many different ethnic groups took part in this immigration, including [[Germans]], [[Rusyns]], [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Poles]], [[Romanians]], and [[Jews]].\n\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Austrian and Romanian census data and/or official estimates\n|1910 |5,308\n|1930 |6,042\n|1948 |4,573\n|1956 |7,216\n|1966 |9,081\n|1977 |13,235\n|1992 |16,629\n|2002 |15,656\n|2011 |12,729\n|2016 |17,047\n}}\n\nIn 1992, Gura Humorului had a population of about 17,000 inhabitants were living within the town limits.

During [[World War I]], Bukovina became a battlefield between Austria opposing [[Russia]]n and [[Romania]]n troops. Although the Russians were finally driven out in 1917, defeated Austria would cede the Bukovina province to Romania through the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] (1919).\n\n==Jewish history of Gura Humorului==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Romania}}\n\nNo Jews lived in Gura Humorului before 1835, when they were allowed to settle, joining other, already represented, ethnic groups (such as Germans from [[Bohemia]], mainly from the [[B\u00f6hmerwald]]: thirty families settled on the mountainous and densely forested lands nearby the town, establishing a quarter named ''Bori''). The Jewish community began to flourish in 1869, when they formed around a third of the town's population (880 people); the same year, a [[Beth midrash]] was established.\n\nA turning point in the town's history was the disastrous fire of May 11, 1899 which destroyed most of the town, more than 400 houses, including many Jewish businesses and homes. It was rebuilt with donations from the [[United States]] Jewish communities. The Jewish community in Gura Humorului continued to grow, reaching 1,951 members in 1927.\n\nJewish cultural life reached its peak in the inter-war period. The languages of choice in city life were Yiddish, German and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. Most of the Jewish community adhered to [[Orthodox Judaism]], and Jewish youngsters studied the [[Torah]] along with secular subjects such as geography, history, and mathematics. The community had established Jewish social and political institutions that contributed to all fields of public life.\n\nWhile persecutions began to increase under the threats posed by Romanian [[Fascism|fascist]] movements such as the [[Iron Guard]], it was [[World War II]] that brought an end to Jewish presence in Gura Humorului. Under the dictatorship of [[Ion Antonescu]], Jews were rounded up and deported to [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]], where most of them perished \u2013 mass murdered through various means, including shootings and [[criminal negligence]] (see [[Romania during World War II#Romania and the Holocaust|Holocaust in Romania]]). Virtually all of the Jewish community in Gura Humorului was deported: 2,945 people were all transported on October 10, 1941.\n\nThe vast majority of survivors [[Aliyah|migrated]] to [[Israel]] in 1947\u20131951. Statistics show that they numbered below 500 people in all at the time of their departure.\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\n* {{flagicon|France}} [[Marly-le-Roi]], [[France]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n* {{flagicon|Poland}} [[Puck, Poland]]<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.ziare.com/suceava/primar/orasul-gura-humorului-infratit-cu-localitatea-poloneza-puck-2252070| title=Ora\u0219ul Gura Humorului \u00eenfr\u0103\u021bit cu localitatea polonez\u0103 Puck| work=Ziare.com| accessdate = April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Sulina]], [[Romania]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.primaria-sulina.ro/generaleoras/hot184infratireGuraHumorului.pdf |title=Decision No 183 on 5 December 2006 by Sulina |access-date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401060459/https://www.primaria-sulina.ro/generaleoras/hot184infratireGuraHumorului.pdf|archive-date=1 April 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Natives==\n* [[Andreea Boghian]] - rower\n* [[Nathan Juran]] - American film director\n* [[Olha Kobylianska]] - Ukrainian-German writer\n* [[Viorel Lucaci]] - rugby player\n* [[Mihai Macovei]] - rugby player\n* [[Rixi Markus]] - [[Contract bridge|bridge]] player\n* [[Vlad Nistor]] - rugby player\n* [[Daniel Plai]] - rugby player\n* [[Victor S\u0103hleanu]] - physician and anthropologist\n* [[Dorin Semeghin]] - footballer\n* [[C\u0103t\u0103lin \u021a\u0103ranu]] - professional go player (5 Dan)\n* [[Salomon Wininger]] - biographer\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Gura Humorului 725300, Romania - panoramio (1).jpg|Panoramic view of the town\nFile:Primaria din Gura Humorului (1901)6.jpg|The Town Hall\nFile:Judecatoria Gura Humorului.jpg|The Town Court\nFile:Scoala nr. 1 din Gura Humorului.jpg|School No. 1\nFile:Scoala nr. 2 din Gura Humorului.jpg|School No. 2\nFile:Centrul ora\u0219ului Gura Humorului.jpg|Hotel Bucovina\nFile:Gura Humorului 725300, Romania - panoramio.jpg|Traditional Romanian wooden house\nFile:Olga Kobyleanska2.jpg|Olha Kobylianska Statue\nFile:Biserica romano-catolica din Gura Humorului10.jpg|The Roman Catholic Church\nFile:La catedral ortodoxa.jpg|The Orthodox Cathedral\nFile:Sinagoga Mare din Gura Humorului.jpg|The Synagogue\nFile:Voronet.jpg|[[Vorone\u021b Monastery]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Gura Humorului}}\n{{wikivoyage|Gura Humorului}}\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://www.primariagh.ro/ Gura Humorului Town Hall official site]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://www.gurahumorului.info/ Gura Humorului touristic site]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20180601104848/http://gurahumor.ro/ Gura Humorului unofficial site]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://www.tourismguide.ro/html/orase/Suceava/Gura%20Humorului/scurt_istoric.php Tourism Guide - Gura Humorului web page]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://judetulsuceava.ro/localitati/orase/gura-humorului/ Suceava County site - Gura Humorului web page]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20121112184450/http://picasaweb.google.com/EdwardTurJ/OldBukowinaPhotosGurahumora Photo Gallery - Old photos of Gura Humorului]\n* {{in lang|he}} [http://humora.tripod.com/ Gura Humorului Jewish Community]\n* {{in lang|he}} [http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/gura1/gur203.html Comprehensive lists of Gura Humorului Jews killed in 1941]\n\n{{Suceava County}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Romania]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Suceava County]]\n[[Category:Spa towns in Romania]]\n[[Category:Shtetls]]\n[[Category:Bukovina-German people]]\n[[Category:Jewish communities in Romania]]\n[[Category:Duchy of Bukovina]]\n[[Category:Localities in Southern Bukovina]]\n[[Category:Holocaust locations in Romania]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Romanian subdivision\n|type                   = town\n|county                 = Suceava\n|population_total       = auto\n|map_caption            = Location in Suceava County\n|official_name=Gura Humorului\n|image_shield=ROU SV Gura Humorului CoA.jpg\n|image_map              = Gura Humorului jud Suceava.png\n|image_skyline=File:Biserica romano-catolica din Gura Humorului2.jpg\n|image_caption=View from Gura Humorului's town center\n|leader_name=Marius Ioan Urs\u0103ciuc<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.2016bec.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SIAL2016_P_Lista_Moc-2.xlsx |title=Results of the 2016 local elections |publisher=Central Electoral Bureau |accessdate=2020-04-05 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|leader_party=Independent\n|area_total_km2=60.90\n|coordinates            = {{coord|47|33|14|N|25|53|21|E|region:RO|display=inline,title}}\n|website=[http://www.primariagh.ro/ Official site]\n}}\n\n'''Gura Humorului''' ({{IPA-ro|\u02cc\u0261ura hu\u02c8moruluj}};

The town is situated at the eastern limit of Obicinele Bucovinei mountains, in Humorului Depression, at the confluence of [[Moldova River]] and [[Humor River (Moldova)|Humor River]]. The average altitude of the town is 470 meters. The [[European route E58]] and the [[Suceava]] - [[Vatra Dornei]] railway pass through the town. Suceava, the county capital, is located 34&nbsp;km away. The town of [[Frasin]] is located nearby Gura Humorului (only 7&nbsp;km away).\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the 1775 Austrian Bukovina census, its population comprised only about 60,000 spread over 10,422 square kilometers. In order to encourage the development of this sparsely-settled land, the authorities subsidized the immigration of colonists to Bukovina. With the end of the first wave of settlement, colonists were to continue arriving at their own expense. As a result of these policies, the census of 1910 showed that the population had risen to over 800,000. People of many different ethnic groups took part in this immigration, including [[Germans]], [[Rusyns]], [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Poles]], [[Romanians]], and [[Jews]].\n\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Austrian and Romanian census data and/or official estimates\n|1910 |5,308\n|1930 |6,042\n|1948 |4,573\n|1956 |7,216\n|1966 |9,081\n|1977 |13,235\n|1992 |16,629\n|2002 |15,656\n|2011 |12,729\n|2016 |17,047\n}}\n\nIn 1992, Gura Humorului had a population of about 17,000 inhabitants were living within the town limits.

During [[World War I]], Bukovina became a battlefield between Austria opposing [[Russia]]n and [[Romania]]n troops. Although the Russians were finally driven out in 1917, defeated Austria would cede the Bukovina province to Romania through the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] (1919).\n\n==Jewish history of Gura Humorului==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Romania}}\n\nNo Jews lived in Gura Humorului before 1835, when they were allowed to settle, joining other, already represented, ethnic groups (such as Germans from [[Bohemia]], mainly from the [[B\u00f6hmerwald]]: thirty families settled on the mountainous and densely forested lands nearby the town, establishing a quarter named ''Bori''). The Jewish community began to flourish in 1869, when they formed around a third of the town's population (880 people); the same year, a [[Beth midrash]] was established.\n\nA turning point in the town's history was the disastrous fire of May 11, 1899 which destroyed most of the town, more than 400 houses, including many Jewish businesses and homes. It was rebuilt with donations from the [[United States]] Jewish communities. The Jewish community in Gura Humorului continued to grow, reaching 1,951 members in 1927.\n\nJewish cultural life reached its peak in the inter-war period. The languages of choice in city life were Yiddish, German and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. Most of the Jewish community adhered to [[Orthodox Judaism]], and Jewish youngsters studied the [[Torah]] along with secular subjects such as geography, history, and mathematics. The community had established Jewish social and political institutions that contributed to all fields of public life.\n\nWhile persecutions began to increase under the threats posed by Romanian [[Fascism|fascist]] movements such as the [[Iron Guard]], it was [[World War II]] that brought an end to Jewish presence in Gura Humorului. Under the dictatorship of [[Ion Antonescu]], Jews were rounded up and deported to [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]], where most of them perished \u2013 mass murdered through various means, including shootings and [[criminal negligence]] (see [[Romania during World War II#Romania and the Holocaust|Holocaust in Romania]]). Virtually all of the Jewish community in Gura Humorului was deported: 2,945 people were all transported on October 10, 1941.\n\nThe vast majority of survivors [[Aliyah|migrated]] to [[Israel]] in 1947\u20141951. Statistics show that they numbered below 500 people in all at the time of their departure.\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\n* {{flagicon|France}} [[Marly-le-Roi]], [[France]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n* {{flagicon|Poland}} [[Puck, Poland]]<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.ziare.com/suceava/primar/orasul-gura-humorului-infratit-cu-localitatea-poloneza-puck-2252070| title=Ora\u0219ul Gura Humorului \u00eenfr\u0103\u021bit cu localitatea polonez\u0103 Puck| work=Ziare.com| accessdate = April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Sulina]], [[Romania]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.primaria-sulina.ro/generaleoras/hot184infratireGuraHumorului.pdf |title=Decision No 183 on 5 December 2006 by Sulina |access-date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401060459/https://www.primaria-sulina.ro/generaleoras/hot184infratireGuraHumorului.pdf|archive-date=1 April 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Natives==\n* [[Andreea Boghian]] - rower\n* [[Nathan Juran]] - American film director\n* [[Olha Kobylianska]] - Ukrainian-German writer\n* [[Viorel Lucaci]] - rugby player\n* [[Mihai Macovei]] - rugby player\n* [[Rixi Markus]] - [[Contract bridge|bridge]] player\n* [[Vlad Nistor]] - rugby player\n* [[Daniel Plai]] - rugby player\n* [[Victor S\u0103hleanu]] - physician and anthropologist\n* [[Dorin Semeghin]] - footballer\n* [[C\u0103t\u0103lin \u021a\u0103ranu]] - professional go player (5 Dan)\n* [[Salomon Wininger]] - biographer\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Gura Humorului 725300, Romania - panoramio (1).jpg|Panoramic view of the town\nFile:Primaria din Gura Humorului (1901)6.jpg|The Town Hall\nFile:Judecatoria Gura Humorului.jpg|The Town Court\nFile:Scoala nr. 1 din Gura Humorului.jpg|School No. 1\nFile:Scoala nr. 2 din Gura Humorului.jpg|School No. 2\nFile:Centrul ora\u0219ului Gura Humorului.jpg|Hotel Bucovina\nFile:Gura Humorului 725300, Romania - panoramio.jpg|Traditional Romanian wooden house\nFile:Olga Kobyleanska2.jpg|Olha Kobylianska Statue\nFile:Biserica romano-catolica din Gura Humorului10.jpg|The Roman Catholic Church\nFile:La catedral ortodoxa.jpg|The Orthodox Cathedral\nFile:Sinagoga Mare din Gura Humorului.jpg|The Synagogue\nFile:Voronet.jpg|[[Vorone\u021b Monastery]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Gura Humorului}}\n{{wikivoyage|Gura Humorului}}\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://www.primariagh.ro/ Gura Humorului Town Hall official site]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://www.gurahumorului.info/ Gura Humorului touristic site]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20180601104848/http://gurahumor.ro/ Gura Humorului unofficial site]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://www.tourismguide.ro/html/orase/Suceava/Gura%20Humorului/scurt_istoric.php Tourism Guide - Gura Humorului web page]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://judetulsuceava.ro/localitati/orase/gura-humorului/ Suceava County site - Gura Humorului web page]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20121112184450/http://picasaweb.google.com/EdwardTurJ/OldBukowinaPhotosGurahumora Photo Gallery - Old photos of Gura Humorului]\n* {{in lang|he}} [http://humora.tripod.com/ Gura Humorului Jewish Community]\n* {{in lang|he}} [http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/gura1/gur203.html Comprehensive lists of Gura Humorului Jews killed in 1941]\n\n{{Suceava County}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Romania]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Suceava County]]\n[[Category:Spa towns in Romania]]\n[[Category:Shtetls]]\n[[Category:Bukovina-German people]]\n[[Category:Jewish communities in Romania]]\n[[Category:Duchy of Bukovina]]\n[[Category:Localities in Southern Bukovina]]\n[[Category:Holocaust locations in Romania]]\n", "name_user": "Rosenborg BK Fan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eJewish history of Gura Humorului:Updated section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gura_Humorului"}

The [[British colonization of Australia]] began in 1788, and waves of multi-ethnic migration followed. Evidence of a significant [[Anglo-Celtic]] heritage includes the predominance of the [[English language]], the existence of a [[democratic system]] of government drawing upon the British traditions of [[Westminster]] Government, Parliamentarianism and [[Monarchy of Australia|constitutional monarchy]], American [[constitutionalism|constitutionalist]] and [[federalism|federalist]] traditions, [[Christianity]] as the dominant religion, and the popularity of sports originating in (or influenced by) the British Isles.  Australian culture has diverged significantly since British settlement.\n\nAboriginal people are believed to have arrived as early as 60,000 years ago, and evidence of [[Aboriginal art]] in Australia dates back at least 30,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/Indigenous_peoples.html |title=About Australia: Indigenous peoples: an overview |publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] |accessdate=26 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122064834/http://dfat.gov.au/facts/Indigenous_peoples.html |archivedate=22 November 2010 }}</ref> Several [[States and Territories of Australia|states and territories]] had their origins as penal colonies, with the [[First Fleet|first British convicts]] arriving at [[Sydney Cove]] in 1788.

In the 1970s, satirical talk-show host [[Norman Gunston]] (played by Garry McDonald), with his [[malapropism]]s, sweep-over hair and poorly shaven face, rose to great popularity by pioneering the satirical \"ambush\" interview technique and giving unique interpretations of pop songs. [[Roy and HG]] provide an affectionate but irreverent parody of Australia's obsession with sport.\n\nThe unique character and humor of Australian culture was defined in cartoons by immigrants, [[Emile Mercier (cartoonist)|Emile Mercier]] and [[George Molnar]], and in the novel ''[[They're a Weird Mob]]'' (1957) by [[John O'Grady (writer)|John O'Grady]], which looks at Sydney through the eyes of an Italian immigrant.

A period of success for Australian musical theatre came in the 1990s with the debut of musical biographies of Australian music singers [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]] (''[[The Boy From Oz]]'' in 1998) and [[Johnny O'Keefe]] (''[[Shout!

Contemporary Australian architecture includes a number of other iconic structures, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbor Bridge]] in Sydney and [[Parliament House, Canberra]]. Significant architects who have worked in Australia include Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]'s colonial architect, [[Francis Greenway]]; the ecclesiastical architect [[William Wardell]]; the designer of Canberra's layout, [[Walter Burley Griffin]]; the modernist [[Harry Seidler]]; and [[J\u00f8rn Utzon]], designer of the Sydney Opera House. The [[National Trust of Australia]] is a non-governmental organisation charged with protecting Australia's built heritage.\n\nEvidence of permanent structures built by Indigenous Australians before European settlement of Australia in 1788 is limited. Much of what they built was temporary, and was used for housing and other needs. As a British colony, the first European buildings were derivative of the European fashions of the time. Tents and [[wattle and daub]] huts preceded more substantial structures. [[Georgian architecture]] is seen in early government buildings of Sydney and Tasmania and the homes of the wealthy. While the major Australian cities enjoyed the boom of the [[Victorian era]], the [[Australian gold rushes]] of the mid-19th century brought major construction works and exuberant [[Victorian architecture]] to the major cities, particularly Melbourne, and regional cities such as [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] and [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]]. Other significant architectural movements in Australian architecture include the [[Federation style]] at the turn of the 20th century, and the modern styles of the late 20th century which also saw many older buildings demolished. The [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] is the primarily residential style of warm climate architecture developed in Queensland and northern parts of New South Wales.\n\nReligious architecture is also prominent throughout Australia, with large [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] and [[Catholicism in Australia|Catholic]] cathedrals in every major city and Christian churches in most towns. Notable examples include [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]] and [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney]]. Other houses of worship are also common, reflecting the cultural diversity existing in Australia; the oldest Islamic structure in the Southern Hemisphere is the [[Central Adelaide Mosque]] (built in the 1880s),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://recollections.nma.gov.au/issues/vol_2_no2/notes_and_comments/australias_muslim_cameleer_heritage/ |title=reCollections \u2013 Australia's Muslim cameleer heritage |publisher=Recollections.nma.gov.au |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref> and one of the Southern Hemisphere's largest [[Buddhist Temple]]s is [[Wollongong]]'s [[Nan Tien Temple]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nantien.org.au/en/about/history.asp |title=Nan Tien Temple-History of Temple |publisher=Nantien.org.au |date=28 November 1991 |accessdate=29 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220170543/http://www.nantien.org.au/en/about/history.asp |archivedate=20 February 2011  }}</ref> Sydney's [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-style [[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Great Synagogue]] was consecrated in 1878.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/ |title=The Great Synagogue Sydney \u2013 Home |publisher=Greatsynagogue.org.au |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, [[Australian pubs]] have also been noted for often distinctive designs.\n\nSignificant concern was raised during the 1960s, with developers threatening the destruction of historical buildings, especially in Sydney. Heritage concerns led to union-initiated ''[[green ban]]s'', which saved significant examples of Australia's architectural past. Green bans helped to protect historic 18th-century buildings in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]] from being demolished to make way for office towers, and prevented the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]] from being turned into a car park for the Sydney Opera House.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mundey|first=Jack|title=Green bans and beyond|publisher=Angus and Robertson|location=Sydney|year=1981|isbn=0207143676}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:HydeParkBarracks.JPG|[[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]], Sydney\nFile:PortArthur main lowres.JPG|Convict architecture at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]], Tasmania\nFile:SaintMarys CathedralSydney.jpg|Interior of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney|St Mary's Cathedral]], Sydney\nFile:Royal exhibition building tulips straight.jpg|The [[Royal Exhibition Building]], Melbourne\nFile:Birdsville Hotel.jpg|[[Birdsville]] Hotel, an [[Australian pub]] in outback Queensland\nFile:Parliament House Canberra Dusk Panorama.jpg|[[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]], Canberra\nFile:15 Northcote Avenue, Killara, New South Wales (2011-06-15).jpg|[[Federation Bungalow]] in [[Killara, New South Wales|Killara]], Sydney\nFile:Queenslander East Brisbane 1a.jpg|A typical [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] house in Brisbane\n</gallery>\n\n===Visual arts===\n{{Main|Visual arts of Australia}}\n{{See also|Indigenous Australian art}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n | align     = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 170\n | image1    = Bradshaw rock paintings2.jpg\n | caption1  = [[Bradshaw rock art|Bradshaws]] in the [[Kimberley region]] of Western Australia\n | image2    = Sunbaker maxdupain nga76.54.jpg\n | caption2  = ''[[Sunbaker]]'' (1937), an iconic photograph by [[Max Dupain]]\n}}\nAboriginal [[rock art]] is the oldest continuous art tradition in the world, dating as far back as 60,000 years.

During the First World War, Australian soldiers were considered to be remarkably determined, united and hard-working. Many Australians knew how to ride and shoot prior to enlistment, making them talented recruits, but they were also infamous for their lax attitude towards formal parade ground discipline, a notoriety that the Australian soldiers reveled in. From this the notion of the larrikin [[Digger (soldier)|Digger]] emerged,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} an important part of contemporary Australian identity.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Attitudes, beliefs and stereotypes==\nCritics and scholars have sometimes scrutinized the Australian culture, with aspects of it loosely criticized for being [[kitsch]], low-brow or rooted in poor taste.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memory Fragments: Visualising Difference in Australian History|year=2012|publisher=Intellect Books|first=Marita|last=Bullock|page=17|isbn=9781841505534}}</ref> The term \"[[cultural cringe]]\" was coined to describe this entrenched national inferiority complex which assumes ideas and cultures of other places are automatically superior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/10/1974488.htm |title=Getting over Australia's Cultural Cringe |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=10 July 2007 |accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Arthur Angel | authorlink = A.

In the 1970s, satirical talk-show host [[Norman Gunston]] (played by Garry McDonald), with his [[malapropism]]s, sweep-over hair and poorly shaven face, rose to great popularity by pioneering the satirical \"ambush\" interview technique and giving unique interpretations of pop songs. [[Roy and HG]] provide an affectionate but irreverent parody of Australia's obsession with sport.\n\nThe unique character and humor of Australian culture was defined in cartoons by immigrants, [[Emile Mercier (cartoonist)|Emile Mercier]] and [[George Molnar]], and in the novel ''[[They're a Weird Mob]]'' (1957) by [[John O'Grady (writer)|John O'Grady]], which looks at Sydney through the eyes of an Italian immigrant.

Contemporary Australian architecture includes a number of other iconic structures, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbor Bridge]] in Sydney and [[Parliament House, Canberra]]. Significant architects who have worked in Australia include Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]'s colonial architect, [[Francis Greenway]]; the ecclesiastical architect [[William Wardell]]; the designer of Canberra's layout, [[Walter Burley Griffin]]; the modernist [[Harry Seidler]]; and [[J\u00f8rn Utzon]], designer of the Sydney Opera House. The [[National Trust of Australia]] is a non-governmental organisation charged with protecting Australia's built heritage.\n\nEvidence of permanent structures built by Indigenous Australians before European settlement of Australia in 1788 is limited. Much of what they built was temporary, and was used for housing and other needs. As a British colony, the first European buildings were derivative of the European fashions of the time. Tents and [[wattle and daub]] huts preceded more substantial structures. [[Georgian architecture]] is seen in early government buildings of Sydney and Tasmania and the homes of the wealthy. While the major Australian cities enjoyed the boom of the [[Victorian era]], the [[Australian gold rushes]] of the mid-19th century brought major construction works and exuberant [[Victorian architecture]] to the major cities, particularly Melbourne, and regional cities such as [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] and [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]]. Other significant architectural movements in Australian architecture include the [[Federation style]] at the turn of the 20th century, and the modern styles of the late 20th century which also saw many older buildings demolished. The [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] is the primarily residential style of warm climate architecture developed in Queensland and northern parts of New South Wales.\n\nReligious architecture is also prominent throughout Australia, with large [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] and [[Catholicism in Australia|Catholic]] cathedrals in every major city and Christian churches in most towns. Notable examples include [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]] and [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney]]. Other houses of worship are also common, reflecting the cultural diversity existing in Australia; the oldest Islamic structure in the Southern Hemisphere is the [[Central Adelaide Mosque]] (built in the 1880s),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://recollections.nma.gov.au/issues/vol_2_no2/notes_and_comments/australias_muslim_cameleer_heritage/ |title=reCollections \u2013 Australia's Muslim cameleer heritage |publisher=Recollections.nma.gov.au |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref> and one of the Southern Hemisphere's largest [[Buddhist Temple]]s is [[Wollongong]]'s [[Nan Tien Temple]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nantien.org.au/en/about/history.asp |title=Nan Tien Temple-History of Temple |publisher=Nantien.org.au |date=28 November 1991 |accessdate=29 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220170543/http://www.nantien.org.au/en/about/history.asp |archivedate=20 February 2011  }}</ref> Sydney's [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-style [[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Great Synagogue]] was consecrated in 1878.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/ |title=The Great Synagogue Sydney \u2013 Home |publisher=Greatsynagogue.org.au |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, [[Australian pubs]] have also been noted for often distinctive designs.\n\nSignificant concern was raised during the 1960s, with developers threatening the destruction of historical buildings, especially in Sydney. Heritage concerns led to union-initiated ''[[green ban]]s'', which saved significant examples of Australia's architectural past. Green bans helped to protect historic 18th-century buildings in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]] from being demolished to make way for office towers, and prevented the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]] from being turned into a car park for the Sydney Opera House.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mundey|first=Jack|title=Green bans and beyond|publisher=Angus and Robertson|location=Sydney|year=1981|isbn=0207143676}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:HydeParkBarracks.JPG|[[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]], Sydney\nFile:PortArthur main lowres.JPG|Convict architecture at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]], Tasmania\nFile:SaintMarys CathedralSydney.jpg|Interior of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney|St Mary's Cathedral]], Sydney\nFile:Royal exhibition building tulips straight.jpg|The [[Royal Exhibition Building]], Melbourne\nFile:Birdsville Hotel.jpg|[[Birdsville]] Hotel, an [[Australian pub]] in outback Queensland\nFile:Parliament House Canberra Dusk Panorama.jpg|[[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]], Canberra\nFile:15 Northcote Avenue, Killara, New South Wales (2011-06-15).jpg|[[Federation Bungalow]] in [[Killara, New South Wales|Killara]], Sydney\nFile:Queenslander East Brisbane 1a.jpg|A typical [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] house in Brisbane\n</gallery>\n\n===Visual arts===\n{{Main|Visual arts of Australia}}\n{{See also|Indigenous Australian art}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n | align     = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 170\n | image1    = Bradshaw rock paintings2.jpg\n | caption1  = [[Bradshaw rock art|Bradshaws]] in the [[Kimberley region]] of Western Australia\n | image2    = Sunbaker maxdupain nga76.54.jpg\n | caption2  = ''[[Sunbaker]]'' (1937), an iconic photograph by [[Max Dupain]]\n}}\nAboriginal [[rock art]] is the oldest continuous art tradition in the world, dating as far back as 60,000 years.

[[Netball]] has the highest participation rate of any women's sport in Australia. Established in 2008, the [[ANZ Championship]] is the premier netball league in Australia and New Zealand, featuring five teams from each country. The [[Australian national netball team]] (the Diamonds) is considered the best in the world, having won 10 of 13 [[World Netball Championships]].\n\nThe Australian [[V8 Supercars]] series is steadily growing in popularity across the world, where television coverage allows.\n\nAustralia regularly raises world champion [[field hockey]] teams. Australian [[Road bicycle racing|cyclists]] have won international cycling competitions, most notably [[Cadel Evans]]' win in the [[2011 Tour de France]]. In 2008, the [[Tour Down Under]], centered around Adelaide, became the first [[UCI ProTour]] cycling race to be held outside of Europe. Among young people and within schools nationwide, various forms of handball or [[downball]] games have been among the most prevalent sports games for some decades.\n\n[[File:Kiandra carnival 1900 Charles Kerry.jpeg|thumb|[[Skiing in Australia]] began in [[Kiandra]], a goldmining town in the [[Snowy Mountains]] of New South Wales, in the 1860s.]]\nSnow sports are enjoyed in the [[Australian Alps]] and in Tasmania. [[Skiing in Australia]] was first introduced by Norwegian miners in the gold mining town of [[Kiandra, New South Wales|Kiandra]] in the [[Snowy Mountains]] of New South Wales around 1859. The sport remains a popular winter activity in the south-eastern states and territories. Major [[alpine skiing]] resorts include [[Thredbo]], [[Perisher Ski Resort|Perisher]] and [[Charlotte Pass]] in New South Wales; [[Mount Hotham]], [[Falls Creek, Victoria|Falls Creek]] and [[Mount Buller]] in Victoria and [[Mount Ben Lomond]] in Tasmania. Extensive areas are available for cross country skiing within national parks including [[Kosciuszko National Park]] (NSW), [[Alpine National Park]] (VIC); [[Namadgi National Park]] (ACT) and in the [[Tasmanian Wilderness]]. Australia has long [[Australia at the Winter Olympics|participated in the Winter Olympics]] and has won medals at the Games since the 1990s.\n\nIncreased interest and participation in American sports has led to opportunities for Australians to play at the top level in sports such as [[baseball]], [[ice hockey]] and [[American football]]. [[Grant Balfour]] is a relief pitcher for the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], and played in the [[2008 World Series]]. Australian basketballers have done well at the Olympics, coming fourth four times. The skill set of Australian rules footballers fits the mould of US [[National Football League]] (NFL) [[Punter (football)|punters]], and they stand out from their American peers with their ability to tackle returners. Two former AFL footballers competed in the 2009 [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Championship game as punters, [[Saverio Rocca]] for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Ben Graham (football player)|Ben Graham]] for the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. Graham's appearance in [[Super Bowl XLIII]] made him the first Australian to play in the NFL's championship game. The first College Bowl game to feature two Australians was the [[2012 BCS National Championship Game]] with punter [[Brad Wing]] from LSU and defensive end [[Jesse Williams (American football)|Jesse Williams]] for Alabama. In 2018, [[Nathan Walker]], the first Australian drafted by an NHL team, also became the first to play on a Stanley Cup winning team, the 2018 Washington Capitals.\n\n==Folklore==\n{{main|Australian folklore}}\n[[File:SIMPSON AND HIS DONKEY MONUMENT.jpg|thumb|upright|A commemorative statue of [[John Simpson Kirkpatrick]], a famous stretcher bearer who was killed in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].]]\nAustralian stories and legends have a cultural significance independent of their empirical truth or falsehood. This can be seen in the portrayal of [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] as a mixture of the underdog and [[Robin Hood]].\n\nMilitarily, Australians have served in numerous overseas wars, ranging from [[World War I]] through to recent regional security missions, such as [[East Timor]], [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Australian war culture generally consists of somber reflection and commemoration, focusing on noble sacrifice rather than glory.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} An annual national holiday, [[Anzac Day]], exists for this purpose. The Australian experience of defeat in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], the first iconic moment in modern Australia's involvement in war, is viewed by Australians with both pride for the fighting of the soldiers, and bitterness for the perceived negligence on the part of British commanders. The incidences of bravery and determination displayed during the campaign for Gallipoli, as well as the mutual respect for their [[Turkey|Turkish]] adversaries led by Kemal [[Atat\u00fcrk]], are seen as part of the [[ANZAC]] spirit. During the First World War, Australian soldiers were considered to be remarkably determined, united and hard-working. Many Australians knew how to ride and shoot prior to enlistment, making them talented recruits, but they were also infamous for their lax attitude towards formal parade ground discipline, a notoriety that the Australian soldiers reveled in. From this the notion of the larrikin [[Digger (soldier)|Digger]] emerged,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} an important part of contemporary Australian identity.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Attitudes, beliefs and stereotypes==\nCritics and scholars have sometimes scrutinized the Australian culture, with aspects of it loosely criticized for being [[kitsch]], low-brow or rooted in poor taste.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memory Fragments: Visualising Difference in Australian History|year=2012|publisher=Intellect Books|first=Marita|last=Bullock|page=17|isbn=9781841505534}}</ref> The term \"[[cultural cringe]]\" was coined to describe this entrenched national inferiority complex which assumes ideas and cultures of other places are automatically superior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/10/1974488.htm |title=Getting over Australia's Cultural Cringe |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=10 July 2007 |accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Arthur Angel | authorlink = A.

A number of well-known actresses played strong (and although unintended, often glamorous) roles as Saxon or Norman ladies, including [[Greta Gynt]], [[Brenda de Banzie]] and [[Jill Esmond]].   \n\nA number of actors appeared in supporting roles in most episodes, for series 1 these include: [[Victor Woolf]], [[Willoughby Gray]], and [[John Longden]], and for later series include: [[Paul Hansard]], [[Morris Barry]], [[Patrick Troughton]], [[Wilfrid Brambell]], [[Nigel Davenport]], [[Kevin Stoney]], [[Ronald Hines]], and [[Max Faulkner (actor)|Max Faulkner]], who also did stunt/double work.

In Series 3 Paul Eddington played a different character in many episodes, before settling down to Will Scarlett.\n\n==Plot and writing==\n[[File:Scene from The Adventures of Robin Hood - Broadcasting, June 30, 1958 03.jpg|thumb|Robin Hood protects Maid Marian and fends off a villain played by John Dearth. (The series was obviously not in color.)]]\nThe series is set in the 12th century, during the reign of [[Richard I of England|King Richard]]. Robin of Locksley, a nobleman, is forced into the life of an outlaw, dwelling in Sherwood Forest with a band of men who right the wrongs committed by the rich and powerful against the poor and defenceless. He was given the name Robin Hood by the outlaw band's leader, Will Scatlock, who was fatally wounded. Hood's enemy in the series is the Sheriff of Nottingham who, with his cohorts, schemes to capture the outlaw by any means possible. Lady Marian Fitzwalter ([[Maid Marian]]), a young noblewoman and Robin Hood's lover, keeps him informed of the Sheriff of Nottingham's whereabouts and intentions. Episodes are punctuated with manly deeds of derring-do, tense escapes and pursuits, princely tournaments, the thundering hoof-beats of powerful steeds, the clattering of flashing swords, and the whizzing of fatally-placed arrows.\n\nIn \"A Year and A Day\" (series 2), a refugee peasant explains that, under English law, a peasant who escapes serfdom and lives in a city for \"a year and a day\" is a free man, given the man lives openly, not in hiding. When Robin Hood helps the peasant move about the city, the Sheriff invokes \"the law of hue and cry\", explaining that any man within hearing must drop his chores and help apprehend the felon. In \"A Christmas Goose\" (series 3), a boy's goose nips a lord's horse so the lord is thrown. The lord condemns the goose to death \u2013 for his Christmas dinner.  But Robin Hood counters that under English common law, an accused animal is entitled to a fair trial, the same as a human. While Robin Hood drags out the trial, Friar Tuck gets the cook drunk and switches geese. When the deception is revealed, the lord relents and pardons the goose. Two episodes, \"Brother Battle\" (#84) and \"To Be a Student\" (#90) emphasized the Catholic Church's struggle to educate commoners, and even the children of serfs, despite laws forbidding the practice and in the face of opposition from the nobility.\n\nThe writers created supporting characters who were likable and occasionally resourceful. In \"The Goldmaker's Return\" (series 2), Robin Hood is away in France on a mission. Lady Marian, Little John, and the other Merry Men carry the day without the star of the show ever showing his face. Most of the time, however, Robin is required to save the day following the usual comment about \"Many men will be noticed.  Only one going in will be successful\", etc. Despite simplistic plotting required by the 30-minute format, the writing was both professional in its handling of situations, and pointed in its dialog. [[Anachronism]]s abound: the lipsticked girl with modern hairdo in the Friar Tuck episode, for instance, wine cups for each occupant at a table in \"Checkmate\" when that only became the practice hundreds of years later, the 20th century school implements in \"Brother Battle\", the use of Guineas from the 1700s as coinage, written tavern signs when most were illiterate, and a \"bard\" in \"The Challenge\" episode who sings a song to the late 17th-century tune of \"[[Lillibullero]]\" in 13th-century England.  All this is typical of every series of historical fiction, but the show's producers pointed with pride to their accuracy, courtesy of hired consultants.\n\nThere was also an element of self-parody at times that sat uneasily on the series{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}. In one episode, \"The Challenge\", the plot-as-such was finished halfway through the show, and during the rest, the hapless Richard of the Lea and his wife worried as their larder and wine cellar were emptied during a siege with Robin, Little John, and Tuck eating and dancing all day and night.\n\n==Episodes==\n:''Main article: [[List of The Adventures of Robin Hood episodes]] (including DVD release information).''\n\n143 episodes were filmed in four series.\n\n==Production details==\n\n=== Blacklisted writers ===\n''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' was produced by [[Hannah Weinstein]], who had left-wing political views. Weinstein hired many [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] American writers to script episodes of the series: these included [[Ring Lardner Jr.]], [[Waldo Salt]], [[Robert Lees]], and [[Adrian Scott]]. [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]], who was also blacklisted, served for a while as the series' [[script editor]]. The blacklisted writers were credited under pseudonyms, to avoid the attention of studio executives.<ref name=\"blacklist\">{{cite news |first=Tom Dewe |last=Matthews |title=The outlaws |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1888594,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 October 2006 |accessdate=11 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\n(The sponsored prints of the first five episodes of series one, screened by CBS in the US on its first run, had no writer credits on their end title sequences; writers were only credited on sponsored prints from episode 6 onward, only later non-sponsored US re-run prints of series one have writer credits for these episodes, some of which differ from writer credits on UK prints. As an example, Lawrence McClellan is credited as writer of \"The Coming of Robin Hood\" on US prints, for the UK the pseudonym used is Eric Heath.)<ref name=Mill>Mill Creek Entertainment set of DVD's (US).</ref>\n\nAfter the blacklist collapsed, Lardner said that the series' format allowed him \"plenty of opportunities to comment on issues and institutions in Eisenhower-era America\"; presumably \"A Tuck in Time\" was such an episode, in which a twin of Friar Tuck arrives boasting of his willingness to sell a weapon that could destroy the world.  In addition to the [[property redistribution|redistributive]] themes of a hero who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, many episodes in the programme's first two seasons included the threat that Robin and his band would be betrayed to the authorities by friends or loved ones, much as the blacklisted writers had been.<ref name=\"blacklist\" /> For example, the 3rd season story \"The Angry Village\" had paranoid villagers turn on each other when they think a traitor is in their midst.    But the half-hour length episodes and broad-target market precluded any political criticism that went beyond the generalities of 19th century Robin Hood revival books.\n\n===Filming===\nWhilst interiors were filmed at [[Nettlefold Studios]], location shooting for the series took place on the nearby [[Ockham and Wisley Commons|Wisley Common]], [[Wisley]], Surrey, and at the adjoining [[Foxwarren Park]] estate, near [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]], owned by Hannah Weinstein. Horses used for filming were also stabled at Foxwarren House, which had a projection room for viewing daily film rushes and completed films. In 1956 a replica castle exterior, complete with drawbridge, was built in the grounds of the estate for filming of ''[[The Adventures of Sir Lancelot]]'' series (it features prominently in title sequence for the colour episodes), this was used predominantly for castle scenes in series 3 & 4 of Robin Hood, it first appears as Chateau Marmont in \"The Bandit of Brittany\" during series 2, in place of the standing castle and village set on the backlot at Nettlefold studios used in series 1 & most of series 2.\n\nAs well as this, establishing shots and short film sequences were also shot at various medieval buildings in the UK including: [[Allington Castle]] in Kent, this was used to establish Fitzwalter Castle, Marian's home in the series, [[Painshill Park]], near Cobham, [[Saltwood Castle]] in [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]], and [[Pencoed Castle]] near [[Magor, Monmouthshire|Magor]] in Monmouthshire. Three Northumberland sites were used \u2013 [[Alnwick Castle]], [[Lindisfarne Castle]], and [[Warkworth Castle]]. Some of the other sites used through the series were [[Bodiam Castle]] in [[East Sussex]], [[Leith Hill]] near [[Dorking]], [[Framlingham Castle]] in Suffolk, [[Newark Priory]] near Ripley, Castle Mill in Dorking, and Newark Mill.\n\n===Crew===\n* Directors of Photography \u2013 Gerald Gibbs (series 1), Ken Hodges (series 1\u20134), [[Ernest Palmer (British cinematographer)|Ernest Palmer]] (series 2), [[Michael Reed (cinematographer)|Michael Reed]] (series 2\u20133), Ian Craig (series 4)\n* Camera Operators \u2013 Noel Rowland (series 1\u20134), Eric Williams (series 4)\n* Art Directors \u2013 Peter Proud (series 1), John Blezard (series 2\u20134), Peter Mullins (series 2\u20133)\n* Production Designer \u2013 Peter Proud (series 2)\n* Art Supervisor \u2013 [[William Kellner]] (series 2)\n* Assistant Director \u2013 Christopher Noble\n* Sound \u2013 H.P.

The poem was a humorous summary vignette of what could be expected in the episode. An actor portraying the Minstrel would use the same melody at the final fade to black before the end credits for 1st run CBS sponsored screenings in the USA, letting viewers know that the sponsor \"now begs a word with you.\"\n\n\"[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]\"\u2014an English ballad actually sung in the 12th century\u2014is featured throughout the series. At times it is heard as background music at parties. In \"The Betrothal,\" Sir Richard's son plays it on his flute while his betrothed sings it. In the episode \"Carlotta,\" Little John sings it to his sweetheart. In \"The Path of True Love,\" Marian sings it to stall Sir Charles. In one of its most prominent uses, Robin forces a group of soldiers to sing it. It is worth noting that this melody was whistled by Little John before his first meeting with Robin in ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' (1938).\n\nThe Merry Men perform the [[soul cake]] song in \"The Thorkil Ghost,\" with Derwent singing a solo.\n\n====Closing theme song====\n[[Carl Sigman]] wrote the words and music for the theme song which was sung by [[Dick James]]. The song is still fondly remembered:\n<blockquote>\nRobin Hood, Robin Hood, Riding through the glen<br />\nRobin Hood, Robin Hood, With his band of men<br />\nFeared by the bad, Loved by the good<br />\nRobin Hood, Robin Hood, Robin Hood<br />\n<br />\nHe called the greatest archers to a tavern on the green<br />\nThey vowed to help the people of the king<br />\nThey handled all the trouble on the English country scene<br />\nAnd still found plenty of time to sing\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n[Chorus (1st paragraph) repeat]<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1956 the theme song was released on [[Parlophone]] records by [[Dick James]] with Stephen James and his chums and [[Ron Goodwin]]'s Orchestra and reached number 14 in the UK charts (78rpm single:R.4117/45rpm single:MSP6199), and by [[Pye Records]] as a 78rpm single by [[Gary Miller (singer)|Gary Miller]] with Tony Osbourne orchestra and the Beryl Stott chorus (PYE N.15020) and reached number 10 on the UK [[Record chart|charts]]. Versions by [[Frankie Laine]] (CBS Coronet), [[Nelson Riddle]] and his Orchestra (Capitol), [[Alan Dale (singer)|Alan Dale]] (Coral), [[Joe Reisman]]'s orchestra and chorus (RCA Victor), and [[Ronnie Ronalde]] (Colombia) were also issued. These versions had the extended song with fives verses and the chorus six times. The sound effect at the start of the theme tune, of the arrow being fired into a tree, was produced by record producer [[Joe Meek]], who was also the recording engineer on the Gary Miller version.<ref>[http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/r/robinhood.shtml ROBIN HOOD \u2013 Lyrics \u2013 International Lyrics Playground]</ref>\n\nThis song was parodied by [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] in their [[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#11. Dennis Moore|Dennis Moore]] sketch, which depicted a masked highwayman from the 18th century (more like the [[Scarlet Pimpernel]]) stealing [[lupin]]s from the rich to give to the poor. It is also played at every [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] home match. It, the titles and the whole show was also parodied in the Hancock's Half Hour episode \"Ericson the Viking\" , where Sid James talks Tony into appearing in an on the cheap historic drama \"Ericson, Ericson, Ericson the Good, Ericson, Ericson, nipping through the wood...ole!\"\n\n\"Robin des Bois\" was the theme recorded for the French TV market, sung in French, it can be heard on the 3rd series episode \"Farewell to Tuck\" released by Network on DVD. The series was first broadcast in France as \"Aventures dans la Foret de Sherwood\" in 1965 on [[ORTF]]. Other countries to broadcast the series include Canada 1955\u20131958 on CBOT, Toronto, and CKCO, Kitchener, Ontario, Australia 1956\u20131961 on [[HSV7]] (The [[Seven Network]]), Finland in 1964 on NORDEEZE, the Netherlands in 1965/66 on [[Algemene Vereniging Radio Omroep|AVRO]] and Germany between 1971 and 1974 on [[Das Erste|ARD]].\n\nFirst series episodes also exist with a variant downbeat instrumental end theme by Edwin Astley, it can be heard on the episode \"The Highlander\" released by Network DVD.\n\n===Artistic details===\nArt director Peter Proud, an expert at wartime camouflage, hit on the idea of putting many props on wheels to facilitate quick set changes, since one 26-minute episode was shot every four and a half days. The show boasted \"140 set pieces (baronial fireplaces, staircases, stone walls, entrance halls, and the like)\". There was some outdoor location filming, mainly involving horse-riding doubles and stuntmen, and without dialogue recording. Sets were designed from parchments and sketches from the [[British Museum]], and modelled on the castles of [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]], [[Farleigh Hungerford Castle|Farleigh]], and [[Framlingham Castle|Framlingham]]. Some of the 100 soldiers who manned the battlements of [[Nottingham Castle]] were miniature toy soldiers.<ref name=\"TVGuide\">\"Meanwhile, Back at the Castle...\", TV Guide, Week of 12\u201318 May 1956.</ref>\n\n===Sponsorship===\n[[File:The Adventures in Sherwood Forest - Broadcasting, June 30, 1958.jpg|thumb|1958 advertisement featuring the series' alternative title, ''The Adventures in Sherwood Forest'']]\nIn the US the original [[CBS]] syndication prints had a few variants to the original UK prints, after the brief title sequence the US prints would repeat this sequence but with \"Brought to You By\" and after the arrow strikes the tree the sponsors name \"Wildroot Cream-Oil\" superimposed, \"Johnson & Johnson\" sponsored episodes had a voice-over over the opening titles \"Richard Greene in The Adventures of Robin Hood\" and over the repeated sequence \"presented by\" followed by the names of two Johnson & Johnson products, images of which would appear over the shot of the arrow in the tree, a commercial featuring one of the products would then be shown, the Wildroot Cream-Oil sponsored episodes would then feature an animated commercial showing a Robin Hood\u2013type figure with lank hair and a dinosaur. A Minstrel song would then be sung at the beginning of each episode, over the episode title, providing a playful poetic synopsis in short prose of what could be expected to be seen. After the final fade to black a sequence featuring an actor playing the Minstrel would be shown as he sang these lyrics to the tune of \"[[Early One Morning]]\": \"We'll have the merry time again with Robin and his Merry Men and the folk who'll bring him to you then now beg a word with you.\" followed by a commercial for the next week's sponsor before the end titles would be shown, (Wildroot Cream Oil and Johnson & Johnson sponsored alternate episodes) the end credits start with the opening sequence, with [[Sandy Becker]] mentioning the sponsors name again, and the sponsors product appearing on screen through the end titles which are shown over the shot of the tree. This caption also appeared: \"This film was flown to the USA via Pan American World Airways\". The opening minstrel tunes were also sung to the tune of '[[Early One Morning]]'. There were two sponsors of the CBS syndicated screenings, Wildroot Cream-Oil (a hair tonic company), and [[Johnson & Johnson]] (known in the UK and US for its baby powder). The commercials involved \"within\" the episodes appeared originally on all three Seasons broadcast at 7.30pm (eastern standard time) /6.30pm (central standard time) Monday nights on CBS (not series 4).<ref name=\"Mill\"/>\n\nAlternative title captions appear over the opening sequence on some US prints. Instead of \"Richard Greene in The Adventures of Robin Hood\" they state \"Richard Greene plays Robin Hood \u2013 Adventures in Sherwood Forest\". This practice occurred because of an FCC rule demanding that reruns of a series be retitled for syndication packaging if aired while first-run episodes of the series were still being shown on one of the three major networks. Five years of \"Gunsmoke\" episodes, for instance, were retitled \"Marshall Dillon\" for syndicated run because \"Gunsmoke\" was still going strong on CBS.\n\nAlternative US end credit titles crediting the series as \"A Hannah Weinstein Production for Sapphire Films Limited\" (and for later episodes from 1958 \"A Hannah Fisher Production\") also exist.\n\nIn the UK, at the time, sponsorship of programmes was not allowed and each episode had one commercial break in the middle.\n\n==Influence==\nThe series was an immediate hit on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], drawing 32,000,000 viewers per week.<ref name=\"TVGuide\"/> Sapphire films were commissioned to make four other series by Lew Grade: ''[[The Adventures of Sir Lancelot]]'' (1956/57) (broadcast by [[NBC]] on Monday nights at 8.00 pm), ''[[The Buccaneers (TV series)|The Buccaneers]]'' (1956/57) (broadcast by [[CBS]] on Saturday nights at 7.30 pm), ''[[Sword of Freedom]]'' (1957/58), and ''[[The Four Just Men (TV series)|The Four Just Men]]'' (1958/59). The success of these inspired other historic drama series like \"The Adventures of William Tell\", \"Sir Francis Drake\", \"The Scarlet Pimpernell\", \"The Count of Monte Cristo\"  and the French \"Thierry la Fronde\" . ITC continued to make and sell TV series to the US until the late 1970s, including ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'', ''[[The Prisoner]]'', ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', ''[[Space 1999]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and many more.\n\n==Merchandise==\n\n===Products===\nMany licensed products and knockoffs were sold, including books, jigsaw puzzles, iron-on patches, toy bows and arrows, a series of bubble gum cards, and more. The \"Robin Hood\" shoe brand sporting Richard Green's likeness on the interior heel lasted long after the series stopped production.

These were as follows:\n*''Robin Hood: The Movie'' (1991) \u2013 featuring edited material from episodes: 1,2,3,5,8 & 27. Notably, Will Scatlock who dies at the end of episode 2 in the series (thereby transferring the outlaw leadership to Robin Hood), is not killed until the end of the 90 min feature.\n*''Robin Hood's Greatest Adventures'' (1991)\n*''Robin Hood: Quest for the Crown'' (1991)\n\n==Film==\n[[Sidney Cole]] and Richard Greene produced the feature film ''[[Sword of Sherwood Forest]]'' (1960), for [[Hammer Film Productions]] (in association with Yeoman Films), directed by [[Terence Fisher]], written by Alan Hackney, director of photography was Ken Hodges, and the film editor was Lee Doig, all TV series alumni. Richard Greene starred as Robin Hood with [[Peter Cushing]] as the Sheriff of Nottingham; blonde haired [[Sarah Branch]] played Maid Marian with [[Nigel Green]] as Little John, [[Jack Gwillim]] as Archbishop [[Hubert Walter]], and [[Richard Pasco]] as Edward, Earl of Newark. [[Oliver Reed]] also had a small role. It was filmed in colour and in a widescreen process referred to as \"Megascope\" on the opening titles. The film itself was a retelling of how Robin first met Marion.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{tv.com show|the-adventures-of-robin-hood|The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n* {{IMDb title|0047706|The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n* {{epguides|id=AdventuresofRobinHood|title=The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n* [http://www.boldoutlaw.com/robspot/greenerobin.html ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'': A Robin Hood Spotlight]\n* [https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22The%20Adventures%20Of%20Robin%20Hood%22 Download episodes of ''The Adventures of Robin Hood''] at the [[Internet Archive]]\n* [http://beta.wnyc.org/shows/fishko/2010/jun/25/  ''Fishko Files'', WNYC, 25 June 2010.]\n\n{{Robin Hood}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adventures Of Robin Hood, The}}\n[[Category:1950s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:1955 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1959 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:Black-and-white British television programmes]]\n[[Category:British adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by ITC Entertainment]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:CBS original programming]]\n[[Category:Television series set in the 12th century]]\n[[Category:Robin Hood television series]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Eleanor of Aquitaine]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of John, King of England]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Richard I of England]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British television series}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = The Adventures of Robin Hood\n| image                    = Robin Hood titlecard.jpg\n| image_alt                = Series title over an image of an arrow in a tree\n| caption                  = \n| genre                    = Drama<br />Adventure<br />[[Folklore]]<br />Period drama\n| creator                  = Based on traditional legends\n| based_on                 = \n| developer                = \n| writer                   = \n| director                 = \n| creative_director        = \n| presenter                = \n| starring                 = [[Richard Greene]]<br />[[Bernadette O'Farrell]]<br />[[Patricia Driscoll]]<br />[[Alexander Gauge]]<br />[[Archie Duncan (actor)|Archie Duncan]]<br />[[Alan Wheatley]]<br />[[John Arnatt]]\n| judges                   = \n| voices                   = \n| narrated                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = [[Edwin Astley]]\n| endtheme                 = [[Carl Sigman]] sung by [[Dick James]]\n| composer                 = Edwin Astley<br />[[Albert Elms]]\n| country                  = United Kingdom\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = 4\n| num_episodes             = 143\n| list_episodes            = List of The Adventures of Robin Hood episodes\n| executive_producer       = [[Hannah Weinstein]]\n| producer                 = [[Sidney Cole]]\n| editor                   = \n| cinematography           = \n| camera                   = \n| runtime                  = 25 minutes\n| company                  = [[Sapphire Films]]\n| distributor              = [[Official Films]]\n| channel                  = [[ATV London]]\n| network                  = \n| picture_format           = [[4:3]] [[35mm movie film|35mm]] [[Black-and-white]]\n| audio_format             = Monaural\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|df=yes|1955|09|25}} (ATV)<ref name=ATVa>First broadcast in UK by ATV London.

In Series 3 Paul Eddington played a different character in many episodes, before settling down to Will Scarlett.\n\n==Plot and writing==\n[[File:Scene from The Adventures of Robin Hood - Broadcasting, June 30, 1958 03.jpg|thumb|Robin Hood protects Maid Marian and fends off a villain played by John Dearth. (The series was obviously not in color.)]]\nThe series is set in the 12th century, during the reign of [[Richard I of England|King Richard]]. Robin of Locksley, a nobleman, is forced into the life of an outlaw, dwelling in Sherwood Forest with a band of men who right the wrongs committed by the rich and powerful against the poor and defenceless. He was given the name Robin Hood by the outlaw band's leader, Will Scatlock, who was fatally wounded. Hood's enemy in the series is the Sheriff of Nottingham who, with his cohorts, schemes to capture the outlaw by any means possible. Lady Marian Fitzwalter ([[Maid Marian]]), a young noblewoman and Robin Hood's lover, keeps him informed of the Sheriff of Nottingham's whereabouts and intentions. Episodes are punctuated with manly deeds of derring-do, tense escapes and pursuits, princely tournaments, the thundering hoof-beats of powerful steeds, the clattering of flashing swords, and the whizzing of fatally-placed arrows.\n\nIn \"A Year and A Day\" (series 2), a refugee peasant explains that, under English law, a peasant who escapes serfdom and lives in a city for \"a year and a day\" is a free man, given the man lives openly, not in hiding. When Robin Hood helps the peasant move about the city, the Sheriff invokes \"the law of hue and cry\", explaining that any man within hearing must drop his chores and help apprehend the felon. In \"A Christmas Goose\" (series 3), a boy's goose nips a lord's horse so the lord is thrown. The lord condemns the goose to death \u2013 for his Christmas dinner.  But Robin Hood counters that under English common law, an accused animal is entitled to a fair trial, the same as a human. While Robin Hood drags out the trial, Friar Tuck gets the cook drunk and switches geese. When the deception is revealed, the lord relents and pardons the goose. Two episodes, \"Brother Battle\" (#84) and \"To Be a Student\" (#90) emphasized the Catholic Church's struggle to educate commoners, and even the children of serfs, despite laws forbidding the practice and in the face of opposition from the nobility.\n\nThe writers created supporting characters who were likable and occasionally resourceful. In \"The Goldmaker's Return\" (series 2), Robin Hood is away in France on a mission. Lady Marian, Little John, and the other Merry Men carry the day without the star of the show ever showing his face. Most of the time, however, Robin is required to save the day following the usual comment about \"Many men will be noticed.  Only one going in will be successful\", etc. Despite simplistic plotting required by the 30-minute format, the writing was both professional in its handling of situations, and pointed in its dialog. [[Anachronism]]s abound: the lipsticked girl with modern hairdo in the Friar Tuck episode, for instance, wine cups for each occupant at a table in \"Checkmate\" when that only became the practice hundreds of years later, the 20th century school implements in \"Brother Battle\", the use of Guineas from the 1700s as coinage, written tavern signs when most were illiterate, and a \"bard\" in \"The Challenge\" episode who sings a song to the late 17th-century tune of \"[[Lillibullero]]\" in 13th-century England.  All this is typical of every series of historical fiction, but the show's producers pointed with pride to their accuracy, courtesy of hired consultants.\n\nThere was also an element of self-parody at times that sat uneasily on the series{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}. In one episode, \"The Challenge\", the plot-as-such was finished halfway through the show, and during the rest, the hapless Richard of the Lea and his wife worried as their larder and wine cellar were emptied during a siege with Robin, Little John, and Tuck eating and dancing all day and night.\n\n==Episodes==\n:''Main article: [[List of The Adventures of Robin Hood episodes]] (including DVD release information).''\n\n143 episodes were filmed in four series.\n\n==Production details==\n\n=== Blacklisted writers ===\n''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' was produced by [[Hannah Weinstein]], who had left-wing political views. Weinstein hired many [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] American writers to script episodes of the series: these included [[Ring Lardner Jr.]], [[Waldo Salt]], [[Robert Lees]], and [[Adrian Scott]]. [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]], who was also blacklisted, served for a while as the series' [[script editor]]. The blacklisted writers were credited under pseudonyms, to avoid the attention of studio executives.<ref name=\"blacklist\">{{cite news |first=Tom Dewe |last=Matthews |title=The outlaws |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1888594,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 October 2006 |accessdate=11 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\n(The sponsored prints of the first five episodes of series one, screened by CBS in the US on its first run, had no writer credits on their end title sequences; writers were only credited on sponsored prints from episode 6 onward, only later non-sponsored US re-run prints of series one have writer credits for these episodes, some of which differ from writer credits on UK prints. As an example, Lawrence McClellan is credited as writer of \"The Coming of Robin Hood\" on US prints, for the UK the pseudonym used is Eric Heath.)<ref name=Mill>Mill Creek Entertainment set of DVD's (US).</ref>\n\nAfter the blacklist collapsed, Lardner said that the series' format allowed him \"plenty of opportunities to comment on issues and institutions in Eisenhower-era America\"; presumably \"A Tuck in Time\" was such an episode, in which a twin of Friar Tuck arrives boasting of his willingness to sell a weapon that could destroy the world.  In addition to the [[property redistribution|redistributive]] themes of a hero who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, many episodes in the programme's first two seasons included the threat that Robin and his band would be betrayed to the authorities by friends or loved ones, much as the blacklisted writers had been.<ref name=\"blacklist\" /> For example, the 3rd season story \"The Angry Village\" had paranoid villagers turn on each other when they think a traitor is in their midst.    But the half-hour length episodes and broad-target market precluded any political criticism that went beyond the generalities of 19th century Robin Hood revival books.\n\n===Filming===\nWhilst interiors were filmed at [[Nettlefold Studios]], location shooting for the series took place on the nearby [[Ockham and Wisley Commons|Wisley Common]], [[Wisley]], Surrey, and at the adjoining [[Foxwarren Park]] estate, near [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]], owned by Hannah Weinstein. Horses used for filming were also stabled at Foxwarren House, which had a projection room for viewing daily film rushes and completed films. In 1956 a replica castle exterior, complete with drawbridge, was built in the grounds of the estate for filming of ''[[The Adventures of Sir Lancelot]]'' series (it features prominently in title sequence for the colour episodes), this was used predominantly for castle scenes in series 3 & 4 of Robin Hood, it first appears as Chateau Marmont in \"The Bandit of Brittany\" during series 2, in place of the standing castle and village set on the backlot at Nettlefold studios used in series 1 & most of series 2.\n\nAs well as this, establishing shots and short film sequences were also shot at various medieval buildings in the UK including: [[Allington Castle]] in Kent, this was used to establish Fitzwalter Castle, Marian's home in the series, [[Painshill Park]], near Cobham, [[Saltwood Castle]] in [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]], and [[Pencoed Castle]] near [[Magor, Monmouthshire|Magor]] in Monmouthshire. Three Northumberland sites were used \u2013 [[Alnwick Castle]], [[Lindisfarne Castle]], and [[Warkworth Castle]]. Some of the other sites used through the series were [[Bodiam Castle]] in [[East Sussex]], [[Leith Hill]] near [[Dorking]], [[Framlingham Castle]] in Suffolk, [[Newark Priory]] near Ripley, Castle Mill in Dorking, and Newark Mill.\n\n===Crew===\n* Directors of Photography \u2013 Gerald Gibbs (series 1), Ken Hodges (series 1\u20134), [[Ernest Palmer (British cinematographer)|Ernest Palmer]] (series 2), [[Michael Reed (cinematographer)|Michael Reed]] (series 2\u20133), Ian Craig (series 4)\n* Camera Operators \u2013 Noel Rowland (series 1\u20134), Eric Williams (series 4)\n* Art Directors \u2013 Peter Proud (series 1), John Blezard (series 2\u20134), Peter Mullins (series 2\u20133)\n* Production Designer \u2013 Peter Proud (series 2)\n* Art Supervisor \u2013 [[William Kellner]] (series 2)\n* Assistant Director \u2013 Christopher Noble\n* Sound \u2013 H.P.

The poem was a humorous summary vignette of what could be expected in the episode. An actor portraying the Minstrel would use the same melody at the final fade to black before the end credits for 1st run CBS sponsored screenings in the USA, letting viewers know that the sponsor \"now begs a word with you.\"\n\n\"[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]\"\u2014an English ballad actually sung in the 12th century\u2014is featured throughout the series. At times it is heard as background music at parties. In \"The Betrothal,\" Sir Richard's son plays it on his flute while his betrothed sings it. In the episode \"Carlotta,\" Little John sings it to his sweetheart. In \"The Path of True Love,\" Marian sings it to stall Sir Charles. In one of its most prominent uses, Robin forces a group of soldiers to sing it. It is worth noting that this melody was whistled by Little John before his first meeting with Robin in ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' (1938).\n\nThe Merry Men perform the [[soul cake]] song in \"The Thorkil Ghost,\" with Derwent singing a solo.\n\n====Closing theme song====\n[[Carl Sigman]] wrote the words and music for the theme song which was sung by [[Dick James]]. The song is still fondly remembered:\n<blockquote>\nRobin Hood, Robin Hood, Riding through the glen<br />\nRobin Hood, Robin Hood, With his band of men<br />\nFeared by the bad, Loved by the good<br />\nRobin Hood, Robin Hood, Robin Hood<br />\n<br />\nHe called the greatest archers to a tavern on the green<br />\nThey vowed to help the people of the king<br />\nThey handled all the trouble on the English country scene<br />\nAnd still found plenty of time to sing\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n[Chorus (1st paragraph) repeat]<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1956 the theme song was released on [[Parlophone]] records by [[Dick James]] with Stephen James and his chums and [[Ron Goodwin]]'s Orchestra and reached number 14 in the UK charts (78rpm single:R.4117/45rpm single:MSP6199), and by [[Pye Records]] as a 78rpm single by [[Gary Miller (singer)|Gary Miller]] with Tony Osbourne orchestra and the Beryl Stott chorus (PYE N.15020) and reached number 10 on the UK [[Record chart|charts]]. Versions by [[Frankie Laine]] (CBS Coronet), [[Nelson Riddle]] and his Orchestra (Capitol), [[Alan Dale (singer)|Alan Dale]] (Coral), [[Joe Reisman]]'s orchestra and chorus (RCA Victor), and [[Ronnie Ronalde]] (Colombia) were also issued. These versions had the extended song with fives verses and the chorus six times. The sound effect at the start of the theme tune, of the arrow being fired into a tree, was produced by record producer [[Joe Meek]], who was also the recording engineer on the Gary Miller version.<ref>[http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/r/robinhood.shtml ROBIN HOOD \u2013 Lyrics \u2013 International Lyrics Playground]</ref>\n\nThis song was parodied by [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] in their [[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#11. Dennis Moore|Dennis Moore]] sketch, which depicted a masked highwayman from the 18th century (more like the [[Scarlet Pimpernel]]) stealing [[lupin]]s from the rich to give to the poor. It is also played at every [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] home match. It, the titles and the whole show was also parodied in the Hancock's Half Hour episode \"Ericson the Viking\" , where Sid James talks Tony into appearing in an on the cheap historic drama \"Ericson, Ericson, Ericson the Good, Ericson, Ericson, nipping through the wood...ole!\"\n\n\"Robin des Bois\" was the theme recorded for the French TV market, sung in French, it can be heard on the 3rd series episode \"Farewell to Tuck\" released by Network on DVD. The series was first broadcast in France as \"Aventures dans la Foret de Sherwood\" in 1965 on [[ORTF]]. Other countries to broadcast the series include Canada 1955\u20131958 on CBOT, Toronto, and CKCO, Kitchener, Ontario, Australia 1956\u20131961 on [[HSV7]] (The [[Seven Network]]), Finland in 1964 on NORDEEZE, the Netherlands in 1965/66 on [[Algemene Vereniging Radio Omroep|AVRO]] and Germany between 1971 and 1974 on [[Das Erste|ARD]].\n\nFirst series episodes also exist with a variant downbeat instrumental end theme by Edwin Astley, it can be heard on the episode \"The Highlander\" released by Network DVD.\n\n===Artistic details===\nArt director Peter Proud, an expert at wartime camouflage, hit on the idea of putting many props on wheels to facilitate quick set changes, since one 26-minute episode was shot every four and a half days. The show boasted \"140 set pieces (baronial fireplaces, staircases, stone walls, entrance halls, and the like)\". There was some outdoor location filming, mainly involving horse-riding doubles and stuntmen, and without dialogue recording. Sets were designed from parchments and sketches from the [[British Museum]], and modelled on the castles of [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]], [[Farleigh Hungerford Castle|Farleigh]], and [[Framlingham Castle|Framlingham]]. Some of the 100 soldiers who manned the battlements of [[Nottingham Castle]] were miniature toy soldiers.<ref name=\"TVGuide\">\"Meanwhile, Back at the Castle...\", TV Guide, Week of 12\u201318 May 1956.</ref>\n\n===Sponsorship===\n[[File:The Adventures in Sherwood Forest - Broadcasting, June 30, 1958.jpg|thumb|1958 advertisement featuring the series' alternative title, ''The Adventures in Sherwood Forest'']]\nIn the US the original [[CBS]] syndication prints had a few variants to the original UK prints, after the brief title sequence the US prints would repeat this sequence but with \"Brought to You By\" and after the arrow strikes the tree the sponsors name \"Wildroot Cream-Oil\" superimposed, \"Johnson & Johnson\" sponsored episodes had a voice-over over the opening titles \"Richard Greene in The Adventures of Robin Hood\" and over the repeated sequence \"presented by\" followed by the names of two Johnson & Johnson products, images of which would appear over the shot of the arrow in the tree, a commercial featuring one of the products would then be shown, the Wildroot Cream-Oil sponsored episodes would then feature an animated commercial showing a Robin Hood\u2013type figure with lank hair and a dinosaur. A Minstrel song would then be sung at the beginning of each episode, over the episode title, providing a playful poetic synopsis in short prose of what could be expected to be seen. After the final fade to black a sequence featuring an actor playing the Minstrel would be shown as he sang these lyrics to the tune of \"[[Early One Morning]]\": \"We'll have the merry time again with Robin and his Merry Men and the folk who'll bring him to you then now beg a word with you.\" followed by a commercial for the next week's sponsor before the end titles would be shown, (Wildroot Cream Oil and Johnson & Johnson sponsored alternate episodes) the end credits start with the opening sequence, with [[Sandy Becker]] mentioning the sponsors name again, and the sponsors product appearing on screen through the end titles which are shown over the shot of the tree. This caption also appeared: \"This film was flown to the USA via Pan American World Airways\". The opening minstrel tunes were also sung to the tune of '[[Early One Morning]]'. There were two sponsors of the CBS syndicated screenings, Wildroot Cream-Oil (a hair tonic company), and [[Johnson & Johnson]] (known in the UK and US for its baby powder). The commercials involved \"within\" the episodes appeared originally on all three Seasons broadcast at 7.30pm (eastern standard time) /6.30pm (central standard time) Monday nights on CBS (not series 4).<ref name=\"Mill\"/>\n\nAlternative title captions appear over the opening sequence on some US prints. Instead of \"Richard Greene in The Adventures of Robin Hood\" they state \"Richard Greene plays Robin Hood \u2013 Adventures in Sherwood Forest\". This practice occurred because of an FCC rule demanding that reruns of a series be retitled for syndication packaging if aired while first-run episodes of the series were still being shown on one of the three major networks. Five years of \"Gunsmoke\" episodes, for instance, were retitled \"Marshall Dillon\" for syndicated run because \"Gunsmoke\" was still going strong on CBS.\n\nAlternative US end credit titles crediting the series as \"A Hannah Weinstein Production for Sapphire Films Limited\" (and for later episodes from 1958 \"A Hannah Fisher Production\") also exist.\n\nIn the UK, at the time, sponsorship of programmes was not allowed and each episode had one commercial break in the middle.\n\n==Influence==\nThe series was an immediate hit on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], drawing 32,000,000 viewers per week.<ref name=\"TVGuide\"/> Sapphire films were commissioned to make four other series by Lew Grade: ''[[The Adventures of Sir Lancelot]]'' (1956/57) (broadcast by [[NBC]] on Monday nights at 8.00 pm), ''[[The Buccaneers (TV series)|The Buccaneers]]'' (1956/57) (broadcast by [[CBS]] on Saturday nights at 7.30 pm), ''[[Sword of Freedom]]'' (1957/58), and ''[[The Four Just Men (TV series)|The Four Just Men]]'' (1958/59). The success of these inspired other historic drama series like \"The Adventures of William Tell\", \"Sir Francis Drake\", \"The Scarlet Pimpernell\", \"The Count of Monte Cristo\"  and the French \"Thierry la Fronde\" . ITC continued to make and sell TV series to the US until the late 1970s, including ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'', ''[[The Prisoner]]'', ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', ''[[Space 1999]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and many more.\n\n==Merchandise==\n\n===Products===\nMany licensed products and knockoffs were sold, including books, jigsaw puzzles, iron-on patches, toy bows and arrows, a series of bubble gum cards, and more. The \"Robin Hood\" shoe brand sporting Richard Green's likeness on the interior heel lasted long after the series stopped production. Magazine Enterprises featured Richard Greene photos on three Robin Hood comic books. Robin and Marian made the cover of TV Guide in the Week of 12\u201318 May 1956.\n\n===DVD===\nIn Region 1, [[Mill Creek Entertainment]] has released all 4 seasons on DVD.  They have also released a complete series set featuring all 143 episodes of the series.<ref>[http://www.millcreekent.com/adventures-of-robin-hood-the-complete-series.html Adventures of Robin Hood \u2013 The Complete Series]</ref>\n\n[[Alpha Video]] has released 22 single volume collections of the series, featuring various episodes.<ref>[http://www.oldies.com/collection-view/The-Adventures-of-Robin-Hood-TV.html The Adventures of Robin Hood]</ref>\n\nIn Region 2, [[Network DVD]] has released all 4 seasons on DVD in the UK.\n\nThree DVD boxsets of the series have also been released in Germany by KNM Home Entertainment as \"Die Abenteuer Von Robin Hood\" with German language soundtracks in 2009.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|DVD Name\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Ep#\n! colspan=\"2\"|Release dates\n|-\n!

These were as follows:\n*''Robin Hood: The Movie'' (1991) \u2013 featuring edited material from episodes: 1,2,3,5,8 & 27. Notably, Will Scatlock who dies at the end of episode 2 in the series (thereby transferring the outlaw leadership to Robin Hood), is not killed until the end of the 90 min feature.\n*''Robin Hood's Greatest Adventures'' (1991)\n*''Robin Hood: Quest for the Crown'' (1991)\n\n==Film==\n[[Sidney Cole]] and Richard Greene produced the feature film ''[[Sword of Sherwood Forest]]'' (1960), for [[Hammer Film Productions]] (in association with Yeoman Films), directed by [[Terence Fisher]], written by Alan Hackney, director of photography was Ken Hodges, and the film editor was Lee Doig, all TV series alumni. Richard Greene starred as Robin Hood with [[Peter Cushing]] as the Sheriff of Nottingham; blonde haired [[Sarah Branch]] played Maid Marian with [[Nigel Green]] as Little John, [[Jack Gwillim]] as Archbishop [[Hubert Walter]], and [[Richard Pasco]] as Edward, Earl of Newark. [[Oliver Reed]] also had a small role. It was filmed in colour and in a widescreen process referred to as \"Megascope\" on the opening titles. The film itself was a retelling of how Robin first met Marion.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{tv.com show|the-adventures-of-robin-hood|The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n* {{IMDb title|0047706|The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n* {{epguides|id=AdventuresofRobinHood|title=The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n* [http://www.boldoutlaw.com/robspot/greenerobin.html ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'': A Robin Hood Spotlight]\n* [https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22The%20Adventures%20Of%20Robin%20Hood%22 Download episodes of ''The Adventures of Robin Hood''] at the [[Internet Archive]]\n* [http://beta.wnyc.org/shows/fishko/2010/jun/25/  ''Fishko Files'', WNYC, 25 June 2010.]\n\n{{Robin Hood}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adventures Of Robin Hood, The}}\n[[Category:1950s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:1955 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1959 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:Black-and-white British television programmes]]\n[[Category:British adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by ITC Entertainment]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:CBS original programming]]\n[[Category:Television series set in the 12th century]]\n[[Category:Robin Hood television series]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Eleanor of Aquitaine]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of John, King of England]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Richard I of England]]\n", "name_user": "Thunderbirds12345", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOther actors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Robin_Hood_(TV_series)"}

After playing [[college basketball]] for [[Duke University]], Hill played for four teams in his professional career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA): The [[Detroit Pistons]], the [[Orlando Magic]], the [[Phoenix Suns]], and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. For most of his career, he played the small forward position. Hill also co-hosts ''[[NBA Inside Stuff]]'' on [[NBA TV]].\n\nHill played basketball at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke University]] for four years. He was the 1994 [[Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|ACC Player of the Year]], a two-time [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American]], and a two-time [[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions|NCAA champion]]. Hill was touted as one of the best players in Duke history and as one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.\n\nAfter graduating from Duke in 1994, Hill was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] with the third overall pick in the [[1994 NBA draft|NBA draft]]. He was the co-winner of the 1995 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Early in his NBA career, Hill was widely considered to be one of the best all-around players in the game, often leading his team in points, [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and [[assist (basketball)|assists]]. In his first six seasons in the NBA, Hill averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game and made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team five times. However, the trajectory of his career was altered by a 2000 ankle injury. The injury continued to plague him for several years, led to a March 2003 surgery that was followed by life-threatening complications, and forced him to miss the entire 2003\u201304 season. In 2005, Hill made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team as a member of the Magic. He played in the Western Conference Finals in 2010 during his tenure with the Phoenix Suns. In the 12 seasons following his ankle injury, Hill averaged 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On June 1, 2013, Hill announced his retirement from the NBA. He is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]], a five-time [[All-NBA]] selection, and a three-time winner of the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]]. In 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nAn ownership group including Hill and [[Tony Ressler]] purchased the [[Atlanta Hawks]] on June 24, 2015.\n\n==College basketball career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen the time came to choose a college, Hill's mother told the [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] documentary ''[[Beyond the Glory]]'', that she wanted him to attend [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], while his father preferred the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]]. Hill decided to attend [[Duke University]], playing four years with the [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Blue Devils]] and winning national titles in [[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991]] and [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]]. Duke became the first Division I program to win consecutive titles since [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in [[1973 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1973]]. Despite losing two of the biggest contributors on the Blue Devils, [[Christian Laettner]] (in 1992) and [[Bobby Hurley]] (each of whom went on to play in the NBA), Hill led Duke to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|championship game]] once again in [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1994]], but lost to [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] [[1993\u201394 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team|Razorbacks]]. Hill won the [[Henry Iba Corinthian Award]] as the nation's top defensive player in 1993, and in 1994 he was the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Player of the Year. During his collegiate career, Hill became the first player in ACC history to collect more than 1,900 points, 700 rebounds, 400 assists, 200 steals and 100 blocked shots. As a result of his successful college career, he became the eighth player in Duke history to have his jersey number (33) retired. After his freshman season at Duke, Hill played on the bronze medal-winning U.S. team at the [[1991 Pan American Games]], held in [[Havana]], Cuba.\n\nHill also is widely known for his role in a desperation play in an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] regional final against [[1991\u201392 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in 1992, which is considered by many to be [[The Shot (Duke\u2013Kentucky)|one of the greatest college basketball games of all time]]. With Duke down 103\u2013102 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] and 2.1 seconds remaining after Kentucky's [[Sean Woods]] hit a floater, an unguarded Hill heaved the in-bounds pass 75 feet across the court into the hands of Laettner, who dribbled once and spun before pulling up to make the game-winning jumper from just outside the free-throw line as time expired.\n\nTouted as one of the best players in Duke history, many went as far as to say that Hill was one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.<ref>Brodess, Doug (October 24, 2011).

Hill ended up sharing [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]] honors with [[Jason Kidd]] of the [[Dallas Mavericks]], becoming the first Piston since [[Dave Bing]] in [[1966\u201367 NBA season|1966\u201367]] to win the award. Hill also won the ''[[Sporting News]]'' Rookie of the Year Award. He was named to the all-NBA First Team in 1997, and all-NBA Second Teams in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000.

During the 1995\u201396 season, Hill showcased his all-round abilities by leading the NBA in [[triple-double]]s (10). He also won a [[gold medal]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]] as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team#1996 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team|U.S. men's basketball team]], where he had the team's fifth highest scoring average (9.7) and led the team in steals (18). In [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], Hill averaged 21.4 points, 9.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. He became the first player since [[Larry Bird]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] to average 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists in a season, an accomplishment that had not been duplicated until [[Russell Westbrook]] averaged a triple-double in the [[2016-17 NBA season]]. Once again, Hill led the league in triple-doubles, where his 13 triple-doubles represented 35 percent of the league's triple-double total that season. He was the league's Player of the Month for January and was also awarded NBA's [[IBM Award]], given to the player with the biggest statistical contributions to his team. He finished third in [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting, behind [[Karl Malone]] and Michael Jordan.\n\nMuch like [[Scottie Pippen]] with the [[Chicago Bulls|Bulls]], Hill assumed the role of a \"[[point forward]]\" in Detroit, running the Pistons' offense. As a result, between the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]] and [[1998\u201399 NBA season]]s, Hill was the league leader in assists per game among non-guards all four seasons. In the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|lockout-shortened 1999 season]], as he led his team in points, rebounds and assists for the third time, Hill joined [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Elgin Baylor]] as the only players in NBA history to lead their teams in scoring, rebounding and assists more than once. Hill and Chamberlain are the only two players in league history to lead their teams in points, rebounds and assists per game three times. Hill was selected to play in the [[1998 FIBA World Championship]], but in the end no NBA players played in this tournament due to the [[lockout (industry)|lockout]].\n\nIn [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], Hill averaged 25.8 points while shooting 49% from the field, the season's third highest scoring average, behind MVP [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Allen Iverson]]. He averaged 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game. However, despite Hill's individual accomplishments in Detroit, the Pistons never made it far in the playoffs, either losing in the first round ([[1996 NBA Playoffs|1996]], [[1997 NBA Playoffs|1997]] and [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]]), or missing the playoffs entirely in the 1994\u201395 and [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 seasons]]. The [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000 playoffs]] would be no different. On April 15, 2000, 7 days before the start of the playoffs, Hill sprained his left ankle in a game against the [[1999\u20132000 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]. He continued to play until the first round playoff series against the [[1999\u20132000 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], in which his injured ankle got worse and Hill was forced to leave halfway through game 2. Eventually, the Heat swept the Pistons 3\u20130. Hill was initially selected for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] U.S. team, but could not play due to the ankle injury. That ankle injury would prove to be a major liability for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/17/grant-hill-on-wfan-ankle-nightmare-would-have-been-avoided-with-knicks/|title=Grant Hill: Ankle Nightmare Would Have Been Avoided With Knicks|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the first six seasons of his career, before ankle injury, Hill had amassed a total of 9,393 points, 3,417 rebounds and 2,720 assists. [[Oscar Robertson]], Bird, and [[LeBron James]] are the only three players in league history to eclipse these numbers after their first six seasons.\n\n===Orlando Magic (2000\u20132007)===\nAs an unrestricted free agent, Hill had planned to sign with the [[2000\u201301 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]]. On August 3, 2000, however, a sign-and-trade deal allowed Hill to receive a slightly more lucrative contract while Detroit received at least some compensation for losing him. The Pistons signed Hill to a seven-year, $92.8 million contract and traded him to Orlando for [[Chucky Atkins]] and [[Ben Wallace]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Magic's Strength No Illusion|date = August 3, 2000|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/magics-strength-no-illusion/|work = CBS News|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}</ref> The Magic hoped he would team up with budding superstar [[Tracy McGrady]], who had been signed away from the [[Toronto Raptors]] at that time, to return Orlando among the NBA elite. But Hill was hampered by ankle injuries, playing in only four games in his [[2000\u201301 NBA season|first]] season with the Magic, 14 games in his [[2001\u201302 NBA season|second]] and 29 in his [[2002\u201303 NBA season|third]]. He was forced to sit out his ''entire'' fourth year with Orlando ([[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]]). Meanwhile, the Pistons, who had defeated the Magic in the [[2003 NBA Playoffs|2003 Playoffs]], but ended up losing to the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference Finals, won the championship the following year in [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2004]].\n\nIn March 2003, Hill underwent a major surgical procedure in which doctors re-fractured his ankle and realigned it with his leg bone. Five days after the surgery was performed, Hill developed a 104.5&nbsp;\u00b0F (40.3&nbsp;\u00b0C) [[fever]] and [[convulsion]]s, and was rushed to a hospital. Doctors removed the splint around his ankle and discovered that Hill had contracted a potentially fatal [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) infection. He was hospitalized for a week and had to take [[intravenous]] [[antibiotics]] for six months.\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] Hill, though hampered by a bruised left shin that caused him to miss several games, started and played 67 games for the Magic. He was named the Eastern Conference player of the week for the week between November 15\u201321, 2004. Over the season, Hill averaged 19.7 points per game on a .509 field goal percentage. Fans voted him an All-Star starter again, and he led the Eastern Conference All-Star Team to a victory over the West. In addition, at the conclusion of the season, Hill was awarded the [[Joe Dumars Trophy]] presented to the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]] Winner.\n\nDuring the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] Hill was once again injured frequently as nagging groin injuries kept him sidelined for much of the first half of the season, limiting him to 21 games. He got a sports [[hernia]] that was caused by an uneven pressure on Hill's feet while he was running, due to concerns that he could re-aggravate the injury on his left ankle if it got too much pressure. Hill underwent surgery for the hernia and stated that he would consider retirement if he had to get another surgery.\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]] Hill returned from injuries despite numerous rumors surrounding his retirement. Hill received ankle rotation therapy from specialists in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] during the off-season and stated that he had regained much motion in his left ankle. Hill returned to the Magic lineup, starting at the [[shooting guard]] position. Despite having problems with injuries to his left knee and a [[tendon]] in his left ankle, Hill managed to play 65 games, two short of the highest number of games he played over a single season as a member of the Magic. He finished the season with averages of 14.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. This season would see Hill return to the playoffs for the first time since 2000, his first playoff appearance with the Magic. The 8th seed Magic would meet Hill's old team, the [[2006\u201307 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], in the first round. The Pistons' vast playoff experience would prevail over the inexperienced Magic, who had not seen significant post-season action for some years, and despite having some close games, the series would end with a 4\u20130 Pistons sweep, leaving Hill undecided on whether to return for the [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2007\u201308 season]] with the Magic, sign with another team, or retire.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2852728 Beset by injuries in career, Hill considers retirement], updated April 28, 2007</ref>\n\n===Phoenix Suns (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Grant Hill Phoenix.jpg|thumb|right|Hill with the Phoenix Suns in 2009]]\nHill became an [[unrestricted free agent]] on July 1, 2007.

Hill was named captain along with [[Steve Nash]]. Hill was given permission by [[Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor|Suns Ring of Honor]] member, [[Alvan Adams]], to wear his familiar No. 33 with the Suns. Hill adapted well to the Suns' up-tempo style, averaging double figures in points as a key role player for Phoenix in the early months of the 2007\u201308 season. He played in the team's first 34 games before an emergency appendectomy on January 9, 2008, sidelined him for two weeks. Despite being bothered by multiple injuries throughout the season, Hill had his first 70-game season since leaving Detroit, averaging 13.1 ppg, 5.0 rpg and 2.9 apg in the process.\n\nPlaying for the Phoenix Suns in the 2008\u20132009 season, Hill appeared in all 82 games for the first time in his career and averaged 12.0 ppg, 4.90 rpg, and 2.3 apg, scoring 27 points and 10 rebounds in the Suns' season finale.\n\nOn July 10, 2009, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Hill decided to re-sign with the Phoenix Suns for a 2-year deal, despite an offer from the [[2009\u201310 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] for the full mid-level exception and the [[2009\u201310 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] offering Hill the bi-annual exception.<ref>Aldridge, David.

After playing [[college basketball]] for [[Duke University]], Hill played for four teams in his professional career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA): The [[Detroit Pistons]], the [[Orlando Magic]], the [[Phoenix Suns]], and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. For most of his career, he played the small forward position. Hill also co-hosts ''[[NBA Inside Stuff]]'' on [[NBA TV]].\n\nHill played basketball at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke University]] for four years. He was the 1994 [[Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|ACC Player of the Year]], a two-time [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American]], and a two-time [[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions|NCAA champion]]. Hill was touted as one of the best players in Duke history and as one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.\n\nAfter graduating from Duke in 1994, Hill was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] with the third overall pick in the [[1994 NBA draft|NBA draft]]. He was the co-winner of the 1995 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Early in his NBA career, Hill was widely considered to be one of the best all-around players in the game, often leading his team in points, [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and [[assist (basketball)|assists]]. In his first six seasons in the NBA, Hill averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game and made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team five times. However, the trajectory of his career was altered by a 2000 ankle injury. The injury continued to plague him for several years, led to a March 2003 surgery that was followed by life-threatening complications, and forced him to miss the entire 2003\u201304 season. In 2005, Hill made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team as a member of the Magic. He played in the Western Conference Finals in 2010 during his tenure with the Phoenix Suns. In the 12 seasons following his ankle injury, Hill averaged 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On June 1, 2013, Hill announced his retirement from the NBA. He is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]], a five-time [[All-NBA]] selection, and a three-time winner of the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]]. In 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nAn ownership group including Hill and [[Tony Ressler]] purchased the [[Atlanta Hawks]] on June 24, 2015.\n\n==College basketball career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen the time came to choose a college, Hill's mother told the [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] documentary ''[[Beyond the Glory]]'', that she wanted him to attend [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], while his father preferred the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]]. Hill decided to attend [[Duke University]], playing four years with the [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Blue Devils]] and winning national titles in [[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991]] and [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]]. Duke became the first Division I program to win consecutive titles since [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in [[1973 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1973]]. Despite losing two of the biggest contributors on the Blue Devils, [[Christian Laettner]] (in 1992) and [[Bobby Hurley]] (each of whom went on to play in the NBA), Hill led Duke to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|championship game]] once again in [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1994]], but lost to [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] [[1993\u201394 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team|Razorbacks]]. Hill won the [[Henry Iba Corinthian Award]] as the nation's top defensive player in 1993, and in 1994 he was the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Player of the Year. During his collegiate career, Hill became the first player in ACC history to collect more than 1,900 points, 700 rebounds, 400 assists, 200 steals and 100 blocked shots. As a result of his successful college career, he became the eighth player in Duke history to have his jersey number (33) retired. After his freshman season at Duke, Hill played on the bronze medal-winning U.S. team at the [[1991 Pan American Games]], held in [[Havana]], Cuba.\n\nHill also is widely known for his role in a desperation play in an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] regional final against [[1991\u201392 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in 1992, which is considered by many to be [[The Shot (Duke\u2013Kentucky)|one of the greatest college basketball games of all time]]. With Duke down 103\u2013102 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] and 2.1 seconds remaining after Kentucky's [[Sean Woods]] hit a floater, an unguarded Hill heaved the in-bounds pass 75 feet across the court into the hands of Laettner, who dribbled once and spun before pulling up to make the game-winning jumper from just outside the free-throw line as time expired.\n\nTouted as one of the best players in Duke history, many went as far as to say that Hill was one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.<ref>Brodess, Doug (October 24, 2011).

He generally played the small forward position during his NBA career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/sports/2013/08/versatile-nba-players-history/grant-hill|title=The 25 Most Versatile Players in NBA History|last=Sibor|first=Doug|work=Complex.com|date=August 14, 2013|access-date=November 25, 2019}}</ref> In his first season, he averaged 19.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.77 steals per game, and became the first Pistons rookie since [[Isiah Thomas]] in [[1981\u201382 NBA season|1981\u201382]] to score 1000 points. Hill ended up sharing [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]] honors with [[Jason Kidd]] of the [[Dallas Mavericks]], becoming the first Piston since [[Dave Bing]] in [[1966\u201367 NBA season|1966\u201367]] to win the award. Hill also won the ''[[Sporting News]]'' Rookie of the Year Award. He was named to the all-NBA First Team in 1997, and all-NBA Second Teams in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Hill also regularly played in the [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]], where he made history by being the first rookie to lead an NBA All-Star fan balloting in ([[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]]) with 1,289,585 votes,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6325252_ITM | work=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service | title=Hill's record 1,289,585 votes will go down in all-star history.

In addition, he became the first rookie in any of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports leagues]] to lead all-star fan voting.\n\nIn his second season ([[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]]), he once again led the All-Star fan balloting, this time edging [[Michael Jordan]] (Jordan's first All-Star game after returning since retiring in 1993). During the 1995\u201396 season, Hill showcased his all-round abilities by leading the NBA in [[triple-double]]s (10). He also won a [[gold medal]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]] as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team#1996 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team|U.S. men's basketball team]], where he had the team's fifth highest scoring average (9.7) and led the team in steals (18). In [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], Hill averaged 21.4 points, 9.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. He became the first player since [[Larry Bird]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] to average 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists in a season, an accomplishment that had not been duplicated until [[Russell Westbrook]] averaged a triple-double in the [[2016-17 NBA season]]. Once again, Hill led the league in triple-doubles, where his 13 triple-doubles represented 35 percent of the league's triple-double total that season. He was the league's Player of the Month for January and was also awarded NBA's [[IBM Award]], given to the player with the biggest statistical contributions to his team. He finished third in [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting, behind [[Karl Malone]] and Michael Jordan.\n\nMuch like [[Scottie Pippen]] with the [[Chicago Bulls|Bulls]], Hill assumed the role of a \"[[point forward]]\" in Detroit, running the Pistons' offense. As a result, between the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]] and [[1998\u201399 NBA season]]s, Hill was the league leader in assists per game among non-guards all four seasons. In the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|lockout-shortened 1999 season]], as he led his team in points, rebounds and assists for the third time, Hill joined [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Elgin Baylor]] as the only players in NBA history to lead their teams in scoring, rebounding and assists more than once. Hill and Chamberlain are the only two players in league history to lead their teams in points, rebounds and assists per game three times. Hill was selected to play in the [[1998 FIBA World Championship]], but in the end no NBA players played in this tournament due to the [[lockout (industry)|lockout]].\n\nIn [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], Hill averaged 25.8 points while shooting 49% from the field, the season's third highest scoring average, behind MVP [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Allen Iverson]]. He averaged 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game. However, despite Hill's individual accomplishments in Detroit, the Pistons never made it far in the playoffs, either losing in the first round ([[1996 NBA Playoffs|1996]], [[1997 NBA Playoffs|1997]] and [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]]), or missing the playoffs entirely in the 1994\u201395 and [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 seasons]]. The [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000 playoffs]] would be no different. On April 15, 2000, 7 days before the start of the playoffs, Hill sprained his left ankle in a game against the [[1999\u20132000 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]. He continued to play until the first round playoff series against the [[1999\u20132000 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], in which his injured ankle got worse and Hill was forced to leave halfway through game 2. Eventually, the Heat swept the Pistons 3\u20130. Hill was initially selected for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] U.S. team, but could not play due to the ankle injury. That ankle injury would prove to be a major liability for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/17/grant-hill-on-wfan-ankle-nightmare-would-have-been-avoided-with-knicks/|title=Grant Hill: Ankle Nightmare Would Have Been Avoided With Knicks|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the first six seasons of his career, before ankle injury, Hill had amassed a total of 9,393 points, 3,417 rebounds and 2,720 assists. [[Oscar Robertson]], Bird, and [[LeBron James]] are the only three players in league history to eclipse these numbers after their first six seasons.\n\n===Orlando Magic (2000\u20132007)===\nAs an unrestricted free agent, Hill had planned to sign with the [[2000\u201301 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]]. On August 3, 2000, however, a sign-and-trade deal allowed Hill to receive a slightly more lucrative contract while Detroit received at least some compensation for losing him. The Pistons signed Hill to a seven-year, $92.8 million contract and traded him to Orlando for [[Chucky Atkins]] and [[Ben Wallace]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Magic's Strength No Illusion|date = August 3, 2000|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/magics-strength-no-illusion/|work = CBS News|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}</ref> The Magic hoped he would team up with budding superstar [[Tracy McGrady]], who had been signed away from the [[Toronto Raptors]] at that time, to return Orlando among the NBA elite. But Hill was hampered by ankle injuries, playing in only four games in his [[2000\u201301 NBA season|first]] season with the Magic, 14 games in his [[2001\u201302 NBA season|second]] and 29 in his [[2002\u201303 NBA season|third]]. He was forced to sit out his ''entire'' fourth year with Orlando ([[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]]). Meanwhile, the Pistons, who had defeated the Magic in the [[2003 NBA Playoffs|2003 Playoffs]], but ended up losing to the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference Finals, won the championship the following year in [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2004]].\n\nIn March 2003, Hill underwent a major surgical procedure in which doctors re-fractured his ankle and realigned it with his leg bone. Five days after the surgery was performed, Hill developed a 104.5&nbsp;\u00b0F (40.3&nbsp;\u00b0C) [[fever]] and [[convulsion]]s, and was rushed to a hospital. Doctors removed the splint around his ankle and discovered that Hill had contracted a potentially fatal [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) infection. He was hospitalized for a week and had to take [[intravenous]] [[antibiotics]] for six months.\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] Hill, though hampered by a bruised left shin that caused him to miss several games, started and played 67 games for the Magic. He was named the Eastern Conference player of the week for the week between November 15\u201321, 2004. Over the season, Hill averaged 19.7 points per game on a .509 field goal percentage. Fans voted him an All-Star starter again, and he led the Eastern Conference All-Star Team to a victory over the West. In addition, at the conclusion of the season, Hill was awarded the [[Joe Dumars Trophy]] presented to the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]] Winner.\n\nDuring the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] Hill was once again injured frequently as nagging groin injuries kept him sidelined for much of the first half of the season, limiting him to 21 games. He got a sports [[hernia]] that was caused by an uneven pressure on Hill's feet while he was running, due to concerns that he could re-aggravate the injury on his left ankle if it got too much pressure. Hill underwent surgery for the hernia and stated that he would consider retirement if he had to get another surgery.\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]] Hill returned from injuries despite numerous rumors surrounding his retirement. Hill received ankle rotation therapy from specialists in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] during the off-season and stated that he had regained much motion in his left ankle. Hill returned to the Magic lineup, starting at the [[shooting guard]] position. Despite having problems with injuries to his left knee and a [[tendon]] in his left ankle, Hill managed to play 65 games, two short of the highest number of games he played over a single season as a member of the Magic. He finished the season with averages of 14.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. This season would see Hill return to the playoffs for the first time since 2000, his first playoff appearance with the Magic. The 8th seed Magic would meet Hill's old team, the [[2006\u201307 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], in the first round. The Pistons' vast playoff experience would prevail over the inexperienced Magic, who had not seen significant post-season action for some years, and despite having some close games, the series would end with a 4\u20130 Pistons sweep, leaving Hill undecided on whether to return for the [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2007\u201308 season]] with the Magic, sign with another team, or retire.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2852728 Beset by injuries in career, Hill considers retirement], updated April 28, 2007</ref>\n\n===Phoenix Suns (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Grant Hill Phoenix.jpg|thumb|right|Hill with the Phoenix Suns in 2009]]\nHill became an [[unrestricted free agent]] on July 1, 2007.

Hill adapted well to the Suns' up-tempo style, averaging double figures in points as a key role player for Phoenix in the early months of the 2007\u201308 season. He played in the team's first 34 games before an emergency appendectomy on January 9, 2008, sidelined him for two weeks. Despite being bothered by multiple injuries throughout the season, Hill had his first 70-game season since leaving Detroit, averaging 13.1 ppg, 5.0 rpg and 2.9 apg in the process.\n\nPlaying for the Phoenix Suns in the 2008\u20132009 season, Hill appeared in all 82 games for the first time in his career and averaged 12.0 ppg, 4.90 rpg, and 2.3 apg, scoring 27 points and 10 rebounds in the Suns' season finale.\n\nOn July 10, 2009, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Hill decided to re-sign with the Phoenix Suns for a 2-year deal, despite an offer from the [[2009\u201310 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] for the full mid-level exception and the [[2009\u201310 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] offering Hill the bi-annual exception.<ref>Aldridge, David.

It is the county town of [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]], one of the three authorities that replaced the old Dublin County Council.\n \nThe town was built following the 1816 legislation that allowed the building of a major port to serve Dublin. It was known as Dunleary until it was renamed '''Kingstown''' in honour of King [[George IV]]'s 1821 visit, and in 1920 was given its present name, the original Irish form of Dunleary. Over time, the town became a residential location, a seaside resort and the terminus of Ireland's first railway.\n\n==Toponymy==\n[[File:Ard Ri Laoghaire.jpg|thumb|100px|L\u00f3egaire from a stained glass window in the Maritime Museum]]\n\nThe town's name means \"fort of Laoghaire\".{{sfnp|Pearson|1981|p=13}} This refers to [[L\u00f3egaire mac N\u00e9ill]] (modern spelling: Laoghaire Mac N\u00e9ill), a 5th-century [[High King of Ireland]], who chose the site as a sea base from which to carry out raids on [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]] and [[Gaul]]. Traces of fortifications from that time have been found on the coast, and some of the stone is kept in the [[National Maritime Museum of Ireland|Maritime Museum]].\n\nThe name is officially spelt '''D\u00fan Laoghaire''' in modern Irish orthography; sometimes unofficially '''D\u00fan Laoire'''.<ref name=altspellings>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunlaoghaire.ie/dun-laoire-dun-leary-or-dun-laoghaire-how-the-harbour-town-got-its-name/|title=Dun Laoire?

A Map of 1728 shows a small fishing village at the old harbour, marked as ''Dunlary'' or in other later maps as ''Dunleary''.{{Sfnp|Pearson|1981|pp=13\u201315}}  The earlier village was around the area where the Purty Kitchen pub is now (sometimes mapped as \"Old Dunleary\").  It had a coffee house and a small cove, both of which are shown on a number of old maps, and it may have had a salt mine (Salthill is close by). At that time, the area was a craggy, rocky pasture with some quarries.{{sfnp|Harbour Company|2003|pp=2\u20133}}\n\n[[File:The harbour in Kingstown, Co. Dublin, Ireland, in about 1895 - Option 2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Harbour in D\u00fan Laoghaire, then known as Kingstown, in about 1895]]\nAround 1800, some maps show a small town centre along what is now Cumberland Street, close to the junction with York Road. On the night of 18\u201319 November 1807, two troopships, the [[The Sinking of the Rochdale and the Prince of Wales|''Prince of Wales'', and the ''Rochdale'']], which had departed from Dublin, were driven on the rocks between Blackrock and D\u00fan Laoghaire with the loss of over 400 lives. This disaster gave new impetus to an existing campaign for a harbour to be constructed near Dublin. By 1816, the legislation was passed authorising the construction of what is now called the \"West Pier\". The lines of the current town centre including George's Street and most adjoining streets are clearly shown on maps prepared for the development of the harbour, and in particular on a John Rennie plan of 1817, when construction of that town centre had barely commenced at the western end of George's Street. That street may originally have been laid out as a military road connecting the D\u00fan Laoghaire Martello Towers\u2014one at the [[People's Park, D\u00fan Laoghaire|Peoples Park]], the other near the end of the West Pier\u2014both of which have long disappeared. Whatever its origins, the street was clearly an engineer's design, being ruler-straight for all of its length (except the small western part which clearly pre-dates 1816). When [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] came to visit the new port under construction in 1821, the name Dunleary was dropped in favour of \"Kingstown\"; the town returned to its former name in 1920, in the lead-up to the creation of the [[Irish Free State]]. By the time the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland|Ordnance Survey]] was completed around 1845, the maps show buildings on much of the street and adjacent streets.\n\nIreland's first railway from Dublin to Kingstown, opened in 1834, terminated near the West Pier. It established Kingstown as a preferred suburb of [[Dublin]] and led to the construction of residential terraces. By 1844 the [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway|Atmospheric Train]] (designed by [[Robert Mallet]]) connected Kingstown to Dalkey, leading to further development. The Atmospheric Train ceased in 1854 but was replaced by the extension of the railway, which was subsequently extended to the ferry port of [[Rosslare Harbour|Rosslare]]. The opening of the railway from Dublin saw Kingstown become a [[Victorian era]] [[seaside resort]].\n\nIn 1890, the Kingstown Town Commissioners established the [[People's Park, D\u00fan Laoghaire|People's Park]] on the site of a depleted quarry. By 1900, the centre of the town was congested and steps were taken to widen the street. These steps included the demolition of shop frontages on George's Street from Patrick Street to Mulgrave Street, and their replacement by new frontages stepped back about 5 yards (4.5m). Shops on the corner of Marine Road and George's Street were also demolished.\n\nThe main road to Dublin, through [[Monkstown, County Dublin|Monkstown village]] and [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], was the sole road connection to the city of Dublin until 1932. In that year, the [[Eucharistic Congress]] brought thousands of visitors to Dublin, and plans indicated that most of them would come through D\u00fan Laoghaire. The road was considered inadequate, and a new coast road was created by connecting some short segments of road and closing some gardens. This road is now Seapoint Avenue. An agreement with the local residents to restore the area to the pre-Congress condition was never fulfilled.\n\nThe British [[59th (2nd North Midland) Division]] disembarked at Kingstown in April 1916 and marched up the road to Dublin, to participate in the [[Easter Rising]]. Adjacent to the [[Carlisle Pier]] and overlooked by the National Maritime Museum of Ireland, there is an anchor, recovered from the wreck of the mailboat {{RMS|Leinster}} which was torpedoed over the [[Kish Bank]] in 1918, with the loss of over 500 lives.\n\nD\u00fan Laoghaire was hit by stray [[Luftwaffe|German bombs]] during the [[Second World War]], with a couple of them landing near the People's Park at Rosmeen Gardens. Damage from the bombs was limited to buildings.\n\n==Governance and representation==\n[[File:Dun Laoghaire Aerial.jpg|thumb|D\u00fan Laoghaire and port from the air.]]\nD\u00fan Laoghaire was once the core element of the [[Corporation of D\u00fan Laoghaire|borough of D\u00fan Laoghaire]], and until 2013 remained the only town in Ireland to have its own [[Vocational Education Committee]]. It is considered part of the [[Greater Dublin Area]].\n\nThe area is governed locally by [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown County Council]] which is based at [[County Hall, D\u00fan Laoghaire|County Hall]] and is responsible for the provision of local services and amenities. For elections, the town is part of the D\u00fan Laoghaire [[local electoral area]] which elects six councillors.\n\nFor elections to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] the town is part of the [[D\u00fan Laoghaire (D\u00e1il constituency)|D\u00fan Laoghaire]] constituency which is currently represented by four [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s; three from [[Fine Gael]] and one from [[People Before Profit]]. The former [[T\u00e1naiste]], [[Eamon Gilmore]], who resides in [[Shankill, Dublin|Shankill]] to the south, was one of the TDs from the constituency between 1989 and 2016.\n\n==Features==\nThe harbour, one of the largest in the country, is notable for its two granite piers. The East Pier is particularly popular with walkers, and was featured in the 1996 film ''[[Michael Collins (film)|Michael Collins]]'', where [[Liam Neeson]] (as Collins) and two of his co-stars are seen walking along a seaside [[Esplanade|promenade]], which is actually the D\u00fan Laoghaire East Pier. A band is seen playing on a [[bandstand]] in this film scene, and this is the actual bandstand on the East Pier. The bandstand was restored to its original condition in 2010 by the D\u00fan Laoghaire Harbour Company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/sports-recreation/postcards-of-ireland/postcards-of-dun-laoghair/dun-laoghaire-rathdown-an/kingstown-(dun-laoghaire)/|title=Kingstown (Dun Laoghaire) Harbour|website=www.askaboutireland.ie|accessdate=1 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205130309/http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/sports-recreation/postcards-of-ireland/postcards-of-dun-laoghair/dun-laoghaire-rathdown-an/kingstown-(dun-laoghaire)/|archivedate=5 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt took 42 years to construct the harbour, from 1817 to 1859.

The 746 bus route from the station terminus to [[Dublin Airport]] was discontinued in October 2010. [[Sandycove and Glasthule railway station|Sandycove and Glasthule]] and [[Salthill and Monkstown railway station|Salthill and Monkstown]] also serve the area.\n\nAn [[Aircoach]] service links the area with Dublin Airport 24 hours a day with stops at County Hall and the Royal Marine Hotel.

Extension southward was by the standard gauge [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway]] publicly opened in 1844 which was the first railway to have practical and commercial application of [[Atmospheric railway|pneumatic]] power.  In the 1850s, the [[Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway|Dublin and Wicklow Railway]] took over both lines, converting both to [[Irish gauge]] and the latter to [[steam locomotive]] haulage whilst extending further south to [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], [[Wicklow]].  Successor companies operating the railway were: [[Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway]]; [[Dublin and South Eastern Railway]]; [[Great Southern Railways]]; [[CI\u00c9]]; and [[Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann]].  An extension to [[Carlisle Pier]] for the boats operated from 1859 until 1980.  The railway was subsequently extended to the south to [[Wexford]], [[Rosslare Harbour]] and [[Waterford]]. Northwards in 1890 the line was extended to [[Connolly station]] connecting to other railways.{{Sfnp|Shepherd|1974|pp=13\u201315, 24\u201330, 36, 38, 42, 47, 58\u201359, 93, 96}}  Electrification arrived in 1984, and the electrified suburban service was branded as [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]]. There are also [[Dublin Bus]] and [[Go-Ahead Ireland]] (since September 2018) services that operate near the station as well as around D\u00fan Laoghaire.\n\n===Ferry===\nFrom the 19th century, the town was the principal passenger port for ferries between Ireland and Britain, with a frequent service to [[Holyhead]] in [[Isle of Anglesey|Anglesey]], Wales. Among the ships which operated this route were \"Banshee\", \"Llewellyn\", \"Ulster\", \"Munster\", \"Leinster\", \"Connaught\", \"[[MV Cambria (1949)|MV Cambria]]\", \"[[MV Hibernia (1949)|MV Hibernia]]\", \"[[TSS Princess Maud (1934)|Princess Maud]]\",<ref name=\"NoStabilisersUpNdown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/BRPrincessMaud.html|website=Simplon Postcards|access-date=4 February 2018|title=Princess Maud - Venus|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929060607/http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/BRPrincessMaud.html|archivedate=29 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \"Holyhead Ferry 1\", \"St. Columba\" and \"Stena Cambria\".<ref>History of Dun Laoghaire Harbour by John de Courcy Ireland</ref> At the beginning of the 21st century the route, operated by [[Stena Line]]'s [[Stena Explorer]] ran three times daily in each direction, but competition from low-cost airlines and increasing fuel costs resulted in the service being reduced to once-daily in 2008, and becoming a seasonal (summer-only plus Christmas/New Year) from 2010.

Bus routes coming along this road into D\u00fan Laoghaire were re-routed along the seafront.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} This restriction was reversed in late 2008. Many of the local residents{{Who|date=February 2010}} felt that [[Dundrum Town Centre|Dundrum Shopping Centre]], which opened a mere 20 minutes drive from D\u00fan Laoghaire was the major contributory factor to the \"downturn\" and were disappointed that the pedestrianisation was never implemented seriously by the local authorities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} D\u00fan Laoghaire Business Association attributed the downturn to high parking charges.

The offshore boat is normally moored adjoining the Carlisle Pier. The inshore boat is stored in a stone shed at the base of the East Pier.

This was the first time in yachting history that all the boats in a race should be identical, and that the winner would be the man with the greatest skill. This concept of 'One-design' has become the norm worldwide and has been adopted for all Olympic sailing events and for most World Championships in sailing. The Water Wag club prospers some 127 years later, and 'Wags' can be seen sailing in D\u00fan Laoghaire harbour on Wednesday evenings from late April to mid-September every year.\n\n===Marina===\nThe 820-berth marina is the largest in the country, and opened in 2001 following resistance for over 15 years by a group led by the late [[John de Courcy Ireland]], the maritime historian. A 240-berth extension, involving an investment of \u20ac3&nbsp;million, was approved in June 2006 by [[An Bord Plean\u00e1la]]; the project was completed in April 2007.

It is the county town of [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]], one of the three authorities that replaced the old Dublin County Council.\n \nThe town was built following the 1816 legislation that allowed the building of a major port to serve Dublin. It was known as Dunleary until it was renamed '''Kingstown''' in honour of King [[George IV]]'s 1821 visit, and in 1920 was given its present name, the original Irish form of Dunleary. Over time, the town became a residential location, a seaside resort and the terminus of Ireland's first railway.\n\n==Toponymy==\n[[File:Ard Ri Laoghaire.jpg|thumb|100px|L\u00f3egaire from a stained glass window in the Maritime Museum]]\n\nThe town's name means \"fort of Laoghaire\".{{sfnp|Pearson|1981|p=13}} This refers to [[L\u00f3egaire mac N\u00e9ill]] (modern spelling: Laoghaire Mac N\u00e9ill), a 5th-century [[High King of Ireland]], who chose the site as a sea base from which to carry out raids on [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]] and [[Gaul]].

A Map of 1728 shows a small fishing village at the old harbour, marked as ''Dunlary'' or in other later maps as ''Dunleary''.{{Sfnp|Pearson|1981|pp=13\u201315}}  The earlier village was around the area where the Purty Kitchen pub is now (sometimes mapped as \"Old Dunleary\").  It had a coffee house and a small cove, both of which are shown on a number of old maps, and it may have had a salt mine (Salthill is close by). At that time, the area was a craggy, rocky pasture with some quarries.{{sfnp|Harbour Company|2003|pp=2\u20133}}\n\n[[File:The harbour in Kingstown, Co. Dublin, Ireland, in about 1895 - Option 2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Harbour in D\u00fan Laoghaire, then known as Kingstown, in about 1895]]\nAround 1800, some maps show a small town centre along what is now Cumberland Street, close to the junction with York Road. On the night of 18\u201319 November 1807, two troopships, the [[The Sinking of the Rochdale and the Prince of Wales|''Prince of Wales'', and the ''Rochdale'']], which had departed from Dublin, were driven on the rocks between Blackrock and D\u00fan Laoghaire with the loss of over 400 lives. This disaster gave new impetus to an existing campaign for a harbour to be constructed near Dublin. By 1816, the legislation was passed authorising the construction of what is now called the \"West Pier\". The lines of the current town centre including George's Street and most adjoining streets are clearly shown on maps prepared for the development of the harbour, and in particular on a John Rennie plan of 1817, when construction of that town centre had barely commenced at the western end of George's Street. That street may originally have been laid out as a military road connecting the D\u00fan Laoghaire Martello Towers\u2014one at the [[People's Park, D\u00fan Laoghaire|Peoples Park]], the other near the end of the West Pier\u2014both of which have long disappeared. Whatever its origins, the street was clearly an engineer's design, being ruler-straight for all of its length (except the small western part which clearly pre-dates 1816). When [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] came to visit the new port under construction in 1821, the name Dunleary was dropped in favour of \"Kingstown\"; the town returned to its former name in 1920, in the lead-up to the creation of the [[Irish Free State]]. By the time the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland|Ordnance Survey]] was completed around 1845, the maps show buildings on much of the street and adjacent streets.\n\nIreland's first railway from Dublin to Kingstown, opened in 1834, terminated near the West Pier. It established Kingstown as a preferred suburb of [[Dublin]] and led to the construction of residential terraces. By 1844 the [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway|Atmospheric Train]] (designed by [[Robert Mallet]]) connected Kingstown to Dalkey, leading to further development. The Atmospheric Train ceased in 1854 but was replaced by the extension of the railway, which was subsequently extended to the ferry port of [[Rosslare Harbour|Rosslare]]. The opening of the railway from Dublin saw Kingstown become a [[Victorian era]] [[seaside resort]].\n\nIn 1890, the Kingstown Town Commissioners established the [[People's Park, D\u00fan Laoghaire|People's Park]] on the site of a depleted quarry. By 1900, the centre of the town was congested and steps were taken to widen the street. These steps included the demolition of shop frontages on George's Street from Patrick Street to Mulgrave Street, and their replacement by new frontages stepped back about 5 yards (4.5m). Shops on the corner of Marine Road and George's Street were also demolished.\n\nThe main road to Dublin, through [[Monkstown, County Dublin|Monkstown village]] and [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], was the sole road connection to the city of Dublin until 1932. In that year, the [[Eucharistic Congress]] brought thousands of visitors to Dublin, and plans indicated that most of them would come through D\u00fan Laoghaire. The road was considered inadequate, and a new coast road was created by connecting some short segments of road and closing some gardens. This road is now Seapoint Avenue. An agreement with the local residents to restore the area to the pre-Congress condition was never fulfilled.\n\nThe British [[59th (2nd North Midland) Division]] disembarked at Kingstown in April 1916 and marched up the road to Dublin, to participate in the [[Easter Rising]]. Adjacent to the [[Carlisle Pier]] and overlooked by the National Maritime Museum of Ireland, there is an anchor, recovered from the wreck of the mailboat {{RMS|Leinster}} which was torpedoed over the [[Kish Bank]] in 1918, with the loss of over 500 lives.\n\nD\u00fan Laoghaire was hit by stray [[Luftwaffe|German bombs]] during the [[Second World War]], with a couple of them landing near the People's Park at Rosmeen Gardens. Damage from the bombs was limited to buildings.\n\n==Governance and representation==\n[[File:Dun Laoghaire Aerial.jpg|thumb|D\u00fan Laoghaire and port from the air.]]\nD\u00fan Laoghaire was once the core element of the [[Corporation of D\u00fan Laoghaire|borough of D\u00fan Laoghaire]], and until 2013 remained the only town in Ireland to have its own [[Vocational Education Committee]]. It is considered part of the [[Greater Dublin Area]].\n\nThe area is governed locally by [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown County Council]] which is based at [[County Hall, D\u00fan Laoghaire|County Hall]] and is responsible for the provision of local services and amenities. For elections, the town is part of the D\u00fan Laoghaire [[local electoral area]] which elects six councillors.\n\nFor elections to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] the town is part of the [[D\u00fan Laoghaire (D\u00e1il constituency)|D\u00fan Laoghaire]] constituency which is currently represented by four [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s; three from [[Fine Gael]] and one from [[People Before Profit]]. The former [[T\u00e1naiste]], [[Eamon Gilmore]], who resides in [[Shankill, Dublin|Shankill]] to the south, was one of the TDs from the constituency between 1989 and 2016.\n\n==Features==\nThe harbour, one of the largest in the country, is notable for its two granite piers. The East Pier is particularly popular with walkers, and was featured in the 1996 film ''[[Michael Collins (film)|Michael Collins]]'', where [[Liam Neeson]] (as Collins) and two of his co-stars are seen walking along a seaside [[Esplanade|promenade]], which is actually the D\u00fan Laoghaire East Pier. A band is seen playing on a [[bandstand]] in this film scene, and this is the actual bandstand on the East Pier. The bandstand was restored to its original condition in 2010 by the D\u00fan Laoghaire Harbour Company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/sports-recreation/postcards-of-ireland/postcards-of-dun-laoghair/dun-laoghaire-rathdown-an/kingstown-(dun-laoghaire)/|title=Kingstown (Dun Laoghaire) Harbour|website=www.askaboutireland.ie|accessdate=1 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205130309/http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/sports-recreation/postcards-of-ireland/postcards-of-dun-laoghair/dun-laoghaire-rathdown-an/kingstown-(dun-laoghaire)/|archivedate=5 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt took 42 years to construct the harbour, from 1817 to 1859.

Extension southward was by the standard gauge [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway]] publicly opened in 1844 which was the first railway to have practical and commercial application of [[Atmospheric railway|pneumatic]] power.  In the 1850s, the [[Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway|Dublin and Wicklow Railway]] took over both lines, converting both to [[Irish gauge]] and the latter to [[steam locomotive]] haulage whilst extending further south to [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], [[Wicklow]].  Successor companies operating the railway were: [[Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway]]; [[Dublin and South Eastern Railway]]; [[Great Southern Railways]]; [[CI\u00c9]]; and [[Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann]].  An extension to [[Carlisle Pier]] for the boats operated from 1859 until 1980.  The railway was subsequently extended to the south to [[Wexford]], [[Rosslare Harbour]] and [[Waterford]]. Northwards in 1890 the line was extended to [[Connolly station]] connecting to other railways.{{Sfnp|Shepherd|1974|pp=13\u201315, 24\u201330, 36, 38, 42, 47, 58\u201359, 93, 96}}  Electrification arrived in 1984, and the electrified suburban service was branded as [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]].

Amrozi, [[Joni Hendrawan|Idris]] and Ali Imron had simply walked into a dealership and purchased a new [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber to put on his explosives vest and the other to arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy's Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive the minivan the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris dialed the number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike at a place where it eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\"\n|- style=\"background: #E9E9E9;\"\n!

He is believed to have assisted the Bali bomber [[Amrozi]] in acquiring some of the explosives used in the Bali bombings. Philippine intelligence considers Munandar to be associated with Mohammad Abdullah Sughayer, a Saudi national [[Abu Sayyaf]] Group in southern Philippines. Munandar is still at large. A report by the [[United States-Indonesia Society]] describes the arrest of Amrozi and other suspects.<ref>[http://www.usindo.org/publications/reports/pdf/WarOnTerror.pdf Indonesia's War on Terror] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326213002/http://www.usindo.org/publications/reports/pdf/WarOnTerror.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }}, by William M. Wise, Published by the United States\u2013Indonesia Society, August 2005</ref>\n<blockquote>General Pastika ordered his men to make the arrest early the next morning, November. Amrozi was asleep in the rear of the house. According to Greg Barton<nowiki>'s account, Amrozi did not attempt to escape, but laughed instead, later exclaiming,\n''</nowiki>''Gosh, you guys are very clever, how did you find me?\"'' Amrozi's mobile phone, a particularly important piece of evidence, was seized during his arrest. Bags of chemical ingredients for bombs were found in his workshop and [[Soil test|soil samples]] taken from outside his home showed traces of the primary chemical used in the Sari Club bomb. Police found [[receipt]]s for the purchase of chemicals used to make the bombs, as well as a list of expenses incurred in making the bombs. Further search of Amrozi's home revealed copies of speeches by Osama bin Laden, and Abu Bakar Bashir, the radical Indonesian Muslim cleric reputed to be the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah. The speeches exhorted listeners to wage [[jihad]]. Police also uncovered training manuals on [[ambush]] techniques and numerous articles on jihad. Under questioning Amrozi revealed the names of six others involved in the bombing: Ali Imron, Imam Samudra, Dul Matin, Idris, Abdul Ghani and Umar Patek. But Amrozi's mobile phone proved to be the real catch. Indonesian investigators were able to print out a list of calls he had made immediately before, during and after the bombing, as well as the names and [[telephone number]]s in the phone's memory. Pastika kept Amrozi's arrest secret for two days. After it was announced, Polri monitored the sudden flurry of communications among numbers listed in Amrozi's telephone before the calls abruptly ceased. The investigators were able to identify the location of a number of the telephones, leading to a series of arrests.</blockquote>\n\nIndonesian authorities also believe more suspects remain at large. In 2005, Indonesian police arrested 24 additional people suspected of involvement in the Bali attacks and a [[2003 Marriott Hotel bombing|2003 bombing of the Marriott Hotel]] in [[Jakarta]].\n\nOn 12 October 2005, a story in Australian broadcaster [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]'s documentary series ''[[Dateline (Australian TV program)|Dateline]]'', called \"Inside Indonesia's War on Terrorism\", argued that the [[Military of Indonesia|Indonesian military]] or police may have been involved in executing the attack.<ref>\"Scoop\" Independent News [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0510/S00223.htm SBS Documentary: Inside Indonesia's War on Terror] ''[[scoop.co.nz]]''</ref>\n\nOn 13 June 2007, it was reported that [[Abu Dujana (Jemaah Islamiah)|Abu Dujana]], who might have headed a [[clandestine cell system|terrorist cell]] in Bali, was captured.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3274889 Report on capture by ABC News] ''[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]''  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018091104/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3274889 |date=18 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nJust past midnight on 9 November 2008, the three convicted of carrying out the bombings (Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim, and Ali Ghufron) were executed by a firing squad.\n\n[[Umar Patek]] was finally arrested in [[Abbottabad]] Pakistan in early 2011.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12900555 Bali bombing suspect Umar Patek 'arrested in Pakistan'], BBC, 30 March 2011</ref> The U.S. government had offered a US$1 million reward for his arrest. Patek is a suspect in other bombings as well as the one in Bali.\n\n==Legal proceedings==\n\n===Initial charges and trials===\nIn April 2003, Indonesian authorities charged [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] (also rendered \"Ba'asyir\"), the alleged spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, with [[treason]]. It was alleged that he tried to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic state. The specific charges against Bashir related to a series of [[Christmas Eve 2000 Indonesia terror attacks|church bombings]] on Christmas Eve in 2000, and to a plot to bomb United States and other Western interests in [[Singapore]]. He was initially not charged over the Bali attack, although he was frequently accused of being the instigator or inspirer of the attack. On 2 September, Bashir was acquitted of treason but convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to a prison term of four years. He said he would appeal. On 15 October 2004, he was arrested by the Indonesian authorities and charged with involvement in another bomb attack, which killed 14 people at the J. W. Marriott hotel in [[Jakarta]] on 5 August 2003. Secondary charges in this indictment accused him of involvement in the Bali bombing, the first time he faced charges in relation to this attack. On 3 March 2005, Bashir was found not guilty of the charges surrounding the 2003 bombing, but guilty of conspiracy over the 2002 attacks in Bali. He was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. The Australian, US, and many governments expressed its disappointment that the sentence was too short; in the outcome, Bashir was freed 14 June 2006 having served less than 26 months for his conspiracy,<ref>The Age newspaper [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/bashirs-release-a-cause-of-great-pain-howard/2006/06/14/1149964605731.html Bashir's release a cause of great pain]</ref> and on 21 December 2006, Bashir's conviction was overturned by Indonesia's Supreme Court.\n\nOn 30 April 2003, the first charges related to the Bali bombings were made against Amrozi bin Haji Nurhasyim, known as Amrozi, for allegedly buying the explosives and the van used in the bombings. On 8 August, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Another participant in the bombing, [[Imam Samudra]], was sentenced to death on 10 September. Amrozi's brother, Ali Imron, who had expressed remorse for his part in the bombing, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 18 September. A fourth accused, [[Mukhlas|Ali Ghufron]], the brother-in-law of [[Noordin Mohammed Top]] was sentenced to death on 1 October. Ali Ghufron, alias Mukhlas, told police that he was the head of one of Jemaah Islamiyah's four cells and had ordered the Bali bombings. He also confessed that a fellow leader Riduan Isamuddin, known as Hambali, had provided the funds for the attacks. He told police, <blockquote>''I do not know for sure the source of the aforementioned money from Hambali; most probably it was from [[Afghanistan]], that is, from Sheikh Usama bin Laden. As far as I know, Hambali did not have a source of funds except from Afghanistan.''</blockquote> Another operative, Wan Min bin Wan Mat, revealed to police that he had given Mukhlas money, at Hambali's request and that he understood part of the money had come directly from al-Qaeda.\n\nAs noted below, all three were executed on 9 November 2008.\nThe Australian, US, and many other foreign governments expressed satisfaction with the speed and efficiency with which the Indonesian police and courts dealt with the bombings primary suspects, despite what they characterized as light sentences. All Australian jurisdictions abolished the death penalty more than 30 years ago, but a poll<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/news/speeches/death-penalty-matter-principle|title=The Death Penalty - a matter of principle|last=admin|date=2012-12-14|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref> showed that 77% of Australians approved of the death sentence for Amrozi. The Australian government said it would not ask Indonesia to refrain from using the death penalty.\n\nOn 15 August, [[Riduan Isamuddin]], generally known as Hambali, described as the operational chief of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] was arrested in Ayutthaya, Thailand, the old capital one hour's drive north of [[Bangkok]]. He is in American custody in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].\n\n===Constitutional appeals===\nOn 23 July 2004, one of the convicted bombers, [[Masykur Abdul Kadir|Maskur Abdul Kadir]], successfully appealed his conviction. He had been tried under retroactive laws which were introduced after the bombing and which were employed to aid the prosecution of those involved in the attack. These laws were used by the prosecution instead of existing criminal laws as they allowed the death penalty to be imposed and lowered certain evidentiary restrictions.\n\nThe highest court in Indonesia, the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Constitutional Court]], found by a margin of five to four that trying the terrorist suspects under these retroactive laws violated Article 28I(1) of the [[Constitution of Indonesia|constitution]] [2]. The minority judges argued that international human rights documents such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] allowed an exception to not applying retrospective legislation in the prosecution of crimes against humanity. The majority found that this argument was inconsistent with the text of Article 28I(1) which states that the rights listed there \"cannot be limited under any circumstances.\"\n\n[[File:Ex-paddys.jpg|thumb|right|The bombing site and memorial in September 2007]]\n\nFollowing this decision, charges related to the bombings against Idris, who had confessed to participating in the attacks to the police and court, were dismissed. The legal status of Kadir, Idris and others who might have their convictions quashed following the ruling on the retrospective law is unclear.\n\nThe Constitutional Court is a relatively new body, created after the fall of [[Suharto]], and this decision was one of the first to overrule the constitutionality of the government's application of a law.\n\n===Execution of perpetrators===\nOn 24 October 2008, Bali officials announced that three men convicted of carrying out the bombings would be executed by firing squad in November 2008.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/10/24/bali.executions/index.html?iref=topnews Bali bombers' executions set for November], 24 October 2008 \u2013 CNN.com</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Michelle Cazzulino\n|title=Relieved Bali bombing victims want chapter closed\n|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK\n|date=30 October 2008\n|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24573604-5001021,00.html\n| accessdate=8 November 2008 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n |author=AAP \n |title=Bali bombers already brought to justice, Kevin Rudd says \n |work=The Daily Telegraph \n |location=UK \n |date=30 October 2008 \n |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,,24575384-5001028,00.html \n |accessdate=8 November 2008 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207020211/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0%2C%2C24575384-5001028%2C00.html \n |archivedate=7 December 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> On 25 October 2008, Communications and Information Minister asked the Indonesian media to stop calling the three \"heroes\".<ref>{{cite news|date=25 October 2008|title=Minister Asks Media not to Call Amrozi Et Al: \"Heroes\"|work=[[Antara (news agency)|Antara News]]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Denpasar]] District Court, on 3 November, accepted a [[Clemency#Related concepts|reprieve]] motion to reconsider the death sentences.<ref>\"[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24594228-601,00.html New twist in Bali bombers' execution ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106131832/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24594228-601,00.html |date=6 November 2008 }}\" ''[[The Australian]]''</ref><ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7705493.stm New appeal filed for Bali bombers ]\" ''[[BBC News]]''</ref> Fahmi Bachmid, a lawyer for the family of Jafar Sodiq, a brother of Amrozi and Mukhlas, stated: \"We lodged the judicial review to Denpasar court to question (previous) decisions.\" Lawyer Imam Asmara Hadi stated: \"We have lodged an appeal because we haven't received a copy of the Supreme Court rejection of our previous appeal.\"\n\nIndonesia's Supreme Court denied previous petitions for [[judicial review]] amid the constitutional court's dismissal of the bombers' appeals.

The memorial is made of intricately carved stone, set with a large marble plaque, which bears the names and nationalities of each of those killed. It is flanked by the national flags of the victims. The monument is well-maintained and illuminated at night.\n\nThe memorial was dedicated on 12 October 2004, the second anniversary of the attack. The dedication included a Balinese Hindu ceremony and the opportunity for mourners to lay flowers and other offerings. The Australian ambassador and Indonesian officials attended the ceremony.\n\nThe Balinese mark their commitment in a nine-day-long event. After major cleansing ceremonies, establishing a memorial for the lost lives, and paying respect to those who left loved ones behind, the people of Kuta look forward to restoring Bali's image through an event named \"Kuta Karnival&nbsp;\u2014 A Celebration of Life\". The community event consists of traditional art performances such as Balinese Sunset Dances, sports on the beach as well as in the water for young and old plus rows and rows of culinary displays along the one kilometre of sandy beach.\n\nIn line with the return of tourism to Kuta, Kuta Karnival has grown into a tourism promotional event with major coverage from television and newspapers from across the globe. Companies, embassies, Non-Government Organizations, associations and even individuals come forth to get involved in the various events such as a Balinese dance competition presented by a surf-wear company, an environment exhibition presented by an embassy, a fun cycle presented by a group of individuals, a seminar presented by an association and a parade on the streets presented by an NGO. Tourists and locals alike, more than ninety thousand people participates in the numerous events, year after year.\n\nA repeated [[2005 Bali bombings|tragedy in Bali in 2005]] did not reduce the Kuta community's determination to carry out this annual event.

Amrozi, [[Joni Hendrawan|Idris]] and Ali Imron had simply walked into a dealership and purchased a new [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber to put on his explosives vest and the other to arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy's Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive the minivan the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris dialed the number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike at a place where it eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\"\n|- style=\"background: #E9E9E9;\"\n!

He is believed to have assisted the Bali bomber [[Amrozi]] in acquiring some of the explosives used in the Bali bombings. Philippine intelligence considers Munandar to be associated with Mohammad Abdullah Sughayer, a Saudi national [[Abu Sayyaf]] Group in southern Philippines. Munandar is still at large. A report by the [[United States-Indonesia Society]] describes the arrest of Amrozi and other suspects.<ref>[http://www.usindo.org/publications/reports/pdf/WarOnTerror.pdf Indonesia's War on Terror] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326213002/http://www.usindo.org/publications/reports/pdf/WarOnTerror.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }}, by William M.

Amrozi was asleep in the rear of the house. According to Greg Barton<nowiki>'s account, Amrozi did not attempt to escape, but laughed instead, later exclaiming,\n''</nowiki>''Gosh, you guys are very clever, how did you find me?\"'' Amrozi's mobile phone, a particularly important piece of evidence, was seized during his arrest. Bags of chemical ingredients for bombs were found in his workshop and [[Soil test|soil samples]] taken from outside his home showed traces of the primary chemical used in the Sari Club bomb. Police found [[receipt]]s for the purchase of chemicals used to make the bombs, as well as a list of expenses incurred in making the bombs. Further search of Amrozi's home revealed copies of speeches by Osama bin Laden, and Abu Bakar Bashir, the radical Indonesian Muslim cleric reputed to be the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah. The speeches exhorted listeners to wage [[jihad]]. Police also uncovered training manuals on [[ambush]] techniques and numerous articles on jihad. Under questioning Amrozi revealed the names of six others involved in the bombing: Ali Imron, Imam Samudra, Dul Matin, Idris, Abdul Ghani and Umar Patek. But Amrozi's mobile phone proved to be the real catch. Indonesian investigators were able to print out a list of calls he had made immediately before, during and after the bombing, as well as the names and [[telephone number]]s in the phone's memory. Pastika kept Amrozi's arrest secret for two days. After it was announced, Polri monitored the sudden flurry of communications among numbers listed in Amrozi's telephone before the calls abruptly ceased. The investigators were able to identify the location of a number of the telephones, leading to a series of arrests.</blockquote>\n\nIndonesian authorities also believe more suspects remain at large. In 2005, Indonesian police arrested 24 additional people suspected of involvement in the Bali attacks and a [[2003 Marriott Hotel bombing|2003 bombing of the Marriott Hotel]] in [[Jakarta]].\n\nOn 12 October 2005, a story in Australian broadcaster [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]'s documentary series ''[[Dateline (Australian TV program)|Dateline]]'', called \"Inside Indonesia's War on Terrorism\", argued that the [[Military of Indonesia|Indonesian military]] or police may have been involved in executing the attack.<ref>\"Scoop\" Independent News [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0510/S00223.htm SBS Documentary: Inside Indonesia's War on Terror] ''[[scoop.co.nz]]''</ref>\n\nOn 13 June 2007, it was reported that [[Abu Dujana (Jemaah Islamiah)|Abu Dujana]], who might have headed a [[clandestine cell system|terrorist cell]] in Bali, was captured.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3274889 Report on capture by ABC News] ''[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]''  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018091104/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3274889 |date=18 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nJust past midnight on 9 November 2008, the three convicted of carrying out the bombings (Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim, and Ali Ghufron) were executed by a firing squad.\n\n[[Umar Patek]] was finally arrested in [[Abbottabad]] Pakistan in early 2011.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12900555 Bali bombing suspect Umar Patek 'arrested in Pakistan'], BBC, 30 March 2011</ref> The U.S. government had offered a US$1 million reward for his arrest. Patek is a suspect in other bombings as well as the one in Bali.\n\n==Legal proceedings==\n\n===Initial charges and trials===\nIn April 2003, Indonesian authorities charged [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] (also rendered \"Ba'asyir\"), the alleged spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, with [[treason]]. It was alleged that he tried to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic state. The specific charges against Bashir related to a series of [[Christmas Eve 2000 Indonesia terror attacks|church bombings]] on Christmas Eve in 2000, and to a plot to bomb United States and other Western interests in [[Singapore]]. He was initially not charged over the Bali attack, although he was frequently accused of being the instigator or inspirer of the attack. On 2 September, Bashir was acquitted of treason but convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to a prison term of four years. He said he would appeal. On 15 October 2004, he was arrested by the Indonesian authorities and charged with involvement in another bomb attack, which killed 14 people at the J. W. Marriott hotel in [[Jakarta]] on 5 August 2003. Secondary charges in this indictment accused him of involvement in the Bali bombing, the first time he faced charges in relation to this attack. On 3 March 2005, Bashir was found not guilty of the charges surrounding the 2003 bombing, but guilty of conspiracy over the 2002 attacks in Bali. He was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. The Australian, US, and many governments expressed its disappointment that the sentence was too short; in the outcome, Bashir was freed 14 June 2006 having served less than 26 months for his conspiracy,<ref>The Age newspaper [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/bashirs-release-a-cause-of-great-pain-howard/2006/06/14/1149964605731.html Bashir's release a cause of great pain]</ref> and on 21 December 2006, Bashir's conviction was overturned by Indonesia's Supreme Court.\n\nOn 30 April 2003, the first charges related to the Bali bombings were made against Amrozi bin Haji Nurhasyim, known as Amrozi, for allegedly buying the explosives and the van used in the bombings. On 8 August, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Another participant in the bombing, [[Imam Samudra]], was sentenced to death on 10 September. Amrozi's brother, Ali Imron, who had expressed remorse for his part in the bombing, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 18 September. A fourth accused, [[Mukhlas|Ali Ghufron]], the brother-in-law of [[Noordin Mohammed Top]] was sentenced to death on 1 October. Ali Ghufron, alias Mukhlas, told police that he was the head of one of Jemaah Islamiyah's four cells and had ordered the Bali bombings. He also confessed that a fellow leader Riduan Isamuddin, known as Hambali, had provided the funds for the attacks. He told police, <blockquote>''I do not know for sure the source of the aforementioned money from Hambali; most probably it was from [[Afghanistan]], that is, from Sheikh Usama bin Laden. As far as I know, Hambali did not have a source of funds except from Afghanistan.''</blockquote> Another operative, Wan Min bin Wan Mat, revealed to police that he had given Mukhlas money, at Hambali's request and that he understood part of the money had come directly from al-Qaeda.\n\nAs noted below, all three were executed on 9 November 2008.\nThe Australian, US, and many other foreign governments expressed satisfaction with the speed and efficiency with which the Indonesian police and courts dealt with the bombings primary suspects, despite what they characterized as light sentences. All Australian jurisdictions abolished the death penalty more than 30 years ago, but a poll<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/news/speeches/death-penalty-matter-principle|title=The Death Penalty - a matter of principle|last=admin|date=2012-12-14|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref> showed that 77% of Australians approved of the death sentence for Amrozi. The Australian government said it would not ask Indonesia to refrain from using the death penalty.\n\nOn 15 August, [[Riduan Isamuddin]], generally known as Hambali, described as the operational chief of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] was arrested in Ayutthaya, Thailand, the old capital one hour's drive north of [[Bangkok]]. He is in American custody in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].\n\n===Constitutional appeals===\nOn 23 July 2004, one of the convicted bombers, [[Masykur Abdul Kadir|Maskur Abdul Kadir]], successfully appealed his conviction. He had been tried under retroactive laws which were introduced after the bombing and which were employed to aid the prosecution of those involved in the attack. These laws were used by the prosecution instead of existing criminal laws as they allowed the death penalty to be imposed and lowered certain evidentiary restrictions.\n\nThe highest court in Indonesia, the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Constitutional Court]], found by a margin of five to four that trying the terrorist suspects under these retroactive laws violated Article 28I(1) of the [[Constitution of Indonesia|constitution]] [2].

After major cleansing ceremonies, establishing a memorial for the lost lives, and paying respect to those who left loved ones behind, the people of Kuta look forward to restoring Bali's image through an event named \"Kuta Karnival&nbsp;\u2014 A Celebration of Life\". The community event consists of traditional art performances such as Balinese Sunset Dances, sports on the beach as well as in the water for young and old plus rows and rows of culinary displays along the one kilometre of sandy beach.\n\nIn line with the return of tourism to Kuta, Kuta Karnival has grown into a tourism promotional event with major coverage from television and newspapers from across the globe. Companies, embassies, Non-Government Organizations, associations and even individuals come forth to get involved in the various events such as a Balinese dance competition presented by a surf-wear company, an environment exhibition presented by an embassy, a fun cycle presented by a group of individuals, a seminar presented by an association and a parade on the streets presented by an NGO.
