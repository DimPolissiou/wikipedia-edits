The novel takes place in the [[Netherlands]] and is a colorful fictional portrait of early 19th-century Dutch life, as well as a tale of youthful honor.\n\nThe book's title refers to the beautiful silver skates to be awarded to the winner of the [[Speed skating|ice-skating race]] Hans Brinker hopes to enter. The novel introduced the sport of Dutch [[speed skating]] to Americans, and in U.S. media Hans Brinker is still considered the prototypical speed skater.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/115902 \"It Beats Freezing To Death: America Gets Its First Indoor Speed-Skating Rink\"]. ''[[Newsweek]]''. January 3, 1993. Accessed August 15, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe book is also notable for popularizing the story of the little Dutch boy who plugs a [[levee|dike]] with his finger.\n\n==Overview==\n[[Mary Mapes Dodge]], who never visited the Netherlands until after the novel was published, wrote the novel at age 34.  She was inspired by her reading of [[John Lothrop Motley|John L. Motley]]'s lengthy, multi-volume history works: ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' (1856), and  ''History of the United Netherlands'' (1860\u20131867).<ref>Gannon, Susan R.; and Thomson, Ruth Anne. ''Mary Mapes Dodge''. Twayne Publishers, 1993; p. 10.</ref> Dodge subsequently did further bibliographical research into the country. She also received much firsthand information about Dutch life from her immigrant Dutch neighbors, the Scharffs,<ref name=\"Gannon, Susan R. p. 55\">Gannon, Susan R.; and Thomson, Ruth Anne. ''Mary Mapes Dodge''. Twayne Publishers, 1993; p. 55.</ref> and Dodge wrote in her preface to the 1875 edition of the book that the story of Hans Brinker's father was \"founded strictly upon fact\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8TsRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA9&ots=PlbleHItP2&dq=%22hans+brinker+or+The+Silver+Skates:+A+Life+in+Holland%22&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html Dodge, Mary Mapes. ''Hans Brinker; or, The Silver Skates: A Story of Life in Holland''. [[Scribners]]: 1886], p. 9.</ref> Even so, many of the story's characters have names that are morphologically German rather than Dutch, or are completely obscure.<ref>Some editions of the story contain a footnote explaining that \"Ludwig, Gretel, and Carl were named after German friends\" and correctly giving Lodewijk, Karel and Grietje as the Dutch-language equivalents. Other names that seem fictitious, such as \"Voost\", \"Broom\" or \"Rychie\", could be corruptions of existing Dutch forms (in this case \"Joost\", \"Bram\" and \"Riekie\"). See http://www.heardutchhere.net/HansBrinker2.html. In Dutch editions of the book, names and other elements were adapted to make the story more believable to Dutch children; hence, translator P.J. Andriessen renamed German-sounding \"Gretel\" to \"Griete\" in the first Dutch edition of 1867, and Margreet Bruijn changed the main characters' names to the authentically Dutch regional forms of \"Hannes\" and \"Geertje\" in her 1954 adaptation. See Janneke van der Veer, \"Mary Mapes Dodge\", in: Jan van Coillie, Wilma van der Pennen, Jos Staal & Herman Tromp (eds.), ''Lexicon van de jeugdliteratuur'' (Groningen, 1982-2014).</ref>\n\nFull of Dutch cultural and historical information, the book became an instant bestseller, outselling all other books in its first year of publication except [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]''.<ref name=\"Gannon, Susan R. p. 55\"/> The novel has since been continuously in print, most often in multiple editions and formats, and remains a children's classic.<ref>Morad, Deborah.

They have little chance of doing well on their handmade wooden skates, but the prospect of the race and the prize of the silver skates excites them and fires their dreams.\n\nHans' father, Raff Brinker, suffered [[head injury|head trauma]] when he fell from a [[Levee|dike]]. It left him chronically ill, with episodes of [[amnesia]] and occasional violent outbursts, so he is unable to work. Mrs.&nbsp;Brinker, Hans, and Gretel must all work to support the family and are looked down upon in the community because they are poor. By chance, Hans meets the famous surgeon Dr.&nbsp;Boekman and begs him to treat their father, but the doctor's fees are expensive and he has been very gruff following the death of his wife and disappearance of his son. Eventually, Dr.&nbsp;Boekman is persuaded to examine Mr.&nbsp;Brinker. He diagnoses pressure on the brain, which can be cured by a risky and expensive operation involving [[Trepanation|trephining]].\n\nHans earns money to buy Gretel a pair of steel skates for the race. Later, when he earns enough to buy himself a pair of skates, he instead offers the money to Doctor Boekman to pay for his father's operation. Touched by this gesture, Dr.&nbsp;Boekman provides the surgery for free, and Hans is able to buy good skates for himself to skate in the race. Hans sacrifices his opportunity to win the boys' race by dropping out of the race to help a friend win. Gretel wins the girls' race and the precious prize: the eponymous Silver Skates. \n\nMr.&nbsp;Brinker's operation is successful, and he is restored to health and memory. Dr.&nbsp;Boekman is also changed, losing his gruff demeanour when he is reunited with his lost son through the unexpected help of Mr.&nbsp;Brinker. The Brinkers' fortunes are changed further by the almost miraculous recovery of Mr.&nbsp;Brinker's savings, which had been thought lost or stolen ten years ago.\n\nThe Brinker parents live a long and happy life. Dr.&nbsp;Boekman helps Hans go to [[medical school]], and Hans becomes a successful doctor. Gretel also grows up to enjoy a happy adult life.\n\n==Film adaptations==\n''Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates'' has been adapted into several [[film]]s and [[play (theatre)|play]]s, all of which center around the dramatic ice-skating competition as the climax of the story, in keeping with the book.

See http://www.heardutchhere.net/HansBrinker2.html. In Dutch editions of the book, names and other elements were adapted to make the story more believable to Dutch children; hence, translator P.J. Andriessen renamed German-sounding \"Gretel\" to \"Griete\" in the first Dutch edition of 1867, and Margreet Bruijn changed the main characters' names to the authentically Dutch regional forms of \"Hannes\" and \"Geertje\" in her 1954 adaptation.

They have little chance of doing well on their handmade wooden skates, but the prospect of the race and the prize of the silver skates excites them and fires their dreams.\n\nHans' father, Raff Brinker, suffered [[head injury|head trauma]] when he fell from a [[Levee|dike]]. It left him chronically ill, with episodes of [[amnesia]] and occasional violent outbursts, so he is unable to work. Mrs.&nbsp;Brinker, Hans, and Gretel must all work to support the family and are looked down upon in the community because they are poor. By chance, Hans meets the famous surgeon Dr.&nbsp;Boekman and begs him to treat their father, but the doctor's fees are expensive and he has been very gruff following the death of his wife and disappearance of his son. Eventually, Dr.&nbsp;Boekman is persuaded to examine Mr.&nbsp;Brinker. He diagnoses pressure on the brain, which can be cured by a risky and expensive operation involving [[Trepanation|trephining]].\n\nHans earns money to buy Gretel a pair of steel skates for the race. Later, when he earns enough to buy himself a pair of skates, he instead offers the money to Doctor Boekman to pay for his father's operation. Touched by this gesture, Dr.&nbsp;Boekman provides the surgery for free, and Hans is able to buy good skates for himself to skate in the race. Hans sacrifices his opportunity to win the boys' race by dropping out of the race to help a friend win. Gretel wins the girls' race and the precious prize: the eponymous Silver Skates. \n\nMr.&nbsp;Brinker's operation is successful, and he is restored to health and memory. Dr.&nbsp;Boekman is also changed, losing his gruff demeanour when he is reunited with his lost son through the unexpected help of Mr.&nbsp;Brinker. The Brinkers' fortunes are changed further by the almost miraculous recovery of Mr.&nbsp;Brinker's savings, which had been thought lost or stolen ten years ago.\n\nThe Brinker parents live a long and happy life. Dr.&nbsp;Boekman helps Hans go to [[medical school]], and Hans becomes a successful doctor. Gretel also grows up to enjoy a happy adult life.\n\n==Film adaptations==\n''Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates'' has been adapted into several [[film]]s and [[play (theatre)|play]]s, all of which center around the dramatic ice-skating competition as the climax of the story, in keeping with the book.

Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], completely closed in the 1960s was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] \n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Bicester to Bletchley.\n\n===South West===\n\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n* Regular passenger services between Yeovil Junction and Yeovil Pen Mill were withdrawn in 1968 and a limited service reinstated in 2015 which has since slowly increased.\n\n===East Anglia/Lincolnshire===\n* {{rws|Needham Market}} closed in 1967 was reopened in 1971 and {{rws|Watlington}} closed in 1968 was reopened in 1975\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Since closure in 1964 Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* Stations at {{rws|Syston}}, {{rws|Sileby}} and {{rws|Barrow-upon-Soar}} between Leicester and Loughborough closed in 1968 reopened in 1994. \n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Oakham Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A shuttle service between Kettering and Corby was introduced in 1987, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009 with [[Corby railway station|Corby]] served by direct trains to London and a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n* {{rws|Matlock Bath}} was closed in 1967 and reopened in 1972, {{rws|Narborough}} was closed in 1968 but reopened two years later, {{rws|Peartree}} was closed in 1968 and reopened 1976, {{rws|Willington}} was closed in 1968 and reopened in 1994 and {{rws|Wigston Glen Parva}} was closed in 1968 and replaced with a new station {{rws|South Wigston}} in 1986 on an adjacent site.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}.

Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North East===\n* On the lines from Leeds/Bradford to Skipton the following stations closed in 1965 have been reopened (or replacement stations on adjacent sites)- {{rws|Apperley Bridge}}, {{rws|Frizinghall}}, {{rws|Saltaire}}, {{rws|Steeton and Silsden}} and {{rws|Cononley}}\n* The line from Wakefield Kirkgate to Pontefract Monkhill closed in 1967 was reopened in 1992 with {{rws|Pontefract Tanshelf}} and two new stations.\n* {{rws|Swinton (South Yorkshire)}}, {{rws|Fitzwilliam}} and {{rws|Adwick}} were originally closed in 1967 but new stations were opened on adjacent sites.\n* Passenger service from Bradford to Huddersfield withdrawn in 1970 was reinstated in 2000 with reopening of {{rws|Brighouse}} station. In 2017 trains also served {{rws|Low Moor}} which was originally closed in 1965.\n* Other stations reopened are {{rws|Dronfield}} (closed 1967 reopened 1981), {{rws|Slaithwaite}} (closed 1968 reopened 1982) and {{rws|Sherburn-in-Elmet}} (closed 1965 reopened 1984).\n\n===North West===\n* The Merseyrail line from Liverpool Central to Hunts Cross was closed in 1972 and mainly reopened in 1978.\n* {{rws|Wetheral}} closed in 1967 was reopened in 1981.\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].

It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened.

Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], completely closed in the 1960s was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] \n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968.

A shuttle service between Kettering and Corby was introduced in 1987, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009 with [[Corby railway station|Corby]] served by direct trains to London and a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n* {{rws|Matlock Bath}} was closed in 1967 and reopened in 1972, {{rws|Narborough}} was closed in 1968 but reopened two years later, {{rws|Peartree}} was closed in 1968 and reopened 1976, {{rws|Willington}} was closed in 1968 and reopened in 1994 and {{rws|Wigston Glen Parva}} was closed in 1968 and replaced with a new station {{rws|South Wigston}} in 1986 on an adjacent site.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}.
