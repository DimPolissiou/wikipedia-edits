It has also been argued that Vofionus corresponds to [[Janus]], because an entry in [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] (204, edition of Lindsay) indicates there was a Roman triad of Jupiter, Mars, and Janus, each having ''quirinus'' as a title; C.

From 1923 to 1993 it was part of the [[Diocese of Copenhagen]]. In 1980 a bishop was appointed for Greenland on behalf of the Bishop of Copenhagen.

It is a soft, malleable, and [[ductility|ductile]] metal with very high [[thermal conductivity|thermal]] and [[electrical conductivity]]. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a [[Copper (color)|pinkish-orange color]]. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a [[building material#Metal|building material]], and as a constituent of various metal [[alloy]]s, such as [[sterling silver]] used in [[jewelry]], [[cupronickel]] used to make marine hardware and [[coins]], and [[constantan]] used in [[strain gauge]]s and [[thermocouples]] for temperature measurement.\n\nCopper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form ([[native metal]]s). This led to very early human use in several regions, from c. 8000 BC. Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to be [[Smelting|smelted]] from sulfide ores, c. 5000 BC, the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal, [[tin]], to create [[bronze]], c. 3500 BC.<ref name=\"EncBrit\">{{cite book |editor1-last=McHenry |editor1-first=Charles |title=The New Encyclopedia Britannica |date=1992 |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc. |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-85229-553-3 |page=612 |volume=3 |edition=15}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[ancient Rome|Roman era]], copper was principally mined on [[Cyprus]], the origin of the name of the metal, from ''aes \u0441yprium'' (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to ''\u0441uprum'' (Latin), whence ''coper'' ([[Old English]]) and ''copper'', first used around 1530.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/copper|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|title=Copper|date=2018|accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nCommonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as [[azurite]], [[malachite]], and [[turquoise]], and have been used widely and historically as pigments.\n\nCopper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green [[verdigris]] (or [[patina]]). Copper is sometimes used in [[decorative art]], both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as [[bacteriostatic agent]]s, [[fungicide]]s, and wood preservatives.\n\nCopper is essential to all living organisms as a trace [[dietary mineral]] because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex [[cytochrome c oxidase]].

It is a soft, malleable, and [[ductility|ductile]] metal with very high [[thermal conductivity|thermal]] and [[electrical conductivity]]. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a [[Copper (color)|pinkish-orange color]]. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a [[building material#Metal|building material]], and as a constituent of various metal [[alloy]]s, such as [[sterling silver]] used in [[jewelry]], [[cupronickel]] used to make marine hardware and [[coins]], and [[constantan]] used in [[strain gauge]]s and [[thermocouples]] for temperature measurement.\n\nCopper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form ([[native metal]]s). This led to very early human use in several regions, from c. 8000 BC. Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to be [[Smelting|smelted]] from sulfide ores, c. 5000 BC, the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal, [[tin]], to create [[bronze]], c. 3500 BC.<ref name=\"EncBrit\">{{cite book |editor1-last=McHenry |editor1-first=Charles |title=The New Encyclopedia Britannica |date=1992 |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc. |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-85229-553-3 |page=612 |volume=3 |edition=15}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[ancient Rome|Roman era]], copper was principally mined on [[Cyprus]], the origin of the name of the metal, from ''aes \u0441yprium'' (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to ''\u0441uprum'' (Latin), whence ''coper'' ([[Old English]]) and ''copper'', first used around 1530.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/copper|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|title=Copper|date=2018|accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nCommonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as [[azurite]], [[malachite]], and [[turquoise]], and have been used widely and historically as pigments.\n\nCopper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green [[verdigris]] (or [[patina]]). Copper is sometimes used in [[decorative art]], both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as [[bacteriostatic agent]]s, [[fungicide]]s, and wood preservatives.\n\nCopper is essential to all living organisms as a trace [[dietary mineral]] because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex [[cytochrome c oxidase]]. In [[molluscs]] and [[crustacea]]ns, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment [[hemocyanin]], replaced by the iron-complexed [[hemoglobin]] in fish and other [[vertebrate]]s.

Conversely, [[Wilson's disease]] causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues.\n\nSevere deficiency can be found by testing for low plasma or serum copper levels, low ceruloplasmin, and low red blood cell superoxide dismutase levels; these are not sensitive to marginal copper status. The \"cytochrome c oxidase activity of leucocytes and platelets\" has been stated as another factor in deficiency, but the results have not been confirmed by replication.<ref name=Bonhametal2002>{{cite journal|last=Bonham |first= Maxine |last2= O'Connor |first2= Jacqueline M. |last3= Hannigan |first3= Bernadette M. |last4= Strain |first4= J.J.|date=2002|title=The immune system as a physiological indicator of marginal copper status? |journal=British Journal of Nutrition|doi=10.1079/BJN2002558|pmid=12010579|volume=87|issue=5|pages=393\u2013403|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Toxicity===\n{{Main|Copper toxicity}}\n\nGram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans, possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of [[reactive oxygen species]] that damage [[DNA]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Yunbo|last2=Trush|first2=Michael|last3=Yager|first3=James|title=DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species originating from a copper-dependent oxidation of the 2-hydroxy catechol of estradiol|journal=Carcinogenesis|date=1994|volume=15|issue=7|pages=1421\u20131427|doi=10.1093/carcin/15.7.1421|pmid=8033320}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Starkebaum|last2=John|first2=M.
