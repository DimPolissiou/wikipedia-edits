It is situated southeast of the capital city of [[Sarajevo]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 22,282 inhabitants, while the town of Pale has a population of 13,883 inhabitants.\n\nThe famous [[Jahorina ski resort]] is located some {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from the municipality.\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nPale always represented an important junction between east and west that is the [[Sarajevo]] Valley and the [[Drina]] River basin. There are preserved ruins of roads and building from the Roman times in the nearby villages of Miosici and Ilijak. From early on this area served as a place of trade. In the late 14th and early 15th century the area surrounding Pale belonged to the Feudal [[House of Pavlovi\u0107]]. There were several fortified settlements: Pavlovac on the River Pra\u010da, Gradina in the Upper Pale and Hodidjed above the junction of the Miljacka rivers. The Hodidjed settlement served as an administrative center for the surrounding area.\n\nThe feudal house of Pavlovi\u0107 belonged to the upper crust of the Bosnian aristocracy, their holdings extended from [[Vrhbosna]] (today's [[Sarajevo]]) on the West to Dobruna on the east. Pavle Radenovi\u0107, the founder of the Pavlovi\u0107 line, aside from his ancestral holdings around Pale also owned the mines in Olovo, the city of Trebinje, and parts of Konavle and [[Cavtat]]. The area under his control enjoyed prosperous trade between the locals and the Merchants from [[Dubrovnik]]. The main trading center was the town of Praca, part of the Pale Municipality today. After the death of Pavle in 1415 during a duel, his younger son Radoslav Pavlovi\u0107 (1420\u20131421) would take over from his father.\n\nAfter the death of the Bosnian [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|King Tvrtko I]] in 1391 the Bosnian feudals houses struggled to gain the throne. The sons of Pavle, under the threat from other Bosnian aristocrats, asked for the help of their allies the [[Ottomans]]. The Ottomans pursued a strategy of divide and conquer that eventually resulted in complete conquest.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pale.rs.ba/pale/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D59%26Itemid%3D69 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923170721/http://www.pale.rs.ba/pale/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=69 |archivedate=September 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nAfter the [[Fall of Bosnia to the Ottomans|fall of Bosnia]] the feudal holdings of the House of Pavlovi\u0107 were divided into 11 districts, and renamed the entire area the \"Pavli [[Vilayet]]. The first Ottoman census in the year 1468\u201369 the town of Pale is recorded under the name of \"Bogazi Yumry\" as the seat of one of the 11 districts. The district of \"Bogazi Yumry\" contained six villages of which two were located on the plane of Pale.\n\nDue to the harsh conditions in which the local Christian population found itself, there is very little data about the urban development during the Ottoman rule of this area in the Middle Ages. The area continued to be commercially viable and valuable to the new rulers. The town of Praca continued to grow and expand until the great fire and outbreak of Black Death in the 18th century. The name \"Pavli Vilayet\" continued to be used for this area until the beginning of the 19th century and the town eventually came to be known as Pale. One of the earliest recordings of this new name is a map from 1877, where the town itself as well as the entire region are labelled as \"Pale\".\n\nDuring the 19th century the Ottoman Empire found itself under the two politically and socially completely different power struggles. The early decades of the 19th century were marked with a series of national and ethnic freedom movements of the many subject people. The Ottoman aristocracy on the other hand was deeply conservative and was resisting any efforts towards reform and development of a centralized state. The aristocracy in Bosnia was among the most dissatisfied in the empire, jealously guarding its right against the powers.\n\nIn 1831, Captain [[Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107]], one of the wealthiest and most powerful members of the Bosnian aristocracy, came to lead the rebel aristocrats. After the conquest of Travnik, the seat of the Ottoman Viceroy, the Bosnian aristocracy demanded that the Sultan halt his reform efforts and keep the status quo in Bosnia. In addition they wanted the right to vote for and appoint the Viceroy from among their ranks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nCaptain Hussain did not wait for the Sultan to answer their demands and appointed himself the Vice Roy of Bosnia, alienating many of his supporters in the process. The Sultan played the different factions against each other and in 1832 sent an army against the rebels. One of the decisive battles against the rebels took place in the town of Pale itself. Captain Husein did not command sufficient numbers of troops and suffered a defeat. The decisive victory broke the back of the revolt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian rule===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:Narrow-Gauge-Railway Ostbahn Station-Pale.jpg|thumb|left|Railway station in Pale after opening in 1906]]\nWith the [[Berlin Congress]] Bosnia was [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|placed under the administration of Austria-Hungary]]. During this time significant investment and economic changes were made in Pale and the surrounding areas.\n\nThe new overlords were favoring the exploitation of the natural resources, primarily mineral and wood products.  The town of Pale at this point becomes an important logging and wood products center in the region. According to the 1895 census, Pale with the adjacent villages had 483 inhabitants. 440 inhabitants were engaged in agricultural and logging activities while 27 were engaged in clerical work. Industrial development spurs on supporting activities. New trade shops, hotels and other service activities are brought to the town.\n\nIn February 1907 Pale receives the first Elementary School. The school was administered by the school-church board of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in Pale. The school admitted students regardless of their faith. Along with Orthodox Christians, Catholic and Jewish students also attended the school. These were mostly the children of people who were involved in the town log mill.\n\nAccording to administrative records of the Austro-Hungarian administration, by 1879 in Pale there were already two modern log mills, and their products were transported to Sarajevo.  With the construction of the rail line connecting the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo with its eastern border town [[Vi\u0161egrad]] the town of Pale received its first railway station. The railway link enabled Pale to continue to grow and prosper with foreign investment making it possible to open several additional mills in the town. Construction of the [[East Bosnian railway|Bosnian Eastern Railway]] from [[Sarajevo]] to [[Uvac, Rudo|Uvac]] and [[Donje Vardi\u0161te|Vardi\u0161te]] started in 1903. It was completed in 1906, using the {{RailGauge|760mm|lk=on}} [[track gauge]]. With the cost of 75 million gold crowns, which approximately translates to 450 thousand gold crowns per kilometer, it was one of the most expensive railways in the world built by that time. The line was closed down in 1978, and dismantled afterwards.<ref name=\"VisegradTurizam NGR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.visegradturizam.com/english/narrow-gauge-railway-visegrad-vardiste|title=Narrow-gauge railway in Vi\u0161egrad|website=visegradturizam.com|publisher=Tourist organization of Vi\u0161egrad|access-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917020046/http://www.visegradturizam.com/english/narrow-gauge-railway-visegrad-vardiste|archivedate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nIn the early months of 1914 after the decisive Serbian victory at the [[Battle of Cer]] the allies requested from the Serbs and their Montenegrin allies to attack the Austro-Hungarians in Bosnia and tie up their forces there.\n\nIn October 1914 the Serbo-Montenegrin armies penetrated the areas surrounding Sarajevo and gained control of Mt. Romanija. During that operation, Montenegrin units entered Pale. Soon afterwards, the Montegrins had to withdraw. Along with them a large part of the local Serbian population.\n\nThose who were unable to flee were at the mercy of the Austrian Schutz corps, irregular Austrian police forces tasked with suppressing revolt within the empire. Pale was pillaged and burned down completely after the Austrian forces re-entered the town. 54 local residents were lynched in the town center.\n\nIn the town of [[Gora\u017ede]], a refugee column of villagers from nearby villages such as Praca, Vijara, Budj, Podgrab, Vrhpraca, Gorovici, Hotocine, Glasinac, Podromanija and Socica were intercepted by Austrian regular forces and the irregulars before they could cross the [[Drina]] river. 48 adult men were separated from the rest of the group and executed by pistol-shot, while the remaining refugees were forced into detention camps.\n\nConditions in these detention camps were especially harsh. Among the most infamous was the detention camp in [[Doboj]]. From December 1914 to July 1917 more than 45,000 people (mostly [[Serbs]]) were detained there. While the exact numbers of fatalities will probably never be known, more than 1000 fatalities were identified, 230 of which were from the Pale municipality.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Post WWI===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nWith the end of the war and the absorption of Bosnia into the newly created Kingdom of [[Yugoslavia]], the town of Pale once again struck out towards growth. The basis for economic recovery and development once again, as before, were based the on the natural resources of the region, in particular forestry.\n\nNewly developed transportation links with [[Sarajevo]] spurred growth. In 1928 the town itself became the center of the municipality. By 1939 there were more than 14 log mills in Pale which generated more than {{convert|90000|m3|0|abbr=out}} of wood products. Increased economic development spurred population growth. Between 1921 and 1931 the number of inhabitants increased from 2,382 to 11,103.\n\nIn the 1930 one could already find 30 to 40 large buildings. In 1935 a modern water supply system was put into use. The town flourished culturally as well. New and old schools were renovated and built. A community center, completed in 1928, dedicated to the victims of World War I featured gymnastic equipment and from time to time cultural and entertainment events were held there. Amateur theater and folk dance companies were active there as well.\n\nIn 1934 the Vihor Football Club was founded, and along with it a new soccer stadium was constructed. The cultural and sport society \"Soko\" was responsible for a large level of participation by Pale's inhabitants in their athletic programs. The members of this club would go on to successfully compete in [[Zagreb]], [[Ljubljana]] and [[Prague]]. In this period the town also received the first medical facility as well as a library.\n\nBy the 1940 Pale already have the looks of a small, but very well arranged city. A significant number of intellectuals as well as affluent and influential people from Sarajevo and other places in the country constructed summer homes in Pale.  All of this was interrupted with the German attack on Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the conquests of Zagreb and Belgrade the German forces turned their drive towards the center of the country. On 15 April, a German motorized division would occupy Sarajevo and capture the Yugoslav Supreme Military command in the town of Pale itself. By April 1941 a complete surrender was signed. The short April war brought on a full dismemberment of the country. The town of Pale was incorporated into the Nazi-affiliated [[Independent State of Croatia]].\n\nThe first of act of the newly installed puppet regime in the town of Pale was the demolition of the World War I Victim Memorial as well the demolition of the Eastern Orthodox Church. All Serb enterprises were nationalized and taken over by Nazi sympathizers. The former home to the cultural center was turned into the HQ of the local regiment of Ustashe, which would soon serve as prison and detention center. Mass deportations, executions of prominent Serbs were daily occurrences. During the summer of 1941 the first massacres occurred, the villages of Njemanici and Bjelogorica were completely destroyed and more than sixty people were murdered.\n\nFaced with this kind of mistreatment the local populace started an armed revolt. The initial skirmishes took place in the early morning hours of 1 August 1941. The occupation forces tried to brutally suppress this revolt and during the month of August more than 75 prominent town folk were arrested and deported to death camps.\n\nIn mid-November 1943 in a retaliatory expedition the Ustashe killed more than 100 inhabitants of the village of [[Rakovac (Pale)|Rakovac]]. After 45 men out of that village reported to the [[Usta\u0161e]] administration for the issuance of new identification documents they were all arrested and in pairs of two were chained to each other. They were transported and murdered. After they killed the men they went to Rakovac to kill the remaining women, children and the elderly. Once the surviving witnesses, Milan Star\u010devi\u0107, residing today in Pale, testified: ''\"After they say that a part of the village inhabitants was missing the Ustashe sent out search parties and came to the Alija Hill. There they were stopped by the Germans. The Germans did not allow them to go into the Santrac house where about 10 or so women and children had fled. There were even shots exchanged among the Ustashe and the Germans.\"''\n\nThe next day Milan Star\u010devi\u0107's brother went with German troops back to bury the victims of the Ustashe massacre. During World War II in the municipality of Pale more than 1200 civilians were murdered, while another 350 resistance fighters were killed in the fighting.\n\n===Pale after WWII===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nAfter World War II, the town and municipality of Pale, thanks to the tireless efforts of the local population, slowly recover and resume their economic development. In 1946 on the foundations of the old log mil a new one is constructed. This new mill would produce more than {{convert|25000|m3|0|abbr=out}} of wood products. The mill itself employed more than 170 in the mill and an addition 150 in the forest.\n\nIn 1952 a military maintenance facility in the suburb of Koran was constructed. The local economy received the first important building block for the metal industry. Between 1952 and 1960 and additional 300\u2013400 employees were hired in that facility.\n\nWith the development of the metal industry there are significant migration into the town, the suburb of Koran is built out with new building and apartment complexes constructed.\n\nIn 1968 the Military Maintenance complex in Koran enters is merged with the \"FAMOS\" corporation and is incorporated as \"FAMOS-Koran\". This merger brings further development and new work opportunities. Famos-Koran would go on to manufacture parts for heavy engines, transmissions and vehicles. Towards the end of the 1980s there were more than 2000 employees at Famos-Koran. In addition factories were add for the manufacture of engine turbos and manufacture of parts for the Mercedes Benz OM-360 engine that was built under licence.\n\n===War in Bosnia===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nDuring 1991 and 1992, as the tensions rose in the run up to the [[Bosnian War]], the Pale region became an administrative center of the nascent anti-Sarajevo and pro-Serb [[Republika Srpska]]. It would remain a center of activity for the Serb forces during their [[Siege of Sarajevo]] which led to the deaths of more than 10,000 people and the wounding of 56,000 (including 15,000 children). Several high ranking Serb commanders in control of forces from the region, including General [[Stanislav Gali\u0107]] were sentenced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for crimes against the people of Sarajevo where a campaign of unrelenting violence against the inhabitants was led.\n\nThe town became the nominal administrative headquarters of the Bosnian Serb government, while [[Banja Luka]] became the ''de facto'' capital. Pale remained an important cultural center with a collection of cultural and informational institutions such as a news agency (SRNA), a television station (Canal S) and newspapers (''Javnost'' and ''Ognji\u0161ta'') are based there.\n\n===Post Dayton===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nThe Bosnian War ended with the signing of the Dayton Peace accords on 14 December 1995. With the war at the end the town return to some sort of normalcy. As the [[Constitution of Republika Srpska]] sets out that [[Sarajevo]] is the capital of [[Republika Srpska]] which was recognized as an entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] by the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]]. The administrative capital has now transferred to [[Banja Luka]].\n\nIn 2013 the local authorities and residents welcomed convicted war criminal [[Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik]] after his release from jail. In 2006, he had been sentenced to 27 years in prison for crimes against humanity on non-Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war, some of which included persecution, extermination, murder and forced deportations. But his sentence was reduced and he was released early. The Municipal Board of the Serbian Democratic Party prepared the welcome which was attended by 3,000 Serbs.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/news/116577/war-criminal-krajisnik-welcomed-by-serbs-in-pale |title=War criminal Krajisnik welcomed by Serbs in Pale &#124; Balkans &#124; Worldbulletin News |publisher=Worldbulletin.net |date=2013-08-31 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Settlements==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Bjelogorci (Pale)|Bjelogorci]]\n* [[Blju\u0161tevac]]\n* [[Bogovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Brdari\u0107i]]\n* [[Brdo (Pale)|Brdo]]\n* [[Brezovice (Pale)|Brezovice]]\n* [[Brnjica (Pale)|Brnjica]]\n* [[Brojni\u0107i]]\n* [[Bu\u0111]]\n* [[\u010celjadini\u0107i]]\n* [[\u010cemernica (Pale)|\u010cemernica]]\n* [[\u0106emanovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Datelji]]\n* [[Donja Ljubogo\u0161ta]]\n* [[Donja Vin\u010da]]\n* [[Gluhovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gornja Ljubogo\u0161ta]]\n* [[Gornja Vin\u010da]]\n* [[Gornje Pale]]\n* [[Gornji Pribanj]]\n* [[Gorovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gradac (Pale)|Gradac]]\n* [[Gute (Pale)|Gute]]\n* [[Hoto\u010dina]]\n* [[Jahorina (Pale)|Jahorina]]\n* [[Jasik (Pale)|Jasik]]\n* [[Jelovci]]\n* [[Kadino Selo]]\n* [[Kamenica (Pale)|Kamenica]]\n* [[Kasidoli]]\n* [[Komrani]]\n* [[Kosmaj (Pale)|Kosmaj]]\n* [[Kostre\u0161a]]\n* [[Kra\u010dule]]\n* [[Luke (Pale)|Luke]]\n* [[Mio\u0161i\u0107i]]\n* [[Modrik]]\n* [[Mokro (Pale)|Mokro]]\n* [[Nehori\u0107i (Pale)|Nehori\u0107i]]\n* [[Pra\u010da (Pale-Pra\u010da)|Pra\u010da]]\n* [[Pavlovac (Pale)|Pavlovac]]\n* [[Petovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Podgrab]]\n* [[Podloznik]]\n* [[Podmedenik]]\n* [[Podvitez]]\n* [[Ponor (Pale)|Ponor]]\n* [[Pra\u010da (Pale-Pra\u010da)|Pra\u010da]]\n* [[Prutine]]\n* [[Pustopolje]]\n* [[Radonji\u0107i (Pale)|Radonji\u0107i]]\n* [[Rakite]]\n* [[Rakovac (Pale)|Rakovac]]\n* [[Renovica]]\n* [[Rogou\u0161i\u0107i]]\n* [[Rosulje (Pale)|Rosulje]]\n* [[Saice]]\n* [[Sinjevo]]\n* [[Sjetlina]]\n* [[Srednje (Pale)|Srednje]]\n* [[Stajna]]\n* [[Stambol\u010di\u0107]]\n* [[Strane (Pale)|Strane]]\n* [[Sumbulovac]]\n* [[\u0160ainovi\u0107i]]\n* [[\u0160ip (Pale)|\u0160ip]]\n* [[Turkovi\u0107i (Pale)|Turkovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Ude\u017e]]\n* [[Vinograd]]\n* [[Vlahovi\u0107i (Pale)|Vlahovi\u0107i]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Dating of the remnants places them in the late Bronze Age, but remnants dating back to neolite and mezolite age are also expected to be found.\n\nBecause of its scientific and aesthetic characteristics the cave is destined to become the focus of the research and educational projects of the Faculty of Philosophy in Pale.

It is situated southeast of the capital city of [[Sarajevo]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 22,282 inhabitants.\n\nThe famous [[Jahorina ski resort]] is located some {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from the municipality.\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nPale always represented an important junction between east and west that is the [[Sarajevo]] Valley and the [[Drina]] River basin. There are preserved ruins of roads and building from the Roman times in the nearby villages of Miosici and Ilijak. From early on this area served as a place of trade. In the late 14th and early 15th century the area surrounding Pale belonged to the Feudal [[House of Pavlovi\u0107]]. There were several fortified settlements: Pavlovac on the River Pra\u010da, Gradina in the Upper Pale and Hodidjed above the junction of the Miljacka rivers. The Hodidjed settlement served as an administrative center for the surrounding area.\n\nThe feudal house of Pavlovi\u0107 belonged to the upper crust of the Bosnian aristocracy, their holdings extended from [[Vrhbosna]] (today's [[Sarajevo]]) on the West to Dobruna on the east. Pavle Radenovi\u0107, the founder of the Pavlovi\u0107 line, aside from his ancestral holdings around Pale also owned the mines in Olovo, the city of Trebinje, and parts of Konavle and [[Cavtat]]. The area under his control enjoyed prosperous trade between the locals and the Merchants from [[Dubrovnik]]. The main trading center was the town of Praca, part of the Pale Municipality today. After the death of Pavle in 1415 during a duel, his younger son Radoslav Pavlovi\u0107 (1420\u20131421) would take over from his father.\n\nAfter the death of the Bosnian [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|King Tvrtko I]] in 1391 the Bosnian feudals houses struggled to gain the throne. The sons of Pavle, under the threat from other Bosnian aristocrats, asked for the help of their allies the [[Ottomans]]. The Ottomans pursued a strategy of divide and conquer that eventually resulted in complete conquest.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pale.rs.ba/pale/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D59%26Itemid%3D69 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923170721/http://www.pale.rs.ba/pale/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=69 |archivedate=September 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nAfter the [[Fall of Bosnia to the Ottomans|fall of Bosnia]] the feudal holdings of the House of Pavlovi\u0107 were divided into 11 districts, and renamed the entire area the \"Pavli [[Vilayet]]. The first Ottoman census in the year 1468\u201369 the town of Pale is recorded under the name of \"Bogazi Yumry\" as the seat of one of the 11 districts. The district of \"Bogazi Yumry\" contained six villages of which two were located on the plane of Pale.\n\nDue to the harsh conditions in which the local Christian population found itself, there is very little data about the urban development during the Ottoman rule of this area in the Middle Ages. The area continued to be commercially viable and valuable to the new rulers. The town of Praca continued to grow and expand until the great fire and outbreak of Black Death in the 18th century. The name \"Pavli Vilayet\" continued to be used for this area until the beginning of the 19th century and the town eventually came to be known as Pale. One of the earliest recordings of this new name is a map from 1877, where the town itself as well as the entire region are labelled as \"Pale\".\n\nDuring the 19th century the Ottoman Empire found itself under the two politically and socially completely different power struggles. The early decades of the 19th century were marked with a series of national and ethnic freedom movements of the many subject people. The Ottoman aristocracy on the other hand was deeply conservative and was resisting any efforts towards reform and development of a centralized state. The aristocracy in Bosnia was among the most dissatisfied in the empire, jealously guarding its right against the powers.\n\nIn 1831, Captain [[Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107]], one of the wealthiest and most powerful members of the Bosnian aristocracy, came to lead the rebel aristocrats. After the conquest of Travnik, the seat of the Ottoman Viceroy, the Bosnian aristocracy demanded that the Sultan halt his reform efforts and keep the status quo in Bosnia. In addition they wanted the right to vote for and appoint the Viceroy from among their ranks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nCaptain Hussain did not wait for the Sultan to answer their demands and appointed himself the Vice Roy of Bosnia, alienating many of his supporters in the process. The Sultan played the different factions against each other and in 1832 sent an army against the rebels. One of the decisive battles against the rebels took place in the town of Pale itself. Captain Husein did not command sufficient numbers of troops and suffered a defeat. The decisive victory broke the back of the revolt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian rule===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:Narrow-Gauge-Railway Ostbahn Station-Pale.jpg|thumb|left|Railway station in Pale after opening in 1906]]\nWith the [[Berlin Congress]] Bosnia was [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|placed under the administration of Austria-Hungary]]. During this time significant investment and economic changes were made in Pale and the surrounding areas.\n\nThe new overlords were favoring the exploitation of the natural resources, primarily mineral and wood products.  The town of Pale at this point becomes an important logging and wood products center in the region. According to the 1895 census, Pale with the adjacent villages had 483 inhabitants. 440 inhabitants were engaged in agricultural and logging activities while 27 were engaged in clerical work. Industrial development spurs on supporting activities. New trade shops, hotels and other service activities are brought to the town.\n\nIn February 1907 Pale receives the first Elementary School. The school was administered by the school-church board of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in Pale. The school admitted students regardless of their faith. Along with Orthodox Christians, Catholic and Jewish students also attended the school. These were mostly the children of people who were involved in the town log mill.\n\nAccording to administrative records of the Austro-Hungarian administration, by 1879 in Pale there were already two modern log mills, and their products were transported to Sarajevo.  With the construction of the rail line connecting the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo with its eastern border town [[Vi\u0161egrad]] the town of Pale received its first railway station. The railway link enabled Pale to continue to grow and prosper with foreign investment making it possible to open several additional mills in the town. Construction of the [[East Bosnian railway|Bosnian Eastern Railway]] from [[Sarajevo]] to [[Uvac, Rudo|Uvac]] and [[Donje Vardi\u0161te|Vardi\u0161te]] started in 1903. It was completed in 1906, using the {{RailGauge|760mm|lk=on}} [[track gauge]]. With the cost of 75 million gold crowns, which approximately translates to 450 thousand gold crowns per kilometer, it was one of the most expensive railways in the world built by that time. The line was closed down in 1978, and dismantled afterwards.<ref name=\"VisegradTurizam NGR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.visegradturizam.com/english/narrow-gauge-railway-visegrad-vardiste|title=Narrow-gauge railway in Vi\u0161egrad|website=visegradturizam.com|publisher=Tourist organization of Vi\u0161egrad|access-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917020046/http://www.visegradturizam.com/english/narrow-gauge-railway-visegrad-vardiste|archivedate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nIn the early months of 1914 after the decisive Serbian victory at the [[Battle of Cer]] the allies requested from the Serbs and their Montenegrin allies to attack the Austro-Hungarians in Bosnia and tie up their forces there.\n\nIn October 1914 the Serbo-Montenegrin armies penetrated the areas surrounding Sarajevo and gained control of Mt. Romanija. During that operation, Montenegrin units entered Pale. Soon afterwards, the Montegrins had to withdraw. Along with them a large part of the local Serbian population.\n\nThose who were unable to flee were at the mercy of the Austrian Schutz corps, irregular Austrian police forces tasked with suppressing revolt within the empire. Pale was pillaged and burned down completely after the Austrian forces re-entered the town. 54 local residents were lynched in the town center.\n\nIn the town of [[Gora\u017ede]], a refugee column of villagers from nearby villages such as Praca, Vijara, Budj, Podgrab, Vrhpraca, Gorovici, Hotocine, Glasinac, Podromanija and Socica were intercepted by Austrian regular forces and the irregulars before they could cross the [[Drina]] river. 48 adult men were separated from the rest of the group and executed by pistol-shot, while the remaining refugees were forced into detention camps.\n\nConditions in these detention camps were especially harsh. Among the most infamous was the detention camp in [[Doboj]]. From December 1914 to July 1917 more than 45,000 people (mostly [[Serbs]]) were detained there. While the exact numbers of fatalities will probably never be known, more than 1000 fatalities were identified, 230 of which were from the Pale municipality.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Post WWI===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nWith the end of the war and the absorption of Bosnia into the newly created Kingdom of [[Yugoslavia]], the town of Pale once again struck out towards growth. The basis for economic recovery and development once again, as before, were based the on the natural resources of the region, in particular forestry.\n\nNewly developed transportation links with [[Sarajevo]] spurred growth. In 1928 the town itself became the center of the municipality. By 1939 there were more than 14 log mills in Pale which generated more than {{convert|90000|m3|0|abbr=out}} of wood products. Increased economic development spurred population growth. Between 1921 and 1931 the number of inhabitants increased from 2,382 to 11,103.\n\nIn the 1930 one could already find 30 to 40 large buildings. In 1935 a modern water supply system was put into use. The town flourished culturally as well. New and old schools were renovated and built. A community center, completed in 1928, dedicated to the victims of World War I featured gymnastic equipment and from time to time cultural and entertainment events were held there. Amateur theater and folk dance companies were active there as well.\n\nIn 1934 the Vihor Football Club was founded, and along with it a new soccer stadium was constructed. The cultural and sport society \"Soko\" was responsible for a large level of participation by Pale's inhabitants in their athletic programs. The members of this club would go on to successfully compete in [[Zagreb]], [[Ljubljana]] and [[Prague]]. In this period the town also received the first medical facility as well as a library.\n\nBy the 1940 Pale already have the looks of a small, but very well arranged city. A significant number of intellectuals as well as affluent and influential people from Sarajevo and other places in the country constructed summer homes in Pale.  All of this was interrupted with the German attack on Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the conquests of Zagreb and Belgrade the German forces turned their drive towards the center of the country. On 15 April, a German motorized division would occupy Sarajevo and capture the Yugoslav Supreme Military command in the town of Pale itself. By April 1941 a complete surrender was signed. The short April war brought on a full dismemberment of the country. The town of Pale was incorporated into the Nazi-affiliated [[Independent State of Croatia]].\n\nThe first of act of the newly installed puppet regime in the town of Pale was the demolition of the World War I Victim Memorial as well the demolition of the Eastern Orthodox Church. All Serb enterprises were nationalized and taken over by Nazi sympathizers. The former home to the cultural center was turned into the HQ of the local regiment of Ustashe, which would soon serve as prison and detention center. Mass deportations, executions of prominent Serbs were daily occurrences. During the summer of 1941 the first massacres occurred, the villages of Njemanici and Bjelogorica were completely destroyed and more than sixty people were murdered.\n\nFaced with this kind of mistreatment the local populace started an armed revolt. The initial skirmishes took place in the early morning hours of 1 August 1941. The occupation forces tried to brutally suppress this revolt and during the month of August more than 75 prominent town folk were arrested and deported to death camps.\n\nIn mid-November 1943 in a retaliatory expedition the Ustashe killed more than 100 inhabitants of the village of [[Rakovac (Pale)|Rakovac]]. After 45 men out of that village reported to the [[Usta\u0161e]] administration for the issuance of new identification documents they were all arrested and in pairs of two were chained to each other. They were transported and murdered. After they killed the men they went to Rakovac to kill the remaining women, children and the elderly. Once the surviving witnesses, Milan Star\u010devi\u0107, residing today in Pale, testified: ''\"After they say that a part of the village inhabitants was missing the Ustashe sent out search parties and came to the Alija Hill. There they were stopped by the Germans. The Germans did not allow them to go into the Santrac house where about 10 or so women and children had fled. There were even shots exchanged among the Ustashe and the Germans.\"''\n\nThe next day Milan Star\u010devi\u0107's brother went with German troops back to bury the victims of the Ustashe massacre. During World War II in the municipality of Pale more than 1200 civilians were murdered, while another 350 resistance fighters were killed in the fighting.\n\n===Pale after WWII===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nAfter World War II, the town and municipality of Pale, thanks to the tireless efforts of the local population, slowly recover and resume their economic development. In 1946 on the foundations of the old log mil a new one is constructed. This new mill would produce more than {{convert|25000|m3|0|abbr=out}} of wood products. The mill itself employed more than 170 in the mill and an addition 150 in the forest.\n\nIn 1952 a military maintenance facility in the suburb of Koran was constructed. The local economy received the first important building block for the metal industry. Between 1952 and 1960 and additional 300\u2013400 employees were hired in that facility.\n\nWith the development of the metal industry there are significant migration into the town, the suburb of Koran is built out with new building and apartment complexes constructed.\n\nIn 1968 the Military Maintenance complex in Koran enters is merged with the \"FAMOS\" corporation and is incorporated as \"FAMOS-Koran\". This merger brings further development and new work opportunities. Famos-Koran would go on to manufacture parts for heavy engines, transmissions and vehicles. Towards the end of the 1980s there were more than 2000 employees at Famos-Koran. In addition factories were add for the manufacture of engine turbos and manufacture of parts for the Mercedes Benz OM-360 engine that was built under licence.\n\n===War in Bosnia===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nDuring 1991 and 1992, as the tensions rose in the run up to the [[Bosnian War]], the Pale region became an administrative center of the nascent anti-Sarajevo and pro-Serb [[Republika Srpska]]. It would remain a center of activity for the Serb forces during their [[Siege of Sarajevo]] which led to the deaths of more than 10,000 people and the wounding of 56,000 (including 15,000 children). Several high ranking Serb commanders in control of forces from the region, including General [[Stanislav Gali\u0107]] were sentenced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for crimes against the people of Sarajevo where a campaign of unrelenting violence against the inhabitants was led.\n\nThe town became the nominal administrative headquarters of the Bosnian Serb government, while [[Banja Luka]] became the ''de facto'' capital. Pale remained an important cultural center with a collection of cultural and informational institutions such as a news agency (SRNA), a television station (Canal S) and newspapers (''Javnost'' and ''Ognji\u0161ta'') are based there.\n\n===Post Dayton===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2016}}\nThe Bosnian War ended with the signing of the Dayton Peace accords on 14 December 1995. With the war at the end the town return to some sort of normalcy. As the [[Constitution of Republika Srpska]] sets out that [[Sarajevo]] is the capital of [[Republika Srpska]] which was recognized as an entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] by the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]]. The administrative capital has now transferred to [[Banja Luka]].\n\nIn 2013 the local authorities and residents welcomed convicted war criminal [[Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik]] after his release from jail. In 2006, he had been sentenced to 27 years in prison for crimes against humanity on non-Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war, some of which included persecution, extermination, murder and forced deportations. But his sentence was reduced and he was released early. The Municipal Board of the Serbian Democratic Party prepared the welcome which was attended by 3,000 Serbs.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/news/116577/war-criminal-krajisnik-welcomed-by-serbs-in-pale |title=War criminal Krajisnik welcomed by Serbs in Pale &#124; Balkans &#124; Worldbulletin News |publisher=Worldbulletin.net |date=2013-08-31 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Settlements==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Bjelogorci (Pale)|Bjelogorci]]\n* [[Blju\u0161tevac]]\n* [[Bogovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Brdari\u0107i]]\n* [[Brdo (Pale)|Brdo]]\n* [[Brezovice (Pale)|Brezovice]]\n* [[Brnjica (Pale)|Brnjica]]\n* [[Brojni\u0107i]]\n* [[Bu\u0111]]\n* [[\u010celjadini\u0107i]]\n* [[\u010cemernica (Pale)|\u010cemernica]]\n* [[\u0106emanovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Datelji]]\n* [[Donja Ljubogo\u0161ta]]\n* [[Donja Vin\u010da]]\n* [[Gluhovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gornja Ljubogo\u0161ta]]\n* [[Gornja Vin\u010da]]\n* [[Gornje Pale]]\n* [[Gornji Pribanj]]\n* [[Gorovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gradac (Pale)|Gradac]]\n* [[Gute (Pale)|Gute]]\n* [[Hoto\u010dina]]\n* [[Jahorina (Pale)|Jahorina]]\n* [[Jasik (Pale)|Jasik]]\n* [[Jelovci]]\n* [[Kadino Selo]]\n* [[Kamenica (Pale)|Kamenica]]\n* [[Kasidoli]]\n* [[Komrani]]\n* [[Kosmaj (Pale)|Kosmaj]]\n* [[Kostre\u0161a]]\n* [[Kra\u010dule]]\n* [[Luke (Pale)|Luke]]\n* [[Mio\u0161i\u0107i]]\n* [[Modrik]]\n* [[Mokro (Pale)|Mokro]]\n* [[Nehori\u0107i (Pale)|Nehori\u0107i]]\n* [[Pra\u010da (Pale-Pra\u010da)|Pra\u010da]]\n* [[Pavlovac (Pale)|Pavlovac]]\n* [[Petovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Podgrab]]\n* [[Podloznik]]\n* [[Podmedenik]]\n* [[Podvitez]]\n* [[Ponor (Pale)|Ponor]]\n* [[Pra\u010da (Pale-Pra\u010da)|Pra\u010da]]\n* [[Prutine]]\n* [[Pustopolje]]\n* [[Radonji\u0107i (Pale)|Radonji\u0107i]]\n* [[Rakite]]\n* [[Rakovac (Pale)|Rakovac]]\n* [[Renovica]]\n* [[Rogou\u0161i\u0107i]]\n* [[Rosulje (Pale)|Rosulje]]\n* [[Saice]]\n* [[Sinjevo]]\n* [[Sjetlina]]\n* [[Srednje (Pale)|Srednje]]\n* [[Stajna]]\n* [[Stambol\u010di\u0107]]\n* [[Strane (Pale)|Strane]]\n* [[Sumbulovac]]\n* [[\u0160ainovi\u0107i]]\n* [[\u0160ip (Pale)|\u0160ip]]\n* [[Turkovi\u0107i (Pale)|Turkovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Ude\u017e]]\n* [[Vinograd]]\n* [[Vlahovi\u0107i (Pale)|Vlahovi\u0107i]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| type = \n| percentages = pagr\n|1971|16119 |1991|14480 |2013|20909\n}}\nAccording to the 2013 census results, the municipality has 20,909 inhabitants.

The serial starts with parallel scenes of the lead characters; Baalaaj (Zain Baig) and Hooriya (Azekah Daniel). Hooriya is a headstrong young girl living in the metropolitan city of Karachi and pursuing quality education. She likes wearing western clothes and rides a bike and is always ready to do any sorts of social work. Baalaaj on the other hand is a feudal boy living in a nearby village, where his uncle Malik Shahbaz is the head of the district. Baalaaj's parents died when he was an infant and was therefore, raised up by his aunt Surraya (Malik Shahbaz's wife). Being under his uncle Malik Shahbaz's supervision, Baalaaj has apparently turned out to be ill-mannered, cruel, with a feudal mindset just like him. He even gave up his studies as education was not valuable for him being the future head of his tribe. Not known to both Baalaaj and Hooriya is that they are engaged since childhood, as Hooriya is the daughter of Malik Shahbaz's younger step-brother Malik Wajahat. \n\nWajahat (Sohail Sameer) fell in love with his college-mate Samreen (Humera Bano) and married her against the wishes of his family. His brother Malik Shahbaz (Jahanzeb Gorchani) has ever since blamed him for this act and does not give him the due recognition and respect which Wajahat deserves being part of the Malik family. In all matters of decision-making, Baalaaj is above Wajahat. Succumbing to his family's pressure, Wajahat had got married for the second time to Saeeda (Natasha Ali), a girl chosen by his brothers, even when he was a father of two daughters with Samreen. It is told that Samreen had left the haveli of her in-laws when Malik Shahbaz got engaged her eldest daughter Hooriya to his nephew Baalaaj when they were just five-year old kids. Not agreeing to this old tradition of early engagements and fearing that Baalaaj will be as orthodox as his uncle and her daughter will be just like other women of this family having no say and respect in their lives, Samreen left her husband with her daughters to live a life of seclusion, where she can give them a better future. Wajahat didn't bring her back for their own betterment but also was not strong enough to go against his brother's decisions. Unknown to his family, Wajahat secretly keeps vigilance of his wife and daughters and sends them financial assistance through his trusted slave Ghulam Din. Samreen has never told her daughters about Hooriya's engagement or about the whereabouts of their paternal family.\n\nHooriya is in love with her childhood friend Danish (Hamza Firdous) who runs a mobile shop. But Danish's mother does not like Hooriya's boldness and extrovertness. Hooriya's mother is also not in favor of Danish as she believes that if his mother does not approve of Hooriya then their marriage will not be successful. \n\nOne day, after Hooriya gives meal to an old street-seller, he is wounded by Baalaaj's speeding vehicle, engaging  him and Hooriya in a verbal brawl. Hooriya makes the wounded man to be put in Baalaaj's car and taken to hospital. In hospital she makes Baalaaj pay all expenses. Baalaaj does this unwillingly and both him and Hooriya curse each other. Hence, from their very first meeting, Baalaaj and Hooriya are not on good terms.\n\nSurraya, called Bi jan (Seemi Pasha) wants her daughter Amber (Maryam Noor) to be married to Baalaaj. Bi jan loves Baalaaj as her own son and considers him as the best match for her daughter. Amber, unlike Baalaaj is continuing her studies and is in love with her class-fellow Faiq (Faraz Farouqi). But she is hesitant to tell about him to his family as Faiq is from middle-class and she knows that her father will never approve his proposal. Malik Shahbaz crowns Baalaaj as the head of the panchayat (ignoring Wajahat) and also commits him to his daughter, thinking that Samreen and her daughters will never come back in their lives, so Baalaaj and Hooriya's engagement is null and void. Baalaaj obediently agrees to this betrothment as his uncle's decision is the final order for him. Amber though very close to Baalaaj as a cousin, is not happy about this engagement. She tells about Faiq to Bi jan, but as expected she rejects it knowing that Malik Shahbaz will never accept a son-in-law from a lesser background. \n\nSeeing her husband's longing for his first wife and daughters, Saeeda one day visits Samreen. She asks her to return, to which Samreen refuses and asks her not to come back again. While leaving Saeeda meets Hooriya and her sister Minhal (Zainab Shabbir). She and Samreen lie to them that Saeeda is an old friend. Saeeda takes their picture for showing it to Wajahat and leaves. When she tells this to Wajahat, his reaction is not what Saeeda expected. He scolds her for interfering in his personal life and warns her not to go near his wife and daughters again. Saeeda once again realizes that only Samreen is Wajahat's love and she can never gain his trust. \n\nOne day Baalaaj and Amber are going home when due to his rash driving Baalaaj splashes water on the nearby walking Hooriya and Minhal. Hooriya as usual looses her temper and shouts at Baalaaj. Baalaaj also in a rage stops the car and gets out. Both recognize each other and start cursing once again. Amber and Minhal stop them from manhandling and they leave. Hence, the successive encounter of Baalaaj and Hooriya's is unfavorable too. \n\nDanish convinces his mother to ask Hooriya's hand in marriage and she does that reluctantly and they get engaged. Amber tells Faiq about her engagement and distances herself from him. Faiq is heart-broken to know that though he loves Amber but cannot get her due to their status difference. Faiq's mother is angry to know that Amber betrayed her son's loyalty by choosing her rich cousin over him. Danish and Faiq's mothers are relatives. They visit Samreen's place and on seeing Minhal, Faiq's mother immediately likes her. They make Faiq and Minhal meet, and Faiq for overcoming Amber's loss, develops interest in Minhal. Amber on the other hand is still in two minds in marrying Baalaaj. She asks Baalaaj to convince her father for delaying their marriage for few months to which he agrees. Amber again approaches Faiq. They both decide to run away. But on the night when Amber is leaving haveli, she is caught by Bi jan. After her mother makes her understand the importance of her background and Baalaaj as her life partner, Amber decides to stay and accepts Baalaaj as her first and last man. Faiq is waiting for her in his car but when she doesn't turn up, he is once again broken on her betrayal. \n\nPreparations start for Baalaaj and Amber's wedding. In city as well, there is a wedding which Hooriya's family is attending. During celebrations there is shooting in air and Samreen gets shot accidentally. Her condition is critical and the sisters don't have enough money for her surgery. Unwillingly, Hooriya calls Ghulam Din for help. On knowing about the accident, Wajahat arrives at the hospital and meets his daughters for the first time in years. Samreen is saved but she goes into comma. Wajahat decides to take his daughters to his haveli as he cannot leave them alone in the city. Hooriya and Minhal arrive at their paternal house on the eve of Baalaaj and Amber's mayun ceremony. Except for Saeeda no one is happy to see them there. On seeing Saeeda, they recognize her and after inquiring from a servant they get to know that she is in fact their step-mother. This makes them angry and initially they misbehave in response to Saeeda's motherly affection, accusing her of stealing their father from them and making their parents separate (none of them know that their mother actually left their father to prevent Baalaaj and Hooriya's marriage).\n\nAmber sees Hooriya and Minhal and recognizes them as the girls with whom Baalaaj had the brawl. Baalaaj and Hooriya also encounter each other and are shocked to learn that they are indeed cousins.\n\nBaalaaj and Hooriya's further meetings are also bloody ones. Once she is dragged by him with the arm for strolling outside the haveli in jeans and without a dupatta. The next time he doesn't allow her to have dinner before their taya has arrived at the table. Hooriya starts to hate this household within the first few days of her arrival, primarily because of Baalaaj's presence and secondly due to the rigid regulations maintained by her taya Malik Shahbaz. \n\nThe main twist occurs in the story when Malik Shahbaz decides to marry Baalaaj to his childhood fiance' Hooriya as she has now returned as part of their family. Being a staunch follower of his traditions, he doesn't even care about his daughter's happiness, who is in the process of becoming Baalaaj's bride, and gives his final decision to wed Baalaaj to his fiance'. Wajahat as before submits to his brother's command and tells his daughters. Both Hooriya and Minhal are shocked to learn about Hooriya's engagement and more shocked to know that their taya has cancelled his own daughter's marriage and instead ordered to get Hooriya married to Baalaaj. Obviously, Hooriya's response is negative. On the other hand Amber is all shattered to know what her parents are doing to her. She retaliates to her mother that she agreed to leave the man she loved for Baalaaj and now how can they take Baalaaj from her. Bi jan is also helpless. Even Baalaaj cannot support Amber as he agreed to marry her only because of his taya's orders otherwise, he never had any emotional feelings for her. Baalaaj confesses to Amber that he hates Hooriya but is doing so only on his taya's orders. Amber is heartbroken.\n\nHooriya and Minhal realize that Saeeda is not pretending to be good to them, in fact she does care for them. She even agrees to help Hooriya out of this turmoil. They make a plan to escape. As a ritual, Hooriya is taken to a shrine before her marriage and from their Saeeda makes them escape. Hooriya is in constant contact with Danish who is waiting for them. As they escape from the shrine, Baalaaj and his men catch them in the bus they are travelling and forcefully take them to a hut and lock them. There Baalaaj beats Hooriya for cursing their taya and takes her mobile away as Danish is calling her, but during all this neither Baalaaj gets to know about Hooriya's engagement to Danish nor that it is Danish to whom Hooriya is in contact with. Finally, Hooriya agrees to marry Baalaaj as he points a gun at Minhal and their Nikah is officiated under force and threat. \n\nThereon, another chapter starts in Baalaaj and Hooriya's life. Both are aggressive towards each other. Hooriya has vowed not to accept him as her husband and is rebellious at all fronts. Baalaaj on the other hand is squeezed between his anger towards Hooriya and his taya's set standards for treating a wife. He initially puts unwanted regulations on her and makes her realize that like every other woman of the haveli she is just equal to his shoes. Yet, Baalaaj maintains a distance from Hooriya, not allowing himself near her without her permission. Despite of Baalaaj and Hooriya's soft and rough skirmishes, both become habitual of each other and Hooriya also appears for her final exams. \n\nFaiq and Minhal get engaged much to Amber's shock that he has come back in her life as her cousin's fiance'. Faiq is still confused for his feelings for Amber but is determined to marry Minhal. Finally Samreen awakens from comma. Hooriya decides to take her to their house and not haveli and asks Wajahat not to tell her about Hooriya and Baalaaj's wedding before she has fully recovered. Much to Baalaaj's disapproval, Hooriya goes to her house. During her absence, Baalaaj develops some feelings for her but is unable to accept them as he recalls his taya's words that a wife is no more than a subordinate.\n\nSamreen is all the time worried about her daughters' marriages. She is keen upon marrying Hooriya and Danish at the earliest. This is not helping Hooriya who does not want to break the news of her marriage to her mother at the moment. One day Danish's mother in a fit of rage tells Samreen about Hooriya's marriage to Baalaaj. This makes Samreen collapse once again as her twenty-year old struggle went in vain. Wajahat then decides to take Samreen to the haveli as Minhal alone cannot look after her. Bi jan convinces Malik Shahbaz and he agrees too. At the haveli, Saeeda attends to Samreen and takes her responsibility. \n\nHooriya tops in her examination. Minhal makes Baalaaj realize that he should also applaud her like everyone else. He brings flower bracelets for her and somehow tells her that he specially bought them for her. Hooriya likes this gesture of his. This is the first time Hooriya feels something for Baalaaj but doesn't realize it herself. \n\nThere is a parallel story of Banu, a servant's daughter. She is in love with Waseem (Ghulam Din's son) but her father has given word of her marriage to an elderly man Qadeer. Qadeer is from rival political party, therefore, keeping their interest safe Malik Shahbaz and Baalaaj agree to marry Banu to him. They lock Banu in a stable. When Hooriya comes to know about this, she first frees Banu from her lock-up and then makes her escape with Waseem to Karachi with Danish's help. By doing this Hooriya feels at peace as she did what she could not do for herself when she was forcefully married to Baalaaj and lost her love. Hooriya confesses this to Bi jan but she does not let Malik Shahbaz know about it. \n\nOne day Baalaaj on taya's orders is going towards their rivals. Hooriya forbids him from taking a gun, once again bringing the subject of her forceful marriage to him under the influence of the same gun. When Baalaaj doesn't listen to her Hooriya angrily leaves the room saying that she does not earn that respect as a wife in his eyes as he brought her in his life forcibly. On hearing this Baalaaj drops the gun and leaves without it. When Hooriya sees it, she feels happy that Baalaaj for the first time agreed to do what she wanted. For the first time she is content about Baalaaj's act.\n\nOn his way, Baalaaj is shot in the arm by his rivals. Hooriya is worried about him being wounded like that. Baalaaj angrily blames her for his condition as she was the one who delayed his departure and not let him take his gun. He refuses to take medicine from her, but Hooriya does not give up and Baalaaj surrenders to her privilege as his wife and takes his medicine. All night long, Hooriya attends to an unconscious Baalaaj like a duty-full wife and tiredly falls asleep at his feet. When Baalaaj wakes up in the morning, he is surprised to find Hooriya near him with first aid. Later-on when Baalaaj asks her whether she is taking care of him because she has developed feelings for him, Hooriya refuses and says that she would have done the same for any other sick person and can never fall in love with him as she will never forget that he forced her to marry him, much to Baalaaj's disappointment. Hooriya then explores her feelings for Baalaaj. She is not able to accept the fact that she is drawing near to him, because the scene of her forced Nikah is still fresh in her memory. She vows in her heart not to love him ever. Yet again, she attends to her duties to the ailing Baalaaj, all the time worrying about him.\n\nBi jan wants to get Minhal married to Faiq at the earliest as Amber is giving her a tough time and she fears that she might ruin Minhal's engagement. Once their wedding date is fixed, Amber is more than outrageous. She has lost both her men to Hooriya and Minhal and plans to avenge them. She tells her father that Hooriya made Banu escape. This makes Malik Shahbaz go mad and orders Hooriya to be locked up in the same place as Banu. Saeeda informs Baalaaj about this and he interferes. He confronts his taya saying that Hooriya is his wife and he cannot let anyone harm her like that as that will be against his manhood. Malik Shahbaz though shocked at this change in Baalaaj, does not say anything more. \n\nHooriya instantly accepts her hidden feelings for Baalaaj, as it was the first time he made her know her importance in his life. She confesses to herself that she has fallen in love with him. Finally, she also admits to Baalaaj that she loves him. Baalaj at first denies his feelings for her but then fails to resist further.\n\nMalik Shahbaz is now regretting his decision of marrying Baalaaj to Hooriya as he sees that she has changed him. Amber takes advantage of this moment and makes her father realize that he is being punished for ruining his daughter's happiness. She further tells him that she likes Faiq and wants to marry him. Malik Shahbaz decides to make Faiq marry Amber instead of Minhal. He makes his men kidnap him and asks him to marry Amber. But on Faiq's refusal he makes a vicious plan. For winning the upcoming elections and for avenging Faiq for his refusal, Malik Shahbaz decides to get Faiq killed for putting the blame on his rival parties, for gaining sympathy votes, as the entire tribe and village knows that Faiq is his future son-in-law. He discusses this with Baalaaj who discourages this idea, saying that Faiq is Minhal's fiance' and an innocent man. On seeing Baalaaj's reluctance, Malik Shahbaz carries out his plan on his own and orders his men to kill Faiq, which Ghulam Din overhears. Thus, one day when Faiq is taking Samreen for her check-up, he is attacked by gunmen. In a struggle, the bullet hits Samreen and she dies. Baalaaj confronts his taya as he realizes that it was his doing. He tells him that from now on he will never participate in his wrongdoings. \n\nAfter Samreen's death, Bi jan and Saeeda decide not to delay Minhal's wedding. Malik Shahbaz cannot stop it as he knows that Baalaaj will interfere. During Danish's condolence call to Hooriya, Amber overhears her and by trick takes his phone number from her mobile. She realizes Danish to be Hooriya's former lover. She convinces him to help her stop Minhal and Faiq's marriage and in return, she will separate Baalaaj and Hooriya so that Danish can have her back in his life. Danish who is still loyal to Hooriya and is not accepting any other woman in his life, agrees to do so. Amber takes Hooriya for shopping and leaves her alone for Danish to interact with her and takes a picture of them. Danish asks Hooriya whether she is happy in her married life, to which she replies in the affirmative and tells him that she loves Baalaaj and drives him away. Danish then calls Baalaaj telling him that his wife loves someone else and is still in contact with him and sends him their picture which Amber took.\n\nBaalaaj gets suspicious. On Hooriya's questioning, he asks her whether she loved someone else. Hooriya in a shock doesn't answer at the moment but then tries to explain it to Baalaaj. But Baalaaj seems to have lost his trust in her and regrets falling in love with her. \n\nThe day of Minhal's mayun comes. Malik Shahbaz asks Bi jan to ask Faiq's mother not to bring him. Faiq is not happy to know this. Amber and Danish have a plan for stopping the ceremony. Once his mother leaves for the haveli, Danish tactfully makes Faiq to go and meet Minhal personally. Amber also convinces Minhal to let Faiq inside her room for a moment and no one shall know. \n\nBaalaaj is still not talking to Hooriya. Minhal removes his misunderstanding by telling him that Danish was their neighbor since their childhood and their mother formally fixed their engagement. She also tells him that now Hooriya only loves him and that he should never leave her or suspect her of not loving him. After this Baalaaj reconciles with Hooriya.\n\nFaiq comes to meet Minhal but is caught in her room. Malik Shahbaz is outrageous and as already does not want Minhal to marry Faiq, calls of their wedding. Amber and Danish are happy on their achievement and Amber thinks that she can get Faiq now. But due to Saeeda's insistence for her daughter's happiness, Malik Shahbaz softens and allows the marriage to proceed as planned, much to Amber's disappointment.\n\nAfter the wedding, Amber is leaving the haveli as she has lost everything. Bi jan tries to stop her but in the struggle she falls down the stairs as Amber pushes her. Bi jan dies and Amber looses her senses realizing that she has caused her mother's death. She is admitted to a mental hospital. Danish now realizing his mistake for ruining Hooriya and Minhal's lives, tells everything to Hooriya for relieving his guilt. Hooriya slashes out at him and warns him of ever coming near her again. Danish under the weight of his guilt commits suicide. \n\nOne day Malik Shahbaz's men see Waseem working in Karachi and inform him. He immediately orders them to kill both Waseem and Banu for going against his orders. Days pass and Hooriya realizes Ghulam Din being absent from his duties. She visits him at his place and he tells her that his son and Banu have been killed on Malik Shahbaz's orders. Hooriya is shattered to know this but the worst comes further as Ghulam Din discloses to her that her taya was behind her mother's murder as well. Hooriya at once confronts her taya and tells him that she will put him behind bars for these murders. Malik Shahbaz asks Baalaaj to control his wife otherwise he will do it himself. Baalaaj gets infuriated and declares war against his taya proclaiming that what he did was wrong and now whatever Hooriya will do, he will support her and between his taya and Hooriya, Baalaaj will stand like a wall. Wajahat overhears all this and squares up his brother for killing his wife. \n\nHooriya calls Baalaaj and tells him that she is about to do something terrible to which Baalaaj gives the nod and joins her at the police station, where Hooriya does a press briefing about Malik Shahbaz's wrongdoings and Baalaaj and Ghulam Din get the FIR taken for the murders. Malik Shahbaz is finally arrested.\n\nIn the last scene, it is shown that Baalaaj takes Hooriya's hand signifying that she will always be beside him in all matters, breaking the year old traditions of his family, where the wives were treated disrespectfully. Hooriya shows her gratitude towards Saeeda for being a mother to her and Minhal and that now she will take Bi jan's responsibilities. Baalaaj puts the tribal pagri on Wajahat's head saying that it belongs to him as he is the next heir and leader of the tribe after Malik Shahbaz and not Baalaaj.\n\n\n==Cast==\n* Mirza Zain Baig as Malik Baalaaj - heir of Malik Shahbaz \n*[[Azekah Daniel]] as Hooriya Wajahat - elder daughter of Malik Wajahat and his first wife Samreen and wife of Malik Baalaaj\n*[[Jahanzeb Gurchani]] as Malik Shahbaz - titled 'Malik Sarkar', he is the patriarch of the Malik family and the village head \n*Zainab Shabbir as Minhal Wajahat - Hooriya's younger sister\n*Maryam Noor as Amber Shahbaz  - only child of Malik Sarkar and first cousin of Baalaaj and Hooriya. \n*[[Sohail Sameer]] as Malik Wajahat - Malik Sarkar's younger step-brother and Hooriya and Minhal's father \n*Humera Bano as Samreen Wajahat - first wife of Malik Wajahat\n*Natasha Ali as Saeeda Wajahat - second wife of Wajahat\n*[[Seemi Pasha]] as Suraiya Shahbaz (Bi jan)- wife of Malik Sarkar and matriarch of the family \n*[[Hamza Firdous]] as Danish - Hooriya's love interest\n*Faraz Farooqui as Faiq - Amber's love interest and Minhal's fiance'\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.hum.tv/dramas/malaal-e-yaar/ Official website]\n\n{{Hum TV Programs}}\n\n[[Category:2019 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Malaal-e-Yaar (Regret of Beloved)\n| image                    = \n| caption                  = \n| show_name_2              = \n| native_name              = \n| genre                    = [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]]<br>[[Romance]]\n| creator                  = \n| based_on                 = \n| developer                = \n| writer                   = Hina Huma Nafees\n| screenplay               = \n| story                    = \n| director                 = Asad Jabbal\n| creative_director        = \n| starring                 = [[Mirza Zain Baig]]<br> Azeekah Daniel<br> Jahanzeb Gorchani\n| narrated                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = [[Ahmed Jahanzeb]]\n| opentheme                = ''Mere Yara'' by [[Ahmed Jahanzeb]] & Nish Asher\n| endtheme                 = \n| composer                 = \n| country                  = Pakistan\n| language                 = Urdu\n| num_episodes             = 54 \n| executive_producer       = \n| producer                 = \n| location                 = \n| cinematography           = Muhammad Aqeel<br>Hasnain Deswali\n| editor                   = \n| camera                   = \n| runtime                  = <!--Reliable source required-->\n| company                  = [[MD Productions]]\n| distributor              = [[Hum Network Limited]]\n| budget                   = \n| network                  = [[Hum TV]]\n| picture_format           = [[PAL]] ([[576i]])<br>[[HDTV]] [[1080i]]\n| audio_format             = [[Stereophonic sound]]\n| first_run                = <!--The nation in which the series first aired, if different from country parameter-->\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|df=y|2019|08|08}}\n| last_aired               = {{End date|df=y|2020|02|13}}\n| preceded_by              = \n| followed_by              = \n| related                  = \n| website                  = https://www.hum.tv/\n| production_website       = \n}}\n'''''Malaal e Yaar''''' is a [[Pakistani dramas|Pakistani]] television serial produced by [[Momina Duraid]] under [[MD Productions]].

The serial starts with parallel scenes of the lead characters; Baalaaj (Zain Baig) and Hooriya (Azekah Daniel). Hooriya is a headstrong young girl living in the metropolitan city of Karachi and pursuing quality education. She likes wearing western clothes and rides a bike and is always ready to do any sorts of social work. Baalaaj on the other hand is a feudal boy living in a nearby village, where his uncle Malik Shahbaz is the head of the district. Baalaaj's parents died when he was an infant and was therefore, raised up by his aunt Surraya (Malik Shahbaz's wife). Being under his uncle Malik Shahbaz's supervision, Baalaaj has apparently turned out to be ill-mannered, cruel, with a feudal mindset just like him. He even gave up his studies as education was not valuable for him being the future head of his tribe. Not known to both Baalaaj and Hooriya is that they are engaged since childhood, as Hooriya is the daughter of Malik Shahbaz's younger step-brother Malik Wajahat. \n\nWajahat (Sohail Sameer) fell in love with his college-mate Samreen (Humera Bano) and married her against the wishes of his family. His brother Malik Shahbaz (Jahanzeb Gorchani) has ever since blamed him for this act and does not give him the due recognition and respect which Wajahat deserves being part of the Malik family. In all matters of decision-making, Baalaaj is above Wajahat. Succumbing to his family's pressure, Wajahat had got married for the second time to Saeeda (Natasha Ali), a girl chosen by his brothers, even when he was a father of two daughters with Samreen. It is told that Samreen had left the haveli of her in-laws when Malik Shahbaz got engaged her eldest daughter Hooriya to his nephew Baalaaj when they were just five-year old kids. Not agreeing to this old tradition of early engagements and fearing that Baalaaj will be as orthodox as his uncle and her daughter will be just like other women of this family having no say and respect in their lives, Samreen left her husband with her daughters to live a life of seclusion, where she can give them a better future. Wajahat didn't bring her back for their own betterment but also was not strong enough to go against his brother's decisions. Unknown to his family, Wajahat secretly keeps vigilance of his wife and daughters and sends them financial assistance through his trusted slave Ghulam Din. Samreen has never told her daughters about Hooriya's engagement or about the whereabouts of their paternal family.\n\nHooriya is in love with her childhood friend Danish (Hamza Firdous) who runs a mobile shop. But Danish's mother does not like Hooriya's boldness and extrovertness. Hooriya's mother is also not in favor of Danish as she believes that if his mother does not approve of Hooriya then their marriage will not be successful. \n\nOne day, after Hooriya gives meal to an old street-seller, he is wounded by Baalaaj's speeding vehicle, engaging  him and Hooriya in a verbal brawl. Hooriya makes the wounded man to be put in Baalaaj's car and taken to hospital. In hospital she makes Baalaaj pay all expenses. Baalaaj does this unwillingly and both him and Hooriya curse each other. Hence, from their very first meeting, Baalaaj and Hooriya are are not on good terms.\n\nSurraya, called Bi jan (Seemi Pasha) wants her daughter Amber (Maryam Noor) to be married to Baalaaj. Bi jan loves Baalaaj as her own son and considers him as the best match for her daughter. Amber, unlike Baalaaj is continuing her studies and is in love with her class-fellow Faiq (Faraz Farouqi). But she is hesitant to tell about him to his family as Faiq is from middle-class and she knows that her father will never approve his proposal. Malik Shahbaz crowns Baalaaj as the head of the panchayat (ignoring Wajahat) and also commits him to his daughter, thinking that Samreen and her daughters will never come back in their lives, so Baalaaj and Hooriya's engagement is null and void. Baalaaj obediently agrees to this betrothment as his uncle's decision is the final order for him. Amber though very close to Baalaaj as a cousin, is not happy about this engagement. She tells about Faiq to Bi jan, but as expected she rejects it knowing that Malik Shahbaz will never accept a son-in-law from a lesser background. \n\nSeeing her husband's longing for his first wife and daughters, Saeeda one day visits Samreen. She asks her to return, to which Samreen refuses and asks her not to come back again. While leaving Saeeda meets Hooriya and her sister Minhal (Zainab Shabbir). She and Samreen lie to them that Saeeda is an old friend. Saeeda takes their picture for showing it to Wajahat and leaves. When she tells this to Wajahat, his reaction is not what Saeeda expected. He scolds her for interfering in his personal life and warns her not to go near his wife and daughters again. Saeeda once again realizes that only Samreen is Wajahat's love and she can never gain his trust. \n\nOne day Baalaaj and Amber are going home when due to his rash driving Baalaaj splashes water on the nearby walking Hooriya and Minhal. Hooriya as usual looses her temper and shouts at Baalaaj. Baalaaj also in a rage stops the car and gets out. Both recognize each other and start cursing once again. Amber and Minhal stop them from manhandling and they leave. Hence, the successive encounter of Baalaaj and Hooriya's is unfavorable too. \n\nDanish convinces his mother to ask Hooriya's hand in marriage and she does that reluctantly and they get engaged. Amber tells Faiq about her engagement and distances herself from him. Faiq is heart-broken to know that though he loves Amber but cannot get her due to their status difference. Faiq's mother is angry to know that Amber betrayed her son's loyalty by choosing her rich cousin over him. Danish and Faiq's mothers are relatives. They visit Samreen's place and on seeing Minhal, Faiq's mother immediately likes her. They make Faiq and Minhal meet, and Faiq for overcoming Amber's loss, develops interest in Minhal. Amber on the other hand is still in two minds in marrying Baalaaj. She asks Baalaaj to convince her father for delaying their marriage for few months to which he agrees. Amber again approaches Faiq. They both decide to run away. But on the night when Amber is leaving haveli, she is caught by Bi jan. After her mother makes her understand the importance of her background and Baalaaj as her life partner, Amber decides to stay and accepts Baalaaj as her first and last man. Faiq is waiting for her in his car but when she doesn't turn up, he is once again broken on her betrayal. \n\nPreparations start for Baalaaj and Amber's wedding. In city as well, there is a wedding which Hooriya's family is attending. During celebrations there is shooting in air and Samreen gets shot accidentally. Her condition is critical and the sisters don't have enough money for her surgery. Unwillingly, Hooriya calls Ghulam Din for help. On knowing about the accident, Wajahat arrives at the hospital and meets his daughters for the first time in years. Samreen is saved but she goes into comma. Wajahat decides to take his daughters to his haveli as he cannot leave them alone in the city. Hooriya and Minhal arrive at their paternal house on the eve of Baalaaj and Amber's mayun ceremony. Except for Saeeda no one is happy to see them there. On seeing Saeeda, they recognize her and after inquiring from a servant they get to know that she is in fact their step-mother. This makes them angry and initially they misbehave in response to Saeeda's motherly affection, accusing her of stealing their father from them and making their parents separate (none of them know that their mother actually left their father to prevent Baalaaj and Hooriya's marriage).\n\nAmber sees Hooriya and Minhal and recognizes them as the girls with whom Baalaaj had the brawl. Baalaaj and Hooriya also encounter each other and are shocked to learn that they are indeed cousins.\n\nBaalaaj and Hooriya's further meetings are also bloody ones. Once she is dragged by him with the arm for strolling outside the haveli in jeans and without a dupatta. The next time he doesn't allow her to have dinner before their taya has arrived at the table. Hooriya starts to hate this household within the first few days of her arrival, primarily because of Baalaaj's presence and secondly due to the rigid regulations maintained by her taya Malik Shahbaz. \n\nThe main twist occurs in the story when Malik Shahbaz decides to marry Baalaaj to his childhood fiance' Hooriya as she has now returned as part of their family. Being a staunch follower of his traditions, he doesn't even care about his daughter's happiness, who is in the process of becoming Baalaaj's bride, and gives his final decision to wed Baalaaj to his fiance'. Wajahat as before submits to his brother's command and tells his daughters. Both Hooriya and Minhal are shocked to learn about Hooriya's engagement and more shocked to know that their taya has cancelled his own daughter's marriage and instead ordered to get Hooriya married to Baalaaj. Obviously, Hooriya's response is negative. On the other hand Amber is all shattered to know what her parents are doing to her. She retaliates to her mother that she agreed to leave the man she loved for Baalaaj and now how can they take Baalaaj from her. Bi jan is also helpless. Even Baalaaj cannot support Amber as he agreed to marry her only because of his taya's orders otherwise, he never had any emotional feelings for her. Baalaaj confesses to Amber that he hates Hooriya but is doing so only on his taya's orders. Amber is heartbroken.\n\nHooriya and Minhal realize that Saeeda is not pretending to be good to them, in fact she does care for them. She even agrees to help Hooriya out of this turmoil. They make a plan to escape. As a ritual, Hooriya is taken to a shrine before her marriage and from their Saeeda makes them escape. Hooriya is in constant contact with Danish who is waiting for them. As they escape from the shrine, Baalaaj and his men catch them in the bus they are travelling and forcefully take them to a hut and lock them. There Baalaaj beats Hooriya for cursing their taya and takes her mobile away as Danish is calling her, but during all this neither Baalaaj gets to know about Hooriya's engagement to Danish nor that it is Danish to whom Hooriya is in contact with. Finally, Hooriya agrees to marry Baalaaj as he points a gun at Minhal and their Nikah is officiated under force and threat. \n\nThereon, another chapter starts in Baalaaj and Hooriya's life. Both are aggressive towards each other. Hooriya has vowed not to accept him as her husband and is rebellious at all fronts. Baalaaj on the other hand is squeezed between his anger towards Hooriya and his taya's set standards for treating a wife. He initially puts unwanted regulations on her and makes her realize that like every other woman of the haveli she is just equal to his shoes. Yet, Baalaaj maintains a distance from Hooriya, not allowing himself near her without her permission. Despite of Baalaaj and Hooriya's soft and rough skirmishes, both become habitual of each other and Hooriya also appears for her final exams. \n\nFaiq and Minhal get engaged much to Amber's shock that he has come back in her life as her cousin's fiance'. Faiq is still confused for his feelings for Amber but is determined to marry Minhal. Finally Samreen awakens from comma. Hooriya decides to take her to their house and not haveli and asks Wajahat not to tell her about Hooriya and Baalaaj's wedding before she has fully recovered. Much to Baalaaj's disapproval, Hooriya goes to her house. During her absence, Baalaaj develops some feelings for her but is unable to accept them as he recalls his taya's words that a wife is no more than a subordinate.\n\nSamreen is all the time worried about her daughters' marriages. She is keen upon marrying Hooriya and Danish at the earliest. This is not helping Hooriya who does not want to break the news of her marriage to her mother at the moment. One day Danish's mother in a fit of rage tells Samreen about Hooriya's marriage to Baalaaj. This makes Samreen collapse once again as her twenty-year old struggle went in vain. Wajahat then decides to take Samreen to the haveli as Minhal alone cannot look after her. Bi jan convinces Malik Shahbaz and he agrees too. At the haveli, Saeeda attends to Samreen and takes her responsibility. \n\nHooriya tops in her examination. Minhal makes Baalaaj realize that he should also applaud her like everyone else. He brings flower bracelets for her and somehow tells her that he specially bought them for her. Hooriya likes this gesture of his. This is the first time Hooriya feels something for Baalaaj but doesn't realize it herself. \n\nThere is a parallel story of Banu, a servant's daughter. She is in love with Waseem (Ghulam Din's son) but her father has given word of her marriage to an elderly man Qadeer. Qadeer is from rival political party, therefore, keeping their interest safe Malik Shahbaz and Baalaaj agree to marry Banu to him. They lock Banu in a stable. When Hooriya comes to know about this, she first frees Banu from her lock-up and then makes her escape with Waseem to Karachi with Danish's help. By doing this Hooriya feels at peace as she did what she could not do for herself when she was forcefully married to Baalaaj and lost her love. Hooriya confesses this to Bi jan but she does not let Malik Shahbaz know about it. \n\nOne day Baalaaj on taya's orders is going towards their rivals. Hooriya forbids him from taking a gun, once again bringing the subject of her forceful marriage to him under the influence of the same gun. When Baalaaj doesn't listen to her Hooriya angrily leaves the room saying that she does not earn that respect as a wife in his eyes as he brought her in his life forcibly. On hearing this Baalaaj drops the gun and leaves without it. When Hooriya sees it, she feels happy that Baalaaj for the first time agreed to do what she wanted. For the first time she is content about Baalaaj's act.\n\nOn his way, Baalaaj is shot in the arm by his rivals. Hooriya is worried about him being wounded like that. Baalaaj angrily blames her for his condition as she was the one who delayed his departure and not let him take his gun. He refuses to take medicine from her, but Hooriya does not give up and Baalaaj surrenders to her privilege as his wife and takes his medicine. All night long, Hooriya attends to an unconscious Baalaaj like a duty-full wife and tiredly falls asleep at his feet. When Baalaaj wakes up in the morning, he is surprised to find Hooriya near him with first aid. Later-on when Baalaaj asks her whether she is taking care of him because she has developed feelings for him, Hooriya refuses and says that she would have done the same for any other sick person and can never fall in love with him as she will never forget that he forced her to marry him, much to Baalaaj's disappointment. Hooriya then explores her feelings for Baalaaj. She is not able to accept the fact that she is drawing near to him, because the scene of her forced Nikah is still fresh in her memory. She vows in her heart not to love him ever. Yet again, she attends to her duties to the ailing Baalaaj, all the time worrying about him.\n\nBi jan wants to get Minhal married to Faiq at the earliest as Amber is giving her a tough time and she fears that she might ruin Minhal's engagement. Once their wedding date is fixed, Amber is more than outrageous. She has lost both her men to Hooriya and Minhal and plans to avenge them. She tells her father that Hooriya made Banu escape. This makes Malik Shahbaz go mad and orders Hooriya to be locked up in the same place as Banu. Saeeda informs Baalaaj about this and he interferes. He confronts his taya saying that Hooriya is his wife and he cannot let anyone harm her like that as that will be against his manhood. Malik Shahbaz though shocked at this change in Baalaaj, does not say anything more. \n\nHooriya instantly accepts her hidden feelings for Baalaaj, as it was the first time he made her know her importance in his life. She confesses to herself that she has fallen in love with him. Finally, she also admits to Baalaaj that she loves him. Baalaj at first denies his feelings for her but then fails to resist further.\n\nMalik Shahbaz is now regretting his decision of marrying Baalaaj to Hooriya as he sees that she has changed him. Amber takes advantage of this moment and makes her father realize that he is being punished for ruining his daughter's happiness. She further tells him that she likes Faiq and wants to marry him. Malik Shahbaz decides to make Faiq marry Amber instead of Minhal. He makes his men kidnap him and asks him to marry Amber. But on Faiq's refusal he makes a vicious plan. For winning the upcoming elections and for avenging Faiq for his refusal, Malik Shahbaz decides to get Faiq killed for putting the blame on his rival parties, for gaining sympathy votes, as the entire tribe and village knows that Faiq is his future son-in-law. He discusses this with Baalaaj who discourages this idea, saying that Faiq is Minhal's fiance' and an innocent man. On seeing Baalaaj's reluctance, Malik Shahbaz carries out his plan on his own and orders his men to kill Faiq, which Ghulam Din overhears. Thus, one day when Faiq is taking Samreen for her check-up, he is attacked by gunmen. In a struggle, the bullet hits Samreen and she dies. Baalaaj confronts his taya as he realizes that it was his doing. He tells him that from now on he will never participate in his wrongdoings. \n\nAfter Samreen's death, Bi jan and Saeeda decide not to delay Minhal's wedding. Malik Shahbaz cannot stop it as he knows that Baalaaj will interfere. During Danish's condolence call to Hooriya, Amber overhears her and by trick takes his phone number from her mobile. She realizes Danish to be Hooriya's former lover. She convinces him to help her stop Minhal and Faiq's marriage and in return, she will separate Baalaaj and Hooriya so that Danish can have her back in his life. Danish who is still loyal to Hooriya and is not accepting any other woman in his life, agrees to do so. Amber takes Hooriya for shopping and leaves her alone for Danish to interact with her and takes a picture of them. Danish asks Hooriya whether she is happy in her married life, to which she replies in the affirmative and tells him that she loves Baalaaj and drives him away. Danish then calls Baalaaj telling him that his wife loves someone else and is still in contact with him and sends him their picture which Amber took.\n\nBaalaaj gets suspicious. On Hooriya's questioning, he asks her whether she loved someone else. Hooriya in a shock doesn't answer at the moment but then tries to explain it to Baalaaj. But Baalaaj seems to have lost his trust in her and regrets falling in love with her. \n\nThe day of Minhal's mayun comes. Malik Shahbaz asks Bi jan to ask Faiq's mother not to bring him. Faiq is not happy to know this. Amber and Danish have a plan for stopping the ceremony. Once his mother leaves for the haveli, Danish tactfully makes Faiq to go and meet Minhal personally. Amber also convinces Minhal to let Faiq inside her room for a moment and no one shall know. \n\nBaalaaj is still not talking to Hooriya. Minhal removes his misunderstanding by telling him that Danish was their neighbor since their childhood and their mother formally fixed their engagement. She also tells him that now Hooriya only loves him and that he should never leave her or suspect her of not loving him. After this Baalaaj reconciles with Hooriya.\n\nFaiq comes to meet Minhal but is caught in her room. Malik Shahbaz is outrageous and as already does not want Minhal to marry Faiq, calls of their wedding. Amber and Danish are happy on their achievement and Amber thinks that she can get Faiq now. But due to Saeeda's insistence for her daughter's happiness, Malik Shahbaz softens and allows the marriage to proceed as planned, much to Amber's disappointment.\n\nAfter the wedding, Amber is leaving the haveli as she has lost everything. Bi jan tries to stop her but in the struggle she falls down the stairs as Amber pushes her. Bi jan dies and Amber looses her senses realizing that she has caused her mother's death. She is admitted to a mental hospital. Danish now realizing his mistake for ruining Hooriya and Minhal's lives, tells everything to Hooriya for relieving his guilt. Hooriya slashes out at him and warns him of ever coming near her again. Danish under the weight of his guilt commits suicide. \n\nOne day Malik Shahbaz's men see Waseem working in Karachi and inform him. He immediately orders them to kill both Waseem and Banu for going against his orders. Days pass and Hooriya realizes Ghulam Din being absent from his duties. She visits him at his place and he tells her that his son and Banu have been killed on Malik Shahbaz's orders. Hooriya is shattered to know this but the worst comes further as Ghulam Din discloses to her that her taya was behind her mother's murder as well. Hooriya at once confronts her taya and tells him that she will put him behind bars for these murders. Malik Shahbaz asks Baalaaj to control his wife otherwise he will do it himself. Baalaaj gets infuriated and declares war against his taya proclaiming that what he did was wrong and now whatever Hooriya will do, he will support her and between his taya and Hooriya, Baalaaj will stand like a wall. Wajahat overhears all this and squares up his brother for killing his wife. \n\nHooriya calls Baalaaj and tells him that she is about to do something terrible to which Baalaaj gives the nod and joins her at the police station, where Hooriya does a press briefing about Malik Shahbaz's wrongdoings and Baalaaj and Ghulam Din get the FIR taken for the murders. Malik Shahbaz is finally arrested.\n\nIn the last scene, it is shown that Baalaaj takes Hooriya's hand signifying that she will always be beside him in all matters, breaking the year old traditions of his family, where the wives were treated disrespectfully. Hooriya shows her gratitude towards Saeeda for being a mother to her and Minhal and that now she will take Bi jan's responsibilities. Baalaaj puts the tribal pagri on Wajahat's head saying that it belongs to him as he is the next heir and leader of the tribe after Malik Shahbaz and not Baalaaj.\n\n\n==Cast==\n* Mirza Zain Baig as Malik Baalaaj - heir of Malik Shahbaz \n*[[Azekah Daniel]] as Hooriya Wajahat - elder daughter of Malik Wajahat and his first wife Samreen and wife of Malik Baalaaj\n*[[Jahanzeb Gurchani]] as Malik Shahbaz - titled 'Malik Sarkar', he is the patriarch of the Malik family and the village head \n*Zainab Shabbir as Minhal Wajahat - Hooriya's younger sister\n*Maryam Noor as Amber Shahbaz  - only child of Malik Sarkar and first cousin of Baalaaj and Hooriya. \n*[[Sohail Sameer]] as Malik Wajahat - Malik Sarkar's younger step-brother and Hooriya and Minhal's father \n*Humera Bano as Samreen Wajahat - first wife of Malik Wajahat\n*Natasha Ali as Saeeda Wajahat - second wife of Wajahat\n*[[Seemi Pasha]] as Suraiya Shahbaz (Bi jan)- wife of Malik Sarkar and matriarch of the family \n*[[Hamza Firdous]] as Danish - Hooriya's love interest\n*Faraz Farooqui as Faiq - Amber's love interest and Minhal's fiance'\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.hum.tv/dramas/malaal-e-yaar/ Official website]\n\n{{Hum TV Programs}}\n\n[[Category:2019 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaal_e_Yaar"}
