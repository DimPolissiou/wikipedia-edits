The play is a farce whose plot is based on the introduction of an awkward, boorish, but honest American, Asa Trenchard, to his aristocratic English relatives when he goes to England to claim the family estate. The play premiered with great success at [[Olympic Theatre, New York|Laura Keene's Theatre]] in New York City in 1858, with Keene in the cast, the title character played by [[Joseph Jefferson]] and [[Edward Askew Sothern]], playing [[Lord Dundreary]], who eventually parlayed this supporting role into a leading one. The play's long-running 1861 London production was another decided hit.\n\nAlthough the play achieved great renown during its first few years and remained very popular throughout the second half of the 19th century, it is best remembered as the play [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] was attending in [[Ford's Theatre]] in Washington, D.C., when he was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated]] by actor and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]] on April 14, 1865.\n\n==Theatrical acclaim and \"Lord Dundreary\"==\n[[File:The autobiography of Joseph Jefferson (1890) (14758819816).jpg|thumb|Edward Sothern as Lord Dundreary, sporting \"Dundrearies\"]]\nAmong ''Our American Cousin'''s cast was British actor [[Edward Askew Sothern]], playing [[Lord Dundreary]], a caricature of a brainless English nobleman. Sothern had already achieved fame on the New York stage in the play ''[[The Lady of the Camellias|Camille]]'' in 1856, and had been reluctant to take on the role because he felt that it was too small and unimportant. He mentioned his qualms to his friend [[Joseph Jefferson]], who had been cast in the lead role, and Jefferson supposedly responded with the famous line: \"There are no small parts, only small actors.\"<ref>Havard, Bernard (2008), ''Walnut Street Theatre'', Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, p. 40, {{ISBN|978-0-7385-5770-0}}.</ref>\n\n''Our American Cousin'' premiered in New York on October 15, 1858.

Florence Trenchard, an aristocratic young beauty, loves [[Lieutenant]] Harry Vernon of the [[Royal Navy]], but she is unable to marry him until he progresses to a higher rank. She receives a letter from her brother Ned, who is currently in the United States. Ned has met some rustic cousins from a branch of the family that had immigrated to America two centuries earlier. They relay to Ned that great-uncle Mark Trenchard had, after angrily disinheriting his children and leaving England years ago, found these cousins in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]]. He had moved in with them and eventually made Asa, one of the sons, heir to his property in England. Asa is now sailing to England to claim the estate.\n\nAsa is noisy, coarse, and vulgar, but honestly forthright and colourful. The English Trenchards are alternately amused and appalled by this Vermont cousin. Richard Coyle, agent of the estate, meets with Sir Edward Trenchard (Florence's father) and tells the baronet that the family faces bankruptcy unless they can repay a debt to Coyle. Coyle is concealing the evidence that the loan had been repaid long ago by Sir Edward's late father. Coyle suggests that the loan would be satisfied if he may marry Florence, who detests him. Meanwhile, Asa and the butler, Binny, try to understand each other's unfamiliar ways, as Asa tries to understand what the purpose of a shower might be, dousing himself while fully clothed.\n\n===Act II===\nMrs. Mountchessington is staying at Trenchard Manor. She advises Augusta, her daughter, to be attentive to the presumably wealthy Vermont \"savage\". Meanwhile, her other daughter Georgina is courting an imbecilic nobleman named Dundreary by pretending to be ill. Florence's old tutor, the unhappy alcoholic Abel Murcott, warns her that Coyle intends to marry her. Asa overhears this and offers Florence his help. Murcott is Coyle's clerk and has found proof that Florence's late grandfather paid off the loan to Coyle.\n\nFlorence and Asa visit her cousin, Mary Meredith. Mary is the granddaughter of old Mark Trenchard, who left his estate to Asa. Mary is very poor and has been raised as a humble dairy maid. Asa does not care about her social status and is attracted to her. Florence has not been able to bring herself to tell Mary that her grandfather's fortune had been left to Asa. Florence tells Asa that she loves Harry, who needs a good assignment to a ship. Asa uses his country wile to persuade Dundreary to help Harry get a ship. Meanwhile, Coyle has been up to no good, and the bailiffs arrive at Trenchard Manor.\n\n===Act III===\nAt her dairy farm, Asa tells Mary about her grandfather in America, but he fibs about the end of the tale: He says that old Mark Trenchard changed his mind about disinheriting his English children and burned his will. Asa promptly burns the will himself. Florence discovers this and points it out to Mary, saying: \"It means that he is a true hero, and he loves you, you little rogue.\" Meanwhile, Mrs. Mountchessington still hopes that Asa will propose to Augusta. When Asa tells them that Mark Trenchard had left Mary his fortune, Augusta and Mrs. Mountchessington are quite rude, but Asa stands up for himself.\n\nAsa proposes to Mary and is happily accepted. He then sneaks into Coyle's office with Murcott and retrieves the paper that shows that the debt was paid. Asa confronts Coyle and insists that Coyle must pay off Sir Edward's other debts, with his doubtless ill-gotten gains, and also apologize to Florence for trying to force her into marriage. He also demands Coyle's resignation as the steward of Trenchard Manor, making Murcott steward instead. Murcott is so pleased that he vows to stop drinking. Coyle has no choice but to do all this. Florence marries Harry, Dundreary marries Georgina, and Augusta marries an old beau. Even the servants marry.\n\n==Lincoln assassination==\n[[File:American Cousin Evening Star Apr 14 1865.png|thumb|Advertisement for ''Our American Cousin'' (Washington ''[[The Washington Star|Evening Star]]'', April 14, 1865)]]\n{{main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln}}\n\nThe play's most famous performance was at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on April 14, 1865.

Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal \u2013 you [[wikt:sockdologizing|sockdologizing]] old man-trap!}}\n\nDuring the ensuing laughter, [[John Wilkes Booth]], a famous actor and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer who was not a member of the play's cast, fatally shot Lincoln in the back of the head. Familiar with the play, Booth had chosen that moment in the hope that the audience's laughter would mask the sound of his gunshot. Booth then leapt from Lincoln's box onto the stage and made his escape through the back of the theater to a horse he had left waiting in the alley. That night, the remainder of the play was suspended.<ref>Swanson, James (2006).

It looks fantastic, because you walk around, you gesture and talk to somebody that isn't there and it's quite interesting visually. To me, I'm the kind of actor who doesn't want to act towards a mark beside the camera; I want the real actor to be there, and I feed so much off the other actors. So it's very unnatural to me to do it, but since we always do the scene with the actor first I have a very clear memory and then we do it with the real actor saying the lines, so I still get a response and it becomes more like playing a game of ping pong\".<ref name=\"River media pack\">{{cite web |url= http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/river_media_pack.pdf|title= River |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | publisher= [[BBC]] | accessdate= 29 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe series used the song [[I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance)]] at the start of the first episode and at the end of the last episode.\n\n==Locations==\nFilming took place across at least eight London Boroughs - Lambeth, Islington, Camden, Hackney, Southwark, Redbridge, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Lewisham.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nNotable roads, buildings and landmarks include [[Clerkenwell Road]] in Islington, [[Southwark Park]], [[Globe Theatre]] and [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge]] in Southwark, and [[Stratford International station#Docklands Light Railway|Stratford International]] in Newham.<ref>{{cite press_release | url=https://filmfixer.co.uk/2015/10/13/londons-at-its-moody-best-in-scandi-style-river/ | title=London\u2019s at its moody best in Scandi-style River | publisher=FilmFixer | date=13 October 2015 | accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table|background=#000000|country=UK\n|overall=|title=|director=|writer=|airdate=|viewers=\n|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = Episode 1\n| DirectedBy      = Richard Laxton\n| WrittenBy       = Abi Morgan\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|10|13|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 3.88<ref name=\"BARB Top 30s\">{{cite web | url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30 | title=Weekly Top 30s | publisher=Broadcasters' Audience Research Board}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Detective Inspector John River is haunted by visions of his recently murdered colleague, Detective Sergeant Jackie 'Stevie' Stevenson.

To me, I'm the kind of actor who doesn't want to act towards a mark beside the camera; I want the real actor to be there, and I feed so much off the other actors.

During the 1930s and 1940s she starred in 29 feature films, four nominated for Best Picture Oscars (''[[The Love Parade]]'', ''[[One Hour with You]]'', ''[[Naughty Marietta (film)|Naughty Marietta]]'' and ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]''), and recorded extensively, earning three [[Music recording sales certification|gold records]]. She later appeared in opera, concerts, radio, and television. MacDonald was one of the most influential sopranos of the 20th century, introducing opera to film-going audiences and inspiring a generation of singers.\n\n==Early years==\nMacDonald was born '''Jeannette Anna McDonald'''{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=8}} on June 18, 1903, at her family's Philadelphia home at 5123 Arch Street.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=4-5}} She was the youngest of the three daughters of Anna May (n\u00e9e Wright) and Daniel McDonald, a factory foreman{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=7}} and a salesman for a [[general contractor|contracting]] household building company,{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=5}} respectively, and the younger sister of character actress [[Blossom Rock]] (born Edith McDonald), who was most famous as Grandmama on the 1960s TV series ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]''.

She took singing lessons with [[Wassili Leps]]{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=35}} and landed a job in the chorus of Ned Wayburn's ''The Demi-Tasse Revue'', a musical entertainment presented between films at the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1920, she appeared in two musicals, [[Jerome Kern]]'s ''Night Boat'' as a chorus replacement, and ''Irene'' on the road as the second female lead; future film star [[Irene Dunne]] played the title role during part of the tour,<ref>''Logansport Pharos-Tribune'', March 18, 1922</ref> and [[Helen Shipman]] played the title role during the other part of the tour. In 1921, MacDonald played in ''Tangerine'', as one of the \"Six Wives.\"{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=36}} In 1922, she was a featured singer in the Greenwich Village revue, ''Fantastic Fricassee'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=38-40}} for which good press notices brought her a role in ''The Magic Ring'' the next year.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=40-5}} MacDonald played the second female lead in this long-running musical which starred [[Mitzi Hajos]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=40-5}} In 1925, MacDonald again had the second female lead opposite [[Queenie Smith]] in ''[[Tip Toes]]'', a [[George Gershwin]] hit show.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=48-9}}\n\nThe following year, 1926, found MacDonald still in a second female lead in ''Bubblin' Over'', a musical version of ''Brewster's Millions''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=51}} MacDonald finally landed a starring role in ''Yes, Yes, Yvette'' in 1927.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=51-3}} Planned as a sequel to producer H.H. Frazee's ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'', the show toured extensively, but failed to please the critics when it arrived on Broadway. MacDonald also played the lead in her next two plays: ''Sunny Days''{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=55-6}} in 1928 for her first show for the producers Lee and J.J. Shubert, for which she received rave reviews, and ''Angela'' (1928),{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=60-2}} which the critics panned. Her last play was ''Boom Boom'' in 1929, with her name above the title; the cast included young Archie Leach, who would later become [[Cary Grant]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=62-3}}\n\nWhile MacDonald was appearing in ''Angela'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=60-2}} film star [[Richard Dix (actor)|Richard Dix]] spotted her and had her screen-tested for his film ''Nothing but the Truth''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=57}} The Shuberts would not let her out of her contract to appear in the film, which starred Dix and [[Helen Kane]] (the \"Boop-boop-a-doop girl\").{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=57}} In 1929, famed film director [[Ernst Lubitsch]] was looking through old screen tests of Broadway performers and spotted MacDonald.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=65}} He cast her as the leading lady in ''The Love Parade'', his first sound film, which starred [[Maurice Chevalier]].\n\n===Film career===\n====Paramount, controversial move to Fox Film Corporation====\nIn the first rush of sound films, during 1929 and 1930, MacDonald starred in six films, the first four for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]].

The [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]] owns the only known color print of this production.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=89}}\n\n1930 was an extremely busy year for Paramount and MacDonald. ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' was a Paramount all-star revue, similar to other mammoth sound revues produced by major studios to introduce their formerly silent stars to the public. MacDonald's footage singing a duet of \"Come Back to Sorrento\" with [[Nino Martini]] was cut from the release print due to copyright reasons with Universal Studios, which had recently gained the copyright of the song for an upcoming movie, ''King of Jazz''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=98-9}} ''[[Let's Go Native]]'' was a desert island comedy directed by [[Leo McCarey]],{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=98}} co-starring the likes of [[Jack Oakie]] and [[Kay Francis]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=357}} ''[[Monte Carlo (1930 movie)|Monte Carlo]]'' became another highly regarded Lubitsch classic, with British musical star [[Jack Buchanan]] as a count who disguises himself as a hairdresser in order to woo a scatterbrained countess (MacDonald).

Despite music by [[Rudolf Friml]], the film was not successful.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=96}} MacDonald next signed a three-picture deal with the [[Fox Film Corporation]], a controversial move in Hollywood; every other studio was far superior, in many's eyes, from their budgets to the fantastical entertainment of their films.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=102}} ''Oh, for a Man!'' (1930) was more successful; MacDonald portrayed a temperamental opera singer who sings Wagner's \"Liebestod\"{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=359}} and falls for an Irish burglar played by [[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]]. In 1931, ''Don't Bet on Women'' was a nonmusical drawing-room comedy in which a playboy ([[Edmund Lowe]]) bets his happily-married friend, ([[Roland Young]]) that he can seduce his friend's wife (MacDonald). ''[[Annabelle's Affairs]]'' (1931) was a farce with MacDonald as a sophisticated New York playgirl who does not recognize her own miner husband, played by [[Victor McLaglen]], when he turns up five years later. Although highly praised by reviewers at the time,{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=105}} only one reel of this film survives.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=359}}\n\nMacDonald took a break from Hollywood in 1931 to embark on a European concert tour, performing at the Empire Theater in Paris{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=111}} ([[Mistinguett]] and [[Morris Gest]] were said to have been in the crowd){{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=111}} and at London's [[Dominion Theatre]],{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=114}} and was invited to dinner parties with British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and French newspaper critics. She returned to Paramount the following year for two films with Chevalier. ''[[One Hour with You]]'' in 1932 was directed by both [[George Cukor]] and Ernst Lubitsch, and simultaneously filmed in French with the same stars, but a French supporting cast.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=117}} Currently, no surviving print of ''Une Heure pr\u00e8s de toi'' (''One Hour Near You'') is known. [[Rouben Mamoulian]] directed ''[[Love Me Tonight]]'' (1932), considered by many film critics and writers to be the perfect film musical.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=119}} Starring Chevalier as a humble tailor in love with a princess played by MacDonald, much of the story is told in sung dialogue. [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=360}} wrote the original score, which included the standards \"[[Mimi (song)|Mimi]]\", \"[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]\", and \"[[Isn't It Romantic?]]\".{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=360}}\n\n====MGM, Nelson Eddy partnership====\n[[File:The Merry Widow 1934.JPG|200px|left|thumb|From the trailer for ''The Merry Widow'' (1934)]]\nIn 1933, MacDonald left again for Europe and while there, signed with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Her first MGM film was ''[[The Cat and the Fiddle (film)|The Cat and the Fiddle]]'' (1934), based on the Jerome Kern Broadway hit. Her co-star was [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]]. The plot about unmarried lovers shacking up just barely slipped through the new [[Production Code]] guidelines that took effect July 1, 1934.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=135}} Despite a Technicolor finale \u2014 the first use of the new three-color Technicolor process other than Disney cartoons \u2014 the film was not a huge success. It lost $142,000.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=135}} In ''[[The Merry Widow (1934 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' (1934), director Ernst Lubitsch reunited Maurice Chevalier and MacDonald in a lavish version of the classic 1905 [[Franz Leh\u00e1r]] operetta. The film was highly regarded by critics and operetta lovers in major U.S. cities and Europe, but failed to generate much income outside urban areas, losing $113,000.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=361}} It had a huge budget of $1.6 million,{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=361}} partially because it was filmed simultaneously in French as ''La Veuve Joyeuse'', with a French supporting cast and some minor plot changes.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=362}}\n\n''Naughty Marietta'' (1935), directed by [[W. S. Van Dyke]], was MacDonald's first film in which she teamed with newcomer baritone [[Nelson Eddy]]. [[Victor Herbert]]'s 1910 score, with songs like \"Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life\", \"I'm Falling in Love with Someone\", \"'Neath the Southern Moon\", \"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp\", and \"Italian Street Song\", enjoyed renewed popularity.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=363}} The film won an Oscar for sound recording and received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=363}} It was voted one of the Ten Best Pictures of 1935 by the New York film critics, was awarded the ''[[Photoplay]]'' Gold Medal Award as Best Picture of 1935 (beating out ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', which won the Oscar),{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=159}} and in 2004, was selected to the [[National Film Registry]]. MacDonald earned gold records for \"Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life\" and \"Italian Street Song\".{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=197}} The following year, MacDonald starred in two of the highest-grossing films of that year. In ''Rose-Marie'' (1936), MacDonald played a haughty opera diva who learns her young brother (pre-famed [[James Stewart]]) has killed a Mountie and is hiding in the northern woods; Eddy is the Mountie sent to capture him. Nelson Eddy and she sang Rudolf Friml's \"[[Indian Love Call]]\" to each other in the Canadian wilderness (actually filmed at Lake Tahoe). Eddy's definitive portrayal of the steadfast Mountie became a popular icon.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=173}} When the Canadian Mounties temporarily retired their distinctive hat in 1970, photos of Eddy in his ''Rose Marie'' uniform appeared in thousands of U.S. newspapers. ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'' (1936) was also directed by W.S. Van Dyke.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=364}} In this tale of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], MacDonald played a hopeful opera singer opposite [[Clark Gable]] as the he-man proprietor of a [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco, California|Barbary Coast]] gambling joint, and [[Spencer Tracy]] as his boyhood chum who has become a priest and gives the moral messages.\n[[File:Jeanette MacDonald and Allan Jones backstage (1937).jpg|thumb|190px|MacDonald and [[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]] behind the scenes of ''The Firefly'' (1937)]]\nIn the summer of 1936, filming began on ''Maytime'', co-starring Nelson Eddy, [[Frank Morgan]], and Paul Lukas, produced by [[Irving Thalberg]]. After Thalberg's untimely death in September, the production was shut down and the half-finished film was scrapped.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=196}} A new script was filmed with a different storyline and supporting actors (including [[John Barrymore]],{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=203}} whose relationship with MacDonald strained due to his alcoholism). The 'second' ''[[Maytime (1937 film)|Maytime]]'' (1937), was the top-grossing film worldwide of the year and is regarded as one of the best film musicals of the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news|quote=Altogether, it's possible that this is one of the best and most competently handled operettas that Hollywood has turned out|title=Maytime|first= John|last= Mosher|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date= March 27, 1937|location=New York, NY|page= 70}}</ref> \"Will You Remember\" by [[Sigmund Romberg]] brought MacDonald another gold record.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=197}}\n\n''[[The Firefly (1937 film)|The Firefly]]'' (1937) was MacDonald's first solo-starring film at MGM with her name alone above the title.

The film integrated [[Victor Herbert]]'s 1913 stage score into a modern backstage story scripted by [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[Alan Campbell (screenwriter)|Alan Campbell]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=367}} MacDonald and Eddy played a husband and wife Broadway musical comedy team who are offered a Hollywood contract.

Only Eddy starred, whereas MacDonald and [[Lew Ayres]] co-starred in ''[[Broadway Serenade]]'' (1939) as a contemporary musical couple who clash when her career flourishes while his flounders. MacDonald's performance was subdued and choreographer [[Busby Berkeley]], just hired away from [[Warner Bros.]], was called upon to add an over-the-top finale in an effort to improve the film. {{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=238}} ''Broadway Serenade'' did not entice audiences in a lot of major cities,{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=237}} with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' claiming that New York, Chicago and Los Angeles' cinema attendances were \"sad\", \"slow\" and \"sour\".{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=237}}\n\nFollowing ''Broadway Serenade'', and not coincidentally right after Nelson Eddy's surprise elopement with Ann Franklin, MacDonald left Hollywood on a concert tour and refused to renew her MGM contract.

Its theme of reunion with deceased loved ones was enormously popular after the devastation of World War I, and MGM reasoned that it should resonate with filmgoers during World War II, but it failed to make a profit.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=248}} MacDonald played a dual role\u2014Moonyean, a Victorian girl accidentally murdered by a jealous lover, and Kathleen, her niece, who falls in love with the son of the murderer.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=247}}\n\n''[[I Married an Angel]]'' (1942), was adapted from the [[Rodgers & Hart]] stage musical about an angel who loses her wings on her wedding night. The script by [[Anita Loos]] suffered serious censorship cuts during filming that made the result less successful.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=257}} MacDonald sang \"Spring Is Here\" and the title song. It was the final film made by the team of MacDonald and Eddy. After a falling-out with Mayer, Eddy bought his MGM contract (with one film left to make) and went to Universal, where he signed a million-dollar, two-picture deal.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=259}} MacDonald remained for one last film, ''[[Cairo (1942 film)|Cairo]]'' (1942), a cheaply-budgeted spy comedy co-starring [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] as a reporter, and [[Ethel Waters]] as a maid, whom MacDonald personally requested.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=260}} Within one year, beginning in 1942, L.B. Mayer released his four highest-paid actresses from their MGM contracts; [[Norma Shearer]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Greta Garbo]], and Jeanette MacDonald. Of those four stars, MacDonald was the only one whom Mayer would rehire.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=259}}\n\n====Final roles====\n[[File:The Sun Comes Up 1949.JPG|right|250px|thumb|From the trailer for ''The Sun Comes Up'' (1949)]]\nAfter opening the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s membership campaign,{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=263}} MacDonald appeared as herself in ''[[Follow the Boys]]'' (1944), an all-star extravaganza about Hollywood stars entertaining the troops. The more than 40 guest stars included [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[W.C. Fields]], [[Sophie Tucker]], and [[Orson Welles]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=372}} MacDonald is shown during a concert singing \"[[Beyond the Blue Horizon (song)|Beyond the Blue Horizon]]\", and in a studio-filmed sequence singing \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" to a blinded soldier.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=268}} She returned to MGM after five years off the screen for two films. ''[[Three Daring Daughters]]'' (1948) co-starred [[Jos\u00e9 Iturbi]] as her love interest.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=372}} MacDonald plays a divorc\u00e9e whose lively daughters ([[Jane Powell]], Ann E. Todd, and [[Elinor Donahue]]) keep trying to get her back with her ex, but she has secretly remarried. \"The Dickey Bird\" song made the [[Hit Parade]]. ''[[The Sun Comes Up]]'' (1949), teamed MacDonald with [[Lassie]], in an adaptation of a short story by [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]]. MacDonald played a widow who has lost her son, but warms to orphan [[Claude Jarman Jr.]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=373}} Unfortunately, it would be her final film.\n\nShe frequently attempted a comeback movie, even financing and paying a screenwriter. One of the possible film reunions with Nelson Eddy was to be made in England, but Eddy pulled out when he learned MacDonald was investing her own funds. Eddy preferred to publicly blame the proposed project as mediocre when in fact MacDonald was uninsurable due to her heart condition. A reunion with Maurice Chevalier was also considered.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=305}} Other thwarted projects with Eddy were ''The Rosary'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=319}} ''[[The Desert Song]]'', and a remake of ''[[The Vagabond King]]'', plus two movie treatments written by Eddy for them, ''Timothy Waits for Love'' and ''All Stars Don't Spangle''. Offers continued to come in, and in 1962, producer Ross Hunter proposed MacDonald in his 1963 comedy ''[[The Thrill of It All (film)|The Thrill of It All]]'', but she declined.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=318}} 20th Century Fox also toyed with the idea of MacDonald ([[Irene Dunne]] briefly was considered) for the part of Mother Abbess in the film version of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=318}} It never moved beyond the discussion stages partly because of MacDonald's failing health.\n\nAn annual poll of film exhibitors listed MacDonald as one of the top-10 box-office draws of 1936,{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=175}} and many of her films were among the top-20 moneymakers of the years they were released.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} In addition, MacDonald was one of the top-10 box-office attractions in Great Britain from 1937 to 1942.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://legendaryjeanettemacdonald.com/filmography.html|title=Legendary Jeanette MacDonald :: Filmography|accessdate=7 April 2019}}</ref> During her 39-year career, MacDonald earned two stars in the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (for films and recordings) and planted her feet in the wet concrete in front of [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=150}}\n\n===Musical theatre===\nIn the mid-1950s, MacDonald toured in summer stock productions of ''[[Bitter Sweet]]'' and ''[[The King and I]]''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=306}} She opened in ''Bitter Sweet'' at the Iroquois Amphitheater, Louisville, Kentucky, on July 19, 1954.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=354}} Her production of ''The King and I'' opened August 20, 1956, at the [[Starlight Theatre (Kansas City)|Starlight Theatre]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=354}} While performing there, she collapsed.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=311-2}} Officially, it was announced as heat prostration, but in fact it was a heart seizure.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=311-2}} She began limiting her appearances and a reprisal of ''Bitter Sweet'' in 1959 was her last professional appearance.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=354}}\n\nMacDonald and her husband Gene Raymond toured in Ferenc Moln\u00e1r's ''[[The Guardsman]]''. The production opened at the Erlanger Theater, Buffalo, New York, on January 25, 1951, and played in 23 Northeastern and Midwestern cities until June 2, 1951.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=353}} Despite less than enthusiastic comments from critics, the show played to full houses for virtually every performance. The leading role of \"The Actress\" was changed to \"The Singer\" to allow MacDonald to add some songs. While this pleased her fans, the show closed before reaching Broadway.\n\nIn the 1950s, talks with respect to a Broadway return occurred. In the 1960s, MacDonald was approached about starring on Broadway in a musical version of ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=318}} Harold Prince recounts in his autobiography, visiting MacDonald at her home in Bel Air to discuss the proposed project.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=318}} Composer [[Hugh Martin]] also wrote a song for the musical entitled, \"Wasn't It Romantic?\".{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=318}}\n\nMacDonald also made a few nightclub appearances.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=303-4}} She sang and danced at [[Sands Hotel|The Sands]] and [[Sahara Hotel and Casino|The Sahara]] in Las Vegas in 1953, [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|The Coconut Grove]] in Los Angeles in 1954, and again at The Sahara in 1957, but she never felt entirely comfortable in the smoky atmosphere.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=303-4}}\n\n==Music career==\n[[File:Jeanette MacDonald representing the US Women's Volunteer Service.jpg|thumb|160px|MacDonald dressed in an [[American Women's Voluntary Services]] uniform]]\n\n===Concert tours, World War II charity work===\nStarting in 1931 and continuing through the 1950s, MacDonald did regular concert tours between films.

She began training for this goal with [[Lotte Lehmann]], one of the leading opera stars of the early 20th century. \"When Jeanette MacDonald approached me for coaching lessons\", wrote Lehmann, \"I was really curious how a glamorous movie star, certainly spoiled by the adoration of a limitless world, would be able to devote herself to another, a higher level of art. I had the surprise of my life. There couldn't have been a more diligent, a more serious, a more pliable person than Jeanette. The lessons which I had started with a kind of suspicious curiosity, turned out to be sheer delight for me. She studied Marguerite with me\u2014and lieder. These were the ones which astounded me most. I am quite sure that Jeanette would have developed into a serious and successful lieder singer if time would have allowed it.\"{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=269}}\n\nMacDonald made her opera debut singing Juliette in [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''[[Rom\u00e9o et Juliette]]'' in Montreal at His Majesty's Theatre (May 8, 1943).{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=265}} She quickly repeated the role in Quebec City (May 12),{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=351}} Ottawa (May 15 and 17),{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=351}} Toronto (May 20 and 22),{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=351}} and Windsor (May 24).{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=351}} Her U.S. debut with the [[Chicago Opera Company]] (November 4, 11 and 15, 1944) was in the same role.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=352}} She also sang Marguerite in Gounod's ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' with the Chicago Opera. In the summer of 1945, she appeared with [[Cincinnati Opera]] as Juliette in two performances of ''Rom\u00e9o et Juliette'' (July 10 and 25) and one as Marguerite in ''Faust'' (July 15). That November, she did two more performances of ''Rom\u00e9o et Juliette'' and one of ''Faust'' in Chicago.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=353}} On December 12, 1951, she did one performance of ''Faust'' with the [[Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company]] at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]].\n\n[[Claudia Cassidy]], the music critic of the ''Chicago Tribune'' wrote: \"Her Juliet is breathtakingly beautiful to the eye and dulcet to the ear.\"<ref>Rich (2001), p. 330</ref> The same critic reviewed ''Faust'': \"From where I sit at the opera, Jeanette MacDonald has turned out to be one of the welcome surprises of the season...her Marguerite was better than her Juliet...beautifully sung with purity of line and tone, a good trill, and a Gallic inflection that understood Gounod's phrasing...You felt if Faust must sell his soul to the devil, at least this time he got his money's worth.\"{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=277}}\n\n==Radio and television==\n[[File:Jeanette MacDonald and a CBS Radio microphone in 1937.jpg|thumb|140px|left|A promotional photo of MacDonald for ''Vick's Open House''.]]\nMacDonald's extensive radio career may have begun on a 1929 radio broadcast of the ''Publix Hour''. She was on the [[Academy Awards]] ceremony broadcast in 1931. She hosted her own radio show, ''Vicks Open House'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=218}} from September 1937 to March 1938, for which she received $5,000 a week. However, the time demands of doing a weekly live radio show while filming, touring in concerts, and making records proved enormously difficult, and after fainting on-air during one show, she decided not to renew her radio contract with Vicks at the end of the 26-week season. Thereafter, she stuck to guest appearances.\n\nMacDonald appeared in condensed radio versions of many of her films on programs such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', often with Nelson Eddy, and the ''Railroad Hour'' which starred [[Gordon MacRae]]. These included ''The Merry Widow'', ''Naughty Marietta'', ''Rose Marie'', ''Maytime'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=270}} ''Sweethearts'', ''Bitter Sweet'', ''Smilin' Through'', and ''The Sun Comes Up'', plus other operettas and musicals such as Victor Herbert's ''Mlle Modiste'', ''Irene'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=187}} ''The Student Prince'', ''Tonight or Never'' with [[Melvyn Douglas]], ''A Song for Clotilda'', ''The Gift of the Magi'', and ''Apple Blossoms''. Other radio shows included ''The Prudential Family Hour'', ''Screen Guild Playhouse'', and ''The Voice of Firestone'' which featured the top opera and concert singers of the time. In 1953, MacDonald sang \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" at the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, broadcast on both radio and TV.\n\nMacDonald sang frequently with Nelson Eddy during the mid-1940s on several ''Lux Radio Theater'' and ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' productions of their films together. She also appeared as his guest several times on his various radio shows such as ''[[The Electric Hour]]'' and ''The Kraft Music Hall''. He was also a surprise guest when she hosted a war bonds program called ''Guest Star'', and they sang on other World War II victory shows together. The majority of her radio work in the mid to late 1940s was with Eddy. Her 1948 Hollywood Bowl concert was also broadcast over the air, in which she used Eddy's longtime accompanist, Theodore Paxson.\n\nMacDonald appeared on early TV, most frequently as a singing guest star. She sang on ''The Voice of Firestone'' on November 13, 1950.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=296}} On November 12, 1952, she was the subject of Ralph Edwards' ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=301}} Her surprise guests included her sisters, a sailor she danced with at the Hollywood Canteen, her former English teacher, her husband, and the reverend that married them, and Nelson Eddy appeared as a voice from her past, singing the song he sang at her wedding; his surprise appearance brought her to tears. Shortly thereafter, she appeared as the mystery guest on the December 21, 1952, episode of ''[[What's My Line?]]''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=296}} After the panelists guessed her identity, she told [[John Charles Daly|John Daly]] she was in New York for the holidays and would have a recital at Carnegie Hall on January 16. On February 2, 1956, MacDonald starred in ''Prima Donna'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=310}} a television pilot for her own series, written for her by her husband, Gene Raymond. The initial show featured guest stars [[Leo Durocher]] and Larraine Day, but it failed to find a slot. In December 1956 MacDonald and Eddy made their first TV appearance as a team on the ''Lux Video Theatre Holiday Special''. In 1957, Eddy and she appeared on [[Patti Page]]'s program ''The Big Record'', singing several songs.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=313}} On ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' (March 28, 1957), MacDonald played Charley's real aunt to [[Art Carney]]'s impersonation in \"Charley's Aunt\".{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=310}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Jeanette MacDonald and her sisters.jpg|thumb|MacDonald (right) with her sisters Blossom Rock (middle) and Elsie.]]\nWhen MacDonald was born, her father quickly doted on her.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=6}} Although he had hoped for a son who would pursue \"an [[American dream]]\" life that he believed he had failed to live himself, he advised his three daughters to do this instead.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=6}} MacDonald was the only daughter in the family that had inherited both her father's red hair and blue-green eyes,{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=5}} although she often Admired her sisters' beauty, such as Blossom's dimples{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=19}} and her eldest sister Elsie's (1893{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=6}}\u20141970{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=333}}) blonde hair and blue eyes.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=14}} Elsie could play the piano and taught toddler MacDonald a variety of popular waltzes and [[Stephen Foster]]'s composes.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=10}} At this time, MacDonald discovered that she was an extrovert who enjoyed socializing with friends and performing for others, admitting that \"[I] needed people to watch and applaud me as much as I needed food and drink.\"{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=9}} At the end of her first performance in the local church as a child, \"I paused ever so slightly and then, when I realized they needed prodding, I promptly began clapping my hands and said to the congregation, 'Now everybody's got to clap!'\"{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=10}}\n\nMacDonald cited the number thirteen as her lucky number.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=144}} Her characters always had a name beginning with M, the first letter of her surname and the 13th letter of the English alphabet, which she had insisted.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=144}} Interestingly, thirteen became a recurring number throughout her life, such as the thirteen-year gap between her overseas tours in Europe;{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=279}} [[principal photography]] for ''The Merry Widow'' had taken thirteen weeks to film;{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=144}} her first movie, ''The Love Parade'', was the number one box-office draw for 13 weeks;{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=87}} MacDonald performed opera for the first time for a screen test thirteen years after meeting Newell (who was also on set);{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=182}} the thirteen-year gap between her and sister Blossom's death;{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=333}} and husband Gene Raymond's birthday was August 13.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=165}}\n[[File:Harriet Kreisler, Mary Pickford, Gloria Swanson and Jeanette MacDonald.jpg|thumb|left|250px|MacDonald (right), with Harriet Kriesler, [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Gloria Swanson]] at the Stork Club in 1944.]]\nOn sets, MacDonald would never [[lip-sync]] and she sang along to song playbacks during filming, which Lew Ayres discovered when he starred alongside her in ''Broadway Serenade'' and was supplied with earplugs after the volume was making him nauseous.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=239}} \n[[File:Jeanette MacDonald with her three pet dogs.jpg|thumb|250px|MacDonald playing with three of her dogs in the Twin Gables garden.

In 1938, they had a small Burbank house located at 812 S Mariposa Street in Burbank. In the 1940s, Nelson leased and remodeled for himself and MacDonald the old cowboy bunkhouse at 1330 Angelo Drive, Beverly Hills. Starting in 1947, they used 710 N.

They also alternately stayed at favorite hotels and homes across the country owned by their celebrity friends including [[Lily Pons]] and [[Irene Dunne]]. In 1963, MacDonald and Raymond moved into two adjoining apartments at the Wilshire Comstock in Westwood. They were on the 8th floor in the East building. Nelson Eddy had his own apartment on the 7th floor of the West building and allowed MacDonald to decorate it; they used it as a rendezvous spot until she was too weak to walk the few yards over to his building.

During the 1930s and 1940s she starred in 29 feature films, four nominated for Best Picture Oscars (''[[The Love Parade]]'', ''[[One Hour with You]]'', ''[[Naughty Marietta (film)|Naughty Marietta]]'' and ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]''), and recorded extensively, earning three [[Music recording sales certification|gold records]]. She later appeared in opera, concerts, radio, and television. MacDonald was one of the most influential sopranos of the 20th century, introducing opera to film-going audiences and inspiring a generation of singers.\n\n==Early years==\nMacDonald was born '''Jeannette Anna McDonald'''{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=8}} on June 18, 1903, at her family's Philadelphia home at 5123 Arch Street.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=4-5}} She was the youngest of the three daughters of Anna May (n\u00e9e Wright) and Daniel McDonald, a factory foreman{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=7}} and a salesman for a [[general contractor|contracting]] household building company,{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=5}} respectively, and the younger sister of character actress [[Blossom Rock]] (born Edith McDonald), who was most famous as Grandmama on the 1960s TV series ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]''. She had Scottish, English, and Dutch ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legendaryjeanettemacdonald.com/earlyyears.html|title=The Iron Butterfly :: Early Years|publisher=Legendary Jeanette MacDonald |first=Pierre|last=Montiel|date=|accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref> The extra N in her forename was later dropped for simplicity's sake{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=8}} and A was added to her surname to emphasize her Scottish heritage.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=8}} Starting at an early age, she took dancing lessons with Al White, imitated her neighbors' opera records,{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=11}} performed at church and school functions, and began touring in kiddie shows, heading Al White's \"Six Little Song Birds\" in Philadelphia at the age of nine.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=20}}\n\n==Acting career==\n===Broadway===\n[[File:Jeanette MacDonald in costume for a Broadway show.jpg|thumb|MacDonald backstage in a costume for the Broadway show ''Sunny Days'' (1928).]]\nIn November 1919, MacDonald joined her older sister Blossom in New York. She took singing lessons with [[Wassili Leps]]{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=35}} and landed a job in the chorus of Ned Wayburn's ''The Demi-Tasse Revue'', a musical entertainment presented between films at the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1920, she appeared in two musicals, [[Jerome Kern]]'s ''Night Boat'' as a chorus replacement, and ''Irene'' on the road as the second female lead; future film star [[Irene Dunne]] played the title role during part of the tour,<ref>''Logansport Pharos-Tribune'', March 18, 1922</ref> and [[Helen Shipman]] played the title role during the other part of the tour. In 1921, MacDonald played in ''Tangerine'', as one of the \"Six Wives.\"{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=36}} In 1922, she was a featured singer in the Greenwich Village revue, ''Fantastic Fricassee'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=38-40}} for which good press notices brought her a role in ''The Magic Ring'' the next year.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=40-5}} MacDonald played the second female lead in this long-running musical which starred [[Mitzi Hajos]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=40-5}} In 1925, MacDonald again had the second female lead opposite [[Queenie Smith]] in ''[[Tip Toes]]'', a [[George Gershwin]] hit show.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=48-9}}\n\nThe following year, 1926, found MacDonald still in a second female lead in ''Bubblin' Over'', a musical version of ''Brewster's Millions''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=51}} MacDonald finally landed a starring role in ''Yes, Yes, Yvette'' in 1927.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=51-3}} Planned as a sequel to producer H.H. Frazee's ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'', the show toured extensively, but failed to please the critics when it arrived on Broadway. MacDonald also played the lead in her next two plays: ''Sunny Days''{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=55-6}} in 1928 for her first show for the producers Lee and J.J. Shubert, for which she received rave reviews, and ''Angela'' (1928),{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=60-2}} which the critics panned. Her last play was ''Boom Boom'' in 1929, with her name above the title; the cast included young Archie Leach, who would later become [[Cary Grant]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=62-3}}\n\nWhile MacDonald was appearing in ''Angela'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=60-2}} film star [[Richard Dix (actor)|Richard Dix]] spotted her and had her screen-tested for his film ''Nothing but the Truth''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=57}} The Shuberts would not let her out of her contract to appear in the film, which starred Dix and [[Helen Kane]] (the \"Boop-boop-a-doop girl\").{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=57}} In 1929, famed film director [[Ernst Lubitsch]] was looking through old screen tests of Broadway performers and spotted MacDonald.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=65}} He cast her as the leading lady in ''The Love Parade'', his first sound film, which starred [[Maurice Chevalier]].\n\n===Film career===\n====Paramount, controversial move to Fox Film Corporation====\nIn the first rush of sound films, during 1929 and 1930, MacDonald starred in six films, the first four for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]]. Her first, ''[[The Love Parade]]'' (1929), directed by [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and co-starring [[Maurice Chevalier]], was a landmark of early sound films and received a Best Picture nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/100446/The-Love-Parade/awards |title=The-Love-Parade \u2013 Cast, Crew, Director and Awards |publisher=NYTimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref> MacDonald's first recordings for RCA Victor were two hits from the score: \"Dream Lover\" and \"March of the Grenadiers\".{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=80}} ''[[The Vagabond King (1930 film)|The Vagabond King]]'' (1930) was a lavish two-strip [[Technicolor]] film version of [[Rudolf Friml]]'s hit 1925 operetta.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=89}} Broadway star [[Dennis King]] reprised his role as 15th-century French poet [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]] and MacDonald was Princess Katherine.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=91}} She sang \"[[Some Day (1925 song)|Some Day]]\" and \"Only a Rose\". The [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]] owns the only known color print of this production.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=89}}\n\n1930 was an extremely busy year for Paramount and MacDonald. ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' was a Paramount all-star revue, similar to other mammoth sound revues produced by major studios to introduce their formerly silent stars to the public. MacDonald's footage singing a duet of \"Come Back to Sorrento\" with [[Nino Martini]] was cut from the release print due to copyright reasons with Universal Studios, which had recently gained the copyright of the song for an upcoming movie, ''King of Jazz''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=98-9}} ''[[Let's Go Native]]'' was a desert island comedy directed by [[Leo McCarey]],{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=98}} co-starring the likes of [[Jack Oakie]] and [[Kay Francis]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=357}} ''[[Monte Carlo (1930 movie)|Monte Carlo]]'' became another highly regarded Lubitsch classic, with British musical star [[Jack Buchanan]] as a count who disguises himself as a hairdresser in order to woo a scatterbrained countess (MacDonald). MacDonald introduced \"[[Beyond the Blue Horizon (song)|Beyond the Blue Horizon]]\", which she recorded three times during her career, including performing it for the [[Hollywood Victory Committee]] film ''Follow the Boys''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=268}}\n[[File:Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald in The Merry Widow.jpg|thumb|MacDonald with Maurice Chevalier in a promotional still for ''The Merry Widow'' (1934)]]\nIn hopes of producing her own films, MacDonald went to [[United Artists]] to make ''[[The Lottery Bride]]'' in 1930. Despite music by [[Rudolf Friml]], the film was not successful.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=96}} MacDonald next signed a three-picture deal with the [[Fox Film Corporation]], a controversial move in Hollywood; every other studio was far superior, in many's eyes, from their budgets to the fantastical entertainment of their films.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=102}} ''Oh, for a Man!'' (1930) was more successful; MacDonald portrayed a temperamental opera singer who sings Wagner's \"Liebestod\"{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=359}} and falls for an Irish burglar played by [[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]]. In 1931, ''Don't Bet on Women'' was a nonmusical drawing-room comedy in which a playboy ([[Edmund Lowe]]) bets his happily-married friend, ([[Roland Young]]) that he can seduce his friend's wife (MacDonald). ''[[Annabelle's Affairs]]'' (1931) was a farce with MacDonald as a sophisticated New York playgirl who does not recognize her own miner husband, played by [[Victor McLaglen]], when he turns up five years later. Although highly praised by reviewers at the time,{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=105}} only one reel of this film survives.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=359}}\n\nMacDonald took a break from Hollywood in 1931 to embark on a European concert tour, performing at the Empire Theater in Paris{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=111}} ([[Mistinguett]] and [[Morris Gest]] were said to have been in the crowd){{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=111}} and at London's [[Dominion Theatre]],{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=114}} and was invited to dinner parties with British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and French newspaper critics. She returned to Paramount the following year for two films with Chevalier. ''[[One Hour with You]]'' in 1932 was directed by both [[George Cukor]] and Ernst Lubitsch, and simultaneously filmed in French with the same stars, but a French supporting cast.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=117}} Currently, no surviving print of ''Une Heure pr\u00e8s de toi'' (''One Hour Near You'') is known. [[Rouben Mamoulian]] directed ''[[Love Me Tonight]]'' (1932), considered by many film critics and writers to be the perfect film musical.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=119}} Starring Chevalier as a humble tailor in love with a princess played by MacDonald, much of the story is told in sung dialogue. [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=360}} wrote the original score, which included the standards \"[[Mimi (song)|Mimi]]\", \"[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]\", and \"[[Isn't It Romantic?]]\".{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=360}}\n\n====MGM, Nelson Eddy partnership====\n[[File:The Merry Widow 1934.JPG|200px|left|thumb|From the trailer for ''The Merry Widow'' (1934)]]\nIn 1933, MacDonald left again for Europe and while there, signed with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Her first MGM film was ''[[The Cat and the Fiddle (film)|The Cat and the Fiddle]]'' (1934), based on the Jerome Kern Broadway hit. Her co-star was [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]]. The plot about unmarried lovers shacking up just barely slipped through the new [[Production Code]] guidelines that took effect July 1, 1934.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=135}} Despite a Technicolor finale \u2014 the first use of the new three-color Technicolor process other than Disney cartoons \u2014 the film was not a huge success. It lost $142,000.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=135}} In ''[[The Merry Widow (1934 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' (1934), director Ernst Lubitsch reunited Maurice Chevalier and MacDonald in a lavish version of the classic 1905 [[Franz Leh\u00e1r]] operetta. The film was highly regarded by critics and operetta lovers in major U.S. cities and Europe, but failed to generate much income outside urban areas, losing $113,000.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=361}} It had a huge budget of $1.6 million,{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=361}} partially because it was filmed simultaneously in French as ''La Veuve Joyeuse'', with a French supporting cast and some minor plot changes.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=362}}\n\n''Naughty Marietta'' (1935), directed by [[W. S. Van Dyke]], was MacDonald's first film in which she teamed with newcomer baritone [[Nelson Eddy]]. [[Victor Herbert]]'s 1910 score, with songs like \"Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life\", \"I'm Falling in Love with Someone\", \"'Neath the Southern Moon\", \"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp\", and \"Italian Street Song\", enjoyed renewed popularity.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=363}} The film won an Oscar for sound recording and received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=363}} It was voted one of the Ten Best Pictures of 1935 by the New York film critics, was awarded the ''[[Photoplay]]'' Gold Medal Award as Best Picture of 1935 (beating out ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', which won the Oscar),{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=159}} and in 2004, was selected to the [[National Film Registry]]. MacDonald earned gold records for \"Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life\" and \"Italian Street Song\".{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=197}} The following year, MacDonald starred in two of the highest-grossing films of that year. In ''Rose-Marie'' (1936), MacDonald played a haughty opera diva who learns her young brother (pre-famed [[James Stewart]]) has killed a Mountie and is hiding in the northern woods; Eddy is the Mountie sent to capture him. Nelson Eddy and she sang Rudolf Friml's \"[[Indian Love Call]]\" to each other in the Canadian wilderness (actually filmed at Lake Tahoe). Eddy's definitive portrayal of the steadfast Mountie became a popular icon.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=173}} When the Canadian Mounties temporarily retired their distinctive hat in 1970, photos of Eddy in his ''Rose Marie'' uniform appeared in thousands of U.S. newspapers.

Its theme of reunion with deceased loved ones was enormously popular after the devastation of World War I, and MGM reasoned that it should resonate with filmgoers during World War II, but it failed to make a profit.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=248}} MacDonald played a dual role\u2014Moonyean, a Victorian girl accidentally murdered by a jealous lover, and Kathleen, her niece, who falls in love with the son of the murderer.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=247}}\n\n''[[I Married an Angel]]'' (1942), was adapted from the [[Rodgers & Hart]] stage musical about an angel who loses her wings on her wedding night.

It was the final film made by the team of MacDonald and Eddy. After a falling-out with Mayer, Eddy bought his MGM contract (with one film left to make) and went to Universal, where he signed a million-dollar, two-picture deal.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=259}} MacDonald remained for one last film, ''[[Cairo (1942 film)|Cairo]]'' (1942), a cheaply-budgeted spy comedy co-starring [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] as a reporter, and [[Ethel Waters]] as a maid, whom MacDonald personally requested.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=260}} Within one year, beginning in 1942, L.B.

''[[The Sun Comes Up]]'' (1949), teamed MacDonald with [[Lassie]], in an adaptation of a short story by [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]]. MacDonald played a widow who has lost her son, but warms to orphan [[Claude Jarman Jr.]].{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=373}} Unfortunately, it would be her final film.\n\nShe frequently attempted a comeback movie, even financing and paying a screenwriter. One of the possible film reunions with Nelson Eddy was to be made in England, but Eddy pulled out when he learned MacDonald was investing her own funds. Eddy preferred to publicly blame the proposed project as mediocre when in fact MacDonald was uninsurable due to her heart condition. A reunion with Maurice Chevalier was also considered.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=305}} Other thwarted projects with Eddy were ''The Rosary'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=319}} ''[[The Desert Song]]'', and a remake of ''[[The Vagabond King]]'', plus two movie treatments written by Eddy for them, ''Timothy Waits for Love'' and ''All Stars Don't Spangle''.

The leading role of \"The Actress\" was changed to \"The Singer\" to allow MacDonald to add some songs. While this pleased her fans, the show closed before reaching Broadway.\n\nIn the 1950s, talks with respect to a Broadway return occurred. In the 1960s, MacDonald was approached about starring on Broadway in a musical version of ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=318}} Harold Prince recounts in his autobiography, visiting MacDonald at her home in Bel Air to discuss the proposed project.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=318}} Composer [[Hugh Martin]] also wrote a song for the musical entitled, \"Wasn't It Romantic?\".{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=318}}\n\nMacDonald also made a few nightclub appearances.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=303-4}} She sang and danced at [[Sands Hotel|The Sands]] and [[Sahara Hotel and Casino|The Sahara]] in Las Vegas in 1953, [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|The Coconut Grove]] in Los Angeles in 1954, and again at The Sahara in 1957, but she never felt entirely comfortable in the smoky atmosphere.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=303-4}}\n\n==Music career==\n[[File:Jeanette MacDonald representing the US Women's Volunteer Service.jpg|thumb|160px|MacDonald dressed in an American Women's Volunteer Service uniform]]\n\n===Concert tours, World War II charity work===\nStarting in 1931 and continuing through the 1950s, MacDonald did regular concert tours between films.

She began training for this goal with [[Lotte Lehmann]], one of the leading opera stars of the early 20th century. \"When Jeanette MacDonald approached me for coaching lessons\", wrote Lehmann, \"I was really curious how a glamorous movie star, certainly spoiled by the adoration of a limitless world, would be able to devote herself to another, a higher level of art. I had the surprise of my life. There couldn't have been a more diligent, a more serious, a more pliable person than Jeanette. The lessons which I had started with a kind of suspicious curiosity, turned out to be sheer delight for me. She studied Marguerite with me\u2014and lieder.

In the summer of 1945, she appeared with [[Cincinnati Opera]] as Juliette in two performances of ''Rom\u00e9o et Juliette'' (July 10 and 25) and one as Marguerite in ''Faust'' (July 15). That November, she did two more performances of ''Rom\u00e9o et Juliette'' and one of ''Faust'' in Chicago.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=353}} On December 12, 1951, she did one performance of ''Faust'' with the [[Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company]] at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]].\n\n[[Claudia Cassidy]], the music critic of the ''Chicago Tribune'' wrote: \"Her Juliet is breathtakingly beautiful to the eye and dulcet to the ear.\"<ref>Rich (2001), p. 330</ref> The same critic reviewed ''Faust'': \"From where I sit at the opera, Jeanette MacDonald has turned out to be one of the welcome surprises of the season...her Marguerite was better than her Juliet...beautifully sung with purity of line and tone, a good trill, and a Gallic inflection that understood Gounod's phrasing...You felt if Faust must sell his soul to the devil, at least this time he got his money's worth.\"{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=277}}\n\n==Radio and television==\n[[File:Jeanette MacDonald and a CBS Radio microphone in 1937.jpg|thumb|140px|left|A promotional photo of MacDonald for ''Vick's Open House''.]]\nMacDonald's extensive radio career may have begun on a 1929 radio broadcast of the ''Publix Hour''. She was on the [[Academy Awards]] ceremony broadcast in 1931. She hosted her own radio show, ''Vicks Open House'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=218}} from September 1937 to March 1938, for which she received $5,000 a week. However, the time demands of doing a weekly live radio show while filming, touring in concerts, and making records proved enormously difficult, and after fainting on-air during one show, she decided not to renew her radio contract with Vicks at the end of the 26-week season. Thereafter, she stuck to guest appearances.\n\nMacDonald appeared in condensed radio versions of many of her films on programs such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', often with Nelson Eddy, and the ''Railroad Hour'' which starred [[Gordon MacRae]]. These included ''The Merry Widow'', ''Naughty Marietta'', ''Rose Marie'', ''Maytime'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=270}} ''Sweethearts'', ''Bitter Sweet'', ''Smilin' Through'', and ''The Sun Comes Up'', plus other operettas and musicals such as Victor Herbert's ''Mlle Modiste'', ''Irene'',{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=187}} ''The Student Prince'', ''Tonight or Never'' with [[Melvyn Douglas]], ''A Song for Clotilda'', ''The Gift of the Magi'', and ''Apple Blossoms''. Other radio shows included ''The Prudential Family Hour'', ''Screen Guild Playhouse'', and ''The Voice of Firestone'' which featured the top opera and concert singers of the time. In 1953, MacDonald sang \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" at the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, broadcast on both radio and TV.\n\nMacDonald sang frequently with Nelson Eddy during the mid-1940s on several ''Lux Radio Theater'' and ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' productions of their films together. She also appeared as his guest several times on his various radio shows such as ''[[The Electric Hour]]'' and ''The Kraft Music Hall''. He was also a surprise guest when she hosted a war bonds program called ''Guest Star'', and they sang on other World War II victory shows together. The majority of her radio work in the mid to late 1940s was with Eddy. Her 1948 Hollywood Bowl concert was also broadcast over the air, in which she used Eddy's longtime accompanist, Theodore Paxson.\n\nMacDonald appeared on early TV, most frequently as a singing guest star. She sang on ''The Voice of Firestone'' on November 13, 1950.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=296}} On November 12, 1952, she was the subject of Ralph Edwards' ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=301}} Her surprise guests included her sisters, a sailor she danced with at the Hollywood Canteen, her former English teacher, her husband, and the reverend that married them, and Nelson Eddy appeared as a voice from her past, singing the song he sang at her wedding; his surprise appearance brought her to tears. Shortly thereafter, she appeared as the mystery guest on the December 21, 1952, episode of ''[[What's My Line?]]''.{{sfn|Hollywood Diva, 1998|page=296}} After the panelists guessed her identity, she told [[John Charles Daly|John Daly]] she was in New York for the holidays and would have a recital at Carnegie Hall on January 16.

In 1963, MacDonald and Raymond moved into two adjoining apartments at the Wilshire Comstock in Westwood. They were on the 8th floor in the East building.
