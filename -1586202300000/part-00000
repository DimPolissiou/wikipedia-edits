The differences in this case were more substantial and more complex, resulting from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and the differences in quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources. Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. It was finally agreed that the allocation of energy credit (subtracting it from inputs) for byproducts in the production of fuels from cellulosic crops as opposed to counting the energy needed for those same byproducts is the main philosophical difference in Pimentel and his associates calculating a negative net energy ratio while others make different choices which yield positive ratios.<ref>Hall, C.A.S., Dale, B.E., and D.

The differences in this case were more substantial and more complex, resulting from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and the differences in quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources. Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. It was finally agreed that the allocation of energy credit (subtracting it from inputs) for byproducts in the production of fuels from cellulosic crops as opposed to counting the energy needed for those same byproducts is the main philosophical difference in Pimentel and his associates calculating a negative net energy ratio while others make different choices which yield positive ratios.<ref>Hall, C.A.S., Dale, B.E., and D.

She refused to be confirmed by Dalton, officially left the church at age 16, but remained interested in intellectual pursuits in the areas of philosophy, literature and religion.\n\nIn fact, she was fascinated by the sermons of the Dutch pastor Hendrik Gillot, known in St. Petersburg as an opponent of Dalton's. Gillot, 25 years her senior, took her on as a student, engaging with her in the fields of theology, philosophy, world religions, and French and [[German literature]]. Together they studied innumerable authors, philosophers, theological and religious subjects, and all of this wide-ranging study laid the groundwork for her intellectual encounters with very well-known thinkers of her time. Gillot became so smitten with Salom\u00e9 that he wanted to divorce his wife and marry his young student. Salom\u00e9 refused, for she was not interested in marriage and sexual relations.  Though disappointed and shocked by this development, she remained friends with Gillot.\n\nFollowing her father's death in 1879, Salom\u00e9 and her mother went to [[Zurich]], so Salom\u00e9 could acquire a university education as a \"guest student\". In her one year at the [[University of Zurich]]--one of the few schools that accepted female students--Salom\u00e9 attended lectures in philosophy (logic, history of philosophy, ancient philosophy, and psychology) and theology (dogmatics). During this time, Salom\u00e9's physical health was failing due to a lung disease, causing her to cough up blood. Due to this, she was instructed to heal in warmer climates, so in February 1882, Salom\u00e9 and her mother went to Rome.\n\n[[File:Nietzsche paul-ree lou-von-salome188.jpg|thumb|Left to right, Andreas-Salom\u00e9, R\u00e9e and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] (1882)]]\n\n===R\u00e9e and Nietzsche, and later life===\nSalom\u00e9's mother took her to Rome when Salom\u00e9 was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salom\u00e9 became acquainted with the author [[Paul R\u00e9e]]. R\u00e9e proposed to her, but she instead suggested that they live and study together as 'brother and sister' along with another man for company, and thereby establish an academic commune.<ref name=\"Nietzsche 1999 page 149\">''Nietzsche: The Man and his Philosophy'', by R.J. Hollingdale (Cambridge University Press 1999), page 149</ref> R\u00e9e accepted the idea, and suggested that they be joined by his friend [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salom\u00e9, as R\u00e9e had earlier done.  Nietzsche asked R\u00e9e to propose marriage to Salom\u00e9 on his behalf, which she rejected. She had been interested in Nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband.<ref name=\"Nietzsche 1999 page 149\"/> Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join R\u00e9e and Salom\u00e9 touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune. On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salom\u00e9, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, and she again rejected him. He was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune.<ref name=\"Nietzsche 1999 page 149\"/> After discovering the situation, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth became determined to get Nietzsche away from what she described as the \"immoral woman\".<ref>''Nietzsche: The Man and his Philosophy'', by R.J. Hollingdale (Cambridge University Press 1999), page 151</ref> The three traveled with Salom\u00e9's mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their \"Winterplan\" commune.  This commune was intended to be set up in an abandoned monastery, but as no suitable location was found, the plan was abandoned.\n\nAfter arriving in [[Leipzig]] in October 1882, the three spent a number of weeks together. However, the following month R\u00e9e and Salom\u00e9 parted company with Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to R\u00e9e, asking him, \"We shall see one another from time to time, won't we?\"<ref name=\"Nietzsche 1999 page 152\">''Nietzsche: The Man and his Philosophy'', by R.J. Hollingdale (Cambridge University Press 1999), page 152</ref> In later recriminations, Nietzsche would blame the failure in his attempts to woo Salom\u00e9 both on Salom\u00e9, R\u00e9e, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the families of Salom\u00e9 and R\u00e9e to disrupt their plans for the commune). Nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883 that he felt \"genuine hatred for [his] sister\".<ref name=\"Nietzsche 1999 page 152\"/>\n\nSalom\u00e9 would later (1894) write a study, ''Friedrich Nietzsche in seinen Werken'' (''Friedrich Nietzsche in his Works''), of Nietzsche's personality and philosophy.<ref>Salom\u00e9, 2001</ref>\n\nIn 1884 Salom\u00e9 became acquainted with [[Helene von Druskowitz]], the second woman to receive a philosophy doctorate in Zurich.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} It was also rumored that Salom\u00e9 later had a romantic relationship with Sigmund Freud.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Borossa|first1=Julia|last2=Rooney|first2=Caroline|title=Suffering, Transience and Immortal Longings Salom\u00e9 Between Neitzsche and Freud|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=MultiTab&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CA112483589&docType=Article&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=LitRC&contentSet=GALE%7CA112483589&searchId=R5&userGroupName=newpaltz&inPS=true|website=The Gale Group|publisher=Sage Publications|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and relationships ===\nSalom\u00e9 and R\u00e9e moved to [[Berlin]] and lived together until a few years before her celibate marriage<ref name=Anderson>Mark M.

Despite her opposition to marriage and her open relationships with other men, Salom\u00e9 and Andreas remained married from 1887 until his death in 1930.\n\nSalom\u00e9's co-habitation with Andreas caused the despairing R\u00e9e to fade from Salom\u00e9's life despite her assurances. Throughout her married life, she engaged in affairs or/and correspondence with the German journalist and politician [[Georg Ledebour]], the German poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], about whom she wrote an analytical memoir,<ref>Andreas-Salom\u00e9, 2003</ref> the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]] [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Victor Tausk]], among others.<!-- (not clear whether she did and with whom) --> Accounts of many of these are given in her volume ''[[Lebensr\u00fcckblick]]''. Her relationship with Freud was still quite intellectual despite gossip about their romantic involvement.

She refused to be confirmed by Dalton, officially left the church at age 16, but remained interested in intellectual pursuits in the areas of philosophy, literature and religion.\n\nIn fact, she was fascinated by the sermons of the Dutch pastor Hendrik Gillot, known in St. Petersburg as an opponent of Dalton's. Gillot, 25 years her senior, took her on as a student, engaging with her in the fields of theology, philosophy, world religions, and French and [[German literature]]. Together they studied innumerable authors, philosophers, theological and religious subjects, and all of this wide-ranging study laid the groundwork for her intellectual encounters with very well-known thinkers of her time. Gillot became so smitten with Salom\u00e9 that he wanted to divorce his wife and marry his young student. Salom\u00e9 refused, for she was not interested in marriage and sexual relations.  Though disappointed and shocked by this development, she remained friends with Gillot.\n\nFollowing her father's death in 1879, Salom\u00e9 and her mother went to [[Zurich]], so Salom\u00e9 could acquire a university education as a \"guest student\". In her one year at the [[University of Zurich]]--one of the few schools that accepted female students--Salom\u00e9 attended lectures in philosophy (logic, history of philosophy, ancient philosophy, and psychology) and theology (dogmatics). During this time, Salom\u00e9's physical health was failing due to a lung disease, causing her to cough up blood. Due to this, she was instructed to heal in warmer climates, so in February 1882, Salom\u00e9 and her mother went to Rome.\n\n[[File:Nietzsche paul-ree lou-von-salome188.jpg|thumb|Left to right, Andreas-Salom\u00e9, R\u00e9e and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] (1882)]]\n\n===R\u00e9e and Nietzsche, and later life===\nSalom\u00e9's mother took her to Rome when Salom\u00e9 was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salom\u00e9 became acquainted with the author [[Paul R\u00e9e]]. R\u00e9e proposed to her, but she instead suggested that they live and study together as 'brother and sister' along with another man for company, and thereby establish an academic commune.<ref name=\"Nietzsche 1999 page 149\">''Nietzsche: The Man and his Philosophy'', by R.J. Hollingdale (Cambridge University Press 1999), page 149</ref> R\u00e9e accepted the idea, and suggested that they be joined by his friend [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salom\u00e9, as R\u00e9e had earlier done.  Nietzsche asked R\u00e9e to propose marriage to Salom\u00e9 on his behalf, which she rejected. She had been interested in Nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband.<ref name=\"Nietzsche 1999 page 149\"/> Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join R\u00e9e and Salom\u00e9 touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune. On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salom\u00e9, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, and she again rejected him. He was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune.<ref name=\"Nietzsche 1999 page 149\"/> After discovering the situation, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth became determined to get Nietzsche away from what she described as the \"immoral woman\".<ref>''Nietzsche: The Man and his Philosophy'', by R.J. Hollingdale (Cambridge University Press 1999), page 151</ref> The three traveled with Salom\u00e9's mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their \"Winterplan\" commune.  This commune was intended to be set up in an abandoned monastery, but as no suitable location was found, the plan was abandoned.\n\nAfter arriving in [[Leipzig]] in October 1882, the three spent a number of weeks together. However, the following month R\u00e9e and Salom\u00e9 parted company with Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to R\u00e9e, asking him, \"We shall see one another from time to time, won't we?\"<ref name=\"Nietzsche 1999 page 152\">''Nietzsche: The Man and his Philosophy'', by R.J.

I could have said literally what you told me when you confessed your love to me: Only you are real. That is how we became husband and wife even before we became friends, not by choice, but by this unfathomable marriage [...] We were brother and sister, but as in a distant past, before the marriage between brother and sister became sacrilegious\".<ref>Philippe Jaccottet, ''Rilke par lui-m\u00eame,'' 1970, p.29\u201330</ref>\n\nIn 1899 with her husband Friedrich-Carl, then again in 1900, Lou traveled to Russia, the second time with Rilke, whose first name she changed from Ren\u00e9 to Rainer.<ref>Gerald Stieg, 2007, p.979-980</ref> She taught him Russian, to read [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] (whom he would later meet) and [[Aleksandr Pushkin|Pushkin]].

In 1937, [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] said of Salom\u00e9's relationship with Rilke: \"she was both the muse and the attentive mother of the great poet\".<ref>Roudinesco and Plon, 2011, <abbr>p.</abbr> 65</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:G\u00f6ttingen Stadtfriedhof Grab Andreas-Salome.jpg|thumb|Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9's grave in G\u00f6ttingen]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\n\nAt the age of 74, Salom\u00e9 ceased to work as a psychoanalyst.

A few days before her death the Gestapo confiscated her library (according to other sources it was an SA group who destroyed the library shortly after her death).

Salom\u00e9's literary and analytical studies became such a vogue in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], where she lived late in her life, that the [[Gestapo]] waited until shortly after her death to \"clean\" her library of works by Jews.\n\nShe was one of the first female psychoanalysts and one of the first women to write psychoanalytically on female sexuality,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/12/lou-andreas-salome-sigmund-freud-letters/|title=Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9, the First Woman Psychoanalyst, on Human Nature in Letters to Freud|last=Popova|first=Maria|date=12 February 2015|work=Brain Pickings|access-date=17 July 2017}}</ref> before [[Helene Deutsch]], for instance in her essay on the anal-erotic (1916), an essay admired by Freud. However, she had written about the psychology of female sexuality before she ever met Freud, in her book ''Die Erotik'' (1911).\n\nShe wrote more than a dozen novels, including ''Im Kampf um Gott'', ''Ruth'', ''Rodinka'', ''Ma'', ''Fenitschka \u2013 eine Ausschweifung'', as well as non-fiction studies such as ''Henrik Ibsens Frauengestalten'' (1892), a study of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s female characters, and a book on Nietzsche, ''Friedrich Nietzsche in seinen Werken'' (1894).\n\nSalom\u00e9 edited a memoir about Rilke after his death in 1926. Among her works is also her ''Lebensr\u00fcckblick'', which she wrote during her last years based on memories of her life as a free woman.

In 2013 they played during [[Canadian Music Week]] and Filter Music's Culture Collide Festival in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2013 the released their third production, a 10-song LP titled In the Hour of the Wolf which was promoted during their second visit to [[SXSW]] in 2014. After several shows during that year they announced a hiatus, which lasted till late 2017 when they suddenly returned to the stage, now with Monserrat Vargas back in their lineup.\n\n== Biography ==\nThe initial lineup was formed in 2009 when Paola Rogue (vox, guitar) and Andrea San Gil (drums) decided to carry on after the split of their previous act, Lolita Pi\u00f1ata. They were soon joined by Monserrat Vargas (bass), who had played with Paola in previous projects years back.\n\nAfter spending the first part of the year practicing and crafting songs, they started playing in several local venues such as El Cuartel, Latino Rock and El CENAC, amongst others.\n\nThe group was joined by Jimena Torres as a second guitar in 2010. With their lineup finally complete, they set on to record and release their first EP titled [http://thegreatwilderness.bandcamp.com/album/afterimages-of-glowing-visions Afterimages of Glowing Visions], a semi-conceptual work based on a post-apocalyptic dream that leads to the discovering of one's inner world.\n\nIn November 2010, they revealed their second EP, [http://thegreatwilderness.bandcamp.com/album/tiny-monsters Tiny Monsters], to the public. It is a 6-song album focused on topics such as claustrophobia, determinism and obsessiveness. After this release, the band has been featured in publications like The [[NME]] Magazine, Noiseloop and Cuchara Sonica, where it was chosen as the best new underground band of 2010.\n\nThe band released a double single on April 15. The song is called \u201c[http://thegreatwilderness.bandcamp.com/album/dark-horse-single Dark Horse]\u201d (parts 1 and 2) and it was also accompanied by a live video recorded by the production company S\u00fcrrealista at a show that took place in El Lobo Estepario. The single was available for download at their [[Bandcamp]] page.\n\nIn September 2011 they embarked on their first European tour, which took them to countries such as France, Germany and the UK. During this tour they played along bands like Ghxst (USA), [[Portugal. The Man]] (USA) and La Pegatina (Spain), among others.\n\nSoon alter returning to Costa Rica, they participated in the compilation [http://sisanjose.bandcamp.com/album/s-san-jos S\u00ed San Jos\u00e9], a project conceived by the North American producer Vito Petruzzelli (in collaboration with Daniel Ortu\u00f1o and Adrian Poveda) which featured 9 bands of the Costa Rican indie scene. The compilation received acclaim both nationally and internationally. After completing the recording process for this project, Andrea San Gil left the band and was replaced by Alexandro Baviera, known for his work with bands like A Cry for Marie and Alphabetics.\n\nIn December 2011, \"Dark Horse\" won the award for best song of 2011 given by renowned members of the Costa Rican press through the digital magazine [http://www.89decibeles.com/ 89decibeles]. On that same month, they received an invitation to participate in North American festival [[SXSW]], which took place during the month of March 2012. They showcased with bands like [[Cymbals Eat Guitars]], [[A Classic Education]] and [[Ganglians]].\n\nTheir return home saw them play at the Imperial Festival along artists like [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Cage the Elephant]], [[Manchester Orchestra]] and [[TV on the Radio]] among many others. The reviews of their performance were positive and the band started to gain a bigger following in Costa Rica. Sadly, they had to face the loss of founder and bassist, Monserrat Vargas, who decided to quit the band due to personal conflicts and her desire to focus on her other project, Las Robertas.\n\nThe band quickly got back on their feet with substitute bassist, Gustavo Quiros, who helped them get through previous commitments and the recording of their first LP, In the Hour of the Wolf. This album was created with the help of Ronald Bustamante, Daniel Ortu\u00f1o and Giancarlo Tassara of Mi\u00fct Audio, San Jose. The tracks revolve around the theme of loss and recovery with a much heavier sound and an inclination towards bass and drum dynamics.\n\nWith the album was still in process, they travelled to Toronto to play during [[Canadian Music Week]] 2013, where they shared the stage with groups like [[Revolvers]], [[Funeral Suits]] and [[A Place to Bury Strangers]], [[Austra]] and an event organised by [[Filter Magazine]] as part of their [[Culture Collide]] initiative, to which they were invited in 2013 to play in several showcases.\n\nIn late 2013 they released [[In the Hour of the Wolf]], their first LP; which was promoted during their second visit to [[SXSW]]. After that last show, they announced a hiatus which lasted until late 2017 when they suddenly returned to the stages with new music in hand.\n\n==Influences==\nThey have been inspired by British pop and US alternative rock  bands like [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. Female singers that influenced them are [[Shirley Manson]], [[Brody Dalle]], [[Courtney Love]], [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], [[Kim Gordon]] and [[Siouxsie]] from [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicinpress.com/artists/item/17-the-great-wilderness|title=A Band Defying Conventions About Gender, Music and Tradition: The Great Wilderness|work=Music In Press|first=Bojana|last=Sandic|date=17 November 2015|accessdate=15 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109114508/http://musicinpress.com/artists/item/17-the-great-wilderness|archivedate=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n* ''Afterimages of Glowing Visions'' (Jun 2010)\n* ''Tiny Monsters'' (Nov 2010)\n* ''Dark Horse (Single)'' (Apr 2011)\n* ''In the Hour of the Wolf'' (Nov 2013)\n\n== Videography ==\n* ''[http://vimeo.com/15236055 On Smoke]'' (September 2010, Cazadora Producciones)\n* ''[http://vimeo.com/15447004 Nicolas Cage & Kiddy Plane]'' (September 2010, Cazadora Producciones)\n* ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bjbOoeCgcs&feature=player_embedded Dark Horse]'' (March 2011, S\u00fcrrealista)\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://thegreatwilderness.net/ Official website]\n*[http://facebook.com/tgwband FB]\n*[http://www.myspace.com/thegreatwilderness Myspace]\n*[http://thegreatwilderness.bandcamp.com Bandcamp]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Great Wilderness}}\n[[Category:Costa Rican rock music groups]]\n[[Category:Costa Rican indie rock groups]]\n[[Category:Post-punk revival music groups]]\n[[Category:Shoegazing musical groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 2009]]\n[[Category:2009 establishments in Costa Rica]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = The Great Wilderness\n| image               = \n| caption             = \n| origin              = San Jose, Costa Rica\n| background          = group_or_band\n| genre               = [[Post punk]], [[shoegaze]], [[dream pop]]\n| years_active        = 2009\u2013present\n| associated_acts     = Lolita Pi\u00f1ata, Las Robertas, Alphabetics\n| label               = \n| website             = [http://thegreatwilderness.net/ Official website]<br />[http://thegreatwilderness.bandcamp.com Bandcamp] \n| current_members     = Paola Rogue<br />Jimena Torres<br />Monserrat Vargas \n| past_members        = Andrea San Gil<br />Marco G\u00f6lcher<br />Alexandro Baviera<br />Diego Trika\n}}\n\n'''The Great Wilderness''' (TGW) is a dream rock band from Costa Rica, influenced by British post punk and alternative rock.\n\nThe group has toured Europe visiting cities like Berlin (playing at Lido), London (The Old Blue Last, The Dublin Castle), Manchester (Night & Day Cafe) and Paris (Le Motel).

[[Bantu expansion]] is estimated to have reached the Middle Congo by about 500 BC, and the Upper Congo by the first century AD. Remnants of the aboriginal population displaced by the Bantu migration, [[Pygmies]]/''[[Abatwa]]'' of the [[Ubangian languages|Ubangian]] phylum, remain in the remote forest areas of the Congo basin.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Kongo]] was formed around 1400 on the left banks of the lower Congo River. Its territorial control along the river remained limited to what corresponds to the modern [[Bas-Congo]] province.  European exploration of the Congo begins in  1482, when Portuguese explorer [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] discovered the river estuary<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Congo|volume=6|page=917|first=Frank Richardson |last=Cana}}</ref> (likely in August 1482), which he marked by a [[Padr\u00e3o]], or stone pillar (still existing, but only in fragments) erected on Shark Point. C\u00e3o also sailed up the river for a short distance, establishing contact with the Kingdom of Congo. The full course of the river remained unknown throughout the early modern period.<ref>The [[Dieppe maps]] of the mid-16th century show the Congo only as a minor river, while having the [[Nile]] run throughout the continent, rising in Southern Africa. The same interpretation is in essence still found in Jan Blaeu's ''[[:File:Congo map 1690.jpg|Atlas Maior]]'' of 1660. Jacques Bellin's [[:File:Congo map 1754.jpg|map of the Congo]] in ''Histoire Generale Des Voyages'' by [[Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost]] (1754) shows awareness of the river reaching further inland, to the provinces of ''Sundi'' and ''Pango'', but has no detailed knowledge of its course.</ref>\n\nThe upper Congo basin runs west of the [[Albertine Rift]].<ref name=EB1911/> Its connection to the Congo was unknown until 1877.\nThe extreme northeast of the Congo basin was reached by the [[Nilotic expansion]] at some point between the 15th and 18th centuries, by the ancestors of the [[Southern Luo]] speaking  [[Alur people]].\n[[Francisco de Lacerda]] following the [[Zambezi]] reached the uppermost part of the Congo basin (the [[Kazembe]] in the upper [[Luapula River|Luapula]] basin) in 1796.\n\nThe upper Congo River, known as the [[Lualaba River|Lualaba]] was first reached by the [[Arab slave trade]] by the 19th century.

Jephson]]]]\n\nThe middle reaches of the Congo remained unexplored from either the east or west, until [[Henry Morton Stanley]]'s expedition of 1876\u201377.\nAt the time one of the last open questions of the [[exploration of Africa]] (or indeed of the [[Age of exploration|world]])\nwhether the Lualaba River fed the [[Nile]] (Livingstone's theory), the Congo<ref>Jeal, 2007 pp. 188\u2013219.</ref> or even the [[Niger River|Niger]].\nFinanced in 1874, [[Henry Morton Stanley's first trans-Africa exploration|Stanley's first trans-Africa exploration]]\nstarted in [[Zanzibar]], and reached the Lualaba on October 17, 1876.\nOverland he reached [[Nyangwe]], the centre of a lawless area containing cannibal tribes at which [[Tippu Tip]] based his trade in slaves. Stanley managed to hire a force from Tippu Tip, to guard him for the next {{convert|150|km|mi|sigfig=1}} or so, for 90 days. The party left Nyangwe overland through the dense Matimba forest. On November 19 they reached the Lualaba again. Since the going through the forest was so heavy, Tippu Tip turned around with his party on December 28, leaving Stanley on his own, with 143 people, including 8 children and 16 women. They had 23 canoes. His first encounter with a local tribe was with the cannibal Wenya. In total Stanley would report 32 unfriendly meetings on the river, some violent, even though he attempted to negotiate a peaceful thoroughfare. But the tribes were wary as their only experience of outsiders was of slave traders.\n\nOn January 6, 1877, after {{convert|400|mi|km|order=flip}}, they reached [[Boyoma Falls]] (called Stanley Falls for some time after), consisting of seven cataracts spanning {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} which they had to bypass overland. It took them to February 7 to reach the end of the falls. Here Stanley learned that the river was called ''Ikuta Yacongo'',<ref>Jeal, 2007 p. 199; February 7, 1877</ref> proving to him that he had reached the Congo, and that the Lualaba did not feed the Nile.\n\nFrom this point, the tribes were no longer cannibals, but possessed firearms, apparently as a result of Portuguese influence. Some four weeks and {{convert|1200|mi|km|order=flip}} later he reached Stanley Pool (now [[Pool Malebo]]), the site of the present day cities [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]]. Further downstream were the [[Livingstone Falls]], misnamed as Livingstone had never been on the Congo: a series of 32 falls and rapids with a fall of {{convert|900|ft|m|order=flip}} over {{convert|220|mi|km|order=flip}}.\nOn 15 March they started the descent of the falls, which took five months and cost numerous lives. From the Isangile Falls, five falls from the foot, they beached the canoes and ''Lady Alice'' and left the river, aiming for the Portuguese outpost of [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]] via land. On August 3 they reached the hamlet Nsada. From there Stanley sent four men with letters forward to Boma, asking for food for his starving people. On August 7 relief came, being sent by representatives from the [[Liverpool]] trading firm Hatton & Cookson. On August 9 they reached Boma, 1,001 days since leaving Zanzibar on November 12, 1874. The party then consisted of 108 people, including three children born during the trip. Most probably (Stanley's own publications give inconsistent figures), he lost 132 people through disease, hunger, drowning, killing and desertion.<ref>Jeal, 2007 p. 217. {{cite book | title=Through the Dark Continent| last=Stanley| first=Henry M.| year=1988| pages=432 pages| publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-25667-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Kinshasa]] was founded as a trading post by [[Henry Morton Stanley|Stanley]] in 1881 and named [[L\u00e9opoldville]] in honour of [[Leopold II of Belgium]].

[[Bantu expansion]] is estimated to have reached the Middle Congo by about 500 BC, and the Upper Congo by the first century AD. Remnants of the aboriginal population displaced by the Bantu migration, [[Pygmies]]/''[[Abatwa]]'' of the [[Ubangian languages|Ubangian]] phylum, remain in the remote forest areas of the Congo basin.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Kongo]] was formed around 1400 on the left banks of the lower Congo River. Its territorial control along the river remained limited to what corresponds to the modern [[Bas-Congo]] province.  European exploration of the Congo begins in  1482, when Portuguese explorer [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] discovered the river estuary<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Congo|volume=6|page=917|first=Frank Richardson |last=Cana}}</ref> (likely in August 1482), which he marked by a [[Padr\u00e3o]], or stone pillar (still existing, but only in fragments) erected on Shark Point. C\u00e3o also sailed up the river for a short distance, establishing contact with the Kingdom of Congo. The full course of the river remained unknown throughout the early modern period.<ref>The [[Dieppe maps]] of the mid-16th century show the Congo only as a minor river, while having the [[Nile]] run throughout the continent, rising in Southern Africa. The same interpretation is in essence still found in Jan Blaeu's ''[[:File:Congo map 1690.jpg|Atlas Maior]]'' of 1660. Jacques Bellin's [[:File:Congo map 1754.jpg|map of the Congo]] in ''Histoire Generale Des Voyages'' by [[Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost]] (1754) shows awareness of the river reaching further inland, to the provinces of ''Sundi'' and ''Pango'', but has no detailed knowledge of its course.</ref>\n\nThe upper Congo basin runs west of the [[Albertine Rift]].<ref name=EB1911/> Its connection to the Congo was unknown until 1877.\nThe extreme northeast of the Congo basin was reached by the [[Nilotic expansion]] at some point between the 15th and 18th centuries, by the ancestors of the [[Southern Luo]] speaking  [[Alur people]].\n[[Francisco de Lacerda]] following the [[Zambezi]] reached the uppermost part of the Congo basin (the [[Kazembe]] in the upper [[Luapula River|Luapula]] basin) in 1796.\n\nThe upper Congo River, known as the [[Lualaba River|Lualaba]] was first reached by the [[Arab slave trade]] by the 19th century.

Jephson]]]]\n\nThe middle reaches of the Congo remained unexplored from either the east or west, until [[Henry Morton Stanley]]'s expedition of 1876\u201377.\nAt the time one of the last open questions of the [[exploration of Africa]] (or indeed of the [[Age of exploration|world]])\nwhether the Lualaba River fed the [[Nile]] (Livingstone's theory), the Congo<ref>Jeal, 2007 pp. 188\u2013219.</ref> or even the [[Niger River|Niger]].\nFinanced in 1874, [[Henry Morton Stanley's first trans-Africa exploration|Stanley's first trans-Africa exploration]]\nstarted in [[Zanzibar]], and reached the Lualaba on October 17, 1876.\nOverland he reached [[Nyangwe]], the centre of a lawless area containing cannibal tribes at which [[Tippu Tip]] based his trade in slaves. Stanley managed to hire a force from Tippu Tip, to guard him for the next {{convert|150|km|mi|sigfig=1}} or so, for 90 days. The party left Nyangwe overland through the dense Matimba forest. On November 19 they reached the Lualaba again. Since the going through the forest was so heavy, Tippu Tip turned around with his party on December 28, leaving Stanley on his own, with 143 people, including 8 children and 16 women. They had 23 canoes. His first encounter with a local tribe was with the cannibal Wenya. In total Stanley would report 32 unfriendly meetings on the river, some violent, even though he attempted to negotiate a peaceful thoroughfare. But the tribes were wary as their only experience of outsiders was of slave traders.\n\nOn January 6, 1877, after {{convert|400|mi|km|order=flip}}, they reached [[Boyoma Falls]] (called Stanley Falls for some time after), consisting of seven cataracts spanning {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} which they had to bypass overland. It took them to February 7 to reach the end of the falls. Here Stanley learned that the river was called ''Ikuta Yacongo'',<ref>Jeal, 2007 p. 199; February 7, 1877</ref> proving to him that he had reached the Congo, and that the Lualaba did not feed the Nile.\n\nFrom this point, the tribes were no longer cannibals, but possessed firearms, apparently as a result of Portuguese influence. Some four weeks and {{convert|1200|mi|km|order=flip}} later he reached Stanley Pool (now [[Pool Malebo]]), the site of the present day cities [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]]. Further downstream were the [[Livingstone Falls]], misnamed as Livingstone had never been on the Congo: a series of 32 falls and rapids with a fall of {{convert|900|ft|m|order=flip}} over {{convert|220|mi|km|order=flip}}.\nOn 15 March they started the descent of the falls, which took five months and cost numerous lives. From the Isangile Falls, five falls from the foot, they beached the canoes and ''Lady Alice'' and left the river, aiming for the Portuguese outpost of [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]] via land. On August 3 they reached the hamlet Nsada. From there Stanley sent four men with letters forward to Boma, asking for food for his starving people. On August 7 relief came, being sent by representatives from the [[Liverpool]] trading firm Hatton & Cookson. On August 9 they reached Boma, 1,001 days since leaving Zanzibar on November 12, 1874. The party then consisted of 108 people, including three children born during the trip. Most probably (Stanley's own publications give inconsistent figures), he lost 132 people through disease, hunger, drowning, killing and desertion.<ref>Jeal, 2007 p. 217. {{cite book | title=Through the Dark Continent| last=Stanley| first=Henry M.| year=1988| pages=432 pages| publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-25667-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Kinshasa]] was founded as a trading post by [[Henry Morton Stanley|Stanley]] in 1881 and named [[L\u00e9opoldville]] in honour of [[Leopold II of Belgium]].

It was organized in 1847, and named after a chief of the [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] tribe.\n\nIn 1980, Winneshiek County reported a population of 21,842. Like much of Iowa during the 1980s it witnessed a population loss, dropping to 20,847 according to the 1990 United States Census. However, during the 1990s the county experienced some mild growth and was able to rise above the 21,000 mark once again.\n\n==Government and elected officials==\nAs of 2010, the Winneshiek County government had a total of 785 employees and staff.\n\n==Politics==\nLike all Iowa counties, Winneshiek is governed by an elected [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] [[Board of Supervisors]]. Winneshiek County's Board of Supervisors has five members elected by single-member districts of equal population. Other elected officials are the [[district attorney|county attorney]], [[auditor]], [[sheriff]] and [[treasurer]].

It was organized in 1847, and named after a chief of the [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] tribe.\n\nIn 1980, Winneshiek County reported a population of 21,842. Like much of Iowa during the 1980s it witnessed a population loss, dropping to 20,847 according to the 1990 United States Census. However, during the 1990s the county experienced some mild growth and was able to rise above the 21,000 mark once again.\n\n==Government and elected officials==\nAs of 2010, the Winneshiek County government had a total of 785 employees and staff.\n\n==Politics==\nLike all Iowa counties, Winneshiek is governed by an elected [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] [[Board of Supervisors]]. Winneshiek County's Board of Supervisors has five members elected by single-member districts of equal population. Other elected officials are the [[district attorney|county attorney]], [[auditor]], [[sheriff]] and [[treasurer]]. The offices for the supervisors and county officers are located in the County Courthouse at the county seat.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential Elections Results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

But the U.S. victory in the [[Space Race]] \u2014 landing men on the Moon \u2014 erased the perceived threat, and NASA was unable to sustain political support for its vision of an even more ambitious [[Space Transportation System]] entailing [[Space Shuttle|reusable Earth-to-orbit shuttle]]s, a permanent [[space station]], [[lunar base]]s, and a [[manned mission to Mars]]. Only a scaled-back space shuttle was approved, and NASA's funding leveled off at just under 1% in 1976, then declined to 0.75% in 1986. After a brief increase to 1.01% in 1992, it declined to about 0.5% in 2013.\n\nTo help with public perception and to raise awareness regarding the widespread benefits of NASA-funded programs and technologies, NASA instituted the [[NASA spinoff technologies|Spinoffs]] publication. This was a direct offshoot of the Technology Utilization Program Report, a \"publication dedicated to informing the scientific community about available NASA technologies, and ongoing requests received for supporting information.\" according to the NASA Spinoff about page the technologies in these reports created interest in the technology transfer concept, its successes, and its use as a public awareness tool. The reports generated such keen interest by the public that NASA decided to make them into an attractive publication. Thus, the first four-color edition of Spinoff was published in 1976.<ref name=\"NASA Spinoff About\">{{cite web|url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinhist.html|title=About Spinoff|date=n.d.|publisher=NASA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208072735/http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinhist.html|archivedate=2014-12-08|url-status=dead|accessdate=26 Nov 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe American public, on average, believes NASA's budget has a much larger share of the federal budget than it actually does.

But the U.S. victory in the [[Space Race]] \u2014 landing men on the Moon \u2014 erased the perceived threat, and NASA was unable to sustain political support for its vision of an even more ambitious [[Space Transportation System]] entailing [[Space Shuttle|reusable Earth-to-orbit shuttle]]s, a permanent [[space station]], [[lunar base]]s, and a [[manned mission to Mars]]. Only a scaled-back space shuttle was approved, and NASA's funding leveled off at just under 1% in 1976, then declined to 0.75% in 1986. After a brief increase to 1.01% in 1992, it declined to about 0.5% in 2013.\n\nTo help with public perception and to raise awareness regarding the widespread benefits of NASA-funded programs and technologies, NASA instituted the [[NASA spinoff technologies|Spinoffs]] publication. This was a direct offshoot of the Technology Utilization Program Report, a \"publication dedicated to informing the scientific community about available NASA technologies, and ongoing requests received for supporting information.\" according to the NASA Spinoff about page the technologies in these reports created interest in the technology transfer concept, its successes, and its use as a public awareness tool. The reports generated such keen interest by the public that NASA decided to make them into an attractive publication. Thus, the first four-color edition of Spinoff was published in 1976.<ref name=\"NASA Spinoff About\">{{cite web|url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinhist.html|title=About Spinoff|date=n.d.|publisher=NASA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208072735/http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinhist.html|archivedate=2014-12-08|url-status=dead|accessdate=26 Nov 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe American public, on average, believes NASA's budget has a much larger share of the federal budget than it actually does.

The appearance of the [[Kebarian]] culture, of [[microlith]]ic type implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic.  The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog.<ref>Dayan, Tamar (1994), \"Early Domesticated Dogs of the Near East\" (Journal of Archaeological Science Volume 21, Issue 5, September 1994, Pages 633\u2013640)</ref> Extending from 18\u201310,500&nbsp;BC, the [[Kebaran culture]]<ref>Ronen, Avram, \"Climate, sea level, and culture in the Eastern Mediterranean 20 ky to the present\" in Valentina Yanko-Hombach, Allan S. Gilbert, Nicolae Panin and Pavel M. Dolukhanov (2007), ''The Black Sea Flood Question: Changes in Coastline, Climate, and Human Settlement'' (Springer)</ref> shows clear connections to the earlier [[Microlithic]] cultures using the bow and arrow, and using grinding stones to harvest wild grains, that developed from the {{circa|24,000|17,000&nbsp;BC}} [[Halfan culture]] of [[Egypt]], that came from the still earlier [[Aterian]] tradition of the Sahara. Some linguists see this as the earliest arrival of [[Nostratic languages]] in the Middle East.\nKebaran culture was quite successful, and was ancestral to the later [[Natufian culture]] (12,500\u20139,500&nbsp;BC), which extended throughout the whole of the Levantine region. These people pioneered the first sedentary settlements, and may have supported themselves from fishing and the harvest of wild grains plentiful in the region at that time. {{As of|2018|7|post=,}} the oldest remains of bread were discovered {{circa|12,400&nbsp;BC}} at the archaeological site [[Shubayqa 1]], once home of the Natufian hunter-gatherers, roughly 4,000 years before the advent of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mejia|first=Paula|date=16 July 2018|title=Found: 14,400-Year-Old Flatbread Remains That Predate Agriculture|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|url-status=live|department=Gastro Obscura|work=[[Atlas Obscura]]|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717191316/https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|archive-date=17 July 2017|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNatufian culture also demonstrates the earliest domestication of the [[dog]], and the assistance of this animal in hunting and guarding human settlements may have contributed to the successful spread of this culture. In the northern Syrian, eastern Anatolian region of the Levant, Natufian culture at [[Cayonu]] and [[Mureybet]] developed the first fully agricultural culture with the addition of wild grains, later being supplemented with domesticated sheep and goats, which were probably domesticated first by the [[Zarzian culture]] of Northern Iraq and Iran (which like the Natufian culture may have also developed from Kebaran).\n\nBy 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ([[PPNA]]) culture developed out of the earlier local tradition of Natufian in Southern Palestine, dwelling in round houses, and building the first defensive site at [[Tell es-Sultan]] (ancient Jericho) (guarding a valuable fresh water spring). This was replaced in 7500&nbsp;BC by Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ([[PPNB]]), dwelling in square houses, coming from Northern Syria and the Euphrates bend.\n\nDuring the period of 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, another hunter-gatherer group, showing clear affinities with the cultures of Egypt (particularly the Outacha retouch technique for working stone) was in Sinai. This [[Harifian]] culture<ref>Belfer-Cohen, Anna and Bar-Yosef, Ofer \"Early Sedentism in the Near East: A Bumpy Ride to Village Life\" (''Fundamental Issues in Archaeology'', 2002, Part II, 19\u201338)</ref> may have adopted the use of pottery from the [[Isnan culture]] and [[Helwan culture]] of Egypt (which lasted from 9000 to 4500&nbsp;BC), and subsequently fused with elements from the PPNB culture during the climatic crisis of 6000&nbsp;BC to form what [[Juris Zarins]] calls the Syro-Arabian pastoral technocomplex,<ref>Zarins, Yuris \"Early Pastoral Nomadiism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia\" (# ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' No. 280, November, 1990)</ref> which saw the spread of the first [[Nomadic pastoralists]] in the Ancient Near East. These extended southwards along the [[Red Sea]] coast and penetrating the Arabian bifacial cultures, which became progressively more Neolithic and pastoral, and extending north and eastwards, to lay the foundations for the tent-dwelling [[Amorite|Martu]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] peoples of [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nIn the [[Amuq valley]] of Syria, [[PPNB culture]] seems to have survived, influencing further cultural developments further south. Nomadic elements fused with PPNB to form the [[Minhata Culture]] and [[Yarmukian Culture]] which were to spread southwards, beginning the development of the classic mixed farming Mediterranean culture, and from 5600&nbsp;BC were associated with the [[Ghassulian culture]] of the region, the first [[chalcolithic]] culture of the Levant. This period also witnessed the development of megalithic structures, which continued into the Bronze Age.<ref>Scheltema, H.G. (2008). ''Megalithic Jordan: An Introduction and Field Guide''.

The old Syrian period was dominated by the [[Ebla#First kingdom|Eblaite first kingdom]] (3000 BC - 2300 BC), [[Tell Brak#Kingdom of Nagar|Kingdom of Nagar]] (2600 BC - 2300 BC) and the [[Mari, Syria#The second kingdom|Mariote second kingdom]] (2500 BC - 2290 BC). The [[Akkadian Empire]] conquered large areas of the Levant and were followed by the [[Amorites|Amorite kingdoms]], ca. 2000\u20131600&nbsp;BC, which arose in [[Mari, Syria#The Lim dynasty|Mari]], [[Yamkhad]] and [[Qatna]]. The Amorites also founded [[Babylon]] in Mesopotamia. Also following the Akkadians was the extension of Khirbet Kerak ware culture, showing affinities with the [[Caucasus]], and possibly linked to the later appearance of the [[Hurrians]].\n\nAround the 17th and 16th centuries&nbsp;BC most of the older centers had been overrun. The [[Mitanni]], for a time, menaced the Hittite kingdom, but were defeated by it around the middle of the 14th. The Semitic [[Hyksos]] used the new technologies to occupy Egypt, but were expelled, leaving the empire of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] to develop in their wake. From 1550 until 1100, much of the Levant was conquered by Egypt, which in the latter half of this period contested Syria with the Hittite Empire.\n\nAt the end of the 13th century&nbsp;BC, all of these powers suddenly collapsed. Cities all around the eastern Mediterranean were sacked within a span of a few decades by assorted raiders. The Hittite empire was destroyed. Egypt repelled its attackers with only a major effort, and over the next century shrank to its territorial core, its central authority permanently weakened. Multiple cities on the Coast like [[Ugarit]] and other Canaanite cities were destroyed by the Sea People.\n\n==Iron Age==\nThe [[Bronze Age collapse|destruction at the end of the Bronze Age]] left a number of tiny kingdoms and city-states behind. A few [[Hittites|Hittite]] centres remained in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] known as the [[Syro-Hittite states]], along with some [[Phoenicia]]n ports in [[Canaan]] that escaped destruction and developed into great commercial powers. The [[Israelites]] emerged as a rural culture (possibly from the displaced Canaanite refugees escaping the Bronze Age Collapse to [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]] alongside groups like the [[Shasu]] and the [[Habiru]]) mainly in the Canaanite hill-country and the Eastern Galilee, quickly spreading through the land and forming an alliance in the struggle for the land against the Philistines to the West, [[Moab]] and [[Ammon]] to the East and [[Edom]] to the South. In the 12th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC, most of the interior, as well as [[Babylonia]], was overrun by [[Aramaeans|Arameans]], while the shoreline around today's [[Gaza Strip]] was settled by [[Philistines]]. At this time the Chaldeans (in different waves of people) had left the Levant for Mesopotamia and established the [[Neo-Babylonian empire]] from which [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] came from. \n\nIn this period a number of technological innovations spread, most notably iron working and the [[Phoenician alphabet]], developed by the Phoenicians or the Canaanites around the 16th century&nbsp;BC.\n\nDuring the 9th century&nbsp;BC, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] began to reassert themselves against the incursions of the Aramaeans, and over the next few centuries developed into a powerful and well-organised empire. Their armies were among the first to employ cavalry, which took the place of chariots, and had a reputation for both prowess and brutality. At their height, the Assyrians dominated all of the Levant, Egypt, and Babylonia. However, the empire began to collapse toward the end of the 7th century&nbsp;BC, and was obliterated by an alliance between a resurgent [[New Kingdom of Babylonia]] and the Iranian [[Medes]].\n\nThe subsequent balance of power was short-lived, though. In the 550s&nbsp;BC the [[Persian people|Persians]] revolted against the Medes and gained control of their empire, and over the next few decades annexed to it the realms of [[Lydia]] in [[Anatolia]], [[Damascus]], [[Babylonia]], and [[Egypt]], as well as consolidating their control over the Iranian plateau nearly as far as [[India]]. This vast kingdom was divided up into various [[satrap]]ies and governed roughly according to the Assyrian model, but with a far lighter hand. Around this time [[Zoroastrianism]] became the predominant religion in [[Iran|Persia]].\n\n==Classical Age==\n[[Iran|Persia]] controlled the Levant, but by the 4th century&nbsp;BC Persia had fallen into decline. The Phoenicians on the coast started many unsuccessful rebellions against the Persians who taxed them a lot, while the Jews were more relaxed under the Persian rule especially after the return from the exile that Cyrus the Great granted them. [[Ten Thousand|The campaigns]] of [[Xenophon]] in 401-399 BC illustrated how very vulnerable Persia had become to armies organized along [[ancient Greece|Greek]] lines. Such an army under the Macedonian King [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the Levant (333-332 BC).\n\nAlexander did not live long enough to consolidate his realm; after his death in 323 BC the greater share of the east eventually went to [[Seleucid Empire|the descendants]] of [[Seleucus I Nicator]]. This period saw great innovations in mathematics, science, architecture, and the like, and Greeks founded cities throughout the east, some of which grew to be the world's first major metropolises.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} [[Hellenistic culture]] did not, however, reach very far into the countryside. The Seleucids brought lots of Greeks, in addition to the descendants of the soldiers who served in the army of Alexander, from Greek cities to populate new cities founded all over the Levant.\n\nThe [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucids]] (312 to 63 BC) adopted a pro-western stance that alienated both the powerful eastern satraps and many Greeks who had migrated to the east. During the 2nd century&nbsp;BC, Greek culture lost ground in the Levant, and the Seleucid Empire began to break apart. The Seleucid decline continued, and the [[Roman Republic]] overran the Seleucid heartland in 65&nbsp;BC. Judea, which [[Maccabean Revolt|had become independent]] under the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] (140 BC - 37 BC), was annexed by Rome in 63&nbsp;BC and became [[Iudaea Province]] (6 - 135 AD). Approximately 5 Roman legions were placed in the Levant proper for a couple of centuries until they eventually fade from historical records in the start of the 5th century. \n\nA Persian dynasty, the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] (224-651), periodically clashed with [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and later with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 391 the Byzantine era began with the permanent division of the Roman Empire into Eastern and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves. Byzantine control over many parts of the Levant lasted until 636, when [[Arabs|Arab]] armies [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered the area]] and it became a part of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]].\n\nThe [[Byzantium|Byzantines]] reached a low point under [[Phocas]] ([[Byzantine Emperor]] from 602 to 610), with the Sassanids occupying the whole of the eastern Mediterranean. In 610, though, [[Heraclius]] took the throne in [[Constantinople]] and began a successful counter-attack, expelling the [[Persian people|Persians]] and invading [[Medes|Media]] and [[Assyria]].

The appearance of the [[Kebarian]] culture, of [[microlith]]ic type implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic.  The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog.<ref>Dayan, Tamar (1994), \"Early Domesticated Dogs of the Near East\" (Journal of Archaeological Science Volume 21, Issue 5, September 1994, Pages 633\u2013640)</ref> Extending from 18\u201310,500&nbsp;BC, the [[Kebaran culture]]<ref>Ronen, Avram, \"Climate, sea level, and culture in the Eastern Mediterranean 20 ky to the present\" in Valentina Yanko-Hombach, Allan S. Gilbert, Nicolae Panin and Pavel M. Dolukhanov (2007), ''The Black Sea Flood Question: Changes in Coastline, Climate, and Human Settlement'' (Springer)</ref> shows clear connections to the earlier [[Microlithic]] cultures using the bow and arrow, and using grinding stones to harvest wild grains, that developed from the {{circa|24,000|17,000&nbsp;BC}} [[Halfan culture]] of [[Egypt]], that came from the still earlier [[Aterian]] tradition of the Sahara. Some linguists see this as the earliest arrival of [[Nostratic languages]] in the Middle East.\nKebaran culture was quite successful, and was ancestral to the later [[Natufian culture]] (12,500\u20139,500&nbsp;BC), which extended throughout the whole of the Levantine region. These people pioneered the first sedentary settlements, and may have supported themselves from fishing and the harvest of wild grains plentiful in the region at that time. {{As of|2018|7|post=,}} the oldest remains of bread were discovered {{circa|12,400&nbsp;BC}} at the archaeological site [[Shubayqa 1]], once home of the Natufian hunter-gatherers, roughly 4,000 years before the advent of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mejia|first=Paula|date=16 July 2018|title=Found: 14,400-Year-Old Flatbread Remains That Predate Agriculture|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|url-status=live|department=Gastro Obscura|work=[[Atlas Obscura]]|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717191316/https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|archive-date=17 July 2017|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNatufian culture also demonstrates the earliest domestication of the [[dog]], and the assistance of this animal in hunting and guarding human settlements may have contributed to the successful spread of this culture. In the northern Syrian, eastern Anatolian region of the Levant, Natufian culture at [[Cayonu]] and [[Mureybet]] developed the first fully agricultural culture with the addition of wild grains, later being supplemented with domesticated sheep and goats, which were probably domesticated first by the [[Zarzian culture]] of Northern Iraq and Iran (which like the Natufian culture may have also developed from Kebaran).\n\nBy 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ([[PPNA]]) culture developed out of the earlier local tradition of Natufian in Southern Palestine, dwelling in round houses, and building the first defensive site at [[Tell es-Sultan]] (ancient Jericho) (guarding a valuable fresh water spring). This was replaced in 7500&nbsp;BC by Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ([[PPNB]]), dwelling in square houses, coming from Northern Syria and the Euphrates bend.\n\nDuring the period of 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, another hunter-gatherer group, showing clear affinities with the cultures of Egypt (particularly the Outacha retouch technique for working stone) was in Sinai. This [[Harifian]] culture<ref>Belfer-Cohen, Anna and Bar-Yosef, Ofer \"Early Sedentism in the Near East: A Bumpy Ride to Village Life\" (''Fundamental Issues in Archaeology'', 2002, Part II, 19\u201338)</ref> may have adopted the use of pottery from the [[Isnan culture]] and [[Helwan culture]] of Egypt (which lasted from 9000 to 4500&nbsp;BC), and subsequently fused with elements from the PPNB culture during the climatic crisis of 6000&nbsp;BC to form what [[Juris Zarins]] calls the Syro-Arabian pastoral technocomplex,<ref>Zarins, Yuris \"Early Pastoral Nomadiism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia\" (# ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' No. 280, November, 1990)</ref> which saw the spread of the first [[Nomadic pastoralists]] in the Ancient Near East. These extended southwards along the [[Red Sea]] coast and penetrating the Arabian bifacial cultures, which became progressively more Neolithic and pastoral, and extending north and eastwards, to lay the foundations for the tent-dwelling [[Amorite|Martu]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] peoples of [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nIn the [[Amuq valley]] of Syria, [[PPNB culture]] seems to have survived, influencing further cultural developments further south. Nomadic elements fused with PPNB to form the [[Minhata Culture]] and [[Yarmukian Culture]] which were to spread southwards, beginning the development of the classic mixed farming Mediterranean culture, and from 5600&nbsp;BC were associated with the [[Ghassulian culture]] of the region, the first [[chalcolithic]] culture of the Levant. This period also witnessed the development of megalithic structures, which continued into the Bronze Age.<ref>Scheltema, H.G. (2008). ''Megalithic Jordan: An Introduction and Field Guide''.

The old Syrian period was dominated by the [[Ebla#First kingdom|Eblaite first kingdom]] (3000 BC - 2300 BC), [[Tell Brak#Kingdom of Nagar|Kingdom of Nagar]] (2600 BC - 2300 BC) and the [[Mari, Syria#The second kingdom|Mariote second kingdom]] (2500 BC - 2290 BC). The [[Akkadian Empire]] conquered large areas of the Levant and were followed by the [[Amorites|Amorite kingdoms]], ca. 2000\u20131600&nbsp;BC, which arose in [[Mari, Syria#The Lim dynasty|Mari]], [[Yamkhad]] and [[Qatna]]. The Amorites also founded [[Babylon]] in Mesopotamia. Also following the Akkadians was the extension of Khirbet Kerak ware culture, showing affinities with the [[Caucasus]], and possibly linked to the later appearance of the [[Hurrians]].\n\nAround the 17th and 16th centuries&nbsp;BC most of the older centers had been overrun. The [[Mitanni]], for a time, menaced the Hittite kingdom, but were defeated by it around the middle of the 14th. The Semitic [[Hyksos]] used the new technologies to occupy Egypt, but were expelled, leaving the empire of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] to develop in their wake. From 1550 until 1100, much of the Levant was conquered by Egypt, which in the latter half of this period contested Syria with the Hittite Empire.\n\nAt the end of the 13th century&nbsp;BC, all of these powers suddenly collapsed. Cities all around the eastern Mediterranean were sacked within a span of a few decades by assorted raiders. The Hittite empire was destroyed. Egypt repelled its attackers with only a major effort, and over the next century shrank to its territorial core, its central authority permanently weakened. Multiple cities on the Coast like [[Ugarit]] and other Canaanite cities were destroyed by the Sea People.\n\n==Iron Age==\nThe [[Bronze Age collapse|destruction at the end of the Bronze Age]] left a number of tiny kingdoms and city-states behind. A few [[Hittites|Hittite]] centres remained in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] known as the [[Syro-Hittite states]], along with some [[Phoenicia]]n ports in [[Canaan]] that escaped destruction and developed into great commercial powers. The [[Israelites]] emerged as a rural culture (possibly from the displaced Canaanite refugees escaping the Bronze Age Collapse to [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]] alongside groups like the [[Shasu]] and the [[Habiru]]) mainly in the Canaanite hill-country and the Eastern Galilee, quickly spreading through the land and forming an alliance in the struggle for the land against the Philistines to the West, [[Moab]] and [[Ammon]] to the East and [[Edom]] to the South. In the 12th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC, most of the interior, as well as [[Babylonia]], was overrun by [[Aramaeans|Arameans]], while the shoreline around today's [[Gaza Strip]] was settled by [[Philistines]]. At this time the Chaldeans (in different waves of people) had left the Levant for Mesopotamia and established the [[Neo-Babylonian empire]] from which [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] came from. \n\nIn this period a number of technological innovations spread, most notably iron working and the [[Phoenician alphabet]], developed by the Phoenicians or the Canaanites around the 16th century&nbsp;BC.\n\nDuring the 9th century&nbsp;BC, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] began to reassert themselves against the incursions of the Aramaeans, and over the next few centuries developed into a powerful and well-organised empire. Their armies were among the first to employ cavalry, which took the place of chariots, and had a reputation for both prowess and brutality. At their height, the Assyrians dominated all of the Levant, Egypt, and Babylonia. However, the empire began to collapse toward the end of the 7th century&nbsp;BC, and was obliterated by an alliance between a resurgent [[New Kingdom of Babylonia]] and the Iranian [[Medes]].\n\nThe subsequent balance of power was short-lived, though. In the 550s&nbsp;BC the [[Persian people|Persians]] revolted against the Medes and gained control of their empire, and over the next few decades annexed to it the realms of [[Lydia]] in [[Anatolia]], [[Damascus]], [[Babylonia]], and [[Egypt]], as well as consolidating their control over the Iranian plateau nearly as far as [[India]]. This vast kingdom was divided up into various [[satrap]]ies and governed roughly according to the Assyrian model, but with a far lighter hand. Around this time [[Zoroastrianism]] became the predominant religion in [[Iran|Persia]].\n\n==Classical Age==\n[[Iran|Persia]] controlled the Levant, but by the 4th century&nbsp;BC Persia had fallen into decline. The Phoenicians on the coast started many unsuccessful rebellions against the Persians who taxed them a lot, while the Jews were more relaxed under the Persian rule especially after the return from the exile that Cyrus the Great granted them. [[Ten Thousand|The campaigns]] of [[Xenophon]] in 401-399 BC illustrated how very vulnerable Persia had become to armies organized along [[ancient Greece|Greek]] lines. Such an army under the Macedonian King [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the Levant (333-332 BC).\n\nAlexander did not live long enough to consolidate his realm; after his death in 323 BC the greater share of the east eventually went to [[Seleucid Empire|the descendants]] of [[Seleucus I Nicator]]. This period saw great innovations in mathematics, science, architecture, and the like, and Greeks founded cities throughout the east, some of which grew to be the world's first major metropolises.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} [[Hellenistic culture]] did not, however, reach very far into the countryside. The Seleucids brought lots of Greeks, in addition to the descendants of the soldiers who served in the army of Alexander, from Greek cities to populate new cities founded all over the Levant.\nThe [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucids]] (312 to 63 BC) adopted a pro-western stance that alienated both the powerful eastern satraps and many Greeks who had migrated to the east. During the 2nd century&nbsp;BC, Greek culture lost ground in the Levant, and the Seleucid Empire began to break apart. The Seleucid decline continued, and the [[Roman Republic]] overran the Seleucid heartland in 65&nbsp;BC. Judea, which [[Maccabean Revolt|had become independent]] under the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] (140 BC - 37 BC), was annexed by Rome in 63&nbsp;BC and became [[Iudaea Province]] (6 - 135 AD). Approximately 5 Roman legions were placed in the Levant proper for a couple of centuries until they eventually fade from historical records in the start of the 5th century. \n\nA Persian dynasty, the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] (224-651), periodically clashed with [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and later with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 391 the Byzantine era began with the permanent division of the Roman Empire into Eastern and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves. Byzantine control over many parts of the Levant lasted until 636, when [[Arabs|Arab]] armies [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered the area]] and it became a part of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]].\n\nThe [[Byzantium|Byzantines]] reached a low point under [[Phocas]] ([[Byzantine Emperor]] from 602 to 610), with the Sassanids occupying the whole of the eastern Mediterranean. In 610, though, [[Heraclius]] took the throne in [[Constantinople]] and began a successful counter-attack, expelling the [[Persian people|Persians]] and invading [[Medes|Media]] and [[Assyria]]. Unable to stop his advance, the Sassanian king [[Khosrau II]] was assassinated (628) and the Sassanid empire fell into anarchy. Weakened by their quarrels, neither the Byzantines nor the Sassanids could deal with the onslaught of the [[Arabs]], newly unified under the banners of [[Islam]] and keen to expand their area of control. By 650 [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab forces had conquered]] all of [[Iran|Persia]], [[Syria (region)|Syria]], and [[Upper Egypt|Egypt]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ancient Near East]]\n* [[History of the Northern Levant]]\n** [[History of Cyprus]]\n* [[History of the Southern Levant]]\n** [[History of Israel]] \n** [[History of Palestine (region)]]\n** [[History of the Southeastern Levant]]\n** [[Pre-history of the Southern Levant]]\n** [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n** [[History of the Sinai Peninsula]]\n*[[History of Islam]]\n*[[History of the Middle East]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General references===\n* Philip Mansel, ''Levant: Splendour and Catastrophe on the Mediterranean'', London, John Murray, 11 November 2010, hardback, 480 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-7195-6707-0}}, New Haven, Yale University Press, 24 May 2011, hardback, 470 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-300-17264-5}}\n\n{{Commons category|History of the Levant}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/Levant.html The History of the Ancient Near East]\n\n{{Ancient states and regions of the Levant}}\n{{Prehistoric Asia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Levant}}\n[[Category:Ancient Levant| ]]\n", "name_user": "Daniel Ali", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClassical Age:fixed mistake", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_ancient_Levant"}
