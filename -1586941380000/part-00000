Ahmed bin Said threw 12,000 men under the command of Kandhala bin Saif Al Suwaidi in an attack on Ras Al Khaimah which was met at Buraimi by 14,000 men of the Al Qasimi and [[Na'im]]. They were defeated, leading the garrison at [[Khor Fakkan]], besieged by Ahmed bin Said, to surrender. He went on to take Khasab and then blockaded Ras Al Khaimah, [[Rams (Ras Al Khaimah)|Rams]], Jazirat Al Hamra, Fasht and [[Sharjah]]. This led to all but Ras Al Khaimah suing for peace in 1763. The Sheikhs of Ras Al Khaimah submitted in 1771, but in 1775 revolted and re-took the towns on the West and East coast, consolidating their gains under the weak rule of Sultan bin Ahmed bin Saeed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Arabian Gulf Intelligence|last=|first=|publisher=Oleander Press|year=1985|isbn=9781909349964|location=Cambridge|pages=6-8}}</ref> This longstanding war between the Al Qasimi and Muscat pitted them naturally against Muscat's ally \u2013 Britain.\n\nIn the aftermath of a series of attacks in 1808 off the coast of [[Sindh]] involving 50 Qasimi raiders and following the 1809 monsoon season, the British authorities in India decided to make a significant show of force against the Al Qasimi, in an effort not only to destroy their larger bases and as many ships as could be found, but also to counteract French encouragement of them from their embassies in Persia and Oman.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 5, 1808&ndash;1811|last=James|first=William|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|year=2002|isbn=0-85177-909-3|location=|page=204|chapter=|authorlink=William James (naval historian)|origyear=1827}}</ref> The British mounted the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809, in which the Al Qasimi fleet was largely destroyed.

Ahmed bin Said threw 12,000 men under the command of Kandhala bin Saif Al Suwaidi in an attack on Ras Al Khaimah which was met at Buraimi by 14,000 men of the Al Qasimi and [[Na'im]]. They were defeated, leading the garrison at [[Khor Fakkan]], besieged by Ahmed bin Said, to surrender. He went on to take Khasab and then blockaded Ras Al Khaimah, [[Rams (Ras Al Khaimah)|Rams]], Jazirat Al Hamra, Fasht and [[Sharjah]]. This led to all but Ras Al Khaimah suing for peace in 1763.

He leads the generation of young troubadours responding with verve to the world we have dumped on them.\"\n\nIn 2009 Roos presented a semi-staged reading of a new play ''Son of Many Fathers'', with [[Derek Jacobi]] in the lead, directed by [[Di Trevis]] at the European School of Young Performers, and in 2010 showcased a performance of his most recent play ''Her Holiness the Pope'' at [[LAMDA]].  Sir Derek has written of his work \"Graham Roos writes with a directness and urgency embracing both intellectual and emotional clarity. His characters are authentic and speak with individuality.

He transitioned from independent to studio filmmaking with ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'' (2002), and found further critical and commercial success with ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), and ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), which received eight Oscar nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and Best Original Screenplay. This was followed by ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'' (2014) and ''[[Dunkirk (2017 film)|Dunkirk]]'' (2017), the latter of which earned him Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\nNolan's films are typically rooted in [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, exploring human morality, the construction of [[time]], and the malleable nature of [[memory]] and [[personal identity]].

The traditional nomadic Qashqai travelled with their flocks twice yearly to and from the summer highland pastures north of Shiraz roughly 480&nbsp;km or 300&nbsp;miles south to the winter pastures on lower (and warmer) lands near the [[Persian Gulf]], to the southwest of Shiraz. The majority, however, have now become partially or wholly [[sedentism|sedentary]]. The trend towards settlement has been increasing markedly since the 1960s.\n\nThe Qashqai are made up of five major tribes:  the ''Amale'' (Qashqai) / ''Amaleh'' (Persian), the ''Dere-Shorlu / Darreh-Shuri'', the ''Kashkollu / Kashkuli'', the ''Shishbeyli / Sheshboluki'', and the ''Eymur / Farsimadan''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Le qashqay: langue turcique d'Iran|last=Dolatkhah|first=Sohrab|publisher=CreateSpace, Independent Publishing Platform.|year=2016|isbn=|location=Online|pages=13|quote=|via=}}</ref>  Smaller tribes include the ''Qaracha / Qarache'i'', ''Rahimli / Rahimi'', and ''Safi-Khanli / Safi-Khani''.\n\n== History ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size: 100%; \"\n|-\n[[Image:Ethnicities and religions in Iran.png|thumb|300px|Right|Qashqai in Iran (red)]]\n|-\n|}\nHistorically, the Turkic languages are believed to have arrived in Iran from Central Asia from the 11th or 12th centuries onwards.\n\n:\"To survive, [[nomad]]s have always been obliged to fight. They lead a wandering life and do not accumulate documents and archives.\n:But in the evenings, around fires that are burning low, the elders will relate striking events, deeds of valour in which the tribes pride themselves. Thus the epic tale is told from father to son, down through the ages.\n:The tribes of Central Asia were forced by wars, strife, upheavals, to abandon their steppes and seek new pasture grounds...so the [[Huns]], the [[Visigoths]], and before them the [[Aryan]]s, had invaded India, Iran, Europe.\n:The Turks, forsaking the regions where they had dwelt for centuries, started moving down through the [[Altai Mountains]] and [[Caspian Depression|Caspian]] depressions, establishing themselves eventually on the frontiers of the Iranian Empire and in Asia Minor.\n:Though these versions differ, we believe that the arrival of our Tribes in Iran coincided with the conquests of [[Jengis Khan|Ghengis Khan]], in the thirteenth century. Soon after, our ancestors established themselves on the slopes of the Caucasus. We are descendants of the \"Tribe of the Ak Koyunlu\" the \"Tribe of the White Sheep\" famed for being the only tribe in history capable of inflicting a defeat on [[Tamerlane]]. For centuries we dwelt on the lands surrounding [[Ardebil]], but, in the first half of the sixteenth century we settled in southern Persia, [[Shah Ismail]] having asked our warriors to defend this part of the country against the intrusions of the Portuguese. Thus, our Tribes came to the Province of [[Fars Province|Fars]], near the Persian Gulf, and are still only separated from it by a ridge of mountains, the [[Makran]].\n:The yearly migrations of the Kashkai, seeking fresh pastures, drive them from the south to the north, where they move to their summer quarters \"[[Yaylak|Yailaq]]\" in the high mountains; and from the north to the south, to their winter quarters, \"[[Qishlaq]]\".\n:In summer, the Kashkai flocks graze on the slopes of the Kuh-\u00e8-Dinar; a group of mountains from 12,000 to 15,000 feet, that are part of the [[Zagros]] chain.\n:In autumn the Kashkai break camp, and by stages leave the highlands. They winter in the warmer regions near Firuzabad, Kazerun, Jerr\u00e8, Farashband, on the banks of the river Mound, till, in April, they start once more on their yearly trek.\n:The migration is organised and controlled by the Kashkai Chief. The Tribes carefully avoid villages and towns such as Shiraz and Isfahan, lest their flocks, estimated at seven million head, might cause serious damage. The annual migration is the largest of any Persian tribe.\n:It is difficult to give exact statistics, but we believe that the Tribes now number 400,000 men, women and children.\" Told to Marie-T\u00e8r\u00e9se Ullens de Schooten by the 'Il Begh' Malek Mansur, brother of the 'Il Khan', Nasser Khan, Chief of the Kashkai Tribes, in 1953.<ref>Ullens de Schooten, Marie-T\u00e8r\u00e9se.

Thus, our Tribes came to the Province of [[Fars Province|Fars]], near the Persian Gulf, and are still only separated from it by a ridge of mountains, the [[Makran]].\n:The yearly migrations of the Kashkai, seeking fresh pastures, drive them from the south to the north, where they move to their summer quarters \"[[Yaylak|Yailaq]]\" in the high mountains; and from the north to the south, to their winter quarters, \"[[Qishlaq]]\".\n:In summer, the Kashkai flocks graze on the slopes of the Kuh-\u00e8-Dinar; a group of mountains from 12,000 to 15,000 feet, that are part of the [[Zagros]] chain.\n:In autumn the Kashkai break camp, and by stages leave the highlands.

With the end of [[World War II]], the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Joseph Stalin]], and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], more gangs emerged in a flourishing [[black market]], exploiting the unstable governments of the former Republics, and at its highest point, even controlling as much as two-thirds of the Russian economy.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Louis Freeh]], former director of the [[FBI]], said that the Russian mafia posed the greatest threat to [[National Security of the United States|U.S. national security]] in the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"Freeh\" />\n\nIn modern times, there are as many as 6,000 different groups,<ref name=\"fas.org\" /> with more than 200 of them having a global reach. Criminals of these various groups are either former prison members, corrupt officials and business leaders, people with ethnic ties, or people from the same region with shared criminal experiences and leaders.{{Clarify|date=August 2013}}<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> In December 2009, Timur Lakhonin, the head of the Russian National Central Bureau of [[Interpol]], stated \"Certainly, there is crime involving our former compatriots abroad, but there is no data suggesting that an organized structure of criminal groups comprising former Russians exists abroad\",<ref name=\"Lakhonin\" /> while in August 2010, [[Alain Bauer]], a French criminologist, said that it \"is one of the best structured criminal organizations in Europe, with a quasi-military operation.\"<ref name=\"Bauer\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Russian criminality can be traced back to Russia's [[Russian Empire|imperial period]], which began in the 1720s, in the form of banditry and thievery. Most of the population were [[peasants]], in poverty at the time, and criminals who stole from government entities and divided profits among the people earned [[Robin Hood]]-like status, being viewed as protectors of the poor and becoming [[folk heroes]]. In time, the ''Vorovskoy Mir'' (Thieves' World) emerged as these criminals grouped and started their own code of conduct that was based on strict loyalty with one another and opposition against the government. When the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] came around in 1917, the Thieves' World was alive and active. [[Vladimir Lenin]] attempted to wipe them out, but failed, and the criminals survived into [[Joseph Stalin]]'s reign.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\n===1917\u20131991: Soviet era===\nDuring Stalin's reign as ruler, millions of people were sent to ''[[gulag]]s'' (Soviet labor camps), where powerful criminals worked their way up to become ''vorami v zakone'' (\"thieves-in-law\"). These criminal elite often conveyed their status through complicated tattoos, symbols still used by Russian mobsters.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter [[Hitler]]'s [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]], Stalin was recruiting more men to fight for the nation, offering prisoners freedom if they joined the army. Many flocked to help out in the war, but this act betrayed codes of the Thieves' World that one must not ally with the government. Those who chose not to fight in the war referred to the traitors as ''suka'' (\"bitch\"), and the traitors landed at the bottom of the \"hierarchy\". Outcast, the ''suki'' separated from the others and formed their own groups and power bases by collaborating with prison officials, eventually gaining the luxury of comfortable positions. Bitterness between the groups erupted into a series of [[Bitch Wars]] from 1945 to 1953 with many killed every day. The prison officials encouraged the violence, seeing it as a way to rid the prisons of criminals.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Stalin, around eight million inmates were released from ''gulags''. Those that survived the imprisonment and Bitch Wars became a new breed of criminal, no longer bound to the laws of the old Thieves' World. They adopted an \"every-man-for-himself\" attitude that meant cooperating with the government if necessary. This corruption was common during the [[Brezhnev era]], and in the 1970s, small illegal businesses sprang up throughout the country, with the government ignoring them, and the black market thrived. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Then, in the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] loosened restrictions on private businesses, allowing them to grow legally, but by then, the Soviet Union was already beginning to collapse.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAlso during the 1970s and 1980s, the United States expanded its immigration policies, allowing [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jews]], with most settling in a southern [[Brooklyn]] area known as [[Brighton Beach]] (sometimes nicknamed as \"Little [[Odessa]]\").

By 1983, the head of Russian organized crime in Brighton Beach was [[Evsei Agron]].<ref name=\"early US crime\"/>\n\nPauol Mirzoyan was a prime target among other mobsters including rival Boris Goldberg and his organization,<ref name=\"RICO Act\"/> and in May 1985 Agron was assassinated.

This did not stop other people from denying him growing power. In one instance, Ivankov attempted to buy out Georgian boss Valeri \"Globus\" Glugech's drug importation business. When the latter refused the offer, he and his top associates were shot dead. A summit held in May 1994 in [[Vienna]] rewarded him with what was left of Glugech's business.

They also provide an intelligence for the upcoming \"delo\" or on a certain target. They usually stay out of the main actions, although there might be exceptions, depending on circumstances. During a \"delo\" Shestyorkas perform security functions standing on the look out (Shukher \u2013 literally: danger). It is a temporary position and an individual either makes it into the Vor-world or is cast aside. As they are earning their respect and trust in Bratva they may be performing roles of the regular Boyeviks or Byki depending on the necessities and patronage of their Brigadier or Avtorityet.

His job is to watch over the working unit collecting the money while supervising their criminal activities. This group works with the elite group and is equal in power with the Security group. They plan a specific crime for a specialized group or choose who carries out the operation.\n# Working Unit \u2013 There are four Brigadiers running a criminal activity in the working unit.

The acronym OPG is Organized Criminal (''Prestupnaya'' in Russian) Group, used to refer to any of the Russian mafia groups, sometimes modified with a specific name, e.g. Orekhovskaya OPG. Sometimes the initialism is translated and OCG is used.\n\nOrganized crime in Russia began in the imperial period of the [[tsar]]s, but it was not until the Soviet era that ''[[Thief in law|vory v zakone]]'' (\"thieves-in-law\") emerged as leaders of prison groups in [[Gulag|forced labor camps]], and their honor code became more defined. With the end of [[World War II]], the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Joseph Stalin]], and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], more gangs emerged in a flourishing [[black market]], exploiting the unstable governments of the former Republics, and at its highest point, even controlling as much as two-thirds of the Russian economy.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Louis Freeh]], former director of the [[FBI]], said that the Russian mafia posed the greatest threat to [[National Security of the United States|U.S. national security]] in the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"Freeh\" />\n\nIn modern times, there are as many as 6,000 different groups,<ref name=\"fas.org\" /> with more than 200 of them having a global reach. Criminals of these various groups are either former prison members, corrupt officials and business leaders, people with ethnic ties, or people from the same region with shared criminal experiences and leaders.{{Clarify|date=August 2013}}<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> In December 2009, Timur Lakhonin, the head of the Russian National Central Bureau of [[Interpol]], stated \"Certainly, there is crime involving our former compatriots abroad, but there is no data suggesting that an organized structure of criminal groups comprising former Russians exists abroad\",<ref name=\"Lakhonin\" /> while in August 2010, [[Alain Bauer]], a French criminologist, said that it \"is one of the best structured criminal organizations in Europe, with a quasi-military operation.\"<ref name=\"Bauer\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Russian criminality can be traced back to Russia's [[Russian Empire|imperial period]], which began in the 1720s, in the form of banditry and thievery. Most of the population were [[peasants]], in poverty at the time, and criminals who stole from government entities and divided profits among the people earned [[Robin Hood]]-like status, being viewed as protectors of the poor and becoming [[folk heroes]]. In time, the ''Vorovskoy Mir'' (Thieves' World) emerged as these criminals grouped and started their own code of conduct that was based on strict loyalty with one another and opposition against the government. When the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] came around in 1917, the Thieves' World was alive and active. [[Vladimir Lenin]] attempted to wipe them out, but failed, and the criminals survived into [[Joseph Stalin]]'s reign.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\n===1917\u20131991: Soviet era===\nDuring Stalin's reign as ruler, millions of people were sent to ''[[gulag]]s'' (Soviet labor camps), where powerful criminals worked their way up to become ''vorami v zakone'' (\"thieves-in-law\"). These criminal elite often conveyed their status through complicated tattoos, symbols still used by Russian mobsters.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter [[Hitler]]'s [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]], Stalin was recruiting more men to fight for the nation, offering prisoners freedom if they joined the army. Many flocked to help out in the war, but this act betrayed codes of the Thieves' World that one must not ally with the government. Those who chose not to fight in the war referred to the traitors as ''suka'' (\"bitch\"), and the traitors landed at the bottom of the \"hierarchy\". Outcast, the ''suki'' separated from the others and formed their own groups and power bases by collaborating with prison officials, eventually gaining the luxury of comfortable positions. Bitterness between the groups erupted into a series of [[Bitch Wars]] from 1945 to 1953 with many killed every day. The prison officials encouraged the violence, seeing it as a way to rid the prisons of criminals.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Stalin, around eight million inmates were released from ''gulags''. Those that survived the imprisonment and Bitch Wars became a new breed of criminal, no longer bound to the laws of the old Thieves' World. They adopted an \"every-man-for-himself\" attitude that meant cooperating with the government if necessary. This corruption was common during the [[Brezhnev era]], and in the 1970s, small illegal businesses sprang up throughout the country, with the government ignoring them, and the black market thrived. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Then, in the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] loosened restrictions on private businesses, allowing them to grow legally, but by then, the Soviet Union was already beginning to collapse.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAlso during the 1970s and 1980s, the United States expanded its immigration policies, allowing [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jews]], with most settling in a southern [[Brooklyn]] area known as [[Brighton Beach]] (sometimes nicknamed as \"Little [[Odessa]]\"). Here is where Russian organized crime began in the US.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"CBS worldwide\"/> The earliest known case of Russian crime in the area was in the mid-1970s by the \"[[Potato Bag Gang]],\" a group of [[con artists]] disguised as merchants that told customers that they were selling antique gold [[rubles]] for cheap, but in fact, gave them bags of potatoes when bought in thousands. By 1983, the head of Russian organized crime in Brighton Beach was [[Evsei Agron]].<ref name=\"early US crime\"/>\n\nPauol Mirzoyan was a prime target among other mobsters including rival Boris Goldberg and his organization,<ref name=\"RICO Act\"/> and in May 1985 Agron was assassinated. [[Boris Nayfeld|Boris \"Biba\" Nayfeld]], his bodyguard, moved on to employ under [[Marat Balagula]], who was believed to have succeeded Agron's authority. In the following year, Balagula fled the country after he was convicted in a fraud scheme of [[Merrill Lynch]] customers, and was found in [[Frankfurt]], [[West Germany]] in 1989, where he was extradited back to the US and sentenced to eight years in prison.<ref name=\"early US crime\"/>\n\nBalagula would later be convicted on a separate $360,000 [[credit card fraud]] in 1992.<ref name=\"influx of gangsters\"/> Nayfield took Balagula's place, partnering with the \"Polish Al Capone\", Ricardo Fanchiniin, in an import-export business and setting up a heroin business.<ref name=\"Ricardo Fanchini\"/> In 1990, his former friend, Monya Elson, back from a six-year prison sentence in Israel, returned to America and set up a rival heroin business, culminating in a mafia turf war.<ref name=\"Elson and Nayfield\"/>\n\n===1992\u20132000: Growth and internationalization===\nWhen the USSR collapsed and a free market economy emerged, organized criminal groups began to take over Russia's economy, with many ex-[[KGB]] agents and veterans of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Afghan war]] offering their skills to the crime bosses.<ref name=\"Freeh\" /> Gangster [[Summit (meeting)|summit meetings]] had taken place in hotels and restaurants shortly before the Soviet's dissolution, so that top ''vory v zakone'' could agree on who would rule what, and set plans on how to take over the post-Communist states. It was agreed that [[Vyacheslav Ivankov|Vyacheslav \"Yaponchik\" Ivankov]] would be sent to Brighton Beach in 1992, allegedly because he was killing too many people in Russia and also to take control of Russian organized crime in North America.<ref name=\"CBS worldwide\" /> Within a year, he built an international operation that included, but was not limited to, [[narcotics]], [[money laundering]], and [[prostitution]] and made ties with the [[American Mafia]] and Colombian [[drug cartels]], eventually extending to [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Boston]].<ref name=\"history channel\" /> Those who went against him were usually killed.\n\nPrior to Ivankov's arrival, Balagula's downfall left a void for America's next ''vory v zakone''. Monya Elson, leader of Monya's ''Brigada'' (a gang that similarly operated from Russia to Los Angeles to New York), was in a feud with Boris Nayfeld, with bodies dropping on both sides.<ref name=\"Elson and Nayfield\" /> Ivankov's arrival virtually ended the feud, although Elson would later challenge his power as well, and a number of attempts were made to end the former's life.<ref name=\"Ivankov pdf\" /> Nayfield and Elson would eventually be arrested in January 1994 (released in 1998)<ref name=\"Sierra Leone\" /> and in Italy in 1995, respectively.<ref name=\"ny daily news\" />\n\nIvankov's reign also ended in June 1995 when a $3.5 million extortion attempt on two Russian businessmen, Alexander Volkov and Vladimir Voloshin, ended in an FBI arrest that resulted in a ten-year maximum security prison sentence.<ref name=\"Mallory\" /><ref name=\"history channel\" /> Before his arrest and besides his operations in America, Ivankov regularly flew around Europe and Asia to maintain ties with his fellow mobsters (like members of the ''Solntsevskaya Bratva''), as well as reinforce ties with others. This did not stop other people from denying him growing power. In one instance, Ivankov attempted to buy out Georgian boss Valeri \"Globus\" Glugech's drug importation business. When the latter refused the offer, he and his top associates were shot dead. A summit held in May 1994 in [[Vienna]] rewarded him with what was left of Glugech's business. Two months later, Ivankov got into  another altercation with drug kingpin and head of the [[Orekhovskaya gang|''Orekhovskaya'' gang]], Segei \"Sylvester\" Timofeyev, ending with the latter murdered a month later.<ref name=\"Friedman\" />\n\nIn 1995, the [[Camorra]] cooperated with the Russian Mafia in a scheme in which the Camorra would bleach out US$1 bills and reprint them as $100s. These bills would then be transported to the Russian Mafia for distribution in 29 post-[[Eastern Bloc]] countries and former Soviet republics. In return, the Russian Mafia paid the Camorra with property (including a Russian bank) and firearms, smuggled into Eastern Europe and [[Italy]].<ref name=Richards>{{cite book|last=Richards|first=James R.|title=Transnational Criminal Organizations, Cybercrime, and Money Laundering|pages=7|publisher=CRC Press|year=1998|isbn=9781420048728}}</ref>\n\nBack in Eastern Europe in May 1995, crime boss [[Semion Mogilevich]] held a different summit meeting of Russian mafia bosses in his U Holubu restaurant in [[And\u011bl (neighborhood)|And\u011bl]], a neighborhood of [[Prague]]. The excuse to bring them together was that it was a birthday party for Victor Averin, the second-in-command of the ''[[Solntsevskaya Bratva]]''. However, Major Tomas Machacek of the Czech police got wind of an anonymous tip-off that claimed that the ''Solntsevskaya'' were planning to assassinate Mogilevich at the location (it was rumored that Mogilevich and ''Solntsevskaya'' leader [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei Mikhailov]] had a dispute over $5 million), and the police successfully raided the meeting. 200 guests were arrested, but no charges were put against them; only key Russian mafia members were banned from the country, most of whom moved to [[Hungary]].<ref name=\"prague daily\" />\n\nOne person who was not there was Mogilevich himself. He claimed that \"[b]y the time I arrived at U Holubu, everything was already in full swing, so I went into a neighboring hotel and sat in the bar there until about five or six in the morning.\"<ref name=\"Glenny\" /><ref name=\"BBC transcript\" /> Mikhailov would later be arrested in [[Switzerland]] in October 1996 on numerous charges,<ref name=\"Ivankov pdf\" /> including that he was the head of a powerful Russian mafia group, but was exonerated and released two years later after evidence was not enough to prove much.<ref name=\"ny times\" /><ref name=\"la times\" />\n\nThe global extent of Russian organized crime wasn't realized until [[Ludwig Fainberg|Ludwig \"Tarzan\" Fainberg]] was arrested in January 1997, primarily because of arms dealing. In 1990, Fainberg moved from Brighton Beach to [[Miami]] and opened up a strip club called Porky's, which soon became a popular hangout for underworld criminals. Fainberg himself gained a reputation as an [[ambassador]] among international crime groups, becoming especially close to Juan Almeida, a Colombian cocaine dealer. Planning to expand his cocaine business, Fainberg acted as an intermediary between Almeida and the corrupt [[Russian military]]. He helped him get six Russian military helicopters in 1993, and in the following year, helped arrange to buy a [[submarine]] for cocaine smuggling. Unfortunately for the two of them, federal agents had been keeping a close eye on Fainberg for months. Alexander Yasevich, an associate of the Russian military contact and an undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent, was sent to verify the illegal dealing, and in 1997, Fainberg was finally arrested in Miami. Facing the possibility of life imprisonment, the latter agreed for his testimony against Almeida in exchange for a shorter sentence, which ended up being 33 months.<ref name=\"history channel\" /><ref name=\"CBS worldwide\" />\n\n===2001\u2013present===\nAs the 21st century dawned, the Russian mafia remained after the death of Aslan Usoyan. New Mafia bosses sprang up, while imprisoned ones were released.

A Boyevik is in charge of finding new guys and paying tribute up to his Brigadier. Boyeviks also make up the main strike force of a brigade.\n* '''Shestyorka''' \u2013 is an \"associate\" to the organization also called the \"six\", similar to associates in Italian-American Mafia crime families and Sicilian Mafia clans. Is an errand boy for the organization and is the lowest rank in the Russian Mafia. The sixes are assigned to some Avtorityets for support. They also provide an intelligence for the upcoming \"delo\" or on a certain target. They usually stay out of the main actions, although there might be exceptions, depending on circumstances. During a \"delo\" Shestyorkas perform security functions standing on the look out (Shukher \u2013 literally: danger). It is a temporary position and an individual either makes it into the Vor-world or is cast aside. As they are earning their respect and trust in Bratva they may be performing roles of the regular Boyeviks or Byki depending on the necessities and patronage of their Brigadier or Avtorityet. Etymology of 'shestyorka' word comes from the lowest rank of 36 playing card deck \u2013 sixes.\n\nIn the Russian Mafia, \"Vor\" (plural: Vory) (literally, \"Thief\") is an honorary title denoting a [[made man]]. The honor of becoming a Vor is only given when the recruit shows considerable leadership skills, personal ability, intellect and charisma. A Pakhan or another high-ranking member of an organization can decide if the recruit will receive such title. When you become a member of the Vor-world you have to accept the code of the Vor v Zakone (\"[[Thief in law]]\").<ref name=\"Finckenauer, Waring\">James O. Finckenauer and Elin Waring.

One such model (possibly outdated by now, as it is based on the old style of Soviet criminal enterprises) works out like this:\n\n# Elite group \u2013 led by a Pakhan who is involved in management, organization and ideology. This is the highest group that controls both support group and security group.\n# Security group \u2013 is led by one of his spies. His job is to make sure the organization keeps running and also keeps the peace between the organizations and other criminal groups and also paying off the right people. This group works with the Elite group and is equal in power with the Support groups. Is in charge of security and in intelligence.\n# Support group \u2013 is led by one of his spies. His job is to watch over the working unit collecting the money while supervising their criminal activities. This group works with the elite group and is equal in power with the Security group. They plan a specific crime for a specialized group or choose who carries out the operation.\n# Working Unit \u2013 There are four Brigadiers running a criminal activity in the working unit. Each Brigade is controlled by a Brigadier. This is the lowest group working with only the Support group. The group is involved in burglars, thieves, prostitution, extortion, street gangs and other crimes.\n\n==Notable individual groups==\n'''Groups based in and around the [[Moscow|City of Moscow]]:'''\n\n* ''[[Solntsevskaya Bratva]]'': Led by [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei \"Mikhas\" Mikhailov]], it is Russia's largest criminal group with about 5,000 members, and is named after the [[Solntsevo District]].<ref name=\"focus features\"/><ref name=\"BBC rise\"/>\n* Lyuberetskaya Bratva (Russian: \u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0430) or Lyubery (Russian: \u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u044b): One of the largest criminal groups in late 1980s \u2013 early-mid-1990s in the USSR.
