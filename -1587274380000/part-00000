Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and [[desk]]s), or to store things (e.g., [[cupboard]]s and [[Shelf (storage)|shelves]]). Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of [[decorative art]]. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of [[woodworking joints]] which often reflect the local culture.\n\nPeople have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation. Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a [[Venus figurine]] found in [[Russia]], depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of [[Skara Brae]] in [[Scotland]], and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques such as [[joinery (woodworking)|joinery]] began in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic]] period of [[ancient Egypt]]. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including [[stool (seat)|stools]] and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], with thrones being commonplace as well as the [[klinai]], multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by [[revival styles]]. The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards [[Modernism]]. One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.<ref name=povo />\n\n'''strength and quaility  me sabse aage Sujita furniture wholesaler,station road,naugachia,distt-bhagalpur,state-Bihar,mob no-9973378055'''\n\n\nSujita furniture wholesaler,station road(near purana machli\u00a0 no-9973378055,propieter-Barun sharma all wood furniture made our shop full strong ki guaranity ke sath without any problem ke .yaha box plang or diwan plang,metro plang,dining table,dressing table or sighardan,sofa set,alna,mitkesh,sandhuk,table,chair,counter,bench,chokhat,darwaja,center table,and all furniture banaya jata hai.so please ak baar aakar ya call kar moka de ,kabhi ghumne ka bhi vakt mile to ak baar jarur aave .pure bihar me furniture bheja jata hai,duri ki chinta na kare bihar se aage tak bhi saman bheja jata hai ,chinta na kare.saadi,bhay ya ghar ke liye furniture avasay le.ak baar moka de.guaranti manchahe le 200saal,400saal,pakki kagaj ke saath.location ke liye google par search kare sujita furniture house \n\nHamara Website hai-https://Sujita-furniture-house-varun-sharma.business.site\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:furniture|furniture]]'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[wikt:fourniture|fourniture]]'',{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|2016}} the noun form of ''[[wikt:fournir|fournir]]'', which means to supply or provide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fournir|title=English Translation of \"fournir\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> Thus ''fourniture'' in French means supplies or provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fourniture|title=English Translation of \"fourniture\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is specific to that language;{{sfn|Weekley|2013|pp=609\u2013610}} French and other Romance languages as well as German use variants of the word ''[[wikt:meubles|meubles]]'', which derives from Latin ''[[wikt:mobilia|mobilia]]'', meaning \"moveable goods\".{{sfn|Solodow|2010|p=146}}\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric furniture===\n[[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations 1320259 nevit.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] statue is evidence that furniture existed in the [[neolithic]]]]\nThe practice of using natural objects as rudimentary pieces of furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilisation.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} Early humans are likely to have used tree stumps as seats, rocks as rudimentary tables, and mossy areas for sleeping.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} During the late [[palaeolithic]] or early [[neolithic]] period, from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone and animal bones.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=1}} The earliest evidence for the existence of constructed furniture is a [[Venus figurine]] found at the [[Gagarino]] site in [[Russia]], which depicts the goddess in a sitting position, on a throne.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}} A similar [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck|statue of a seated woman]] was found in [[Catal Huyuk]] in [[Turkey]], dating to between 6000 and 5500 BCE.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} The inclusion of such a seat in the figurines implies that these were already common artefacts of that age.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}}\n\n[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Skara Brae]] house home furnishings, a dresser with shelves]]\nA range of unique stone furniture has been excavated in [[Skara Brae]], a [[Neolithic]] village in [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]. The site dates from 3100\u20132500 BCE and due to a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into items for use within the household. Each [[house]] shows a high degree of sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers and beds to shelves, stone seats, and [[limpet]] tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important as it symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic [[Carved Stone Balls]] also found at the site.\n\n[[Ancient Furniture|Ancient furniture]] has been excavated from the 8th-century BCE [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[tumulus]], the Midas Mound, in [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|Gordion]], [[Turkey]]. Pieces found here include [[table (furniture)|tables]] and inlaid serving stands. There are also surviving works from the 9th-8th-century BCE [[Assyria]]n palace of [[Nimrud]]. The earliest surviving carpet, the [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]] Carpet was discovered in a frozen tomb in [[Siberia]] and has been dated between the 6th and 3rd century BCE.\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\n{{main|Art of ancient Egypt#Furniture}}\nCivilisation in [[ancient Egypt]] began with the clearance and irrigation of land along the banks of the [[River Nile]],<ref>Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'' (Charles Schribner's Sons Publishing: New York, 1966) p. 51.</ref> which began in about 6000 BCE. By that time, society in the [[Nile Valley]] was already engaged in organized agriculture and the construction of large buildings.<ref name=\"Redford 6\">Redford, Donald B. ''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times.'' (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 6.</ref>  At this period, Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and also constructing large buildings. [[Mortar (masonry)|Mortar]] was in use by around 4000 BCE The inhabitants of the Nile Valley and delta were self-sufficient and were raising barley and [[emmer]] (an early variety of wheat) and stored it in pits lined with reed mats.<ref name=\"Carl Roebuck p. 52\">Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'', p. 52.</ref>  They raised cattle, goats and pigs and they wove linens and baskets.<ref name=\"Carl Roebuck p. 52\"/> Evidence of furniture from the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]] is scarce, but samples from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] tombs indicate an already advanced use of furnishings in the houses of the age.{{sfn|Metropolitan Museum of Art|1999|p=117}}\n\nDuring the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|dynastic period]], which began in around 3200 BCE, Egyptian art developed significantly, and this included furniture design.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} Egyptian furniture was primarily constructed using wood, but other materials were sometimes used, such as [[leather]],{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} and pieces were often adorned with gold, silver, ivory and ebony, for decoration.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} Wood found in Egypt was not suitable for furniture construction, so it had to be imported into the country from other places,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} particularly [[Phoenicia]].{{sfn|Gadalla|2007|p=243}} The scarcity of wood necessitated innovation in construction techniques. The use of [[scarf joint]]s to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam was one example of this,{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|pp=13\u201314}} as well as construction of [[Wood veneer|veneers]] in which low quality cheap wood was used as the main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=14}}\n\nThe earliest used seating furniture in the dynastic period was the [[stool (seat)|stool]], which was used throughout Egyptian society, from the royal family down to ordinary citizens.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Various different designs were used, including stools with four vertical legs, and others with crossed splayed legs; almost all had rectangular seats, however.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Examples include the workman's stool, a simple three legged structure with a concave seat, designed for comfort during labour,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|p=6}} and the much more ornate folding stool, with crossed folding legs,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} which were decorated with carved duck heads and ivory,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} and had hinges made of [[bronze]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Full [[chair]]s were much rarer in early Egypt, being limited to only wealthy and high ranking people, and seen as a status symbol; they did not reach ordinary households until the [[eighteenth dynasty]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Early examples were formed by adding a straight back to a stool, while later chairs had an inclined back.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables, which are heavily represented in art, but almost nonexistent as preserved items \u2013 perhaps because they were placed outside tombs rather than within,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=21}} as well as beds and storage chests.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=22}}{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=24}}\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStool with woven seat MET 14.10.3 view 4.jpg|Stool with woven seat; 1991\u20131450 BC; wood & reed; height: 13&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJewelry chest of Sithathoryunet MET DP330328.jpg|Jewelry chest of Sithathoryunet; 1887\u20131813 BC; ebony, ivory, gold, carnelian, blue faience and silver; height: 36.7 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nEgyptian Museum 000 (37).jpg|The ''Throne of [[Tutankhamun]]''; 1336\u20131327 BC; wood covered with sheets of gold, silver, [[semi-precious stone|semi-precious]] and other stones, faience, glass and bronze; height: 1&nbsp;m; [[Egyptian Museum]] (Cairo)\n\nHatnefer's Chair MET 21M CAT047R4 (cropped).jpg|Chair of [[Hatnefer]]; 1492\u20131473&nbsp;BC; boxwood, cypress, ebony & linen cord; height: 53&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Greece===\n[[File:Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter. a, b-klismos, and c-chair.jpg|thumb|225px|Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter: a, b-klismos, and c-chair]]\nHistorical knowledge of Greek furniture is derived from various sources, including [[Greek literature|literature]], [[terracotta]], sculptures, statuettes, and painted vases.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Some pieces survive to this day, primarily those constructed from metals, including bronze, or marble.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was an important material in Greek furniture, both domestic and imported.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} A common technique was to construct the main sections of the furniture with cheap solid wood, then apply a veneer using an expensive wood, such as maple or ebony.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Greek furniture construction also made use of [[dowels]] and [[Mortise and tenon|tenons]] for joining the wooden parts of a piece together.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.<ref>Richter, 125.</ref>\n\nThe modern word \u201c[[throne]]\u201d is derived from the ancient Greek ''thronos'' (Greek singular: \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.<ref>Richter, 13.</ref> The colossal chryselephantine statue of [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Zeus at Olympia]], constructed by [[Phidias]] and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].<ref>Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff.</ref> Other Greek seats included the ''[[klismos]]'', an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design,<ref>Linda Maria Gigante, \u201cFunerary Art,\u201d in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed.

Rome gradually superseded Greece as the foremost culture of Europe, leading eventually to Greece becoming a province of Rome in 146 BC. Rome thus took over production and distribution of Greek furniture, and the boundary between the two is blurred. The Romans did have some limited innovation outside of Greek influence, and styles distinctly their own.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nRoman furniture was constructed principally using wood, metal and stone, with marble and limestone used for outside furniture. Very little wooden furniture survives intact, but there is evidence that a variety of woods were used, including maple, citron, beech, oak, and holly. Some imported wood such as satinwood was used for decoration. The most commonly used metal was bronze, of which numerous examples have survived, for example, headrests for couches and metal stools. Similar to the Greeks, [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] used tenons, dowels, nails, and glue to join wooden pieces together, and also practised veneering.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nThe 1738 and 1748 excavations of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] revealed Roman furniture, preserved in the ashes of the AD 79 [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of Vesuvius]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nHandbook of ornament; a grammar of art, industrial and architectural designing in all its branches, for practical as well as theoretical use (1900) (14804265373).jpg|Illustration of Roman furniture details, from 1900, very similar with [[Empire style]] furniture\nClevelandart 1995.10.jpg|Tripod base; circa 100 BC; bronze; overall: 77 x 32.3 x 28&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], USA)\nForziere con sacrificio a giove, I secolo dc, legno, ferro e bronzo, con ageminature, dalla casa di trittolemo a pompei (napoli, man) 01.jpg|Treasure chest with a sacrifice of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] depicted on it; 1st century AD; wood, iron and bronze, with ageminature; from [[Pompeii]]; [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples|Naples National Archaeological Museum]] ([[Naples]], Italy)\nCouch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays MET DP138722.jpg|Couch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays; 1st\u20132nd century AD; wood, bone and glass; couch: 105.4 \u00d7 76.2 \u00d7 214.6&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===\n[[File:Cassone (one of a pair) MET DP106698.jpg|thumb|Renaissance [[cassone]]; circa 1550-1560; carved and partially gilded walnut; 86.4 x 181.9 x 67.3 cm; from [[Rome]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIn contrast to the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, there is comparatively little evidence of furniture from the 5th to the 15th century.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} Very few extant pieces survive, and evidence in literature is also scarce.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the [[middle ages]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} For example, a throne similar to that of [[Zeus]] is depicted in a sixth-century [[diptych]],{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} while the [[Bayeux tapestry]] shows [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] seated on seats similar to the Roman [[sella curulis]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=35}}\n\nThe furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented with carved designs. Along with the other arts, the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century marked a rebirth in design, often inspired by the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition. A similar explosion of design, and renaissance of culture in general occurred in Northern Europe, starting in the fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs that frequently incorporated a profusion of vegetal and scrolling ornament. Starting in the eighteenth century, furniture designs began to develop more rapidly. Although there were some styles that belonged primarily to one nation, such as [[Palladianism]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Louis Quinze]] in [[French furniture]], others, such as the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were perpetuated throughout Western Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCoffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen) MET DP273975.jpg|[[Gothic art|Gothic]] German coffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen); circa 1325-1350; oak, inlay, tempera, wrought-iron mounts; overall: 12.1 x 27.3 x 16.5; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nPaschal Candlestick MET DP102923.jpg|Gothic Spanish paschal candlestick; circa 1450-1500; wood with paint and gilding; 195.6 \u00d7 43.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCassone (chest), pair with 1975.1.1947 MET SLP1940-1.jpg|[[Renaissance]] cassone (chest); mid 16th century; walnut, carved and partially gilded, coniferous wood; height: 73.6 cm, width: 1.7 m, depth: 63.5 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nDresser (Dressoir aux harpies) MET DP105799.jpg|French Renaissance dresser (dressoir aux harpies); circa 1570-1590; carved walnut with interior elements of oak, pine, and some iron accessories; height: 144.8 cm, width: 137.8 cm, depth: 50.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the eighteenth century, the fashion was set in England by the French art.

In this era, most of the furniture had metal and enamelled decorations in it and some of the furniture was covered in inlays of marbles lapis lazuli, and porphyry and other stones. By mid-century this [[Baroque]] style was displaced by the graceful curves, shining [[ormolu]], and intricate [[marquetry]] of the [[Rococo]] style, which in turn gave way around 1770 to the more severe lines of [[Neoclassicism]], modeled after the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome.\n<ref name=\"A history of feminine fashion\">{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 978-1-289-62694-5|page=71}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nOlanda, guardaroba (kast), 1625-50 ca.jpg|Dutch wardrobe; 1625-1650; oak with ebony and rosewood veneers; overall: 244.5 x 224.3 x 85.2 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nClevelandart 1968.31.jpg|Console table depicting [[Chronos]], or the father time; 1695; painted and gilded wood, with marble at its top; overall: 95.3 x 107.3 x 62.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nGermany, Mainz, 18th century - Gaming Table - 1953.284 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Gaming Table; circa 1735; wood and ivory marquetry; overall: 78.7 x 94 x 54.6 cm; from [[Mainz]] (Germany); Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nCommode by Gilles Joubert, France, c. 1735, oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze, imitation marble - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston - 20180922 164303.jpg|French commode; by [[Gilles Joubert]]; circa 1735; oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze and imitation marble; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], USA)\n\nCommode MET DP105695.jpg|Parisian commode; 1745-1749; pine and oak veneered with amaranth and bois satin\u00e9, walnut, gilt-bronze mounts, and portoro marble top; 87.6 x 139.7 x 57.8 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) (part of a set) MET DP105705.jpg|Armchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine); circa 1754-1756; carved and gilded beech, wool and silk tapestry; overall: 103.8 \u00d7 73.7 \u00d7 66 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJean pierre latz, commode, 1745-50 ca, con terracotta di un seguace di clodion.jpg|Rococo chest of drawers; circa 1750; oak, tulipwood marquetry, gilt metal mounts and marble; overall: 88 x 156.5 x 69.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) MET DP106642.jpg|German armchair; circa 1750\u20131760; carved and gilded beech, covered in blue damask not original to the armchair; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nSk\u00e5p i stora salongen.

Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and [[desk]]s), or to store things (e.g., [[cupboard]]s and [[Shelf (storage)|shelves]]). Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of [[decorative art]]. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of [[woodworking joints]] which often reflect the local culture.\n\nPeople have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation. Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a [[Venus figurine]] found in [[Russia]], depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of [[Skara Brae]] in [[Scotland]], and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques such as [[joinery (woodworking)|joinery]] began in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic]] period of [[ancient Egypt]]. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including [[stool (seat)|stools]] and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], with thrones being commonplace as well as the [[klinai]], multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by [[revival styles]].

The site dates from 3100\u20132500 BCE and due to a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into items for use within the household. Each [[house]] shows a high degree of sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers and beds to shelves, stone seats, and [[limpet]] tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important as it symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic [[Carved Stone Balls]] also found at the site.\n\n[[Ancient Furniture|Ancient furniture]] has been excavated from the 8th-century BCE [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[tumulus]], the Midas Mound, in [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|Gordion]], [[Turkey]].

By that time, society in the [[Nile Valley]] was already engaged in organized agriculture and the construction of large buildings.<ref name=\"Redford 6\">Redford, Donald B. ''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times.'' (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 6.</ref>  At this period, Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and also constructing large buildings. [[Mortar (masonry)|Mortar]] was in use by around 4000 BCE The inhabitants of the Nile Valley and delta were self-sufficient and were raising barley and [[emmer]] (an early variety of wheat) and stored it in pits lined with reed mats.<ref name=\"Carl Roebuck p. 52\">Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'', p. 52.</ref>  They raised cattle, goats and pigs and they wove linens and baskets.<ref name=\"Carl Roebuck p. 52\"/> Evidence of furniture from the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]] is scarce, but samples from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] tombs indicate an already advanced use of furnishings in the houses of the age.{{sfn|Metropolitan Museum of Art|1999|p=117}}\n\nDuring the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|dynastic period]], which began in around 3200 BCE, Egyptian art developed significantly, and this included furniture design.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} Egyptian furniture was primarily constructed using wood, but other materials were sometimes used, such as [[leather]],{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} and pieces were often adorned with gold, silver, ivory and ebony, for decoration.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} Wood found in Egypt was not suitable for furniture construction, so it had to be imported into the country from other places,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} particularly [[Phoenicia]].{{sfn|Gadalla|2007|p=243}} The scarcity of wood necessitated innovation in construction techniques. The use of [[scarf joint]]s to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam was one example of this,{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|pp=13\u201314}} as well as construction of [[Wood veneer|veneers]] in which low quality cheap wood was used as the main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=14}}\n\nThe earliest used seating furniture in the dynastic period was the [[stool (seat)|stool]], which was used throughout Egyptian society, from the royal family down to ordinary citizens.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Various different designs were used, including stools with four vertical legs, and others with crossed splayed legs; almost all had rectangular seats, however.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Examples include the workman's stool, a simple three legged structure with a concave seat, designed for comfort during labour,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|p=6}} and the much more ornate folding stool, with crossed folding legs,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} which were decorated with carved duck heads and ivory,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} and had hinges made of [[bronze]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Full [[chair]]s were much rarer in early Egypt, being limited to only wealthy and high ranking people, and seen as a status symbol; they did not reach ordinary households until the [[eighteenth dynasty]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Early examples were formed by adding a straight back to a stool, while later chairs had an inclined back.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables, which are heavily represented in art, but almost nonexistent as preserved items \u2013 perhaps because they were placed outside tombs rather than within,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=21}} as well as beds and storage chests.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=22}}{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=24}}\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStool with woven seat MET 14.10.3 view 4.jpg|Stool with woven seat; 1991\u20131450 BC; wood & reed; height: 13&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJewelry chest of Sithathoryunet MET DP330328.jpg|Jewelry chest of Sithathoryunet; 1887\u20131813 BC; ebony, ivory, gold, carnelian, blue faience and silver; height: 36.7 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nEgyptian Museum 000 (37).jpg|The ''Throne of [[Tutankhamun]]''; 1336\u20131327 BC; wood covered with sheets of gold, silver, [[semi-precious stone|semi-precious]] and other stones, faience, glass and bronze; height: 1&nbsp;m; [[Egyptian Museum]] (Cairo)\n\nHatnefer's Chair MET 21M CAT047R4 (cropped).jpg|Chair of [[Hatnefer]]; 1492\u20131473&nbsp;BC; boxwood, cypress, ebony & linen cord; height: 53&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Greece===\n[[File:Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter. a, b-klismos, and c-chair.jpg|thumb|225px|Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter: a, b-klismos, and c-chair]]\nHistorical knowledge of Greek furniture is derived from various sources, including [[Greek literature|literature]], [[terracotta]], sculptures, statuettes, and painted vases.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Some pieces survive to this day, primarily those constructed from metals, including bronze, or marble.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was an important material in Greek furniture, both domestic and imported.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} A common technique was to construct the main sections of the furniture with cheap solid wood, then apply a veneer using an expensive wood, such as maple or ebony.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Greek furniture construction also made use of [[dowels]] and [[Mortise and tenon|tenons]] for joining the wooden parts of a piece together.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.<ref>Richter, 125.</ref>\n\nThe modern word \u201c[[throne]]\u201d is derived from the ancient Greek ''thronos'' (Greek singular: \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.<ref>Richter, 13.</ref> The colossal chryselephantine statue of [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Zeus at Olympia]], constructed by [[Phidias]] and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].<ref>Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff.</ref> Other Greek seats included the ''[[klismos]]'', an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design,<ref>Linda Maria Gigante, \u201cFunerary Art,\u201d in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed.

Rome gradually superseded Greece as the foremost culture of Europe, leading eventually to Greece becoming a province of Rome in 146 BC. Rome thus took over production and distribution of Greek furniture, and the boundary between the two is blurred. The Romans did have some limited innovation outside of Greek influence, and styles distinctly their own.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nRoman furniture was constructed principally using wood, metal and stone, with marble and limestone used for outside furniture. Very little wooden furniture survives intact, but there is evidence that a variety of woods were used, including maple, citron, beech, oak, and holly. Some imported wood such as satinwood was used for decoration. The most commonly used metal was bronze, of which numerous examples have survived, for example, headrests for couches and metal stools. Similar to the Greeks, [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] used tenons, dowels, nails, and glue to join wooden pieces together, and also practised veneering.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nThe 1738 and 1748 excavations of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] revealed Roman furniture, preserved in the ashes of the AD 79 [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of Vesuvius]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nHandbook of ornament; a grammar of art, industrial and architectural designing in all its branches, for practical as well as theoretical use (1900) (14804265373).jpg|Illustration of Roman furniture details, from 1900, very similar with [[Empire style]] furniture\nClevelandart 1995.10.jpg|Tripod base; circa 100 BC; bronze; overall: 77 x 32.3 x 28&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], USA)\nForziere con sacrificio a giove, I secolo dc, legno, ferro e bronzo, con ageminature, dalla casa di trittolemo a pompei (napoli, man) 01.jpg|Treasure chest with a sacrifice of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] depicted on it; 1st century AD; wood, iron and bronze, with ageminature; from [[Pompeii]]; [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples|Naples National Archaeological Museum]] ([[Naples]], Italy)\nCouch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays MET DP138722.jpg|Couch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays; 1st\u20132nd century AD; wood, bone and glass; couch: 105.4 \u00d7 76.2 \u00d7 214.6&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===\n[[File:Cassone (one of a pair) MET DP106698.jpg|thumb|Renaissance [[cassone]]; circa 1550-1560; carved and partially gilded walnut; 86.4 x 181.9 x 67.3 cm; from [[Rome]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIn contrast to the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, there is comparatively little evidence of furniture from the 5th to the 15th century.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} Very few extant pieces survive, and evidence in literature is also scarce.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the [[middle ages]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} For example, a throne similar to that of [[Zeus]] is depicted in a sixth-century [[diptych]],{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} while the [[Bayeux tapestry]] shows [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] seated on seats similar to the Roman [[sella curulis]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=35}}\n\nThe furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented with carved designs. Along with the other arts, the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century marked a rebirth in design, often inspired by the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition. A similar explosion of design, and renaissance of culture in general occurred in Northern Europe, starting in the fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs that frequently incorporated a profusion of vegetal and scrolling ornament. Starting in the eighteenth century, furniture designs began to develop more rapidly. Although there were some styles that belonged primarily to one nation, such as [[Palladianism]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Louis Quinze]] in [[French furniture]], others, such as the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were perpetuated throughout Western Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCoffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen) MET DP273975.jpg|[[Gothic art|Gothic]] German coffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen); circa 1325-1350; oak, inlay, tempera, wrought-iron mounts; overall: 12.1 x 27.3 x 16.5; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nPaschal Candlestick MET DP102923.jpg|Gothic Spanish paschal candlestick; circa 1450-1500; wood with paint and gilding; 195.6 \u00d7 43.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCassone (chest), pair with 1975.1.1947 MET SLP1940-1.jpg|[[Renaissance]] cassone (chest); mid 16th century; walnut, carved and partially gilded, coniferous wood; height: 73.6 cm, width: 1.7 m, depth: 63.5 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nDresser (Dressoir aux harpies) MET DP105799.jpg|French Renaissance dresser (dressoir aux harpies); circa 1570-1590; carved walnut with interior elements of oak, pine, and some iron accessories; height: 144.8 cm, width: 137.8 cm, depth: 50.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the eighteenth century, the fashion was set in England by the French art.

In this era, most of the furniture had metal and enamelled decorations in it and some of the furniture was covered in inlays of marbles lapis lazuli, and porphyry and other stones. By mid-century this [[Baroque]] style was displaced by the graceful curves, shining [[ormolu]], and intricate [[marquetry]] of the [[Rococo]] style, which in turn gave way around 1770 to the more severe lines of [[Neoclassicism]], modeled after the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome.\n<ref name=\"A history of feminine fashion\">{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 978-1-289-62694-5|page=71}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nOlanda, guardaroba (kast), 1625-50 ca.jpg|Dutch wardrobe; 1625-1650; oak with ebony and rosewood veneers; overall: 244.5 x 224.3 x 85.2 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nClevelandart 1968.31.jpg|Console table depicting [[Chronos]], or the father time; 1695; painted and gilded wood, with marble at its top; overall: 95.3 x 107.3 x 62.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nGermany, Mainz, 18th century - Gaming Table - 1953.284 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Gaming Table; circa 1735; wood and ivory marquetry; overall: 78.7 x 94 x 54.6 cm; from [[Mainz]] (Germany); Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nCommode by Gilles Joubert, France, c. 1735, oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze, imitation marble - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston - 20180922 164303.jpg|French commode; by [[Gilles Joubert]]; circa 1735; oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze and imitation marble; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], USA)\n\nCommode MET DP105695.jpg|Parisian commode; 1745-1749; pine and oak veneered with amaranth and bois satin\u00e9, walnut, gilt-bronze mounts, and portoro marble top; 87.6 x 139.7 x 57.8 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) (part of a set) MET DP105705.jpg|Armchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine); circa 1754-1756; carved and gilded beech, wool and silk tapestry; overall: 103.8 \u00d7 73.7 \u00d7 66 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJean pierre latz, commode, 1745-50 ca, con terracotta di un seguace di clodion.jpg|Rococo chest of drawers; circa 1750; oak, tulipwood marquetry, gilt metal mounts and marble; overall: 88 x 156.5 x 69.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) MET DP106642.jpg|German armchair; circa 1750\u20131760; carved and gilded beech, covered in blue damask not original to the armchair; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nSk\u00e5p i stora salongen.

[[Art Deco]], [[De Stijl]], [[Bauhaus]], [[Jugendstil]], [[Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte Style|Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte]], and [[Vienna Secession]] designers all worked to some degree within the Modernist idiom. Born from the [[Bauhaus]] and Art Deco/Streamline styles came the post WWII \"[[Mid-Century Modern]]\" style using materials developed during the war including laminated plywood, plastics, and fiberglass. Prime examples include furniture designed by George Nelson Associates, Charles and Ray Eames, [[Paul McCobb]], Florence Knoll, Harry Bertoia, Eero Saarinen, Harvey Probber, Vladamir Kagan and [[Danish modern]] designers including [[Finn Juhl]] and [[Arne Jacobsen]]. [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] design, intersecting the [[Pop art]] movement, gained steam in the 1960s and 70s, promoted in the 80s by groups such as the Italy-based [[Memphis movement]].

It is worth noting that Chinese furniture varies dramatically from one dynasty to the next.\n\nTraditional Japanese furniture is well known for its [[minimalism|minimalist]] style, extensive use of wood, high-quality craftsmanship and reliance on wood grain instead of painting or thick lacquer. Japanese chests are known as [[Tansu]], known for elaborate decorative iron work, and are some of the most sought-after of Japanese antiques.

He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]].

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Biden is the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|presumptive Democratic nominee]] for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]].

Prior to appearing on the show, Linscott gained much research on women prisoners and approached the Appartment of Correctional Services in New South Wales and organised to spend some time inside one of their maximum security prisons. She also did extensive research on bikie gangs, spending a lot of time with real-life bikie Ian Doig who played her boyfriend \"Slasher\" in the series.<ref>''\"Prisoner's Tall Story\"'' \u2013 [[TV Week]], issue published 24 August 1985, p.81.</ref>\n\nShe later returned to Britain when she appeared in a stage play version of Prisoner.

A graduate of the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] (NIDA), Linscott's most notable role is that of Rita \"The Beater\" Connors in the cult classic Network Ten prison drama ''Prisoner'', for which she first appeared towards the end of the seventh season in 1985, while the character became immensely popular during the final season in 1986, despite the show's decline in ratings at that time. Prior to appearing on the show, Linscott gained much research on women prisoners and approached the Appartment of Correctional Services in New South Wales and organised to spend some time inside one of their maximum security prisons. She also did extensive research on bikie gangs, spending a lot of time with real-life bikie Ian Doig who played her boyfriend \"Slasher\" in the series.<ref>''\"Prisoner's Tall Story\"'' \u2013 [[TV Week]], issue published 24 August 1985, p.81.</ref>\n\nShe later returned to Britain when she appeared in a stage play version of Prisoner. Guest roles include [[A Country Practice]], [[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]] and [[McLeod's Daughters]]. She also had a recurring role in the Australian drama, ''[[Murder Call]]'' as [[Pathologist]], [[Doctor (title)|Dr.]] Imogen Soames between 1997\u20132000.\n\nIn November 2011, it was announced Linscott had joined the cast of ''[[Neighbours]]'' for three months as Dr. [[Jessica Girdwood]], a [[surgeon]] at the [[Erinsborough#Erinsborough Hospital|Erinsborough Hospital]].

I, p. 4: At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\n==== Conspiracy or coordination ====\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement \u2014 tacit or express \u2014 between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement \u2014 tacit or express \u2014 between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts.

Some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office's judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information-such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media-in light of internal Department of Justice policies. See, ''e.g.'', Justice Manual \u00a7\u00a7 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or \"taint\") team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as well-numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United States.

I, p. 4: At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\n==== Conspiracy or coordination ====\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement \u2014 tacit or express \u2014 between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement \u2014 tacit or express \u2014 between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts.

Some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office's judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information-such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media-in light of internal Department of Justice policies. See, ''e.g.'', Justice Manual \u00a7\u00a7 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or \"taint\") team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as well-numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United States.
