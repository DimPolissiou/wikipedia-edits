The College has campuses in [[Watford]], [[Hemel Hempstead]] and [[Kings Langley]].\n\n==Range of courses==\nCourses offered are vocational and [[apprenticeship]]s. The College works with local secondary schools to offer entry to applicants of 14 years of age and older. Some school pupils may transfer their full-time education to the College in order to restart their education or to take some vocational subjects at Level 1, either as full subjects or as \"tasters\" (to judge suitability). A few [[GCSE]] subjects are offered to gifted pupils.\n\nTertiary qualifications (foundation and extended degrees and [[Higher National Diploma]]s) are offered, overseen by the [[University of Hertfordshire]]  (UH). The foundation degrees may lead on to full [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] or [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] awards elsewhere, while extended degrees provide the entry requirements for a degree course at UH. In addition a number of stand-alone courses are offered to part-time students for personal development or leisure.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Watford, West Herts College, Hempstead Road campus - geograph.org.uk - 982206.jpg|thumb|right|The former Lanchester Building (1938)]]\nThe '''Watford Library and School of Science and Art''' began in 1874 on Queens Road, Watford. A new building on Hempstead Road for the college was designed by the architects [[Henry Vaughan Lanchester]] and [[Thomas Arthur Lodge]]<ref name=\"local_list\"/> and construction of the large, [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco]]-style college, known as the ''Lanchester Building'', began in 1938. The new college was located on former lands of the [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury Estate]], sold by the [[Earl of Essex]]. Although the stately home was demolished in 1927, the 17th-century [[dower house]], Little Cassiobury, remained. Progress on the new building was interrupted by the advent of [[World War II]] and the building remained unfinished throughout the 1940s. '''Watford Technical College''' was founded in 1947<ref>{{cite news|title=West Herts College|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/az-uni-colleges/west-herts-college-459110.html|accessdate=12 November 2014|work=the Independent|date=9 August 2013}}</ref> but it was not until 1953 that Watford Technical College was officially opened in its new premises.<ref name=cooper>{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=John|title=Watford Through Time|date=2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=9781445632032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lpOIAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT16&dq=watford%20college%20history&pg=PT16#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s '''Watford College of Technology''' merged with the George Stephenson College (built 1965/66)<ref>''[[The Buildings of England]], Hertfordshire'', 2nd edition page 388</ref> to form '''Watford College'''. West Herts College was established in 1991 as part of the reorganisation of Further Education in Hertfordshire. It was created from the two local colleges Watford College and '''Cassio College''', and '''Dacorum College''' in Hemel Hempstead. A new Watford Campus building was constructed in the early 21st century and West Herts College vacated the Lanchester Building; now a locally [[listed building]] due to its architectural merit;<ref name=\"local_list\">{{cite web|title=Appendix 6 - Locally Listed Buildings|url=http://www.watford.gov.uk/ccm/content/planning-and-development/district-plan-2000/appendix-6---locally-listed-buildings/|website=Wtfrod Borough Council|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref> the Lanchester Building is due to be converted into a [[primary school]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Mike|title=Work to turn Lanchester building, in West Herts College, into Watford Town Community Free School to begin|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/10984764.Work_to_build_new_school_in_central_Watford_to_begin/?ref=rss|accessdate=12 November 2014|work=[[Watford Observer]]|date=4 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 the College was awarded a Gold rating in the [[Teaching Excellence Framework]] administered by the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].<ref>[http://www.hefce.ac.uk/tefoutcomes/#/provider/10007417] Teaching Excellence Framework outcomes</ref>\n\nFormer principals include Elizabeth Rushton (2004-2011), Tony Pitcher (2003-2004),<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/apr/06/furthereducation.uk | title=Principal to oust 100 | date=6 April 2004 | newspaper=The Guardian | accessdate=9 October 2019 }}</ref> and Andrew Bragg (1997 to 2003).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/3611117.stm | title=Colleges judged 'inadequate' | date=8 April 2004 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=9 October 2019 }}</ref> Former Watford College principals include Terry Howard (? - 1986), Frank Baker (1986 - 1996), John Loveridge (1996 - 1997).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Controversy==\nDuring the year of 2018, late February, George Duke-Cohan a student of the college sent a threatening email stating that a bomb had been planted in the C-block of the college. The building was quickly evacuated and students were sent to the leisure centre located next to the college. Law enforcement were notified of the threat and an investigation then followed. George later admitted to being the perpetrator \u2014 this resulted in his suspension from the college.\n\nOn March of the same year, George sent numerous emails to over 400 schools across the UK, using hijacked email addresses from the gaming community VeltPvP. The attacks affected schools in London, Manchester, and North Yorkshire. North Yorkshire Police state the following, regarding the incident \"Our cybercrime unit detectives, supported by local officers, have looked at these incidents and it is not believed there is any genuine threat\". The investigation put forward resulted in the arrest of George on 19 March, he was later released under investigation.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43457548] BBC News Article \"School bomb threats: Disgruntled Minecraft gamer 'behind hoax'\"</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, George was rearrested after carrying out another hoax, this time targeting a United Airlines flight from the UK to San Francisco.

The College has campuses in [[Watford]], [[Hemel Hempstead]] and [[Kings Langley]].\n\n==Range of courses==\nCourses offered are vocational and [[apprenticeship]]s. The College works with local secondary schools to offer entry to applicants of 14 years of age and older. Some school pupils may transfer their full-time education to the College in order to restart their education or to take some vocational subjects at Level 1, either as full subjects or as \"tasters\" (to judge suitability). A few [[GCSE]] subjects are offered to gifted pupils.\n\nTertiary qualifications (foundation and extended degrees and [[Higher National Diploma]]s) are offered, overseen by the [[University of Hertfordshire]]  (UH). The foundation degrees may lead on to full [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] or [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] awards elsewhere, while extended degrees provide the entry requirements for a degree course at UH. In addition a number of stand-alone courses are offered to part-time students for personal development or leisure.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Watford, West Herts College, Hempstead Road campus - geograph.org.uk - 982206.jpg|thumb|right|The former Lanchester Building (1938)]]\nThe '''Watford Library and School of Science and Art''' began in 1874 on Queens Road, Watford. A new building on Hempstead Road for the college was designed by the architects [[Henry Vaughan Lanchester]] and [[Thomas Arthur Lodge]]<ref name=\"local_list\"/> and construction of the large, [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco]]-style college, known as the ''Lanchester Building'', began in 1938. The new college was located on former lands of the [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury Estate]], sold by the [[Earl of Essex]]. Although the stately home was demolished in 1927, the 17th-century [[dower house]], Little Cassiobury, remained. Progress on the new building was interrupted by the advent of [[World War II]] and the building remained unfinished throughout the 1940s. '''Watford Technical College''' was founded in 1947<ref>{{cite news|title=West Herts College|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/az-uni-colleges/west-herts-college-459110.html|accessdate=12 November 2014|work=the Independent|date=9 August 2013}}</ref> but it was not until 1953 that Watford Technical College was officially opened in its new premises.<ref name=cooper>{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=John|title=Watford Through Time|date=2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=9781445632032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lpOIAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT16&dq=watford%20college%20history&pg=PT16#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s '''Watford College of Technology''' merged with the George Stephenson College (built 1965/66)<ref>''[[The Buildings of England]], Hertfordshire'', 2nd edition page 388</ref> to form '''Watford College'''. West Herts College was established in 1991 as part of the reorganisation of Further Education in Hertfordshire. It was created from the two local colleges Watford College and '''Cassio College''', and '''Dacorum College''' in Hemel Hempstead.

The building was quickly evacuated and students were sent to the leisure centre located next to the college. Law enforcement were notified of the threat and an investigation then followed. George later admitted to being the perpetrator \u2014 this resulted in his suspension from the college.\n\nOn March of the same year, George sent numerous emails to over 400 schools across the UK, using hijacked email addresses from the gaming community VeltPvP. The attacks affected schools in London, Manchester, and North Yorkshire. North Yorkshire Police state the following, regarding the incident \"Our cybercrime unit detectives, supported by local officers, have looked at these incidents and it is not believed there is any genuine threat\". The investigation put forward resulted in the arrest of George on 19 March, he was later released under investigation.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43457548] BBC News Article \"School bomb threats: Disgruntled Minecraft gamer 'behind hoax'\"</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, George was rearrested after carrying out another hoax, this time targeting a United Airlines flight from the UK to San Francisco.
