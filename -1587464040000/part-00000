This may explain that many scholars yield to the temptation to recog\u00adnize a number of distinct layers and, consequently,  try to identify elements belonging to them.

The dating of these works is historically complicated since they each internally present themselves as composite works compiled by several editors.  All past scholarship on their dating has been evaluated by Meulenbeld in volumes IA and IB of his ''History of Indian Medical Literature''.<ref name=\"HIML-intro\" />  After considering the evidence and arguments concerning the ''Su\u015brutasa\u1e43hit\u0101'', Meulenbeld states (IA, 348), \"The ''Su\u015brutasa\u1e43hit\u0101'' is most probably the work of an unknown author who drew much of the material he incorporated in his treatise from a multiplicity of  earlier sources from various periods. This may explain that many scholars yield to the temptation to recog\u00adnize a number of distinct layers and, consequently,  try to identify elements belonging to them. As we have seen, the identification of features thought to belong to a particu\u00adlar stratum is in many cases determined by preconceived ideas on the age of the strata and their supposed authors.\"  The dating of this work to 600 BC was first proposed by Hoernle over a century ago,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hoernle|first=A.

In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had intentionally assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee investigation from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019.

In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had intentionally assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee investigation from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019.

Lyrics include themes of patriotism, Nepali virtues, unity, love and nationalism. There is a lot of variety in the music of 1974&nbsp;AD. They have successfully tried various genres of music. Their songs, like \"Nepali,\" \"Sambodhan,\" \"Pahilo Junima,\" \"Parelima,\" \"Samjhi Baschu\" and \"Chudaina Timro Mayale\" and others, were some of the biggest hits in Nepalese music. The song \"Nepali Ho\" from their highest selling album Satabdi has been received as the most patriotic commercial song till date.\n\n== Formation (1994) ==\n\nThe group was formed during the 90s by a group of teachers from Gyanodaya School in [[Lalitpur, Nepal]]. The founding members were guitarist [[Phiroj Shyangden (Nepali Musician)|Phiroj Shyangden]], bassist Nirakar Yakthumba and drummer Bhanu A. During the early days the band played various genres for music like hard rock, heavy metal, rock and blues. Drummer Bhanu A was influenced by blues music. When they played cover tunes he sang Gary Moore numbers like \"Walking by Myself\". They played several gigs in and around Kathmandu where they covered numbers by Bryan Adams, Deep Purple and other rock groups. He is also a good guitarist and his bluesy rock style has inspired many guitarists in Nepal. His style has the flavor of guitarists like Gary Moore, Ritchie Blackmore and Eddie Van Halen. They mainly performed their own compositions. The hit tune is \"Mayaluleh\" from their debut album \"Time Out\", established 1974 AD as a household name. During this time, future members [[Adrian Pradhan]] and Sanjay Shreshta were involved with their own bands. Adrian used to be in a hard rock band from [[Kalimpong]] called \"The Flame\".\n\n\"The Flame\" held their first concert in Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu during the winter of 1994. They were basically a cover band doing songs from Iron Maiden, Metallica, Extreme, and other rock acts. Adrian Pradhan played rhythm guitar and performed vocals. The influence of early heavy metal can be heard in Adrian's singing style. Later during the late 90s Adrian joined 1974&nbsp;AD as their drummer/vocalist after former drummer Bhanu A went on hiatus. Percussionist Sanjay Shrestha, who used to play the drums for the St Xavier's school band, was involved with Nepali fusion rock act Shristi.\n\nFlute maestro Manoj Singh would soon join 1974&nbsp;AD and enjoy the popularity of the highly successful band and also contribute to the diversity of sound in the band.  During the late 90s local guitar enthusiast Manoj K.C from Dhobighat, Lalitpur joined 1974&nbsp;AD, completing the lineup.  Together they would form a solid act and go on to conquer the hearts of millions of die-hard fans.\n\n== Fame and fortune ==\n\nThe band was very popular in the Kathmandu and Lalitpur rock scene in mid 90s even before they started churning out big hits like \"Mayalule\" and other tunes. But the release of their debut album established them as a household name in Nepali music. Their compositions which includes \nlyrics on patriotism, self pride as a Nepali and love and unity amongst Nepali people are big hits in Nepali pop culture. They have come up with songs that has helped the nation unite and \nexpress the mutual feelings at times of big changes in country as in the form of political and other big events. The songs can be melodic but at the same time very dark with the lyrics and message it carries. The music covers various genres like heavy metal, hard rock, blues, reggae and funk/soul.\n\n== Post Phiroj 1974AD (2008\u20132012) ==\n\nWhile Manose Singh continues to contribute to the bands newer compositions, given his other musical commitment, Phiroj Shyangden has now exited the band for personal reasons. Not surprisingly, many fans feel a loss, some more than others, in the sound and image of the band. But the band, now with Adrian on vocals and Sanjay on drums, continues to find newer sound. Their new album 8:18 (aath:athara) has been received well by the audience. Numbers like Timi Bina, Bardaan and Rain Song from the album emerged to become winner. However, exit of Phiroj Shyangnden, one of the key members of the band and also the most influential guitarist in Nepal was something that severely hit the band's latest album.\n\n== Back with Phiroj 1974AD (2010-2012)==\n\nDuring their historic US tour of 2012, the band reunited with Phiroj for a few songs in their New York concert on April 21, 2012.  After the successful reunion and with the help of the organizer, Karma Tenzing the band decided to collaborate again for their next show in Baltimore, scheduled 2 weeks after.  Band members Nirakar and Sanjay stated in Nepali that Phiroj had \"never left 1974 AD to begin with.  He always was and still is a part of them\".  They confirmed to various media outlets that the band had reunited again.  In the winter of 2012, Phiroj returned to Nepal and performed in more concerts at St. Xavier's and in various Nepalese cities with the band.  The band even recorded a few songs for their next album.  Phiroj is now back in New York and according to him, the album release would coincide with the band's 20th anniversary in 2014. The album was cancelled and after the tour theywent on a 6-year long hiatus from recording songs\n\n== #thenewlineup and 9th Album (2016-2019) ==\n\nAfter six years of inactivity, 1974AD emerged with new faces to record a new studio album. Adrian and Phiroj left the band for personal reasons, and were replaced by singer Rohit John Chettri and pianist Prajjwal Mukhiya. Additionally, the band added a new horn section with Jacko Wacko and Pratik Baniya in trumpet and trombone, respectively. They recorded their new album, Hazaar Sapana and went on a US tour and on the WAVE 'Rock The Nation' Tour to promote the album. The album became a commercial success relative to others in the music industry of Nepal. Shortly after the release of the album, the band released a song titled, 'Pirai Pir', recounting the stories of the people who suffered during the massive 2015 earthquake, and describing how they could rise up from the loss. The band is currently on tour promoting the new songs.\n\n== Nirantarta - 1974ad Reunion with original members (2019-present) ==\n\nIn an event titled \u2018Nirantarta\u2019, held at Moksh, Jhamshikhel, Kathmandu, Nepal, on 8 July 2019, the band announced the reunion<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/69206/|title=Original 1974AD members reunite|last=Poudel|first=Rahat|website=My City|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref> with their original lineup, Phiroj Shyangden, Adrian Pradhan, Manoj Kumar KC, Nirakar Yakthumba and Sanjay Shrestha.

Lyrics include themes of patriotism, Nepali virtues, unity, love and nationalism. There is a lot of variety in the music of 1974&nbsp;AD. They have successfully tried various genres of music. Their songs, like \"Nepali,\" \"Sambodhan,\" \"Pahilo Junima,\" \"Parelima,\" \"Samjhi Baschu\" and \"Chudaina Timro Mayale\" and others, were some of the biggest hits in Nepalese music. The song \"Nepali Ho\" from their highest selling album Satabdi has been received as the most patriotic commercial song till date.\n\n== Formation (1994) ==\n\nThe group was formed during the 90s by a group of teachers from Gyanodaya School in [[Lalitpur, Nepal]]. The founding members were guitarist [[Phiroj Shyangden (Nepali Musician)|Phiroj Shyangden]], bassist Nirakar Yakthumba and drummer Bhanu A. During the early days the band played various genres for music like hard rock, heavy metal, rock and blues. Drummer Bhanu A was influenced by blues music. When they played cover tunes he sang Gary Moore numbers like \"Walking by Myself\". They played several gigs in and around Kathmandu where they covered numbers by Bryan Adams, Deep Purple and other rock groups. He is also a good guitarist and his bluesy rock style has inspired many guitarists in Nepal. His style has the flavor of guitarists like Gary Moore, Ritchie Blackmore and Eddie Van Halen. They mainly performed their own compositions. The hit tune is \"Mayaluleh\" from their debut album \"Time Out\", established 1974 AD as a household name. During this time, future members [[Adrian Pradhan]] and Sanjay Shreshta were involved with their own bands. Adrian used to be in a hard rock band from [[Kalimpong]] called \"The Flame\".\n\n\"The Flame\" held their first concert in Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu during the winter of 1994. They were basically a cover band doing songs from Iron Maiden, Metallica, Extreme, and other rock acts. Adrian Pradhan played rhythm guitar and performed vocals. The influence of early heavy metal can be heard in Adrian's singing style. Later during the late 90s Adrian joined 1974&nbsp;AD as their drummer/vocalist after former drummer Bhanu A went on hiatus. Percussionist Sanjay Shrestha, who used to play the drums for the St Xavier's school band, was involved with Nepali fusion rock act Shristi.\n\nFlute maestro Manoj Singh would soon join 1974&nbsp;AD and enjoy the popularity of the highly successful band and also contribute to the diversity of sound in the band.  During the late 90s local guitar enthusiast Manoj K.C from Dhobighat, Lalitpur joined 1974&nbsp;AD, completing the lineup.  Together they would form a solid act and go on to conquer the hearts of millions of die-hard fans.\n\n== Fame and fortune ==\n\nThe band was very popular in the Kathmandu and Lalitpur rock scene in mid 90s even before they started churning out big hits like \"Mayalule\" and other tunes. But the release of their debut album established them as a household name in Nepali music. Their compositions which includes \nlyrics on patriotism, self pride as a Nepali and love and unity amongst Nepali people are big hits in Nepali pop culture. They have come up with songs that has helped the nation unite and \nexpress the mutual feelings at times of big changes in country as in the form of political and other big events. The songs can be melodic but at the same time very dark with the lyrics and message it carries. The music covers various genres like heavy metal, hard rock, blues, reggae and funk/soul.\n\n== Post Phiroj 1974AD (2008\u20132012) ==\n\nWhile Manose Singh continues to contribute to the bands newer compositions, given his other musical commitment, Phiroj Shyangden has now exited the band for personal reasons. Not surprisingly, many fans feel a loss, some more than others, in the sound and image of the band. But the band, now with Adrian on vocals and Sanjay on drums, continues to find newer sound. Their new album 8:18 (aath:athara) has been received well by the audience. Numbers like Timi Bina, Bardaan and Rain Song from the album emerged to become winner. However, exit of Phiroj Shyangnden, one of the key members of the band and also the most influential guitarist in Nepal was something that severely hit the band's latest album.\n\n== Back with Phiroj 1974AD (2010-2012)==\n\nDuring their historic US tour of 2012, the band reunited with Phiroj for a few songs in their New York concert on April 21, 2012.  After the successful reunion and with the help of the organizer, Karma Tenzing the band decided to collaborate again for their next show in Baltimore, scheduled 2 weeks after.  Band members Nirakar and Sanjay stated in Nepali that Phiroj had \"never left 1974 AD to begin with.  He always was and still is a part of them\".  They confirmed to various media outlets that the band had reunited again.  In the winter of 2012, Phiroj returned to Nepal and performed in more concerts at St. Xavier's and in various Nepalese cities with the band.  The band even recorded a few songs for their next album.  Phiroj is now back in New York and according to him, the album release would coincide with the band's 20th anniversary in 2014. The album was cancelled and after the tour theywent on a 6-year long hiatus from recording songs\n\n== #thenewlineup and 9th Album (2016-2019) ==\n\nAfter six years of inactivity, 1974AD emerged with new faces to record a new studio album. Adrian and Phiroj left the band for personal reasons, and were replaced by singer Rohit John Chettri and pianist Prajjwal Mukhiya. Additionally, the band added a new horn section with Jacko Wacko and Pratik Baniya in trumpet and trombone, respectively. They recorded their new album, Hazaar Sapana and went on a US tour and on the WAVE 'Rock The Nation' Tour to promote the album. The album became a commercial success relative to others in the music industry of Nepal. Shortly after the release of the album, the band released a song titled, 'Pirai Pir', recounting the stories of the people who suffered during the massive 2015 earthquake, and describing how they could rise up from the loss. The band is currently on tour promoting the new songs.\n\n== Nirantarta - 1974ad Reunion with original members (2019-present) ==\n\nIn an event titled \u2018Nirantarta\u2019, held at Moksh, Jhamshikhel, Kathmandu, Nepal, on 8 July 2019, the band announced the reunion<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/69206/|title=Original 1974AD members reunite|last=Poudel|first=Rahat|website=My City|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref> with their original lineup, Phiroj Shyangden, Adrian Pradhan, Manoj Kumar KC, Nirakar Yakthumba and Sanjay Shrestha.

[[Mustafa the Poet]], Mo-G, [[Safe (rapper)|Safe]] and [[Smoke Dawg]].\n\n==Background==\n===2010-2017===\nAlthough initially the group is said to have stemmed out from a gang participating in criminal activity with the rivalry between Toronto gang Sick Thugz which ended with the passing of Sick Thugz member Ruck.

The degree-awarding authorities approved by the [[Government of Ireland]], which can grant awards at all academic levels, are [[University of Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland]] ([[University College Cork|Cork]], [[University College Dublin|Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Galway]] and [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|Maynooth]]), [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]], [[Dublin City University]], [[Technological University Dublin]], [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]], [[St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]] (Pontifical University),<ref>''Final report on alignment of St. Patrick\u2019s College, Maynooth awards made in Ireland to the National Framework of Qualifications'' www.nqai.ie, September 2011.</ref>  and [[University of Limerick]].  The [[King's Inns]] of [[Dublin]] has a limited role in education specialising in the preparation of candidates for the degree of [[barrister|barrister-at-law]] to practice as barristers. [[Medical school#Ireland|Medical schools in Ireland]] also have particular regulation. There were seven establishments of higher education within the [[Republic of Ireland]] ranked among the top 500 universities worldwide by the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' in 2008.<ref>[http://www.topuniversities.com/worlduniversityrankings/results/2008/overall_rankings/fullrankings/ Times Higher Education Supplement Top 500 Universities Worldwide 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720004138/http://www.topuniversities.com/worlduniversityrankings/results/2008/overall_rankings/fullrankings/ |date=20 July 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.prospectus.ie/documents/5037662Irish%20Times%20Edu%20Article_8.1.07.pdf Ireland faces a university challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004072302/http://www.prospectus.ie/documents/5037662Irish%20Times%20Edu%20Article_8.1.07.pdf |date=4 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Framework==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The latter include the [[Institutes of Technology in Ireland|Institutes of Technology]], Colleges of Education, and other independent colleges. Some colleges have \"delegated authority\" from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, this allows them to confer and validate awards in their own name.\n\nSome institutions such as the [[University of Limerick]], [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] (DIT), and [[Dublin City University]] (DCU) have completed a process of modularising their courses (others are still in a transition phase), mostly using the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]. The [[Bologna process]] and [[applied research]] are the current concerns of national educational policy, additional concerns include the structures of the [[National University of Ireland]] and [[Trinity College Dublin]]. Since the mid-2000s, a number of Institutes of Technology have applied for university designation, including DIT, Cork, and Waterford.\n\nThe ''Marks & Standards'' document, offered by most institutions, can be consulted for information on the range and criteria set down for awards, while programme specifications offer additional information. In contrast to practice in the rest of the education system, entry tends to be highly competitive for [[High school graduate|school leavers]]; the so-called \"Points Race\" administered by the [[Central Applications Office]] (CAO). In 2001 the percentage of school leavers transferring to third level exceeded 50% for the first time, as of 2005 it is in excess of 55% and expected to grow at approximately 1% per annum for the next decade.\n\nThere are over 25 third-level courses at graduate and postgraduate level offered through the Irish language. ''[[Acadamh na hOllscola\u00edochta Gaeilge]]'' is the Irish language Department of the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] (NUI Galway) and it has different off-campus centres throughout the Gaeltacht regions. Dublin City University has an Irish language department called Fiontar. [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), DIT, and [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology]] (GMIT) also offer similar courses.\n\nAll but two of the seven universities in the [[Republic of Ireland]] offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees through the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]] where the student can choose their specialisation after their first year of study. The two universities that do not offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) arts degrees, Trinity College Dublin and DCU, do still offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in specific areas of study such as [[Drama|Drama Studies]], [[Journalism]], [[Latin]], [[History]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[International Relations]].\n\nIn one, Trinity College Dublin, the applicants wishing to read an Arts degree may apply to the college to read a combination of two subjects, such as French and Philosophy - which the student may continue to read jointly or with focus on one. DCU's de facto omnibus entry arts degree is offered by [[St. Patrick's College of Education (Drumcondra)|St. Patrick's College of Education]] (a college of DCU) and is titled \"[[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Humanities\". [[All Hallows College]] (a college of DCU) offer BA in Humanities, Theology Pastoral Care, and English.\n\nEntry into higher education institutions is normally done through the CAO. In this way, students wishing to enter university apply to the CAO rather than the individual university. Places in courses are usually awarded based on results in the Leaving Certificate Examination or any international equivalent. Each university has a minimum entry requirement, usually requiring a pass grade in either English or Irish, as well as maths. Some also require a pass grade in a modern continental European language (French, German, Spanish or Italian). Each individual course has further entry requirements, for example, science courses usually require a certain grade in one or two sciences. The student must also achieve the number of points required for the course under the points system. However, universities also have systems in place for accepting mature students, and students who have successfully completed a Post Leaving Certificate or Further Education course.\n\nEntry into third-level is generally very high in the Republic of Ireland (as it also is in [[Northern Ireland]]), and among young adults (those aged 25 to 34), 41.6% of them have attained third-level degrees\u2014the second highest level in the EU after Cyprus, and substantially ahead of the average of 29.1%.<ref name=\"Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007\">[http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/other_releases/2007/progress2007/measuringirelandsprogress.pdf Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007]</ref> Broken down by gender, approximately 43% of women and 40% of men Ireland attend third level education. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|title=Census of Population 2016 \u2013 Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language - CSO - Central Statistics Office|language=en|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref>\n\n===Fees===\n\nUnder the \"Free Fees Initiative\" the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Government]] will pay the [[tuition]] fees of students who meet relevant course, nationality and residence requirements as set down under the initiative. These requirements include:<ref name=\"studentfinance.ie\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9386/undergraduate-courses-of-not-less-than-two-years-duration-in-colleges-in-list-1/index.html\n |title       = Undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration in colleges in List 1\n |accessdate  = 2010-02-24\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100125031716/http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9386/undergraduate-courses-of-not-less-than-two-years-duration-in-colleges-in-list-1/index.html\n |archivedate = 25 January 2010\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} Student Finance.ie, information for Undergradute students</ref>\n\n* Holding EU nationality, or are a national of member country of the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]], or those who have been granted official [[refugee]] status.\n* Having been a resident in an EU Member State for at least three of the five years preceding entry to the course.\n* Are not undertaking a second undergraduate course.\n\nStudents are required to pay a \"registration fee\" on entry to their courses. These charges cover costs such as equipment usage, administration fees and exam fees. Charges for 2008/09 were on average \u20ac850 per student, but was raised to \u20ac1,500 per student for the 2009/10 school year.<ref name=\"Fees FAQ\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.ucd.ie/registry/adminservices/fees/faq.html\n |title=Fees FAQ \n |accessdate=2010-02-24}} University College Dublin, Administrative Services - Fees & Grants</ref> These charges have been labelled as \"unofficial fees\", and University Heads have admitted that \"student registration charges are fees by any other name\".<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.independent.ie/education/latest-news/universities-admit-student-charge-is-an-unofficial-fee-2038465.html\n |title=Universities admit student charge is an unofficial fee\n |accessdate=2010-02-24\n | work=Irish Independent\n |date=29 January 2010}} Independent.ie - Universities admit student charge is an unofficial fee</ref>\nIn 2011, after large annual increases, the Registration Fee was abolished and replaced with a Student Contribution. For the school year 2019/2020 this fee stands at \u20ac3,000.\n\n==Further education==\n{{see also|List of further education colleges in the Republic of Ireland}}\nFurther education is vocational and technical education and training in post-compulsory education. Awards are offered by a multitude of bodies, both ad-hoc and statutory. Typical areas included [[apprenticeship]]s, childcare, farming, retail, and tourism. These are typical areas of the economy that do not depend on multinational investment and recognition. There are many different types of further education awards, known as [[Post Leaving Certificate]]s.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/alternative-career-routes-boost-options-for-school-leavers-1.3972995\n | title =Alternative career routes boost options for school-leavers\n | last =Mooney\n | first =Brian\n | date =17 August 2019\n | website =Irish Times\n | access-date =17 August 2019\n | quote =Practical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside the traditional CAO system. }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Further Education and Training Awards Council]] conferred awards in the extra-university system. Further education has expanded immensely in recent years helped by the institutions, and because of this the type and range of these awards have been formalized to restore confidence. There are two separate schemes enabling progression for holders of FETAC awards to Universities and Institutes of Technology. FETAC awards carried points that can be used to access higher education. FETAC was dissolved and its functions were passed to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on 6 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web| title=Minister Quinn merges educational agencies to establish QQI | url=http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2012-Press-Releases/PR2012-11-06.html|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Increase in third-level degrees==\nIreland has a higher proportion of third-level graduates than any other EU country, although many third-level students are better suited to further education and training. At the same time, the proportion of graduates with first-class honours has reached record levels, particularly in institutes of technology. It is unclear whether this increase is due to [[grade inflation]] or increased motivation of students. Whatever the reason, employers increasingly examine graduates' extracurricular activities and work experiences as they search for the most able applicants.<ref>{{cite web\n | url

The degree-awarding authorities approved by the [[Government of Ireland]], which can grant awards at all academic levels, are [[University of Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland]] ([[University College Cork|Cork]], [[University College Dublin|Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Galway]] and [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|Maynooth]]), [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]], [[Dublin City University]], [[Technological University Dublin]], [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]], [[St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]] (Pontifical University),<ref>''Final report on alignment of St. Patrick\u2019s College, Maynooth awards made in Ireland to the National Framework of Qualifications'' www.nqai.ie, September 2011.</ref>  and [[University of Limerick]].  The [[King's Inns]] of [[Dublin]] has a limited role in education specialising in the preparation of candidates for the degree of [[barrister|barrister-at-law]] to practice as barristers. [[Medical school#Ireland|Medical schools in Ireland]] also have particular regulation.

The latter include the [[Institutes of Technology in Ireland|Institutes of Technology]], Colleges of Education, and other independent colleges. Some colleges have \"delegated authority\" from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, this allows them to confer and validate awards in their own name.\n\nSome institutions such as the [[University of Limerick]], [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] (DIT), and [[Dublin City University]] (DCU) have completed a process of modularising their courses (others are still in a transition phase), mostly using the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]. The [[Bologna process]] and [[applied research]] are the current concerns of national educational policy, additional concerns include the structures of the [[National University of Ireland]] and [[Trinity College Dublin]]. Since the mid-2000s, a number of Institutes of Technology have applied for university designation, including DIT, Cork, and Waterford.\n\nThe ''Marks & Standards'' document, offered by most institutions, can be consulted for information on the range and criteria set down for awards, while programme specifications offer additional information. In contrast to practice in the rest of the education system, entry tends to be highly competitive for [[High school graduate|school leavers]]; the so-called \"Points Race\" administered by the [[Central Applications Office]] (CAO). In 2001 the percentage of school leavers transferring to third level exceeded 50% for the first time, as of 2005 it is in excess of 55% and expected to grow at approximately 1% per annum for the next decade.\n\nThere are over 25 third-level courses at graduate and postgraduate level offered through the Irish language. ''[[Acadamh na hOllscola\u00edochta Gaeilge]]'' is the Irish language Department of the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] (NUI Galway) and it has different off-campus centres throughout the Gaeltacht regions. Dublin City University has an Irish language department called Fiontar. [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), DIT, and [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology]] (GMIT) also offer similar courses.\n\nAll but two of the seven universities in the [[Republic of Ireland]] offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees through the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]] where the student can choose their specialisation after their first year of study. The two universities that do not offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) arts degrees, Trinity College Dublin and DCU, do still offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in specific areas of study such as [[Drama|Drama Studies]], [[Journalism]], [[Latin]], [[History]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[International Relations]].\n\nIn one, Trinity College Dublin, the applicants wishing to read an Arts degree may apply to the college to read a combination of two subjects, such as French and Philosophy - which the student may continue to read jointly or with focus on one. DCU's de facto omnibus entry arts degree is offered by [[St. Patrick's College of Education (Drumcondra)|St. Patrick's College of Education]] (a college of DCU) and is titled \"[[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Humanities\". [[All Hallows College]] (a college of DCU) offer BA in Humanities, Theology Pastoral Care, and English.\n\nEntry into higher education institutions is normally done through the CAO. In this way, students wishing to enter university apply to the CAO rather than the individual university. Places in courses are usually awarded based on results in the Leaving Certificate Examination or any international equivalent. Each university has a minimum entry requirement, usually requiring a pass grade in either English or Irish, as well as maths. Some also require a pass grade in a modern continental European language (French, German, Spanish or Italian). Each individual course has further entry requirements, for example, science courses usually require a certain grade in one or two sciences. The student must also achieve the number of points required for the course under the points system. However, universities also have systems in place for accepting mature students, and students who have successfully completed a Post Leaving Certificate or Further Education course.\n\nEntry into third-level is generally very high in the Republic of Ireland (as it also is in [[Northern Ireland]]), and among young adults (those aged 25 to 34), 41.6% of them have attained third-level degrees\u2014the second highest level in the EU after Cyprus, and substantially ahead of the average of 29.1%.<ref name=\"Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007\">[http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/other_releases/2007/progress2007/measuringirelandsprogress.pdf Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007]</ref> Broken down by gender, approximately 43% of women and 40% of men Ireland attend third level education. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|title=Census of Population 2016 \u2013 Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language - CSO - Central Statistics Office|language=en|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref>\n\n===Fees===\n\nUnder the \"Free Fees Initiative\" the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Government]] will pay the [[tuition]] fees of students who meet relevant course, nationality and residence requirements as set down under the initiative. These requirements include:<ref name=\"studentfinance.ie\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9386/undergraduate-courses-of-not-less-than-two-years-duration-in-colleges-in-list-1/index.html\n |title       = Undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration in colleges in List 1\n |accessdate  = 2010-02-24\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100125031716/http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9386/undergraduate-courses-of-not-less-than-two-years-duration-in-colleges-in-list-1/index.html\n |archivedate = 25 January 2010\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} Student Finance.ie, information for Undergradute students</ref>\n\n* Holding EU nationality, or are a national of member country of the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]], or those who have been granted official [[refugee]] status.\n* Having been a resident in an EU Member State for at least three of the five years preceding entry to the course.\n* Are not undertaking a second undergraduate course.\n\nStudents are required to pay a \"registration fee\" on entry to their courses. These charges cover costs such as equipment usage, administration fees and exam fees. Charges for 2008/09 were on average \u20ac850 per student, but was raised to \u20ac1,500 per student for the 2009/10 school year.<ref name=\"Fees FAQ\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.ucd.ie/registry/adminservices/fees/faq.html\n |title=Fees FAQ \n |accessdate=2010-02-24}} University College Dublin, Administrative Services - Fees & Grants</ref> These charges have been labelled as \"unofficial fees\", and University Heads have admitted that \"student registration charges are fees by any other name\".<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.independent.ie/education/latest-news/universities-admit-student-charge-is-an-unofficial-fee-2038465.html\n |title=Universities admit student charge is an unofficial fee\n |accessdate=2010-02-24\n | work=Irish Independent\n |date=29 January 2010}} Independent.ie - Universities admit student charge is an unofficial fee</ref>\nIn 2011, after large annual increases, the Registration Fee was abolished and replaced with a Student Contribution. For the school year 2019/2020 this fee stands at \u20ac3,000.\n\n==Further education==\n{{see also|List of further education colleges in the Republic of Ireland}}\nFurther education is vocational and technical education and training in post-compulsory education. Awards are offered by a multitude of bodies, both ad-hoc and statutory. Typical areas included [[apprenticeship]]s, childcare, farming, retail, and tourism. These are typical areas of the economy that do not depend on multinational investment and recognition. There are many different types of further education awards, known as [[Post Leaving Certificate]]s.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/alternative-career-routes-boost-options-for-school-leavers-1.3972995\n | title =Alternative career routes boost options for school-leavers\n | last =Mooney\n | first =Brian\n | date =17 August 2019\n | website =Irish Times\n | access-date =17 August 2019\n | quote =Practical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside the traditional CAO system. }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Further Education and Training Awards Council]] conferred awards in the extra-university system. Further education has expanded immensely in recent years helped by the institutions, and because of this the type and range of these awards have been formalized to restore confidence. There are two separate schemes enabling progression for holders of FETAC awards to Universities and Institutes of Technology. FETAC awards carried points that can be used to access higher education. FETAC was dissolved and its functions were passed to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on 6 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web| title=Minister Quinn merges educational agencies to establish QQI | url=http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2012-Press-Releases/PR2012-11-06.html|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Increase in third-level degrees==\nIreland has a higher proportion of third-level graduates than any other EU country, although many third-level students are better suited to further education and training. At the same time, the proportion of graduates with first-class honours has reached record levels, particularly in institutes of technology. It is unclear whether this increase is due to [[grade inflation]] or increased motivation of students. Whatever the reason, employers increasingly examine graduates' extracurricular activities and work experiences as they search for the most able applicants.<ref>{{cite web\n | url

Henna will not stain skin until the [[lawsone]] molecules are made available (released) from the henna leaves. However, dried henna leaves will stain the skin if they are mashed into a paste. The lawsone will gradually migrate from the henna paste into the outer layer of the skin and bind to the [[protein]]s in it, creating a stain.\n\n[[File:Henna for hair.jpg|thumb|right|Henna powder]]\nSince it is difficult to form intricate patterns from coarsely crushed leaves, henna is commonly traded as a powder<ref>{{cite web|title=Henna Powder of Prem Dulhan|url=http://www.premhenna.com/natural-henna-powder.html|publisher=[[Lia]]| accessdate = December 23, 2015}}</ref> made by drying, [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] and [[Sieve|sifting]] the leaves. The dry powder is mixed with one of a number of liquids, including water, lemon juice, strong tea, and other ingredients, depending on the tradition. Many artists use sugar or molasses in the paste to improve consistency to keep it stuck to the skin better. The henna mix must rest between one and 48 hours before use in order to release the lawsone from the leaf matter. The timing depends on the crop of henna being used. Essential oils with high levels of [[monoterpene]] alcohols, such as [[Melaleuca|tea tree]], [[cajuput]], or [[lavender]], will improve skin stain characteristics. Other essential oils, such as eucalyptus and clove, are also useful but are too irritating and should not be used on the skin.\n\n[[File:Final Mehndi (Henna Tattoo).theora.ogv|thumb|left|Video of henna being applied]]\nThe paste can be applied with many traditional and innovative tools, starting with a basic stick or twig. In Morocco, a syringe is common. A plastic cone similar to those used to pipe icing onto cakes is used in the Indian culture. In the Western world, a cone is common, as is a Jacquard bottle, which is otherwise used to paint silk fabric. A light stain may be achieved within minutes, but the longer the paste is left on the skin, the darker and longer lasting the stain will be, so it needs to be left on as long as possible.  To prevent it from drying or falling off the skin, the paste is often sealed down by dabbing a sugar/lemon mix over the dried paste or adding some form of sugar to the paste.  After time the dry paste is simply brushed or scraped away. The paste should be kept on the skin for a minimum of four to six hours. but longer times and even wearing the paste overnight is a common practice. Removal should not be done with water, as water interferes with the oxidation process of stain development. Cooking oil may be used to loosen dry paste.\n\nHenna stains are orange when the paste is first removed, but darken over the following three days to a deep reddish brown due to oxidation. Soles and palms have the thickest layer of skin and so take up the most lawsone, and take it to the greatest depth, so that hands and feet will have the darkest and most long-lasting stains. Some also believe that steaming or warming the henna pattern will darken the stain, either during the time the paste is still on the skin, or after the paste has been removed. It is debatable whether this adds to the color of the end result as well. After the stain reaches its peak color, it holds for a few days, then gradually wears off by way of [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]], typically within one to three weeks.\n\nNatural henna pastes containing only henna powder, a liquid (water, lemon juice, etc.) and an essential oil (lavender, cajuput, tea tree etc.) are not \"shelf stable,\" meaning they expire quickly, and cannot be left out on a shelf for over one week without losing their ability to stain the skin.\n\n[[File:HNQ.svg|thumb|right|[[Lawsone]], an active compound in henna]]\nThe leaf of the henna plant contains a finite amount of lawsone molecule. As a result, once the powder has been mixed into a paste, this leaching of dye molecule into the mixture will only occur for an average of two to six days. If a paste will not be used within the first few days after mixing, it can be frozen for up to four months to halt the dye release, for thawing and use at a later time. Commercially packaged pastes that remain able to stain the skin longer than seven days without refrigeration or freezing contain other chemicals besides henna that may be dangerous to the skin. After the initial seven-day release of lawsone dye, the henna leaf is spent, therefore any dye created by these commercial cones on the skin after this time period is actually the result of other compounds in the product. These chemicals are often undisclosed on packaging, and have a wide range of colors including what appears to be a natural looking color stain produced by dyes such as sodium picramate. These products often do not contain any henna. There are many adulterated henna pastes such as these, and others, for sale today that are erroneously marketed as \"natural\", \"pure\", or \"organic\", all containing potentially dangerous undisclosed additives. The length of time a pre-manufactured paste takes to arrive in the hands of consumers is typically longer than the seven-day dye release window of henna, therefore one can reasonably expect that any pre-made mass-produced cone that is not shipped frozen is a potentially harmful adulterated chemical variety.\n\nHenna only stains the skin one color, a variation of reddish brown, at full maturity three days after application.\n\nPowdered fresh henna, unlike pre-mixed paste, can be easily shipped all over the world and stored for many years in a well-sealed package.\n\nBody art quality henna is often more finely sifted than henna powders for hair.\n\n===Hair/eyebrow dye===\n====History====\n[[File:Old Punjabi Woman.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Elderly [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] woman whose hair is dyed with henna]]\n[[File:Henna hair colour squares.jpeg|thumb|right|Cosmetic henna for colouring hair]]\nIn Ancient Egypt, [[Ahmose-Henuttamehu]] (17th Dynasty, 1574 BCE): Henuttamehu was probably a daughter of [[Seqenenre Tao]] and [[Ahmose Inhapy]]. Smith reports that the mummy of Henuttamehu's own hair had been dyed a bright red at the sides, probably with henna.<ref>G. Elliott Smith, The Royal Mummies, Duckworth Publishing; (September, 2000)</ref>\n\nIn Europe, henna was popular among women connected to the [[Aestheticism|aesthetic movement]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] artists of England in the 1800s. [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s wife and muse, [[Elizabeth Siddal]], had naturally bright red hair. Contrary to the cultural tradition in Britain that considered red hair unattractive, the Pre-Raphaelites fetishized red hair. Siddal was portrayed by Rossetti in many paintings that emphasized her flowing red hair.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aesthetics|url=http://www.fashion-era.com/aesthetics.htm|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> The other Pre-Raphaelites, including [[Evelyn De Morgan]] and [[Frederick Sandys]], academic classicists such as [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Frederic Leighton]], and French painters such as [[Gaston Bussi\u00e8re]] and the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], further popularized the association of henna-dyed hair and young bohemian women.\n\nOpera singer [[Adelina Patti]] is sometimes credited with popularizing the use of henna in Europe in the late nineteenth century. Parisian courtesan [[Cora Pearl]] was often referred to as La Lune Rousse (the red-haired moon) for dying her hair red. In her memoirs, she relates an incident when she dyed her pet dog's fur to match her own hair.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearl|first=Cora|title=The Memoirs of Cora Pearl|year=2009|publisher=General Books LLC|volume=13|isbn=9781151590527}}</ref> By the 1950s, [[Lucille Ball]] popularized \"henna rinse\" as her character, Lucy Ricardo, called it on the television show ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.

This is considered ''[[sunnah]]'', a commendable tradition of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]. Furthermore, a ''[[hadith]]'' (narration of the Prophet) holds that he encouraged Muslim women to dye their nails with henna to demonstrate femininity and distinguish their hands from those of men. Thus, some Muslim women in the Middle East apply henna to their finger and toenails as well as their hands.\n\n====Today====\nCommercially packaged henna, intended for use as a cosmetic hair dye, is available in many countries and is now popular in [[India]], as well as the Middle East, Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States. The color that results from dyeing with henna depends on the original color of the hair, as well as the quality of the henna, and can range from orange to auburn to burgundy. Henna can be mixed with other natural hair dyes, including ''[[Cassia obovata]]'' for lighter shades of red or even blond and indigo to achieve brown and black shades. Some products sold as \"henna\" include these other natural dyes. Others may include metal salts that can interact with other chemical treatments, or oils and waxes that may inhibit the dye, or dyes which may be allergens.\n\nApart from its use as a hair dye, henna has recently been used as a temporal substitute to eyebrow pencil or even as eyebrow embroidery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instyle.com/news/henna-eyebrow-tinting|title=You Can Now Tint Your Eyebrows With Henna|website=InStyle.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-17}}</ref>\n\n==Traditions of henna as body art==\n<!-- \"Culture of Israel\" links here -->\nThe different words for henna in ancient languages imply that it had more than one point of discovery and origin, as well as different pathways of daily and ceremonial use.\n* It is important to note that the modern term \u201cHenna tattoo\u201d is a marketing term only.

Henna will not stain skin until the [[lawsone]] molecules are made available (released) from the henna leaves. However, dried henna leaves will stain the skin if they are mashed into a paste. The lawsone will gradually migrate from the henna paste into the outer layer of the skin and bind to the [[protein]]s in it, creating a stain.\n\n[[File:Henna for hair.jpg|thumb|right|Henna powder]]\nSince it is difficult to form intricate patterns from coarsely crushed leaves, henna is commonly traded as a powder<ref>{{cite web|title=Henna Powder of Prem Dulhan|url=http://www.premhenna.com/natural-henna-powder.html|publisher=[[Lia]]| accessdate = December 23, 2015}}</ref> made by drying, [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] and [[Sieve|sifting]] the leaves. The dry powder is mixed with one of a number of liquids, including water, lemon juice, strong tea, and other ingredients, depending on the tradition. Many artists use sugar or molasses in the paste to improve consistency to keep it stuck to the skin better. The henna mix must rest between one and 48 hours before use in order to release the lawsone from the leaf matter. The timing depends on the crop of henna being used. Essential oils with high levels of [[monoterpene]] alcohols, such as [[Melaleuca|tea tree]], [[cajuput]], or [[lavender]], will improve skin stain characteristics. Other essential oils, such as eucalyptus and clove, are also useful but are too irritating and should not be used on the skin.\n\n[[File:Final Mehndi (Henna Tattoo).theora.ogv|thumb|left|Video of henna being applied]]\nThe paste can be applied with many traditional and innovative tools, starting with a basic stick or twig. In Morocco, a syringe is common. A plastic cone similar to those used to pipe icing onto cakes is used in the Indian culture. In the Western world, a cone is common, as is a Jacquard bottle, which is otherwise used to paint silk fabric. A light stain may be achieved within minutes, but the longer the paste is left on the skin, the darker and longer lasting the stain will be, so it needs to be left on as long as possible.  To prevent it from drying or falling off the skin, the paste is often sealed down by dabbing a sugar/lemon mix over the dried paste or adding some form of sugar to the paste.  After time the dry paste is simply brushed or scraped away. The paste should be kept on the skin for a minimum of four to six hours. but longer times and even wearing the paste overnight is a common practice. Removal should not be done with water, as water interferes with the oxidation process of stain development. Cooking oil may be used to loosen dry paste.\n\nHenna stains are orange when the paste is first removed, but darken over the following three days to a deep reddish brown due to oxidation. Soles and palms have the thickest layer of skin and so take up the most lawsone, and take it to the greatest depth, so that hands and feet will have the darkest and most long-lasting stains. Some also believe that steaming or warming the henna pattern will darken the stain, either during the time the paste is still on the skin, or after the paste has been removed. It is debatable whether this adds to the color of the end result as well. After the stain reaches its peak color, it holds for a few days, then gradually wears off by way of [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]], typically within one to three weeks.\n\nNatural henna pastes containing only henna powder, a liquid (water, lemon juice, etc.) and an essential oil (lavender, cajuput, tea tree etc.) are not \"shelf stable,\" meaning they expire quickly, and cannot be left out on a shelf for over one week without losing their ability to stain the skin.\n\n[[File:HNQ.svg|thumb|right|[[Lawsone]], an active compound in henna]]\nThe leaf of the henna plant contains a finite amount of lawsone molecule. As a result, once the powder has been mixed into a paste, this leaching of dye molecule into the mixture will only occur for an average of two to six days. If a paste will not be used within the first few days after mixing, it can be frozen for up to four months to halt the dye release, for thawing and use at a later time. Commercially packaged pastes that remain able to stain the skin longer than seven days without refrigeration or freezing contain other chemicals besides henna that may be dangerous to the skin. After the initial seven-day release of lawsone dye, the henna leaf is spent, therefore any dye created by these commercial cones on the skin after this time period is actually the result of other compounds in the product. These chemicals are often undisclosed on packaging, and have a wide range of colors including what appears to be a natural looking color stain produced by dyes such as sodium picramate. These products often do not contain any henna. There are many adulterated henna pastes such as these, and others, for sale today that are erroneously marketed as \"natural\", \"pure\", or \"organic\", all containing potentially dangerous undisclosed additives. The length of time a pre-manufactured paste takes to arrive in the hands of consumers is typically longer than the seven-day dye release window of henna, therefore one can reasonably expect that any pre-made mass-produced cone that is not shipped frozen is a potentially harmful adulterated chemical variety.\n\nHenna only stains the skin one color, a variation of reddish brown, at full maturity three days after application.\n\nPowdered fresh henna, unlike pre-mixed paste, can be easily shipped all over the world and stored for many years in a well-sealed package.\n\nBody art quality henna is often more finely sifted than henna powders for hair.\n\n===Hair/eyebrow dye===\n====History====\n[[File:Old Punjabi Woman.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Elderly [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] woman whose hair is dyed with henna]]\n[[File:Henna hair colour squares.jpeg|thumb|right|Cosmetic henna for colouring hair]]\nIn Ancient Egypt, [[Ahmose-Henuttamehu]] (17th Dynasty, 1574 BCE): Henuttamehu was probably a daughter of [[Seqenenre Tao]] and [[Ahmose Inhapy]]. Smith reports that the mummy of Henuttamehu's own hair had been dyed a bright red at the sides, probably with henna.<ref>G. Elliott Smith, The Royal Mummies, Duckworth Publishing; (September, 2000)</ref>\n\nIn Europe, henna was popular among women connected to the [[Aestheticism|aesthetic movement]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] artists of England in the 1800s. [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s wife and muse, [[Elizabeth Siddal]], had naturally bright red hair. Contrary to the cultural tradition in Britain that considered red hair unattractive, the Pre-Raphaelites fetishized red hair. Siddal was portrayed by Rossetti in many paintings that emphasized her flowing red hair.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aesthetics|url=http://www.fashion-era.com/aesthetics.htm|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> The other Pre-Raphaelites, including [[Evelyn De Morgan]] and [[Frederick Sandys]], academic classicists such as [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Frederic Leighton]], and French painters such as [[Gaston Bussi\u00e8re]] and the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], further popularized the association of henna-dyed hair and young bohemian women.\n\nOpera singer [[Adelina Patti]] is sometimes credited with popularizing the use of henna in Europe in the late nineteenth century. Parisian courtesan [[Cora Pearl]] was often referred to as La Lune Rousse (the red-haired moon) for dying her hair red. In her memoirs, she relates an incident when she dyed her pet dog's fur to match her own hair.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearl|first=Cora|title=The Memoirs of Cora Pearl|year=2009|publisher=General Books LLC|volume=13|isbn=9781151590527}}</ref> By the 1950s, [[Lucille Ball]] popularized \"henna rinse\" as her character, Lucy Ricardo, called it on the television show ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.

This is considered ''[[sunnah]]'', a commendable tradition of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]. Furthermore, a ''[[hadith]]'' (narration of the Prophet) holds that he encouraged Muslim women to dye their nails with henna to demonstrate femininity and distinguish their hands from those of men. Thus, some Muslim women in the Middle East apply henna to their finger and toenails as well as their hands.\n\n====Today====\nCommercially packaged henna, intended for use as a cosmetic hair dye, is available in many countries and is now popular in [[India]], as well as the Middle East, Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States. The color that results from dyeing with henna depends on the original color of the hair, as well as the quality of the henna, and can range from orange to auburn to burgundy. Henna can be mixed with other natural hair dyes, including ''[[Cassia obovata]]'' for lighter shades of red or even blond and indigo to achieve brown and black shades. Some products sold as \"henna\" include these other natural dyes. Others may include metal salts that can interact with other chemical treatments, or oils and waxes that may inhibit the dye, or dyes which may be allergens.\n\nApart from its use as a hair dye, henna has recently been used as a temporal substitute to eyebrow pencil or even as eyebrow embroidery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instyle.com/news/henna-eyebrow-tinting|title=You Can Now Tint Your Eyebrows With Henna|website=InStyle.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-17}}</ref>\n\n==Traditions of henna as body art==\n<!-- \"Culture of Israel\" links here -->\nThe different words for henna in ancient languages imply that it had more than one point of discovery and origin, as well as different pathways of daily and ceremonial use.\n* It is important to note that the modern term \u201cHenna tattoo\u201d is a marketing term only.
