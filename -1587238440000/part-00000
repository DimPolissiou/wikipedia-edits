Its land area is only {{convert|9.8|km2|sqmi}}, but that encloses a lagoon of {{convert|972|km2|sqmi}}. It is located {{convert|18|km|mi}} north of the atoll of [[Aur Atoll|Aur]]. In 2011 the population of the islands of the atoll was 682.\n\nThe largest of the islands that make up the atoll are [[Taroa]] (the administrative center of the atoll), in the northeast, and [[Kaben]] in the northwest. Only three of the other islands in the atoll are inhabited: Airuk, Wolot and Jang. The island is served by [[Air Marshall Islands]] via [[Maloelap Airport]].\n\n==History==\nMaloelap Atoll was claimed by the [[Empire of Germany]] along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1884, and the Germans established a trading outpost. After World War I, the island came under the [[South Pacific Mandate]] of the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\nIn 1939, the Japanese built a seaplane base and landplane [[Taroa Airfield]] with two runways (4800' + 4100') and support buildings and facilities, including a [[radar]] station. During World War II the Japanese garrison of 2,940 navy men and 389 army men was commanded by Rear Admiral Shoichi Kamada.<ref name=Takizawa>{{cite web|first1=Akira |last1=Takizawa |first2=Allan |last2=Alsleben |url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/japan_garrison.html |title=Japanese garrisons on the by-passed Pacific Islands 1944-1945 |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106231303/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/japan_garrison.html |archivedate=2016-01-06 }}</ref> The perimeter of the island was heavily fortified with 12 heavy coastal artillery and 10 heavy anti-aircraft guns.<ref name=Takizawa/> The island was attacked by the [[United States Navy]] beginning in February 1942 starting with carrier-based aircraft and shelling by warships. The attacks grew in frequency and severity after [[Majuro]] and [[Kwajalein]] had fallen to the Americans. Of the 3097-man Japanese garrison (1772 [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], 368 [[Imperial Japanese Army]], and 957 civilians) only 1041 (34%) survived the war. Several Marshallese were also killed.

Its land area is only {{convert|9.8|km2|sqmi}}, but that encloses a lagoon of {{convert|972|km2|sqmi}}. It is located {{convert|18|km|mi}} north of the atoll of [[Aur Atoll|Aur]]. In 2011 the population of the islands of the atoll was 682.\n\nThe largest of the islands that make up the atoll are [[Taroa]] (the administrative center of the atoll), in the northeast, and [[Kaben]] in the northwest. Only three of the other islands in the atoll are inhabited: Airuk, Wolot and Jang. The island is served by [[Air Marshall Islands]] via [[Maloelap Airport]].\n\n==History==\nMaloelap Atoll was claimed by the [[Empire of Germany]] along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1884, and the Germans established a trading outpost. After World War I, the island came under the [[South Pacific Mandate]] of the [[Empire of Japan]]. \n\nIn 1939, the Japanese built a seaplane base and landplane [[Taroa Airfield]] with two runways (4800' + 4100') and support buildings and facilities, including a [[radar]] station. During World War II the Japanese garrison of 2,940 navy men and 389 army men was commanded by Rear Admiral Shoichi Kamada.<ref name=Takizawa>{{cite web|first1=Akira |last1=Takizawa |first2=Allan |last2=Alsleben |url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/japan_garrison.html |title=Japanese garrisons on the by-passed Pacific Islands 1944-1945 |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106231303/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/japan_garrison.html |archivedate=2016-01-06 }}</ref> The perimeter of the island was heavily fortified with 12 heavy coastal artillery and 10 heavy anti-aircraft guns.<ref name=Takizawa/> The island was attacked by the [[United States Navy]] beginning in February 1942 starting with carrier-based aircraft and shelling by warships. The attacks grew in frequency and severity after [[Majuro]] and [[Kwajalein]] had fallen to the Americans. Of the 3097-man Japanese garrison (1772 [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], 368 [[Imperial Japanese Army]], and 957 civilians) only 1041 (34%) survived the war. Several Marshallese were also killed. A large number of war relics, including plane wrecks, mainly [[Mitsubishi A6M]] Zero fighters and [[Mitsubishi G4M]] Betty bombers remain scattered about.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the island came under the control of the United States as part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986.

Jonah Jameson]] plans to shut down Horizon. At the Sinister Six's underwater base, Doctor Octopus tells the Six his master plan. Doctor Octopus activates a giant antennae called the Octahedral which in turn activate his satellites called the Octavian Lens. The Octavian Lens speed up the Greenhouse Effect, raising the Earth's temperature. Hacking into the TV screens around the world, Doctor Octopus announces what is happening and reveals he also has technology to fight global warming. He says he can save the world so that he can be known as the man who \"gave you the greatest gift of all...a future.\" Peter Parker dons a new Spider-Man costume he had prepared in anticipation for the Sinister Six's next attack and meets up with the Avengers, who are discussing how to combat this threat. Spider-Man states that the time to react is now.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #682</ref>\n\nIn a flashback, the Sinister Six are shown stealing objects from around the world to further their plans. In the present at [[Palazzo Senatorio]], an international meeting of the world's greatest minds and the world leaders is held to discuss Doctor Octopus' offer. The Avengers and Spider-Man try to convince the leaders they cannot negotiate with a supervillain.  When [[Al Gore]] says that Doctor Octopus would save them,  Spider-Man punches him, revealing to everyone that Gore is the Chameleon in disguise. Spider-Man explains his new costume can detect which person is actually Chameleon. Meanwhile, at Horizon Labs, Mayor J. Jonah Jameson gives orders to shut down the laboratories, saying he doesn't care about the rest of the world. Back in Rome, a transmission from Doctor Octopus states he has activated the Octavian Lens which are blocking the harmful UV rays from the sun in order to reinforce his offer. Spider-Man is forced to let Chameleon go, but secretly places a Spider-Tracer on him. They follow Chameleon to the Mediterranean Coast where the rest of the Sinister Six is waiting. Although [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] is able to hurl Electro into the upper atmosphere, the Sinister Six successfully subdue the Avengers using the objects stolen in the flashback. Doctor Octopus says he has succeeded in another goal, defeating Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683</ref>\n\nAs the remaining five members of the Sinister Six depart, [[Silver Sable]] (who has been watching the fight under cloak) manages to rescue [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and Spider-Man to track the Sinister Six. As Doctor Octopus issues his demands for two hundred facilities to be turned over to him to launch the missiles needed for the process to start (as well as two billion dollars for each of the Sinister Six), Spider-Man contacts Horizon Labs for help. Tracking one of the facilities in the Sahara Desert, Spider-Man, Black Widow and Silver Sable confront the Sandman. Spider-Man identifies and isolates the one grain of sand containing Sandman's [[consciousness]]. Inside the facility they realize it is a decoy as it was producing hollow shells of satellites. Doctor Octopus contacts the UN and orders them to turn their resources towards killing the 'global terror' Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #684</ref>\n\nOver the course of the next three days, Spider-Man, Black Widow and Silver Sable make hit-and-run attacks on the factories that are constructing Doctor Octopus' satellites. In Korea, they defeat the Rhino with Spider-Man's electrified webbing. However, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] forces arrive on the scene, not to take the Rhino into custody, but to arrest Spider-Man and his allies. With nearly all of the Earth's governments siding with Doctor Octopus, Spider-Man is considered Global Public Enemy #1. Back in New York City, Mayor Jameson declares martial law and has his Anti-Spider Squad patrol the streets to prevent looting. Mary Jane waits for Peter's return, confident that he will win against Doctor Octopus, and plans of a way to show everyone how much of a hero he truly is. Silver Sable begins to show signs of romantic feelings toward Spider-Man. After interrogating the captured Sandman for information they receive a surprising message from the [[Titanium Man]]. Spider-Man rallies [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]], [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]], [[Kangaroo (comics)#Kangaroo (Brian Hibbs)|Kangaroo II]], and the [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]] (consisting of [[GoGo Tomago]], [[Hiro Takachiho]], [[Fredzilla]], [[Honey Lemon]], [[Wasabi-No-Ginger]], and [[Ebon Samurai]]) to help stop the construction of Octavius' satellites. Spider-Man's group finds a deserted factory near the border between Symkaria and Romania. Doctor Octopus appears on the monitor, claiming victory as the last of his satellites had already been launched.  When Spider-Man goads him to prove he was going to save the world, Doctor Octopus instead admits that Spider-Man was right all along. Octavius does not want the 'mediocre and mundane' to live on while his genius dies, and begins to burn everything on Earth's day side.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #685</ref>\n\nWhile Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable are tracking down Doctor Octopus' location, Spider-Man's allies invade other facilities. In Japan, Big Hero 6 defeat Everwraith. In another facility, Sabra fights through an army of Octobots until she is shot by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. In Australia, Kangaroo II enters a facility and is ambushed by [[Lady Deathstrike]]. In another facility, Titanium Man is defeated by [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]]</ref>\n\nAs Spider-Man and his allies exit the factory, they see Symkaria being burned by Doctor Octopus' satellites. They are unaware that it is a ruse created by Mysterio and the Chameleon to distract them from the actual completion of the satellites. Meanwhile, Doctor Octopus again asks the people of Earth to aid him against those who are trying to stop his plans. He learns of Mysterio and Chameleon's actions and is enraged that Chameleon is battling Spider-Man in what Doctor Octopus believes should be HIS final duel with the wall-crawler. He takes control of Chameleon's battlesuit and tries to destroy Spider-Man, allowing Spider-Man and the others to realize Symkaria's destruction is fake. After defeating the battlesuit, Spider-Man convinces Mysterio to switch sides with the argument that $2 billion will be worthless if Doctor Octopus destroys the world. The team is led to a location in Guatemala where they are attacked by Octobot-controlled Avengers. During the battle, Spider-Man realizes all the inventions he has created at Horizon Labs have been hacked by Doctor Octopus.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #686</ref>\n\nAlthough the Octobot-controlled Iron Man knocks out Hawkeye and Black Widow, Spider-Man's new kung-fu training allows him to defeat Spider-Woman while Silver Sable knocks out Captain America, who was holding back to give her a chance. Spider-Man immobilizes Thor by tricking Octavius into taking full control (making Thor unworthy to wield his hammer), and Mysterio frees Iron Man and Red Hulk by using an EMP to disable the Octobots. While Thor, Hulk and Iron Man fly up to destroy Octavius's missiles, Mysterio gives Spider-Man and Silver Sable a ship that can take them to Doctor Octopus's sea fortress, then escapes. Upon arriving, they are confronted by the Rhino (who welcomes Octavius's plan to destroy the world), who pins Sable to the floor as water begins to flood the corridor. Silver Sable orders Spider-Man to leave her. Spider-Man finds Doctor Octopus who traps him with all eight arms. Doctor Octopus reveals he has calculated that 0.08% of Earth's population will survive, with those fifty thousand remembering him as the greatest mass murderer of all time. Unable to convince Doctor Octopus that the heat he is generating will fry the brains of the survivors, Spider-Man breaks free and destroys his enemy's equipment. Spider-Man is left to mourn the death of Silver Sable as he is rescued by the Horizon Labs staff on their boat. Spider-Man asks the Horizon Labs staff to build a life support unit for Doctor Octopus.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nSpider-Man spends the next few hours searching for Silver Sable's body, but is eventually relieved by the Black Widow (with orders from Captain America) who tells Spider-Man to help escort Doctor Octopus to the Raft. Since he is the expert on handling Doctor Octopus, Spider-Man is given no choice. Though Captain America tries to comfort the web-slinger by reminding him that Silver Sable knew the risks, Spider-Man instead reminisces about a past adventure with Silver Sable and how he got to know her better. He confronts Doctor Octopus and tells him that since his satellites will be destroyed, he will die without leaving any legacy. The Avengers depart with a final scene of an Octobot floating on the surface of the water.<ref>''The Avenging Spider-Man'' #8</ref> Octopus' story was continued in the November 2012 storyline \"[[Dying Wish]]\".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #698-700</ref>\n\nAfter ''Dying Wish'' while Octopus's mind is in Peter Parker's body for the duration of the ''[[Superior Spider-Man]]'' series, Octopus (who has turned into a sort of hero due to inheriting Peter's memories), he encounters the anti-hero [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]]. Cardiac is stealing technology in order to operate on a dying girl.

Spider-Man's group finds a deserted factory near the border between Symkaria and Romania. Doctor Octopus appears on the monitor, claiming victory as the last of his satellites had already been launched.  When Spider-Man goads him to prove he was going to save the world, Doctor Octopus instead admits that Spider-Man was right all along. Octavius does not want the 'mediocre and mundane' to live on while his genius dies, and begins to burn everything on Earth's day side.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #685</ref>\n\nWhile Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable are tracking down Doctor Octopus' location, Spider-Man's allies invade other facilities. In Japan, Big Hero 6 defeat Everwraith. In another facility, Sabra fights through an army of Octobots until she is shot by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. In Australia, Kangaroo II enters a facility and is ambushed by [[Lady Deathstrike]]. In another facility, Titanium Man is defeated by [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]]</ref>\n\nAs Spider-Man and his allies exit the factory, they see Symkaria being burned by Doctor Octopus' satellites. They are unaware that it is a ruse created by Mysterio and the Chameleon to distract them from the actual completion of the satellites. Meanwhile, Doctor Octopus again asks the people of Earth to aid him against those who are trying to stop his plans. He learns of Mysterio and Chameleon's actions and is enraged that Chameleon is battling Spider-Man in what Doctor Octopus believes should be HIS final duel with the wall-crawler. He takes control of Chameleon's battlesuit and tries to destroy Spider-Man, allowing Spider-Man and the others to realize Symkaria's destruction is fake. After defeating the battlesuit, Spider-Man convinces Mysterio to switch sides with the argument that $2 billion will be worthless if Doctor Octopus destroys the world. The team is led to a location in Guatemala where they are attacked by Octobot-controlled Avengers. During the battle, Spider-Man realizes all the inventions he has created at Horizon Labs have been hacked by Doctor Octopus.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #686</ref>\n\nAlthough the Octobot-controlled Iron Man knocks out Hawkeye and Black Widow, Spider-Man's new kung-fu training allows him to defeat Spider-Woman while Silver Sable knocks out Captain America, who was holding back to give her a chance. Spider-Man immobilizes Thor by tricking Octavius into taking full control (making Thor unworthy to wield his hammer), and Mysterio frees Iron Man and Red Hulk by using an EMP to disable the Octobots. While Thor, Hulk and Iron Man fly up to destroy Octavius's missiles, Mysterio gives Spider-Man and Silver Sable a ship that can take them to Doctor Octopus's sea fortress, then escapes. Upon arriving, they are confronted by the Rhino (who welcomes Octavius's plan to destroy the world), who pins Sable to the floor as water begins to flood the corridor. Silver Sable orders Spider-Man to leave her. Spider-Man finds Doctor Octopus who traps him with all eight arms. Doctor Octopus reveals he has calculated that 0.08% of Earth's population will survive, with those fifty thousand remembering him as the greatest mass murderer of all time. Unable to convince Doctor Octopus that the heat he is generating will fry the brains of the survivors, Spider-Man breaks free and destroys his enemy's equipment. Spider-Man is left to mourn the death of Silver Sable as he is rescued by the Horizon Labs staff on their boat. Spider-Man asks the Horizon Labs staff to build a life support unit for Doctor Octopus.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nSpider-Man spends the next few hours searching for Silver Sable's body, but is eventually relieved by the Black Widow (with orders from Captain America) who tells Spider-Man to help escort Doctor Octopus to the Raft. Since he is the expert on handling Doctor Octopus, Spider-Man is given no choice. Though Captain America tries to comfort the web-slinger by reminding him that Silver Sable knew the risks, Spider-Man instead reminisces about a past adventure with Silver Sable and how he got to know her better. He confronts Doctor Octopus and tells him that since his satellites will be destroyed, he will die without leaving any legacy. The Avengers depart with a final scene of an Octobot floating on the surface of the water.<ref>''The Avenging Spider-Man'' #8</ref> Octopus' story was continued in the November 2012 storyline \"[[Dying Wish]]\".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #698-700</ref>\n\nAfter ''Dying Wish'' while Octopus's mind is in Peter Parker's body for the duration of the ''[[Superior Spider-Man]]'' series, Octopus (who has turned into a sort of hero due to inheriting Peter's memories), he encounters the anti-hero [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]].

Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].\n\nTennyson also excelled at penning short lyrics, such as \"[[Break, Break, Break]]\", \"[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\", \"[[Tears, Idle Tears]]\", and \"[[Crossing the Bar]]\". Much of his verse was based on [[classical mythology|classical]] mythological themes, such as \"[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]\", although \"[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]\" was written to commemorate his friend [[Arthur Hallam]], a fellow poet and student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], after he died of a stroke at the age of 22.<ref>{{cite book|title=Queers in History| publisher=Quistory Publishers| year=2007| edition=2007| author=Stern, Keith}}</ref> Tennyson also wrote some notable [[blank verse]] including ''[[Idylls of the King]]'', \"[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]\", and \"[[Tithonus (poem)|Tithonus]]\".

He raised a large family and \"was a man of superior abilities and varied attainments, who tried his hand with fair success in architecture, painting, music, and poetry. He was comfortably well off for a country clergyman and his shrewd money management enabled the family to spend summers at [[Mablethorpe]] and [[Skegness]] on the eastern coast of England\". Alfred Tennyson's mother, Elizabeth Fytche (1781\u20131865), was the daughter of Stephen Fytche (1734\u20131799), vicar of [[St. James Church, Louth]] (1764) and rector of Withcall (1780), a small village between [[Horncastle, Lincolnshire|Horncastle]] and [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]]. Tennyson's father \"carefully attended to the education and training of his children\".\n\nTennyson and two of his elder brothers were writing poetry in their teens and a collection of poems by all three was published locally when Alfred was only 17. One of those brothers, [[Charles Tennyson Turner]], later married Louisa Sellwood, the younger sister of Alfred's [[Emily Tennyson, Lady Tennyson|future wife]]; the other was [[Frederick Tennyson]].

In 1855, Tennyson produced one of his best-known works, \"[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\", a dramatic tribute to the British cavalrymen involved in [[Charge of the Light Brigade|an ill-advised charge]] on 25 October 1854, during the [[Crimean War]].

They include recordings of \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", and excerpts from \"The splendour falls\" (from The Princess), \"Come into the garden\" (from [[Maud and other poems|Maud]]), \"Ask me no more\", \"Ode on the death of the Duke of Wellington\" and \"Lancelot and Elaine\".

In \"[[Locksley Hall Sixty Years After]],\" Tennyson wrote: \"Christian love among the churches look'd the twin of heathen hate.\" In his play, ''Becket'', he wrote: \"We are self-uncertain creatures, and we may, Yea, even when we know not, mix our spites and private hates with our defence of Heaven\". Tennyson recorded in his ''Diary'' (p.&nbsp;127): \"I believe in [[Pantheism]] of a sort\". His son's biography confirms that Tennyson was an unorthodox Christian, noting that Tennyson praised [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Spinoza]] on his deathbed, saying of Bruno, \"His view of God is in some ways mine\", in 1892.<ref>[http://ffrf.org/day/?day=6&month=8 Freethought of the Day, 6 August 2006, Alfred Tennyson] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121203013326/http://ffrf.org/day/?day=6&month=8 |date=3 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tennyson Monument, Tennyson Down, IW, UK.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Monument to Tennyson on [[Tennyson Down]], Isle of Wight]]\nTennyson continued writing into his eighties.

The insistent beat of ''Break, Break, Break'' emphasises the relentless sadness of the subject matter. Tennyson's use of the musical qualities of words to emphasise his rhythms and meanings is sensitive. The language of \"I come from haunts of coot and hern\" lilts and ripples like the brook in the poem and the last two lines of \"Come down O maid from yonder mountain height\" illustrate his telling combination of [[onomatopoeia]], [[alliteration]], and [[assonance]]:\n\n: The moan of doves in immemorial elms\n: And murmuring of innumerable bees.\nTennyson was a craftsman who polished and revised his manuscripts extensively, to the point where his efforts at self-editing were described by his contemporary [[Robert Browning]] as \"insane\", symptomatic of \"mental infirmity\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=John Haydn|title=Browning and Wordsworth|date=2004|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|location=Cranbury NJ|isbn=0838640389|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sj4SoOOutwC |accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref> His complex compositional practice and frequent redrafting also demonstrates a dynamic relationship between images and text, as can be seen in the many notebooks he worked in.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tennyson|url=https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/tennyson|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=5 October 2017}}</ref> Few poets have used such a variety of styles with such an exact understanding of [[meter (poetry)|metre]]; like many Victorian poets, he experimented in adapting the [[Meter (poetry)#Greek and Latin|quantitative metres]] of Greek and Latin poetry to English.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pattison|first1=Robert|title=Tennyson and Tradition|date=1979|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0674874153|page=[https://archive.org/details/tennysontraditio0000patt/page/106 106]|url=https://archive.org/details/tennysontraditio0000patt|url-access=registration|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref> He reflects the [[Victorian period]] of his maturity in his feeling for order and his tendency towards moralising.

Alfred Tennyson's mother, Elizabeth Fytche (1781\u20131865), was the daughter of Stephen Fytche (1734\u20131799), vicar of [[St. James Church, Louth]] (1764) and rector of Withcall (1780), a small village between [[Horncastle, Lincolnshire|Horncastle]] and [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]]. Tennyson's father \"carefully attended to the education and training of his children\".\n\nTennyson and two of his elder brothers were writing poetry in their teens and a collection of poems by all three was published locally when Alfred was only 17. One of those brothers, [[Charles Tennyson Turner]], later married Louisa Sellwood, the younger sister of Alfred's [[Emily Tennyson, Lady Tennyson|future wife]]; the other was [[Frederick Tennyson]].

Tennyson fulfilled the requirements of this position by turning out appropriate but often uninspired verse, such as a poem of greeting to [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra of Denmark]] when she arrived in Britain to marry the future King [[Edward VII]]. In 1855, Tennyson produced one of his best-known works, \"[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\", a dramatic tribute to the British cavalrymen involved in [[Charge of the Light Brigade|an ill-advised charge]] on 25 October 1854, during the [[Crimean War]].
