In a [[parliamentary system]], the [[executive branch]] is ultimately dependent upon the will of the [[legislature]]; although the legislature does not issue orders directly to the armed forces and therefore does not control the military in any operational sense. [[Governor-general|Governors-general]] and colonial governors are also often appointed commander-in-chief of the military forces within their territory.\n\nA commander-in-chief is sometimes referred to as ''supreme commander'', which is sometimes used as a specific term. The term is also used for military officers who hold such power and authority, not always through dictatorship, and as a subordinate (usually) to a head of state (see [[Generalissimo]]). The term is also used for officers who hold authority over an individual [[military branch]], [[special branch]] or within a [[theatre of operations]].<ref>Dupuy, Trevor N., Curt Johnson, and Grace P.

As a technical term, it refers to military competencies that reside in a country's executive leadership \u2013 a [[head of state]] or a [[head of government]].\n\nOften, a commander-in-chief role if held by an [[official]], need not be or have been a [[commissioned officer]] or even a [[veteran]]. Such countries follow the principle of [[civilian control of the military]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe formal role and title of a ruler commanding the armed forces derives from ''[[Imperator]]'' of the [[Roman Kingdom]], [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]], who possessed ''imperium'' (command and other regal) powers.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Auctor.html LacusCurtius \u2022 Roman Law \u2014 Auctor (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)]</ref>\n\nIn English use, the term first applied to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] in 1639.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} It continued to be used during the [[English Civil War]].<ref>For example: \"Ordered, That this House joins and agrees with the House of Commons in this Vote; and that the Lord Admiral is hereby desired, from both Houses of Parliament, that the Commander in Chief of this Summer's Fleet under his Lordship, may be the Earl of Warwicke.\", [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/lords-jrnl/vol4/pp645-646#h3-0007 House of Lords Journal 15 March 1642]</ref> A nation's [[head of state]] (monarchical or republican) usually holds the nominal position of commander-in-chief, even if effective executive power is held by a separate [[head of government]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], the [[executive branch]] is ultimately dependent upon the will of the [[legislature]]; although the legislature does not issue orders directly to the armed forces and therefore does not control the military in any operational sense. [[Governor-general|Governors-general]] and colonial governors are also often appointed commander-in-chief of the military forces within their territory.\n\nA commander-in-chief is sometimes referred to as ''supreme commander'', which is sometimes used as a specific term. The term is also used for military officers who hold such power and authority, not always through dictatorship, and as a subordinate (usually) to a head of state (see [[Generalissimo]]). The term is also used for officers who hold authority over an individual [[military branch]], [[special branch]] or within a [[theatre of operations]].<ref>Dupuy, Trevor N., Curt Johnson, and Grace P.

The office of the Venezuelan military supreme commander in chief has always been held by the president of Venezuela as per constitutional requirements. However, with a new law sanctioned in 2008, the \"comandante en jefe\" rank is not only a function attributed to the executive branch but a full military rank given to the president upon taking office. Upon assumption he receives a saber, epaulette, shoulder knot, shoulder board and sleeve insignia and full military uniform to be used in military events while performing the duties as president. The shoulder insignia mirrors Cuban practice but is derived from the German-styled officer rank insignia.\n\n===Vietnam===\nThe commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the [[president of Vietnam]], through his post as chairman of National Defense and Security Council. Though this position is nominal and real power is assumed by the [[Central Military Commission (Vietnam)|Central Military Commission]] of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]]. The secretary of Central Military Commission (usually the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam|general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam]]) is the ''de facto'' commander.\n\nThe [[Ministry of Defence (Vietnam)|minister of Defence]] oversees operations of the Ministry of Defence, and the [[Vietnam People's Army]].

{"title_page": "Fictional planets of the Solar System", "text_new": "{{see also|Solar System in fiction}}\nThe fictional portrayal of the [[Solar System]] has often included planets, moons, and other celestial objects which do not actually exist in reality. Some of these objects were, at one time, seriously considered as [[List of hypothetical Solar System objects|hypothetical planets]] which were either thought to have been observed, or were hypothesized to be orbiting the Sun in order to explain certain celestial phenomena. Often such objects continued to be used in literature long after the hypotheses upon which they were based had been abandoned.\n\nOther non-existent Solar System objects used in fiction have been proposed or hypothesized by persons with no scientific standing, while yet others are purely fictional and were never intended as serious hypotheses about the structure of the Solar System.\n\n== Vulcan ==\n{{Main|Vulcan (hypothetical planet)}}\n'''Vulcan''' was a hypothetical planet supposed to revolve around the Sun inside the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], invoked to explain certain irregularities in Mercury's orbit.  The planet was proposed as a hypothesis in 1859, and abandoned not later than 1915.\n\n* \"Vulcan's Workshop\" (''[[Astounding Stories]]'', June 1932), short story by [[Harl Vincent]]: a penal colony is located on Vulcan.<ref>Uploaded to [[Project Gutenberg]] on 5 July 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/29321 |title=Vulcan's Workshop by Harl Vincent - Free Ebook |publisher=[[Gutenberg.org]] |date=2009-07-05 |accessdate=2013-11-16}}</ref>\n* \"At the Center of Gravity\" (''[[Astounding Stories]]'', June 1936), short story by [[Ross Rocklynne]]: two people are trapped inside a hollow Vulcan.<ref>Republished in the 1963 anthology ''Exploring Other Worlds'' ({{ISBN|0-02-023110-5}}) and the 1973 collection ''The Men and the Mirror'' ({{ISBN|0-441-52460-5}})</ref>\n* Vulcan is part of the Solar System in the ''[[Captain Future]]'' series.

During the return of the first manned flight to Mercury, a crew member notices a dark spot moving across the Sun.  Since the spot is between them and the Sun and appears to be moving to the naked eye, it can only be the previously-hypothetical Vulcan; it must be moving rapidly and extremely close to the Sun.\n\nThe name \"Vulcan\" has been used for various other fictional planets, in and out of the Solar System, that do not correspond to the hypothetical planet Vulcan. The planet [[Vulcan (Star Trek planet)|Vulcan]] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, for instance, is specified as orbiting [[40 Eridani|40 Eridani A]].\n\n== Counter-Earth ==\n{{Main|Counter-Earth}}\n'''Counter-Earth''' was a hypothetical planet sharing an orbit with Earth, but on the opposite side of the Sun (hence Earth and Counter-Earth would always be invisible to each other).

Following the general reception of Pluto as the ninth planet of the Solar System in 1930, a hypothetical additional planet was sometimes called a \"tenth planet\".  Since 1992, a very large number of objects have been found beyond Neptune; all the objects in the following list, however, are purely fictional. Common names for trans-Neptunian planets in fiction include '''Planet X''', after a planet once believed to lie beyond Neptune, '''[[Persephone]]''' (or '''[[Proserpina]]'''), after the wife of Pluto, and '''[[Minerva]]''', after the Roman goddess of wisdom and education (which would fit with a planet discovered through mathematical predictions rather than direct observation).\n\n===Literature===\n*''[[In the Year 2889 (short story)|In the Year 2889]]'' (1889) short story by [[Jules Verne]]: Olympus is a massive planet beyond Neptune.

Lovecraft]], and other stories of the [[Cthulhu mythos]] by various writers: Lovecraft identifies [[Yuggoth]] (or Iukkoth) with Pluto, but other writers in the mythos claim that it is actually an enormous, trans-Neptunian world that orbits perpendicularly to the ecliptic of the Solar System, accompanied by three moons: ''Nithon, Thog'' and ''Thok''. Italian astronomer Albino Carbognani has suggested that any real-life planet discovered beyond Pluto might be named Yuggoth.<ref>Albino Carbognani, \"Pluto and the astronomy of H.P.

The periodicity of these raids is a consequence of the tenth planet's highly elliptical 2,006-year orbit, which closely approaches Earth only on two occasions near the tenth planet's [[Apsis|perihelion]].  The tenth planet, known as Malmur to its inhabitants, is in fact a captured [[rogue planet]], ejected from its original solar system.\n*''[[Galileo's Dream]]'' (2009) by [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] There are several outer gas giants named, some of which are described as having been converted into energy for time travel. The tenth planet is named Hades.\n*''Take Back the Sky'' (2016), the third book of the ''[[War Dogs (novel)|War Dogs]]'' trilogy reveals that numerous trans-Neptunian planets exist in the distant outer reaches of the Solar System.  The homeworld of the alien Antags (Antagonists) is one such planet.  Called the Sun-Planet, it is an artificial world consisting of a thin solid surface wrapped around a low-density gaseous interior, five times the mass of [[Jupiter]] and nearly the diameter of the [[Sun]].  The Sun-Planet is kept at a habitable temperature by artificial fusion at its core.\n\n===Film, TV, and radio===\n*''The Tenth Planet'', radio play broadcast Sept. 7, 1952 on ''[[Hollywood Star Playhouse]]''. It starred [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Hans Conreid]], and [[Joan Banks Lovejoy]].  Cotten is kidnapped by aliens inhabiting a planet beyond Pluto.\n* In the 1975 TV series ''[[Star Maidens]]'', the planet ruled by women is known as Medusa. Described by one of the Medusans as being \"on the outer limits of your solar system\", the opening titles of the premiere episode indicates that a comet pulled Medusa out of orbit around [[Proxima Centauri]]\u2014forcing its people underground\u2014and it eventually slipped into orbit around the Earth's Sun. No longer in the heat of Proxima Centauri, Medusa is small, rocky and cold, though the Medusans have the technology to conduct industrial operations on the surface.\n* ''Star Trek Maps'', a 1970s publication by [[Bantam Books]], indicates that the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe includes a tenth planet in the Solar System called Persephone that orbits at a great distance from the Sun. This statement is not supported by any ''Star Trek'' film or TV episode (the original series episode \"[[The Changeling (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Changeling]]\" mentions only nine planets exist in the Solar System), and a later, similar work, ''[[Star Trek Star Charts]]'' by [[Pocket Books]], makes no mention of this world.\n* ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' (1986\u20131990): In one episode, ALF reveals to Brian that two planets exist beyond Pluto. When Willie sarcastically asks if they are named \"[[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]\" and \"[[Donald Duck|Donald]],\" ALF matter-of-factly tells him no; they are named \"Dave\" and \"Alvin.\" Later Willie explains that \"Dave\" could be [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]], a minor planet once labeled the \"tenth planet\" by the press.\n* ''[[K-PAX]]'' (2001 film): An alien character played by [[Kevin Spacey]] tells the character played by [[Jeff Bridges]] that there are ten planets in Bridges's Solar System.\n* The cartoon ''[[Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2 Century]]'' features astronauts [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]] looking for \"Planet X\", and then having to battle [[Marvin the Martian]] for it.\n\n===Animation===\n* In the anime series ''[[The Vision of Escaflowne]]'' (1996), there exists an invisible (from Earth) third member of the Earth-Moon system, called Gaea, on which the majority of the story takes place. The Earth, which is visible in the Gaean sky along with the Moon, is referred to as the \"Mystic Moon\".\n* In the anime series ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (1974) there are eleven planets in the Solar System. In the English dub, the first season names the tenth planet Minerva (destroyed by the Gamilons, it's not clear if it became an entire asteroid belt or just a large asteroid field), and the second season names the eleventh planet Brumus (attacked by the Comet Empire).\n* In the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series (1989\u20131996), there's a tenth Planet or a brown dwarf called the Makyo Star. Every 12,000 years, it passes close to Earth which powers all the Makyo demons inhabiting Earth.\n* In the ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' series (1992\u20131997), there exists a tenth Planet called Nemesis which is controlled by the villains of the [[Black Moon Clan]]. The planet is said to be radiating negative energy and can disappear from sight, only trackable via X-rays.\n* In the animated television series ''[[Exosquad]]'' (1993), the [[Solar System]] contains an invisible tenth planet composed of [[dark matter]]. It was discovered by the Pirate Clans who named it [[Exosquad planets#Chaos|Chaos]] and later offered it as safe haven to the [[Exofleet]].\n* In the ''[[Mutant Chronicles]]'' universe (1993), the 10th Planet, Nero, is the home of portals used by The Dark Legion to gain access into our galaxy through which they plan to enslave or destroy mankind.

A happy ending ensues when Earthmen provide safe nuclear technology in return for thought projections from Hesikos to reduce fear and aggression here.\n* Eros appeared in a [[Golden Age (comics)|Golden Age]] [[Wonder Woman]] story. It is ruled by women who consider prison terms a reward and are more scientifically advanced than Earth. It can be reached through astral projection while sleeping. Wonder Woman is sent there by [[Queen Desira]] to fight a rogue female scientist who is trying to help men take over the planet.\n* Twin Earth: a hypothetical duplicate of the Earth and everything on it (in an unspecified location), as a [[thought experiment]] by philosopher [[Saul Kripke]] about names: the fact that everything you could say about someone or something on the Earth would be equally true of its counterpart on Twin Earth shows that names can't merely be shorthand for descriptions, as they may not uniquely identify a person/object.\n* The short story \"The Mysterious Finding\" (\"\u0417\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430\") by [[Vladimir Obruchev]] (1947) features the discovery of an artificial meteorite containing the last message of a race living on a planet similar to Phaeton, though it used to be located between Earth and Mars. By the time the log is written, it is months away from being destroyed by a critical destabilization caused by nuclear bombardment of an extinct volcano.\n\n==Rogue planets==\n{{Main|Rogue planet}}\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}\nRogue planets in fiction usually originate outside the Solar System, but their erratic paths lead them to within detectable range of Earth.

The broken Moon was often seen in the sky throughout various episodes.\n*''[[Transformers]]'' (1984) toys and spinoffs: Cybertron is a robot-inhabited rogue planet that comes close to Earth. In the Generation One cartoon timeline, this only occurs after the events of the three part episode ''The Ultimate Doom'', in which Cybertron is brought into Earth's solar system (and specifically into Earth's actual orbit) by the use of a space bridge big enough to transport the entire planet. Afterwards, it is shown to exist somewhere reasonably close to Earth's Solar System after it is pushed out of Earth's orbit. Characters such as Starscream, Omega Supreme, and Astrotrain are later shown to be able to travel from Earth to Cybertron and back with relative ease depending on the plot of the story.

This statement is not supported by any ''Star Trek'' film or TV episode (the original series episode \"[[The Changeling (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Changeling]]\" mentions only nine planets exist in the Solar System), and a later, similar work, ''[[Star Trek Star Charts]]'' by [[Pocket Books]], makes no mention of this world.\n* ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' (1986\u20131990): In one episode, ALF reveals to Brian that two planets exist beyond Pluto.

The Earth, which is visible in the Gaean sky along with the Moon, is referred to as the \"Mystic Moon\".\n* In the anime series ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (1974) there are eleven planets in the Solar System. In the English dub, the first season names the tenth planet Minerva (destroyed by the Gamilons, it's not clear if it became an entire asteroid belt or just a large asteroid field), and the second season names the eleventh planet Brumus (attacked by the Comet Empire).\n* In the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series (1989\u20131996), there's a tenth Planet or a brown dwarf called the Makyo Star. Every 12,000 years, it passes close to Earth which powers all the Makyo demons inhabiting Earth.\n* In the ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' series (1992\u20131997), there exists a tenth Planet called Nemesis which is controlled by the villains of the [[Black Moon Clan]]. The planet is said to be radiating negative energy and can disappear from sight, only trackable via X-rays.\n* In the animated television series ''[[Exosquad]]'' (1993), the [[Solar System]] contains an invisible tenth planet composed of [[dark matter]]. It was discovered by the Pirate Clans who named it [[Exosquad planets#Chaos|Chaos]] and later offered it as safe haven to the [[Exofleet]].\n* In the ''[[Mutant Chronicles]]'' universe (1993), the 10th Planet, Nero, is the home of portals used by The Dark Legion to gain access into our galaxy through which they plan to enslave or destroy mankind.

The broken Moon was often seen in the sky throughout various episodes.\n*''[[Transformers]]'' (1984) toys and spinoffs: Cybertron is a robot-inhabited rogue planet that comes close to Earth. In the Generation One cartoon timeline, this only occurs after the events of the three part episode ''The Ultimate Doom'', in which Cybertron is brought into Earth's solar system (and specifically into Earth's actual orbit) by the use of a space bridge big enough to transport the entire planet. Afterwards, it is shown to exist somewhere reasonably close to Earth's Solar System after it is pushed out of Earth's orbit. Characters such as Starscream, Omega Supreme, and Astrotrain are later shown to be able to travel from Earth to Cybertron and back with relative ease depending on the plot of the story. Later incarnations of Cybertron are either rogue planets or else have a method of near instant transportation to and from Earth.\n*''[[Sunstorm (novel)|Sunstorm]]'' (2005), an alien race from the star system of Altair sends a rogue Jovian planet into the Sun, setting the stage for a solar storm intended to wipe out humanity in the year 2042.\n*''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' (2011), a planet emerges from behind the Sun and approaches Earth, initially passing by, before coming back on a collision course.

Bavarian forms a [[dialect continuum|continuum]] of more or less [[mutually intelligible]] local and regional variants.\n\nBavarian has been listed as an \"individual language\" in the [[ISO 639-3|ISO 693-3]] standard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=bar|title=Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: bar|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{further|Upper German|German dialects}}\nThe [[Bavarians]] as a group formed in the early medieval period, as the population of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], forming the south-eastern part of the [[kingdom of Germany]]. The [[Old High German]] documents from the area of Bavaria are identified as {{lang|de|Altbairisch}} (\"Old Bavarian\"), even though at this early date there are few distinctive features that would divide it from [[Alemannic German]].\n\nThe dialectal separation of Upper German into East Upper German (Bavarian) and West Upper German (Alemannic) becomes more tangible in the [[Middle High German]] period, from about the 12th century.\n\n==Geographical distribution and dialects==\n[[File:Dialecto austro-b\u00e1varo.PNG|thumb|Map of the distribution of Bavarian speakers in Europe.]]\n*In Europe:\n**In [[Bavaria]], the language is spoken in [[Upper Bavaria]], [[Lower Bavaria]], and the [[Upper Palatinate]];\n**In [[Austria]], except [[Vorarlberg]] and [[Reutte District|Reutte]];\n**In [[Italy]] in South Tyrol and a handful of linguistic enclaves of Cimbrian and Carnic people in [[Northern Italy]];\n**In [[Switzerland]], it is spoken in the village of [[Samnaun]], in [[Grisons]];\n**In [[Sopron]] ([[Hungary]]) and surroundings.\n\n*Outside of Europe:\n**In [[Treze T\u00edlias]], Brazil\n**In [[Oxapampa|Pozuzo, Peru]]\n**In [[Hutterite German|the united States and Canada]]\n\nThree main dialect groups in Bavarian are:\n* [[Northern Bavarian]], mainly spoken in [[Upper Palatinate]], but also in adjacent areas (small parts of [[Upper Franconia]] ([[Wunsiedel (district)]] and [[Bayreuth (district)]]), [[Saxony]] (southern [[Vogtland]]), [[Middle Franconia]], [[Upper Bavaria]] and [[Lower Bavaria]]).\n* [[Central Bavarian]] along the main rivers [[Isar]] and [[Danube]], spoken in [[Upper Bavaria]] (including [[Munich]], which has a standard German speaking majority), [[Lower Bavaria]], southern [[Upper Palatinate]], the [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Swabian]] district of [[Aichach-Friedberg]], the northern parts of the [[Salzburg (state)|State of Salzburg]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Vienna]] (''see [[Viennese German]]'') and the Northern [[Burgenland]].\n* [[Southern Bavarian]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[South Tyrol]], [[Carinthia]], [[Styria]], and the southern parts of Salzburg and Burgenland.\n\nDifferences are clearly noticeable within those three subgroups, which in Austria often coincide with the borders of the particular states. For example, each of the accents of Carinthia, Styria, and Tyrol can be easily recognised. Also, there is a marked difference between eastern and western central Bavarian, roughly coinciding with the border between Austria and Bavaria. In addition, the Viennese dialect has some characteristics distinguishing it from all other dialects. In Vienna, minor, but recognizable, variations are characteristic for distinct districts of the city.\n\n==Use==\n{{for|the use of Bavarian and standard German in Austria|Austrian German}}\n[[File:Rottach-Egern - Kramer Lad\u2019l - Essen ist ein Bed\u00fcrfnis.jpg|thumb|Public sign combining Standard German and Bavarian.]]\nIn contrast to many other varieties of German, Bavarian differs sufficiently from [[Standard German]] to make it difficult for native speakers to adopt standard pronunciation. All educated [[Bavarians]] and [[Austrians]], however, can read, write and understand Standard German, but may have very little opportunity to speak it, especially in rural areas. In those regions, Standard German is restricted to use as the language of writing and the media. It is therefore often referred to as {{lang|de|Schriftdeutsch}} (\"written German\") rather than the usual term {{lang|de|Hochdeutsch}} (\"[[High German languages|High German]]\" or \"Standard German\").\n\n===School===\nBavaria and Austria officially use Standard German as the primary medium of education. With the spread of universal education, the exposure of speakers of Bavarian to Standard German has been increasing, and many younger people, especially in the region's cities and larger towns, speak Standard German with only a slight accent. This accent usually only exists in families where Bavarian is spoken regularly. Families that do not use Bavarian at home usually use Standard German instead. In Austria, some parts of grammar and spelling are taught in Standard German lessons.\nAs reading and writing in Bavarian is generally not taught at schools, almost all literate speakers of the language prefer to use Standard German for writing.

With very few exceptions, nouns are not inflected for case.\n* The [[preterite|simple past]] tense is very rare in Bavarian and has been retained for only a few verbs, including 'to be' and 'to want'. In general, the perfect is used to express past time.\n* Bavarian features verbal inflection for several moods such as [[indicative]], [[subjunctive]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]].

Bavarians often refer to names with the family name coming first (like ''da Stoiber Ede'' instead of [[Edmund Stoiber]]). The use of the article is considered mandatory when using this linguistic variation. In addition, nicknames different from the family name exist for almost all families, especially in small villages. They consist largely of their profession, names or professions of deceased inhabitants of their homes or the site where their homes are located. This nickname is called ''Hausname'' (en: name of the house) and is seldom used to name the person, but more to state where they come from or live or to whom they are related. Examples of this are:\n* Mohler (e.g. ''Maler'' \u2013 painter)\n* Bachbauer (farmer who lives near a brook)\n* Moosrees (Resi who lives near a brook)\n* Schreiner (joiner)\n\n== Samples of Bavarian and Austrian ==\n\n[[File:Bavarian (Wikitongues).ogg|thumb|Spoken Bavarian]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The [[Old High German]] documents from the area of Bavaria are identified as {{lang|de|Altbairisch}} (\"Old Bavarian\"), even though at this early date there are few distinctive features that would divide it from [[Alemannic German]].\n\nThe dialectal separation of Upper German into East Upper German (Bavarian) and West Upper German (Alemannic) becomes more tangible in the [[Middle High German]] period, from about the 12th century.\n\n==Geographical distribution and dialects==\n[[File:Dialecto austro-b\u00e1varo.PNG|thumb|Map of the distribution of Bavarian speakers in Europe.]]\n*In Europe:\n**In [[Bavaria]], the language is spoken in [[Upper Bavaria]], [[Lower Bavaria]], and the [[Upper Palatinate]];\n**In [[Austria]], except [[Vorarlberg]] and [[Reutte District|Reutte]];\n**In [[Italy]] in South Tyrol and a handful of linguistic enclaves of Cimbrian and Carnic people in [[Northern Italy]];\n**In [[Switzerland]], it is spoken in the village of [[Samnaun]], in [[Grisons]];\n**In [[Sopron]] ([[Hungary]]) and surroundings.\n\n*Outside of Europe:\n**In [[Treze T\u00edlias]], Brazil\n**In [[Oxapampa|Pozuzo, Peru]]\n**In [[Hutterite German|the united States and Canada]]\n\nThree main dialect groups in Bavarian are:\n* [[Northern Bavarian]], mainly spoken in [[Upper Palatinate]], but also in adjacent areas (small parts of [[Upper Franconia]] ([[Wunsiedel (district)]] and [[Bayreuth (district)]]), [[Saxony]] (southern [[Vogtland]]), [[Middle Franconia]], [[Upper Bavaria]] and [[Lower Bavaria]]).\n* [[Central Bavarian]] along the main rivers [[Isar]] and [[Danube]], spoken in [[Upper Bavaria]] (including [[Munich]], which has a standard German speaking majority), [[Lower Bavaria]], southern [[Upper Palatinate]], the [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Swabian]] district of [[Aichach-Friedberg]], the northern parts of the [[Salzburg (state)|State of Salzburg]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Vienna]] (''see [[Viennese German]]'') and the Northern [[Burgenland]].\n* [[Southern Bavarian]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[South Tyrol]], [[Carinthia]], [[Styria]], and the southern parts of Salzburg and Burgenland.\n\nDifferences are clearly noticeable within those three subgroups, which in Austria often coincide with the borders of the particular states. For example, each of the accents of Carinthia, Styria, and Tyrol can be easily recognised. Also, there is a marked difference between eastern and western central Bavarian, roughly coinciding with the border between Austria and Bavaria. In addition, the Viennese dialect has some characteristics distinguishing it from all other dialects. In Vienna, minor, but recognizable, variations are characteristic for distinct districts of the city.\n\n==Use==\n{{for|the use of Bavarian and standard German in Austria|Austrian German}}\n[[File:Rottach-Egern - Kramer Lad\u2019l - Essen ist ein Bed\u00fcrfnis.jpg|thumb|Public sign combining Standard German and Bavarian.]]\nIn contrast to many other varieties of German, Bavarian differs sufficiently from [[Standard German]] to make it difficult for native speakers to adopt standard pronunciation. All educated [[Bavarians]] and [[Austrians]], however, can read, write and understand Standard German, but may have very little opportunity to speak it, especially in rural areas. In those regions, Standard German is restricted to use as the language of writing and the media. It is therefore often referred to as {{lang|de|Schriftdeutsch}} (\"written German\") rather than the usual term {{lang|de|Hochdeutsch}} (\"[[High German languages|High German]]\" or \"Standard German\").\n\n===School===\nBavaria and Austria officially use Standard German as the primary medium of education. With the spread of universal education, the exposure of speakers of Bavarian to Standard German has been increasing, and many younger people, especially in the region's cities and larger towns, speak Standard German with only a slight accent. This accent usually only exists in families where Bavarian is spoken regularly. Families that do not use Bavarian at home usually use Standard German instead. In Austria, some parts of grammar and spelling are taught in Standard German lessons.\nAs reading and writing in Bavarian is generally not taught at schools, almost all literate speakers of the language prefer to use Standard German for writing. Regional authors and literature may play a role in education as well, but by and large, Standard German is the ''lingua franca''.\n\n===Literature===\nAlthough there exist grammars, [[vocabularies]], and a translation of the [[Bible]] in Bavarian, there is no common orthographic standard. Poetry is written in various Bavarian dialects, and many pop songs use the language as well, especially ones belonging to the [[Austropop]] wave of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nAlthough Bavarian as a spoken language is in daily use in its region, Standard German, often with strong regional influence, is preferred in the [[mass media]].\n\n[[Ludwig Thoma]] is a noted author who wrote works such as {{lang|de|Lausbubengeschichten|italic=yes}} in Bavarian.\n\n===Web===\nThere is a [[:bar:|Bavarian Wikipedia]], completely in Bavarian. Also, the official [[FC Bayern Munich]] website is available in Bavarian.<ref>https://fcbayern.com/by</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! &nbsp;\n![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n![[Labiodental consonant|Labio-<br />dental]]\n!|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n![[Postalveolar consonant|Post-<br />alveolar]]\n![[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! {{left}} [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA|m}}\n|\n| {{IPA|n}}\n|\n| \n| {{IPA|\u014b}}\n|\n|-\n! {{left}} [[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n| {{IPA|p}}\u2003{{IPA|b}}\n|\n| {{IPA|t}}\u2003{{IPA|d}}\n| \n|\n| {{IPA|k}}\u2003{{IPA|\u0261}}\n| ({{IPA|\u0294}})\n|-\n! {{left}} [[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n| {{IPA|p\u0361f}}\n|\n| {{IPA|t\u0361s}}\n| {{IPA|t\u0361\u0283}}\n| \n|\n| \n|-\n! {{left}} [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n|\n| {{IPA|f}}\u2003{{IPA|v}}\n| {{IPA|s}}\n| {{IPA|\u0283}}\n| ({{IPA|\u00e7}})\n| {{IPA|x}}\n| {{IPA|h}}\n|-\n! {{left}} [[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|\n|\n| {{IPA|r}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! {{left}} [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| \n|\n| {{IPA|l}}\n|\n| {{IPA|j}}\n|\n|\n|}\n\nNotes:\n\n*The phoneme {{IPA|/h/}} is frequently realised as {{IPAblink|\u00e7}} or {{IPAblink|x}} word-internally and is realised as {{IPAblink|h}} word-initially.\n*Intervocalic {{IPA|/s/}} can be voiced to {{IPAblink|z}}.\n*A trill sound {{IPA|/r/}} may also be realised as a tap sound [{{IPA link|\u027e}}].\n*Intervocalic {{IPA|/v/}} or {{IPA|/w/}} sound can be realised as [{{IPA link|\u028b}}] or [{{IPA link|\u03b2}}, {{IPA link|w}}].\n*Some dialects, such as the Bavarian dialect in South Tyrol, realise {{IPA|/k/}} as an affricate {{IPAblink|k\u0361x}} word-initially and before {{IPA|/m, n, l, r/}}, which is an extension of the [[High German consonant shift]] to velar consonants.\n\n===Vowels===\nVowel phonemes in parentheses occur only in certain Austro-Bavarian dialects or only appear as allophones or in diphthongs.

Vowels can be grouped as back rounded, front unrounded and front rounded. They are also traditionally distinguished by [[vowel length|length]] or [[tenseness]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n\nThe commonly accepted grammar and spelling system for Bavarian has been documented by A. Schmeller;<ref>Schmeller, Johann Andreas;  edited by Frommann, Georg Carl (1872).

With very few exceptions, nouns are not inflected for case.\n* The [[preterite|simple past]] tense is very rare in Bavarian and has been retained for only a few verbs, including 'to be' and 'to want'. In general, the perfect is used to express past time.\n* Bavarian features verbal inflection for several moods such as [[indicative]], [[subjunctive]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]]. See the table below for inflection of the Bavarian verb ''m\u00e5cha'', 'make; do':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"40\" | ''m\u00e5cha''\n! width=\"140\" | Indicative\n! width=\"140\" | Imperative\n! width=\"140\" | Subjunctive\n! width=\"140\" | Optative\n|-\n|1.&nbsp;Sg||i m\u00e5ch||\u2014||i m\u00e5chad||m\u00e5chadi\n|-\n|2.&nbsp;Sg (informal)||du m\u00e5chst||m\u00e5ch!||du m\u00e5chast||m\u00e5chast\n|-\n|3.&nbsp;Sg||er m\u00e5cht||er m\u00e5ch!||er m\u00e5chad||m\u00e5chada\n|-\n|1.&nbsp;Pl||mia m\u00e5chan*||m\u00e5chma!||mia m\u00e5chadn||m\u00e5chadma\n|-\n|2.&nbsp;Pl||e\u00df m\u00e5chts||m\u00e5chts!||e\u00df m\u00e5chats||m\u00e5chats\n|-\n|3.&nbsp;Pl||se m\u00e5chan(t)||\u2014||se m\u00e5chadn||m\u00e5chadns\n|-\n|2.&nbsp;Sg (formal)||Si m\u00e5chan||m\u00e5chan\u2019S!||Si m\u00e5chadn||m\u00e5chadn\u2019S\n|}\n\n===Pronouns===\n====Personal pronouns====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!||colspan=4|Singular||colspan=3|Plural\n|-\n!!!1st person !!2nd person informal!!2nd person formal!!3rd person\n!1st person!!2nd person!!3rd person\n|-\n!Nominative\n|i||du||Si||ea, se/de, des||mia||e\u00df/\u00f6\u00df / ia*||se\n|-\n|''Unstressed''\n|i||--|| -'S|| -a, -'s, -'s|| -ma|| -'s|| -'s\n|-\n!Dative\n|mia||dia||Eana||eam, eara/iara, dem||uns, ins||enk / eich*||ea, eana\n|-\n|''Unstressed''\n| -ma|| -da|| || || || ||\n|-\n!Accusative\n| -mi|| -di||Eana||eam, eara/iara, des||uns, ins||enk / eich*||ea, eana\n|-\n|''Unstressed''\n| || ||Si|| -'n, \u2026, -'s|| || || -'s\n|}\n\n<small>* These are typically used in the very northern dialects of Bavarian.</small>\n\n====Possessive pronouns====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!||colspan=4|Predicative||colspan=4|Attributive\n|-\n!!!Masculine singular!!Feminine singular!!Neuter singular!!Plural (any gender)\n!Masculine singular!!Feminine singular!!Neuter singular!!Plural (any gender)\n|-\n!Nominative\n|mei||mei||mei||meine||meina||meine||mei(n)s||meine\n|-\n!Dative\n|meim||meina||meim||meine||meim||meina||meim||meine\n|-\n!Accusative\n|mein||mei||mei||meine||mein||meine||mei(n)s||meine\n|}\n\nThe possessive pronouns ''Deina'' and ''Seina'' inflect in the same manner. Oftentimes, ''nige'' is added to the nominative to form the adjective form of the possessive pronoun, like mei(nige), dei(nige), and the like.\n\n====Indefinite pronouns====\n\nJust like the possessive pronouns listed above, the indefinite pronouns ''koana'', \"none\", and ''oana'', \"one\" are inflected the same way.\n\nThere is also the indefinite pronoun ''ebba(d)'', \"someone\" with its impersonal form ''ebb(a)s'', \"something\". It is inflected in the following way:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!!!Personal!!Impersonal\n|-\n!Nominative\n|ebba||ebbs\n|-\n!Dative\n|ebbam||ebbam\n|-\n!Accusative\n|ebban||ebbs\n|}\n\n====Interrogative pronouns====\nThe interrogative pronouns ''wea'', \"who\", and ''w\u00e5s'', \"what\" are inflected the same way the indefinite pronoun ''ebba'' is inflected.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!!!Personal!!Impersonal\n|-\n!Nominative\n|wea||w\u00e5s\n|-\n!Dative\n|wem||wem\n|-\n!Accusative\n|wen||w\u00e5s\n|}\n\n== Society ==\nBavarians produce a variety of [[nicknames]] for those who bear traditional Bavarian or German names like Josef, Theresa or Georg (becoming ''Sepp'l'' or more commonly ''Sepp'', ''Resi'' and ''Schorsch'', respectively). Bavarians often refer to names with the family name coming first (like ''da Stoiber Ede'' instead of [[Edmund Stoiber]]). The use of the article is considered mandatory when using this linguistic variation. In addition, nicknames different from the family name exist for almost all families, especially in small villages. They consist largely of their profession, names or professions of deceased inhabitants of their homes or the site where their homes are located. This nickname is called ''Hausname'' (en: name of the house) and is seldom used to name the person, but more to state where they come from or live or to whom they are related. Examples of this are:\n* Mohler (e.g. ''Maler'' \u2013 painter)\n* Bachbauer (farmer who lives near a brook)\n* Moosrees (Resi who lives near a brook)\n* Schreiner (joiner)\n\n== Samples of Bavarian and Austrian ==\n\n[[File:Bavarian (Wikitongues).ogg|thumb|Spoken Bavarian]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The triangle described in the trisector theorem above, called the '''first Morley triangle''', has vertices given in [[trilinear coordinates]] relative to a triangle ''ABC'' as follows:\n\n: ''A''-vertex = 1 : 2 cos(''C''/3) : 2 cos(''B''/3)\n: ''B''-vertex = 2 cos(''C''/3) : 1 : 2 cos(''A''/3)\n: ''C''-vertex = 2 cos(''B''/3) : 2 cos(''A''/3) : 1\n\nAnother of Morley's equilateral triangles that is also a central triangle is called the '''second Morley triangle''' and is given by these vertices:\n\n: ''A-''vertex = 1 : 2 cos(''C''/3 &minus; 2\u03c0/3) : 2 cos(''B''/3 &minus; 2\u03c0/3)\n: ''B-''vertex = 2 cos(''C''/3 &minus; 2\u03c0/3) : 1 : 2 cos(''A''/3 &minus; 2\u03c0/3)\n: ''C-''vertex = 2 cos(''B''/3 &minus; 2\u03c0/3) : 2 cos(''A''/3 &minus; 2\u03c0/3) : 1\n\nThe third of Morley's 18 equilateral triangles that is also a central triangle is called the '''third Morley triangle''' and is given by these vertices:\n\n: ''A''-vertex = 1 : 2 cos(''C''/3 &minus; 4\u03c0/3) : 2 cos(''B''/3 &minus; 4\u03c0/3)\n: ''B''-vertex = 2 cos(''C''/3 &minus; 4\u03c0/3) : 1 : 2 cos(''A''/3 &minus; 4\u03c0/3)\n: ''C''-vertex = 2 cos(''B''/3 &minus; 4\u03c0/3) : 2 cos(''A''/3 &minus; 4\u03c0/3) : 1\n\nThe first, second, and third Morley triangles are pairwise [[Homothetic transformation|homothetic]].

Called the '''circumnormal triangle''', its vertices are as follows:\n\n: ''A-''vertex  = sec(''C''/3 &minus; ''B''/3) : &minus;sec(''B''/3 + 2''C''/3) : &minus;sec(''C''/3 + 2''B''/3)\n: ''B-''vertex  = &minus;sec(''A''/3 + 2''C''/3) : sec(''A''/3 &minus; ''C''/3) : &minus;sec(''C''/3 + 2''A''/3)\n: ''C-''vertex  = &minus;sec(''A''/3 + 2''B''/3) : &minus;sec(''B''/3 + 2''A''/3) : sec(''B''/3 &minus; ''A''/3)\n\nAn operation called \"extraversion\" can be used to obtain one of the 18 Morley triangles from another.

True to its historic roots, the Waldensian movement today is centred on [[Piedmont]] in [[Northern Italy]], and small communities are also found in [[Southern Italy]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]], and [[Uruguay]]. Today the two biggest Waldensian congregations are the [[Union of Waldensian and Methodist Churches]] and the Evangelical Waldensian Church of R\u00edo de la Plata.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iglesia-valdense.org/quienes-somos/|title=Quienes somos \u2013 IEVRP|language=es|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.waldensian.org/5-southamerica/|title=South America|website=www.waldensian.org|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref>\n\nThe movement originated in the late twelfth century as the Poor Men of Lyon,<ref>https://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/a-history-of-the-waldensians/</ref> a band organized by [[Peter Waldo]], a wealthy merchant who gave away his property around 1173, preaching [[apostolic poverty]] as the way to [[perfection]]. Waldensian teachings quickly came into conflict with the [[Catholic Church]]. By 1215, the Waldensians were declared [[heresy|heretical]] and subject to intense persecution; the group was [[Savoyard-Waldensian Wars|nearly annihilated in the 17th century]] and was confronted with organised and general discrimination in the centuries that followed. In the era of the [[Reformation]], the Waldensians influenced early Swiss reformer [[Heinrich Bullinger]]. Upon finding the ideas of other reformers similar to their own, they quickly merged into the larger [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movement. With the Resolutions of Chanforan on 12 September 1532, they formally became a part of the [[Calvinist]] tradition.\n\nIn the 16th century, Waldensian leaders embraced the [[Protestant Reformation]] and joined various local Protestant regional entities. As early as 1631, Protestant scholars and Waldensian theologians themselves began to regard the Waldensians as early forerunners of the Reformation, who had maintained the apostolic faith in the face of Catholic oppression. Modern Waldensians share core tenets with [[Calvinists]], including the [[priesthood of all believers]], [[congregational polity]] and a \"low\" view of certain [[sacrament]]s such as [[Eucharist|Communion]] and [[Baptism]]. They are members of the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]] and its affiliates worldwide.\n\nThe main denomination within the movement was the [[Waldensian Evangelical Church]], the original church in [[Italy]]. In 1975, it [[united and uniting churches|merged]] with the [[Methodist Evangelical Church in Italy|Methodist Evangelical Church]] to form the [[Union of Methodist and Waldensian Churches]]\u2014a majority Waldensian church, with a minority of Methodists.<ref name=\"Cesnur\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/religioni_italia/p/protestantesimo1_01.htm|title=Le religioni in Italia: Il movimento valdese|author=moreorless - www.moreorless.net|publisher=cesnur.org|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref><ref name=\"chiesavaldese3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chiesavaldese.org/pages/archivi/index_commenti.php?id=1048|title=Chiesa Evangelica Valdese \u2013 Unione delle chiese Metodiste e Valdesi|author=Consulenza sull'interfaccia e la realizzazione del codice|publisher=chiesavaldese.org|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref><ref name=\"PDF2024229388\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chiesavaldese.org/pages/archivi/mater_studio/patto_cv-ad.pdf|title=Per un patto tra la Chiesa Assemblee di Dio e la Chiesa valdese|date=20 September 2009|accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nCongregations continue to be active in Europe, South America, and North America.

There are also the two reports written for the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] by Reinerius Saccho (died 1259), a former [[Catharism|Cathar]] who converted to Catholicism, published together in 1254 as ''Summa de Catharis et Pauperibus de Lugduno'' (On the Cathars and the Poor of Lyon).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/waldo2.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Accusations against the Waldensians |publisher= Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Teachings ==\nWaldensians held and preached a number of truths as they read from the Bible. These included: \n# The atoning death and justifying righteousness of Christ;\n# The [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]];\n# The fall of man;\n# The incarnation of the Son;\n# A denial of [[purgatory]] as the \"invention of the Antichrist;\"<ref name=moreland>[https://books.google.com/books?id=c788AAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s Samuel Moreland (1658) ''History of the Evangelical Churches of the Valleys of Piedmont'']</ref> \n# The value of [[voluntary poverty]].\n\nThey also rejected a number of concepts that were widely held in Christian Europe of the era. For example, the Waldensians held that temporal offices and dignities were not meant for preachers of the Gospel; that [[relics]] were no different from any other bones and should not be regarded as special or holy; that [[pilgrimage]] served only to spend one's money; that flesh might be eaten any day if one's appetite served one; that [[holy water]] was no more efficacious than rain water; and that prayer was just as effectual if offered in a church or a barn. They were accused, moreover, of having scoffed at the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]], and of having spoken blasphemously of the Catholic Church as the [[Whore of Babylon|harlot of the Apocalypse]].<ref>Inquisitor Reyenerious, AD 1250, and extracted by Allix (Chap. 22)</ref> They rejected what they perceived as the idolatry of the Catholic Church and considered the Papacy as the Antichrist of Rome.<ref>{{cite book | title = Historical Studies | first = Eugene | last = Lawrence | year = 1876 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/historicalstudie00lawr/page/202 202]\u2013204 | url = https://archive.org/details/historicalstudie00lawr}}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[La nobla leyczon]]\" (\"the noble lesson\"), written in the [[Occitan]] language, gives a sample of the medieval Waldensian belief. It was believed that this poem dated between 1190 and 1240,<ref>Bosio, Enrico: La Nobla Leyczon ''consid\u00e9r\u00e9e au point de vue de la doctrine, de la morale et de l'histoire'', Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Histoire Vaudoise, n\u00b0 2 (dic.{{nbsp}}1885), pp.{{nbsp}}20\u201336.</ref> but there is evidence that it was written in the first part of the fifteenth century.<ref>Montet, Edouard, La noble le\u00e7on, texte original d'apr\u00e8s le manuscrit de Cambridge, 1888, pp.{{nbsp}}19\u201326.</ref> The poem exists in four manuscripts: two are housed at University of Cambridge, one at Trinity College in Dublin, and another in Geneva.<ref>Montet, Edouard, La noble le\u00e7on, texte original d'apr\u00e8s le manuscrit de Cambridge, 1888, p.{{nbsp}}19.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nAccording to legend, Peter Waldo renounced his wealth as an encumbrance to preaching,<ref>Liber visionum et miraculorum, Anonymous Chronicles of Lyon</ref> which led other members of the Catholic clergy to follow his example. Because of this shunning of wealth, the movement was early known as The Poor of Lyon and The Poor of Lombardy. <ref>TOURN Giorgio, Les Vaudois, l\u2019\u00e9tonnante aventure d\u2019un peuple-\u00e9glise, Claudiana, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe Waldensian movement was characterized from the beginning by lay preaching, voluntary poverty, and strict adherence to the Bible. Between 1175 and 1185, Waldo either commissioned a cleric from Lyon to translate the New Testament into the vernacular\u2014the [[Arpitan]] (Franco-Proven\u00e7al) language <ref>HARRIS, M. Roy.

They had to explain their faith before a panel of three clergymen, including issues that were then debated within the Church, such as the universal priesthood, the gospel in the vulgar tongue, and the issue of voluntary poverty. The results of the meeting were inconclusive, and the [[Third Lateran Council]] in the same year condemned Waldo's ideas, but not the movement itself; the leaders of the movement had not yet been [[excommunication|excommunicated]].<ref name=\"CE\">{{cite web|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15527b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: 'Waldenses' |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= 1 October 1912 |accessdate= 26 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Waldensians proceeded to disobey the Third Lateran Council and continued to preach according to their own understanding of the Scriptures. By the early 1180s, Waldo and his followers were excommunicated and forced from Lyon. The [[Catholic Church]] declared them [[heresy|heretics]], stating that the group's principal error was contempt for [[ecclesiastical]] power. Rome also accused the Waldensians of teaching innumerable errors.<ref>Rosalind B. Brooke (1975) ''The Coming of the Friars'', pp.{{nbsp}}72\u201373 (NY: Barnes and Noble)</ref>\n\nWaldo and his followers developed a system whereby they would go from town to town and meet secretly with small groups of Waldensians. There they would confess sins and hold service. A traveling Waldensian preacher was known as a ''barba''. The group would shelter the ''barba'' and help make arrangements to move on to the next town in secret.<ref>Comba, Emilio (1978) ''History of the Waldenses of Italy, from their origin to the Reformation'', AMS Press, New York {{ISBN|978-0-4041-6119-4}}</ref> Waldo possibly died in the early 13th{{nbsp}}century, possibly in Germany; he was never captured, and his fate remains uncertain.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/pastj/gtl004 | jstor = 4125197 | issn = 0031-2746 | volume = 192 | pages = 3\u201333 | last = Biller | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Biller |title = Goodbye to Waldensianism? | journal = Past & Present | accessdate = 24 March 2014 | date = August 2006| url = http://past.oxfordjournals.org/content/192/1/3 }}</ref>\n\nEarly Waldensians belonged to one of three groups:<ref name=\"herberman\">Herbermann, Charles George (1913) ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', p.{{nbsp}}250.

At a meeting held in 1526 in Laus, a town in the Chisone valley, it was decided to send envoys to examine the new movement. In 1532, they met with German and Swiss Protestants and ultimately adapted their beliefs to those of the Reformed Church.\n\nThe Swiss and French Reformed churches sent [[William Farel]] and [[Anthony Saunier]] to attend the meeting of Chanforan, which convened on 12{{nbsp}}October 1532. Farel invited them to join the Reformation and to emerge from secrecy. A Confession of Faith, with Reformed doctrines, was formulated and the Waldensians decided to worship openly in French.\n\nThe French Bible, translated by [[Pierre Robert Oliv\u00e9tan]] with the help of [[John Calvin|Calvin]] and published at [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] in 1535, was based in part on a New Testament in the Waldensian vernacular.

Prisoners were released and fugitives permitted to return home, but despite this treaty, the Vaudois, with the other French Protestants, still suffered during the [[French Wars of Religion]] in 1562\u20131598.\n\nAs early as 1631, Protestant scholars began to regard the Waldensians as early forerunners of the Reformation, in a manner similar to the way the followers of [[John Wycliffe]] and [[Jan Hus]], also persecuted by authorities, were viewed.\n\nAlthough the Waldensian church was granted some rights and freedoms under French King Henry{{nbsp}}IV, with the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598, persecution rose again in the 17th{{nbsp}}century, with an extermination of the Waldensians attempted by the Duke of Savoy in 1655.

Being in the midst of winter, the order was intended to persuade the Vaudois to choose the former; however, the bulk of the populace instead chose the latter, abandoning their homes and lands in the lower valleys and removing to the upper valleys. It was written that these targets of persecution, including old men, women, little children and the sick \"waded through the icy waters, climbed the frozen peaks, and at length reached the homes of their impoverished brethren of the upper Valleys, where they were warmly received.\"<ref name=\"McCabe1874\">{{cite book|author=James Dabney McCabe|title=Cross and crown: or, The sufferings and triumphs of the heroic men and women who were persecuted for the religion of Jesus Christ|url=https://archive.org/details/crosscrownorsuf00mcca|accessdate=16 November 2018|year=1874|publisher=National Pub.

Under the guise of false reports of Vaudois uprisings, the Duke sent troops into the upper valleys to quell the local populace. He required that the local populace quarter the troops in their homes, which the local populace complied with. But the quartering order was a ruse to allow the troops easy access to the populace. On 24{{nbsp}}April 1655, at 4{{nbsp}}a.m., the signal was given for a general massacre.\n\n[[File:AnnaCharboniereTortured.jpg|thumb|Print illustrating the 1655 massacre in La Torre, from [[Samuel Moreland]]'s ''History of the Evangelical Churches of the Valleys of Piedmont'', published in London in 1658]]\n\nThe Duke's forces did not simply slaughter the inhabitants. They are reported to have unleashed an unprovoked campaign of looting, rape, torture, and murder. According to one report by a Peter Lieg\u00e9:\n\n{{quote|Little children were torn from the arms of their mothers, clasped by their tiny feet, and their heads dashed against the rocks; or were held between two soldiers and their quivering limbs torn up by main force.

French troops sent into the French Waldensian areas of the Chisone and Susa Valleys in the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] forced 8,000 Vaudois to convert to Catholicism and another 3,000 to leave for Germany.\n\nIn the Piedmont, the cousin of Louis, the newly ascended [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II]], followed his uncle in removing the protection of Protestants in the [[Piedmont]]. In the renewed persecution, and in an echo of the Piedmont Easter Massacre of only three decades earlier, the Duke issued an edict on 31 January 1686 that decreed the destruction of all the Vaudois churches and that all inhabitants of the Valleys should publicly announce their error in religion within fifteen days under penalty of death and banishment. But the Vaudois remained resistant. After the fifteen days, an army of 9,000 French and Piedmontese soldiers invaded the Valleys against the estimated 2,500 Vaudois, but found that every village had organized a defense force that kept the French and Piedmontese soldiers at bay.\n\nOn 9 April, the Duke of Savoy issued a new edict, enjoining the Waldensians to put down their arms within eight days and go into exile between 21 and 23{{nbsp}}April. If able, they were free to sell their land and possessions to the highest bidder.\n\nWaldensian pastor [[Henri Arnaud (pastor)|Henri Arnaud]] (1641\u20131721), who had been driven out of the Piedmont in the earlier purges, returned from Holland. On 18 April he made a stirring appeal before an assembly at Roccapiatta, winning over the majority in favor of armed resistance. When the truce expired on 20{{nbsp}}April, the Waldensians were prepared for battle.\n\nThey put up a brave fight over the next six weeks, but by the time the Duke retired to Turin on 8 June, the war seemed decided: 2,000 Waldensians had been killed; another 2,000 had \"accepted\" the Catholic theology of the Council of Trent. Another 8,000 had been imprisoned, of which more than half would die of deliberately imposed starvation, or of sickness within six months.\n\nBut about two or three hundred Vaudois fled to the hills and began carrying out a guerilla war over the next year against the Catholic settlers who arrived to take over the Vaudois lands. These \"Invincibles\" continued their assaults until the Duke finally relented and agreed to negotiate. The \"Invincibles\" won the right for the imprisoned Vaudois to be released from prison and to be provided safe passage to Geneva. But the Duke, granting that permission on 3{{nbsp}}January 1687, required that the Vaudois leave immediately or convert to Catholicism. This edict led to some 2,800 Vaudois leaving the Piedmont for Geneva, of whom only 2,490 would survive the journey.\n\nArnaud and others now sought help of the allied European powers. He appealed to [[William III of England|William of Orange]] directly from Geneva, while others, amongst whom was the young [[Ren\u00e9 de Sauni\u00e8re de l'Hermitage|L'Hermitage]], were sent to England and other lands to canvas for support. Orange and the allies were glad of any excuse to antagonise France, whose territorial encroachments on all fronts were intolerable. The [[League of Augsburg]] was formed in 1686 under Orange, who promised support to Arnaud. In August 1689, in the midst of the wars between the League of Augsburg and France, Arnaud led 1,000 Swiss exiles, armed with modern weaponry provided by the Dutch, back to the Piedmont. Over a third of the force perished during the 130-mile trek. They successfully re-established their presence in the Piedmont and drove out the Catholic settlers, but they continued to be besieged by French and Piedmontese troops.\n\nBy 2 May 1689, with only 300 Waldensian troops remaining, and cornered on a high peak called the [[Balsiglia]], by 4,000 French troops with cannons, the final assault was delayed by storm and then by cloud cover. The French commander was so confident of completing his job the next morning that he sent a message to Paris that the Waldensian force had already been destroyed. However, when the French awoke the next morning they discovered that the Waldensians, guided by one of their number familiar with the Balsiglia, had already descended from the peak during the night and were now miles away.\n\nThe French pursued, but only a few days later a sudden change of political alliance by the Duke, from France to the League of Augsburg, ended the French pursuit of the Waldensians. The Duke agreed to defend the Waldensians and called for all other Vaudois exiles to return home to help protect the Piedmont borders against the French, in what came to be known as the \"Glorious Return\".<ref>Stephens, Prescot (1998) ''The Waldensian Story: A Study in Faith, Intolerance and Survival'', Book Guild, Lewes, Sussex {{ISBN|978-1-8577-6280-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Religious freedom after the French Revolution ===\n\n[[File:Iscrizione tempio valdese 4 novembre Roma.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Waldensian Church entrance in Rome, Italy]]\nAfter the [[French Revolution]], the Waldenses of Piedmont were assured liberty of conscience and, in 1848, the ruler of Savoy, King [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] granted them civil rights.\n\nEnjoying religious freedom, the Waldensians began migrating outside their valleys.

[[John Milton]], for example, wrote in his sonnet \"[[On the Late Massacre in Piedmont]]\" of the 1655 massacre and persecution of the Waldensians.\n\nIt was once held that the Waldenses were first taught by [[Paul the Apostle]] who visited Spain and then allegedly traveled on to the Piedmont. As the Catholic Church indulged in excesses in the time of [[Constantine the Great | Constantine]] (Roman Emperor from 306 to 337) - the account tells - the Waldenses held true to their apostolic faith of poverty and piety.

The American Waldensian Society recently marked its Centennial with a conference and celebrations in New York City.\n\nBy the 1920s most of the Waldensian churches and missions merged into the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church]] due to the cultural assimilation of the second and third generations.\n\nThe work of the American Waldensian Society continues in the United States today. The American Waldensian Society aims to foster dialogue and partnership among Waldensian Churches in Italy and South America and Christian churches within North America in order to promote a compelling vision of Waldensian Christian witness for North America. Thus, the American Waldensian Society makes public the contemporary and historic heritage to which Waldensian spirituality is committed: Tell the Story; Encourage \"Crossings\"; and Provide Financial Support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waldensian.org/2-whoweare/ |title=Who We Are |publisher=Waldensian.org |date= |accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe best known Waldensian Churches in America were in New York, Monett, Missouri and in Valdese, North Carolina.

The society allies with those who work to preserve their millennial heritage among their descendants. For example, over the course of 45{{nbsp}}years, the Old Colony Players in [[Valdese, North Carolina]], have staged ''From this Day Forward'', an outdoor drama telling the story of the Waldenses and the founding of Valdese.<ref name=\"this-day\" />\n\nThe Waldensian Presbyterian churches in the United States and the American Waldensian Society have links with the Italian-based [[Waldensian Evangelical Church]], but, unlike the South American Waldensian communities, today they are independent institutions from the European organization.\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Wappen Neuhengstett.png|thumb|Coat of arms of Le Bourcet (part of [[Althengstett]]) in W\u00fcrttemberg]] [[File:Arnaud Brunnen.JPG|thumb|Arnaud's fountain in [[Rutesheim|Perouse]] (W\u00fcrttemberg)]]\n\nSeveral thousand Waldenses fled from Italy and France to Germany. [[Henri Arnaud (pastor)|Henri Arnaud]] (1641\u20131721), pastor and leader of the Piedmont Waldensians, rescued his co-religionists from their dispersion under the persecution of [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus II]] the [[House of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]]. [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]] invited the Waldensians to his territory. When the Waldensians were exiled a second time, Arnaud accompanied them in their exile to [[\u00d6tisheim|Sch\u00f6nenberg]], and continued to act as their pastor until his death. Those who remained in Germany were soon assimilated by the State Churches (Lutheran and Reformed) and they are a part of various [[Landeskirche]]n in the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]]. The new settlers were free in their religious services, and kept holding them in French till the 19th century. The Waldensian community is often overlooked, as the [[Hugenots]] were larger in count. Henri Arnaud's home in Sch\u00f6nenberg close to [[\u00d6tisheim]] is a Museum today. A memorial plate refers to the introduction of potatoes in W\u00fcrttemberg by the Waldensians.\n\nMain parts of the Waldensian refugees found a new home in [[Darmstadt|Hessen-Darmstadt]], [[Kassel]], [[Homburg, Saarland|Homburg]], [[Nassau-Dillenburg]] and in the then Grand Duch\u00e9e [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The founded new communities in Rohrbach, Wembach und Hahn (today part of [[Ober-Ramstadt]]), Walldorf (today [[M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf]]), [[Bad Homburg]]-Dornholzhausen, Gottstreu and Gewissenruh ([[Oberweser]]), [[Charlottenberg, Germany|Charlottenberg]]. Still today, French family names (Gille, Roux, Granget, Conle, Gillardon, Common, Jourdan, Piston, Richardon, Servay, Conte, Baral, Gay, Orcellet or Salen) show the [[Savoy]]ard background.

Waldensian teachings quickly came into conflict with the [[Catholic Church]]. By 1215, the Waldensians were declared [[heresy|heretical]] and subject to intense persecution; the group was [[Savoyard-Waldensian Wars|nearly annihilated in the 17th century]] and was confronted with organised and general discrimination in the centuries that followed. In the era of the [[Reformation]], the Waldensians influenced early Swiss reformer [[Heinrich Bullinger]]. Upon finding the ideas of other reformers similar to their own, they quickly merged into the larger [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movement. With the Resolutions of Chanforan on 12 September 1532, they formally became a part of the [[Calvinist]] tradition.\n\nIn the 16th century, Waldensian leaders embraced the [[Protestant Reformation]] and joined various local Protestant regional entities. As early as 1631, Protestant scholars and Waldensian theologians themselves began to regard the Waldensians as early forerunners of the Reformation, who had maintained the apostolic faith in the face of Catholic oppression. Modern Waldensians share core tenets with [[Calvinists]], including the [[priesthood of all believers]], [[congregational polity]] and a \"low\" view of certain [[sacrament]]s such as [[Eucharist|Communion]] and [[Baptism]]. They are members of the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]] and its affiliates worldwide.\n\nThe main denomination within the movement was the [[Waldensian Evangelical Church]], the original church in [[Italy]]. In 1975, it [[united and uniting churches|merged]] with the [[Methodist Evangelical Church in Italy|Methodist Evangelical Church]] to form the [[Union of Methodist and Waldensian Churches]]\u2014a majority Waldensian church, with a minority of Methodists.<ref name=\"Cesnur\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/religioni_italia/p/protestantesimo1_01.htm|title=Le religioni in Italia: Il movimento valdese|author=moreorless - www.moreorless.net|publisher=cesnur.org|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref><ref name=\"chiesavaldese3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chiesavaldese.org/pages/archivi/index_commenti.php?id=1048|title=Chiesa Evangelica Valdese \u2013 Unione delle chiese Metodiste e Valdesi|author=Consulenza sull'interfaccia e la realizzazione del codice|publisher=chiesavaldese.org|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref><ref name=\"PDF2024229388\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chiesavaldese.org/pages/archivi/mater_studio/patto_cv-ad.pdf|title=Per un patto tra la Chiesa Assemblee di Dio e la Chiesa valdese|date=20 September 2009|accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nCongregations continue to be active in Europe, South America, and North America.

These included: \n# The atoning death and justifying righteousness of Christ;\n# The [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]];\n# The fall of man;\n# The incarnation of the Son;\n# A denial of [[purgatory]] as the \"invention of the Antichrist;\"<ref name=moreland>[https://books.google.com/books?id=c788AAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s Samuel Moreland (1658) ''History of the Evangelical Churches of the Valleys of Piedmont'']</ref> \n# The value of [[voluntary poverty]].\n\nThey also rejected a number of concepts that were widely held in Christian Europe of the era. For example, the Waldensians held that temporal offices and dignities were not meant for preachers of the Gospel; that [[relics]] were no different from any other bones and should not be regarded as special or holy; that [[pilgrimage]] served only to spend one's money; that flesh might be eaten any day if one's appetite served one; that [[holy water]] was no more efficacious than rain water; and that prayer was just as effectual if offered in a church or a barn. They were accused, moreover, of having scoffed at the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]], and of having spoken blasphemously of the Catholic Church as the [[Whore of Babylon|harlot of the Apocalypse]].<ref>Inquisitor Reyenerious, AD 1250, and extracted by Allix (Chap. 22)</ref> They rejected what they perceived as the idolatry of the Catholic Church and considered the Papacy as the Antichrist of Rome.<ref>{{cite book | title = Historical Studies | first = Eugene | last = Lawrence | year = 1876 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/historicalstudie00lawr/page/202 202]\u2013204 | url = https://archive.org/details/historicalstudie00lawr}}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[La nobla leyczon]]\" (\"the noble lesson\"), written in the [[Occitan]] language, gives a sample of the medieval Waldensian belief. It was believed that this poem dated between 1190 and 1240,<ref>Bosio, Enrico: La Nobla Leyczon ''consid\u00e9r\u00e9e au point de vue de la doctrine, de la morale et de l'histoire'', Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Histoire Vaudoise, n\u00b0 2 (dic.{{nbsp}}1885), pp.{{nbsp}}20\u201336.</ref> but there is evidence that it was written in the first part of the fifteenth century.<ref>Montet, Edouard, La noble le\u00e7on, texte original d'apr\u00e8s le manuscrit de Cambridge, 1888, pp.{{nbsp}}19\u201326.</ref> The poem exists in four manuscripts: two are housed at University of Cambridge, one at Trinity College in Dublin, and another in Geneva.<ref>Montet, Edouard, La noble le\u00e7on, texte original d'apr\u00e8s le manuscrit de Cambridge, 1888, p.{{nbsp}}19.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nAccording to legend, Peter Waldo renounced his wealth as an encumbrance to preaching,<ref>Liber visionum et miraculorum, Anonymous Chronicles of Lyon</ref> which led other members of the Catholic clergy to follow his example. Because of this shunning of wealth, the movement was early known as The Poor of Lyon and The Poor of Lombardy. <ref>TOURN Giorgio, Les Vaudois, l\u2019\u00e9tonnante aventure d\u2019un peuple-\u00e9glise, Claudiana, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe Waldensian movement was characterized from the beginning by lay preaching, voluntary poverty, and strict adherence to the Bible. Between 1175 and 1185, Waldo either commissioned a cleric from Lyon to translate the New Testament into the vernacular\u2014the [[Arpitan]] (Franco-Proven\u00e7al) language <ref>HARRIS, M. Roy.

They had to explain their faith before a panel of three clergymen, including issues that were then debated within the Church, such as the universal priesthood, the gospel in the vulgar tongue, and the issue of voluntary poverty. The results of the meeting were inconclusive, and the [[Third Lateran Council]] in the same year condemned Waldo's ideas, but not the movement itself; the leaders of the movement had not yet been [[excommunication|excommunicated]].<ref name=\"CE\">{{cite web|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15527b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: 'Waldenses' |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= 1 October 1912 |accessdate= 26 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Waldensians proceeded to disobey the Third Lateran Council and continued to preach according to their own understanding of the Scriptures. By the early 1180s, Waldo and his followers were excommunicated and forced from Lyon. The [[Catholic Church]] declared them [[heresy|heretics]], stating that the group's principal error was contempt for [[ecclesiastical]] power. Rome also accused the Waldensians of teaching innumerable errors.<ref>Rosalind B.

At a meeting held in 1526 in Laus, a town in the Chisone valley, it was decided to send envoys to examine the new movement. In 1532, they met with German and Swiss Protestants and ultimately adapted their beliefs to those of the Reformed Church.\n\nThe Swiss and French Reformed churches sent [[William Farel]] and [[Anthony Saunier]] to attend the meeting of Chanforan, which convened on 12{{nbsp}}October 1532. Farel invited them to join the Reformation and to emerge from secrecy. A Confession of Faith, with Reformed doctrines, was formulated and the Waldensians decided to worship openly in French.\n\nThe French Bible, translated by [[Pierre Robert Oliv\u00e9tan]] with the help of [[John Calvin|Calvin]] and published at [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] in 1535, was based in part on a New Testament in the Waldensian vernacular.

After they came out of seclusion and reports were made of [[sedition]] on their part, French King [[Francis I of France|Francis{{nbsp}}I]] on 1{{nbsp}}January 1545 issued the \"Arr\u00eat de M\u00e9rindol\", and assembled an army against the Waldensians of [[Provence]]. The leaders in the 1545 massacres were [[Jean Maynier d'Opp\u00e8de]], First President of the [[Parliament of Aix-en-Provence|parliament]] of [[Provence]], and the military commander [[Antoine Escalin des Aimars]], who was returning from the [[Italian Wars]] with 2,000 veterans, the ''Bandes de Pi\u00e9mont''. Deaths in the [[Massacre of M\u00e9rindol]] ranged from hundreds to thousands, depending on the estimates, and several villages were devastated.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rvEBMIIcHQkC&pg=PA405|first=R.

Prisoners were released and fugitives permitted to return home, but despite this treaty, the Vaudois, with the other French Protestants, still suffered during the [[French Wars of Religion]] in 1562\u20131598.\n\nAs early as 1631, Protestant scholars began to regard the Waldensians as early forerunners of the Reformation, in a manner similar to the way the followers of [[John Wycliffe]] and [[Jan Hus]], also persecuted by authorities, were viewed.\n\nAlthough the Waldensian church was granted some rights and freedoms under French King Henry{{nbsp}}IV, with the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598, persecution rose again in the 17th{{nbsp}}century, with an extermination of the Waldensians attempted by the Duke of Savoy in 1655. This led to the exodus and dispersion of the Waldensians to other parts of Europe and even to the Western hemisphere.\n\n==== Piedmont Easter ====\n{{main|Piedmontese Easter|Savoyard-Waldensian Wars}}\nIn January 1655, the [[Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]] commanded the Waldensians to attend Mass or remove to the upper valleys of their homeland, giving them twenty days in which to sell their lands. Being in the midst of winter, the order was intended to persuade the Vaudois to choose the former; however, the bulk of the populace instead chose the latter, abandoning their homes and lands in the lower valleys and removing to the upper valleys. It was written that these targets of persecution, including old men, women, little children and the sick \"waded through the icy waters, climbed the frozen peaks, and at length reached the homes of their impoverished brethren of the upper Valleys, where they were warmly received.\"<ref name=\"McCabe1874\">{{cite book|author=James Dabney McCabe|title=Cross and crown: or, The sufferings and triumphs of the heroic men and women who were persecuted for the religion of Jesus Christ|url=https://archive.org/details/crosscrownorsuf00mcca|accessdate=16 November 2018|year=1874|publisher=National Pub.

Under the guise of false reports of Vaudois uprisings, the Duke sent troops into the upper valleys to quell the local populace. He required that the local populace quarter the troops in their homes, which the local populace complied with. But the quartering order was a ruse to allow the troops easy access to the populace. On 24{{nbsp}}April 1655, at 4{{nbsp}}a.m., the signal was given for a general massacre.\n\n[[File:AnnaCharboniereTortured.jpg|thumb|Print illustrating the 1655 massacre in La Torre, from [[Samuel Moreland]]'s ''History of the Evangelical Churches of the Valleys of Piedmont'', published in London in 1658]]\n\nThe Duke's forces did not simply slaughter the inhabitants. They are reported to have unleashed an unprovoked campaign of looting, rape, torture, and murder. According to one report by a Peter Lieg\u00e9:\n\n{{quote|Little children were torn from the arms of their mothers, clasped by their tiny feet, and their heads dashed against the rocks; or were held between two soldiers and their quivering limbs torn up by main force.

Some had their hands and arms and legs lopped off, and fire applied to the severed parts to staunch the bleeding and prolong their suffering. Some were flayed alive, some were roasted alive, some disemboweled; or tied to trees in their own orchards, and their hearts cut out. Some were horribly mutilated, and of others the brains were boiled and eaten by these cannibals. Some were fastened down into the furrows of their own fields, and ploughed into the soil as men plough manure into it. Others were buried alive.

An estimate of some 1,700 Waldensians were slaughtered; the massacre was so brutal it aroused indignation throughout Europe. Protestant rulers in northern Europe offered sanctuary to the remaining Waldensians. [[Oliver Cromwell]], then ruler in England, began petitioning on behalf of the Waldensians; writing letters, raising contributions, calling a general fast in England and threatening to send military forces to the rescue. The massacre prompted [[John Milton]]'s poem on the Waldenses, \"[[On the Late Massacre in Piedmont]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/sonnets/sonnet_18/index.shtml |title=Milton: Sonnet 18 |publisher=Dartmouth.edu |date= |accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref> Swiss and Dutch Calvinists set up an \"underground railroad\" to bring many of the survivors north to Switzerland and even as far as the Dutch Republic, where the councillors of the city of Amsterdam chartered three ships to take some 167 Waldensians to their City Colony in the New World (Delaware) on Christmas Day 1656.<ref>Scharf, Thomas J.

French troops sent into the French Waldensian areas of the Chisone and Susa Valleys in the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] forced 8,000 Vaudois to convert to Catholicism and another 3,000 to leave for Germany.\n\nIn the Piedmont, the cousin of Louis, the newly ascended [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II]], followed his uncle in removing the protection of Protestants in the [[Piedmont]]. In the renewed persecution, and in an echo of the Piedmont Easter Massacre of only three decades earlier, the Duke issued an edict on 31 January 1686 that decreed the destruction of all the Vaudois churches and that all inhabitants of the Valleys should publicly announce their error in religion within fifteen days under penalty of death and banishment. But the Vaudois remained resistant. After the fifteen days, an army of 9,000 French and Piedmontese soldiers invaded the Valleys against the estimated 2,500 Vaudois, but found that every village had organized a defense force that kept the French and Piedmontese soldiers at bay.\n\nOn 9 April, the Duke of Savoy issued a new edict, enjoining the Waldensians to put down their arms within eight days and go into exile between 21 and 23{{nbsp}}April. If able, they were free to sell their land and possessions to the highest bidder.\n\nWaldensian pastor [[Henri Arnaud (pastor)|Henri Arnaud]] (1641\u20131721), who had been driven out of the Piedmont in the earlier purges, returned from Holland. On 18 April he made a stirring appeal before an assembly at Roccapiatta, winning over the majority in favor of armed resistance. When the truce expired on 20{{nbsp}}April, the Waldensians were prepared for battle.\n\nThey put up a brave fight over the next six weeks, but by the time the Duke retired to Turin on 8 June, the war seemed decided: 2,000 Waldensians had been killed; another 2,000 had \"accepted\" the Catholic theology of the Council of Trent. Another 8,000 had been imprisoned, of which more than half would die of deliberately imposed starvation, or of sickness within six months.\n\nBut about two or three hundred Vaudois fled to the hills and began carrying out a guerilla war over the next year against the Catholic settlers who arrived to take over the Vaudois lands. These \"Invincibles\" continued their assaults until the Duke finally relented and agreed to negotiate. The \"Invincibles\" won the right for the imprisoned Vaudois to be released from prison and to be provided safe passage to Geneva. But the Duke, granting that permission on 3{{nbsp}}January 1687, required that the Vaudois leave immediately or convert to Catholicism. This edict led to some 2,800 Vaudois leaving the Piedmont for Geneva, of whom only 2,490 would survive the journey.\n\nArnaud and others now sought help of the allied European powers. He appealed to [[William III of England|William of Orange]] directly from Geneva, while others, amongst whom was the young [[Ren\u00e9 de Sauni\u00e8re de l'Hermitage|L'Hermitage]], were sent to England and other lands to canvas for support. Orange and the allies were glad of any excuse to antagonise France, whose territorial encroachments on all fronts were intolerable. The [[League of Augsburg]] was formed in 1686 under Orange, who promised support to Arnaud. In August 1689, in the midst of the wars between the League of Augsburg and France, Arnaud led 1,000 Swiss exiles, armed with modern weaponry provided by the Dutch, back to the Piedmont. Over a third of the force perished during the 130-mile trek. They successfully re-established their presence in the Piedmont and drove out the Catholic settlers, but they continued to be besieged by French and Piedmontese troops.\n\nBy 2 May 1689, with only 300 Waldensian troops remaining, and cornered on a high peak called the [[Balsiglia]], by 4,000 French troops with cannons, the final assault was delayed by storm and then by cloud cover. The French commander was so confident of completing his job the next morning that he sent a message to Paris that the Waldensian force had already been destroyed. However, when the French awoke the next morning they discovered that the Waldensians, guided by one of their number familiar with the Balsiglia, had already descended from the peak during the night and were now miles away.\n\nThe French pursued, but only a few days later a sudden change of political alliance by the Duke, from France to the League of Augsburg, ended the French pursuit of the Waldensians. The Duke agreed to defend the Waldensians and called for all other Vaudois exiles to return home to help protect the Piedmont borders against the French, in what came to be known as the \"Glorious Return\".<ref>Stephens, Prescot (1998) ''The Waldensian Story: A Study in Faith, Intolerance and Survival'', Book Guild, Lewes, Sussex {{ISBN|978-1-8577-6280-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Religious freedom after the French Revolution ===\n\n[[File:Iscrizione tempio valdese 4 novembre Roma.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Waldensian Church entrance in Rome, Italy]]\nAfter the [[French Revolution]], the Waldenses of Piedmont were assured liberty of conscience and, in 1848, the ruler of Savoy, King [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] granted them civil rights.\n\nEnjoying religious freedom, the Waldensians began migrating outside their valleys.

The contemporary and historic Waldensian spiritual heritage describes itself as proclaiming the Gospel, serving the marginalized, promoting social justice, fostering inter-religious work, and advocating respect for religious diversity and freedom of conscience.<ref name=\"waldensian.org\" /> Today, the Waldensian Church is member of the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]], the [[World Methodist Council]], the [[Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy]], and the [[World Council of Churches]].\n\n== Appraisal by Protestants ==\n{{Protestantism}}\nSome early Protestants felt a spiritual kinship to the Waldensians and wrote positively about them. [[John Milton]], for example, wrote in his sonnet \"[[On the Late Massacre in Piedmont]]\" of the 1655 massacre and persecution of the Waldensians.\n\nIt was once held that the Waldenses were first taught by [[Paul the Apostle]] who visited Spain and then allegedly traveled on to the Piedmont. As the Catholic Church indulged in excesses in the time of [[Constantine the Great | Constantine]] (Roman Emperor from 306 to 337) - the account tells - the Waldenses held true to their apostolic faith of poverty and piety.

The American Waldensian Society recently marked its Centennial with a conference and celebrations in New York City.\n\nBy the 1920s most of the Waldensian churches and missions merged into the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church]] due to the cultural assimilation of the second and third generations.\n\nThe work of the American Waldensian Society continues in the United States today. The American Waldensian Society aims to foster dialogue and partnership among Waldensian Churches in Italy and South America and Christian churches within North America in order to promote a compelling vision of Waldensian Christian witness for North America. Thus, the American Waldensian Society makes public the contemporary and historic heritage to which Waldensian spirituality is committed: Tell the Story; Encourage \"Crossings\"; and Provide Financial Support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waldensian.org/2-whoweare/ |title=Who We Are |publisher=Waldensian.org |date= |accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe best known Waldensian Churches in America were in New York, Monett, Missouri and in Valdese, North Carolina. The church in New York City was disbanded by the mid-1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/medny/halsall6.html |title=Medieval New York: Waldensians in New York City |publisher=Fordham.edu |date=3 May 1998 |accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe American Waldensian Society assists churches, organizations and families in the promotion of Waldensian history and culture. The society allies with those who work to preserve their millennial heritage among their descendants. For example, over the course of 45{{nbsp}}years, the Old Colony Players in [[Valdese, North Carolina]], have staged ''From this Day Forward'', an outdoor drama telling the story of the Waldenses and the founding of Valdese.<ref name=\"this-day\" />\n\nThe Waldensian Presbyterian churches in the United States and the American Waldensian Society have links with the Italian-based [[Waldensian Evangelical Church]], but, unlike the South American Waldensian communities, today they are independent institutions from the European organization.\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Wappen Neuhengstett.png|thumb|Coat of arms of Le Bourcet (part of [[Althengstett]]) in W\u00fcrttemberg]] [[File:Arnaud Brunnen.JPG|thumb|Arnaud's fountain in [[Rutesheim|Perouse]] (W\u00fcrttemberg)]]\n\nSeveral thousand Waldenses fled from Italy and France to Germany. [[Henri Arnaud (pastor)|Henri Arnaud]] (1641\u20131721), pastor and leader of the Piedmont Waldensians, rescued his co-religionists from their dispersion under the persecution of [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus II]] the [[House of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]]. [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]] invited the Waldensians to his territory. When the Waldensians were exiled a second time, Arnaud accompanied them in their exile to [[\u00d6tisheim|Sch\u00f6nenberg]], and continued to act as their pastor until his death. Those who remained in Germany were soon assimilated by the State Churches (Lutheran and Reformed) and they are a part of various [[Landeskirche]]n in the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]]. The new settlers were free in their religious services, and kept holding them in French till the 19th century. The Waldensian community is often overlooked, as the [[Hugenots]] were larger in count. Henri Arnaud's home in Sch\u00f6nenberg close to [[\u00d6tisheim]] is a Museum today. A memorial plate refers to the introduction of potatoes in W\u00fcrttemberg by the Waldensians.\n\nMain parts of the Waldensian refugees found a new home in [[Darmstadt|Hessen-Darmstadt]], [[Kassel]], [[Homburg, Saarland|Homburg]], [[Nassau-Dillenburg]] and in the then Grand Duch\u00e9e [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The founded new communities in Rohrbach, Wembach und Hahn (today part of [[Ober-Ramstadt]]), Walldorf (today [[M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf]]), [[Bad Homburg]]-Dornholzhausen, Gottstreu and Gewissenruh ([[Oberweser]]), [[Charlottenberg, Germany|Charlottenberg]]. Still today, French family names (Gille, Roux, Granget, Conle, Gillardon, Common, Jourdan, Piston, Richardon, Servay, Conte, Baral, Gay, Orcellet or Salen) show the [[Savoy]]ard background. Stuttgart hosts as well an Italian Waldensian community with about 100 members.\n\nMunicipality names like Pinache, Serres (both now part of [[Wiernsheim]]), Gro\u00dfvillars, [[Kleinvillars]] (part of [[Oberderdingen]]), [[Rutesheim|Perouse]] show the French heritage, the latter communities are close to [[Maulbronn]] and its UNESCO world heritage site monastery and school.
