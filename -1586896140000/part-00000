Burundi gained its independence from Belgium in 1962, and in [[Burundian legislative election, 1965|May 1965 the first post-independence elections]] were held. The Hutu candidates scored a landslide victory, capturing 23 seats out of a total 33. But, instead of appointing a Hutu prime minister, the king [[Mwambutsa IV]] appointed a Tutsi prince, [[L\u00e9opold Biha]], as Prime Minister. On October 18, 1965, Hutus, angry with the king's decision, attempted a [[1965 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]. The king fled the country, but the coup ultimately failed. <!-- needs something here on the numbers killed -->{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}<!--citation needed for all the information in the paragraph-->\n\nYears later, the weeks approaching April 29 in 1972 were rustling with political interest from the events related to the return of the former king, [[Ntare V]]. From complex of elements agitated with Byzantine intrigues, Ntare went to [[Uganda]] first. Uganda\u2019s president, [[Idi Amin]], claimed he received a written guarantee from president Micombero that Ntare could return to Burundi and live there as a private citizen. Using the helicopter at his disposal from the Uganda chief of state, Ntare arrived where he and his ancestors had ruled as kings, in March 1972.  Within a few hours he was put under house arrest in the former palace in [[Gitega]]. Soon after, an official radio broadcast proclaimed that Ntare was trying to instigate a mercenary invasion of Burundi to take back rule. Some ministers favored that he would be kept under restricted protection in Gitega, while others wanted him dead. The situation was unofficially resolved when Ntare was assassinated sometime between Saturday evening, April 29, and the following morning, under circumstances which are still unclear. Whether there was a conspiracy or his death was involved with a violent outbreak in Gitega has not been determined.<ref>{{cite book|last=Melady|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Patrick Melady|title=Burundi: The Tragic years|year=1974|publisher=[[Orbis Books]]|location=New York|isbn=0-88344-045-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/burunditragicyea0000mela/page/5 5\u20136]|url=https://archive.org/details/burunditragicyea0000mela/page/5}}</ref>\n\n==The genocides==\n\n===1972===\n{{main|Ikiza}}\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan]] -->\n\n===Initial violence preceding '72 killings===\n\nOn April 27, 1972, a rebellion led by some Hutu members of the gendarmerie broke out in the lakeside towns of [[Rumonge]] and [[Nyanza-Lac]] declaring the establishment of the [[Martyazo|Martyazo Republic]].<ref>Lemarchand (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=T8W6RfqiYf0C&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&source=web&ots=9TYnc8BD1i&sig=8qJGeH5ZkDlpOB-Hlf-UD2zXlKs&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result p. 89]</ref><ref>Lemarchand, (2008).

On the eve of the outbreak of the revolt, on April 29, 1972, the fifth monarch of Burundi, Natara V, returned for the first time from the exile of six years in Europe because he thought that at that time he would be of use. That same night he was executed in his palace by order of the president. The next day, on April 30, a group of senior officers of Tutsi-Himba, who had been close to the president, began to plan the extermination of all the Hutu in Burundi. After the outbreak of the revolt, the President ordered the extension of the powers of Foreign Minister Simbania, and he was appointed Minister of the Interior. On May 12, Minister Simnaya gave a \"free hand\" to the extremist youth movement of the Tutsi known as the Revolutionary Youth Brigades (Jeunesses R\u00e9volutionnaires Rwagasore or the JRR). All members of the Hutu youth movement were exterminated on the same day. The leaders of the youth movement were instructed to submit to the army lists of all Hutu students in schools and universities.<ref>Rene Lamershend, The Killings in Burundi in 1972, 2008</ref>\n\nThe Hutu revolt was defeated within a few days in early May. Once the revolt was over, the organized extermination of Hutu citizens began in Burundi. First they ordered the army and police commanders to kill all their Hutu members, causing 750 soldiers and about 300 policemen to be killed. Next to be killed were teachers and students in high schools and vocational schools. Trucks and military vehicles arrived at schools and soldiers ordered Hutu students and teachers to board trucks, which led them to death pits, prisons, and military installations where they were executed. Members of the JRR also participated in executions and massacres and served as a qualitative force to identify the victims. Even elementary schools had soldiers targeting them; at first they gathered only the teachers but eventually even the students were killed. In June it was reported that no Hutu teachers remained. In secondary schools and elementary schools, only 45% remained. Thousands of students were kidnapped from high schools and universities and executed. In the city of Bujumbura alone, 4,000 students were loaded onto trucks and taken to death pits.<ref>Lemarchand, Ren\u00e9 (2009). The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa.

They were trying to make a Hutu-dominated republic and get rid of the Tutsis.  The Hutu government states there were about 50,000 deaths, the majority being Tutsis. However, most observers of the event believe that the figure of 50,000 is greatly exaggerated. Observers also concluded evidence that there was an attempt of Hutu elements to overthrow the government of Micombero. There were about 4-5 thousand Hutus involved in this attack. They did not have a count, but an estimated 3,000 Tutsis killed within the first week. There is no evidence that Mulelists were involved with the violence but Mulelist signs, garb, and chants were used. This was part of a historical pattern of majority group resenting domination by a minority.<ref>{{cite book|last=Melady|first=Thomas|title=Burundi: The tragic years|year=1974|publisher=Orbis Books|location=New York|isbn=0-88344-045-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/burunditragicyea0000mela/page/11 11\u201312]|url=https://archive.org/details/burunditragicyea0000mela/page/11}}</ref>\n\n====Foreign aid during the '72 violence====\nBurundi was declared to be a disaster area on May 1.

The next three years consisted of war between the Hutu government and the invading forces known as the [[Rwanda Patriotic Front]].\nIn 1993 [[Diplomat|emissaries]] from the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization of African Unity]] ([[OAU]]) made a peace agreement. A ceasefire was in effect from then on until April 6. On April 6, 1994, the presidents of both Burundi and Rwanda were returning to the Rwandan capital of [[Kigali]] with other regional leaders from peace talks in Tanzania.  The Rwandan president was under strong international pressure to implement the 1993 peace agreement.\n\n====Ethnic polarization escalates in Burundi during the 1990s====\nIn June 1993 in Burundi, the Hutu Party, {{lang|fr|Front pour la D\u00e9mocratie au Burundi}}, [[FRODEBU]], and its presidential candidate, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], won the election and formed the first Hutu government in the country.

Tens of thousands of Hutu civilians fled the country during the violence into their northern neighbor: Rwanda. The increased tensions in Burundi and Rwanda sparked episodes of civil and cross-border violence in Burundi. These precipitated large-scale killings by both sides of the conflict. These episodes further radicalized elements of the Hutu population in Rwanda, who also faced pressure from a militant Tutsi opposition, [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]]. In 1994, the Hutus led a [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] against the Tutsi in Rwanda.

Burundi gained its independence from Belgium in 1962, and in [[Burundian legislative election, 1965|May 1965 the first post-independence elections]] were held. The Hutu candidates scored a landslide victory, capturing 23 seats out of a total 33. But, instead of appointing a Hutu prime minister, the king [[Mwambutsa IV]] appointed a Tutsi prince, [[L\u00e9opold Biha]], as Prime Minister. On October 18, 1965, Hutus, angry with the king's decision, attempted a [[1965 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]. The king fled the country, but the coup ultimately failed. <!-- needs something here on the numbers killed -->{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}<!--citation needed for all the information in the paragraph-->\n\nYears later, the weeks approaching April 29 in 1972 were rustling with political interest from the events related to the return of the former king, [[Ntare V]]. From complex of elements agitated with Byzantine intrigues, Ntare went to [[Uganda]] first. Uganda\u2019s president, [[Idi Amin]], claimed he received a written guarantee from president Micombero that Ntare could return to Burundi and live there as a private citizen. Using the helicopter at his disposal from the Uganda chief of state, Ntare arrived where he and his ancestors had ruled as kings, in March 1972.  Within a few hours he was put under house arrest in the former palace in [[Gitega]]. Soon after, an official radio broadcast proclaimed that Ntare was trying to instigate a mercenary invasion of Burundi to take back rule. Some ministers favored that he would be kept under restricted protection in Gitega, while others wanted him dead. The situation was unofficially resolved when Ntare was assassinated sometime between Saturday evening, April 29, and the following morning, under circumstances which are still unclear. Whether there was a conspiracy or his death was involved with a violent outbreak in Gitega has not been determined.<ref>{{cite book|last=Melady|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Patrick Melady|title=Burundi: The Tragic years|year=1974|publisher=[[Orbis Books]]|location=New York|isbn=0-88344-045-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/burunditragicyea0000mela/page/5 5\u20136]|url=https://archive.org/details/burunditragicyea0000mela/page/5}}</ref>\n\n==The genocides==\n\n===1972===\n{{main|Ikiza}}\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan]] -->\n\n===Initial violence preceding '72 killings===\n\nOn April 27, 1972, a rebellion led by some Hutu members of the gendarmerie broke out in the lakeside towns of [[Rumonge]] and [[Nyanza-Lac]] declaring the establishment of the [[Martyazo|Martyazo Republic]].<ref>Lemarchand (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=T8W6RfqiYf0C&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&source=web&ots=9TYnc8BD1i&sig=8qJGeH5ZkDlpOB-Hlf-UD2zXlKs&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result p. 89]</ref><ref>Lemarchand, (2008).

On the eve of the outbreak of the revolt, on April 29, 1972, the fifth monarch of Burundi, Natara V, returned for the first time from the exile of six years in Europe because he thought that at that time he would be of use. That same night he was executed in his palace by order of the president. The next day, on April 30, a group of senior officers of Tutsi-Himba, who had been close to the president, began to plan the extermination of all the Hutu in Burundi. After the outbreak of the revolt, the President ordered the extension of the powers of Foreign Minister Simbania, and he was appointed Minister of the Interior. On May 12, Minister Simnaya gave a \"free hand\" to the extremist youth movement of the Tutsi known as the The Revolutionary Youth Brigades (Jeunesses R\u00e9volutionnaires Rwagasore or the JRR). All members of the Hutu youth movement were exterminated on the same day. The leaders of the youth movement were instructed to submit to the army lists of all Hutu students in schools and universities.<ref>Rene Lamershend, The Killings in Burundi in 1972, 2008</ref>\n\nThe Hutu revolt was defeated within a few days in early May. Once the revolt was over, the organized extermination of Hutu citizens began in Burundi. First they ordered the army and police commanders to kill all their Hutu members, causing 750 soldiers and about 300 policemen to be killed. Next to be killed were teachers and students in high schools and vocational schools. Trucks and military vehicles arrived at schools and soldiers ordered Hutu students and teachers to board trucks, which led them to death pits, prisons, and military installations where they were executed. Members of the JRR also participated in executions and massacres and served as a qualitative force to identify the victims. Even elementary schools had soldiers targeting them; at first they gathered only the teachers but eventually even the students were killed. In June it was reported that no Hutu teachers remained. In secondary schools and elementary schools, only 45% remained. Thousands of students were kidnapped from high schools and universities and executed. In the city of Bujumbura alone, 4,000 students were loaded onto trucks and taken to death pits.<ref>Lemarchand, Ren\u00e9 (2009). The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa.

However, most observers of the event believe that the figure of 50,000 is greatly exaggerated. Observers also concluded evidence that there was an attempt of Hutu elements to overthrow the government of Micombero. There were about 4-5 thousand Hutus involved in this attack. They did not have a count, but an estimated 3,000 Tutsis killed within the first week. There is no evidence that Mulelists were involved with the violence but Mulelist signs, garb, and chants were used.

The next three years consisted of war between the Hutu government and the invading forces known as the [[Rwanda Patriotic Front]].\nIn 1993 [[Diplomat|emissaries]] from the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization of African Unity]] ([[OAU]]) made a peace agreement. A ceasefire was in effect from then on until April 6. On April 6, 1994, the presidents of both Burundi and Rwanda were returning to the Rwandan capital of [[Kigali]] with other regional leaders from peace talks in Tanzania.  The Rwandan president was under strong international pressure to implement the 1993 peace agreement.\n\n====Ethnic polarization escalates in Burundi during the 1990s====\nIn June 1993 in Burundi, the Hutu Party, {{lang|fr|Front pour la D\u00e9mocratie au Burundi}}, [[FRODEBU]], and its presidential candidate, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], won the election and formed the first Hutu government in the country.

Tens of thousands of Hutu civilians fled the country during the violence into their northern neighbor: Rwanda. The increased tensions in Burundi and Rwanda sparked episodes of civil and cross-border violence in Burundi. These precipitated large-scale killings by both sides of the conflict. These episodes further radicalized elements of the Hutu population in Rwanda, who also faced pressure from a militant Tutsi opposition, [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]]. In 1994, the Hutus led a [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] against the Tutsi in Rwanda.

Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices.

The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July&nbsp;22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each. If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014D or S. At the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, writes, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March&nbsp;22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May&nbsp;30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He also requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March&nbsp;11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nTo ensure a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were available only to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2 each. Dealers were unable to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} leading them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a [[time capsule]] that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nBy 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and to $100 by 1965. By 1980, they were $1,750 per set, a price that decreased thereafter.{{sfn|Bowers|p=346}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2018, lists the set for between $540 and $900, depending on condition, with individual pieces valued at a third of that.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1089}} An exceptional specimen from the Denver Mint (1936\u2013D) sold for $15,863 in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[CoinWeek]]|last=Ferguson|first=Mark|date=February 28, 2020|accessdate=February 29, 2020|url=https://coinweek.com/education/coin-grading/price-records-emerge-for-finest-cac-commemorative-half-dollars/|title=Price records emerge for finest CAC commemorative half dollars}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n==Sources==\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bowers\n  | first = Q.

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]], was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable to attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of [[coin collecting]], where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President [[Franklin D.

The Senate amended the bill and passed it without discussion or dissent.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3100|date=March 3, 1936}}</ref> As the two houses had passed versions that were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March&nbsp;5, Fulmer asked that the House adopt the Senate amendments, which it did.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3337|date=March 5, 1936}}</ref> The bill, providing for 25,000 half dollars, became law with the signature of President Roosevelt on March&nbsp;18, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n==Preparation==\nThe Sesqui-Centennial Commission selected 32-year old sculptor Abraham Wolfe Davidson of [[Clemson University|Clemson College]] to design the coin.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early>{{cite web|url=http://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/|title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar|website=Early Commemorative Coins|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> Davidson, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, had reached a deal with Clemson administrators whereby he would sculpt a statue of its founder, [[Thomas G.

Harding]] charged the CFA with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins,{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi}} and Ross wanted the CFA\"s opinion.

The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each. If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014D or S. At the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, writes, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March&nbsp;22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May&nbsp;30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He also requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March&nbsp;11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nTo ensure a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were available only to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2 each. Dealers were unable to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} leading them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a [[time capsule]] that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nBy 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and to $100 by 1965. By 1980, they were $1,750 per set, a price that decreased thereafter.{{sfn|Bowers|p=346}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2018, lists the set for between $540 and $900, depending on condition, with individual pieces valued at a third of that.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1089}} An exceptional specimen from the Denver Mint (1936\u2013D) sold for $15,863 in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[CoinWeek]]|last=Ferguson|first=Mark|date=February 28, 2020|accessdate=February 29, 2020|url=https://coinweek.com/education/coin-grading/price-records-emerge-for-finest-cac-commemorative-half-dollars/|title=Price records emerge for finest CAC commemorative half dollars}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n==Sources==\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bowers\n  | first = Q.
