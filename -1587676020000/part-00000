It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wyoming Valley]] and hosts a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] building for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]]. With a population of 77,291, it is the largest city in the [[Scranton\u2013Wilkes-Barre\u2013Hazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of about 570,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/scranton-wilkes-barre-pa-area.htm |title=Scranton, Wilkes, Barre Metro Area |publisher=Usa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The city is conventionally divided into 8 districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status. Scranton (what?) the electric city!\n\nScranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Luzerne County]] and as a [[city (Pennsylvania)|city]] on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the [[Scranton General Strike]] in 1877.\n\nPeople in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839 but the [[Wilkes-Barre]] area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.\n\nThe city's nickname \"Electric City\" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the [[Dickson Manufacturing Company]]. Six years later, the United States's first [[streetcar]]s powered only by electricity began operating in the city.<ref>http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=Pennsylvania Historical Marker Search|website=www.phmc.state.pa.us}}</ref>{{dubious| the claim is widespread, but it simply means a single line was set up as electric.|date=May 2016}} Rev.

But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The [[Knox Mine disaster]] of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 143,000 in [[1930 United States Census|1930 census]] to 88,000 in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]]. The city's economy and population stabilized in the 1980s and 1990s. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial (1776\u20131845)===\nPresent-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language \"Lackawanna\" (or ''lac-a-wa-na,'' meaning \"stream that forks\"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the [[American Revolutionary War]], as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter.\n\nIn the 1840s there would have been at least 4 mentions of the office.  They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the [[Pennamite Wars]], where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.)\n\n===Arrival of industry (1846\u20131899)===\n[[File:George Inness - The Lackawanna Valley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by [[George Inness]]'s painting ''The Lackawanna Valley'', noting [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] ]]\n[[File:Scranton-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map]] Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]], who had worked at [[Oxford Furnace]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The [[Erie Railroad]]'s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing [[Rail profile|T-rails]] for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.\n\nIn 1851, the Scrantons built the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (L&W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in [[Great Bend, Pennsylvania]]. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad).  The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.\n\nDuring this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party|Greenbacker-Labor]] Party.)\n\nIn 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.\n\nCreation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the [[Scranton General Strike]] of 1877. This was in part due to the larger [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|Great Railroad Strike]], in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor [[John Hartranft]] eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.\n\nThe nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname \"The Electric City\". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&W).\n\nAs the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]]. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.\n\nBusiness was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.\n\n===Labor history===\nGiven its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Azzarelli, Margo L. |author2=Marnie Azzarelli|title=Labor Unrest in Scranton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4LDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2016|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625856814}}</ref>  The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the [[Great Railroad Strike]], attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the [[Scranton General Strike]]. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. [[William Walker Scranton]], from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded [[Scranton Steel Company]].\n\nThe labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.\n\nThe unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader [[Terence V. Powderly]] of the [[Knights of Labor]] as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately{{dubious|Perhaps a bare majority, although the situation may have been different in Scranton.|date=May 2016}} Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 about 1880.<ref>Vincent J. Falzone, \"Terence V. Powderly: Politician and Progressive Mayor of Scranton, 1878-1884,\" ''Pennsylvania History'' 41.3 (1974): 289-309.</ref> While the Catholic Church had prohibited membership in secret organizations since the mid-18th century, by the late 1880s with the influence of Archbishop [[James Gibbons]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], it supported the Knights of Labor as representing workingmen and union organizing.\n\nThe landmark [[Coal strike of 1902]], was called by anthracite miners across the region and led by the [[United Mine Workers]] under [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]]. The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, \"the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997.

Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.\n\nIn 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], developed on [[Lake Erie]] just south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the [[Mesabi Range]] in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. \n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 377) BHL40563374 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|City Hall and Soldiers Monument, ca. 1919, from ''National Geographic Magazine'']]\n\nScranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who led the [[United Mine Workers]].\n\nThe sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the [[Scranton Surface Protection Association]], chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 \"to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\nIn 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, \"both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result\" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\n\"The case of 'Penman v. Jones' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\">[http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-takes-on-mining-cave-ins-1.1046286 Cheryl A.

The [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] and [[Dalton, Pennsylvania|Dalton]]. They could travel to [[Lake Winola]] and [[Montrose, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] using the [[Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad|Northern Electric]] Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.<ref>''The Scranton Republican,'' July 5, 1934, \"Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed\", p. 1</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]] (makers of Path\u00e9 and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records]], which continued to produce [[phonograph records]] through the end of the vinyl era.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> due to growth in the mining and [[silk]] textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from [[mining]] in the area since World War I.\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpg|Washington Ave. in 1907\nImage:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpg|Burning [[Spoil tip|culm]] dump c. 1908\nImage:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpg|Old post office in 1911\n</gallery>\n\n===Post-World War II (1946\u20131984)===\nAfter World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.\n\nThe [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice \u2013 Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |accessdate=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061533/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.\nDemand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed [[County of Lackawanna Transit System|COLTS]], which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.\n\nScranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be \"more economical\" to abandon the city than make them safe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}</ref> In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now [[McDade Park]], and another on the Scranton/[[Dickson City]] line) were closed.

It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wyoming Valley]] and hosts a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] building for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]]. With a population of 77,291, it is the largest city in the [[Scranton\u2013Wilkes-Barre\u2013Hazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of about 570,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/scranton-wilkes-barre-pa-area.htm |title=Scranton, Wilkes, Barre Metro Area |publisher=Usa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The city is conventionally divided into 8 districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status.\n\nScranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Luzerne County]] and as a [[city (Pennsylvania)|city]] on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the [[Scranton General Strike]] in 1877.\n\nPeople in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839 but the [[Wilkes-Barre]] area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.\n\nThe city's nickname \"Electric City\" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the [[Dickson Manufacturing Company]]. Six years later, the United States's first [[streetcar]]s powered only by electricity began operating in the city.<ref>http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=Pennsylvania Historical Marker Search|website=www.phmc.state.pa.us}}</ref>{{dubious| the claim is widespread, but it simply means a single line was set up as electric.|date=May 2016}} Rev.

But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The [[Knox Mine disaster]] of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 143,000 in [[1930 United States Census|1930 census]] to 88,000 in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]]. The city's economy and population stabilized in the 1980s and 1990s. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial (1776\u20131845)===\nPresent-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language \"Lackawanna\" (or ''lac-a-wa-na,'' meaning \"stream that forks\"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the [[American Revolutionary War]], as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter.\n\nIn the 1840s there would have been at least 4 mentions of the office.  They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the [[Pennamite Wars]], where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.)\n\n===Arrival of industry (1846\u20131899)===\n[[File:George Inness - The Lackawanna Valley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by [[George Inness]]'s painting ''The Lackawanna Valley'', noting [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] ]]\n[[File:Scranton-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map]] Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]], who had worked at [[Oxford Furnace]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The [[Erie Railroad]]'s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing [[Rail profile|T-rails]] for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.\n\nIn 1851, the Scrantons built the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (L&W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in [[Great Bend, Pennsylvania]]. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad).  The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.\n\nDuring this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party|Greenbacker-Labor]] Party.)\n\nIn 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.\n\nCreation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the [[Scranton General Strike]] of 1877. This was in part due to the larger [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|Great Railroad Strike]], in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor [[John Hartranft]] eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.\n\nThe nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname \"The Electric City\". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&W).\n\nAs the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]]. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.\n\nBusiness was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.\n\n===Labor history===\nGiven its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Azzarelli, Margo L. |author2=Marnie Azzarelli|title=Labor Unrest in Scranton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4LDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2016|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625856814}}</ref>  The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the [[Great Railroad Strike]], attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the [[Scranton General Strike]]. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. [[William Walker Scranton]], from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded [[Scranton Steel Company]].\n\nThe labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.\n\nThe unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader [[Terence V. Powderly]] of the [[Knights of Labor]] as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately{{dubious|Perhaps a bare majority, although the situation may have been different in Scranton.|date=May 2016}} Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 about 1880.<ref>Vincent J.

The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, \"the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997. John Mitchell is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton.\"<ref>{{cite article|author=Sarah Scinto|title=Labor leader's grave restored|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/labor-leader-s-grave-restored-1.1577236|publisher=Scranton Times-Tribune|date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Growth, prosperity and consequences (1900\u20131945)===\n[[File:D.L. & W.

Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.\n\nIn 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], developed on [[Lake Erie]] just south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the [[Mesabi Range]] in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. \n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 377) BHL40563374 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|City Hall and Soldiers Monument, ca. 1919, from ''National Geographic Magazine'']]\n\nScranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who led the [[United Mine Workers]].\n\nThe sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the [[Scranton Surface Protection Association]], chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 \"to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\nIn 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, \"both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result\" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\n\"The case of 'Penman v. Jones' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\">[http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-takes-on-mining-cave-ins-1.1046286 Cheryl A.

The [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] and [[Dalton, Pennsylvania|Dalton]]. They could travel to [[Lake Winola]] and [[Montrose, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] using the [[Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad|Northern Electric]] Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.<ref>''The Scranton Republican,'' July 5, 1934, \"Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed\", p. 1</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]] (makers of Path\u00e9 and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records]], which continued to produce [[phonograph records]] through the end of the vinyl era.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> due to growth in the mining and [[silk]] textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from [[mining]] in the area since World War I.\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpg|Washington Ave. in 1907\nImage:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpg|Burning [[Spoil tip|culm]] dump c. 1908\nImage:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpg|Old post office in 1911\n</gallery>\n\n===Post-World War II (1946\u20131984)===\nAfter World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.\n\nThe [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice \u2013 Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |accessdate=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061533/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.\nDemand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed [[County of Lackawanna Transit System|COLTS]], which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.\n\nScranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be \"more economical\" to abandon the city than make them safe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}</ref> In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now [[McDade Park]], and another on the Scranton/[[Dickson City]] line) were closed.

Its flowers were regarded as a symbol of purity in the [[Tang Dynasty]] and it was planted in the grounds of the [[Emperor]]'s [[palace]].  It is the official city flower of [[Shanghai]].\n\n== Description ==\n''Magnolia denudata'' is a rather low, rounded, thickly branched, and coarse-textured tree to {{convert|30|ft|m}} tall. The leaves are ovate, bright green, 15&nbsp;cm long and 8&nbsp;cm wide. The bark is a coarse, dark gray.

It was developed by Dutch video game development company [[Two Tribes B.V.]] and is their first published video game. The game follows a young chick, Toki Tori, and his quest to rescue his younger siblings, still in their eggs. To progress through the game, the player must pick up each egg on a level using a set number of tools, with new tools being introduced as the player progresses through the four worlds. This usually involves careful planning and creative thinking.\n\n''Toki Tori'' was later released for [[Windows Mobile]] and an enhanced [[Video game remake|remake]] was released for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] via [[WiiWare]]. In the Summer of 2009, Chillingo published another enhanced remake of the game for the [[iOS]]. In 2010, Two Tribes released a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] remake on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/38700/Toki_Tori/|title=Toki Tori on Steam|date=2010-01-27|publisher=Steam|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokitori.com/en/pc/introduction/|title=Introduction - PC - Toki Tori|date=2010-01-27|publisher=Two Tribes B.V.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119065543/http://www.tokitori.com/en/pc/introduction/|archivedate=19 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-27|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A DRM-free version of the game was released on January 2012 as part of the [[Humble Indie Bundle|Humble Bundle for Android]]. This marked a simultaneous release of the game on [[OS X]], [[Linux]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The original version of the game was re-released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Nintendo eShop|eShop]] as a [[Virtual Console]] title on 31 August 2012, and an HD remake of the game was released for the [[Wii U]] eShop on 7 November 2013.<ref name=\"WiiUrelease\"/> An updated version of ''Toki Tori'' was released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] eShop on 5 November 2015. A release for the [[Nintendo Switch]] followed on 30 March 2018.\n\n==Story==\nThe [[plot (narrative)|story]] begins in a [[chicken coop]] with many unhatched [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. All of a sudden the eggs are swept away except one that coincidentally falls out of the coop and hatches. Out of the egg comes the chicken, Toki Tori. He watches as his brothers and sisters fly towards a scary looking [[castle]]. He decides to set out on an [[adventure]] and rescue his unborn family.\n\nIn the beginning cinematic, Toki Tori is on a cliff overlooking a castle and surrounded by a forest. He begins his quest in this forest, which ends with him entering the castle. In this castle, Toki Tori learns that he has special abilities that help him locate the eggs such as [[Teleportation|telewarp]] and bridge builder from a book he finds. He also learns in the [[castle]] that his powers were most likely the reason of the eggs' [[kidnapping]]. Upon finishing the castle world, Toki Tori falls through a trap door where he lands in the sewers, infested with slugs. When he is done collecting his brethren from this world, a strong torrent of water sweeps him up and sends him to Bubble Barrage, the last area of the game. After traversing this underwater world, Toki Tori returns home with his brothers and sisters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Toki Tori for Smartphone.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The first world, Forest Falls, of Toki Tori]]\nGameplay in Toki Tori consists of using a limited number of [[tool]]s to gather up all the eggs in the [[level (computer and video games)|level]] in a single run through it in a certain amount of time. Toki Tori is given a set number of tools in the beginning of a level. The puzzles are designed around the tools so they must be used intelligently and usually using a tool incorrectly makes the level unbeatable. Enemies usually appear following a simple patrol of walking back and forth, turning when they hit an obstacle.  If they touch Toki Tori, he instantly dies, forcing the player to restart the level. Some tools are [[weapon]]s that can defeat these monsters; however, they must be used wisely to allow completion of the level. Besides the threat of monsters, a timer is constantly ticking down. If the timer reaches zero, the player must restart the level. Once the player has a clear idea of how to beat the level, however, there is usually ample time to execute the plan. There are fifteen levels in each of the four worlds, not including tutorial levels that appear when a previously unseen tool appears. Only the first ten are required to enter the next area. The other five are much more difficult and are there to add [[replay value]].\n\n===Worlds===\nThere are four worlds in Toki Tori: Forest Falls, Creepy Castle, Slime Sewers (Slime Caves in the Game Boy Color version) and Bubble Barrage. The worlds become progressively more challenging as the player progresses through them, with later levels usually only having one specific way of collecting all the eggs. The most obvious difference in the worlds and their unique enemies is simply cosmetics.  Enemies all behave in the same fashion and the goal of each world is the same: collect all the eggs in one attempt.\n\nThe biggest difference in the worlds, besides cosmetics, is how each world has a specific tool associated with it. Forest Falls is the only level above water with the Freeze-o-matic, which used incorrectly can create obstacles as it freezes enemies in place. Creepy Castle contains the Ghost Trap, usable for passing through stone walls as well as beating ghosts. Slime Sewers contains the Snail Sucker, which is the only weapon that directly removes an enemy from the map. Bubble Barrage contains the Freeze-o-matic as well. When underwater, however, the frozen enemies float up so the game considers it a separate tool. Also Bubble Barrage uniquely contains the Bubble Suit.\n\nAt the end of the ten normal worlds, the player is treated to a short cinematic of Toki Tori entering the next world either on purpose or by accident. This is used to connect the levels more directly for the sake of the story.\n\n===Tools===\nTools are Toki Tori's main method of accomplishing his goal. The game claims ten different tools, as they count Freeze-o-matic a second time when used underwater.  At the start of each level, the player is given a certain number of up to four separate tools (not including the Eyes tool). Although not officially separated, tools come in two varieties: navigation and weapons.\n\nNavigational tools help Toki Tori move around obstacles and get to higher and lower floors that would be otherwise inaccessible. For example, Toki Tori can jump half his height up and half his height forward. To cross a pit, then, he would need to fill the pit with blocks using his Crate Creator or place a platform over it with the bridge builder. Some items allow him to through walls, such as the [[Teleportation|telewarp]]. The most versatile tool is the Bubble Barrage-only Bubble Suit. It allows Toki Tori to travel one half his width/height in any of the four directions, to cross pits, climb up floors or avoid enemies. If the player has at least one use of it left, they may float indefinitely. It also can be refilled to five, ten or fifteen uses at recharge points scattered throughout most Bubble Barrage levels.\n\nWeapon tools allow Toki Tori to hinder enemies or even remove them from the level. These are especially useful as Toki Tori has no [[Health (gaming)|life bar]] so a single hit will end the current attempt. The Freeze-o-matic freezes an opponent in a block of ice which will either fall to the ground or float up to the ceiling depending on whether the level is underwater or not. In both cases, careful planning can ensure that the block of ice is a platform while poor planning can make it a road block. The Ghost Trap, when placed on stone floors, causes the floor to give way when a ghost walks on it. This doesn't destroy the ghost but can get it out of the player's way. It also allows the Ghost Trap to work as a navigational tool to get to lower floors. The Snail Sucker sucks can either suck in slugs, removing them from the level, or cause them to change directions if they aren't sucked all the way into the Snail Sucker.  The latter use does not cost one use of the Snail Sucker.\n\nOne tool that is different from the rest is the Eyes tool. This tool is available on every level and has unlimited uses.  It pauses Toki Tori and any enemies in the level, but not the timer, and allows the player to freely look at the level, controlling the camera with the directional pad, which assists in planning their path.\n\nThe Eyes tool and timer were only present in the GBC version of ''Toki Tori''.\n\n==Remakes and re-releases==\n[[AIM Productions]] published a port of the game for [[Windows Mobile]] with improved graphics and slight changes to certain [[level (computer and video games)|levels]] in 2003. In 2009, Chillingo published the game for [[iOS]] (iPhone).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://toucharcade.com/2009/04/07/chillingo-to-bring-two-tribes-toki-tori-on-iphone/|title=Chillingo to Bring Two Tribe's 'Toki Tori' on iPhone|date=2009-04-07|publisher=Touch Arcade|accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Wii version===\nAn [[Video game remake|enhanced remake]] of ''Toki Tori'' was released for the [[Wii]] via [[WiiWare]] in 2008.<ref name=remakeannouncement>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/02/toki-tori-take-2|title=Toki Tori, Take 2!|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|date=2007-10-02|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> It was a WiiWare [[Launch game|launch title]] in Europe, being released on 20 May 2008,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/05/wiiware_launches_in_europe|title=WiiWare Launches In Europe|author=Damien McFerran|website=[[Nintendo Life]]|date=2008-05-19|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> and was later released in North America on 2 June 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/06/usa_wiiware_update_protothea_and_toki_tori|author=Darren Calvert|title=USA WiiWare Update: Prot\u00f6thea And Toki Tori|website=Nintendo Life|date=2008-06-02|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe Wii remake of ''Toki Tori'' features a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] design while retaining his two dimensional scrolling gameplay, and allows players to use a control scheme that uses the [[Wii Remote]]'s pointer function to lead Toki Tori through each level.

The goal of an older brother rescuing his egg-bound siblings is maintained.  The fundamental gameplay style was also carried over from predecessor to successor. Eggbert is given a limited amount of up to three tools which must used conservatively and intelligently to gather eggs while avoiding enemies which lurk about the stages.  The character appearance of Toki Tori is the same as Eggbert, though with graphical improvements to the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]. ''Eggbert'' provided three of the four worlds for ''Toki Tori''. Many tools from ''Eggbert'' reappear in ''Toki Tori'', though some are cosmetically different: for example, Toki Tori's Freeze-o-matic works identically as Eggbert's slime gun; Eggbert's clone creator, which makes a gray, life-sized doll of Eggbert that acts both as a blockade and a platform, is functionally identical to Toki Tori's Crate Creator.\n\n[[File:Eggbert Chip Level.gif|right|thumb|200px|The Chip Level of ''Eggbert'', which was replaced by Creepy Castle in ''Toki Tori'']]\nThe changes between the two are minor, showing no drastically redesigned composition.

There is no exposition of Eggbert's abilities as there is of Toki Tori at the end of the \"Creepy Castle\" level, which replaced the predecessor's \"Chip Level\". In technical gameplay, ''Eggbert'' had shorter and simpler levels than its successor, which also added a complement of 20 \"extra-hard\" levels. The tutorial levels of ''Eggbert'' were all placed in the same optional world, as opposed to ''Toki Tori''{{'}}s mandatory tutorial levels scattered throughout the game.  A few of Eggbert's tools were omitted, including one that turned him invisible or one magnet that caused an enemy to reverse direction, though the ability of this latter tool was added to the \"Snail Sucker\" in ''Toki Tori''. An example of a tool unique to the successor is an Eye which allows Toki Tori to peer around the entire level, an ability unnecessary in ''Eggbert''.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = GBC: 80%<ref name=\"GRpage\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/gbc/468485-toki-tori/index.html |title=Toki Tori for Game Boy Color |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />iOS: 94%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/iphone/962254-toki-tori/index.html |title=Toki Tori for iOS (iPhone/iPad) |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n| MC = WII: 79/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for Wii Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />PC: 80/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />PS3: 75/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for PlayStation 3 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />3DS: 76/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/toki-tori-3d |title=Toki Tori 3D for 3DS Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />NS: 82/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for Switch Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n| GI = 7.5/10<ref name=\"GIreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200104/R03.0804.1135.40781.htm|title=Toki Tori|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=2008-01-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710195442/http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200104/R03.0804.1135.40781.htm|archivedate=10 July 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n| GamePro = 4/5<ref name=\"GPreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/gameboy_color/games/reviews/15380.shtml|title=Review: Toki Tori for Game Boy Color|publisher=[[GamePro]]|date=2001-07-17|accessdate=2008-01-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205155222/http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/gameboy_color/games/reviews/15380.shtml|archivedate=5 December 2004|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8.2/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/puzzle/tokitori/index.html?tag=result;title;0|title=Toki Tori for GBC|website=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>\n| IGN = 9/10<ref name=\"IGNreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/23/toki-tori|title=IGN: Toki Tori Review |website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|date=2001-10-23|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n| NLife = 8/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu-eshop/toki_tori|author=Marcel van Duyn|title=Review: Toki Tori (Wii U)|website=Nintendo Life|date=2013-11-15|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref><br>9/10<ref name=nintendolife/>\n| rev1 = ''Cubed3''\n| rev1Score = 8/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubed3.com/review/2454/1/toki-tori-3d-nintendo-3ds.html|title=Toki Tori 3D (Nintendo 3DS) Review|website=Cubed3|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n| award1Pub  = IGN\n| award1     = Editors' Choice Award<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/index/choice.html|title=IGN.com Editors' Choice Awards|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2008-01-04|archivedate=26 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126125211/http://gameboy.ign.com/index/choice.html|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Toki Tori'' was one of the last games released for the [[Game Boy Color]]. Some critics have attributed the interest surrounding the newly released [[Game Boy Advance]], coupled with the fact that ''Toki Tori'' was a new name in the industry as the reason it was ignored by the public at large.<ref name=remakeannouncement/> Two Tribes has also cited its release date, right after the [[9/11]] terror attacks, as a factor in its lack of finding success. \n\nReviews were generally positive from the critics, being viewed as an intelligent addition to the dying Game Boy Color system.  A ''[[GamePro]]'' writer commented how its challenging puzzles made it an enjoyable game.<ref name=\"GPreview\"/> One ''[[Game Informer]]'' reviewer called it \"thoughtful title in Game Boy Color's sea of pooped-out platformers\".<ref name=\"GIreview\"/> Besides the puzzles, critics also praised the graphics saying the game \"even fits right at home on the Game Boy Advance, looking as close to a native GBA game as any Game Boy Color title has ever come\".<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/>\n\nReviews for the WiiWare release of the game were also positive, with ''[[IGN]]'' giving the game an 8/10, saying that the gameplay holds up extremely well, with the presentation significantly better than the original Game Boy Color release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/878/878347p1.html|author=Craig Harris|title=IGN Wii: Toki Tori Review|date=2008-06-02|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2008-06-03|archivedate=3 June 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603121421/http://wii.ign.com/articles/878/878347p1.html|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''N-Europe'' highly praised the title, giving it a 9/10 and commenting that it was 'oozing with charm and held together with love'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://n-europe.com/review.php?rid=384|title=WiiWare Review: Toki Tori|publisher=N-Europe|first=Nathan|last=Whincup|date=2008-06-08|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> The WiiWare version was nominated for multiple Wii-specific awards by ''IGN'' in its 2008 video game awards, including Best WiiWare Game<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bestof.ign.com/2008/wii/20.html|title=IGN Wii: Best WiiWare Game 2008|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2008-12-19|date=2008-12-18|archivedate=22 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222040904/http://bestof.ign.com/2008/wii/20.html|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and Best Puzzle Game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/editors-choice/games?sortBy=score&sortOrder=asc&genre=puzzle&startIndex=75|title=IGN Wii: Best Puzzle Game 2008|date=2008-12-18|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n\n[[Category:2001 video games]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:Capcom games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy Color games]]\n[[Category:iOS games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch eShop games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 3 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n[[Category:Puzzle video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Video game remakes]]\n[[Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics]]\n[[Category:Virtual Console games]]\n[[Category:Wii U eShop games]]\n[[Category:WiiWare games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows Phone games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Fictional chickens]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title = Toki Tori\n|image = Toki Tori Coverart.png\n|developer = [[Two Tribes B.V.]], Haakon Keiseraas, Ole Martin Keiseraas\n|publisher = Two Tribes B.V., [[Capcom]], [[AIM Productions]], [[Chillingo]], {{vgrelease|JP|Rainy Frog}}\n|producer = Haakon Keiseraas\n|designer = Haakon Keiseraas\n|composer = Chris J.

It was developed by Dutch video game development company [[Two Tribes B.V.]] and is their first published video game. The game follows a young chick, Toki Tori, and his quest to rescue his younger siblings, still in their eggs. To progress through the game, the player must pick up each egg on a level using a set number of tools, with new tools being introduced as the player progresses through the four worlds. This usually involves careful planning and creative thinking.\n\n''Toki Tori'' was later released for [[Windows Mobile]] and an enhanced [[Video game remake|remake]] was released for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] via [[WiiWare]]. In the Summer of 2009, Chillingo published another enhanced remake of the game for the [[iOS]]. In 2010, Two Tribes released a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] remake on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/38700/Toki_Tori/|title=Toki Tori on Steam|date=2010-01-27|publisher=Steam|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokitori.com/en/pc/introduction/|title=Introduction - PC - Toki Tori|date=2010-01-27|publisher=Two Tribes B.V.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119065543/http://www.tokitori.com/en/pc/introduction/|archivedate=19 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-27|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A DRM-free version of the game was released on January 2012 as part of the [[Humble Indie Bundle|Humble Bundle for Android]]. This marked a simultaneous release of the game on [[OS X]], [[Linux]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The original version of the game was re-released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Nintendo eShop|eShop]] as a [[Virtual Console]] title on 31 August 2012, and an HD port of the game was released for the [[Wii U]] eShop on 7 November 2013.<ref name=\"WiiUrelease\"/> An updated version of ''Toki Tori'' was released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] eShop on 5 November 2015. A release for the [[Nintendo Switch]] followed on 30 March 2018.\n\n==Story==\nThe [[plot (narrative)|story]] begins in a [[chicken coop]] with many unhatched [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. All of a sudden the eggs are swept away except one that coincidentally falls out of the coop and hatches. Out of the egg comes the chicken, Toki Tori. He watches as his brothers and sisters fly towards a scary looking [[castle]]. He decides to set out on an [[adventure]] and rescue his unborn family.\n\nIn the beginning cinematic, Toki Tori is on a cliff overlooking a castle and surrounded by a forest. He begins his quest in this forest, which ends with him entering the castle. In this castle, Toki Tori learns that he has special abilities that help him locate the eggs such as [[Teleportation|telewarp]] and bridge builder from a book he finds. He also learns in the [[castle]] that his powers were most likely the reason of the eggs' [[kidnapping]]. Upon finishing the castle world, Toki Tori falls through a trap door where he lands in the sewers, infested with slugs. When he is done collecting his brethren from this world, a strong torrent of water sweeps him up and sends him to Bubble Barrage, the last area of the game. After traversing this underwater world, Toki Tori returns home with his brothers and sisters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Toki Tori for Smartphone.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The first world, Forest Falls, of Toki Tori]]\nGameplay in Toki Tori consists of using a limited number of [[tool]]s to gather up all the eggs in the [[level (computer and video games)|level]] in a single run through it in a certain amount of time. Toki Tori is given a set number of tools in the beginning of a level. The puzzles are designed around the tools so they must be used intelligently and usually using a tool incorrectly makes the level unbeatable. Enemies usually appear following a simple patrol of walking back and forth, turning when they hit an obstacle.  If they touch Toki Tori, he instantly dies, forcing the player to restart the level. Some tools are [[weapon]]s that can defeat these monsters; however, they must be used wisely to allow completion of the level. Besides the threat of monsters, a timer is constantly ticking down. If the timer reaches zero, the player must restart the level. Once the player has a clear idea of how to beat the level, however, there is usually ample time to execute the plan. There are fifteen levels in each of the four worlds, not including tutorial levels that appear when a previously unseen tool appears. Only the first ten are required to enter the next area. The other five are much more difficult and are there to add [[replay value]].\n\n===Worlds===\nThere are four worlds in Toki Tori: Forest Falls, Creepy Castle, Slime Sewers (Slime Caves in the Game Boy Color version) and Bubble Barrage. The worlds become progressively more challenging as the player progresses through them, with later levels usually only having one specific way of collecting all the eggs. The most obvious difference in the worlds and their unique enemies is simply cosmetics.  Enemies all behave in the same fashion and the goal of each world is the same: collect all the eggs in one attempt.\n\nThe biggest difference in the worlds, besides cosmetics, is how each world has a specific tool associated with it. Forest Falls is the only level above water with the Freeze-o-matic, which used incorrectly can create obstacles as it freezes enemies in place. Creepy Castle contains the Ghost Trap, usable for passing through stone walls as well as beating ghosts. Slime Sewers contains the Snail Sucker, which is the only weapon that directly removes an enemy from the map. Bubble Barrage contains the Freeze-o-matic as well. When underwater, however, the frozen enemies float up so the game considers it a separate tool. Also Bubble Barrage uniquely contains the Bubble Suit.\n\nAt the end of the ten normal worlds, the player is treated to a short cinematic of Toki Tori entering the next world either on purpose or by accident. This is used to connect the levels more directly for the sake of the story.\n\n===Tools===\nTools are Toki Tori's main method of accomplishing his goal. The game claims ten different tools, as they count Freeze-o-matic a second time when used underwater.  At the start of each level, the player is given a certain number of up to four separate tools (not including the Eyes tool). Although not officially separated, tools come in two varieties: navigation and weapons.\n\nNavigational tools help Toki Tori move around obstacles and get to higher and lower floors that would be otherwise inaccessible. For example, Toki Tori can jump half his height up and half his height forward. To cross a pit, then, he would need to fill the pit with blocks using his Crate Creator or place a platform over it with the bridge builder. Some items allow him to through walls, such as the [[Teleportation|telewarp]]. The most versatile tool is the Bubble Barrage-only Bubble Suit. It allows Toki Tori to travel one half his width/height in any of the four directions, to cross pits, climb up floors or avoid enemies. If the player has at least one use of it left, they may float indefinitely. It also can be refilled to five, ten or fifteen uses at recharge points scattered throughout most Bubble Barrage levels.\n\nWeapon tools allow Toki Tori to hinder enemies or even remove them from the level. These are especially useful as Toki Tori has no [[Health (gaming)|life bar]] so a single hit will end the current attempt. The Freeze-o-matic freezes an opponent in a block of ice which will either fall to the ground or float up to the ceiling depending on whether the level is underwater or not. In both cases, careful planning can ensure that the block of ice is a platform while poor planning can make it a road block. The Ghost Trap, when placed on stone floors, causes the floor to give way when a ghost walks on it. This doesn't destroy the ghost but can get it out of the player's way. It also allows the Ghost Trap to work as a navigational tool to get to lower floors. The Snail Sucker sucks can either suck in slugs, removing them from the level, or cause them to change directions if they aren't sucked all the way into the Snail Sucker.  The latter use does not cost one use of the Snail Sucker.\n\nOne tool that is different from the rest is the Eyes tool. This tool is available on every level and has unlimited uses.  It pauses Toki Tori and any enemies in the level, but not the timer, and allows the player to freely look at the level, controlling the camera with the directional pad, which assists in planning their path.\n\nThe Eyes tool and timer were only present in the GBC version of ''Toki Tori''.\n\n==Remakes and re-releases==\n[[AIM Productions]] published a port of the game for [[Windows Mobile]] with improved graphics and slight changes to certain [[level (computer and video games)|levels]] in 2003. In 2009, Chillingo published the game for [[iOS]] (iPhone).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://toucharcade.com/2009/04/07/chillingo-to-bring-two-tribes-toki-tori-on-iphone/|title=Chillingo to Bring Two Tribe's 'Toki Tori' on iPhone|date=2009-04-07|publisher=Touch Arcade|accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Wii version===\nAn [[Video game remake|enhanced remake]] of ''Toki Tori'' was released for the [[Wii]] via [[WiiWare]] in 2008.<ref name=remakeannouncement>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/02/toki-tori-take-2|title=Toki Tori, Take 2!|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|date=2007-10-02|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> It was a WiiWare [[Launch game|launch title]] in Europe, being released on 20 May 2008,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/05/wiiware_launches_in_europe|title=WiiWare Launches In Europe|author=Damien McFerran|website=[[Nintendo Life]]|date=2008-05-19|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> and was later released in North America on 2 June 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/06/usa_wiiware_update_protothea_and_toki_tori|author=Darren Calvert|title=USA WiiWare Update: Prot\u00f6thea And Toki Tori|website=Nintendo Life|date=2008-06-02|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe Wii remake of ''Toki Tori'' features a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] design while retaining his two dimensional scrolling gameplay, and allows players to use a control scheme that uses the [[Wii Remote]]'s pointer function to lead Toki Tori through each level.

The goal of an older brother rescuing his egg-bound siblings is maintained.  The fundamental gameplay style was also carried over from predecessor to successor. Eggbert is given a limited amount of up to three tools which must used conservatively and intelligently to gather eggs while avoiding enemies which lurk about the stages.  The character appearance of Toki Tori is the same as Eggbert, though with graphical improvements to the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]. ''Eggbert'' provided three of the four worlds for ''Toki Tori''. Many tools from ''Eggbert'' reappear in ''Toki Tori'', though some are cosmetically different: for example, Toki Tori's Freeze-o-matic works identically as Eggbert's slime gun; Eggbert's clone creator, which makes a gray, life-sized doll of Eggbert that acts both as a blockade and a platform, is functionally identical to Toki Tori's Crate Creator.\n\n[[File:Eggbert Chip Level.gif|right|thumb|200px|The Chip Level of ''Eggbert'', which was replaced by Creepy Castle in ''Toki Tori'']]\nThe changes between the two are minor, showing no drastically redesigned composition. The name change from ''Eggbert'' to ''Toki Tori'' was because a game similar in name, called [[Speedy Eggbert]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/38700/discussions/0/343785574532432957/|title=\"The fact that Speedy Eggbert exist is actually why we renamed our Eggbert to Toki Tori :)\"|date=2016-10-22|access-date=2018-01-03|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022000245/http://steamcommunity.com/app/38700/discussions/0/343785574532432957/|archivedate=22 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> had emerged and partly due to phonological aesthetic, as the [[Japanese language]] interpretation {{nihongo|'time bird'|\u6642\u9ce5|4=\u30c8\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30fb\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc}} has no pertinence to the Two Tribes design.<ref>{{cite web|last1=n.n.|first1=[http://twotribes.com/auteur/22/ Martijn]|title=Remember Toki Tori GBC?|url=http://twotribes.com/message/remember-toki-tori-gbc/|publisher=Two Tribes|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=2 August 2012|quote=Even though Toki Tori sounds Japanese, it really doesn't mean much in Japanese.

Whatever it is, it doesn't mean anything, it just sounds cool.}}</ref> The major difference between story plots is a strong wind sweeping away Toki Tori's siblings, whereas they ran away from Eggbert. There is no exposition of Eggbert's abilities as there is of Toki Tori at the end of the \"Creepy Castle\" level, which replaced the predecessor's \"Chip Level\". In technical gameplay, ''Eggbert'' had shorter and simpler levels than its successor, which also added a complement of 20 \"extra-hard\" levels. The tutorial levels of ''Eggbert'' were all placed in the same optional world, as opposed to ''Toki Tori''{{'}}s mandatory tutorial levels scattered throughout the game.  A few of Eggbert's tools were omitted, including one that turned him invisible or one magnet that caused an enemy to reverse direction, though the ability of this latter tool was added to the \"Snail Sucker\" in ''Toki Tori''. An example of a tool unique to the successor is an Eye which allows Toki Tori to peer around the entire level, an ability unnecessary in ''Eggbert''.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = GBC: 80%<ref name=\"GRpage\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/gbc/468485-toki-tori/index.html |title=Toki Tori for Game Boy Color |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />iOS: 94%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/iphone/962254-toki-tori/index.html |title=Toki Tori for iOS (iPhone/iPad) |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n| MC = WII: 79/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for Wii Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />PC: 80/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />PS3: 75/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for PlayStation 3 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />3DS: 76/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/toki-tori-3d |title=Toki Tori 3D for 3DS Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />NS: 82/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for Switch Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n| GI = 7.5/10<ref name=\"GIreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200104/R03.0804.1135.40781.htm|title=Toki Tori|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=2008-01-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710195442/http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200104/R03.0804.1135.40781.htm|archivedate=10 July 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n| GamePro = 4/5<ref name=\"GPreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/gameboy_color/games/reviews/15380.shtml|title=Review: Toki Tori for Game Boy Color|publisher=[[GamePro]]|date=2001-07-17|accessdate=2008-01-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205155222/http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/gameboy_color/games/reviews/15380.shtml|archivedate=5 December 2004|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8.2/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/puzzle/tokitori/index.html?tag=result;title;0|title=Toki Tori for GBC|website=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>\n| IGN = 9/10<ref name=\"IGNreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/23/toki-tori|title=IGN: Toki Tori Review |website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|date=2001-10-23|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n| NLife = 8/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu-eshop/toki_tori|author=Marcel van Duyn|title=Review: Toki Tori (Wii U)|website=Nintendo Life|date=2013-11-15|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref><br>9/10<ref name=nintendolife/>\n| rev1 = ''Cubed3''\n| rev1Score = 8/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubed3.com/review/2454/1/toki-tori-3d-nintendo-3ds.html|title=Toki Tori 3D (Nintendo 3DS) Review|website=Cubed3|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n| award1Pub  = IGN\n| award1     = Editors' Choice Award<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/index/choice.html|title=IGN.com Editors' Choice Awards|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2008-01-04|archivedate=26 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126125211/http://gameboy.ign.com/index/choice.html|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Toki Tori'' was one of the last games released for the [[Game Boy Color]]. Some critics have attributed the interest surrounding the newly released [[Game Boy Advance]], coupled with the fact that ''Toki Tori'' was a new name in the industry as the reason it was ignored by the public at large.<ref name=remakeannouncement/> Two Tribes has also cited its release date, right after the [[9/11]] terror attacks, as a factor in its lack of finding success. \n\nReviews were generally positive from the critics, being viewed as an intelligent addition to the dying Game Boy Color system.  A ''[[GamePro]]'' writer commented how its challenging puzzles made it an enjoyable game.<ref name=\"GPreview\"/> One ''[[Game Informer]]'' reviewer called it \"thoughtful title in Game Boy Color's sea of pooped-out platformers\".<ref name=\"GIreview\"/> Besides the puzzles, critics also praised the graphics saying the game \"even fits right at home on the Game Boy Advance, looking as close to a native GBA game as any Game Boy Color title has ever come\".<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/>\n\nReviews for the WiiWare release of the game were also positive, with ''[[IGN]]'' giving the game an 8/10, saying that the gameplay holds up extremely well, with the presentation significantly better than the original Game Boy Color release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/878/878347p1.html|author=Craig Harris|title=IGN Wii: Toki Tori Review|date=2008-06-02|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2008-06-03|archivedate=3 June 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603121421/http://wii.ign.com/articles/878/878347p1.html|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''N-Europe'' highly praised the title, giving it a 9/10 and commenting that it was 'oozing with charm and held together with love'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://n-europe.com/review.php?rid=384|title=WiiWare Review: Toki Tori|publisher=N-Europe|first=Nathan|last=Whincup|date=2008-06-08|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> The WiiWare version was nominated for multiple Wii-specific awards by ''IGN'' in its 2008 video game awards, including Best WiiWare Game<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bestof.ign.com/2008/wii/20.html|title=IGN Wii: Best WiiWare Game 2008|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2008-12-19|date=2008-12-18|archivedate=22 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222040904/http://bestof.ign.com/2008/wii/20.html|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and Best Puzzle Game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/editors-choice/games?sortBy=score&sortOrder=asc&genre=puzzle&startIndex=75|title=IGN Wii: Best Puzzle Game 2008|date=2008-12-18|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n\n[[Category:2001 video games]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:Capcom games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy Color games]]\n[[Category:iOS games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch eShop games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 3 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n[[Category:Puzzle video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Video game remakes]]\n[[Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics]]\n[[Category:Virtual Console games]]\n[[Category:Wii U eShop games]]\n[[Category:WiiWare games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows Phone games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Fictional chickens]]\n", "name_user": "Maxeto0910", "label": "safe", "comment": "Correction: It is not only a port as it contains new textures.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Tori"}
