She dominated American women's tennis before World War I, and won 45 U.S. titles during her life.\n\n==Personal life==\nWightman was born Hazel Virginia Hotchkiss in Healdsburg, California to William Joseph and Emma Lucretia (Grove) Hotchkiss. In February 1912, at the age of 25, she married George William Wightman of Boston. Her father-in-law, George Henry Wightman, was a leader in the steel industry, as an associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]], and one of the country's foremost pioneers of amateur tennis.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1937/04/21/94357643.html?pageNumber=23 |newspaper=New York Times |title=Geo.

She died at her home in the village of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts on December 5, 1974.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/12/06/87613210.html?pageNumber=42|newspaper=New York Times |date=March 6, 1974 |author=Alfred E. Clark |title=Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman Dies; Holder of Tennis Titles was 86}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Queen Elizabeth II made her an honorary [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].\n\n==Career highlights==\nWightman dominated American women's tennis before World War I and had an unparalleled reputation for sportsmanship. Wightman won a lifetime total of 45 U.S. titles, the last at age 68. She won 16 titles overall at the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]], four of them in singles (1909\u201311, 1919). Nine of her titles at the U.S. Championships came from 1909 to 1911, when she swept the singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles competitions three consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Bud|title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis|year=2010|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=[New York]|isbn=978-0942257700|edition=2nd|pages=467, 468, 479, 481}}</ref>\n\nWightman is known as the \"Queen Mother of American Tennis\" or \"Lady Tennis\" for her lifelong participation in and promotion of women's tennis and because she was instrumental in organizing the Ladies International Tennis Challenge between British and American women's teams, better known as the [[Wightman Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hall of Famers \u2013 Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman|url=http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/hazel-hotchkiss-wightman|publisher=International Tennis Hall of Fame|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> The cup first was held in 1923 and continued through 1989. She played five years on the American team and was the captain of the American team from inception of the competition through 1948. The cup was composed of five singles and two doubles matches. The cup itself was donated in 1923 by Wightman in honor of her husband. The first contest at Forest Hills, New York on August 11 and 13, 1923 was won by the United States.\n\nBorn during the early days of American tennis, Wightman was a frail and awkward child. Her doctor recommended that she take up a sport to strengthen herself. Her brother suggested tennis as it was considered a \"genteel\" sport. Wightman learned to play at the nearby courts of the University of California, Berkeley where she graduated in 1911. Her rivalry with fellow Californian, [[May Sutton]], shaped a new women's game, with Wightman attacking the net to counter Sutton's dominating forehand.<ref name=ohnsorg>{{cite book|last=Ohnsorg|first=Roger W.|title=Robert Lindley Murray: The Reluctant U.S. Tennis Champion; includes \"The First Forty Years of American Tennis\"|publisher=Trafford On Demand Pub|location=Victoria, BC|isbn=978-1-4269-4514-4|page=47}}</ref>\n\nWightman devoted herself to teaching young people, opening her home near Boston's [[Longwood Cricket Club]] to aspiring champions. In recognition of Wightman's contributions to tennis, the [[United States Tennis Association#Awards|USTA Service Bowl]] was donated in her honor. In 1973, Wightman was appointed as an honorary Commander of the [[Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Order of the British Empire]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1913&dat=19730825&id=uqMgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p2gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1056,3618634&hl=en \"You would like to be served this time\"], Lewiston Evening journal, 25 August 1973</ref><ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/wi/hazel-wightman-1.html Olympic profile of Hazel Wightman], Sports-Reference.com</ref>\n\n*17 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles (4 singles, 7 women's doubles, 6 mixed doubles)\n*Won all three titles at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911\n*Won singles title at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911, 1919\n*Runner-up in singles at the U.S. Championships: 1915\n*Won women's doubles title at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911, 1915, 1924, 1928\n*Runner-up in women's doubles at the U.S. Championships: 1919, 1923\n*Won mixed doubles title at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911, 1915, 1918, 1920\n*Runner-up in mixed doubles at the U.S. Championships: 1926\n*Won women's doubles title at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]: 1924\n*Olympic gold medalist in women's doubles and mixed doubles: 1924\n*Won singles title at the [[US Indoors|U.S. Indoor Championships]]: 1919, 1927\n*Won women's doubles title at the U.S. Indoor Championships: 1919, 1921, 1924, 1927\u20131931, 1933, 1943\n*Runner-up in women's doubles at the U.S. Indoor Championships: 1923, 1926, 1932, 1941, 1946\n*Won mixed doubles title at the U.S. Indoor Championships: 1923, 1924, 1926\u20131928\n*Won doubles title at the U.S. Grass Court Championships (for age 40 and over): 1940\u20131942, 1944, 1946\u20131950, 1952, 1954\n*U.S. Wightman Cup team member: 1923, 1924, 1927, 1929, 1931\n*U.S. Wightman Cup team captain: 1923, 1924, 1927, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1935, 1937\u20131939, 1946\u20131948\n*Winner of USTA Service Bowl, donated in Wightman's honor: 1940, 1946\n*Author of ''Better Tennis''\n*Coached several women champions, including [[Sarah Palfrey Cooke]], [[Helen Wills Moody]], and [[Helen Jacobs]]\n*Inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1957\n*Appointed as an Honorary [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1973\n*Inducted into the [[International Women's Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1986\n*First honoree in the University of California women's athlete hall of fame\n\n==Career in depth==\n[[File:Hazel Hotchkiss cropped.jpg|thumb]]\nThough short in stature, Wightman anticipated and moved extremely well around a tennis court. She perfected her volleying style early, hitting the ball against the family home in Berkeley, California, where she grew up and graduated from the University of California. She refused to let the ball bounce because the yard was so uneven. She used to play against her four brothers and then the proud and spiky Sutton sisters.\n\nWightman was a shy, somewhat awed, and fascinated 22-year-old college girl when she arrived at the Philadelphia Cricket Club in 1909 for the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]]. She never before played on grass, but she used her attacking style and rock-ribbed volleying\u2014she was the first woman to rely so heavily on the volley\u2014to win the all-comers final over [[Louise Hammond Raymond|Louise Hammond]] 6\u20138, 6\u20131, 6\u20134 and then the title over 39-year-old [[Maud Barger-Wallach]] 6\u20130, 6\u20131. Wightman also won the women's doubles and mixed doubles titles that year.\n\nIn the 1910 Washington State Championships, Wightman won one of the few recorded \"Golden Matches\" in which the winner did not lose a point. She defeated a Miss Huiskamp (first name unknown).<ref>''All-Time Records'', [[Tennis (magazine)|Tennis Magazine]], February 1981, page 72</ref>\n\nWightman successfully defended all three titles at the U.S. Championships in 1910 and 1911. Wightman easily defeated Hammond in the 1910 singles final. [[May Sutton]], an old West Coast rival and singles titlist at the U.S. Championships in 1904, pushed Wightman hard in the 1911 singles final before Wightman prevailed 8\u201310, 6\u20134, 9\u20137.\n\nThe most remarkable comeback in Wightman's career came at the singles final of the 1911 [[Niagara International Tennis Tournament]] against Sutton. After losing the first set 0\u20136 and going down 1\u20135 in the second, she won 12 straight games and the title 0\u20136, 7\u20135, 6\u20130.<ref name=ohnsorg/>\n\nIn 1912, Wightman married Bostonian George Wightman and did not defend her U.S. titles. However, responding to a challenge from her father to win after becoming a mother, which would be a U.S. first, she played again in 1915, losing the singles final to [[Molla Bjurstedt Mallory]] but winning the women's doubles and mixed doubles titles. At age 32, she won her fourth singles title with the loss of only one set, beating [[Marion Zinderstein]] 6\u20131, 6\u20132 in the final. She also reached the women's doubles final. Thereafter, her success (U.S. adult titles between 1909 and 1943) was limited to doubles.<ref name=ohnsorg/>\n\nWightman envisioned a team tournament for women similar to the [[Davis Cup]] and offered a silver vase as prize. In 1923, the British and Americans had the strongest women players. So, [[Julian Myrick]] of the [[United States Tennis Association|United States Lawn Tennis Association]] decided that a U.S.-Britain competition would be in order for the [[Wightman Cup]]. The event, with Wightman captaining and playing for a winning U.S. side, opened the newly constructed stadium at Forest Hills, New York. A treasured series, it lasted through 1989, disbanding when the event was no longer competitive.\n\nWightman, devoted to the game in all aspects, generously instructed innumerable players at no charge throughout her life. She also teamed with two of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9es who later joined her in the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] to win important titles: [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], U.S., and Olympic doubles titles with [[Helen Wills Moody]] in 1924 and U.S. Indoor women's doubles titles with [[Sarah Palfrey Cooke]] from 1928 through 1931. Her second Olympic gold medal in 1924 came in mixed doubles with [[R. Norris Williams|Dick Williams]].\n\nThe last of Wightman's record 34 U.S. adult titles was recorded in 1943 as she, 56, and [[Pauline Betz Addie]] won the women's doubles title at the [[US Indoors|U.S. Indoor Championships]] over [[Lillian Lopaus]] and [[Judy Atterbury]], 7\u20135, 6\u20131.\n\nWightman was included in the year-end top 10 rankings issued by the [[United States Tennis Association|United States Lawn Tennis Association]] in 1915, 1918, and 1919 and was the top ranked U.S. player in 1919 (rankings began in 1913).<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Tennis Association |title=1988 Official USTA Tennis Yearbook |publisher=H.O.

Empire|CBE]] (n\u00e9e Hotchkiss; December 20, 1886 \u2013 December 5, 1974) was an American [[tennis]] player and founder of the [[Wightman Cup]], an annual team competition for British and American women. She dominated American women's tennis before World War I, and won 45 U.S. titles during her life.\n\n==Personal life==\nWightman was born Hazel Virginia Hotchkiss in Healdsburg, California to William Joseph and Emma Lucretia (Grove) Hotchkiss. In February 1912, at the age of 25, she married George William Wightman of Boston. Her father-in-law, George Henry Wightman, was a leader in the steel industry, as an associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]], and one of the country's foremost pioneers of amateur tennis.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1937/04/21/94357643.html?pageNumber=23 |newspaper=New York Times |title=Geo.

She died at her home in the village of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts on December 5, 1974.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/12/06/87613210.html?pageNumber=42|newspaper=New York Times |date=March 6, 1974 |author=Alfred E. Clark |title=Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman Dies; Holder of Tennis Titles was 86}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Queen Elizabeth II made her an honorary [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].\n\n==Career highlights==\nWightman dominated American women's tennis before World War I and had an unparalleled reputation for sportsmanship. Wightman won a lifetime total of 45 U.S. titles, the last at age 68. She won 16 titles overall at the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]], four of them in singles (1909\u201311, 1919). Nine of her titles at the U.S. Championships came from 1909 to 1911, when she swept the singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles competitions three consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Bud|title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis|year=2010|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=[New York]|isbn=978-0942257700|edition=2nd|pages=467, 468, 479, 481}}</ref>\n\nWightman is known as the \"Queen Mother of American Tennis\" or \"Lady Tennis\" for her lifelong participation in and promotion of women's tennis and because she was instrumental in organizing the Ladies International Tennis Challenge between British and American women's teams, better known as the [[Wightman Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hall of Famers \u2013 Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman|url=http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/hazel-hotchkiss-wightman|publisher=International Tennis Hall of Fame|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> The cup first was held in 1923 and continued through 1989. She played five years on the American team and was the captain of the American team from inception of the competition through 1948. The cup was composed of five singles and two doubles matches. The cup itself was donated in 1923 by Wightman in honor of her husband. The first contest at Forest Hills, New York on August 11 and 13, 1923 was won by the United States.\n\nBorn during the early days of American tennis, Wightman was a frail and awkward child. Her doctor recommended that she take up a sport to strengthen herself. Her brother suggested tennis as it was considered a \"genteel\" sport. Wightman learned to play at the nearby courts of the University of California, Berkeley where she graduated in 1911.

She perfected her volleying style early, hitting the ball against the family home in Berkeley, California, where she grew up and graduated from the University of California. She refused to let the ball bounce because the yard was so uneven. She used to play against her four brothers and then the proud and spiky Sutton sisters.\n\nWightman was a shy, somewhat awed, and fascinated 22-year-old college girl when she arrived at the Philadelphia Cricket Club in 1909 for the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]]. She never before played on grass, but she used her attacking style and rock-ribbed volleying\u2014she was the first woman to rely so heavily on the volley\u2014to win the all-comers final over [[Louise Hammond Raymond|Louise Hammond]] 6\u20138, 6\u20131, 6\u20134 and then the title over 39-year-old [[Maud Barger-Wallach]] 6\u20130, 6\u20131. Wightman also won the women's doubles and mixed doubles titles that year.\n\nIn the 1910 Washington State Championships, Wightman won one of the few recorded \"Golden Matches\" in which the winner did not lose a point. She defeated a Miss Huiskamp (first name unknown).<ref>''All-Time Records'', [[Tennis (magazine)|Tennis Magazine]], February 1981, page 72</ref>\n\nWightman successfully defended all three titles at the U.S. Championships in 1910 and 1911. Wightman easily defeated Hammond in the 1910 singles final. [[May Sutton]], an old West Coast rival and singles titlist at the U.S. Championships in 1904, pushed Wightman hard in the 1911 singles final before Wightman prevailed 8\u201310, 6\u20134, 9\u20137.\n\nThe most remarkable comeback in Wightman's career came at the singles final of the 1911 [[Niagara International Tennis Tournament]] against Sutton. After losing the first set 0\u20136 and going down 1\u20135 in the second, she won 12 straight games and the title 0\u20136, 7\u20135, 6\u20130.<ref name=ohnsorg/>\n\nIn 1912, Wightman married Bostonian George Wightman and did not defend her U.S. titles. However, responding to a challenge from her father to win after becoming a mother, which would be a U.S. first, she played again in 1915, losing the singles final to [[Molla Bjurstedt Mallory]] but winning the women's doubles and mixed doubles titles. At age 32, she won her fourth singles title with the loss of only one set, beating [[Marion Zinderstein]] 6\u20131, 6\u20132 in the final. She also reached the women's doubles final. Thereafter, her success (U.S. adult titles between 1909 and 1943) was limited to doubles.<ref name=ohnsorg/>\n\nWightman envisioned a team tournament for women similar to the [[Davis Cup]] and offered a silver vase as prize. In 1923, the British and Americans had the strongest women players. So, [[Julian Myrick]] of the [[United States Tennis Association|United States Lawn Tennis Association]] decided that a U.S.-Britain competition would be in order for the [[Wightman Cup]]. The event, with Wightman captaining and playing for a winning U.S. side, opened the newly constructed stadium at Forest Hills, New York. A treasured series, it lasted through 1989, disbanding when the event was no longer competitive.\n\nWightman, devoted to the game in all aspects, generously instructed innumerable players at no charge throughout her life. She also teamed with two of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9es who later joined her in the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] to win important titles: [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], U.S., and Olympic doubles titles with [[Helen Wills Moody]] in 1924 and U.S. Indoor women's doubles titles with [[Sarah Palfrey Cooke]] from 1928 through 1931. Her second Olympic gold medal in 1924 came in mixed doubles with [[R. Norris Williams|Dick Williams]].\n\nThe last of Wightman's record 34 U.S. adult titles was recorded in 1943 as she, 56, and [[Pauline Betz Addie]] won the women's doubles title at the [[US Indoors|U.S. Indoor Championships]] over [[Lillian Lopaus]] and [[Judy Atterbury]], 7\u20135, 6\u20131.\n\nWightman was included in the year-end top 10 rankings issued by the [[United States Tennis Association|United States Lawn Tennis Association]] in 1915, 1918, and 1919 and was the top ranked U.S. player in 1919 (rankings began in 1913).<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Tennis Association |title=1988 Official USTA Tennis Yearbook |publisher=H.O.

Beginning in 1925, the French Championships were open to all nationalities, with the results shown here beginning with that year.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Tom Carter and Jim Hotchkiss, ''First Lady of Tennis: Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman'' (June, 2001), Creative Arts Book Company, {{ISBN|978-0887393341}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Tennis Hall of Fame}}\n* {{ITF}}\n* [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1085969/2/index.htm 1972 Sports Illustrated Article \u2013 ''The Original Little Old Lady In Tennis Shoes'']\n\n{{navboxes|title=Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman in the [[grand slam (tennis)|Grand Slam Tournaments]]\n| list1=\n{{U.S. National Championships women's singles champions}}\n{{Wimbledon women's doubles champions}}\n{{U.S. National Championships women's doubles champions}}\n{{U.S. National Championships mixed doubles champions}}\n}}\n{{Footer Olympic Champions Tennis Women's Doubles}}\n{{Footer Olympic Champions Tennis Mixed Doubles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wightman, Hazel}}\n[[Category:1886 births]]\n[[Category:1974 deaths]]\n[[Category:American female tennis players]]\n[[Category:Olympic tennis players of the United States]]\n[[Category:Tennis players at the 1924 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States in tennis]]\n[[Category:United States National champions (tennis)]]\n[[Category:People from the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:International Tennis Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Healdsburg, California]]\n[[Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in women's singles]]\n[[Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in women's doubles]]\n[[Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in mixed doubles]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 1924 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Tennis people from California]]\n", "name_user": "Naraht", "label": "safe", "comment": "linkKappa Kappa GammausingFind link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazel_Hotchkiss_Wightman"}

Arkham Asylum first appeared in ''Batman'' #258 (Oct. 1974), written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] with art by [[Irv Novick]].\n\nArkham Asylum serves as a psychiatric hospital for the [[Gotham City]] area, housing patients who are criminally insane. Arkham's high-profile patients are often from Batman's [[List of Batman Family enemies#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]], such as [[Joker (character)|the Joker]], [[Two-Face]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], [[Riddler|the Riddler]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Clayface]], [[Bane (character)|Bane]], [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|the Mad Hatter]], [[Killer Croc]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Deadshot]], and [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|the Scarecrow]].\n\n==History==\nLocated in [[Gotham City]], Arkham Asylum is where Batman's foes who are considered to be mentally ill are brought as patients (other foes are incarcerated at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]). Although it has had numerous administrators, some comic books have featured [[Jeremiah Arkham]]. Inspired by the works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and in particular his fictional city of [[Arkham|Arkham, Massachusetts]],<ref name=\"Unauthorised\">{{cite book |title=Batman Unauthorized: Vigilantes, Jokers, and Heroes in Gotham City |first=Dennis |last=O'Neil |publisher=BenBella Books |year=2008 |page=[https://archive.org/details/batmanunauthoriz0000unse/page/111 111] |isbn=1-933771-30-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/batmanunauthoriz0000unse/page/111 }}</ref><ref name=\"Dark Age\">{{cite book |title=The Dark Age: Grim, Great & Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics |first1=Mark |last1=Voger |first2=Kathy |last2=Voglesong |page=5 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=1-893905-53-5}}</ref> the asylum was introduced by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Irv Novick]] and first appeared in ''Batman'' #258 (October 1974); much of its [[back-story]] was created by [[Len Wein]] during the 1980s.\n\nArkham Asylum has a poor security record and high recidivism rate, at least with regard to the high-profile cases\u2014patients, such as the Joker, are frequently shown escaping at will\u2014and those who are considered to no longer be mentally unwell and discharged tend to re-offend. Furthermore, several staff members, including its founder, Dr. [[Amadeus Arkham]], and his nephew, director Dr. [[Jeremiah Arkham]], as well as staff members [[Harley Quinn|Dr. Harleen Quinzel]], [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lyle Bolton]] and, in some incarnations, Dr. [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]] and Professor [[Hugo Strange]], have become mentally unwell.\n\nIn addition, prisoners with unusual medical conditions that prevent them from staying in a regular prison are housed in Arkham. For example, [[Mr. Freeze]] is not always depicted as mentally ill, but he requires a strongly refrigerated environment to stay alive; Arkham, with special conditions required for certain patients or inmates being a regularity rather than an exception, is seen by authorities to be an ideal location under certain circumstances.\n\nGotham criminals deemed \"criminally insane\" or \"mentally unfit\" by the court of law generally are treated at Williams Medical Center before being deemed dangerous enough to be sent to Arkham Asylum.<ref name=Laugh>{{Cite comic | writer= [[Ed Brubaker|Brubaker, Ed]] |artist=[[Doug Mahnke|Mahnke, Doug]] |colorist=[[David Baron (comics)|Baron, David]] | letterer=Leigh, Rob |title=[[Batman: The Man Who Laughs]]| date=February 2005 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Arkham-Asylum.jpg|thumb|Arkham Asylum in ''Detective Comics'' (vol. 2) #14 (January 2013). Art by Jason Fabok.]]\nServing as a [[Gotham City]] psychiatric hospital, Arkham Asylum has a long and brutal history, beginning when its own architect became mentally unwell and hacked his workers to death with an axe. He was convicted and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in the same asylum he had been building.<ref name=Laugh /> The one-shot graphic novel ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]'' establishes that the asylum was named after Elizabeth Arkham, the mother of founder [[Amadeus Arkham]]. The original name of the asylum was \"Arkham Hospital\". Its dark history began in the early 1900s when Arkham's mother, having suffered from [[mental illness]] most of her life, committed [[suicide]]. However, it was later revealed that her son had actually [[euthanasia|euthanized]] her and repressed the memory. Amadeus then decided, as the sole heir to the Arkham estate, to remodel his family home in order to properly treat the mentally ill, so others might not suffer the same fate as his mother.\n\nPrior to the period of the hospital's remodeling, Amadeus Arkham treated patients at the State Psychiatric Hospital in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where he, his wife Constance and his daughter Harriet had been living for quite some time. Upon his telling his family of his plans, they moved back to his family home to oversee the remodeling. While there, Amadeus Arkham received a call from the police notifying him that [[Mad Dog (DC Comics)#Martin .22Mad Dog.22 Hawkins|Martin \"Mad Dog\" Hawkins]], a [[serial killer]], referred to Amadeus Arkham by Metropolis Penitentiary while at State Psychiatric Hospital, had escaped from prison and sought his considered opinion on the murderer's state of mind. Shortly afterward, Amadeus Arkham returned to his home to find his front door wide open. Inside, he discovered the [[raped]] and mutilated corpses of his wife and daughter in an upstairs room, with Mad Dog's alias carved on Harriet's body. Despite this family tragedy, the Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane officially opened that November.\n\nWith his sanity in tatters, Dr. Arkham designed a floor plan that evoked [[occult]] runes, he believed that the pattern would drive away the mysterious bat that haunted his dreams.<ref>''Batman The World of the Dark Knight''</ref> One of its first patients was Mad Dog, whom Amadeus Arkham insisted on treating personally. After treating Mad Dog for six months, Amadeus Arkham strapped him to an [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock]] couch, then deliberately and purposefully [[electric shock|electrocuted]] him. The staff treated the death as an accident, but it contributed to Amadeus Arkham's gradual descent into mental illness, which he began to believe was his birthright. Eventually, Amadeus Arkham was a patient in his own asylum after he tried to kill his stockbroker in [[Great Depression|1929]], where he died scratching the words of a binding spell into the walls and floor of his cell with his fingernails and belting out \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" in a loud voice.<ref name=\"Serious\"/>\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Arkham Asylum (Batman -258 (October 1974)).jpg|thumb|right|Arkham Hospital in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #258 (October [[1974 in comics|1974]]). Art by [[Irv Novick]].]]\nArkham Asylum first appeared in October 1974 in ''Batman'' #258, written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and drawn by [[Irv Novick]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In this story, it is named as \"Arkham Hospital\", although it is not clear what kind of hospital it is. \"Arkham Asylum\" first appeared in another O'Neil story the following year, but it was not until 1979 that \"Arkham Asylum\" completely replaced \"Arkham Hospital\", and the occasional \"Arkham Sanitarium\", as the institution's name. Also in 1979, the move to have the asylum closer to Gotham had begun; that was completed in 1980, when ''Batman'' #326 by [[Len Wein]] described the asylum's location \"deep in the [[suburb]]s of Gotham City\". It is perhaps for this reason that ''Batman'' #326 is listed in some histories as the first appearance of Arkham Asylum. It was also Wein who, in 1985's ''Who's Who: The Definitive Dictionary of the DC Universe'' #1, created its current backstory.\n\nArkham Asylum has been demolished or destroyed several times in its history, notably during the events of ''Batman: The Last Arkham'' (see below). It is also seriously damaged at the beginning of the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' storyline, when [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] uses stolen munitions to blow up the facility and release all the patients. After these events, the asylum is relocated to a large mansion known as \"Mercey Mansion\". At the beginning of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline, the asylum is closed down and all its patients discharged. In this instance, a timer was used to open the doors two minutes before the city is sealed. This is orchestrated by the administrator himself, Dr. [[Jeremiah Arkham]], the nephew of Amadeus Arkham, who had the choice of discharging the patients or watching them all starve or kill each other. In the middle of the story, it is revealed during the ''Prodigal'' storyline that Batman has established a hidden base within the sub-basement of the asylum  known as the \"Northwest [[Batcave]]\"<ref name=\"NMLSFO\">{{Cite comic |writer=Kwitney, Alissa |penciller=Zulli, Michael |inker=Locke, Vince |colorist=Giddings, Noelle |letterer= Schubert, Willie |title=Batman: No Man's Land Secret Files and Origins |story=Batcaves |issue=#1 |date=December 1999 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> but it was blown up by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the ''[[Battle for the Cowl]]'' story arc.<ref name=\"Cowl1\">{{Cite comic |writer=Daniel, Tony S |penciller=Daniel, Tony S |inker=Florea, Sandu |colorist=Hannin, Ian |letterer= Fletcher, Jared K |title=Batman: Battle for the Cowl |story=A Hostile Takeover |issue=#1 |date=May 2009 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Battle for the Cowl'' one-shot, Dr. Jeremiah Arkham wanders among the remains of the asylum as he muses on his life. He reveals that he has discovered blueprints created by his uncle, Dr. Amadeus Arkham, for a new Arkham Asylum. He also contemplates the fates of his own nonviolent \"special\" patients: an artist with almost no facial features who must paint facial expressions onto his almost blank face to express himself; a man obsessed with his own reflection in a series of mirrors in his room; and a woman supposedly so ugly, one glance at her face would cause anyone to become mentally ill. Upon discovering his \"special\" patients (unharmed from the destruction thanks to their secluded cells), Arkham resolves to rebuild the facility according to his ancestor's vision, but to serve as a literal asylum for mentally ill patients in order to shelter them from the outside world. However, when told to be happy with the new development, the artist secretly paints his face white with a hideous grin, reminiscent of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]; it is implied that the \"special\" patients, as well as Arkham himself, have given in to mental illness.\n\nIn the ''Arkham Reborn'' miniseries, Arkham Asylum is rebuilt and financed by Dr. Arkham.<ref name=\"Reborn\">{{Cite comic |writer=Hine, David |artist=Haun, Jeremy |colorist=Kalisz, John |letterer=Cipriano, Sal |title=Arkham Reborn |issue=#1\u20133 |date=October\u2013December 2009 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> But in ''Batman'' #697, Dr. Arkham is revealed to be the new Black Mask and is a patient in his own asylum. It was also revealed during ''Arkham Reborn,'' that as both Dr. Arkham and Black Mask, he had begun to manipulate patients, a plotline that culminated in ''Detective Comics'' with Alyce Sinner becoming the new head of the facility, but secretly working with Arkham/Black Mask. It was also revealed that the \"special\" patients were figments of Arkham's imagination.\n\nDuring ''[[Batman Eternal]]'', Arkham Asylum is destroyed as part of the villains' assault on Batman, with Bruce Wayne also being declared bankrupt after Wayne Enterprises loses most of its assets following Hush detonating some of Batman's hidden weapons caches around the city. As a result, Wayne Manor is repossessed by the city and turned into the new Arkham Asylum,<ref>''Arkham Manor'' #1</ref> but Bruce decides to accept the situation on the grounds that he can now keep a closer eye on his foes in the asylum due to his intimate knowledge of the manor's entrances and exits (after sealing off the entrance to the Batcave from the manor).<ref>''Arkham Manor'' #6</ref>\n\n==Staff==\n===[[Prison warden|Wardens]]===\n{{expand section|date=October 2015}}\n* [[Amadeus Arkham|Dr. Amadeus Arkham]]{{spaced ndash}}The founder of the asylum, Amadeus named the institution after his deceased mother Elizabeth.<ref name=\"Serious\"/>\n* [[Jeremiah Arkham|Dr. Jeremiah Arkham]]{{spaced ndash}}The nephew of [[Amadeus Arkham]].

In [[Alan Moore]]'s run in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' the [[Floronic Man]] is detained there and in ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics/Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Doctor Destiny]] escapes the asylum to wreak havoc on both the real and dream worlds.

Cover art of ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #81 (September 1998 DC Comics). Art by Glen Orbik.]]\n\n===''Batman: The Last Arkham''===\n{{Main|Batman: The Last Arkham}}\n''Batman: The Last Arkham'' was written by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]; pencils by [[Norm Breyfogle]], originally a four-issue storyline that kicked off the ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' series. In it, the old Arkham Asylum is destroyed, to be replaced by a new and more modern facility. The story introduces Jeremiah Arkham, the asylum's director and nephew of Amadeus Arkham. In an attempt to discover how criminals, specifically Zsasz, keep escaping, Batman has himself committed to the asylum. Jeremiah uses various methods, such as unleashing many patients on Batman at once, in an attempt to gain psychological insight on the vigilante.\n\nThis story makes a few passing references to the events of ''A Serious House on Serious Earth'', such as Amadeus Arkham taping over the mirror, and his journal is shown early in the story. Jeremiah also mentions his relative's descent into mental illness.\n\nAn episode of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' titled \"Dreams in Darkness\", also about Batman in Arkham, portrays a similar theme, with the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] as the chief villain, also replacing Jeremiah Arkham with a more nondescript administrator, Dr. Bartholemew who is portrayed as na\u00efve rather than sinister.\n\n===''Arkham Asylum: Living Hell''===\n''Arkham Asylum: Living Hell'' was written by [[Dan Slott]], penciled by [[Ryan Sook]] with inks by Sook, [[Wade Von Grawbadger]] and Jim Royal. The series was edited by [[Valerie D'Orazio]]. [[Eric Powell (comic writer)|Eric Powell]] created the painted cover art which appeared on both the original series and graphic novel compilation.\n\nThis six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] and the subsequent trade paperback provided an intricate and multi-layered look at Arkham Asylum from several points of view: director [[Jeremiah Arkham|Dr. Jeremiah Arkham]]; psychiatrist Dr. Anne Carver; the guards, chiefly one Aaron Cash; and the patients. There is a particular focus on previously unknown residents: Jane Doe, a [[wikt:cipher#Noun|cypher]] who assumes the identities of those she kills; Junkyard Dog, a man obsessed with trash; Doodlebug, an artist who uses blood in his paintings; the hulking bruiser Lunkhead; Death Rattle, a [[cult]] leader who speaks to the dead; and [[Humpty Dumpty (comics)|Humpty Dumpty]], an [[obese]] [[Savant syndrome|idiot savant]] obsessed with taking apart and repairing various objects. The driving force is the recent admission of a ruthless investor, [[Great White Shark (comics)|Warren \"The Great White Shark\" White]], as well as the [[demon]]ic element suggested by the title. White, facing charges of massive [[fraud]], [[insanity plea|pleads insanity]] to avoid being sent to prison, knowing he can bribe a Gotham jury. The judge sees through White's attempt to avoid prison and has White admitted to Arkham, which White himself had never even heard of up until that point. He soon realizes the horrors of the place and tries to survive. Ultimately, he is locked in Mr. Freeze's cell and loses his nose and his lips to frostbite while trapped in there, coming to resemble his nickname. He was originally referred to as 'Fish' as new inmates commonly are, but is re-dubbed 'The Great White Shark' by himself. The demonic threat is nullified after the sacrifice of several patients, thanks to the joint effort of [[Etrigan the Demon]] and White tricking the demons into sending themselves back to the Underworld.\n\n===''Black Orchid''===\n''[[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]]'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and illustrated by [[Dave McKean]], also featured Arkham Asylum. The award-winning graphic novel introduced an updated version of the crimefighter [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]], who dies, is reborn and starts a quest to find her identity. During this she encounters Batman, who directs her to Arkham Asylum, where she meets the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], Two-Face and the Joker. Arkham is viewed as a desperate place where patients dwell in terror, much in the same fashion as in ''A Serious House on Serious Earth'', which was also illustrated by McKean.\n\n===''Arkham Reborn''===\n''Arkham Reborn'' is a three-part miniseries written by [[David Hine]] and illustrated by Jeremy Haun. It tells the story of the rebuilding of the Asylum after having been destroyed by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the events of \"Battle for the Cowl\".\n\nIn ''Batman'' #697, it is revealed that Dr. Jeremiah Arkham is the new Black Mask. More is revealed about Dr. Jeremiah Arkham in ''Detective Comics'' #864 and #865.\n\n===''Batman: The Man Who Laughs''===\n{{Main|Batman: The Man Who Laughs}}\n''The Man Who Laughs'' is a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[prestige format]] [[comic book]] written by [[Ed Brubaker]] and illustrated by [[Doug Mahnke]] and [[Patrick Zircher]], released in February 2005. The comic reveals some of the asylum's dark history. As a reporter reports on the asylum's renovation, the Joker poisons her and the crew, stealing the news van to broadcast whenever he wants. He later releases criminally insane patients at Williams Medical Center, who, in a short number of weeks, would have been transferred to Arkham Asylum. In the end, Joker is defeated and he himself is locked behind bars, in a [[straitjacket]] at Arkham.\n\n{{anchor|Made of Wood}}\nThe graphic novel was reprinted with ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #784-786\u2013a storyline entitled \"Made of Wood,\" also written by Brubaker with art by Zircher. In the storyline, [[Batman]] and [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]] track the \"Made of Wood\" serial killer, whose killing spree was cut short when he was admitted to Arkham Asylum. Ex-Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] is also pursuing the killer and he narrows the search down to the two men admitted to Arkham in December 1948, the only living one hardly able to walk and ignorant of the killings. Gordon reaches the grandson of the other, who has taken up the \"Made of Wood\" killer's mantle.\n\n==Alternative versions==\n\n===''The Dark Knight Returns''===\n{{Main|The Dark Knight Returns}}\n''The Dark Knight Returns'', written by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], takes place about 10 years after Batman \"retires.\" It depicts an \"Arkham Home for the Emotionally Troubled\", presumably a renaming of the asylum which occurs as a result of changing attitudes towards mental health. The Joker is housed there, [[catatonia|catatonic]] since Batman's disappearance, but awakens when the vigilante resumes action. Under the employ of the home is Bartholemew Wolper, a condescending [[psychology|psychologist]] who treats the Joker humanely, even going so far to arrange for him to appear on a late night talk show, while arguing that Batman himself is responsible for the crimes his enemies commit by encouraging their existence; Wolper is killed when the Joker uses his lethal gas on the talk show audience.\n\nIn the sequel ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', it is revealed that the patients have taken over and have resorted to [[cannibalism]]. [[Plastic Man]] is one of the more notable patients in this version of Arkham Asylum.\n\n===''JLA: The Nail''===\nIn ''[[JLA: The Nail series|JLA: The Nail]]'', the Joker-using Kryptonian gauntlets provided by a genetically augmented [[Jimmy Olsen]]-breaks into the Asylum, erecting a forcefield around it that prevents anyone but Batman, Robin and Batgirl from entering, while forcing the rest of the patients to fight each other for a chance to live as his slave when only one is left standing. Catwoman wins the resulting conflict shortly before Batman breaks into the asylum, but the Joker's gauntlets allow him to capture Batman, forcing him to watch as the Joker brutally tears Robin and Batgirl apart in front of him. Although Catwoman manages to distract the Joker long enough for Batman to escape and damage his gauntlets, the grief-maddened Batman subsequently beats the Joker to death on the asylum roof before the entire building collapses, apparently killing most of the current patients (although he and Catwoman manage to escape, Batman is only tried for the Joker's death once the immediate crisis is resolved, and the sequel confirms that at least Poison Ivy survived the collapse).\n\n===''Batman: Crimson Mist''===\nIn ''Batman: Crimson Mist'', the third part of the trilogy that began with ''[[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain]]'', the now-vampiric Batman, corrupted by his thirst for blood, breaks into the asylum and murders all the homicidal patients-including [[Amygdala (comics)|Amygdala]], [[Victor Zsasz]] and the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]]-drinking their blood and chopping off their heads to prevent them coming back as vampires (it is unclear if he did this while reveling in his new power or to try and provoke his old allies into destroying what he had become).\n\n==In other media==\nAs an integral part of the Batman franchise, Arkham Asylum has been featured in other media besides the print comics, including the following:\n\n===Television===\n\n====Live-action====\n* Arkham Asylum is mentioned by Barry Allen, who is secretly the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], in an episode of the 1990 television series ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]''.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in the 2002 television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/gotham-showrunner-professor-hugo-strange-and-how-arkham-asylum-came-to-be-part-of-season-one|title=GOTHAM SHOWRUNNER: PROFESSOR HUGO STRANGE AND HOW ARKHAM ASYLUM CAME TO BE PART OF SEASON ONE|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|work=IGN|date=July 21, 2014|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref> It is established that Arkham Asylum was closed down for 15 years prior to the events of the series. In \"[[Arkham (Gotham)|Arkham]],\" Arkham Asylum is shown to be in the Arkham District as Mayor Aubrey James plans to improve the district using the plans that Thomas Wayne was going to go with. [[Carmine Falcone]] and [[Sal Maroni]] were also shown to want some involvement in the plan. Maroni's ally Councilman Zeller has been abducted by the same hitman who killed Councilman Ron Jenkins (who was an ally of Falcone) and is burned alive at Arkham Asylum. At the end of the episode, Mayor James holds a press conference that Falcone will handle the small housing developments in the Arkham District, while Maroni will refurbish Arkham Asylum so that it can be operational again. Around the end of \"Harvey Dent,\" Arkham Asylum is officially reopened where insane bomb maker Ian Hargrove is amongst its latest patients after being rescued from the Russian mob by James Gordon and the Gotham City Police Department. In the aftermath of \"LoveCraft,\" James Gordon is reassigned to guard duty at Arkham Asylum by Mayor Aubrey James. In the follow-up episodes, Gordon makes the acquaintance of Dr. [[Leslie Thompkins]] while dealing with an escaped inmate named [[Electrocutioner|Jack Buchinsky]] who is on a quest to get revenge on [[Sal Maroni]] for setting him up. It is this escape that Gordon uses to get back in the GCPD by promising Commissioner Loeb that he can catch Buchinsky and his accomplice Aaron Danzing. In the second season, Theo Galavan has his sister [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tabitha Galavan]] break up several Arkham inmates to serve in his plan, including [[James Gordon (comics)#Barbara Eileen-Gordon|Barbara Kean]], [[Jerome Valeska]], Richard Sionis, [[Amygdala (comics)|Aaron Helzinger]], Robert Greenwood, and Arnold Dobkins. After Galavan's death, his corpse was taken to an laboratory under Arkham Asylum where the bodies of those like Fish Mooney and Jerome are being kept. This area of the asylum is overseen by Hugo Strange, who conducts various inhuman experiments that include reviving the dead. [[Riddler|Edward Nygma]] is sent here after his crimes are discovered by the GCPD. However, he is later released and declared sane by request of [[Oswald Cobblepot (Gotham)|Penguin]]. During the fourth season, Jerome orchestrates a prison break with Scarecrow and Jervis Tetch to begin his search for his brother Jeremiah Valeska. In the series finale \"[[The Beginning...]]\", which takes place in the distant future, it is revealed that the Riddler and Jeremiah Valeska have been in Arkham Asylum for the past decade, latter one seemingly brain dead after the accident at Ace Chemicals.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in the TV series set in the [[Arrowverse]]:\n** Arkham Asylum appears in the second of the three-part Arrowverse crossover ''[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]'' In the crossover, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], and Green Arrow travel to Arkham Asylum to find [[Doctor Destiny|Dr. John Deegan]], an insane doctor who was given the means to alter reality by [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]]. Psycho-Pirate and Nora Fries are shown as the notable inmates when Deegan releases all the inmates on Green Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, and [[Killer Frost]]. By the end of the crossover, Deegan is remanded to Arkham Asylum and has his cell next to Psycho-Pirate's cell.\n** Arkham Asylum is featured in ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]''. In the episode \"The Rabbit Hole,\" Jacob Kane arranges for [[Beth Kane|Alice]] to be sent to Arkham. The transportation was crashed by a bomb made by Catherine Hamilton-Kane's company. In the episode \"Down Down Down,\" Tommy Elliot is remanded to Arkham Asylum after his plot to draw out Batman fails and Kate states that he can't buy his way out of Arkham Asylum. In the episode \"Mine Is a Long and a Sad Tale,\" it was mentioned that Alice's brother figure Mouse had escaped from Arkham Asylum.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in the season one finale of ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'', titled \"Dick Grayson.\" It appears in a dream world created by [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]] where Dick experiences a dark future where Batman started killing his enemies.\n\n====Animation====\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | width     = 200\n | image1    = Batman Arkham Asylum Television Credits.jpg\n | caption1  = Arkham Asylum as it appeared on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.\n | image2    = Image-Arkham 10.PNG\n | caption2  = The alternate Arkham Asylum as it appeared on the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode ''A Better World, Part 2''.\n}}\n* In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', Arkham has appeared frequently in the series. The episode \"The Trial\" explains that all mentally ill criminals apprehended by the Batman are sent to Arkham rather than jail. The villains are all kept in cells with glass doors, allowing them to be seen at all times to prevent escape. In a few inconsistent appearances, the villains were allowed to keep their costumes; other times they are given asylum uniforms. \n* The television show ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' featured Arkham in a brief [[cameo role|cameo]] during ''A Better World, Part 2'' in an alternate dimension where a [[fascist]] version of the League called the [[Justice Lords]] has taken over the world and dispatches villains via execution or [[lobotomy]]. The asylum is run by a lobotomized version of the Joker and staffed by other lobotomized Batman villains, including [[Two-Face]] as the caretaker and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] as the gardener, and is protected by robotic copies of [[Superman]]. The entire patient population is lobotomized by the alternate Superman's heat vision. The Joker, Two-Face and Poison Ivy are used in both ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''Justice League'' as the key patients of the Asylum.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. Like the original Arkham, several major villains end up in this institution, such as the Joker, Harley Quinn, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze, the Ventriloquist, Hugo Strange, Clayface, and Penguin. [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]] goes to a prison, until becoming [[Doctor Phosphorus|Phosphorus]] (who requires special chemical care). The staff is far more heavily armored than in its previous incarnation, wearing heavy trenchcoats and gloves, though patients continue to escape easily. Much like in the ''Batman Forever'' tie-in game and ''Batman Begins'', it is presented as being inside Gotham, though here it is presented as occupying a small island on a river, with a bridge connecting it to the city.\n* Arkham Asylum is seen in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"Mayhem of the Music Meister\".

In \"Secrets\", Tatsu's newspaper has an article titled \"Arkham Asylum Population on the Rise\". In \"Attraction\", Arkham (misspelled as Arkum) is shown in a news ticker, with Harvey Dent wanting to close down the institution after a recent uprising.\n\n===Films===\n\n====Live-action====\n<!-- did not appear in ''Batman'' or ''Batman Returns'' -->\n* In ''[[Batman Forever]]'', Arkham Asylum was seen at the end of the film. It is designed as a tall, spiraling castle-like structure with narrow hallways lined with brightly lit glass bricks. The Riddler is incarcerated in a large padded cell. The chief psychiatrist is named Doctor Burton, a reference to [[Tim Burton]], who directed 1989's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and 1992's ''[[Batman Returns]]''. There was originally a more in-depth sequence involving Two-Face escaping from Arkham at the beginning of the film, but it was cut.\n* In ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/batman-and-robin.html |title=Review of '&#39;Batman & Robin'&#39; |publisher=DVD Active.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> Arkham Asylum is shown a number of times. It first appears when Mr. Freeze is taken there midway through the film and later at the end when he and Poison Ivy are shown sharing a room. This version is several dozen stories tall on an island several hundred feet above water, into which the patients jump to escape. Lightning also emits a bright green flash through the structure's windows. In addition, the Riddler and Two-Face's costumes from ''[[Batman Forever]]'' can be seen in an evidence room before Bane breaks out to collect Mr. Freeze's armor.\n* In ''[[Batman Begins]]'', Arkham plays a much larger role than the previous films, with [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]] (also known as the Scarecrow) being either the administrator or a high-ranking doctor at the asylum and using it to conduct sadistic experiments with his fear gas, with his own patients as [[guinea pig]]s. He also uses the pipes under the asylum to empty his toxin into the Gotham water supply. Though still on an island separate from Gotham City's mainland, it is surrounded by a [[slum]] region known as the Narrows, instead of the dense forestry of the comics. When it came to a diversion for the fear gas to infect Gotham's water supply, Ra's al Ghul had his men discharge all the patients at Arkham Asylum to keep the police busy. By the end of the film, it is implied that the Narrows has been rendered uninhabitable. Notably, [[Victor Zsasz]] is shown as a high-profile criminal being held in the asylum. The [[National Institute for Medical Research]], Mill Hill, London was used as Arkham in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/606532.0/?utag=8269|title=From leafy suburbs to silver screen|website=Times Series}}</ref>\n* Arkham is mentioned briefly by Harvey Dent, Batman, and [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] in the ''Batman Begins'' sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' when they reference Arkham patients Carmine Falcone and Thomas Schiff, but beyond this instance the asylum is never seen or explored in the story.\n* In ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', it is mentioned that all the patients of Arkham Asylum ([[Joker (The Dark Knight)|except for one]] according to the film's novelization) were moved to the [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] as the result of the effect of [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]]'s death had upon [[Gotham City]] and its administration.\n* At the end of ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]: Ultimate Edition'', Batman reveals to [[Lex Luthor]] that he has made arrangements for Luthor to be transferred to Arkham Asylum.\n* Arkham appears in a flashback for ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DavidAyerMovies/status/581602129615405056|title=David Ayer on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Arkham appears in ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' in a post-credits scene where [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson / Deathstroke]] meets [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://batman-news.com/2017/01/04/lex-luthor-justice-league-arkham-asylum/|title=Lex Luthor in \u2018Justice League\u2019 means we\u2019re taking a trip to Arkham Asylum|publisher=Batman on Film|last=Begley|first=Chris|date=January 4, 2017}}</ref>\n* Arkham Asylum, renamed '''Arkham State Hospital''', appears in ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'' where Arthur Fleck steals a document about his mother, revealing a history of mental instabilities.\n\n====Animation====\n* In ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', the final battle between the original Batman and the Joker is seen taking place at an abandoned Arkham. It is also the same spot where [[Tim Drake|Robin]], [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] and disfigured into resembling a younger version of the Joker, kills the real Joker (either by shooting him with the bang-flag speargun or by pushing him into a tank of water and a mass of wires, causing him to electrocute himself, depending on which version is being seen). A deleted scene, featured on both versions of the DVD as a special feature, has Bruce Wayne touring the abandoned Arkham, where Bruce Wayne's successor as Batman, [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]], follows and sees the Joker's corpse hanging with a sign on it saying \"I Know\". Both the film and the ''Batman Beyond'' episode \"Splicer\" suggest that the facility has moved to a different location.\n* Arkham makes an appearance in the animated anthology film ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'' (set between ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'') within the segment \"Crossfire\". Expanding on Lt. James Gordon's line that \"the Narrows is lost\" at the end of ''Batman Begins'', the film shows that the entire island has become Arkham Asylum's ground, with Narrows residents evacuated from the island after the patients escaped from the facility. After the riot at the end of ''Batman Begins'', the city apparently turned the entire island into a high-tech prison facility in a few months after the incident, enclosed by guard towers, high fences, and the island's natural barrier to keep the inmates from escaping. The [[Gotham City Police Department]] also sends officers to its drawbridges to make sure no one would cross, in or out, without permission.\n* Arkham is featured in the animated film ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]''. The [[Suicide Squad]] infiltrate Arkham Asylum in order to attempt to assassinate the [[Riddler]].\n* Arkham Asylum appears in the ''[[Batman Unlimited#Films|Batman: Unlimited]]'' series of animated films, with its inmates regarding Joker, Penguin, Mister Freeze, Scarecrow, Killer Croc, Bane, Cheetah, Silver Banshee, Clayface, Chemo, Two-Face, Mad Hatter, Riddler and others.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.

In the film, [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] and Ra's al Ghul break into Arkham, where they kill most of the guards, but captured the surviving and held them hostage. They released Joker, Harely Quinn, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, Two-Face, Scarecrow, and Bane and used the Mutagen on them and turn them into Mutants. Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and the Turtles arrived to the handle the situation, though they defeated and subdue and rescue the surviving staff, Joker bit Batman and turn him into a Mutant Bat. They managed to subdue Batman and turn him back to normal, it was later reveal that Shredder and Ra's al Ghul's real plan was to turn everyone in Gotham into mutants from Ace's Chemicals.\n\n===Video games===\n* In ''[[Batman Forever (video game)|Batman Forever]]'' ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game), Arkham Asylum is the first stage.\n* In the game ''[[Batman: Toxic Chill]]'', [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] are taken to \"Arkham\" by [[Riddler]] and his companion [[Mr. Freeze]] and define them in the same room.\n* A crucial showdown takes place in Arkham in ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]''.\n* Arkham is featured prominently in ''[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]''. Three quarters of the way through the game, Batman must infiltrate Arkham Asylum through a secret sewer entrance.\n* Arkham Asylum is one of the levels of the video game counterpart to ''[[Batman Begins]]''.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''. In the game, the chaos of Brainiac's invasions ends up enabling Arkham Asylum's patients to escape from Arkham Asylum. In the \"Arkham Asylum Alert\" mission, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Scarecrow take over Arkham Asylum. In the hero campaign, Batman sends the players to investigate and bring the situation under control. In the villain campaign, Joker sends the players to find out what is going on at his \"house\" and find out why he was not invited.\n* Arkham Asylum is featured in ''[[Batman: The Telltale Series]]''. In Episode 2, it is revealed that Thomas Wayne forcibly committed several patients to Arkham Asylum (including Penguin's mother), which tarnishes the Wayne reputation. In Episode 4, Bruce is placed in Arkham Asylum by Mayor Harvey Dent after he was drugged into nearly killing the Penguin. In Episode 5, [[Vicki Vale|Lady Arkham]] stages a prison breakout that is stopped by Batman, the staff (including Dr. Joan Leland) and the GCPD. Noticeable patients in this version are \"[[Joker (character)|John Doe]]\", [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Arnold Wesker]], [[Victor Zsasz]], [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], and Harvey Dent (only if Batman chose to stop him and send him here in Episode 4).\n\n====''Lego'' series====\n* Arkham Asylum works as the main hub for the villains in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'', whereas the [[Batcave]] works as the main hub for the heroes of the game.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]''. Lex Luthor springs Joker from prison in order to make synthetic [[kryptonite]] to help in his presidential election campaign. As a result of Lex Luthor and Joker using a ray that removes black bricks from Arkham Asylum, it caused a breakout where all of its inmates are freed. The generic Arkham inmates and the generic Arkham patients appear as playable characters.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''. The Joker, along with [[Captain Cold]], [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse-Flash]], [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], and [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Malcolm Merlyn]] are arrested by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Justice Syndicate]] and thrown in Arkham. They are able to break out with the assistance of [[Livewire (comics)|Livewire]], but she and Joker are recaptured by Professor Hugo Strange and used to test his monster-men (inmates he's experimented on), but they escape.\n\n====Batman: Arkham series====\n* ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' is a video game for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was developed by [[Rocksteady Studios]] and published by [[Eidos Interactive]] in conjunction with [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] and DC Comics. The game takes place entirely on Arkham Island, a large island on the middle of the Gotham bay. The game's version of Arkham is similar to its description in ''Gotham Knight'', consisting of individual large buildings in a spacious open air island, rather than a single compound. Its locations include Arkham East, Arkham West, Arkham North, Arkham Mansion and the Botanical Gardens, Intensive Treatment, Medical Facility and Penitentiary. The island also features a network of catacombs, caverns, sewers, and a satellite [[Batcave]] which Batman had outfitted over the years in preparation for emergencies like the one he faces in the game. In the game, a fire had broke out at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] causing its inmates to be temporarily housed at Arkham. When Joker was apprehended, he was freed by Harley Quinn as Joker begins his plot to take over Arkham Asylum, forcing Batman to fight his way through the Asylum inmates to recapture the Joker. During the struggle, the Asylum is badly damaged by the rampaging inmates and the Joker's release of Titan into the water supply enhancing and mutating Poison Ivy's plants, as well as faith in the asylum being compromised with the discovery that key guards and staff were working with the Joker to organize his assault (Although Doctor Penelope Young was merely manipulated by the Joker rather than acting as a willing accomplice).\n* In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', the sequel to ''Batman: Arkham Asylum'', Arkham and Blackgate inmates have been relocated to the Gotham mainland as part of Quincy Sharp's Arkham City project with neither Blackgate Penitentiary or Arkham Asylum in any condition to hold inmates or patients after it was ravaged by Poison Ivy in the first game. Arkham City is a walled off section of Gotham North where its inmates can run free in exchange that they do not escape; this territory includes the old GCPD building and the Monarch Theatre where Thomas and Martha Wayne were killed. The security of Arkham City is enforced by the private military security group TYGER, with territory controlled by the Joker, Penguin, and Two-Face as the City's primary ganglords (although Two-Face has been losing authority prior to the start of the game), with Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy satisfied with control of specific buildings. Riddler discreetly controlled members of the others' gangs, and Catwoman, Bane and Zsasz operated independently in secret. Arkham Asylum itself can be seen from the bay of Arkham City, still ravaged and covered in vines from Poison Ivy's attack.\n* Arkham Asylum is mentioned in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' (a prequel to ''Batman: Arkham Asylum''). At the time of the game, the asylum had been closed for years, with Blackgate taking all the city's criminals\u2014mentally ill and otherwise. During the credits, Jack Ryder's interview with Quincy Sharp has mentioned that in wake of the recent events Arkham Asylum has been reopened. Sharp decided the asylum is necessary to house the new wave of Gotham's most mentally ill criminals such as the Joker. However, revealed in Shiva's extortion file she, per the orders of Ra's al Ghul, manipulated Sharp into opening the Asylum as part of a long-term plan that led to Arkham City's creation.\n* The Asylum is referenced again in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', where Jason Todd is revealed to have been held hostage and tortured by Joker over a year in an abandoned wing of the Asylum while Batman believed he was dead. Arkham City was once more reintegrated into Gotham City and is currently under reconstruction, sponsored by Wayne Enterprises. Arkham Island and the Arkham City area can be seen from the top of Wayne Tower looking out over the bay. Prior to the events of the game, Scarecrow, announces a meeting to Gotham's most notorious supervillains, including Two-Face, the Penguin, the Riddler, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy and the Arkham Knight, held in Arkham Asylum, where it is strongly guarded by military soldiers and drones. In one of the Gotham City Stories, Catwoman tried to infiltrate the meeting, but is spotted by one of the drones. The final confrontation between Batman and Scarecrow takes place in the ruined Asylum, with Jason Todd saving Batman from Scarecrow's control.\n\n====Injustice====\n* Arkham Asylum is a playable stage in the fighting game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. It features multiple Batman villains in the background who also damage the characters in stage transitions. An alternate version of the stage is called Joker's Asylum, taking place in the alternate universe seen in the story where the Joker Clan has taken over the establishment.\n* Arkham Asylum returns as a stage in ''[[Injustice 2]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* Belle Reve\n* [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]\n* [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]]\n* [[Stryker's Island]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.arkhamcare.com Arkham Care]\n* [http://www.batman-on-film.com/comics_arkham-asylum_review_jett_2007.html Batman-On-Film.com] BOF's review of Arkham Asylum, A Serious House on a Serious Earth\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090629085913/http://www.batmanarkhamasylum.com/ Official Videogame Website]\n\n{{Batman}}\n\n[[Category:Psychiatric hospitals in fiction]]\n[[Category:1974 in comics]]\n[[Category:DC Comics prisons]]\n[[Category:Arkham Asylum| ]]\n\n[[fr:Gotham City#L'asile d'Arkham]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{Infobox fictional location\n<!-- legacy information from merge with {{infobox comics location}}\n| bodystyle   = {{Comics infobox sec|1}}\n| abovestyle  = {{Comics infobox sec|2}}\n| titlestyle  = {{Comics infobox sec|2}}\n| headerstyle = {{Comics infobox sec|2}}\n| labelstyle  = {{Comics infobox sec|3}}\n| belowstyle  = {{Comics infobox sec|4}}\n-->\n| name          = Arkham Asylum\n| type          = Asylum for the criminally insane\n| official_name = Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane \n| image         = Arkham Asylum Batman Vol 3 9.png\n| image_size    = \n| caption       = Arkham Asylum in ''Batman'' vol. 3, #9<br />(December 2016).

Arkham Asylum first appeared in ''Batman'' #258 (Oct. 1974), written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] with art by [[Irv Novick]].\n\nArkham Asylum serves as a psychiatric hospital for the [[Gotham City]] area, housing patients who are criminally insane. Arkham's high-profile patients are often from Batman's [[List of Batman Family enemies#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]], such as [[Joker (character)|the Joker]], [[Two-Face]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], [[Riddler|the Riddler]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Clayface]], [[Bane (character)|Bane]], [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|the Mad Hatter]], [[Killer Croc]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Deadshot]], and [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|the Scarecrow]].\n\n==History==\nLocated in [[Gotham City]], Arkham Asylum is where Batman's foes who are considered to be mentally ill are brought as patients (other foes are incarcerated at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]). Although it has had numerous administrators, some comic books have featured [[Jeremiah Arkham]]. Inspired by the works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and in particular his fictional city of [[Arkham|Arkham, Massachusetts]],<ref name=\"Unauthorised\">{{cite book |title=Batman Unauthorized: Vigilantes, Jokers, and Heroes in Gotham City |first=Dennis |last=O'Neil |publisher=BenBella Books |year=2008 |page=[https://archive.org/details/batmanunauthoriz0000unse/page/111 111] |isbn=1-933771-30-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/batmanunauthoriz0000unse/page/111 }}</ref><ref name=\"Dark Age\">{{cite book |title=The Dark Age: Grim, Great & Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics |first1=Mark |last1=Voger |first2=Kathy |last2=Voglesong |page=5 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=1-893905-53-5}}</ref> the asylum was introduced by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Irv Novick]] and first appeared in ''Batman'' #258 (October 1974); much of its [[back-story]] was created by [[Len Wein]] during the 1980s.\n\nArkham Asylum has a poor security record and high recidivism rate, at least with regard to the high-profile cases\u2014patients, such as the Joker, are frequently shown escaping at will\u2014and those who are considered to no longer be mentally unwell and discharged tend to re-offend. Furthermore, several staff members, including its founder, Dr. [[Amadeus Arkham]], and his nephew, director Dr. [[Jeremiah Arkham]], as well as staff members [[Harley Quinn|Dr. Harleen Quinzel]], [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lyle Bolton]] and, in some incarnations, Dr. [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]] and Professor [[Hugo Strange]], have become mentally unwell.\n\nIn addition, prisoners with unusual medical conditions that prevent them from staying in a regular prison are housed in Arkham. For example, [[Mr. Freeze]] is not always depicted as mentally ill, but he requires a strongly refrigerated environment to stay alive; Arkham, with special conditions required for certain patients or inmates being a regularity rather than an exception, is seen by authorities to be an ideal location under certain circumstances.\n\nGotham criminals deemed \"criminally insane\" or \"mentally unfit\" by the court of law generally are treated at Williams Medical Center before being deemed dangerous enough to be sent to Arkham Asylum.<ref name=Laugh>{{Cite comic | writer= [[Ed Brubaker|Brubaker, Ed]] |artist=[[Doug Mahnke|Mahnke, Doug]] |colorist=[[David Baron (comics)|Baron, David]] | letterer=Leigh, Rob |title=[[Batman: The Man Who Laughs]]| date=February 2005 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Arkham-Asylum.jpg|thumb|Arkham Asylum in ''Detective Comics'' (vol. 2) #14 (January 2013). Art by Jason Fabok.]]\nServing as a [[Gotham City]] psychiatric hospital, Arkham Asylum has a long and brutal history, beginning when its own architect became mentally unwell and hacked his workers to death with an axe. He was convicted and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in the same asylum he had been building.<ref name=Laugh /> The one-shot graphic novel ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]'' establishes that the asylum was named after Elizabeth Arkham, the mother of founder [[Amadeus Arkham]]. The original name of the asylum was \"Arkham Hospital\". Its dark history began in the early 1900s when Arkham's mother, having suffered from [[mental illness]] most of her life, committed [[suicide]]. However, it was later revealed that her son had actually [[euthanasia|euthanized]] her and repressed the memory. Amadeus then decided, as the sole heir to the Arkham estate, to remodel his family home in order to properly treat the mentally ill, so others might not suffer the same fate as his mother.\n\nPrior to the period of the hospital's remodeling, Amadeus Arkham treated patients at the State Psychiatric Hospital in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where he, his wife Constance and his daughter Harriet had been living for quite some time. Upon his telling his family of his plans, they moved back to his family home to oversee the remodeling. While there, Amadeus Arkham received a call from the police notifying him that [[Mad Dog (DC Comics)#Martin .22Mad Dog.22 Hawkins|Martin \"Mad Dog\" Hawkins]], a [[serial killer]], referred to Amadeus Arkham by Metropolis Penitentiary while at State Psychiatric Hospital, had escaped from prison and sought his considered opinion on the murderer's state of mind. Shortly afterward, Amadeus Arkham returned to his home to find his front door wide open. Inside, he discovered the [[raped]] and mutilated corpses of his wife and daughter in an upstairs room, with Mad Dog's alias carved on Harriet's body. Despite this family tragedy, the Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane officially opened that November.\n\nWith his sanity in tatters, Dr. Arkham designed a floor plan that evoked [[occult]] runes, he believed that the pattern would drive away the mysterious bat that haunted his dreams.<ref>''Batman The World of the Dark Knight''</ref> One of its first patients was Mad Dog, whom Amadeus Arkham insisted on treating personally. After treating Mad Dog for six months, Amadeus Arkham strapped him to an [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock]] couch, then deliberately and purposefully [[electric shock|electrocuted]] him. The staff treated the death as an accident, but it contributed to Amadeus Arkham's gradual descent into mental illness, which he began to believe was his birthright. Eventually, Amadeus Arkham was a patient in his own asylum after he tried to kill his stockbroker in [[Great Depression|1929]], where he died scratching the words of a binding spell into the walls and floor of his cell with his fingernails and belting out \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" in a loud voice.<ref name=\"Serious\"/>\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Arkham Asylum (Batman -258 (October 1974)).jpg|thumb|right|Arkham Hospital in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #258 (October [[1974 in comics|1974]]). Art by [[Irv Novick]].]]\nArkham Asylum first appeared in October 1974 in ''Batman'' #258, written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and drawn by [[Irv Novick]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In this story, it is named as \"Arkham Hospital\", although it is not clear what kind of hospital it is. \"Arkham Asylum\" first appeared in another O'Neil story the following year, but it was not until 1979 that \"Arkham Asylum\" completely replaced \"Arkham Hospital\", and the occasional \"Arkham Sanitarium\", as the institution's name. Also in 1979, the move to have the asylum closer to Gotham had begun; that was completed in 1980, when ''Batman'' #326 by [[Len Wein]] described the asylum's location \"deep in the [[suburb]]s of Gotham City\". It is perhaps for this reason that ''Batman'' #326 is listed in some histories as the first appearance of Arkham Asylum. It was also Wein who, in 1985's ''Who's Who: The Definitive Dictionary of the DC Universe'' #1, created its current backstory.\n\nArkham Asylum has been demolished or destroyed several times in its history, notably during the events of ''Batman: The Last Arkham'' (see below). It is also seriously damaged at the beginning of the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' storyline, when [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] uses stolen munitions to blow up the facility and release all the patients. After these events, the asylum is relocated to a large mansion known as \"Mercey Mansion\". At the beginning of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline, the asylum is closed down and all its patients discharged. In this instance, a timer was used to open the doors two minutes before the city is sealed. This is orchestrated by the administrator himself, Dr. [[Jeremiah Arkham]], the nephew of Amadeus Arkham, who had the choice of discharging the patients or watching them all starve or kill each other. In the middle of the story, it is revealed during the ''Prodigal'' storyline that Batman has established a hidden base within the sub-basement of the asylum  known as the \"Northwest [[Batcave]]\"<ref name=\"NMLSFO\">{{Cite comic |writer=Kwitney, Alissa |penciller=Zulli, Michael |inker=Locke, Vince |colorist=Giddings, Noelle |letterer= Schubert, Willie |title=Batman: No Man's Land Secret Files and Origins |story=Batcaves |issue=#1 |date=December 1999 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> but it was blown up by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the ''[[Battle for the Cowl]]'' story arc.<ref name=\"Cowl1\">{{Cite comic |writer=Daniel, Tony S |penciller=Daniel, Tony S |inker=Florea, Sandu |colorist=Hannin, Ian |letterer= Fletcher, Jared K |title=Batman: Battle for the Cowl |story=A Hostile Takeover |issue=#1 |date=May 2009 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Battle for the Cowl'' one-shot, Dr. Jeremiah Arkham wanders among the remains of the asylum as he muses on his life. He reveals that he has discovered blueprints created by his uncle, Dr. Amadeus Arkham, for a new Arkham Asylum. He also contemplates the fates of his own nonviolent \"special\" patients: an artist with almost no facial features who must paint facial expressions onto his almost blank face to express himself; a man obsessed with his own reflection in a series of mirrors in his room; and a woman supposedly so ugly, one glance at her face would cause anyone to become mentally ill. Upon discovering his \"special\" patients (unharmed from the destruction thanks to their secluded cells), Arkham resolves to rebuild the facility according to his ancestor's vision, but to serve as a literal asylum for mentally ill patients in order to shelter them from the outside world. However, when told to be happy with the new development, the artist secretly paints his face white with a hideous grin, reminiscent of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]; it is implied that the \"special\" patients, as well as Arkham himself, have given in to mental illness.\n\nIn the ''Arkham Reborn'' miniseries, Arkham Asylum is rebuilt and financed by Dr. Arkham.<ref name=\"Reborn\">{{Cite comic |writer=Hine, David |artist=Haun, Jeremy |colorist=Kalisz, John |letterer=Cipriano, Sal |title=Arkham Reborn |issue=#1\u20133 |date=October\u2013December 2009 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> But in ''Batman'' #697, Dr. Arkham is revealed to be the new Black Mask and is a patient in his own asylum. It was also revealed during ''Arkham Reborn,'' that as both Dr. Arkham and Black Mask, he had begun to manipulate patients, a plotline that culminated in ''Detective Comics'' with Alyce Sinner becoming the new head of the facility, but secretly working with Arkham/Black Mask.

Cover art of ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #81 (September 1998 DC Comics). Art by Glen Orbik.]]\n\n===''Batman: The Last Arkham''===\n{{Main|Batman: The Last Arkham}}\n''Batman: The Last Arkham'' was written by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]; pencils by [[Norm Breyfogle]], originally a four-issue storyline that kicked off the ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' series. In it, the old Arkham Asylum is destroyed, to be replaced by a new and more modern facility. The story introduces Jeremiah Arkham, the asylum's director and nephew of Amadeus Arkham. In an attempt to discover how criminals, specifically Zsasz, keep escaping, Batman has himself committed to the asylum. Jeremiah uses various methods, such as unleashing many patients on Batman at once, in an attempt to gain psychological insight on the vigilante.\n\nThis story makes a few passing references to the events of ''A Serious House on Serious Earth'', such as Amadeus Arkham taping over the mirror, and his journal is shown early in the story. Jeremiah also mentions his relative's descent into mental illness.\n\nAn episode of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' titled \"Dreams in Darkness\", also about Batman in Arkham, portrays a similar theme, with the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] as the chief villain, also replacing Jeremiah Arkham with a more nondescript administrator, Dr. Bartholemew who is portrayed as na\u00efve rather than sinister.\n\n===''Arkham Asylum: Living Hell''===\n''Arkham Asylum: Living Hell'' was written by [[Dan Slott]], penciled by [[Ryan Sook]] with inks by Sook, [[Wade Von Grawbadger]] and Jim Royal. The series was edited by [[Valerie D'Orazio]]. [[Eric Powell (comic writer)|Eric Powell]] created the painted cover art which appeared on both the original series and graphic novel compilation.\n\nThis six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] and the subsequent trade paperback provided an intricate and multi-layered look at Arkham Asylum from several points of view: director [[Jeremiah Arkham|Dr. Jeremiah Arkham]]; psychiatrist Dr. Anne Carver; the guards, chiefly one Aaron Cash; and the patients. There is a particular focus on previously unknown residents: Jane Doe, a [[wikt:cipher#Noun|cypher]] who assumes the identities of those she kills; Junkyard Dog, a man obsessed with trash; Doodlebug, an artist who uses blood in his paintings; the hulking bruiser Lunkhead; Death Rattle, a [[cult]] leader who speaks to the dead; and [[Humpty Dumpty (comics)|Humpty Dumpty]], an [[obese]] [[Savant syndrome|idiot savant]] obsessed with taking apart and repairing various objects. The driving force is the recent admission of a ruthless investor, [[Great White Shark (comics)|Warren \"The Great White Shark\" White]], as well as the [[demon]]ic element suggested by the title. White, facing charges of massive [[fraud]], [[insanity plea|pleads insanity]] to avoid being sent to prison, knowing he can bribe a Gotham jury. The judge sees through White's attempt to avoid prison and has White admitted to Arkham, which White himself had never even heard of up until that point. He soon realizes the horrors of the place and tries to survive. Ultimately, he is locked in Mr. Freeze's cell and loses his nose and his lips to frostbite while trapped in there, coming to resemble his nickname. He was originally referred to as 'Fish' as new inmates commonly are, but is re-dubbed 'The Great White Shark' by himself. The demonic threat is nullified after the sacrifice of several patients, thanks to the joint effort of [[Etrigan the Demon]] and White tricking the demons into sending themselves back to the Underworld.\n\n===''Black Orchid''===\n''[[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]]'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and illustrated by [[Dave McKean]], also featured Arkham Asylum. The award-winning graphic novel introduced an updated version of the crimefighter [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]], who dies, is reborn and starts a quest to find her identity. During this she encounters Batman, who directs her to Arkham Asylum, where she meets the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], Two-Face and the Joker. Arkham is viewed as a desperate place where patients dwell in terror, much in the same fashion as in ''A Serious House on Serious Earth'', which was also illustrated by McKean.\n\n===''Arkham Reborn''===\n''Arkham Reborn'' is a three-part miniseries written by [[David Hine]] and illustrated by Jeremy Haun. It tells the story of the rebuilding of the Asylum after having been destroyed by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the events of \"Battle for the Cowl\".\n\nIn ''Batman'' #697, it is revealed that Dr. Jeremiah Arkham is the new Black Mask. More is revealed about Dr. Jeremiah Arkham in ''Detective Comics'' #864 and #865.\n\n===''Batman: The Man Who Laughs''===\n{{Main|Batman: The Man Who Laughs}}\n''The Man Who Laughs'' is a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[prestige format]] [[comic book]] written by [[Ed Brubaker]] and illustrated by [[Doug Mahnke]] and [[Patrick Zircher]], released in February 2005. The comic reveals some of the asylum's dark history. As a reporter reports on the asylum's renovation, the Joker poisons her and the crew, stealing the news van to broadcast whenever he wants. He later releases criminally insane patients at Williams Medical Center, who, in a short number of weeks, would have been transferred to Arkham Asylum. In the end, Joker is defeated and he himself is locked behind bars, in a [[straitjacket]] at Arkham.\n\n{{anchor|Made of Wood}}\nThe graphic novel was reprinted with ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #784-786\u2013a storyline entitled \"Made of Wood,\" also written by Brubaker with art by Zircher. In the storyline, [[Batman]] and [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]] track the \"Made of Wood\" serial killer, whose killing spree was cut short when he was admitted to Arkham Asylum. Ex-Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] is also pursuing the killer and he narrows the search down to the two men admitted to Arkham in December 1948, the only living one hardly able to walk and ignorant of the killings. Gordon reaches the grandson of the other, who has taken up the \"Made of Wood\" killer's mantle.\n\n==Alternative versions==\n\n===''The Dark Knight Returns''===\n{{Main|The Dark Knight Returns}}\n''The Dark Knight Returns'', written by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], takes place about 10 years after Batman \"retires.\" It depicts an \"Arkham Home for the Emotionally Troubled\", presumably a renaming of the asylum which occurs as a result of changing attitudes towards mental health. The Joker is housed there, [[catatonia|catatonic]] since Batman's disappearance, but awakens when the vigilante resumes action. Under the employ of the home is Bartholemew Wolper, a condescending [[psychology|psychologist]] who treats the Joker humanely, even going so far to arrange for him to appear on a late night talk show, while arguing that Batman himself is responsible for the crimes his enemies commit by encouraging their existence; Wolper is killed when the Joker uses his lethal gas on the talk show audience.\n\nIn the sequel ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', it is revealed that the patients have taken over and have resorted to [[cannibalism]]. [[Plastic Man]] is one of the more notable patients in this version of Arkham Asylum.\n\n===''JLA: The Nail''===\nIn ''[[JLA: The Nail series|JLA: The Nail]]'', the Joker-using Kryptonian gauntlets provided by a genetically augmented [[Jimmy Olsen]]-breaks into the Asylum, erecting a forcefield around it that prevents anyone but Batman, Robin and Batgirl from entering, while forcing the rest of the patients to fight each other for a chance to live as his slave when only one is left standing. Catwoman wins the resulting conflict shortly before Batman breaks into the asylum, but the Joker's gauntlets allow him to capture Batman, forcing him to watch as the Joker brutally tears Robin and Batgirl apart in front of him. Although Catwoman manages to distract the Joker long enough for Batman to escape and damage his gauntlets, the grief-maddened Batman subsequently beats the Joker to death on the asylum roof before the entire building collapses, apparently killing most of the current patients (although he and Catwoman manage to escape, Batman is only tried for the Joker's death once the immediate crisis is resolved, and the sequel confirms that at least Poison Ivy survived the collapse).\n\n===''Batman: Crimson Mist''===\nIn ''Batman: Crimson Mist'', the third part of the trilogy that began with ''[[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain]]'', the now-vampiric Batman, corrupted by his thirst for blood, breaks into the asylum and murders all the homicidal patients-including [[Amygdala (comics)|Amygdala]], [[Victor Zsasz]] and the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]]-drinking their blood and chopping off their heads to prevent them coming back as vampires (it is unclear if he did this while reveling in his new power or to try and provoke his old allies into destroying what he had become).\n\n==In other media==\nAs an integral part of the Batman franchise, Arkham Asylum has been featured in other media besides the print comics, including the following:\n\n===Television===\n\n====Live-action====\n* Arkham Asylum is mentioned by Barry Allen, who is secretly the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], in an episode of the 1990 television series ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]''.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in the 2002 television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/gotham-showrunner-professor-hugo-strange-and-how-arkham-asylum-came-to-be-part-of-season-one|title=GOTHAM SHOWRUNNER: PROFESSOR HUGO STRANGE AND HOW ARKHAM ASYLUM CAME TO BE PART OF SEASON ONE|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|work=IGN|date=July 21, 2014|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref> It is established that Arkham Asylum was closed down for 15 years prior to the events of the series. In \"[[Arkham (Gotham)|Arkham]],\" Arkham Asylum is shown to be in the Arkham District as Mayor Aubrey James plans to improve the district using the plans that Thomas Wayne was going to go with. [[Carmine Falcone]] and [[Sal Maroni]] were also shown to want some involvement in the plan. Maroni's ally Councilman Zeller has been abducted by the same hitman who killed Councilman Ron Jenkins (who was an ally of Falcone) and is burned alive at Arkham Asylum. At the end of the episode, Mayor James holds a press conference that Falcone will handle the small housing developments in the Arkham District, while Maroni will refurbish Arkham Asylum so that it can be operational again. Around the end of \"Harvey Dent,\" Arkham Asylum is officially reopened where insane bomb maker Ian Hargrove is amongst its latest patients after being rescued from the Russian mob by James Gordon and the Gotham City Police Department. In the aftermath of \"LoveCraft,\" James Gordon is reassigned to guard duty at Arkham Asylum by Mayor Aubrey James. In the follow-up episodes, Gordon makes the acquaintance of Dr. [[Leslie Thompkins]] while dealing with an escaped inmate named [[Electrocutioner|Jack Buchinsky]] who is on a quest to get revenge on [[Sal Maroni]] for setting him up. It is this escape that Gordon uses to get back in the GCPD by promising Commissioner Loeb that he can catch Buchinsky and his accomplice Aaron Danzing. In the second season, Theo Galavan has his sister [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tabitha Galavan]] break up several Arkham inmates to serve in his plan, including [[James Gordon (comics)#Barbara Eileen-Gordon|Barbara Kean]], [[Jerome Valeska]], Richard Sionis, [[Amygdala (comics)|Aaron Helzinger]], Robert Greenwood, and Arnold Dobkins. After Galavan's death, his corpse was taken to an laboratory under Arkham Asylum where the bodies of those like Fish Mooney and Jerome are being kept. This area of the asylum is overseen by Hugo Strange, who conducts various inhuman experiments that include reviving the dead. [[Riddler|Edward Nygma]] is sent here after his crimes are discovered by the GCPD. However, he is later released and declared sane by request of [[Oswald Cobblepot (Gotham)|Penguin]]. During the fourth season, Jerome orchestrates a prison break with Scarecrow and Jervis Tetch to begin his search for his brother Jeremiah Valeska. In the series finale \"[[The Beginning...]]\", which takes place in the distant future, it is revealed that the Riddler and Jeremiah Valeska have been in Arkham Asylum for the past decade, latter one seemingly brain dead after the accident at Ace Chemicals.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in the TV series set in the [[Arrowverse]]:\n** Arkham Asylum appears in the second of the three-part Arrowverse crossover ''[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]'' In the crossover, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], and Green Arrow travel to Arkham Asylum to find [[Doctor Destiny|Dr. John Deegan]], an insane doctor who was given the means to alter reality by [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]].

The episode \"The Trial\" explains that all mentally ill criminals apprehended by the Batman are sent to Arkham rather than jail. The villains are all kept in cells with glass doors, allowing them to be seen at all times to prevent escape. In a few inconsistent appearances, the villains were allowed to keep their costumes; other times they are given asylum uniforms. \n* The television show ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' featured Arkham in a brief [[cameo role|cameo]] during ''A Better World, Part 2'' in an alternate dimension where a [[fascist]] version of the League called the [[Justice Lords]] has taken over the world and dispatches villains via execution or [[lobotomy]]. The asylum is run by a lobotomized version of the Joker and staffed by other lobotomized Batman villains, including [[Two-Face]] as the caretaker and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] as the gardener, and is protected by robotic copies of [[Superman]]. The entire patient population is lobotomized by the alternate Superman's heat vision. The Joker, Two-Face and Poison Ivy are used in both ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''Justice League'' as the key patients of the Asylum.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. Like the original Arkham, several major villains end up in this institution, such as the Joker, Harley Quinn, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze, the Ventriloquist, Hugo Strange, Clayface, and Penguin. [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]] goes to a prison, until becoming [[Doctor Phosphorus|Phosphorus]] (who requires special chemical care). The staff is far more heavily armored than in its previous incarnation, wearing heavy trenchcoats and gloves, though patients continue to escape easily. Much like in the ''Batman Forever'' tie-in game and ''Batman Begins'', it is presented as being inside Gotham, though here it is presented as occupying a small island on a river, with a bridge connecting it to the city.\n* Arkham Asylum is seen in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"Mayhem of the Music Meister\". Music Meister visits the place, and forces the patients to sing. [[Calendar Man]], [[Joker (character)|Joker]], King Tut, [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Psycho-Pirate]], [[Doctor Polaris]], [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Two-Face]], [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Top (comics)|Top]], [[Crazy Quilt]], and [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee (comics)|Tweedledum and Tweedledee]] are shown as patients of Arkham Asylum.\n* Arkham Asylum is referred to in ''[[Beware the Batman]]''. In \"Secrets\", Tatsu's newspaper has an article titled \"Arkham Asylum Population on the Rise\". In \"Attraction\", Arkham (misspelled as Arkum) is shown in a news ticker, with Harvey Dent wanting to close down the institution after a recent uprising.\n\n===Films===\n\n====Live-action====\n<!-- did not appear in ''Batman'' or ''Batman Returns'' -->\n* In ''[[Batman Forever]]'', Arkham Asylum was seen at the end of the film. It is designed as a tall, spiraling castle-like structure with narrow hallways lined with brightly lit glass bricks. The Riddler is incarcerated in a large padded cell. The chief psychiatrist is named Doctor Burton, a reference to [[Tim Burton]], who directed 1989's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and 1992's ''[[Batman Returns]]''. There was originally a more in-depth sequence involving Two-Face escaping from Arkham at the beginning of the film, but it was cut.\n* In ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/batman-and-robin.html |title=Review of '&#39;Batman & Robin'&#39; |publisher=DVD Active.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> Arkham Asylum is shown a number of times. It first appears when Mr. Freeze is taken there midway through the film and later at the end when he and Poison Ivy are shown sharing a room. This version is several dozen stories tall on an island several hundred feet above water, into which the patients jump to escape. Lightning also emits a bright green flash through the structure's windows. In addition, the Riddler and Two-Face's costumes from ''[[Batman Forever]]'' can be seen in an evidence room before Bane breaks out to collect Mr. Freeze's armor.\n* In ''[[Batman Begins]]'', Arkham plays a much larger role than the previous films, with [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]] (also known as the Scarecrow) being either the administrator or a high-ranking doctor at the asylum and using it to conduct sadistic experiments with his fear gas, with his own patients as [[guinea pig]]s. He also uses the pipes under the asylum to empty his toxin into the Gotham water supply. Though still on an island separate from Gotham City's mainland, it is surrounded by a [[slum]] region known as the Narrows, instead of the dense forestry of the comics. When it came to a diversion for the fear gas to infect Gotham's water supply, Ra's al Ghul had his men discharge all the patients at Arkham Asylum to keep the police busy. By the end of the film, it is implied that the Narrows has been rendered uninhabitable. Notably, [[Victor Zsasz]] is shown as a high-profile criminal being held in the asylum. The [[National Institute for Medical Research]], Mill Hill, London was used as Arkham in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/606532.0/?utag=8269|title=From leafy suburbs to silver screen|website=Times Series}}</ref>\n* Arkham is mentioned briefly by Harvey Dent, Batman, and [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] in the ''Batman Begins'' sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' when they reference Arkham patients Carmine Falcone and Thomas Schiff, but beyond this instance the asylum is never seen or explored in the story.\n* In ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', it is mentioned that all the patients of Arkham Asylum ([[Joker (The Dark Knight)|except for one]] according to the film's novelization) were moved to the [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] as the result of the effect of [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]]'s death had upon [[Gotham City]] and its administration.\n* At the end of ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]: Ultimate Edition'', Batman reveals to [[Lex Luthor]] that he has made arrangements for Luthor to be transferred to Arkham Asylum.\n* Arkham appears in a flashback for ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DavidAyerMovies/status/581602129615405056|title=David Ayer on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Arkham appears in ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' in a post-credits scene where [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson / Deathstroke]] meets [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://batman-news.com/2017/01/04/lex-luthor-justice-league-arkham-asylum/|title=Lex Luthor in \u2018Justice League\u2019 means we\u2019re taking a trip to Arkham Asylum|publisher=Batman on Film|last=Begley|first=Chris|date=January 4, 2017}}</ref>\n* Arkham Asylum, renamed '''Arkham State Hospital''', appears in ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'' where Arthur Fleck steals a document about his mother, revealing a history of mental instabilities.\n\n====Animation====\n* In ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', the final battle between the original Batman and the Joker is seen taking place at an abandoned Arkham. It is also the same spot where [[Tim Drake|Robin]], [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] and disfigured into resembling a younger version of the Joker, kills the real Joker (either by shooting him with the bang-flag speargun or by pushing him into a tank of water and a mass of wires, causing him to electrocute himself, depending on which version is being seen). A deleted scene, featured on both versions of the DVD as a special feature, has Bruce Wayne touring the abandoned Arkham, where Bruce Wayne's successor as Batman, [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]], follows and sees the Joker's corpse hanging with a sign on it saying \"I Know\". Both the film and the ''Batman Beyond'' episode \"Splicer\" suggest that the facility has moved to a different location.\n* Arkham makes an appearance in the animated anthology film ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'' (set between ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'') within the segment \"Crossfire\". Expanding on Lt. James Gordon's line that \"the Narrows is lost\" at the end of ''Batman Begins'', the film shows that the entire island has become Arkham Asylum's ground, with Narrows residents evacuated from the island after the patients escaped from the facility. After the riot at the end of ''Batman Begins'', the city apparently turned the entire island into a high-tech prison facility in a few months after the incident, enclosed by guard towers, high fences, and the island's natural barrier to keep the inmates from escaping. The [[Gotham City Police Department]] also sends officers to its drawbridges to make sure no one would cross, in or out, without permission.\n* Arkham is featured in the animated film ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]''.

In the film, [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] and Ra's al Ghul break into Arkham, where they kill most of the guards, but captured the surviving and held them hostage. They released Joker, Harely Quinn, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, Two-Face, Scarecrow, and Bane and used the Mutagen on them and turn them into Mutants. Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and the Turtles arrived to the handle the situation, though they defeated and subdue and rescue the surviving staff, Joker bit Batman and turn him into a Mutant Bat. They managed to subdue Batman and turn him back to normal, it was later reveal that Shredder and Ra's al Ghul's real plan was to turn everyone in Gotham into mutants from Ace's Chemicals.\n\n===Video games===\n* In ''[[Batman Forever (video game)|Batman Forever]]'' ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game), Arkham Asylum is the first stage.\n* In the game ''[[Batman: Toxic Chill]]'', [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] are taken to \"Arkham\" by [[Riddler]] and his companion [[Mr. Freeze]] and define them in the same room.\n* A crucial showdown takes place in Arkham in ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]''.\n* Arkham is featured prominently in ''[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]''.

In the hero campaign, Batman sends the players to investigate and bring the situation under control. In the villain campaign, Joker sends the players to find out what is going on at his \"house\" and find out why he was not invited.\n* Arkham Asylum is featured in ''[[Batman: The Telltale Series]]''. In Episode 2, it is revealed that Thomas Wayne forcibly committed several patients to Arkham Asylum (including Penguin's mother), which tarnishes the Wayne reputation. In Episode 4, Bruce is placed in Arkham Asylum by Mayor Harvey Dent after he was drugged into nearly killing the Penguin. In Episode 5, [[Vicki Vale|Lady Arkham]] stages a prison breakout that is stopped by Batman, the staff (including Dr. Joan Leland) and the GCPD. Noticeable patients in this version are \"[[Joker (character)|John Doe]]\", [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Arnold Wesker]], [[Victor Zsasz]], [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], and Harvey Dent (only if Batman chose to stop him and send him here in Episode 4).\n\n====''Lego'' series====\n* Arkham Asylum works as the main hub for the villains in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'', whereas the [[Batcave]] works as the main hub for the heroes of the game.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]''.

They are able to break out with the assistance of [[Livewire (comics)|Livewire]], but she and Joker are recaptured by Professor Hugo Strange and used to test his monster-men (inmates he's experimented on), but they escape.\n\n====Batman: Arkham series====\n* ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' is a video game for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was developed by [[Rocksteady Studios]] and published by [[Eidos Interactive]] in conjunction with [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] and DC Comics. The game takes place entirely on Arkham Island, a large island on the middle of the Gotham bay. The game's version of Arkham is similar to its description in ''Gotham Knight'', consisting of individual large buildings in a spacious open air island, rather than a single compound. Its locations include Arkham East, Arkham West, Arkham North, Arkham Mansion and the Botanical Gardens, Intensive Treatment, Medical Facility and Penitentiary. The island also features a network of catacombs, caverns, sewers, and a satellite [[Batcave]] which Batman had outfitted over the years in preparation for emergencies like the one he faces in the game. In the game, a fire had broke out at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] causing its inmates to be temporarily housed at Arkham. When Joker was apprehended, he was freed by Harley Quinn as Joker begins his plot to take over Arkham Asylum, forcing Batman to fight his way through the Asylum inmates to recapture the Joker. During the struggle, the Asylum is badly damaged by the rampaging inmates and the Joker's release of Titan into the water supply enhancing and mutating Poison Ivy's plants, as well as faith in the asylum being compromised with the discovery that key guards and staff were working with the Joker to organize his assault (Although Doctor Penelope Young was merely manipulated by the Joker rather than acting as a willing accomplice).\n* In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', the sequel to ''Batman: Arkham Asylum'', Arkham and Blackgate inmates have been relocated to the Gotham mainland as part of Quincy Sharp's Arkham City project with neither Blackgate Penitentiary or Arkham Asylum in any condition to hold inmates or patients after it was ravaged by Poison Ivy in the first game. Arkham City is a walled off section of Gotham North where its inmates can run free in exchange that they do not escape; this territory includes the old GCPD building and the Monarch Theatre where Thomas and Martha Wayne were killed. The security of Arkham City is enforced by the private military security group TYGER, with territory controlled by the Joker, Penguin, and Two-Face as the City's primary ganglords (although Two-Face has been losing authority prior to the start of the game), with Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy satisfied with control of specific buildings. Riddler discreetly controlled members of the others' gangs, and Catwoman, Bane and Zsasz operated independently in secret. Arkham Asylum itself can be seen from the bay of Arkham City, still ravaged and covered in vines from Poison Ivy's attack.\n* Arkham Asylum is mentioned in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' (a prequel to ''Batman: Arkham Asylum''). At the time of the game, the asylum had been closed for years, with Blackgate taking all the city's criminals\u2014mentally ill and otherwise. During the credits, Jack Ryder's interview with Quincy Sharp has mentioned that in wake of the recent events Arkham Asylum has been reopened. Sharp decided the asylum is necessary to house the new wave of Gotham's most mentally ill criminals such as the Joker. However, revealed in Shiva's extortion file she, per the orders of Ra's al Ghul, manipulated Sharp into opening the Asylum as part of a long-term plan that led to Arkham City's creation.\n* The Asylum is referenced again in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', where Jason Todd is revealed to have been held hostage and tortured by Joker over a year in an abandoned wing of the Asylum while Batman believed he was dead. Arkham City was once more reintegrated into Gotham City and is currently under reconstruction, sponsored by Wayne Enterprises. Arkham Island and the Arkham City area can be seen from the top of Wayne Tower looking out over the bay. Prior to the events of the game, Scarecrow, announces a meeting to Gotham's most notorious supervillains, including Two-Face, the Penguin, the Riddler, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy and the Arkham Knight, held in Arkham Asylum, where it is strongly guarded by military soldiers and drones. In one of the Gotham City Stories, Catwoman tried to infiltrate the meeting, but is spotted by one of the drones. The final confrontation between Batman and Scarecrow takes place in the ruined Asylum, with Jason Todd saving Batman from Scarecrow's control.\n\n====Injustice====\n* Arkham Asylum is a playable stage in the fighting game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. It features multiple Batman villains in the background who also damage the characters in stage transitions. An alternate version of the stage is called Joker's Asylum, taking place in the alternate universe seen in the story where the Joker Clan has taken over the establishment.\n* Arkham Asylum returns as a stage in ''[[Injustice 2]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* Belle Reve\n* [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]\n* [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]]\n* [[Stryker's Island]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.arkhamcare.com Arkham Care]\n* [http://www.batman-on-film.com/comics_arkham-asylum_review_jett_2007.html Batman-On-Film.com] BOF's review of Arkham Asylum, A Serious House on a Serious Earth\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090629085913/http://www.batmanarkhamasylum.com/ Official Videogame Website]\n\n{{Batman}}\n\n[[Category:Psychiatric hospitals in fiction]]\n[[Category:1974 in comics]]\n[[Category:DC Comics prisons]]\n[[Category:Arkham Asylum| ]]\n\n[[fr:Gotham City#L'asile d'Arkham]]\n", "name_user": "RaiBrown1204", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_Asylum"}

Reductions in its extent began in 1750, when its western part became [[Anson County, North Carolina|Anson County]].  In 1752 the northern part of Bladen County was combined with parts of [[Granville County, North Carolina|Granville County]] and [[Johnston County, North Carolina|Johnston County]] to form [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange County]].  In 1754 the northern part of what was left of Bladen County became [[Cumberland County, North Carolina|Cumberland County]].  In 1764 the southern part of what remained of Bladen County was combined with part of [[New Hanover County, North Carolina|New Hanover County]] to form [[Brunswick County, North Carolina|Brunswick County]].

They were among the first and best-known collectors of German and European folk tales, and popularized traditional oral tale types such as \"[[Cinderella]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Aschenputtel}}\"), \"[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Der Froschk\u00f6nig}}\"), \"[[The Goose-Girl]]\" (\"Die G\u00e4nsemagd\"), \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" (\"{{lang|de|H\u00e4nsel und Gretel}}\"), \"[[Rapunzel]]\", \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\", \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", \"[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats]]\", \"[[The Three Little Pigs]]\", \"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Rumpelstilzchen}}\"), \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Dornr\u00f6schen}}\"), and \"[[Snow White]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Schneewittchen}}\"). Their classic collection, ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Children's and Household Tales]]'' (''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}''), was published in two volumes\u2014the first in 1812 and the second in 1815.\n\nThe brothers were born in the town of [[Hanau]] in [[Hesse-Cassel]] (now Germany) and spent most of their childhood in the nearby town of [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]]. Their father's death in 1796 impoverished  the family and affected the brothers for many years after. They attended the [[University of Marburg]] where they began a lifelong dedication to researching the early history of German language and literature, including German [[Oral tradition|folktales]]. The rise of [[Romanticism]] during the 18th century had revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to the Grimms and their colleagues represented a pure form of national literature and culture. The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for [[folkloristics|folklore studies]]. Between the first edition of 1812\u20131815 and the seventh (and final) edition of 1857, they revised their collection many times, so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The original folk & fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm : the complete first edition|others=Grimm, Wilhelm, 1786-1859,, Grimm, Jacob, 1785-1863,, Zipes, Jack, 1937-, Dezs\u00f6, Andrea|isbn=9780691160597|location=Princeton [New Jersey]|oclc=879662315|year = 2014}}</ref> In addition to collecting and editing folk tales, the brothers compiled German legends. Individually, they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship. Together, in 1838, they began work on a massive historical German dictionary (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}}'') which, in their lifetimes, they completed only as far as the word ''Frucht'' ('fruit').\n\nMany of the Grimms' folk tales have enjoyed enduring popularity. The tales are available in more than 100 languages and have been adapted by filmmakers including [[Lotte Reiniger]] and [[Walt Disney]], with films such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. During the 1930s and 40s, the tales were used as propaganda by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]; later in the 20th century, psychologists such as [[Bruno Bettelheim]] reaffirmed the value of the work, in spite of the cruelty and violence in original versions of some of the tales (which the Grimms eventually sanitized).\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:SteinauBGHFrosch retouched.jpg|thumb|left|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm lived in this house in [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]] from 1791 to 1796.]]\n[[Jacob Grimm|Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm]] was born on 4&nbsp;January 1785, and his brother [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm Carl Grimm]] was born on 24&nbsp;February 1786. Both were born in [[Hanau]], in the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (present-day Germany), to [[Philipp Grimm|Philipp Wilhelm Grimm]], a [[jurist]], and Dorothea Grimm n\u00e9e Zimmer, daughter of a [[Kassel]] city councilman.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> They were the second- and third-eldest surviving siblings in a family of nine children, three of whom died in infancy.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /><ref>Frederick Herman George ({{lang|de|Friedrich Hermann Georg}}; 12 December 1783&nbsp;\u2013 16 March 1784), [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]], [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]], Carl Frederick ({{lang|de|Carl Friedrich}}; 24 April 1787&nbsp;\u2013 25 May 1852), Ferdinand Philip ({{lang|de|Ferdinand Philipp}}; 18 December 1788&nbsp;\u2013 6 January 1845), Louis Emil ({{lang|de|Ludwig Emil}}; 14 March 1790&nbsp;\u2013 4 April 1863), Frederick ({{lang|de|Friedrich}}; 15 June 1791&nbsp;\u2013 20 August 1792), Charlotte \"Lotte\" Amalie (10 May 1793&nbsp;\u2013 15 June 1833) and George Edward ({{lang|de|Georg Eduard}}; 26 July 1794&nbsp;\u2013 19 April 1795).</ref><ref name=\"Michaelis-Jena-9\">{{Harvnb|Michaelis-Jena|1970|p=9}}</ref> In 1791, the family moved to the countryside town of [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]], when Philipp was employed there as district [[magistrate]] (''{{lang|de|[[Amtmann]]}}'').  The family became prominent members of the community, residing in a large home surrounded by fields. Biographer [[Jack Zipes]] writes that the brothers were happy in Steinau and \"clearly fond of country life\".<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> The children were educated at home by private tutors, receiving strict instruction as [[Lutherans]] that instilled in both a lifelong religious faith.<ref>Herbert Scurla: Die Br\u00fcder Grimm, Berlin 1985, pp. 14\u201316</ref> Later, they attended local schools.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=2\u20135}}</ref>\n\nIn 1796, Philipp Grimm died of pneumonia, plunging his family into poverty, and they were forced to relinquish their servants and large house. Dorothea depended on financial support from her father and sister, who was the first [[lady-in-waiting]] at the court of [[William I, Elector of Hesse]]. Jacob was the eldest living son, and he was forced at age 11 to assume adult responsibilities (shared with Wilhelm) for the next two years. The two boys adhered to the advice of their grandfather, who continually exhorted them to be industrious.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" />\n\nThe brothers left Steinau and their family in 1798 to attend the ''{{lang|de|[[Friedrichsgymnasium Kassel|Friedrichsgymnasium]]}}'' in [[Kassel]], which had been arranged and paid for by their aunt. By then, they were without a male provider (their grandfather died that year), forcing them to rely entirely on each other, and they became exceptionally close. The two brothers differed in temperament; Jacob was introspective and Wilhelm was outgoing (although he often suffered from ill-health). Sharing a strong work ethic, they excelled in their studies. In Kassel, they became acutely aware of their inferior social status relative to \"high-born\" students who received more attention. Still, each brother graduated at the head of his class: Jacob in 1803 and Wilhelm in 1804.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /><ref name=\"Z(1988)31ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=31}}</ref>\n\n=== Kassel ===\nAfter graduation from the ''{{lang|de|Friedrichsgymnasium}}'', the brothers attended the [[University of Marburg]]. The university was small with about 200 students and there they became painfully aware that students of lower social status were not treated equally. They were disqualified from admission because of their social standing and had to request dispensation to study law. Wealthier students received stipends, but the brothers were excluded even from tuition aid. Their poverty kept them from student activities or university social life; ironically, however, their outsider status worked in their favor, and they pursued their studies with extra vigor.<ref name=\"Z(1988)31ff\" />\n\n[[File:Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm.png|thumb|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in an 1843 drawing by their younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]]]]\n\nThe brothers were inspired by their law professor [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Friedrich von Savigny]], who awakened in them an interest in history and [[philology]], and they turned to studying [[Middle High German literature|medieval German literature]].<ref name=\"Z(1988)35ff\" /> They shared Savigny's desire to see unification of the 200 German [[Principality|principalities]] into a single state. Through Savigny and his circle of friends\u2014[[German Romanticism|German romantics]] such as [[Clemens Brentano]] and [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]]\u2014the Grimms were introduced to the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who thought that German literature should revert to simpler forms, which he defined as ''{{lang|de|Volkspoesie}}'' (natural poetry) as opposed to ''{{lang|de|Kunstpoesie}}'' (artistic poetry).<ref name=\"Z(2002)7ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> The brothers dedicated themselves with great enthusiasm to their studies, about which Wilhelm wrote in his autobiography, \"the ardor with which we studied Old German helped us overcome the spiritual depression of those days.\"<ref name=\"Z(2002)7\">qtd. in {{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|p=7}}</ref>\n\nJacob was still financially responsible for his mother, brother, and younger siblings in 1805, so he accepted a post in Paris as research assistant to von Savigny. On his return to Marburg, he was forced to abandon his studies to support the family, whose poverty was so extreme that food was often scarce. He took a job with the Hessian War Commission. In a letter written to his aunt at this time, Wilhelm wrote of their circumstances, \"We five people eat only three portions and only once a day\".<ref name=\"Z(1988)35ff\">qtd. in {{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=35}}</ref>\n\nJacob found full-time employment in 1808 when he was appointed court librarian to the [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|King of Westphalia]] and went on to become librarian in Kassel.<ref name=\"Pitt\">{{cite web |last=Ashliman |first=D.L |title=Grimm Brothers Home Page |authorlink=D. L. Ashliman|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm.html |publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]] |accessdate=11 March 2012 }}</ref> After their mother's death that year, he became fully responsible for his younger siblings. He arranged and paid for his brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Ludwig]]'s studies at art school and for Wilhelm's extended visit to [[Halle (Westfalen)|Halle]] to seek treatment for heart and respiratory ailments, following which Wilhelm joined Jacob as librarian in Kassel.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> The brothers also began collecting folk tales at about this time, in a cursory manner and on Brentano's request. According to Jack Zipes, at this point \"the Grimms were unable to devote all their energies to their research and did not have a clear idea about the significance of collecting folk tales in this initial phase.\"<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" />\n\nDuring their employment as librarians\u2014which paid little but afforded them ample time for research\u2014the brothers experienced a productive period of scholarship, publishing a number of books between 1812 and 1830.<ref name=\"Z218ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|pp=218\u2013219}}</ref> In 1812, they published their first volume of 86 folk tales, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'', followed quickly by two volumes of German legends and a volume of early literary history.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /> They went on to publish works about [[Danish folklore|Danish]] and [[Irish mythology|Irish]] folk tales and [[Norse mythology]], while continuing to edit the German folk tale collection. These works became so widely recognized that the brothers received honorary doctorates from universities in [[Marburg]], [[Berlin]], and Breslau (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]]).<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\n=== G\u00f6ttingen ===\nIn 1825, Wilhelm married Henriette Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild, a long-time family friend and one of a group who supplied them with stories. Jacob never married but continued to live in the household with Wilhelm and Dortchen.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=7\u20139}}</ref> In 1830, both brothers were overlooked when the post of chief librarian came available, which disappointed them greatly.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" /> They moved the household to [[G\u00f6ttingen]] in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] where they took employment at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], Jacob as a professor and head librarian and Wilhelm as professor.<ref name=\"Pitt\" />\n\n[[File:Im Kolleg bei Jacob Grimm 1830.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jacob Grimm lecturing (illustration by [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]], c. 1830)]]\n\nDuring the next seven years, the brothers continued to research, write, and publish. In 1835, Jacob published the well-regarded ''German Mythology'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mythologie]]}}''); Wilhelm continued to edit and prepare the third edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' for publication. The two brothers taught  [[German studies]] at the university, becoming well-respected in the newly established discipline.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\nIn 1837, they lost their university posts after joining the rest of the [[G\u00f6ttingen Seven]] in protest. The 1830s were a period of political upheaval and peasant revolt in Germany, leading to the movement for democratic reform known as [[Young Germany]].  The Grimm brothers were not directly aligned with the Young Germans, but five of their colleagues reacted against the demands of [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]], who dissolved the parliament of [[Hanover]] in 1837 and demanded oaths of allegiance from civil servants\u2014including professors at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. For refusing to sign the oath, the seven professors were dismissed and three were deported from Hanover, including Jacob who went to Kassel. He was later joined there by Wilhelm, Dortchen, and their four children.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\nThe brothers were without income in 1838 and again in extreme financial difficulty, so they began what became a lifelong project: the writing of a definitive dictionary. The first volume of their ''German Dictionary'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}}'') was not published until 1854. The brothers again depended on friends and supporters for financial assistance and influence in finding employment.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\n=== Berlin and later years ===\n[[File:Graves of the Brothers Grimm at Alter St.-Matth\u00e4us-Kirchhof Berlin 2012.jpg|thumb|The graves of the Brothers Grimm in [[Sch\u00f6neberg]], Berlin (St. Matth\u00e4us Kirchhof Cemetery)]]\n\nIn 1840, von Savigny and Bettina von Arnim appealed successfully to [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] on behalf of the brothers who were offered posts at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. In addition to teaching posts, the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] offered them stipends to continue their research. Once they had established their household in Berlin, they directed their efforts towards the work on the German dictionary and continued to publish their research. Jacob turned his attention to researching German legal traditions and the history of the German language, which was published in the late 1840s and early 1850s; meanwhile, Wilhelm began researching [[medieval literature]] while editing new editions of  ''{{lang|de|Hausm\u00e4rchen}}''.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\nAfter the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], the brothers were elected to the civil parliament. Jacob became a prominent member of the National Assembly at [[Mainz]].<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" /> Their political activities were short-lived, as their hope dwindled for a unified Germany and their disenchantment grew.  In the late 1840s, Jacob resigned his university position and saw the publication of ''The History of the German Language'' (''{{lang|de|Geschichte der deutschen Sprache}}''). Wilhelm continued at his university post until 1852. After retiring from teaching, the brothers devoted themselves to the ''German Dictionary'' for the rest of their lives.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" /> Wilhelm died of an infection in Berlin in 1859,<ref name=\"NG\" /> and Jacob became increasingly reclusive, deeply upset at his brother's death. He continued work on the dictionary until his own death in 1863. Zipes writes of the Grimm brothers' dictionary and of their very large body of work: \"Symbolically the last word was ''{{lang|de|Frucht}}'' (fruit).\"<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\n== Collaborations ==\n\n=== ''Children's and Household Tales'' ===\n{{Main|Grimms' Fairy Tales}}\n\n==== Background ====\nThe rise of [[romanticism]], [[Romantic nationalism]], and trends in valuing popular culture in the early 19th century revived interest in fairy tales, which had declined since their late-17th-century peak.<ref name=\"Jean\" /> [[Johann Karl August Mus\u00e4us]] published a popular collection of tales between 1782 and 1787;<ref name=\"Haase2008\">{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=138}}</ref> the Grimms aided the revival with their folklore collection, built on the conviction that a national identity could be found in popular culture and with the common folk (''{{lang|de|Volk}}''). They collected and published their tales as a reflection of German cultural identity. In the first collection, though, they included [[Charles Perrault]]'s tales, published in Paris in 1697 and written for the [[salon (gathering)|literary salons]] of an aristocratic French audience. Scholar Lydie Jean says that Perrault created a myth that his tales came from the common people and reflected existing folklore to justify including them\u2014even though many of them were original.<ref name=\"Jean\" />\n\n[[File:Arthur Rackham Little Red Riding Hood+.jpg|thumb|left|The Grimms defined \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", shown here in an illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]], as representative of a uniquely German tale although it existed in various versions and regions.<ref name=\"Txxxviff\" />]]\n\nThe brothers were directly influenced by Brentano and von Arnim, who edited and adapted the folk songs of ''{{lang|de|[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]}}'' (''The Boy's Magic Horn'' or [[cornucopia]]).<ref name=\"Haase2008\" /> They began the collection with the purpose of creating a scholarly treatise of traditional stories and of preserving the stories as they had been handed from generation to generation\u2014a practice that was threatened by increased industrialization.<ref name=\"Txxxff\" /> [[Maria Tatar]], professor of German studies at [[Harvard University]], explains that it is precisely the handing from generation to generation and the genesis in the [[oral tradition]] that gives folk tales an important mutability. Versions of tales differ from region to region, \"picking up bits and pieces of local culture and lore, drawing a turn of phrase from a song or another story and fleshing out characters with features taken from the audience witnessing their performance.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxvi}}</ref>\n\nHowever, as Tatar explains, the Grimms appropriated stories as being uniquely German, such as \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", which had existed in many versions and regions throughout Europe, because they believed that such stories were reflections of Germanic culture.<ref name=\"Txxxviff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxviii}}</ref> Furthermore, the brothers saw fragments of old religions and faiths reflected in the stories, which they thought continued to exist and survive through the telling of stories.<ref name=\"Murphy3ff\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2000|pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\n==== Methodology ====\nWhen Jacob returned to Marburg from Paris in 1806, their friend Brentano sought the brothers' help in adding to his collection of folk tales, at which time the brothers began to gather tales in an organized fashion.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> By 1810, they had produced a manuscript collection of several dozen tales, written after inviting storytellers to their home and transcribing what they heard. These tales were heavily modified in transcription, and many had roots in previously written sources.<ref name=\"H579\">{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=579}}</ref> At Brentano's request, they printed and sent him copies of the 53 tales that they collected for inclusion in his third volume of ''{{lang|de|Des Knaben Wunderhorn}}''.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /> Brentano either ignored or forgot about the tales, leaving the copies in a church in [[Alsace]] where they were found in 1920 and became known as the \u00d6lenberg manuscript. It is the earliest extant version of the Grimms' collection and has become a valuable source to scholars studying the development of the Grimms' collection from the time of its inception. The manuscript was published in 1927 and again in 1975.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|p=62}}</ref>\n\nThe brothers gained a reputation for collecting tales from peasants, although many tales came from middle-class or aristocratic acquaintances. Wilhelm's wife Dortchen Wild and her family, with their nursery maid, told the brothers some of the more well-known tales, such as \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" and \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\".<ref name=\"J177ff\" /> Wilhelm collected a number of tales after befriending [[August von Haxthausen]], whom he visited in 1811 in [[Westphalia]] where he heard stories from von Haxthausen's circle of friends.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=11\u201314}}</ref> Several of the storytellers were of [[Huguenot]] ancestry, telling tales of French origin such as those told to the Grimms by Marie Hassenpflug, an educated woman of French Huguenot ancestry,<ref name=\"H579\" /> and it is probable that these informants were familiar with Perrault's ''{{lang|fr|[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9]]}}'' (''Stories from Past Times'').<ref name=\"Jean\">{{Harvnb|Jean|2007|pp=280\u2013282}}</ref> Other tales were collected from [[Dorothea Viehmann]], the wife of a middle-class tailor and also of French descent. Despite her middle-class background, in the first English translation she was characterized as a peasant and given the name ''{{lang|de|Gammer Gretel}}''.<ref name=\"Txxxff\" />\n\n[[File:Walter Crane12.jpg|thumb|Stories such as \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\", shown here in a [[Walter Crane]] illustration, had been previously published and were rewritten by the Brothers Grimm.<ref name=\"Jean\" />]]\n\nAccording to scholars such as Ruth Bottigheimer and [[Maria Tatar]], some of the tales probably originated in written form during the [[Middle ages|medieval period]] with writers such as [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola|Straparola]] and [[Boccaccio]], but were modified in the 17th century and again rewritten by the Grimms. Moreover, Tatar writes that the brothers' goal of preserving and shaping the tales as something uniquely German at a time of [[Convention of Artlenburg|French occupation]] was a form of \"intellectual resistance\" and, in so doing, they established a methodology for collecting and preserving folklore that set the model followed later by writers throughout Europe during periods of occupation.<ref name=\"Txxxff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxiv\u2013xxxviii}}</ref><ref name=\"B175ff\">{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|pp=175}}</ref>\n\n==== Writing ====\nFrom 1807 onward, the brothers added to the collection. Jacob established the framework, maintained through many iterations; from 1815 until his death, Wilhelm assumed sole responsibility for editing and rewriting the tales. He made the tales stylistically similar, added dialogue, removed pieces \"that might detract from a rustic tone\", improved the plots, and incorporated psychological motifs.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\" /> Ronald Murphy writes in ''The Owl, the Raven and the Dove'' that the brothers\u2014and in particular Wilhelm\u2014also added religious and spiritual motifs to the tales. He believes that Wilhelm \"gleaned\" bits from [[Germanic paganism|old Germanic faiths]], Norse mythology, Roman and [[Greek mythology]], and biblical stories that he reshaped.<ref name=\"Murphy3ff\" />\n\nOver the years, Wilhelm worked extensively on the prose and expanded and added detail to the stories, to the point that many grew to twice the length they were in the earliest published editions.<ref name=\"T(2004)xiff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xi\u2013xiii}}</ref> In the later editions, Wilhelm polished the language to make it more enticing to a bourgeois audience, eliminated sexual elements, and added Christian elements. After 1819, he began writing for children (children were not initially considered the primary audience), adding entirely new tales or adding new elements to existing tales, elements that were often strongly didactic.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\" />\n\nSome changes were made in light of unfavorable reviews, particularly from those who objected that not all the tales were suitable for children because of scenes of violence and sexuality.<ref name=\"T(1987)15ff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|pp=15\u201317}}</ref> He worked to modify plots for many stories; for example, \"[[Rapunzel]]\" in the first edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' clearly shows a sexual relationship between the prince and the girl in the tower, which he edited out in subsequent editions.<ref name=\"T(2004)xiff\" /> Tatar writes that morals were added (in the second edition, a king's regret was added to the scene in which his wife is to be burned at the stake) and often the characters in the tale were amended to appear more German: \"every [[fairy]] (''{{lang|de|Fee}}''), prince (''{{lang|de|Prinz}}'') and princess (''{{lang|de|Prinzessin}}'')\u2014all words of French origin\u2014was transformed into a more Teutonic-sounding enchantress (''{{lang|de|Zauberin}}'') or wise woman (''{{lang|de|weise Frau}}''), king's son (''{{lang|de|K\u00f6nigssohn}}''), king's daughter (''{{lang|de|K\u00f6nigstochter}}'').\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|p=31}}</ref>\n\n==== Themes and analysis ====\nThe Grimms' legacy contains legends, [[novella]]s, and folk stories, the vast majority of which were not intended as children's tales. Von Armin was deeply concerned about the content of some of the tales, such as those that showed children being eaten, and suggested that they be removed. Instead, the brothers added an introduction with cautionary advice that parents steer children toward age-appropriate stories. Despite von Armin's unease, none of the tales were eliminated from the collection, in the brothers' belief that all the tales were of value and reflected inherent cultural qualities. Furthermore, the stories were didactic in nature at a time when discipline relied on fear, according to scholar [[Linda D\u00e9gh]], who explains that tales such as \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\" and \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" were written as \"warning tales\" for children.<ref name=\"D91ff\">{{Harvnb|D\u00e9gh|1979|pp=91\u201393}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|left|\"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\", illustrated by [[Arthur Rackham]], was a \"warning tale\" for children.<ref name=\"D91ff\" />]]\n\nThe stories in ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' include scenes of violence that have since been sanitized. For example, in the Grimms' original version of \"[[Snow White]]\", the Queen is Little Snow White's mother, not her stepmother, yet even so she orders her Huntsman to kill Snow White (her biological daughter) and bring home the child's lungs and liver so that she can eat them. The story ends with the Queen mother dancing at Snow White's wedding wearing a pair of red-hot iron shoes that kill her.<ref>Jack Zipes's translation of the 1812 original edition of \"Folk and Fairy Tales\"</ref> Another story (\"The Goose Girl\") has a servant being stripped naked and pushed into a barrel \"studded with sharp nails\" pointing inwards and then rolled down the street.<ref name=\"NG\" /> The Grimms' version of \"[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]\" describes the princess throwing the frog against a wall instead of kissing him. To some extent, the cruelty and violence may have been a reflection of medieval culture from which the tales originated, such as scenes of witches burning, as described in \"[[The Six Swans]]\".<ref name=\"NG\" />\n\nTales with a spinning [[motif (folkloristics)|motif]] are broadly represented in the collection. In her essay \"Tale Spinners: Submerged Voices in Grimms' Fairy Tales\", children's literature scholar Bottigheimer explains that these stories reflect the degree to which spinning was crucial in the life of women in the 19th century and earlier. Spinning, and particularly the spinning of [[flax]], was commonly performed in the home by women. Many stories begin by describing the occupation of a main character, as in \"There once was a miller\", yet spinning is never mentioned as an occupation, probably because the brothers did not consider it an occupation. Instead, spinning was a communal activity, frequently performed in a ''{{lang|de|Spinnstube}}'' (spinning room), a place where women most likely kept the oral traditions alive by telling stories while engaged in tedious work.<ref name=\"B142ff\">{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|pp=142\u2013146}}</ref> In the stories, a woman's personality is often represented by her attitude toward spinning; a wise woman might be a spinster and Bottigheimer explains that the [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] was the symbol of a \"diligent, well-ordered womanhood.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|p=143}}</ref> In some stories, such as \"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\", spinning is associated with a threat; in others, spinning might be avoided by a character who is either too lazy or not accustomed to spinning because of her high social status.<ref name=\"B142ff\" /><!-- this needs more work; or develop in the KHM article -->\n\nThe tales were also criticized for being insufficiently German, which influenced the tales that the brothers included as well as their use of language. Scholars such as Heinz R\u00f6lleke say that the stories are an accurate depiction of German culture, showing \"rustic simplicity [and] sexual modesty.\"<ref name=\"NG\" /> German culture is deeply rooted in the forest (''{{lang|de|wald}}''), a dark dangerous place to be avoided, most particularly the old forests with large oak trees and yet a place where Little Red Riding Hood's mother sent her daughter to deliver food to her grandmother's house.<ref name=\"NG\" /><!-- either something got lost here or it needs expansion -->\n\n[[File:Rumpelstiltskin-Crane1886.jpg|thumb|300px|\"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\", shown here in an illustrated border by [[Walter Crane]], is an example of a \"spinning tale\".]]\n\nSome critics such as Alistair Hauke use [[Analytical psychology|Jungian analysis]] to say that the deaths of the brothers' father and grandfather are the reason for the Grimms' tendency to idealize and excuse fathers, as well as the predominance of female villains in the tales, such as the [[wicked stepmother]] and stepsisters in \"Cinderella\", but this disregards the fact that they were collectors, not authors of the tales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alister|Hauke|1998|pp=216\u2013219}}</ref> Another possible influence is found in stories such as \"[[The Twelve Brothers]]\", which mirrors the brothers' family structure of several brothers facing and overcoming opposition.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|p=37}}</ref> Autobiographical elements exist in some of the tales, and according to Zipes the work may have been a \"quest\" to replace the family life lost after their father died. The collection includes 41 tales about siblings, which Zipes says are representative of Jacob and Wilhelm. Many of the sibling stories follow a simple plot where the characters lose a home, work industriously at a specific task and, in the end, find a new home.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=39\u201342}}</ref>\n\n==== Editions ====\nBetween 1812 and 1864, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' was published 17 times: seven of the \"Large edition\" (''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Ausgabe}}'') and ten of the \"Small edition\" (''{{lang|de|Kleine Ausgabe}}''). The Large editions contained all the tales collected to date, extensive annotations, and scholarly notes written by the brothers; the Small editions had only 50 tales and were intended for children. Jacob and Wilhelm's younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Emil Grimm]] illustrated the Small editions, adding Christian symbolism to the drawings, such as depicting Cinderella's mother as an angel, and adding a Bible to the bedside table of Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\n[[File:Kinder title page.jpg|thumb|300px|Frontispiece and title-page, illustrated by [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]] of the 1819 edition of ''{{lang|de|[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]}}'']]\n[[File:Grimm - Deutsche Sagen, 1912 - 2558595 F.jpeg|thumb|upright|''Deutsche Sagen'', 1912]]\n\nThe first volume was published in 1812 with 86 folk tales,<ref name=\"J177ff\">{{Harvnb|Joosen|2006|pp=177\u2013179}}</ref> and a second volume with 70 additional tales was published late in 1814 (dated 1815 on the title page); together, the two volumes and their 156 tales are considered the first of the Large (annotated) editions.<ref name=\"Michaelis-Jena\" /><ref name=\"Z(2000)276ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|pp=276\u2013278}}</ref> A second expanded edition with 170 tales was published in 1819, followed in 1822 by a volume of scholarly commentary and annotations.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /><ref name=\"T(1987)15ff\" /> Five more Large editions were published in 1837, 1840, 1843, 1850, and 1857.

They moved away from Brentano's practice\u2014and that of the other romanticists\u2014who frequently changed original oral styles of folk tale to a more literary style, which the brothers considered artificial.

The film ''[[The Brothers Grimm (film)|Brothers Grimm]]'' imagines them as con-artists exploiting superstitious German peasants until they are asked to confront a genuine fairy tale curse that calls them to finally be heroes.

''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]'' follows a detective who discovers he is a Grimm, the latest in a line of guardians who are sworn to keep the balance between humanity and mythological creatures. ''[[Ever After High]]'' imagines Grimm Brothers (here descendants called Milton and Giles) as headmasters of Ever After High boarding school where they train the children of the previous generation of fairy tales to follow in their parents' footsteps. The ''[[The 10th Kingdom|10th Kingdom]]'' mini series states that the brothers were trapped in the fairy tale world for years where they witnessed the events of their stories before finally making it back to the real world. ''[[The Sisters Grimm]]'' book series follows their descendants, Sabrina and Daphne, as they adapt to life in Ferryport Landing, a town in upstate New York populated by fairy tale people. Separate from the previous series are ''[[The Land of Stories]]'' and ''its'' Sisters Grimm, a self described [[coven]] determined to track down and document creatures from the fairy tale world that cross over into the real world.

They were among the first and best-known collectors of German and European folk tales, and popularized traditional oral tale types such as \"[[Cinderella]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Aschenputtel}}\"), \"[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Der Froschk\u00f6nig}}\"), \"[[The Goose-Girl]]\" (\"Die G\u00e4nsemagd\"), \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" (\"{{lang|de|H\u00e4nsel und Gretel}}\"), \"[[Rapunzel]]\", \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\", \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", \"[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats]]\", \"[[The Three Little Pigs]]\", \"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Rumpelstilzchen}}\"), \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Dornr\u00f6schen}}\"), and \"[[Snow White]]\" (\"{{lang|de|Schneewittchen}}\"). Their classic collection, ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Children's and Household Tales]]'' (''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}''), was published in two volumes\u2014the first in 1812 and the second in 1815.\n\nThe brothers were born in the town of [[Hanau]] in [[Hesse-Cassel]] (now Germany) and spent most of their childhood in the nearby town of [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]]. Their father's death in 1796 impoverished  the family and affected the brothers for many years after. They attended the [[University of Marburg]] where they began a lifelong dedication to researching the early history of German language and literature, including German [[Oral tradition|folktales]]. The rise of [[Romanticism]] during the 18th century had revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to the Grimms and their colleagues represented a pure form of national literature and culture. The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for [[folkloristics|folklore studies]]. Between the first edition of 1812\u20131815 and the seventh (and final) edition of 1857, they revised their collection many times, so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The original folk & fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm : the complete first edition|others=Grimm, Wilhelm, 1786-1859,, Grimm, Jacob, 1785-1863,, Zipes, Jack, 1937-, Dezs\u00f6, Andrea|isbn=9780691160597|location=Princeton [New Jersey]|oclc=879662315|year = 2014}}</ref> In addition to collecting and editing folk tales, the brothers compiled German legends. Individually, they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship. Together, in 1838, they began work on a massive historical German dictionary (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}}'') which, in their lifetimes, they completed only as far as the word ''Frucht'' ('fruit').\n\nMany of the Grimms' folk tales have enjoyed enduring popularity. The tales are available in more than 100 languages and have been adapted by filmmakers including [[Lotte Reiniger]] and [[Walt Disney]], with films such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. During the 1930s and 40s, the tales were used as propaganda by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]; later in the 20th century, psychologists such as [[Bruno Bettelheim]] reaffirmed the value of the work, in spite of the cruelty and violence in original versions of some of the tales (which the Grimms eventually sanitized).\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:SteinauBGHFrosch retouched.jpg|thumb|left|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm lived in this house in [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]] from 1791 to 1796.]]\n[[Jacob Grimm|Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm]] was born on 4&nbsp;January 1785, and his brother [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm Carl Grimm]] was born on 24&nbsp;February 1786. Both were born in [[Hanau]], in the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (present-day Germany), to [[Philipp Grimm|Philipp Wilhelm Grimm]], a [[jurist]], and Dorothea Grimm n\u00e9e Zimmer, daughter of a [[Kassel]] city councilman.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> They were the second- and third-eldest surviving siblings in a family of nine children, three of whom died in infancy.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /><ref>Frederick Herman George ({{lang|de|Friedrich Hermann Georg}}; 12 December 1783&nbsp;\u2013 16 March 1784), [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]], [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]], Carl Frederick ({{lang|de|Carl Friedrich}}; 24 April 1787&nbsp;\u2013 25 May 1852), Ferdinand Philip ({{lang|de|Ferdinand Philipp}}; 18 December 1788&nbsp;\u2013 6 January 1845), Louis Emil ({{lang|de|Ludwig Emil}}; 14 March 1790&nbsp;\u2013 4 April 1863), Frederick ({{lang|de|Friedrich}}; 15 June 1791&nbsp;\u2013 20 August 1792), Charlotte \"Lotte\" Amalie (10 May 1793&nbsp;\u2013 15 June 1833) and George Edward ({{lang|de|Georg Eduard}}; 26 July 1794&nbsp;\u2013 19 April 1795).</ref><ref name=\"Michaelis-Jena-9\">{{Harvnb|Michaelis-Jena|1970|p=9}}</ref> In 1791, the family moved to the countryside town of [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe|Steinau]], when Philipp was employed there as district [[magistrate]] (''{{lang|de|[[Amtmann]]}}'').  The family became prominent members of the community, residing in a large home surrounded by fields. Biographer [[Jack Zipes]] writes that the brothers were happy in Steinau and \"clearly fond of country life\".<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> The children were educated at home by private tutors, receiving strict instruction as [[Lutherans]] that instilled in both a lifelong religious faith.<ref>Herbert Scurla: Die Br\u00fcder Grimm, Berlin 1985, pp. 14\u201316</ref> Later, they attended local schools.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=2\u20135}}</ref>\n\nIn 1796, Philipp Grimm died of pneumonia, plunging his family into poverty, and they were forced to relinquish their servants and large house. Dorothea depended on financial support from her father and sister, who was the first [[lady-in-waiting]] at the court of [[William I, Elector of Hesse]]. Jacob was the eldest living son, and he was forced at age 11 to assume adult responsibilities (shared with Wilhelm) for the next two years. The two boys adhered to the advice of their grandfather, who continually exhorted them to be industrious.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" />\n\nThe brothers left Steinau and their family in 1798 to attend the ''{{lang|de|[[Friedrichsgymnasium Kassel|Friedrichsgymnasium]]}}'' in [[Kassel]], which had been arranged and paid for by their aunt. By then, they were without a male provider (their grandfather died that year), forcing them to rely entirely on each other, and they became exceptionally close. The two brothers differed in temperament; Jacob was introspective and Wilhelm was outgoing (although he often suffered from ill-health). Sharing a strong work ethic, they excelled in their studies. In Kassel, they became acutely aware of their inferior social status relative to \"high-born\" students who received more attention. Still, each brother graduated at the head of his class: Jacob in 1803 and Wilhelm in 1804.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /><ref name=\"Z(1988)31ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=31}}</ref>\n\n=== Kassel ===\nAfter graduation from the ''{{lang|de|Friedrichsgymnasium}}'', the brothers attended the [[University of Marburg]]. The university was small with about 200 students and there they became painfully aware that students of lower social status were not treated equally. They were disqualified from admission because of their social standing and had to request dispensation to study law. Wealthier students received stipends, but the brothers were excluded even from tuition aid. Their poverty kept them from student activities or university social life; ironically, however, their outsider status worked in their favor, and they pursued their studies with extra vigor.<ref name=\"Z(1988)31ff\" />\n\n[[File:Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm.png|thumb|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in an 1843 drawing by their younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]]]]\n\nThe brothers were inspired by their law professor [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Friedrich von Savigny]], who awakened in them an interest in history and [[philology]], and they turned to studying [[Middle High German literature|medieval German literature]].<ref name=\"Z(1988)35ff\" /> They shared Savigny's desire to see unification of the 200 German [[Principality|principalities]] into a single state. Through Savigny and his circle of friends\u2014[[German Romanticism|German romantics]] such as [[Clemens Brentano]] and [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]]\u2014the Grimms were introduced to the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who thought that German literature should revert to simpler forms, which he defined as ''{{lang|de|Volkspoesie}}'' (natural poetry) as opposed to ''{{lang|de|Kunstpoesie}}'' (artistic poetry).<ref name=\"Z(2002)7ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> The brothers dedicated themselves with great enthusiasm to their studies, about which Wilhelm wrote in his autobiography, \"the ardor with which we studied Old German helped us overcome the spiritual depression of those days.\"<ref name=\"Z(2002)7\">qtd. in {{Harvnb|Zipes|2002|p=7}}</ref>\n\nJacob was still financially responsible for his mother, brother, and younger siblings in 1805, so he accepted a post in Paris as research assistant to von Savigny. On his return to Marburg, he was forced to abandon his studies to support the family, whose poverty was so extreme that food was often scarce. He took a job with the Hessian War Commission. In a letter written to his aunt at this time, Wilhelm wrote of their circumstances, \"We five people eat only three portions and only once a day\".<ref name=\"Z(1988)35ff\">qtd. in {{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=35}}</ref>\n\nJacob found full-time employment in 1808 when he was appointed court librarian to the [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|King of Westphalia]] and went on to become librarian in Kassel.<ref name=\"Pitt\">{{cite web |last=Ashliman |first=D.L |title=Grimm Brothers Home Page |authorlink=D.

He arranged and paid for his brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Ludwig]]'s studies at art school and for Wilhelm's extended visit to [[Halle (Westfalen)|Halle]] to seek treatment for heart and respiratory ailments, following which Wilhelm joined Jacob as librarian in Kassel.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> The brothers also began collecting folk tales at about this time, in a cursory manner and on Brentano's request. According to Jack Zipes, at this point \"the Grimms were unable to devote all their energies to their research and did not have a clear idea about the significance of collecting folk tales in this initial phase.\"<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" />\n\nDuring their employment as librarians\u2014which paid little but afforded them ample time for research\u2014the brothers experienced a productive period of scholarship, publishing a number of books between 1812 and 1830.<ref name=\"Z218ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|pp=218\u2013219}}</ref> In 1812, they published their first volume of 86 folk tales, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'', followed quickly by two volumes of German legends and a volume of early literary history.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /> They went on to publish works about [[Danish folklore|Danish]] and [[Irish mythology|Irish]] folk tales and [[Norse mythology]], while continuing to edit the German folk tale collection. These works became so widely recognized that the brothers received honorary doctorates from universities in [[Marburg]], [[Berlin]], and Breslau (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]]).<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\n=== G\u00f6ttingen ===\nIn 1825, Wilhelm married Henriette Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild, a long-time family friend and one of a group who supplied them with stories. Jacob never married but continued to live in the household with Wilhelm and Dortchen.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=7\u20139}}</ref> In 1830, both brothers were overlooked when the post of chief librarian came available, which disappointed them greatly.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" /> They moved the household to [[G\u00f6ttingen]] in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] where they took employment at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], Jacob as a professor and head librarian and Wilhelm as professor.<ref name=\"Pitt\" />\n\n[[File:Im Kolleg bei Jacob Grimm 1830.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jacob Grimm lecturing (illustration by [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]], c. 1830)]]\n\nDuring the next seven years, the brothers continued to research, write, and publish. In 1835, Jacob published the well-regarded ''German Mythology'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mythologie]]}}''); Wilhelm continued to edit and prepare the third edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' for publication. The two brothers taught  [[German studies]] at the university, becoming well-respected in the newly established discipline.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\nIn 1837, they lost their university posts after joining the rest of the [[G\u00f6ttingen Seven]] in protest.. The 1830s were a period of political upheaval and peasant revolt in Germany, leading to the movement for democratic reform known as [[Young Germany]].  The Grimm brothers were not directly aligned with the Young Germans, but five of their colleagues reacted against the demands of [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]], who dissolved the parliament of [[Hanover]] in 1837 and demanded oaths of allegiance from civil servants\u2014including professors at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. For refusing to sign the oath, the seven professors were dismissed and three were deported from Hanover, including Jacob who went to Kassel. He was later joined there by Wilhelm, Dortchen, and their four children.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\nThe brothers were without income in 1838 and again in extreme financial difficulty, so they began what became a lifelong project: the writing of a definitive dictionary. The first volume of their ''German Dictionary'' (''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]}}'') was not published until 1854. The brothers again depended on friends and supporters for financial assistance and influence in finding employment.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\n=== Berlin and later years ===\n[[File:Graves of the Brothers Grimm at Alter St.-Matth\u00e4us-Kirchhof Berlin 2012.jpg|thumb|The graves of the Brothers Grimm in [[Sch\u00f6neberg]], Berlin (St. Matth\u00e4us Kirchhof Cemetery)]]\n\nIn 1840, von Savigny and Bettina von Arnim appealed successfully to [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] on behalf of the brothers who were offered posts at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. In addition to teaching posts, the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] offered them stipends to continue their research. Once they had established their household in Berlin, they directed their efforts towards the work on the German dictionary and continued to publish their research. Jacob turned his attention to researching German legal traditions and the history of the German language, which was published in the late 1840s and early 1850s; meanwhile, Wilhelm began researching [[medieval literature]] while editing new editions of  ''{{lang|de|Hausm\u00e4rchen}}''.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\nAfter the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], the brothers were elected to the civil parliament. Jacob became a prominent member of the National Assembly at [[Mainz]].<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" /> Their political activities were short-lived, as their hope dwindled for a unified Germany and their disenchantment grew.  In the late 1840s, Jacob resigned his university position and saw the publication of ''The History of the German Language'' (''{{lang|de|Geschichte der deutschen Sprache}}''). Wilhelm continued at his university post until 1852. After retiring from teaching, the brothers devoted themselves to the ''German Dictionary'' for the rest of their lives.<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" /> Wilhelm died of an infection in Berlin in 1859,<ref name=\"NG\" /> and Jacob became increasingly reclusive, deeply upset at his brother's death. He continued work on the dictionary until his own death in 1863. Zipes writes of the Grimm brothers' dictionary and of their very large body of work: \"Symbolically the last word was ''{{lang|de|Frucht}}'' (fruit).\"<ref name=\"Z(1988)7ff\" />\n\n== Collaborations ==\n\n=== ''Children's and Household Tales'' ===\n{{Main|Grimms' Fairy Tales}}\n\n==== Background ====\nThe rise of [[romanticism]], [[Romantic nationalism]], and trends in valuing popular culture in the early 19th century revived interest in fairy tales, which had declined since their late-17th-century peak.<ref name=\"Jean\" /> [[Johann Karl August Mus\u00e4us]] published a popular collection of tales between 1782 and 1787;<ref name=\"Haase2008\">{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=138}}</ref> the Grimms aided the revival with their folklore collection, built on the conviction that a national identity could be found in popular culture and with the common folk (''{{lang|de|Volk}}''). They collected and published their tales as a reflection of German cultural identity. In the first collection, though, they included [[Charles Perrault]]'s tales, published in Paris in 1697 and written for the [[salon (gathering)|literary salons]] of an aristocratic French audience. Scholar Lydie Jean says that Perrault created a myth that his tales came from the common people and reflected existing folklore to justify including them\u2014even though many of them were original.<ref name=\"Jean\" />\n\n[[File:Arthur Rackham Little Red Riding Hood+.jpg|thumb|left|The Grimms defined \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", shown here in an illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]], as representative of a uniquely German tale although it existed in various versions and regions.<ref name=\"Txxxviff\" />]]\n\nThe brothers were directly influenced by Brentano and von Arnim, who edited and adapted the folk songs of ''{{lang|de|[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]}}'' (''The Boy's Magic Horn'' or [[cornucopia]]).<ref name=\"Haase2008\" /> They began the collection with the purpose of creating a scholarly treatise of traditional stories and of preserving the stories as they had been handed from generation to generation\u2014a practice that was threatened by increased industrialization.<ref name=\"Txxxff\" /> [[Maria Tatar]], professor of German studies at [[Harvard University]], explains that it is precisely the handing from generation to generation and the genesis in the [[oral tradition]] that gives folk tales an important mutability. Versions of tales differ from region to region, \"picking up bits and pieces of local culture and lore, drawing a turn of phrase from a song or another story and fleshing out characters with features taken from the audience witnessing their performance.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxvi}}</ref>\n\nHowever, as Tatar explains, the Grimms appropriated stories as being uniquely German, such as \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", which had existed in many versions and regions throughout Europe, because they believed that such stories were reflections of Germanic culture.<ref name=\"Txxxviff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxviii}}</ref> Furthermore, the brothers saw fragments of old religions and faiths reflected in the stories, which they thought continued to exist and survive through the telling of stories.<ref name=\"Murphy3ff\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2000|pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\n==== Methodology ====\nWhen Jacob returned to Marburg from Paris in 1806, their friend Brentano sought the brothers' help in adding to his collection of folk tales, at which time the brothers began to gather tales in an organized fashion.<ref name=\"Z(1988)2ff\" /> By 1810, they had produced a manuscript collection of several dozen tales, written after inviting storytellers to their home and transcribing what they heard. These tales were heavily modified in transcription, and many had roots in previously written sources.<ref name=\"H579\">{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|p=579}}</ref> At Brentano's request, they printed and sent him copies of the 53 tales that they collected for inclusion in his third volume of ''{{lang|de|Des Knaben Wunderhorn}}''.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /> Brentano either ignored or forgot about the tales, leaving the copies in a church in [[Alsace]] where they were found in 1920 and became known as the \u00d6lenberg manuscript. It is the earliest extant version of the Grimms' collection and has become a valuable source to scholars studying the development of the Grimms' collection from the time of its inception. The manuscript was published in 1927 and again in 1975.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|p=62}}</ref>\n\nThe brothers gained a reputation for collecting tales from peasants, although many tales came from middle-class or aristocratic acquaintances. Wilhelm's wife Dortchen Wild and her family, with their nursery maid, told the brothers some of the more well-known tales, such as \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" and \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\".<ref name=\"J177ff\" /> Wilhelm collected a number of tales after befriending [[August von Haxthausen]], whom he visited in 1811 in [[Westphalia]] where he heard stories from von Haxthausen's circle of friends.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=11\u201314}}</ref> Several of the storytellers were of [[Huguenot]] ancestry, telling tales of French origin such as those told to the Grimms by Marie Hassenpflug, an educated woman of French Huguenot ancestry,<ref name=\"H579\" /> and it is probable that these informants were familiar with Perrault's ''{{lang|fr|[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9]]}}'' (''Stories from Past Times'').<ref name=\"Jean\">{{Harvnb|Jean|2007|pp=280\u2013282}}</ref> Other tales were collected from [[Dorothea Viehmann]], the wife of a middle-class tailor and also of French descent.

Moreover, Tatar writes that the brothers' goal of preserving and shaping the tales as something uniquely German at a time of [[Convention of Artlenburg|French occupation]] was a form of \"intellectual resistance\" and, in so doing, they established a methodology for collecting and preserving folklore that set the model followed later by writers throughout Europe during periods of occupation.<ref name=\"Txxxff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxiv\u2013xxxviii}}</ref><ref name=\"B175ff\">{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|pp=175}}</ref>\n\n==== Writing ====\nFrom 1807 onward, the brothers added to the collection. Jacob established the framework, maintained through many iterations; from 1815 until his death, Wilhelm assumed sole responsibility for editing and rewriting the tales. He made the tales stylistically similar, added dialogue, removed pieces \"that might detract from a rustic tone\", improved the plots, and incorporated psychological motifs.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\" /> Ronald Murphy writes in ''The Owl, the Raven and the Dove'' that the brothers\u2014and in particular Wilhelm\u2014also added religious and spiritual motifs to the tales. He believes that Wilhelm \"gleaned\" bits from [[Germanic paganism|old Germanic faiths]], Norse mythology, Roman and [[Greek mythology]], and biblical stories that he reshaped.<ref name=\"Murphy3ff\" />\n\nOver the years, Wilhelm worked extensively on the prose and expanded and added detail to the stories, to the point that many grew to twice the length they were in the earliest published editions.<ref name=\"T(2004)xiff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xi\u2013xiii}}</ref> In the later editions, Wilhelm polished the language to make it more enticing to a bourgeois audience, eliminated sexual elements, and added Christian elements. After 1819, he began writing for children (children were not initially considered the primary audience), adding entirely new tales or adding new elements to existing tales, elements that were often strongly didactic.<ref name=\"Z(1988)11ff\" />\n\nSome changes were made in light of unfavorable reviews, particularly from those who objected that not all the tales were suitable for children because of scenes of violence and sexuality.<ref name=\"T(1987)15ff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|pp=15\u201317}}</ref> He worked to modify plots for many stories; for example, \"[[Rapunzel]]\" in the first edition of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' clearly shows a sexual relationship between the prince and the girl in the tower, which he edited out in subsequent editions.<ref name=\"T(2004)xiff\" /> Tatar writes that morals were added (in the second edition, a king's regret was added to the scene in which his wife is to be burned at the stake) and often the characters in the tale were amended to appear more German: \"every [[fairy]] (''{{lang|de|Fee}}''), prince (''{{lang|de|Prinz}}'') and princess (''{{lang|de|Prinzessin}}'')\u2014all words of French origin\u2014was transformed into a more Teutonic-sounding enchantress (''{{lang|de|Zauberin}}'') or wise woman (''{{lang|de|weise Frau}}''), king's son (''{{lang|de|K\u00f6nigssohn}}''), king's daughter (''{{lang|de|K\u00f6nigstochter}}'').\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|1987|p=31}}</ref>\n\n==== Themes and analysis ====\nThe Grimms' legacy contains legends, [[novella]]s, and folk stories, the vast majority of which were not intended as children's tales. Von Armin was deeply concerned about the content of some of the tales, such as those that showed children being eaten, and suggested that they be removed. Instead, the brothers added an introduction with cautionary advice that parents steer children toward age-appropriate stories. Despite von Armin's unease, none of the tales were eliminated from the collection, in the brothers' belief that all the tales were of value and reflected inherent cultural qualities. Furthermore, the stories were didactic in nature at a time when discipline relied on fear, according to scholar [[Linda D\u00e9gh]], who explains that tales such as \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\" and \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" were written as \"warning tales\" for children.<ref name=\"D91ff\">{{Harvnb|D\u00e9gh|1979|pp=91\u201393}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|left|\"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\", illustrated by [[Arthur Rackham]], was a \"warning tale\" for children.<ref name=\"D91ff\" />]]\n\nThe stories in ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' include scenes of violence that have since been sanitized. For example, in the Grimms' original version of \"[[Snow White]]\", the Queen is Little Snow White's mother, not her stepmother, yet even so she orders her Huntsman to kill Snow White (her biological daughter) and bring home the child's lungs and liver so that she can eat them. The story ends with the Queen mother dancing at Snow White's wedding wearing a pair of red-hot iron shoes that kill her.<ref>Jack Zipes's translation of the 1812 original edition of \"Folk and Fairy Tales\"</ref> Another story (\"The Goose Girl\") has a servant being stripped naked and pushed into a barrel \"studded with sharp nails\" pointing inwards and then rolled down the street.<ref name=\"NG\" /> The Grimms' version of \"[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]\" describes the princess throwing the frog against a wall instead of kissing him. To some extent, the cruelty and violence may have been a reflection of medieval culture from which the tales originated, such as scenes of witches burning, as described in \"[[The Six Swans]]\".<ref name=\"NG\" />\n\nTales with a spinning [[motif (folkloristics)|motif]] are broadly represented in the collection. In her essay \"Tale Spinners: Submerged Voices in Grimms' Fairy Tales\", children's literature scholar Bottigheimer explains that these stories reflect the degree to which spinning was crucial in the life of women in the 19th century and earlier. Spinning, and particularly the spinning of [[flax]], was commonly performed in the home by women. Many stories begin by describing the occupation of a main character, as in \"There once was a miller\", yet spinning is never mentioned as an occupation, probably because the brothers did not consider it an occupation. Instead, spinning was a communal activity, frequently performed in a ''{{lang|de|Spinnstube}}'' (spinning room), a place where women most likely kept the oral traditions alive by telling stories while engaged in tedious work.<ref name=\"B142ff\">{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|pp=142\u2013146}}</ref> In the stories, a woman's personality is often represented by her attitude toward spinning; a wise woman might be a spinster and Bottigheimer explains that the [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] was the symbol of a \"diligent, well-ordered womanhood.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bottigheimer|1982|p=143}}</ref> In some stories, such as \"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\", spinning is associated with a threat; in others, spinning might be avoided by a character who is either too lazy or not accustomed to spinning because of her high social status.<ref name=\"B142ff\" /><!-- this needs more work; or develop in the KHM article -->\n\nThe tales were also criticized for being insufficiently German, which influenced the tales that the brothers included as well as their use of language. Scholars such as Heinz R\u00f6lleke say that the stories are an accurate depiction of German culture, showing \"rustic simplicity [and] sexual modesty.\"<ref name=\"NG\" /> German culture is deeply rooted in the forest (''{{lang|de|wald}}''), a dark dangerous place to be avoided, most particularly the old forests with large oak trees and yet a place where Little Red Riding Hood's mother sent her daughter to deliver food to her grandmother's house.<ref name=\"NG\" /><!-- either something got lost here or it needs expansion -->\n\n[[File:Rumpelstiltskin-Crane1886.jpg|thumb|300px|\"[[Rumpelstiltskin]]\", shown here in an illustrated border by [[Walter Crane]], is an example of a \"spinning tale\".]]\n\nSome critics such as Alistair Hauke use [[Analytical psychology|Jungian analysis]] to say that the deaths of the brothers' father and grandfather are the reason for the Grimms' tendency to idealize and excuse fathers, as well as the predominance of female villains in the tales, such as the [[wicked stepmother]] and stepsisters in \"Cinderella\", but this disregards the fact that they were collectors, not authors of the tales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alister|Hauke|1998|pp=216\u2013219}}</ref> Another possible influence is found in stories such as \"[[The Twelve Brothers]]\", which mirrors the brothers' family structure of several brothers facing and overcoming opposition.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|p=37}}</ref> Autobiographical elements exist in some of the tales, and according to Zipes the work may have been a \"quest\" to replace the family life lost after their father died. The collection includes 41 tales about siblings, which Zipes says are representative of Jacob and Wilhelm. Many of the sibling stories follow a simple plot where the characters lose a home, work industriously at a specific task and, in the end, find a new home.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=39\u201342}}</ref>\n\n==== Editions ====\nBetween 1812 and 1864, ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen}}'' was published 17 times: seven of the \"Large edition\" (''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Ausgabe}}'') and ten of the \"Small edition\" (''{{lang|de|Kleine Ausgabe}}''). The Large editions contained all the tales collected to date, extensive annotations, and scholarly notes written by the brothers; the Small editions had only 50 tales and were intended for children. Jacob and Wilhelm's younger brother [[Ludwig Emil Grimm|Emil Grimm]] illustrated the Small editions, adding Christian symbolism to the drawings, such as depicting Cinderella's mother as an angel, and adding a Bible to the bedside table of Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother.<ref name=\"Z218ff\" />\n\n[[File:Kinder title page.jpg|thumb|300px|Frontispiece and title-page, illustrated by [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]] of the 1819 edition of ''{{lang|de|[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]}}'']]\n[[File:Grimm - Deutsche Sagen, 1912 - 2558595 F.jpeg|thumb|upright|''Deutsche Sagen'', 1912]]\n\nThe first volume was published in 1812 with 86 folk tales,<ref name=\"J177ff\">{{Harvnb|Joosen|2006|pp=177\u2013179}}</ref> and a second volume with 70 additional tales was published late in 1814 (dated 1815 on the title page); together, the two volumes and their 156 tales are considered the first of the Large (annotated) editions.<ref name=\"Michaelis-Jena\" /><ref name=\"Z(2000)276ff\">{{Harvnb|Zipes|2000|pp=276\u2013278}}</ref> A second expanded edition with 170 tales was published in 1819, followed in 1822 by a volume of scholarly commentary and annotations.<ref name=\"Pitt\" /><ref name=\"T(1987)15ff\" /> Five more Large editions were published in 1837, 1840, 1843, 1850, and 1857.

''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]'' follows a detective who discovers he is a Grimm, the latest in a line of guardians who are sworn to keep the balance between humanity and mythological creatures. ''[[Ever After High]]'' imagines Grimm Brothers (here descendants called Milton and Giles) as headmasters of Ever After High boarding school where they train the children of the previous generation of fairy tales to follow in their parents' footsteps. The ''[[The 10th Kingdom|10th Kingdom]]'' mini series states that the brothers were trapped in the fairy tale world for years where they witnessed the events of their stories before finally making it back to the real world. ''[[The Sisters Grimm]]'' book series follows their descendants, Sabrina and Daphne, as they adapt to life in Ferryport Landing, a town in upstate New York populated by fairy tale people. Separate from the previous series are ''[[The Land of Stories]]'' and ''its'' Sisters Grimm, a self described [[coven]] determined to track down and document creatures from the fairy tale world that cross over into the real world.

Most of Mount Diablo, including its peak, was within the homeland of the early [[Bay Miwok|Volvon]] (sometimes spelled Wolwon, Bolbon or Bolgon), a Bay Miwok-speaking tribe, and as early as 1811, the mountain was called (in Spanish) \"Cerro Alto de los Bolbones\" (High Point of the Volvon) or sometimes \"Sierra de los Bolgones\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://johnmarshhouse.com/park/native-americans/ |title=John Marsh Historic Trust}}</ref> The [[Nisenan]] of the Sacramento Valley called it Sukk\u00fa Jaman, or as Nisenan elder Dalbert Castro once explained, \"the place where dogs came from in trade\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.savemountdiablo.org/AboutMountDiablo.htm |title=About Mount Diablo |publisher=SaveMountDiablo.org |accessdate=November 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212222122/http://www.savemountdiablo.org/AboutMountDiablo.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}http://www.savemountdiablo.org/why_mtdiablohistory.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223657/http://www.savemountdiablo.org/why_mtdiablohistory.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nA Southern Miwok name for the mountain was ''Supemenenu''.

On August 24, 1828, the name was applied to the Monte del Diablo land grant for which Salvio Pacheco had petitioned in 1827. In May, 1862 California Geological Survey field director William H. Brewer named the northeast peak of Mount Diablo \"Mount King,\" after Rev.

Subsequent surveys in much of [[California]], [[Nevada]] and [[Oregon]] were located with reference to this point. [[Toll road]]s up the mountain were created in 1874 by Joseph Seavey Hall and William Camron (sometimes \"Cameron\"); Hall's Mount Diablo Summit Road was officially opened on May 2, 1874.  Camron's \"Green Valley\" road opened later.  Hall also built the 16-room Mountain House Hotel near the junction of the two roads, a mile below the summit (2,500 foot elevation, operated through the 1880s, abandoned 1895, burned c. 1901). As far north as Meridian Road, on the outskirts of [[Chico, California]], the summit was used as a reference point. The road is colinear with the summit, and is named for the meridian which intersects it.\n\nAn aerial [[navigation]] beacon, the Standard Diablo tower was erected by Standard Oil at the summit in 1928.<ref name=save_md/>  The 10-million-candlepower beacon<ref>A Standard ad (''Aviation Week'' October 30, 1961 p14) depicts a focused beam, unlike the present light.</ref> became known as the \"Eye of Diablo\" and was visible for a hundred miles.<ref name=\"MDIA\"/>\n\n===Parks and protection of land===\n[[File:MountDiablo.JPG|thumb|left|Mount Diablo from the Berkeley-Oakland hills]]\nAfter initial legislation in 1921, the state of California acquired enough land in 1931 to create a small state park around the peak. Many improvements were carried out in the 1930s by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] but park expansion slowed in the 1940s through the 1960s.  Significantly, botanist [[Mary Bowerman|Mary Leolin Bowerman]] (1908\u20132005), founder of Save Mount Diablo in 1971, published her Ph.D. dissertation in 1936 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and then in 1944 the book, ''The Flowering Plants and Ferns of Mount Diablo, California''. Her study boundaries became the basis for the state park's first map and for the park's eventual expansion, as well as the origin of many of the park's place names.<ref name=\"MDIA\"/>\n\nIn 1954 [[KOVR]] erected its television transmitter tower on the mountain.  One of the workers involved in the project said that parts of the tower were trucked up to the summit and assembled there. Based in Stockton, the station eventually became affiliated with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and was known for its popular \"Toonytown\" program hosted by [[Art Finley]]. With the completion of the mammoth television tower near [[Walnut Grove, California|Walnut Grove]], KOVR moved its transmitter there and later relocated its studios to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].\n\nThis initial park has been greatly expanded over the years.  Soon after Earth Day in 1971 the nonprofit organization \"Save Mount Diablo\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.savemountdiablo.org |title=Save Mount Diablo |publisher=SaveMountdiablo.org}}</ref> was created by co-founders Mary Bowerman and Art Bonwell, barely ahead of real estate developers. At the time, the state park included just {{convert|6788|acres}} and was the only park in the vicinity of the mountain. In 2007 the state park totaled almost {{convert|20,000|acres}}, and with 38 parks and preserves on and around the mountain, Diablo's public lands total more than {{convert|90000|acres}}. According to Save Mount Diablo there are actually 50 individual preserves on and around Mount Diablo, some conservation easements covering a single parcel, others expected to eventually be absorbed into larger nearby parks; as of December 2007, the organization recognizes 38 specific Diablo parks and preserves.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe State Park adjoins park lands of the [[East Bay Regional Park District]], including [[Morgan Territory]] Regional Preserve, [[Brushy Peak Regional Preserve]], [[Vasco Caves Regional Preserve]], and [[Round Valley Regional Preserve]]s. It also adjoins protected areas owned or controlled by local cities such as the [[Old Borges Ranch|Borges Ranch Historic Farm]], the [[Concord Naval Weapons Station]] (now in the process of being converted to non military use), Indian Valley, [[Shell Ridge Open Space]] and [[Lime Ridge Open Space]]s near [[Walnut Creek, California|city of Walnut Creek]], and east to the [[Los Vaqueros Reservoir]] watershed, The new [[Marsh Creek State Park]],{{efn|formerly known as Cowell Ranch State Park.}} and [[Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve]], are among the open spaces stretching back to the north. In this way the open spaces controlled by cities, the East Bay Regional Park District, Mount Diablo State Park, and various regional preserves now adjoin and protect much of the elevated regions of the mountain, with significant exceptions in Arroyo del cerro, Curry Canyon, the Marsh creek region and on the northern slopes of North Peak, and in a number of inholdings surrounded by preserve land.\n\n[[File:Franks Tract in Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta with Mount Diablo in background.JPG|right|thumb|Mount Diablo as seen from [[Franks Tract State Recreation Area|Franks Tract]] in the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]]]]\n\nPark expansion continues on all sides of the mountain although its western boundaries are largely complete. Extensive development continues in the southwestern foothills and Tassajara region, such as the upscale development of [[Blackhawk, California|Blackhawk]] and individual estates overlooking the Livermore Valley on Morgan Territory Road. Other large projects are proposed in the northern Black Diamond Mines and Los Medanos foothills, at the Concord Naval Weapons Station, and near Cowell Ranch State Park.  Large scale development of other private parcels is restricted by city and county urban limit lines, by lack of water, excessive slope and sensitive resources including rare species.  Smaller ranchette subdivisions continue to fragment and threaten many parcels and large areas of habitat.\n\n===Map of protected lands===\nIn 2007 Save Mount Diablo published ''Mount Diablo, Los Vaqueros & Surrounding Parks, Featuring the Diablo Trail'', the most accurate and up-to-date map of Mount Diablo's more than {{convert|90000|acres}} of protected lands, including 100 access points, {{convert|520|mi}} of trail and {{convert|400|mi}} of private fire roads. Updated acreages and trail mileages were discussed in accompanying press materials and news articles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.savemountdiablo.org/DiabloTrailMAPHomepage.htm |title=Mount Diablo, Los Vaqueros & Surrounding Parks, Featuring the Diablo Trail |publisher=SaveMountDiablo.org |accessdate=November 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602214220/http://www.savemountdiablo.org/DiabloTrailMAPHomepage.htm |archivedate=June 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}http://www.savemountdiablo.org/lands_map.html</ref>\n\n==Natural history==\n\n===Geology===\nMount Diablo is a geologic anomaly about {{convert|30|mi|-1}} east of San Francisco. The mountain is the result of geologic compression and uplift caused by the [[Plate tectonics|movements of the Earth's plates]]. The mountain lies between converging [[earthquake]] faults and continues to grow slowly. While the principal faults in the region are of the [[Strike-slip tectonics|strike-slip]] type, a significant thrust fault (with no surface trace) is found on the mountain's southwest flank. The uplift and subsequent weathering and erosion have exposed ancient oceanic [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] age rocks that now form the summit. The mountain grows from three to five millimeters each year.\n\nThe upper portion of the mountain is made up of volcanic and sedimentary deposits of what once was one or more island arcs of the [[Farallon Plate]] dating back to the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, between 90 and 190 million years ago. During this time, the Farallon Plate was subducting beneath the North American continent. These deposits were scraped off the top and accreted onto the North American Plate. This resulted in the highly distorted and fractured basalt and serpentine of the Mount Diablo Ophiolite and metasediments of the Franciscan complex around the summit. East of the subduction zone, a basin was filling with sediment from the ancestral Sierra further to the east. Up to 60,000 feet (18,000 m) of sandstone, mudstone, and limestone of the [[Great Valley Sequence]] were deposited from 66 to 150 million years ago. These deposits are now found faulted against the Ophiolite and Franciscan deposits.\n\n[[File:Fossilized seashells at the summit of Mt. Diablo, CA.jpg|thumb|left|Fossilized sea shells in the sandstone at the summit of Mt. Diablo (about 3,800' [[mean sea level|MSL]])]]Over the past 20 million years continental deposits have been periodically laid down and subsequently jostled around by the newly formed San Andreas Fault system, forming the Coast Ranges. Within the last four million years, local faulting has resulted in compression, folding, buckling, and erosion, bringing the various formations into their current juxtaposition. This faulting action continues to change the shape of Mount Diablo, along with the rest of the Coast Ranges.\n\nThe summit area of Mount Diablo is made up of deposits of gray [[sandstone]] (graywacke), [[chert]], oceanic volcanic [[basalts]] (greenstone) and a minor amount of [[shale]]. The hard red Franciscan chert is [[sedimentary]] in origin and rich in microscopic [[radiolaria]] [[fossil]]s and seashells. In the western foothills of the mountain there are large deposits of younger sandstone rocks also rich in seashells, severely tilted and in places forming dramatic ridgelines. Mount Diablo is a double pyramid and some{{who|date=January 2015}} say it resembles a volcano (which it isn't).\n\nDeposits of glassmaking-grade sand and lower-quality [[coal]] north of the mountain were mined in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but are now open to visitors as the [[Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve]]. Guided tours of the sand mines and coal field are provided.\n\n===Vegetation===\nThe park's vegetation is mixed [[oak]] woodland and savannah and open grassland with extensive areas of [[chaparral]] and a number of [[Endemism|endemic]] plant species, such as the [[Arctostaphylos auriculata|Mount Diablo manzanita]] (''Arctostaphylos auriculata''), [[Calochortus pulchellus|Mount Diablo fairy-lantern]] (''Calochortus pulchellus''), [[Campanula exigua|chaparral bellflower]] (''Campanula exigua''), [[Cordylanthus nidularius|Mount Diablo bird's beak]] (''Cordylanthus nidularius''), and [[Helianthella castanea|Mount Diablo sunflower]] (''Helianthella castanea''). The park includes substantial thickets, isolated examples, and mixed ground cover of [[Toxicodendron diversilobum|western poison oak]]. (It is best to learn the characteristics of this shrub and its toxin before hiking on narrow trails through brush and to be aware that it can be bare of leaves (but toxic to contact) in the winter.)\n\nAt higher altitudes and on north slopes is the widely distributed [[Pinus sabiniana|foothill pine]] (''Pinus sabiniana''). [[Pinus attenuata|Knobcone pine]] (''Pinus attenuata'') may be found along Knobcone Pine Road in the southern part of the park. The park and nearby [[Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve]] mark the northern extreme of the range of [[Coulter pine]] (''Pinus coulteri''). This species may be seen along the Coulter Pine Trail near the north (Mitchell Canyon) entrance.\n\nIn 2005 the [[endangered species]] [[Mount Diablo buckwheat]] (''Eriogonum truncatum''), thought to be extinct since last seen in 1936, was rediscovered in a remote area of the mountain.\n<gallery>\nFile:Pinus sabineana 00057.JPG|This ''[[Pinus sabiniana]]'' (foothill pine), the most common tree species in the park, is dwarfed by harsh conditions near the summit of Mount Diablo.\nFile:Pedicularis densiflora mt. diablo.JPG|''[[Pedicularis densiflora]]''\nFile:ARctostaphylos auriculata at Mt.

It is a chief remaining refuge for the [[threatened]] [[Alameda whipsnake]], [[California red-legged frog]]. Less common wildlife species include the reintroduced [[peregrine falcon]], [[ringtail cat]]s, and to the east [[American badger]]s, [[kit fox#Subspecies|San Joaquin kit fox]], [[roadrunners]], [[California tiger salamander]], and [[burrowing owl]]s.  There are also exotic (non-native) animals such as the [[red fox]] and [[opossum]], the latter being North America's only [[marsupial]].\n\nIn September and October male [[tarantula]] spiders can be seen (''[[Aphonopelma smithi]]'') as they seek a mate. These spiders are harmless unless severely provoked, and their bite is only as bad as a bee sting. More dangerous are [[Latrodectus|black widow spiders]], far less likely to be encountered in the open.\n\nIn the wintertime, between November and February, [[bald eagle]]s and [[golden eagle]]s are present. These birds are less easily seen than many raptors; golden eagles, particularly, fly at high elevations. Mount Diablo is part of the Altamont Area/Diablo Range, which enjoys the largest concentration of golden eagles anywhere. In recent years there have been credible sightings of California condors, which have been reintroduced at Pinnacles National Park, located to the south in the Gilroy-Hollister area.\n\nOf special note as potential hazards are [[Crotalus oreganus|Northern Pacific rattlesnake]]. While generally shy and non-threatening, one should be observant and cautious of where one steps to avoid accidentally disturbing one. They are often found warming themselves in the open (as on trails and ledges) on cool, sunny days. Other wildlife to avoid include fleas, ticks and mosquitoes.\n\nThere has also been an increase in the mountain lion population in the larger region and one should know how to respond if these animals are encountered. Please see the [[Cougar#Attacks on humans|''mountain lion safety tips'']] in the [[Cougar|Mountain lion]] article.\n<gallery>\nFile:Elanus leucurus 3.jpg|''[[Elanus leucurus]]''\nFile:AWonder Pacific Chorus Frog 001.jpg|Pacific chorus frog\nFile:Diadophis punctatus 3.jpg|''[[Diadophis punctatus]]''\nFile:Aspidoscelis tigris munda.jpg|''[[Aspidoscelis tigris]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Facilities==\n\n[[File:Mtdiablo01.jpg|thumb|right|Summit-building roof promenade and beacon tower, Mount Diablo, constructed by [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], 1939-42]]\nEntrance stations are located at the end of Northgate Road (in [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]]) and Diablo Road (in [[Danville, California|Danville]]).  The Danville entrance is also known as Southgate. If the entrance stations are not operating, park fees may be paid at the junction ranger station, where the two roads join.\n\nFrom here the road reaches the summit of the mountain, where there is a visitors center housing an observation deck and natural history exhibits. From the elevation of the lower lot the Mary Bowerman Trail is a level wheelchair-accessible path and boardwalk with interpretive stations that extends part way around the mountain; a regular single track trail completes the loop.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.savemountdiablo.org/DiabloWatch/2007SpringDiabloWatch.pdf |title=Mary Bowerman Trail |publisher=SaveMountDiablo.org |page=3 |newspaper=Diablo Watch |date=Spring 2007 |accessdate=November 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704165453/http://www.savemountdiablo.org/DiabloWatch/2007SpringDiabloWatch.pdf |archivedate=July 4, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}http://www.savemountdiablo.org/downloads/about_founder_Interview_of_Mary_Bowerman.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117020345/http://www.savemountdiablo.org/downloads/about_founder_Interview_of_Mary_Bowerman.pdf |date=November 17, 2015 }}</ref> There are {{convert|520|mi|km}} of [[hiking]] and equestrian trails, some available for [[mountain biking]].\n\n[[Camping]] facilities are available within the park. There are numerous picnic sites. Pets are restricted and require proper documentation for rabies (not just a tag). Daytime visitors must exit the park by sunset except for special events. Some picnic spots may be reserved but most are available without reservation.\n\nAlcohol is strictly forbidden in the park.  Fires are allowed only during the wet season (generally December through April), and only in sanctioned fire pits. The park may be closed on windy days during the dry season due to extremely hazardous fire conditions.\n\nTwo additional entrances with parking for hikers are provided on the northwest side of the park at Mitchell Canyon and Donner Canyon. Mitchell Canyon provides easy access to Black Point and Eagle Peak. Donner Canyon provides hikers access to Eagle Peak, Mount Olympia, North Peak, and the popular Falls Trail, which features several seasonal waterfalls.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Snow on Mt Diablo.jpg|thumb|center|740px|Snow on the peaks of Mount Diablo, as seen from Walnut Creek]]\nThe [[National Weather Service]] maintains a weather station at Mount Diablo Junction, 2,170 feet (661 m) above sea level.  The warmest month at the station is July with an average high of 85.2&nbsp;\u00b0F (29.5&nbsp;\u00b0C) and an average low of 59.6&nbsp;\u00b0F (15.3&nbsp;\u00b0C). The coolest month is January with an average high of 55.6&nbsp;\u00b0F (13.1&nbsp;\u00b0C) and an average low of 39.3\u00b0 (4.1&nbsp;\u00b0C). The highest temperature recorded there was 111&nbsp;\u00b0F (43.9&nbsp;\u00b0C) on July 15, 1972.  The lowest temperature on record was 14&nbsp;\u00b0F (-10&nbsp;\u00b0C) on February 6, 1989, and on December 14, 1990. (The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that the temperature dropped to 10&nbsp;\u00b0F (-12.2&nbsp;\u00b0C) at the summit on January 21, 1962.) Temperatures reach 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32.2&nbsp;\u00b0C) or higher on an average of 36.0 days each year and 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (37.8&nbsp;\u00b0C) or higher on 3.3 days each year. Lows of 32&nbsp;\u00b0F (0&nbsp;\u00b0C) or lower occur on an average of 15.4 days annually.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\nAnnual precipitation averages {{convert|23.96|in}}. The most precipitation recorded in a month was {{convert|13.54|in}} in February 1998. The greatest 24-hour precipitation was {{convert|5.02|in}} on January 21, 1972. The average annual days with measurable precipitation is 65.3 days.\n\nSnowfall at Mount Diablo Junction averages {{convert|1.2|in}} each year.  Prior to 2009, the most snowfall observed in a month was {{convert|17.0|in}} in April 1975; that same month saw {{convert|6.0|in}} in one day (April 4, 1975). The greatest snow depth was {{convert|3.0|in}} on January 27, 1972. Measurable snowfall does not occur every year, so the annual average days with measurable snowfall is only .5 days.  Snow is more common in the upper reaches of the mountain.  On December 7, 2009 Mount Diablo received a rare snow event of {{convert|18.0|in}}, receiving more in one day than what it normally receives in one year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/12/08/MNMB1B0B19.DTL|title=Rare dusting of snow at low elevations |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=December 11, 2009 | first=Kevin | last=Fagan}}</ref>\n\n===Data-collecting note===\n\nThe Mt. Diablo Junction weather station is positioned at only about 55 percent of the mountain's height. Temperatures and snow levels are notably different than at the upper reaches of the mountain, where lower temperatures and greater snowfall may have occurred, but simply have not been recorded. Nearby Bay Area mountains, like [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], have their weather stations at or near the summit. This is why recorded snow levels on Mount Hamilton are much higher than the ones recorded at Mount Diablo Junction, even though the difference in height of Mount Hamilton and Mount Diablo is only about {{convert|400|ft|-1}}.\n\nThree conditions are measured at the actual summit, however: wind speed, wind direction and temperature; and are available by an automatic telephone voice response system. Recorded information concerning gate open times, road and pet restrictions, and events is available at another number. These numbers are posted at the park website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=517 |title=Mount Diablo State Park|publisher=California State Parks|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{weather box|\n|location = Mt.

Early work centered on exploration, surveying and was related to the rise and popularization of tourism in the Pacific west. Themes were suggested and heightened by early tourism promoters, the beginnings of the area's preservation and the rise of the environmental movement. The focus was accelerated by artists associated with the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the California College of Arts, the actions of the organizations Save Mount Diablo and the Mount Diablo Interpretive Association, and area art centers, galleries, and museums. In modern times Mount Diablo art has been most strongly represented in plein aire painting, especially the group Artists for Action, and photography.\n\nRepresentative work includes books and articles by classical writers such as William Brewer, [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]], [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]], [[Bret Harte]], and the Reverend [[Thomas Starr King]], and modern ones such as Mark Allen Cunningham. Poets whose work features the mountain include [[Philip Lamantia]], Andrew Schelling, and Helen Pinkerton.\n\nEarly painters include Thomas Almond Ayres, Eugene Camerer, W. H. Dougal, Eduard Hildebrandt, Charles Hittell, [[Edward Jump]], William Keith, [[John Ross Key]], Charles Koppel, Edward Lehman, Pascal Loomis, Henry Miller, Joseph Warren Revere, through Clarkson Dye and others, to modern painters such as Robert Becker, Frank J. Bette, Ruth Breve, Betty Boggess Lathrap, Paul Carey, Bob Chapla, Mary Lou Correia, Ellen Curtis, Pam Della, Susan Dennis, Warren Dreher, John Finger, Pam Glover, JoAnn Hanna, Peg Humphreys, Don Irwin, Jeanne Kapp, Geri Keary, Chris Kent, Paul Kratter, Eunice Kritscher, Fred Martin, Cathy Moloney, Shirley Nootbaar, Charlotte Panton, Greg Piatt, Kenneth Potter, Robin Purcell, Ocean Quigley, Don Reich, Mary Silverwood, Barbara Stanton, Bruce Stangeland, Marty Stanley, and even the recognized comic book painter [[Dan Brereton]].\n\nPhotographers include [[Ansel Adams]], Cleet Carlton, Alfred A. Hart, Scott Hein, Stephen Joseph, Don Paulson, Brad Perks, Robert Picker, Richard Rollins, David Sanger, Michael Sewell and Bob Walker.\n\nThe mountain has inspired musical artists ranging from the [[Kronos Quartet]] to commissioned works by the [[California Symphony]]. The pop-punk band [[The Story So Far (band)|The Story So Far]], who are from the area, have a song titled Mt. Diablo.\n\nThe mountain's name is the source for the \"Devils\" part of the name of the [[Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps]], a 17 time Drum Corps International world champion corps, founded and based in Concord, California since 1957.\n\n[[David Brevik]], head of [[Blizzard North]], got the idea for the name of the [[Diablo (series)|Diablo game franchise]] from Mt.

Arishem and the others sealed him away beneath the Diablo Mountain Range in California. See Fantastic Four Vol 1 #339 and #340.\n\n==Famous residents==\n\nMount Diablo has been the home of a number of famous residents.\n\n[[James \"Grizzly\" Adams]] was a frequent visitor and resident on Mount Diablo in the mid-1850s.<ref name=cchs/>\n\n[[Bob Jones (third baseman)|Robert Walter \"Bob\" Jones]], the first professional baseball player from Contra Costa County, was born in the \"Jones House\" in Irish Canyon in 1889, a current acquisition project of Save Mount Diablo.\n\nThe Mount Diablo Ranch, or Diablo Ranch, was successively owned by Robert Noble Burgess (b. 1878 - d. 1965), who founded the community of Diablo and built the mountain's first auto roads, and millionaire Walter Paul Frick (aka W.P. Frick, b. 1875 - d. 1937), who lived in Diablo and was important in the creation of the State Park in 1931, including sale of six of the first seven parcels for the new park.\n\nJazz pianist [[Dave Brubeck]] grew up on Brubeck Ranch near the park's Northgate entrance.\n\nThe area for the {{convert|6500|acre|0|adj=on}} Blackhawk Farm, including the mountain's southern Black Hills, was acquired from Burgess and created by Ansel Mills Easton, the namesake uncle of photographer Ansel Adams. Eventually nearly two-thirds of the farm was added to Mount Diablo State Park.  The remainder was developed as the community of [[Blackhawk, California|Blackhawk]] by resident developer [[Ken Behring]].\n\n==Legends and folklore==\n\nMount Diablo has long been the site of numerous reports pertaining to [[cryptozoology]], [[ghost|hauntings]], [[Will-o'-the-wisp|mysterious lights]], and various other [[Forteana#Fortean phenomena|Fortean phenomena]] (it is rumored that the name \"''Mount Diablo''\" is derived from the propensity for such weird events to be alleged at, or in the immediate vicinity of, the mountain).

The public is welcome and visitors on this day should enter the park before 4:00 PM<!--Recommended 4:30 does not give enough time-->. General parking will be at the lower lot on these days, with a short uphill walk by trail or road to the summit. Visitors may leave later than usual &mdash; this is one of the few opportunities to view the sunset from the peak, weather permitting, without either an overnight stay or a hike to the summit from outside the gates.\n\nUnder cloudless conditions, more interesting than the sunset itself is the view of the progression of the mountain's shadow across the [[California Central Valley]] to the distant [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], finally appearing for a few moments above the horizon as a shadow in the post-sunset sky glow.\n\nIn April 1946, an Army C-45 transport plane crashed on the north side of the mountain, killing the pilot and co-pilot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Diablo_C-45F_crash_site.htm |title=The Crash of the C-45F on Mt.

Snow occurs from the lower reaches of the park all the way to the peak, as was the case in February 2001 and February and March 2006. On Friday, March 10, 2006, an extremely cold storm moved into the region from the [[Gulf of Alaska]], and noticeable amounts of snow fell in all regions of the Bay Area above 500 feet (152 m). The summit of the mountain received around six inches (15&nbsp;cm) of snow at its peak, and the access roads were closed to automobiles at the 3,000 feet (914 m) mark due to the hazardous icy conditions above.\n\nOccasionally there will be public access to astronomical observations made by a local astronomy club.

On August 24, 1828, the name was applied to the Monte del Diablo land grant for which Salvio Pacheco had petitioned in 1827. In May, 1862 California Geological Survey field director William H.

Eventually, the [[U.S. Board on Geographic Names]] rejected the petitions, saying there was no compelling reason to change the name.\n\nIn 2009 Mijares again proposed the name Mount Reagan to the United States Board of Geographic Names because Reagan was now eligible.<ref name=\"DiablotoReagan\"/> The board gave the Contra Costa County Supervisor's Committee until March 31 to file an opinion.

Subsequent surveys in much of [[California]], [[Nevada]] and [[Oregon]] were located with reference to this point. [[Toll road]]s up the mountain were created in 1874 by Joseph Seavey Hall and William Camron (sometimes \"Cameron\"); Hall's Mount Diablo Summit Road was officially opened on May 2, 1874.  Camron's \"Green Valley\" road opened later.  Hall also built the 16-room Mountain House Hotel near the junction of the two roads, a mile below the summit (2,500 foot elevation, operated through the 1880s, abandoned 1895, burned c. 1901). As far north as Meridian Road, on the outskirts of [[Chico, California]], the summit was used as a reference point. The road is colinear with the summit, and is named for the meridian which intersects it.\n\nAn aerial [[navigation]] beacon, the Standard Diablo tower was erected by Standard Oil at the summit in 1928.<ref name=save_md/>  The 10-million-candlepower beacon<ref>A Standard ad (''Aviation Week'' October 30, 1961 p14) depicts a focused beam, unlike the present light.</ref> became known as the \"Eye of Diablo\" and was visible for a hundred miles.<ref name=\"MDIA\"/>\n\n===Parks and protection of land===\n[[File:MountDiablo.JPG|thumb|left|Mount Diablo from the Berkeley-Oakland hills]]\nAfter initial legislation in 1921, the state of California acquired enough land in 1931 to create a small state park around the peak. Many improvements were carried out in the 1930s by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] but park expansion slowed in the 1940s through the 1960s.  Significantly, botanist [[Mary Bowerman|Mary Leolin Bowerman]] (1908\u20132005), founder of Save Mount Diablo in 1971, published her Ph.D. dissertation in 1936 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and then in 1944 the book, ''The Flowering Plants and Ferns of Mount Diablo, California''. Her study boundaries became the basis for the state park's first map and for the park's eventual expansion, as well as the origin of many of the park's place names.<ref name=\"MDIA\"/>\n\nIn 1954 [[KOVR]] erected its television transmitter tower on the mountain.  One of the workers involved in the project said that parts of the tower were trucked up to the summit and assembled there. Based in Stockton, the station eventually became affiliated with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and was known for its popular \"Toonytown\" program hosted by [[Art Finley]]. With the completion of the mammoth television tower near [[Walnut Grove, California|Walnut Grove]], KOVR moved its transmitter there and later relocated its studios to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].\n\nThis initial park has been greatly expanded over the years.  Soon after Earth Day in 1971 the nonprofit organization \"Save Mount Diablo\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.savemountdiablo.org |title=Save Mount Diablo |publisher=SaveMountdiablo.org}}</ref> was created by co-founders Mary Bowerman and Art Bonwell, barely ahead of real estate developers. At the time, the state park included just {{convert|6788|acres}} and was the only park in the vicinity of the mountain. In 2007 the state park totaled almost {{convert|20,000|acres}}, and with 38 parks and preserves on and around the mountain, Diablo's public lands total more than {{convert|90000|acres}}. According to Save Mount Diablo there are actually 50 individual preserves on and around Mount Diablo, some conservation easements covering a single parcel, others expected to eventually be absorbed into larger nearby parks; as of December 2007, the organization recognizes 38 specific Diablo parks and preserves.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe State Park adjoins park lands of the [[East Bay Regional Park District]], including [[Morgan Territory]] Regional Preserve, [[Brushy Peak Regional Preserve]], [[Vasco Caves Regional Preserve]], and [[Round Valley Regional Preserve]]s. It also adjoins protected areas owned or controlled by local cities such as the [[Old Borges Ranch|Borges Ranch Historic Farm]], the [[Concord Naval Weapons Station]] (now in the process of being converted to non military use), Indian Valley, [[Shell Ridge Open Space]] and [[Lime Ridge Open Space]]s near [[Walnut Creek, California|city of Walnut Creek]], and east to the [[Los Vaqueros Reservoir]] watershed, The new [[Marsh Creek State Park]],{{efn|formerly known as Cowell Ranch State Park.}} and [[Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve]], are among the open spaces stretching back to the north. In this way the open spaces controlled by cities, the East Bay Regional Park District, Mount Diablo State Park, and various regional preserves now adjoin and protect much of the elevated regions of the mountain, with significant exceptions in Arroyo del cerro, Curry Canyon, the Marsh creek region and on the northern slopes of North Peak, and in a number of inholdings surrounded by preserve land.\n\n[[File:Franks Tract in Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta with Mount Diablo in background.JPG|right|thumb|Mount Diablo as seen from [[Franks Tract State Recreation Area|Franks Tract]] in the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]]]]\n\nPark expansion continues on all sides of the mountain although its western boundaries are largely complete. Extensive development continues in the southwestern foothills and Tassajara region, such as the upscale development of [[Blackhawk, California|Blackhawk]] and individual estates overlooking the Livermore Valley on Morgan Territory Road. Other large projects are proposed in the northern Black Diamond Mines and Los Medanos foothills, at the Concord Naval Weapons Station, and near Cowell Ranch State Park.  Large scale development of other private parcels is restricted by city and county urban limit lines, by lack of water, excessive slope and sensitive resources including rare species.  Smaller ranchette subdivisions continue to fragment and threaten many parcels and large areas of habitat.\n\n===Map of protected lands===\nIn 2007 Save Mount Diablo published ''Mount Diablo, Los Vaqueros & Surrounding Parks, Featuring the Diablo Trail'', the most accurate and up-to-date map of Mount Diablo's more than {{convert|90000|acres}} of protected lands, including 100 access points, {{convert|520|mi}} of trail and {{convert|400|mi}} of private fire roads. Updated acreages and trail mileages were discussed in accompanying press materials and news articles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.savemountdiablo.org/DiabloTrailMAPHomepage.htm |title=Mount Diablo, Los Vaqueros & Surrounding Parks, Featuring the Diablo Trail |publisher=SaveMountDiablo.org |accessdate=November 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602214220/http://www.savemountdiablo.org/DiabloTrailMAPHomepage.htm |archivedate=June 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}http://www.savemountdiablo.org/lands_map.html</ref>\n\n==Natural history==\n\n===Geology===\nMount Diablo is a geologic anomaly about {{convert|30|mi|-1}} east of San Francisco. The mountain is the result of geologic compression and uplift caused by the [[Plate tectonics|movements of the Earth's plates]]. The mountain lies between converging [[earthquake]] faults and continues to grow slowly. While the principal faults in the region are of the [[Strike-slip tectonics|strike-slip]] type, a significant thrust fault (with no surface trace) is found on the mountain's southwest flank. The uplift and subsequent weathering and erosion have exposed ancient oceanic [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] age rocks that now form the summit. The mountain grows from three to five millimeters each year.\n\nThe upper portion of the mountain is made up of volcanic and sedimentary deposits of what once was one or more island arcs of the [[Farallon Plate]] dating back to the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, between 90 and 190 million years ago. During this time, the Farallon Plate was subducting beneath the North American continent. These deposits were scraped off the top and accreted onto the North American Plate. This resulted in the highly distorted and fractured basalt and serpentine of the Mount Diablo Ophiolite and metasediments of the Franciscan complex around the summit. East of the subduction zone, a basin was filling with sediment from the ancestral Sierra further to the east. Up to 60,000 feet (18,000 m) of sandstone, mudstone, and limestone of the [[Great Valley Sequence]] were deposited from 66 to 150 million years ago. These deposits are now found faulted against the Ophiolite and Franciscan deposits.\n\n[[File:Fossilized seashells at the summit of Mt. Diablo, CA.jpg|thumb|left|Fossilized sea shells in the sandstone at the summit of Mt. Diablo (about 3,800' [[mean sea level|MSL]])]]Over the past 20 million years continental deposits have been periodically laid down and subsequently jostled around by the newly formed San Andreas Fault system, forming the Coast Ranges. Within the last four million years, local faulting has resulted in compression, folding, buckling, and erosion, bringing the various formations into their current juxtaposition. This faulting action continues to change the shape of Mount Diablo, along with the rest of the Coast Ranges.\n\nThe summit area of Mount Diablo is made up of deposits of gray [[sandstone]] (graywacke), [[chert]], oceanic volcanic [[basalts]] (greenstone) and a minor amount of [[shale]]. The hard red Franciscan chert is [[sedimentary]] in origin and rich in microscopic [[radiolaria]] [[fossil]]s and seashells. In the western foothills of the mountain there are large deposits of younger sandstone rocks also rich in seashells, severely tilted and in places forming dramatic ridgelines. Mount Diablo is a double pyramid and some{{who|date=January 2015}} say it resembles a volcano (which it isn't).\n\nDeposits of glassmaking-grade sand and lower-quality [[coal]] north of the mountain were mined in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but are now open to visitors as the [[Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve]]. Guided tours of the sand mines and coal field are provided.\n\n===Vegetation===\nThe park's vegetation is mixed [[oak]] woodland and savannah and open grassland with extensive areas of [[chaparral]] and a number of [[Endemism|endemic]] plant species, such as the [[Arctostaphylos auriculata|Mount Diablo manzanita]] (''Arctostaphylos auriculata''), [[Calochortus pulchellus|Mount Diablo fairy-lantern]] (''Calochortus pulchellus''), [[Campanula exigua|chaparral bellflower]] (''Campanula exigua''), [[Cordylanthus nidularius|Mount Diablo bird's beak]] (''Cordylanthus nidularius''), and [[Helianthella castanea|Mount Diablo sunflower]] (''Helianthella castanea''). The park includes substantial thickets, isolated examples, and mixed ground cover of [[Toxicodendron diversilobum|western poison oak]]. (It is best to learn the characteristics of this shrub and its toxin before hiking on narrow trails through brush and to be aware that it can be bare of leaves (but toxic to contact) in the winter.)\n\nAt higher altitudes and on north slopes is the widely distributed [[Pinus sabiniana|foothill pine]] (''Pinus sabiniana''). [[Pinus attenuata|Knobcone pine]] (''Pinus attenuata'') may be found along Knobcone Pine Road in the southern part of the park. The park and nearby [[Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve]] mark the northern extreme of the range of [[Coulter pine]] (''Pinus coulteri''). This species may be seen along the Coulter Pine Trail near the north (Mitchell Canyon) entrance.\n\nIn 2005 the [[endangered species]] [[Mount Diablo buckwheat]] (''Eriogonum truncatum''), thought to be extinct since last seen in 1936, was rediscovered in a remote area of the mountain.\n<gallery>\nFile:Pinus sabineana 00057.JPG|This ''[[Pinus sabiniana]]'' (foothill pine), the most common tree species in the park, is dwarfed by harsh conditions near the summit of Mount Diablo.\nFile:Pedicularis densiflora mt. diablo.JPG|''[[Pedicularis densiflora]]''\nFile:ARctostaphylos auriculata at Mt.

It is a chief remaining refuge for the [[threatened]] [[Alameda whipsnake]], [[California red-legged frog]]. Less common wildlife species include the reintroduced [[peregrine falcon]], [[ringtail cat]]s, and to the east [[American badger]]s, [[kit fox#Subspecies|San Joaquin kit fox]], [[roadrunners]], [[California tiger salamander]], and [[burrowing owl]]s.  There are also exotic (non-native) animals such as the [[red fox]] and [[opossum]], the latter being North America's only [[marsupial]].\n\nIn September and October male [[tarantula]] spiders can be seen (''[[Aphonopelma smithi]]'') as they seek a mate. These spiders are harmless unless severely provoked, and their bite is only as bad as a bee sting. More dangerous are [[Latrodectus|black widow spiders]], far less likely to be encountered in the open.\n\nIn the wintertime, between November and February, [[bald eagle]]s and [[golden eagle]]s are present. These birds are less easily seen than many raptors; golden eagles, particularly, fly at high elevations. Mount Diablo is part of the Altamont Area/Diablo Range, which enjoys the largest concentration of golden eagles anywhere. In recent years there have been credible sightings of California condors, which have been reintroduced at Pinnacles National Park, located to the south in the Gilroy-Hollister area.\n\nOf special note as potential hazards are [[Crotalus oreganus|Northern Pacific rattlesnake]]. While generally shy and non-threatening, one should be observant and cautious of where one steps to avoid accidentally disturbing one. They are often found warming themselves in the open (as on trails and ledges) on cool, sunny days. Other wildlife to avoid include fleas, ticks and mosquitoes.\n\nThere has also been an increase in the mountain lion population in the larger region and one should know how to respond if these animals are encountered. Please see the [[Cougar#Attacks on humans|''mountain lion safety tips'']] in the [[Cougar|Mountain lion]] article.\n<gallery>\nFile:Elanus leucurus 3.jpg|''[[Elanus leucurus]]''\nFile:AWonder Pacific Chorus Frog 001.jpg|Pacific chorus frog\nFile:Diadophis punctatus 3.jpg|''[[Diadophis punctatus]]''\nFile:Aspidoscelis tigris munda.jpg|''[[Aspidoscelis tigris]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Facilities==\n\n[[File:Mtdiablo01.jpg|thumb|right|Summit-building roof promenade and beacon tower, Mount Diablo, constructed by [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], 1939-42]]\nEntrance stations are located at the end of Northgate Road (in [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]]) and Diablo Road (in [[Danville, California|Danville]]).  The Danville entrance is also known as Southgate. If the entrance stations are not operating, park fees may be paid at the junction ranger station, where the two roads join.\n\nFrom here the road reaches the summit of the mountain, where there is a visitors center housing an observation deck and natural history exhibits. From the elevation of the lower lot the Mary Bowerman Trail is a level wheelchair-accessible path and boardwalk with interpretive stations that extends part way around the mountain; a regular single track trail completes the loop.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.savemountdiablo.org/DiabloWatch/2007SpringDiabloWatch.pdf |title=Mary Bowerman Trail |publisher=SaveMountDiablo.org |page=3 |newspaper=Diablo Watch |date=Spring 2007 |accessdate=November 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704165453/http://www.savemountdiablo.org/DiabloWatch/2007SpringDiabloWatch.pdf |archivedate=July 4, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}http://www.savemountdiablo.org/downloads/about_founder_Interview_of_Mary_Bowerman.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117020345/http://www.savemountdiablo.org/downloads/about_founder_Interview_of_Mary_Bowerman.pdf |date=November 17, 2015 }}</ref> There are {{convert|520|mi|km}} of [[hiking]] and equestrian trails, some available for [[mountain biking]].\n\n[[Camping]] facilities are available within the park. There are numerous picnic sites. Pets are restricted and require proper documentation for rabies (not just a tag). Daytime visitors must exit the park by sunset except for special events. Some picnic spots may be reserved but most are available without reservation.\n\nAlcohol is strictly forbidden in the park.  Fires are allowed only during the wet season (generally December through April), and only in sanctioned fire pits. The park may be closed on windy days during the dry season due to extremely hazardous fire conditions.\n\nTwo additional entrances with parking for hikers are provided on the northwest side of the park at Mitchell Canyon and Donner Canyon. Mitchell Canyon provides easy access to Black Point and Eagle Peak. Donner Canyon provides hikers access to Eagle Peak, Mount Olympia, North Peak, and the popular Falls Trail, which features several seasonal waterfalls.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Snow on Mt Diablo.jpg|thumb|center|740px|Snow on the peaks of Mount Diablo, as seen from Walnut Creek]]\nThe [[National Weather Service]] maintains a weather station at Mount Diablo Junction, 2,170 feet (661 m) above sea level.  The warmest month at the station is July with an average high of 85.2&nbsp;\u00b0F (29.5&nbsp;\u00b0C) and an average low of 59.6&nbsp;\u00b0F (15.3&nbsp;\u00b0C). The coolest month is January with an average high of 55.6&nbsp;\u00b0F (13.1&nbsp;\u00b0C) and an average low of 39.3\u00b0 (4.1&nbsp;\u00b0C). The highest temperature recorded there was 111&nbsp;\u00b0F (43.9&nbsp;\u00b0C) on July 15, 1972.  The lowest temperature on record was 14&nbsp;\u00b0F (-10&nbsp;\u00b0C) on February 6, 1989, and on December 14, 1990. (The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that the temperature dropped to 10&nbsp;\u00b0F (-12.2&nbsp;\u00b0C) at the summit on January 21, 1962.) Temperatures reach 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32.2&nbsp;\u00b0C) or higher on an average of 36.0 days each year and 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (37.8&nbsp;\u00b0C) or higher on 3.3 days each year. Lows of 32&nbsp;\u00b0F (0&nbsp;\u00b0C) or lower occur on an average of 15.4 days annually.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\nAnnual precipitation averages {{convert|23.96|in}}. The most precipitation recorded in a month was {{convert|13.54|in}} in February 1998. The greatest 24-hour precipitation was {{convert|5.02|in}} on January 21, 1972. The average annual days with measurable precipitation is 65.3 days.\n\nSnowfall at Mount Diablo Junction averages {{convert|1.2|in}} each year.  Prior to 2009, the most snowfall observed in a month was {{convert|17.0|in}} in April 1975; that same month saw {{convert|6.0|in}} in one day (April 4, 1975). The greatest snow depth was {{convert|3.0|in}} on January 27, 1972. Measurable snowfall does not occur every year, so the annual average days with measurable snowfall is only .5 days.  Snow is more common in the upper reaches of the mountain.  On December 7, 2009 Mount Diablo received a rare snow event of {{convert|18.0|in}}, receiving more in one day than what it normally receives in one year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/12/08/MNMB1B0B19.DTL|title=Rare dusting of snow at low elevations |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=December 11, 2009 | first=Kevin | last=Fagan}}</ref>\n\n===Data-collecting note===\n\nThe Mt. Diablo Junction weather station is positioned at only about 55 percent of the mountain's height. Temperatures and snow levels are notably different than at the upper reaches of the mountain, where lower temperatures and greater snowfall may have occurred, but simply have not been recorded. Nearby Bay Area mountains, like [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], have their weather stations at or near the summit. This is why recorded snow levels on Mount Hamilton are much higher than the ones recorded at Mount Diablo Junction, even though the difference in height of Mount Hamilton and Mount Diablo is only about {{convert|400|ft|-1}}.\n\nThree conditions are measured at the actual summit, however: wind speed, wind direction and temperature; and are available by an automatic telephone voice response system. Recorded information concerning gate open times, road and pet restrictions, and events is available at another number.

Early work centered on exploration, surveying and was related to the rise and popularization of tourism in the Pacific west. Themes were suggested and heightened by early tourism promoters, the beginnings of the area's preservation and the rise of the environmental movement. The focus was accelerated by artists associated with the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the California College of Arts, the actions of the organizations Save Mount Diablo and the Mount Diablo Interpretive Association, and area art centers, galleries, and museums. In modern times Mount Diablo art has been most strongly represented in plein aire painting, especially the group Artists for Action, and photography.\n\nRepresentative work includes books and articles by classical writers such as William Brewer, [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]], [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]], [[Bret Harte]], and the Reverend [[Thomas Starr King]], and modern ones such as Mark Allen Cunningham. Poets whose work features the mountain include [[Philip Lamantia]], Andrew Schelling, and Helen Pinkerton.\n\nEarly painters include Thomas Almond Ayres, Eugene Camerer, W. H. Dougal, Eduard Hildebrandt, Charles Hittell, [[Edward Jump]], William Keith, [[John Ross Key]], Charles Koppel, Edward Lehman, Pascal Loomis, Henry Miller, Joseph Warren Revere, through Clarkson Dye and others, to modern painters such as Robert Becker, Frank J. Bette, Ruth Breve, Betty Boggess Lathrap, Paul Carey, Bob Chapla, Mary Lou Correia, Ellen Curtis, Pam Della, Susan Dennis, Warren Dreher, John Finger, Pam Glover, JoAnn Hanna, Peg Humphreys, Don Irwin, Jeanne Kapp, Geri Keary, Chris Kent, Paul Kratter, Eunice Kritscher, Fred Martin, Cathy Moloney, Shirley Nootbaar, Charlotte Panton, Greg Piatt, Kenneth Potter, Robin Purcell, Ocean Quigley, Don Reich, Mary Silverwood, Barbara Stanton, Bruce Stangeland, Marty Stanley, and even the recognized comic book painter [[Dan Brereton]].\n\nPhotographers include [[Ansel Adams]], Cleet Carlton, Alfred A. Hart, Scott Hein, Stephen Joseph, Don Paulson, Brad Perks, Robert Picker, Richard Rollins, David Sanger, Michael Sewell and Bob Walker.\n\nThe mountain has inspired musical artists ranging from the [[Kronos Quartet]] to commissioned works by the [[California Symphony]]. The pop-punk band [[The Story So Far (band)|The Story So Far]], who are from the area, have a song titled Mt. Diablo.\n\nThe mountain's name is the source for the \"Devils\" part of the name of the [[Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps]], a 17 time Drum Corps International world champion corps, founded and based in Concord, California since 1957.\n\n[[David Brevik]], head of [[Blizzard North]], got the idea for the name of the [[Diablo (series)|Diablo game franchise]] from Mt. Diablo while living nearby.<ref name=\"Penny Arcade Expo\">\"To Hell and Back Again:How the Game Industry Has Changed Since Diablo,\" talk given by David Brevik at Penny Arcade Expo East on March 12, 2011.</ref>\n\nIn Marvel Comics, the Black Celestial named Tiamut was imprisoned under Mt Diablo for his crimes against the other Celestials. Arishem and the others sealed him away beneath the Diablo Mountain Range in California. See Fantastic Four Vol 1 #339 and #340.\n\n==Famous residents==\n\nMount Diablo has been the home of a number of famous residents.\n\n[[James \"Grizzly\" Adams]] was a frequent visitor and resident on Mount Diablo in the mid-1850s.<ref name=cchs/>\n\n[[Bob Jones (third baseman)|Robert Walter \"Bob\" Jones]], the first professional baseball player from Contra Costa County, was born in the \"Jones House\" in Irish Canyon in 1889, a current acquisition project of Save Mount Diablo.\n\nThe Mount Diablo Ranch, or Diablo Ranch, was successively owned by Robert Noble Burgess (b. 1878 - d. 1965), who founded the community of Diablo and built the mountain's first auto roads, and millionaire Walter Paul Frick (aka W.P. Frick, b. 1875 - d. 1937), who lived in Diablo and was important in the creation of the State Park in 1931, including sale of six of the first seven parcels for the new park.\n\nJazz pianist [[Dave Brubeck]] grew up on Brubeck Ranch near the park's Northgate entrance.\n\nThe area for the {{convert|6500|acre|0|adj=on}} Blackhawk Farm, including the mountain's southern Black Hills, was acquired from Burgess and created by Ansel Mills Easton, the namesake uncle of photographer Ansel Adams. Eventually nearly two-thirds of the farm was added to Mount Diablo State Park.  The remainder was developed as the community of [[Blackhawk, California|Blackhawk]] by resident developer [[Ken Behring]].\n\n==Legends and folklore==\n\nMount Diablo has long been the site of numerous reports pertaining to [[cryptozoology]], [[ghost|hauntings]], [[Will-o'-the-wisp|mysterious lights]], and various other [[Forteana#Fortean phenomena|Fortean phenomena]] (it is rumored that the name \"''Mount Diablo''\" is derived from the propensity for such weird events to be alleged at, or in the immediate vicinity of, the mountain).  [[Phantom cat|Phantom]] black \"[[Black panther|panthers]]\" are seen with unusual frequency on the slopes of the mountain, as well as at the \"''Devil's Hole''\" region of the [[Las Trampas Regional Wilderness]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  As early as 1806, [[General officer|General]] [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]] (July 4, 1807 \u2013 January 18, 1890) reported an encounter with a flying, spectral apparition, while engaged in military operations against the ''Bolgones'' band of the [[Bay Miwok]] tribe.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  In 1873, a live [[frog]] was said to be found within a slab of [[limestone]] at a [[mining|mine]] on Mount Diablo.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mysterious America |first=Loren |last=Coleman |authorlink=Loren Coleman |year=2007 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |page=25 |isbn=1-4165-2736-2}}</ref>\n\n==Events==\n[[File:Mt Diablo Summit Visitor Center.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the summit visitor center showing the renewed aircraft beacon]]\nEach Fall the male tarantulas of Mt. Diablo emerge from their burrows to seek mates. The Mt. Diablo Interpretive Association offers guided hikes to observe the migration.<ref name=mdia_tt/> The \"March of the Tarantulas\" can begin as early as August and last through October.<ref name=ktvu2014/>\n\nEvery year on December 7 the aircraft beacon atop the summit building is illuminated from sunset to dawn. A ceremony memorializing the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on this day in 1941 is held at the summit, with some of the few remaining survivors who are present. The public is welcome and visitors on this day should enter the park before 4:00 PM<!--Recommended 4:30 does not give enough time-->. General parking will be at the lower lot on these days, with a short uphill walk by trail or road to the summit. Visitors may leave later than usual &mdash; this is one of the few opportunities to view the sunset from the peak, weather permitting, without either an overnight stay or a hike to the summit from outside the gates.\n\nUnder cloudless conditions, more interesting than the sunset itself is the view of the progression of the mountain's shadow across the [[California Central Valley]] to the distant [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], finally appearing for a few moments above the horizon as a shadow in the post-sunset sky glow.\n\nIn April 1946, an Army C-45 transport plane crashed on the north side of the mountain, killing the pilot and co-pilot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Diablo_C-45F_crash_site.htm |title=The Crash of the C-45F on Mt. Diablo |publisher=Check-Six.com |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Save Mount Diablo'' sponsors many spring and fall schedules of events on the mountain, Spring on Diablo and Autumn on Diablo, as well as many other special events, including its anniversary event, Moonlight on the Mountain; Four Days Diablo, a trip on the Diablo Trail; the Mount Diablo Challenge, an annual [[Hill climbing (cycling)|hill climb]]  to the summit with more than 1,100 cyclists each October; and the Mount Diablo Trail Adventure, combined 10k and half-marathon hikes and runs.\n\nThe park is popular in winter, when Bay Area residents can enjoy the rare experience of snowfall on the mountain. Snow occurs from the lower reaches of the park all the way to the peak, as was the case in February 2001 and February and March 2006. On Friday, March 10, 2006, an extremely cold storm moved into the region from the [[Gulf of Alaska]], and noticeable amounts of snow fell in all regions of the Bay Area above 500 feet (152 m). The summit of the mountain received around six inches (15&nbsp;cm) of snow at its peak, and the access roads were closed to automobiles at the 3,000 feet (914 m) mark due to the hazardous icy conditions above.\n\nOccasionally there will be public access to astronomical observations made by a local astronomy club. This club was allocated a small parcel on the mountain and developed a permanent observatory at this location. The observatory has a computer-controlled telescope with a CCD camera.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mdas.net/mdoa/mdoa.htm | accessdate = August 4, 2013 | title = Mount Diablo Observatory Association, M.D.O.A.}}</ref>\n\n==Mount Diablo Challenge bicycle race==\n{{Infobox cycling hill climb\n| name = Mount Diablo\n| image = Mount Diablo Cyclist.jpg\n| image_size =\n| image_alt =\n| caption = A cyclist riding up Mount Diablo\n| location = \n| start = \n| end =\n| altitude_m = \n| altitude_ft = 3249\n| length_km = \n| length_mi = 10.8\n| max_elevation_m = 3849\n| max_elevation_ft =\n| gradient = 5.7\n| maxgradient = 13\n| website =\n| url =\n}}\nThe Mount Diablo Challenge is a bicycle race held annually on the first Sunday in October and benefiting non-profit, Save Mount Diablo's land preservation programs.

The race typically draws between 800 and 1,100 riders each year who compete in a mass-start format. Bicycle riders of every age and ability are represented in the diverse field, from weekend enthusiasts to top professionals. Prizes are typically awarded to the top overall male and female finishers, along with several age-specific categories.

The concept recognizes that \"the Internet is much more than infrastructure and applications, it is a network of economic and [[Social relation|social interactions]] and relationships, which has the potential to enable [[human rights]], empower individuals and communities, and facilitate [[sustainable development]]. The concept is based on four principles stressing the Internet should be Human rights-based, Open, Accessible, and based on [[Multistakeholder governance model|Multistakeholder]] participation. These have been abbreviated as the R-O-A-M principles. Understanding the Internet in this way helps to draw together different facets of [[Internet governance|Internet development]], concerned with technology and [[public policy]], rights and development.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/internetuniversality/about|title=Internet Universality|date=10 July 2017|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=30 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThrough the concept of internet universality, UNESCO highlights four separate but interdependent fields of Internet policy and practice that are considered \"key\" to assess a better Internet environment; access to information and knowledge, [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], [[privacy]], and [[Ethics|ethical norms]] and behavior online.\n\nA framework named ROAM was developed by UNESCO in order to investigate and evaluate the universality of Internet in different countries.

Innovation continues apace in many areas, from mobile applications and payment systems to social media and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The Internet has reached more people in more powerful ways than ever thought possible. It has also become a major resource for [[economic development]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Internet Universality Principles: R-O-A-M ==\nThe R-O-A-M principles are a [[Theory|theoretical]] framework for assessing the state of play of each key fields of Internet policy. The framework underscores a set of principles that, when applied to the Internet, aim to achieve an open, [[Global Internet usage|global]] and [[Internet security|secure]] [[Internet]], by highlighting the relevance of human rights as a whole, as well as openness, [[Internet access|accessibility]] and multistakeholder participation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rights-based ===\nThe Internet is becoming so significant in everyday life, work and identity in much of the world, that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish human rights on and off the Internet.<ref name=\":0\" /> UNESCO and the [[United Nations]] more broadly have affirmed the principle of human rights should apply to all aspects of the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/general-conference-37th/|title=General Conference 37th {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-27}}</ref> This would include, for example, freedom of expression, and privacy. UNESCO considers that as these two rights should also apply to the Internet, so should other rights, such as [[cultural diversity]], [[gender equality]], and [[education]]. As human rights are indivisible, for UNESCO all these rights mentioned above also need to be balanced with rights that apply to both [[Virtual life|digital]] and [[Life|extra-digital life]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Openness ===\nThis general principle, applied to the Internet, encompasses open [[Globalization|global]] standards, [[interoperability]], [[Interface (computing)|open application interfaces]], and open science, documents, text, data, and [[Flow network|flows]]. Social and political support for open systems, not only technical [[expertise]], is part of this principle. Transparency is part of openness, as well as a dimension of the rights to seek and receive information. Making rights and openness are [[Interdependence|interdependent]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nThere is special relevance to the Internet of the broader principle of social inclusion. This puts forward the role of accessibility in overcoming [[digital divide]]s, digital inequalities, and [[Social exclusion|exclusions]] based on skills, [[literacy]], language, [[gender]] or disability. It also points to the need for [[Sustainability|sustainable]] [[business model]]s for Internet activity, and to trust in the preservation, quality, integrity, security, and authenticity of information and knowledge. Accessibility is interlinked to rights and openness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Multistakeholders participation ===\n{{Main|Multi-stakeholder governance}}\n\nThe general principle of participation in [[decision-making]] that impacts on the lives of individuals has been part of the Internet from its outset, accounting for much of its success.<ref>{{Cite book|title=What if we all governed the Internet? Advancing multistakeholder participation in Internet governance|last=van der Spuy|first=Anri|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2017|isbn=|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002598/259867e.pdf|access-date=10 November 2017|pages=}}</ref> It recognizes the value of multistakeholder participation, incorporating [[user (computing)|user]]s and a user-centric perspective as well as all other actors critical to developing, using and [[Governance|governing]] the Internet across a range of levels. The other principles are enriched by the multistakeholder participation principle, because it states that everyone should have a stake in the future of the Internet.\n\nIt is possible to define a number of broad categories of stakeholders in the Internet, with subgroups as well: State, businesses and industries, [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental actors]], [[civil society]], [[Intergovernmental organization|international governmental organization]], research actors, individuals, and others. Each of these categories has more or less unique stakes in the future of the Internet, but there are also areas of great overlap and interdependence. For instance, some NGOs, are likely to prioritize the promotion of human rights; meanwhile parliaments are primary actors in defining laws to protect these rights. Still other stakeholders are key to shaping [[Human rights and encryption|rights online]], such as [[Search engine|search engine providers]], and [[Internet service provider|Internet Service Providers]] (ISPs).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002311/231162e.pdf|title=Fostering Freedom of Expression Online: The Role of Internet Intermediaries|last=MacKinnon|first=R.|last2=Hickok|first2=E.|last3=Bar|first3=A.|last4=Lim|first4=Hae-in|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|access-date=2 January 2015}}</ref> Individuals also have particular roles to play in respecting, promoting and protecting rights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cross-cutting factors ===\nAside from the four main factors (R-O-A-M), UNESCO has also identified five different cross-cutting factors that will suit all of the R-O-A-M factors, and should be taken into consideration. Of the five, two of them are concerned with gender and age equality, one is concerned with sustainable development (i.e. what part does the internet play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals developed by the UN), the fourth is concerned with internet trust and security, and the last is concerned with legal and ethical properties of the internet.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Internet Universality Indicators ==\nUNESCO is now developing Internet Universality indicators - based on the ROAM principles - to help governments and other stakeholders to assess their own national Internet environments and to promote the values associated with Internet Universality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/freedom-expression-internet|title=Freedom of Expression on the Internet|date=25 October 2017|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> The research process was envisioned to include [[wikt:consultation|consultation]]s at a range of global forums and a written [[questionnaire]] sent to key actors, but also a series of [[publication]]s on important [[Internet censorship|Internet Freedom]] related issues as encryption, [[Online hate speech|hate speech online]], privacy,  [[Internet safety|digital safety]] and [[Journalism and freedom|journalism]] sources.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/unesco-series-on-internet-freedom|title=UNESCO Series on Internet Freedom|date=1 November 2017|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> The outcome of this multidimensional research will be publicized in June 2018. The final indicators will be submitted to the UNESCO Member States in the International Program for Development of Communication (IPDC) for endorsement.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe indicators are divided into three different groups: quantitative indicators, qualitative indicators and institutional indicators (which concerns constitutional and legal arrangements). This has raised questions about the credibility of the indicators, as well as the difficulty of actually carrying out the research. Due to differences in data availability, it could be difficult to give a fair assessment to all indicators for all countries involved. However, in their draft UNESCO believes that the range and diversity of indicators included in the framework should enable the indicators to provide sufficient evidence of the Internet environment as a whole. Other challenges that it faces include different definitions of terms like 'broadband', as well as the fact that most of the data is held by private companies and is not publicly available as a result.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== The Four Major Fields of Focus ==\n\n=== Access to Information and Knowledge ===\n[[Access to information]] and knowledge encompasses the vision of universal access, not only to the Internet, but also to the ability to seek and receive open scientific, indigenous, and traditional knowledge [[Online and offline|online]], and also produce content in all forms. This requires initiatives for [[freedom of information]] and the building of [[Open access|open]] and preserved knowledge resources, as well as a respect for cultural and linguistic diversity that fosters local content in multiple languages, quality educational opportunities for all, including [[Media literacy|new media literacy]] and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on income, skills, education, gender, age, race, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], or accessibility by those with [[Disability|disabilities]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Frontiers in New Media Research|editor-last=Lee|editor-first=F.

Privacy refers broadly to Internet practices and policies that respect the rights of individuals to have a reasonable expectation of having a personal space, and to control access to their personal information. Privacy, therefore, allows individuals to freely express their ideas without fear of reprisals.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Privacy ===\n{{Main|Privacy}}\n\nPrivacy protection is however a tricky concept that goes together with the promotion of openness and transparency and a recognition that privacy and its protection underpins freedom of expression and trust in the Internet, and therefore its greater use for social and economic development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|Ethics}}\n\nEthics considers whether the norms, rules and procedures that govern online behavior and the design of the Internet and related [[digital media]] are based on ethical principles anchored in human rights based principles and geared to protecting the dignity and safety of individuals in cyberspace and advance accessibility, openness, and inclusiveness on the Internet. For example, Internet use should be sensitive to ethical considerations, such as non-discrimination on the basis of gender, age or disabilities; and shaped by ethics rather than used to retrospectively justify practices and policies, placing a focus on the intentionality of actions, as well as on the outcomes of Internet policies and practices.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Challenges to Internet Universality ==\n\nAs the [[World Wide Web]] and related digital media have evolved, they have come to serve many diverse purposes for many different actors, e.g. household entertainment, [[Surveillance|government surveillance]]. Technical innovations are altering traditional business models, such as in the provision of news, and the structure of organizations, where traditional hierarchical reporting relationships have been challenged by many-to-one and many-to-many networks of communication that span organizational boundaries.\n\n=== Policy ===\n{{See also|Human rights and encryption}}\n\nAs digital media have been a force behind the convergence of formerly more distinct technologies of the post, telephone, and [[mass media]], so policy and regulation have often failed to keep up, as we can see with the lack of a clear and unified regulation policy used by social media. This has left potentially inappropriate regulations in place and failed to integrate new solutions such as Media and information literacy. A worldwide ecology of policies and regulations is shaping the interrelated local and global outcomes of the Internet on access to information and knowledge, freedom of expression, privacy and ethics.\n<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001915/191594e.pdf|title=Freedom of Connection, Freedom of Expression: The Changing Legal and Regulatory Ecology Shaping the Internet|last=Dutton|first=W.

These measures restrict in a direct way citizens\u2019 rights to impart information and opinion, as well as impacting adversely on their rights to access online content. In many cases, users might not realize that content has been filtered or blocked. There was some recognition that alongside [[censorship]] as a violation of free expression, there is also legitimate reason in some contexts to block certain content, such as material that incites [[Online youth radicalization|violence]]. This raises the question of how to draw the line in specific cases about what to block, for how long, in what proportion, and with what transparency and redress mechanism.{{efn|This common example originated in 1919 with US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\u2019s opinion in the United States Supreme Court case Schenck v. United States.<ref>{{Cite court|litigants=Schenck v. United States|vol=249|reporter=U.S.|opinion=47|court=U.S.|date=3 March 1919|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/249/47.html}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother issue is the danger of holding intermediaries liable as if they were publishers \u2014 for example, making social media [[Computing platform|platform]]s responsible for an alleged case of hate speech. International standards of [[International human rights law|human rights law]] mean that removal, blockage or [[Filtering software|filtering]] of Internet content should be the exception to the norm of free flow of information, and that such actions fulfill the conditions of due purpose, necessity, proportionality, and transparency, and are authorized under relevant law and policy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Furthermore, multiple actors, including individual users can identify instances of censorship and expose these cases to the court of [[public opinion]]. In such ways, the Internet has the potential for enabling individual Internet users to hold institutions and other users more accountable for their actions online, creating what has been called a \u2018[[Fifth Estate]]\u2019, analogous to the [[Fourth Estate]] of the press, but potentially even more powerful.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dutton|first=W. H.|date=2009|title=The Fifth Estate Emerging through the Network of Networks|journal=Prometheus|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1\u201315}}</ref> A Fifth Estate does require a relatively free and open Internet to be sustainable and influential.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== User Targeting and Profiling ===\n[[Government]]s or commercial enterprises have the ability to target individual users, putting their privacy in danger, given that they will know much about their interests through their search or other online activities. Individual users of social media platforms can advertise to others who are interested in particular topics. This can appear more as a violation of privacy then the exercise of free speech. A related issue is the \u2018[[filter bubble]]\u2019:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web is Changing What We Read and How We Think|last=Pariser|first=E.|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2011|location=New York}}</ref> the idea that different Internet users will see different versions of the Internet, based on how algorithms use their previous search or social media preferences. User [[wikt:targeting|targeting]] can happen at the level of the government, [[private companies]], or even at the [[Infrastructure|infrastructural]] level.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Expression and Identification ===\nThe dependence of freedom of expression on related issues of privacy, anonymity, and encryption that face an apparent resistance to change.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Anonymity ===\nAnonymity can be a cornerstone of privacy; it is considered as a prerequisite for the expression of [[Popularity|unpopular]] or critical speech. A[[anonymity|nonymity]] is sometimes viewed as contributing to harmful speech, such as hate speech, which goes beyond international standards of human rights law for protected speech. Despite this perception, academic research has not established that removing anonymity and requiring the identification of speakers would be a cure to insensitive or hurtful remarks. These incivilities are often fostered by a larger set of circumstances, such as a failure of users sitting at a computer to fully realize that they are communicating with a real person. Anonymity may also impact on [[public debate]] online. In some countries, participants would refrain from participating (for instance on the issue of gay rights or domestic abuse) for fear of identification and [[persecution]]. Anonymity in [[Cyberattack|cyber-attacks]], including fake [[Domain (Internet)|domain]] attacks impersonating civil society, is a serious violation of free expression.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Data protection and surveillance ===\n[[Information privacy|Data protection]] can be critical to free expression. Increasing government surveillance of citizens, including through the collection and analysis of \u2018big data\u2019, is leading to an erosion of the citizens' rights to privacy and freedom of expression. A report of the former UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression states that, bulk access to all [[Data transmission|digital communications]] traffic eradicates the possibility of individualized proportionality analysis, because it pre-empts prior authorization based on specific targeted suspicion.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights|at=paras. 12, 13, 14|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> The role of [[mass surveillance]] potentials and the use of big data analytics could change the balance between the state and individuals. [[Whistleblower]], such as [[Edward Snowden]], helped identifying the mass surveillance of [[Metadata|communications metadata]], as a disproportionate response in relation to the security problem. Concern were also expressed during the \u2018CONNECTing the dots\u2019 conference about [[surveillance tools]], originally built to address severe crimes, being used to collect personal information about dissidents, or sometimes from all citizens. Further concerns were over weak transparency on how data is collected or used for security investigations. Manipulation of security practices such as the introduction of [[Software cracking|\u2018back doors]]\u2019 into [[software]], to allow legitimate government access can leave Internet users vulnerable to other, illegitimate threats. Attackers can potentially get in through the same back doors, rendering systems less secure.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Jurisdictional Issues ===\nThere are a certain number of obstacles in maintaining and promoting the rights to freedom of expression via regulation and regulatory frameworks. Due to its globalized and borderless nature, the Internet can be seen as inherently unregulated. There is, for example, a difficulty in establishing effective state-based regulation in a world where content can be hosted and accessed from entirely different countries, leading to regulation becoming obsolete. Striking the correct regulatory balance is difficult, as over- or inappropriate regulation can have negative consequences not only for freedom of expression but for the value of the Internet in general. UNESCO considers that governments role is not to restrict [[Political freedom|freedoms]], but rather to ensure that fundamental human rights \u2014 including communication-related rights \u2014 are protected. Paradoxically, a lack of regulation could be a detriment to the [[public interest]]. Internet-specific laws to protect freedom of expression could then be justified, since the Internet is so very different from any of the traditional media.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies\n| author = United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 107\n| source = http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/unesco-internet-study/\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232563&set=0059F32C26_3_360&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC BY SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Freedom of speech]]\n[[Category:Privacy]]\n[[Category:Internet governance]]\n", "text_old": "{{tone|date=July 2018}}\n'''Internet universality''' is a concept and framework adopted by [[UNESCO]] in 2015 to summarize their positions on the Internet.

Even those with access are often constrained by technical barriers, [[language barrier]]s, skills deficits and many other social and policy factors, from accessing information and knowledge in essential ways.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Working-Class Network Society: Communication Technology and the Information Have-Less in Urban China.|last=Qui|first=J.L.|publisher=Cambridge, MA: MIT Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The global diffusion of the Internet is progressing, but at the same time what we know as the Internet is continually changing. Innovation continues apace in many areas, from mobile applications and payment systems to social media and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The Internet has reached more people in more powerful ways than ever thought possible. It has also become a major resource for [[economic development]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Internet Universality Principles: R-O-A-M ==\nThe R-O-A-M principles are a [[Theory|theoretical]] framework for assessing the state of play of each key fields of Internet policy. The framework underscores a set of principles that, when applied to the Internet, aim to achieve an open, [[Global Internet usage|global]] and [[Internet security|secure]] [[Internet]], by highlighting the relevance of human rights as a whole, as well as openness, [[Internet access|accessibility]] and multistakeholder participation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rights-based ===\nThe Internet is becoming so significant in everyday life, work and identity in much of the world, that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish human rights on and off the Internet.<ref name=\":0\" /> UNESCO and the [[United Nations]] more broadly have affirmed the principle of human rights should apply to all aspects of the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/general-conference-37th/|title=General Conference 37th {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-27}}</ref> This would include, for example, freedom of expression, and privacy. UNESCO considers that as these two rights should also apply to the Internet, so should other rights, such as [[cultural diversity]], [[gender equality]], and [[education]]. As human rights are indivisible, for UNESCO all these rights mentioned above also need to be balanced with rights that apply to both [[Virtual life|digital]] and [[Life|extra-digital life]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Openness ===\nThis general principle, applied to the Internet, encompasses open [[Globalization|global]] standards, [[interoperability]], [[Interface (computing)|open application interfaces]], and open science, documents, text, data, and [[Flow network|flows]]. Social and political support for open systems, not only technical [[expertise]], is part of this principle. Transparency is part of openness, as well as a dimension of the rights to seek and receive information. Making rights and openness are [[Interdependence|interdependent]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nThere is special relevance to the Internet of the broader principle of social inclusion. This puts forward the role of accessibility in overcoming [[digital divide]]s, digital inequalities, and [[Social exclusion|exclusions]] based on skills, [[literacy]], language, [[gender]] or disability. It also points to the need for [[Sustainability|sustainable]] [[business model]]s for Internet activity, and to trust in the preservation, quality, integrity, security, and authenticity of information and knowledge. Accessibility is interlinked to rights and openness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Multistakeholders participation ===\n{{Main|Multi-stakeholder governance}}\n\nThe general principle of participation in [[decision-making]] that impacts on the lives of individuals has been part of the Internet from its outset, accounting for much of its success.<ref>{{Cite book|title=What if we all governed the Internet? Advancing multistakeholder participation in Internet governance|last=van der Spuy|first=Anri|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2017|isbn=|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002598/259867e.pdf|access-date=10 November 2017|pages=}}</ref> It recognizes the value of multistakeholder participation, incorporating [[user (computing)|user]]s and a user-centric perspective as well as all other actors critical to developing, using and [[Governance|governing]] the Internet across a range of levels. The other principles are enriched by the multistakeholder participation principle, because it states that everyone should have a stake in the future of the Internet.\n\nIt is possible to define a number of broad categories of stakeholders in the Internet, with subgroups as well: State, businesses and industries, [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental actors]], [[civil society]], [[Intergovernmental organization|international governmental organization]], research actors, individuals, and others. Each of these categories has more or less unique stakes in the future of the Internet, but there are also areas of great overlap and interdependence. For instance, some NGOs, are likely to prioritize the promotion of human rights; meanwhile parliaments are primary actors in defining laws to protect these rights. Still other stakeholders are key to shaping [[Human rights and encryption|rights online]], such as [[Search engine|search engine providers]], and [[Internet service provider|Internet Service Providers]] (ISPs).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002311/231162e.pdf|title=Fostering Freedom of Expression Online: The Role of Internet Intermediaries|last=MacKinnon|first=R.|last2=Hickok|first2=E.|last3=Bar|first3=A.|last4=Lim|first4=Hae-in|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|access-date=2 January 2015}}</ref> Individuals also have particular roles to play in respecting, promoting and protecting rights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cross-cutting factors ===\nAside from the four main factors (R-O-A-M), UNESCO has also identified five different cross-cutting factors that will suit all of the R-O-A-M factors, and should be taken into consideration. Of the five, two of them are concerned with gender and age equality, one is concerned with sustainable development (i.e. what part does the internet play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals developed by the UN), the fourth is concerned with internet trust and security, and the last is concerned with legal and ethical properties of the internet.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Internet Universality Indicators ==\nUNESCO is now developing Internet Universality indicators - based on the ROAM principles - to help governments and other stakeholders to assess their own national Internet environments and to promote the values associated with Internet Universality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/freedom-expression-internet|title=Freedom of Expression on the Internet|date=25 October 2017|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> The research process was envisioned to include [[wikt:consultation|consultation]]s at a range of global forums and a written [[questionnaire]] sent to key actors, but also a series of [[publication]]s on important [[Internet censorship|Internet Freedom]] related issues as encryption, [[Online hate speech|hate speech online]], privacy,  [[Internet safety|digital safety]] and [[Journalism and freedom|journalism]] sources.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/unesco-series-on-internet-freedom|title=UNESCO Series on Internet Freedom|date=1 November 2017|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> The outcome of this multidimensional research will be publicized in June 2018. The final indicators will be submitted to the UNESCO Member States in the International Program for Development of Communication (IPDC) for endorsement.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe indicators are divided into three different groups: quantitative indicators, qualitative indicators and institutional indicators (which concerns constitutional and legal arrangements). This has raised questions about the credibility of the indicators, as well as the difficulty of actually carrying out the research. Due to differences in data availability, it could be difficult to give a fair assessment to all indicators for all countries involved. However, in their draft UNESCO believes that the range and diversity of indicators included in the framework should enable the indicators to provide sufficient evidence of the Internet environment as a whole. Other challenges that it faces include different definitions of terms like 'broadband', as well as the fact that most of the data is held by private companies and is not publicly available as a result.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== The Four Major Fields of Focus ==\n\n=== Access to Information and Knowledge ===\n[[Access to information]] and knowledge encompasses the vision of universal access, not only to the Internet, but also to the ability to seek and receive open scientific, indigenous, and traditional knowledge [[Online and offline|online]], and also produce content in all forms. This requires initiatives for [[freedom of information]] and the building of [[Open access|open]] and preserved knowledge resources, as well as a respect for cultural and linguistic diversity that fosters local content in multiple languages, quality educational opportunities for all, including [[Media literacy|new media literacy]] and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on income, skills, education, gender, age, race, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], or accessibility by those with [[Disability|disabilities]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Frontiers in New Media Research|editor-last=Lee|editor-first=F.

Privacy refers broadly to Internet practices and policies that respect the rights of individuals to have a reasonable expectation of having a personal space, and to control access to their personal information. Privacy, therefore, allows individuals to freely express their ideas without fear of reprisals.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Privacy ===\n{{Main|Privacy}}\n\nPrivacy protection is however a tricky concept that goes together with the promotion of openness and transparency and a recognition that privacy and its protection underpins freedom of expression and trust in the Internet, and therefore its greater use for social and economic development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|Ethics}}\n\nEthics considers whether the norms, rules and procedures that govern online behavior and the design of the Internet and related [[digital media]] are based on ethical principles anchored in human rights based principles and geared to protecting the dignity and safety of individuals in cyberspace and advance accessibility, openness, and inclusiveness on the Internet. For example, Internet use should be sensitive to ethical considerations, such as non-discrimination on the basis of gender, age or disabilities; and shaped by ethics rather than used to retrospectively justify practices and policies, placing a focus on the intentionality of actions, as well as on the outcomes of Internet policies and practices.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Challenges to Internet Universality ==\n\nAs the [[World Wide Web]] and related digital media have evolved, they have come to serve many diverse purposes for many different actors, e.g. household entertainment, [[Surveillance|government surveillance]]. Technical innovations are altering traditional business models, such as in the provision of news, and the structure of organizations, where traditional hierarchical reporting relationships have been challenged by many-to-one and many-to-many networks of communication that span organizational boundaries.\n\n=== Policy ===\n{{See also|Human rights and encryption}}\n\nAs digital media have been a force behind the convergence of formerly more distinct technologies of the post, telephone, and [[mass media]], so policy and regulation have often failed to keep up, as we can see with the lack of a clear and unified regulation policy used by social media. This has left potentially inappropriate regulations in place and failed to integrate new solutions such as Media and information literacy. A worldwide ecology of policies and regulations is shaping the interrelated local and global outcomes of the Internet on access to information and knowledge, freedom of expression, privacy and ethics.\n<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001915/191594e.pdf|title=Freedom of Connection, Freedom of Expression: The Changing Legal and Regulatory Ecology Shaping the Internet|last=Dutton|first=W.

These measures restrict in a direct way citizens\u2019 rights to impart information and opinion, as well as impacting adversely on their rights to access online content. In many cases, users might not realize that content has been filtered or blocked. There was some recognition that alongside [[censorship]] as a violation of free expression, there is also legitimate reason in some contexts to block certain content, such as material that incites [[Online youth radicalization|violence]]. This raises the question of how to draw the line in specific cases about what to block, for how long, in what proportion, and with what transparency and redress mechanism.{{efn|This common example originated in 1919 with US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\u2019s opinion in the United States Supreme Court case Schenck v. United States.<ref>{{Cite court|litigants=Schenck v. United States|vol=249|reporter=U.S.|opinion=47|court=U.S.|date=3 March 1919|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/249/47.html}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother issue is the danger of holding intermediaries liable as if they were publishers \u2014 for example, making social media [[Computing platform|platform]]s responsible for an alleged case of hate speech. International standards of [[International human rights law|human rights law]] mean that removal, blockage or [[Filtering software|filtering]] of Internet content should be the exception to the norm of free flow of information, and that such actions fulfill the conditions of due purpose, necessity, proportionality, and transparency, and are authorized under relevant law and policy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Furthermore, multiple actors, including individual users can identify instances of censorship and expose these cases to the court of [[public opinion]]. In such ways, the Internet has the potential for enabling individual Internet users to hold institutions and other users more accountable for their actions online, creating what has been called a \u2018[[Fifth Estate]]\u2019, analogous to the [[Fourth Estate]] of the press, but potentially even more powerful.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dutton|first=W. H.|date=2009|title=The Fifth Estate Emerging through the Network of Networks|journal=Prometheus|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1\u201315}}</ref> A Fifth Estate does require a relatively free and open Internet to be sustainable and influential.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== User Targeting and Profiling ===\n[[Government]]s or commercial enterprises have the ability to target individual users, putting their privacy in danger, given that they will know much about their interests through their search or other online activities. Individual users of social media platforms can advertise to others who are interested in particular topics. This can appear more as a violation of privacy then the exercise of free speech. A related issue is the \u2018[[filter bubble]]\u2019:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web is Changing What We Read and How We Think|last=Pariser|first=E.|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2011|location=New York}}</ref> the idea that different Internet users will see different versions of the Internet, based on how algorithms use their previous search or social media preferences. User [[wikt:targeting|targeting]] can happen at the level of the government, [[private companies]], or even at the [[Infrastructure|infrastructural]] level.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Expression and Identification ===\nThe dependence of freedom of expression on related issues of privacy, anonymity, and encryption that face an apparent resistance to change.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Anonymity ===\nAnonymity can be a cornerstone of privacy; it is considered as a prerequisite for the expression of [[Popularity|unpopular]] or critical speech. A[[anonymity|nonymity]] is sometimes viewed as contributing to harmful speech, such as hate speech, which goes beyond international standards of human rights law for protected speech. Despite this perception, academic research has not established that removing anonymity and requiring the identification of speakers would be a cure to insensitive or hurtful remarks. These incivilities are often fostered by a larger set of circumstances, such as a failure of users sitting at a computer to fully realize that they are communicating with a real person. Anonymity may also impact on [[public debate]] online. In some countries, participants would refrain from participating (for instance on the issue of gay rights or domestic abuse) for fear of identification and [[persecution]]. Anonymity in [[Cyberattack|cyber-attacks]], including fake [[Domain (Internet)|domain]] attacks impersonating civil society, is a serious violation of free expression.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Data protection and surveillance ===\n[[Information privacy|Data protection]] can be critical to free expression. Increasing government surveillance of citizens, including through the collection and analysis of \u2018big data\u2019, is leading to an erosion of the citizens' rights to privacy and freedom of expression. A report of the former UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression states that, bulk access to all [[Data transmission|digital communications]] traffic eradicates the possibility of individualized proportionality analysis, because it pre-empts prior authorization based on specific targeted suspicion.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights|at=paras. 12, 13, 14|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> The role of [[mass surveillance]] potentials and the use of big data analytics could change the balance between the state and individuals. [[Whistleblower]], such as [[Edward Snowden]], helped identifying the mass surveillance of [[Metadata|communications metadata]], as a disproportionate response in relation to the security problem. Concern were also expressed during the \u2018CONNECTing the dots\u2019 conference about [[surveillance tools]], originally built to address severe crimes, being used to collect personal information about dissidents, or sometimes from all citizens. Further concerns were over weak transparency on how data is collected or used for security investigations. Manipulation of security practices such as the introduction of [[Software cracking|\u2018back doors]]\u2019 into [[software]], to allow legitimate government access can leave Internet users vulnerable to other, illegitimate threats. Attackers can potentially get in through the same back doors, rendering systems less secure.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Jurisdictional Issues ===\nThere are a certain number of obstacles in maintaining and promoting the rights to freedom of expression via regulation and regulatory frameworks. Due to its globalized and borderless nature, the Internet can be seen as inherently unregulated. There is, for example, a difficulty in establishing effective state-based regulation in a world where content can be hosted and accessed from entirely different countries, leading to regulation becoming obsolete. Striking the correct regulatory balance is difficult, as over- or inappropriate regulation can have negative consequences not only for freedom of expression but for the value of the Internet in general. UNESCO considers that governments role is not to restrict [[Political freedom|freedoms]], but rather to ensure that fundamental human rights \u2014 including communication-related rights \u2014 are protected. Paradoxically, a lack of regulation could be a detriment to the [[public interest]]. Internet-specific laws to protect freedom of expression could then be justified, since the Internet is so very different from any of the traditional media.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies\n| author = United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 107\n| source = http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/unesco-internet-study/\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232563&set=0059F32C26_3_360&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC BY SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Freedom of speech]]\n[[Category:Privacy]]\n[[Category:Internet governance]]\n", "name_user": "Relaxbear4649", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added links and fixed minor grammatical errors.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_universality"}
