Saliency detection is considered to be a key [[attention]]al mechanism that facilitates [[learning]] and survival by enabling organisms to focus their limited [[perception|perceptual]] and [[cognitive]] resources on the most pertinent subset of the available [[wikt:sensation|sensory]] [[data]].\n\nSaliency typically arises from contrasts between items and their neighborhood, such as a red dot surrounded by white dots, a flickering message indicator of an answering machine, or a loud noise in an otherwise quiet environment. Saliency detection is often studied in the context of the [[visual perception|visual]] system, but similar mechanisms operate in other sensory systems. What is salient can be influenced by training: for example, for human subjects particular letters can become salient by training.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.1.1 |title=Controlled and automatic human information processing: I.

This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (\u201cwanting\u201d) on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&nbsp;...<br />The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid24107968\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1731-13.2013 |pmid=24107968 |pmc=3792469 |title=Parceling Human Accumbens into Putative Core and Shell Dissociates Encoding of Values for Reward and Pain |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=33 |issue=41 |pages=16383\u201393 |year=2013 |last1=Baliki |first1=M.

Saliency detection is considered to be a key [[attention]]al mechanism that facilitates [[learning]] and survival by enabling organisms to focus their limited [[perception|perceptual]] and [[cognitive]] resources on the most pertinent subset of the available [[wikt:sensation|sensory]] [[data]].\n\nSaliency typically arises from contrasts between items and their neighborhood, such as a red dot surrounded by white dots, a flickering message indicator of an answering machine, or a loud noise in an otherwise quiet environment. Saliency detection is often studied in the context of the [[visual perception|visual]] system, but similar mechanisms operate in other sensory systems.

This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (\u201cwanting\u201d) on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&nbsp;...<br />The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid24107968\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1731-13.2013 |pmid=24107968 |pmc=3792469 |title=Parceling Human Accumbens into Putative Core and Shell Dissociates Encoding of Values for Reward and Pain |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=33 |issue=41 |pages=16383\u201393 |year=2013 |last1=Baliki |first1=M.

Edmond Leary and [[MC Shan]] produced the entire album, apart from one track which was produced by John Ficarrotta. The album was produced shortly before Snow was imprisoned for a year on an [[assault]] charge. Upon his release from [[prison]], his first single \"[[Informer (song)|Informer]]\" became a chart topping hit. It later went on to become one of the largest-selling reggae records of all time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter M.C. Shan discovered Snow through a Canadian DJ Prince Marvin, he began recording songs with Snow in New York in the Basement of his house at 169-05 Union Turnpike Queens NYC with his first Wife at the time Terri Moltke, currently Terri Tucker shopped his tape and live with Snow to several record labels offering a live demonstration of the tape to include Select Records and other Labels. The times were tough for the Moltke's as MC Shan did not receive marketing support from Warner Bros Cold Chillin' Records for his new album \"Play It Again Shan\". During the pregnancy of their second child, Terri Moltke-Tucker took Snow on the train all over Mahattan, N.Y.C. in the winter months of 1992 after, Michael Grier, Edmond Leary (AKIM), MC Shan, Terri Moltke all banged out what they thought was their best work ever. Terri Moltke stood in a coin laundry mat across from a Dunkin Donuts and next to a Seven 7 Eleven 11 store waiting for call backs from labels. Finally the pay phone wars with laundry patrons grew old day after day and Terri asked David Eng the Owner of Bayside Studios stating she could she use his reception service at the studio for call backs from labels for their Artist \"Snow\" whom she labeled as the next big ICON. David asked Terri if he could hear the Artist since he and Steve Salem his business partner just started a Record Label \"Mo Jam Records\" and she arranged a meeting with managers David Kenneth Eng and EZ Steve Salem (Same day signed a Management Deal) in their basement, and who also signed Snow to \"Mo Jam Records\".

is the debut album by Canadian [[reggae]] musician [[Snow (musician)|Snow]], released in 1993. Edmond Leary and [[MC Shan]] produced the entire album, apart from one track which was produced by John Ficarrotta. The album was produced shortly before Snow was imprisoned for a year on an [[assault]] charge. Upon his release from [[prison]], his first single \"[[Informer (song)|Informer]]\" became a chart topping hit. It later went on to become one of the largest-selling reggae records of all time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter M.C. Shan discovered Snow through a Canadian DJ Prince Marvin, he began recording songs with Snow in New York in the Basement of his house at 169-05 Union Turnpike Queens NYC with his first Wife at the time Terri Moltke, currently Terri Tucker shopped his tape and live with Snow to several record labels offering a live demonstration of the tape to include Select Records and other Labels. The times were tough for the Moltke's as MC Shan did not receive marketing support from Warner Bros Cold Chillin' Records for his new album \"Play It Again Shan\". During the pregnancy of their second child, Terri Moltke-Tucker took Snow on the train all over Mahattan, N.Y.C. in the winter months of 1992 after, Michael Grier, Edmond Leary (AKIM), MC Shan, Terri Moltke all banged out what they thought was their best work ever. Terri Moltke stood in a coin laundry mat across from a Dunkin Donuts and next to a Seven 7 Eleven 11 store waiting for call backs from labels. Finally the pay phone wars with laundry patrons grew old day after day and Terri asked David Eng the Owner of Bayside Studios stating she could she use his reception service at the studio for call backs from labels for their Artist \"Snow\" whom she labeled as the next big ICON. David asked Terri if he could hear the Artist since he and Steve Salem his business partner just started a Record Label \"Mo Jam Records\" and she arranged a meeting with managers David Kenneth Eng and EZ Steve Salem (Same day signed a Management Deal) in their basement, and who also signed Snow to \"Mo Jam Records\". While awaiting trial for assault with a crowbar fight outside of a Canadian Pub and murder charges eight (8) Months later Snow was acquitted, Shan and Snow began mixing the completed album down at the Bayside Studios. The inspiration for the song [[Informer (song)|Informer]] stemmed from a late night incident across the street from Snow's Allenbury home.

In his service as a [[A&R|talent scout]], Hammond became one of the most influential figures in 20th-century popular music. He is the father of famous blues musician [[John P. Hammond]].\n\nHammond was instrumental in sparking or furthering numerous musical careers, including those of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Harry James]], [[Charlie Christian]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Babatunde Olatunji]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[George Benson]], [[Freddie Green]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Arthur Russell (musician)|Arthur Russell]], [[Jim Copp]], [[Asha Puthli]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Mike Bloomfield]]. He is also largely responsible for the revival of [[delta blues]] artist [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s music.\n\n==Early years and family==\nHammond was born in [[New York City|New York]], christened John Henry Hammond Jr., although both his father and grandfather shared the same name. He was the youngest child and only son of John Henry Hammond and [[Emily Vanderbilt Sloane]]. His mother was one of three daughters of William Douglas Sloane and [[Emily Thorn Vanderbilt]], and a granddaughter of [[William Henry Vanderbilt]].\n\nHis father attended [[Yale University]], graduating with a law degree from [[Columbia Law School]]. His grandfather was Civil War General John Henry Hammond, who married Sophia Vernon Wolfe. His father was a brother of [[Ogden H. Hammond]], ambassador to [[Spain]], and uncle to politician [[Millicent Fenwick]]. Despite the family fortune from his mother's side of the family, which included wealth from the [[W. & J. Sloane]] chain, his father worked to provide for his family and maintain the family fortune. He worked \"as a banker, lawyer, and railroad executive\".<ref name=Prial>Dunstan Prial (2006) ''The Producer: John Hammond and the Soul of American Music'', Farrar, Straus and Giroux, {{ISBN|0-374-11304-1}}</ref>\n\nHammond had four sisters: Emily, Adele, Rachel, and Alice. The youngest, Alice married first, [[Arthur Duckworth]] in 1927, which ended in divorce and second, musician [[Benny Goodman]] in 1942.\n\nHammond showed interest in music from an early age. At four he began studying the piano, only to switch to the violin at age eight. He was steered toward classical music by his mother, but was more interested in the music sung and played by the servants, many of whom were black. He was known to go down to his basement to listen to the upbeat music in the servants' quarters. He loved [[Sir Harry Lauder]]'s \"[[Roamin' in the Gloamin']]\". While he was in the basement, the rest of his family in the greater part of the five-story mansion would listen to \"the great opera tenor [[Enrico Caruso]], as well as to standard classics by [[Beethoven]], [[Brahms]], and [[Mozart]]\".<ref name=Prial />\n\nHammond became interested in social reform at a young age. His mother also promoted social reform as a means to give back some of her fortune to the community. She often found solace in religion. Hammond shared her desire to help the community with his privilege.<ref name=Prial />\n\nHammond notes that the first jazz music that he heard was in London in 1923 on a trip with his family. He heard a band called [[The Georgians (Frank Guarente)|The Georgians]], a white Dixieland jazz group, and saw a Negro show called ''From Dixie to Broadway'', that featured [[Sidney Bechet]]. This trip changed the way that he thought about music. Upon his return to the states, Hammond searched for records by Negro musicians but could not find them in the greater [[Manhattan]] area. He learned that Negro music was sold in different stores, so he began to search for this music in [[Harlem]].<ref name=JazzHist>John Hammond, \"An Experience in Jazz History\", in Dominique-Ren\u00e9 de Lerma, ed., ''Black Music in Our Culture: Curricular Ideas on the Subjects, Materials, and Problems'' (Kent State University Press, 1970), pp. 42\u201353.</ref>\n\nIn 1925 Hammond graduated from the elementary institution [[St. Bernard's School]] at the age of 14. He persuaded his family to allow him to attend [[Hotchkiss School]] due to its liberal curriculum. Hammond's love for music flourished. However, he felt limited within the confines of a boarding school. Hammond succeeded in convincing the headmaster to allow him to go into the city every other weekend, a rare privilege, so that he could take lessons from Ronald Murat. However, the headmaster was not aware that outside his formal lessons, Hammond would go up to Harlem to hear jazz. During this time, he said that he heard [[Bessie Smith]] perform at [[The Harlem Alhambra]], but her biographer disagrees about the dates.<ref name=Prial />\n\nThe summer after graduating from Hotchkiss in 1929, Hammond went to work for a newspaper in Maine, the ''Portland Evening News''. Its editor [[Ernest Gruening]] was also a Hotchkiss alumnus, class of 1903, who was interested in social issues and social justice.<ref name=Prial /><ref name=\"HOTCHKISSNEWS\">[https://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/closerlook.aspx?id=8 \"Alumni Accomplishments: Ernest Gruening '03\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111112714/http://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/closerlook.aspx?id=8 |date=November 11, 2012 }}, The Hotchkiss School</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1929, Hammond entered [[Yale University]] as a member of the class of 1933. He studied the violin and, later, [[viola]]. He felt a disconnect with his fellow students at Yale and felt that he was already well acquainted with the professional world. He made frequent trips into New York city and wrote regularly for trade magazines. In the fall semester of 1930, Hammond had to withdraw due to a recurring case of [[jaundice]]. Hammond had no desire to a repeat a semester, which contributed to his dissatisfaction with the university lifestyle. Much to the disappointment of his father, a Yale alumnus, in 1931 he dropped out of school for a career in the music industry, first becoming the U.S. correspondent for ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref name=Prial />\n\n==Career==\nIn 1931, Hammond funded the recording of pianist [[Garland Wilson]], marking the beginning of a long string of artistic successes as record producer. He moved to [[Greenwich Village]], where he claimed to have engaged in bohemian life and worked for an integrated music world. He set up one of the first regular live [[jazz]] programs, and wrote regularly about the racial divide. As he wrote in his memoirs,<ref>''John Hammond On Record: An Autobiography'', {{ISBN|0-671-40003-7}}</ref> \"I heard no color line in the music.... To bring recognition to the negro's supremacy in jazz was the most effective and constructive form of social protest I could think of.\" This pre-occupation with social issues was to continue, and in 1941 he was one of the founders of the [[Council on African Affairs]].\n\nIn 1932, Hammond acquired a nonpaying job on the [[WEVD]] radio station as a disc jockey. He did not discriminate when choosing which musicians to air; the station allowed Hammond complete freedom on the station as long as he paid for his time slot. Through this position, Hammond gained a reputation as a well-educated jazz fan. Various musicians were guests on his show, including [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], and [[Art Tatum]]. When the station transferred from the [[Broadway Central Hotel]] to the [[Hotel Claridge|Claridge Hotel]], the new venue would not allow the black musicians to use the main elevator. For this reason, Hammond quit his work with WEVD.<ref name=Prial />\n\nBy 1932\u201333, through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond arranged for the faltering US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough during the [[Great Depression]] that many of them would not have otherwise had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US).\n\nIn 1934, Hammond is known to have introduced [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Fletcher Henderson]]. It is said that Hammond convinced the musicians to 'swing' the current jazz hits, so that they could play in a free manner like the original New Orleans Jazz.<ref>\"Swing\". ''The Subject Is Jazz''. WNBC. New York, New York, 1958. Television.</ref>\n\nHammond always strived for racial integration within the musical scene. For this purpose, he frequently visited musicians in Harlem in order to connect with musicians in their own area. While initially his race proved a problem in connecting with this community, he formed relationships with various musicians that allowed him to surpass this barrier. His friendship with [[Benny Carter]] gave him a status that allowed him to enter this musical community.<ref name=Prial />\n\nHe played a role in organizing Benny Goodman's band, and in persuading him to hire black musicians such as [[Charlie Christian]], [[Teddy Wilson]] and [[Lionel Hampton]]. In 1933 he heard the seventeen-year-old [[Billie Holiday]] perform in Harlem and arranged for her recording debut, on a Benny Goodman session. Four years later, he heard the [[Count Basie]] orchestra broadcasting from Kansas City and brought it to New York, where it began to receive national attention.<ref name=\"Centennial\">{{cite web\n| publisher=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/15/132079058/john-hammond-the-ear-of-an-oracle|accessdate=December 16, 2010|date=December 15, 2010|author=John McDonough|title=John Hammond: The Ear Of An Oracle}}</ref>\n \nIn 1938, Hammond organized the first ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'' concert at Carnegie Hall, presenting a broad program of [[blues]], [[jazz]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] artists, including [[Ida Cox]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Albert Ammons]], [[Pete Johnson]], [[Meade Lux Lewis|Meade \"Lux\" Lewis]], [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], the [[Count Basie]] orchestra, [[Sidney Bechet]], [[Sonny Terry]], [[James P.

Web.</ref>\n\nAfter serving in the military during World War II, Hammond felt unmoved by the [[bebop]] jazz scene of the mid-1940s. Rejoining [[Columbia Records]] in the late 1950s, he signed [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Babatunde Olatunji]] to the label, and discovered [[Aretha Franklin]],<ref name=pc52>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

In 1983, he brought guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] to Columbia and was credited as executive producer on his debut album.\n\n==Personal accounts==\nHammond recognized jazz music to have originated as an African-American musical genre. When Hammond entered the jazz community, integration had not yet begun. Black and white musicians rarely played together and often the prestigious locations permitted only white audiences. Hammond remembers that before the 1920s, black musicians could always find jobs, even if they were low paying. After the instatement of Local 802, a union of professional musicians within New York City, Hammond saw more white people receiving jobs than black people. However, this did not stop the African-American musicians. Through burlesque and record making, these musicians continued to be a presence.<ref name=JazzHist />\n\n1933 was a defining year for Hammond. He remembers this year being extraordinary due to his establishment of relationships with British record companies. Hammond was able to secure contracts for various musicians. He was an attractive producer to these companies because he did not desire a profit for himself. In 1933, he helped [[Benny Goodman]] receive a record deal with [[Columbia Records]], which at the time was only known as English Columbia. During this time, Goodman was in need of a big break, as he was getting a reputation as being difficult to work with. Hammond proposed that Goodman produce a multiracial record; however, Goodman believed this route would hurt his musical reputation.<ref name=Prial />\n\nIn this year, Hammond broke out of the traditional role of a producer and became a talent scout, after hearing [[Billie Holiday]]. He remarks that he was astounded to discover that she was the daughter of [[Clarence Holiday]] from [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band. That same year, he was able to get her involved in the [[Benny Goodman Orchestra]].<ref name=JazzHist /> Hammond attributes fate to his finding of Holiday. After hearing her sing for the first time, he wrote, \"She weighs over 200 pounds, is incredibly beautiful, and sings as well as anybody I have ever heard.\"<ref name=Prial />\n\nLater in 1933, he heard [[Teddy Wilson]], a jazz pianist, on the Chicago radio. While he did not discover him, he was able to provide significant opportunities for him, even some collaboration with Billie Holiday.<ref name=JazzHist />\n\nHammond's work with civil rights came from multiple angles. In 1933, he traveled South to attend a trial regarding the [[Scottsboro case]], a case in which two white girls accused nine black boys of raping them. The testimonies of the two girls did not align with the story. While all nine boys were convicted, Hammond viewed this trial as a \"catalyst for black activism\".<ref name=Prial />\n\nRecord integration became an important component of jazz music. Starting in 1935, musicians began to record in mixed-race groups. While some of this integration had already taken place, Hammond remembers it as being hidden. However, in 1935, the Goodman Trio began recording. In 1936, the group appeared in a live concert at the Chicago Hot Jazz Society. Hammond fondly remembers this as an innovative moment in jazz history.<ref name=JazzHist />\n\n==FBI investigation==\n[[J. Edgar Hoover]], FBI director, investigated Hammond's link to the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]. Due to the various benefits and fund-raisers that Hammond hosted for the popular front, his name was often listed in ''[[The Daily Worker]]'', a communist newspaper. Furthermore, his name often appeared on the letterheads of left-wing organizations for which he was a donor or member. However, Hammond was not a communist.<ref name=Prial />\n\n==Personal life==\nJohn had four sisters: Alice, Rachel, Adele, and Emily.\n\nEarly in his career, Hammond focused more on his work than his love life. While he was seen publicly with various women, the relationships were never substantial. However, in 1940 at a Manhattan party, Hammond met Jemison \"Jemy\" McBride. On March 8, 1941, Hammond married Jemy in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The couple had a small, non-denominational wedding with only about ten guests. Although both sets of parents approved of the couple, neither set attended the wedding.<ref name=Prial />\n\nIn 1942, Hammond took his wife on a road trip to Los Angeles. Shortly after this trip, Jemy realized that she was pregnant. In November 1942, Jemy gave birth to their first son, [[John P. Hammond]].<ref name=Prial />\n\nOn March 21, 1942, Hammond's sister, Alice married [[Benny Goodman]]. She had previously been married to Englishman George Duckworth, a member of the British House of Commons. Hammond did not look kindly upon her marriage to Goodman. After years of arguments and disagreements about musical issues for Goodman's band, Hammond and Goodman had a complete falling out, some of which has been attributed to their differing class and educational backgrounds (Goodman had been born into poverty and had quit high school in order to help support his family as a musician). However, out of a sense of shared grief following Alice's death in 1978, John and Benny reconciled their friendship.<ref name=Prial />\n\nIn November 1943, after the United States entered World War II, Hammond began military training. He underwent his basic training at [[Fort Belvoir]]. Hammond was much older than the majority of the other men, and he had a rough time adjusting to the military life. While he was still in basic training, Jemy gave birth to their second child, Douglas, early in 1944. Douglas came down with a serious illness. While Jemy sent Hammond a telegram to alert him of his newborn's condition, Hammond said that he never received it. Jemy speculated that Hammond was in a concert and disregarded the letter; however, that claim has been proven unlikely due to Hammond's strict schedule in basic training. Douglas died shortly after birth from his illness, and Jemy had to undergo the family tragedy without her husband. Hammond returned after basic training on a three-day pass, but he and his wife were distant.<ref name=Prial />\n\nAfter basic training, Hammond reported to Camp Plauche, where he was placed to organize activities for the black soldiers. During this time period, African-American soldiers were given little to do within the military. The  armed forces were still segregated and discriminatory. Hammond began his efforts by organizing concerts for the soldiers featuring African-American musicians. He noted that shortly after these concerts began, an integrated sports team formed. Toward the end of [[World War II]], Hammond was transferred to [[Fort Benning]], Georgia, known for its intense racism. Hammond was not the only jazz fan irritated with racism. During this time period, [[bebop]] music grew out of late night jam sessions of black musicians. Hammond was not much a part of the bebop movement, but he shared the sentiment against racism.<ref name=Prial />\n\nIn 1946, Hammond was discharged from the military. His family moved to [[Greenwich Village]], where Jemy gave birth to their third son, Jason. Hammond threw himself back into his work, which greatly upset his wife. In 1948, Jemy asked Hammond for a divorce. While he was originally reluctant, Hammond agreed to the divorce. Jemy never remarried.<ref name=Prial />\n\nA year later, in 1949, Hammond met Esme Sarnoff, originally Esme O'Brien, the former wife of [[NBC]] chairman Robert W. Sarnoff, and a daughter of Mary and Esmond O'Brien. Esme shared Hammond's musical passion and was planning to divorce her husband. That year, Hammond married Esme Sarnoff. By this marriage Hammond had one stepdaughter, (Esme) Rosita Sarnoff (born 1943). During this time, Hammond's father died on a golf course. Left a widow, Emily Hammond became infatuated with [[Frank Buchman]].<ref name=Prial />\n\nIn 1985, Hammond had his first stroke. Although this impaired him physically, his wife's death left him in despair. Esme Hammond was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]].

In his service as a [[A&R|talent scout]], Hammond became one of the most influential figures in 20th-century popular music. He is the father of famous blues musician [[John P. Hammond]].\n\nHammond was instrumental in sparking or furthering numerous musical careers, including those of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Harry James]], [[Charlie Christian]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Babatunde Olatunji]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[George Benson]], [[Freddie Green]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Arthur Russell (musician)|Arthur Russell]], [[Jim Copp]], [[Asha Puthli]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Mike Bloomfield]]. He is also largely responsible for the revival of [[delta blues]] artist [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s music.\n\n==Early years and family==\nHammond was born in [[New York City|New York]], christened John Henry Hammond Jr., although both his father and grandfather shared the same name. He was the youngest child and only son of John Henry Hammond and [[Emily Vanderbilt Sloane]]. His mother was one of three daughters of William Douglas Sloane and [[Emily Thorn Vanderbilt]], and a granddaughter of [[William Henry Vanderbilt]].\n\nHis father attended [[Yale University]], graduating with a law degree from [[Columbia Law School]]. His grandfather was Civil War General John Henry Hammond, who married Sophia Vernon Wolfe. His father was a brother of [[Ogden H. Hammond]], ambassador to [[Spain]], and uncle to politician [[Millicent Fenwick]]. Despite the family fortune from his mother's side of the family, which included wealth from the [[W. & J. Sloane]] chain, his father worked to provide for his family and maintain the family fortune. He worked \"as a banker, lawyer, and railroad executive\".<ref name=Prial>Dunstan Prial (2006) ''The Producer: John Hammond and the Soul of American Music'', Farrar, Straus and Giroux, {{ISBN|0-374-11304-1}}</ref>\n\nHammond had four sisters: Emily, Adele, Rachel, and Alice. The youngest, Alice married first, [[Arthur Duckworth]] in 1927, which ended in divorce and second, musician [[Benny Goodman]] in 1942.\n\nHammond showed interest in music from an early age. At four he began studying the piano, only to switch to the violin at age eight. He was steered toward classical music by his mother, but was more interested in the music sung and played by the servants, many of whom were black. He was known to go down to his basement to listen to the upbeat music in the servants' quarters. He loved [[Sir Harry Lauder]]'s \"[[Roamin' in the Gloamin']]\". While he was in the basement, the rest of his family in the greater part of the five-story mansion would listen to \"the great opera tenor [[Enrico Caruso]], as well as to standard classics by [[Beethoven]], [[Brahms]], and [[Mozart]]\".<ref name=Prial />\n\nHammond became interested in social reform at a young age. His mother also promoted social reform as a means to give back some of her fortune to the community. She often found solace in religion. Hammond shared her desire to help the community with his privilege.<ref name=Prial />\n\nHammond notes that the first jazz music that he heard was in London in 1923 on a trip with his family. He heard a band called [[The Georgians (Frank Guarente)|The Georgians]], a white Dixieland jazz group, and saw a Negro show called ''From Dixie to Broadway'', that featured [[Sidney Bechet]]. This trip changed the way that he thought about music. Upon his return to the states, Hammond searched for records by Negro musicians but could not find them in the greater [[Manhattan]] area. He learned that Negro music was sold in different stores, so he began to search for this music in [[Harlem]].<ref name=JazzHist>John Hammond, \"An Experience in Jazz History\", in Dominique-Ren\u00e9 de Lerma, ed., ''Black Music in Our Culture: Curricular Ideas on the Subjects, Materials, and Problems'' (Kent State University Press, 1970), pp. 42\u201353.</ref>\n\nIn 1925 Hammond graduated from the elementary institution [[St. Bernard's School]] at the age of 14. He persuaded his family to allow him to attend [[Hotchkiss School]] due to its liberal curriculum. Hammond's love for music flourished. However, he felt limited within the confines of a boarding school. Hammond succeeded in convincing the headmaster to allow him to go into the city every other weekend, a rare privilege, so that he could take lessons from Ronald Murat. However, the headmaster was not aware that outside his formal lessons, Hammond would go up to Harlem to hear jazz. During this time, he said that he heard [[Bessie Smith]] perform at [[The Harlem Alhambra]], but her biographer disagrees about the dates.<ref name=Prial />\n\nThe summer after graduating from Hotchkiss in 1929, Hammond went to work for a newspaper in Maine, the ''Portland Evening News''. Its editor [[Ernest Gruening]] was also a Hotchkiss alumnus, class of 1903, who was interested in social issues and social justice.<ref name=Prial /><ref name=\"HOTCHKISSNEWS\">[https://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/closerlook.aspx?id=8 \"Alumni Accomplishments: Ernest Gruening '03\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111112714/http://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/closerlook.aspx?id=8 |date=November 11, 2012 }}, The Hotchkiss School</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1929, Hammond entered [[Yale University]] as a member of the class of 1933. He studied the violin and, later, [[viola]]. He felt a disconnect with his fellow students at Yale and felt that he was already well acquainted with the professional world. He made frequent trips into New York city and wrote regularly for trade magazines. In the fall semester of 1930, Hammond had to withdraw due to a recurring case of [[jaundice]]. Hammond had no desire to a repeat a semester, which contributed to his dissatisfaction with the university lifestyle. Much to the disappointment of his father, a Yale alumnus, in 1931 he dropped out of school for a career in the music industry, first becoming the U.S. correspondent for ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref name=Prial />\n\n==Career==\nIn 1931, Hammond funded the recording of pianist [[Garland Wilson]], marking the beginning of a long string of artistic successes as record producer. He moved to [[Greenwich Village]], where he claimed to have engaged in bohemian life and worked for an integrated music world. He set up one of the first regular live [[jazz]] programs, and wrote regularly about the racial divide. As he wrote in his memoirs,<ref>''John Hammond On Record: An Autobiography'', {{ISBN|0-671-40003-7}}</ref> \"I heard no color line in the music.... To bring recognition to the negro's supremacy in jazz was the most effective and constructive form of social protest I could think of.\" This pre-occupation with social issues was to continue, and in 1941 he was one of the founders of the [[Council on African Affairs]].\n\nIn 1932, Hammond acquired a nonpaying job on the [[WEVD]] radio station as a disc jockey. He did not discriminate when choosing which musicians to air; the station allowed Hammond complete freedom on the station as long as he paid for his time slot. Through this position, Hammond gained a reputation as a well-educated jazz fan. Various musicians were guests on his show, including [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], and [[Art Tatum]]. When the station transferred from the [[Broadway Central Hotel]] to the [[Hotel Claridge|Claridge Hotel]], the new venue would not allow the black musicians to use the main elevator. For this reason, Hammond quit his work with WEVD.<ref name=Prial />\n\nBy 1932\u201333, through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond arranged for the faltering US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough during the [[Great Depression]] that many of them would not have otherwise had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US).\n\nIn 1934, Hammond is known to have introduced [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Fletcher Henderson]]. It is said that Hammond convinced the musicians to 'swing' the current jazz hits, so that they could play in a free manner like the original New Orleans Jazz.<ref>\"Swing\". ''The Subject Is Jazz''. WNBC. New York, New York, 1958. Television.</ref>\n\nHammond always strived for racial integration within the musical scene. For this purpose, he frequently visited musicians in Harlem in order to connect with musicians in their own area. While initially his race proved a problem in connecting with this community, he formed relationships with various musicians that allowed him to surpass this barrier. His friendship with [[Benny Carter]] gave him a status that allowed him to enter this musical community.<ref name=Prial />\n\nHe played a role in organizing Benny Goodman's band, and in persuading him to hire black musicians such as [[Charlie Christian]], [[Teddy Wilson]] and [[Lionel Hampton]]. In 1933 he heard the seventeen-year-old [[Billie Holiday]] perform in Harlem and arranged for her recording debut, on a Benny Goodman session. Four years later, he heard the [[Count Basie]] orchestra broadcasting from Kansas City and brought it to New York, where it began to receive national attention.<ref name=\"Centennial\">{{cite web\n| publisher=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/15/132079058/john-hammond-the-ear-of-an-oracle|accessdate=December 16, 2010|date=December 15, 2010|author=John McDonough|title=John Hammond: The Ear Of An Oracle}}</ref>\n \nIn 1938, Hammond organized the first ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'' concert at Carnegie Hall, presenting a broad program of [[blues]], [[jazz]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] artists, including [[Ida Cox]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Albert Ammons]], [[Pete Johnson]], [[Meade Lux Lewis|Meade \"Lux\" Lewis]], [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], the [[Count Basie]] orchestra, [[Sidney Bechet]], [[Sonny Terry]], [[James P.

Web.</ref>\n\nAfter serving in the military during World War II, Hammond felt unmoved by the [[bebop]] jazz scene of the mid-1940s. Rejoining [[Columbia Records]] in the late 1950s, he signed [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Babatunde Olatunji]] to the label, and discovered [[Aretha Franklin]],<ref name=pc52>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

In 1983, he brought guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] to Columbia and was credited as executive producer on his debut album.\n\n==Personal accounts==\nHammond recognized jazz music to have originated as an African-American musical genre. When Hammond entered the jazz community, integration had not yet begun. Black and white musicians rarely played together and often the prestigious locations permitted only white audiences. Hammond remembers that before the 1920s, black musicians could always find jobs, even if they were low paying. After the instatement of Local 802, a union of professional musicians within New York City, Hammond saw more white people receiving jobs than black people. However, this did not stop the African-American musicians. Through burlesque and record making, these musicians continued to be a presence.<ref name=JazzHist />\n\n1933 was a defining year for Hammond. He remembers this year being extraordinary due to his establishment of relationships with British record companies. Hammond was able to secure contracts for various musicians. He was an attractive producer to these companies because he did not desire a profit for himself. In 1933, he helped [[Benny Goodman]] receive a record deal with [[Columbia Records]], which at the time was only known as English Columbia. During this time, Goodman was in need of a big break, as he was getting a reputation as being difficult to work with. Hammond proposed that Goodman produce a multiracial record; however, Goodman believed this route would hurt his musical reputation.<ref name=Prial />\n\nIn this year, Hammond broke out of the traditional role of a producer and became a talent scout, after hearing [[Billie Holiday]]. He remarks that he was astounded to discover that she was the daughter of [[Clarence Holiday]] from [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band. That same year, he was able to get her involved in the [[Benny Goodman Orchestra]].<ref name=JazzHist /> Hammond attributes fate to his finding of Holiday. After hearing her sing for the first time, he wrote, \"She weighs over 200 pounds, is incredibly beautiful, and sings as well as anybody I have ever heard.\"<ref name=Prial />\n\nLater in 1933, he heard [[Teddy Wilson]], a jazz pianist, on the Chicago radio. While he did not discover him, he was able to provide significant opportunities for him, even some collaboration with Billie Holiday.<ref name=JazzHist />\n\nHammond's work with civil rights came from multiple angles. In 1933, he traveled South to attend a trial regarding the [[Scottsboro case]], a case in which two white girls accused nine black boys of raping them. The testimonies of the two girls did not align with the story. While all nine boys were convicted, Hammond viewed this trial as a \"catalyst for black activism\".<ref name=Prial />\n\nRecord integration became an important component of jazz music. Starting in 1935, musicians began to record in mixed-race groups. While some of this integration had already taken place, Hammond remembers it as being hidden. However, in 1935, the Goodman Trio began recording. In 1936, the group appeared in a live concert at the Chicago Hot Jazz Society. Hammond fondly remembers this as an innovative moment in jazz history.<ref name=JazzHist />\n\n==FBI investigation==\n[[J. Edgar Hoover]], FBI director, investigated Hammond's link to the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]. Due to the various benefits and fund-raisers that Hammond hosted for the popular front, his name was often listed in ''[[The Daily Worker]]'', a communist newspaper. Furthermore, his name often appeared on the letterheads of left-wing organizations for which he was a donor or member. However, Hammond was not a communist.<ref name=Prial />\n\n==Personal life==\nJohn had four sisters: Alice, Rachel, Adele, and Emily.\n\nEarly in his career, Hammond focused more on his work than his love life. While he was seen publicly with various women, the relationships were never substantial. However, in 1940 at a Manhattan party, Hammond met Jemison \"Jemy\" McBride. On March 8, 1941, Hammond married Jemy in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The couple had a small, non-denominational wedding with only about ten guests. Although both sets of parents approved of the couple, neither set attended the wedding.<ref name=Prial />\n\nIn 1942, Hammond took his wife on a road trip to Los Angeles. Shortly after this trip, Jemy realized that she was pregnant. In November 1942, Jemy gave birth to their first son, [[John P. Hammond]].<ref name=Prial />\n\nOn March 21, 1942, Hammond's sister, Alice married [[Benny Goodman]]. She had previously been married to Englishman George Duckworth, a member of the British House of Commons. Hammond did not look kindly upon her marriage to Goodman. After years of arguments and disagreements about musical issues for Goodman's band, Hammond and Goodman had a complete falling out, some of which has been attributed to their differing class and educational backgrounds (Goodman had been born into poverty and had quit high school in order to help support his family as a musician). However, out of a sense of shared grief following Alice's death in 1978, John and Benny reconciled their friendship.<ref name=Prial />\n\nIn November 1943, after the United States entered World War II, Hammond began military training. He underwent his basic training at [[Fort Belvoir]]. Hammond was much older than the majority of the other men, and he had a rough time adjusting to the military life. While he was still in basic training, Jemy gave birth to their second child, Douglas, early in 1944. Douglas came down with a serious illness. While Jemy sent Hammond a telegram to alert him of his newborn's condition, Hammond said that he never received it. Jemy speculated that Hammond was in a concert and disregarded the letter; however, that claim has been proven unlikely due to Hammond's strict schedule in basic training. Douglas died shortly after birth from his illness, and Jemy had to undergo the family tragedy without her husband. Hammond returned after basic training on a three-day pass, but he and his wife were distant.<ref name=Prial />\n\nAfter basic training, Hammond reported to Camp Plauche, where he was placed to organize activities for the black soldiers. During this time period, African-American soldiers were given little to do within the military. The  armed forces were still segregated and discriminatory. Hammond began his efforts by organizing concerts for the soldiers featuring African-American musicians. He noted that shortly after these concerts began, an integrated sports team formed. Toward the end of [[World War II]], Hammond was transferred to [[Fort Benning]], Georgia, known for its intense racism. Hammond was not the only jazz fan irritated with racism. During this time period, [[bebop]] music grew out of late night jam sessions of black musicians. Hammond was not much a part of the bebop movement, but he shared the sentiment against racism.<ref name=Prial />\n\nIn 1946, Hammond was discharged from the military. His family moved to [[Greenwich Village]], where Jemy gave birth to their third son, Jason. Hammond threw himself back into his work, which greatly upset his wife. In 1948, Jemy asked Hammond for a divorce. While he was originally reluctant, Hammond agreed to the divorce. Jemy never remarried.<ref name=Prial />\n\nA year later, in 1949, Hammond met Esme Sarnoff, originally Esme O'Brien, the former wife of [[NBC]] chairman Robert W. Sarnoff, and a daughter of Mary and Esmond O'Brien. Esme shared Hammond's musical passion and was planning to divorce her husband. That year, Hammond married Esme Sarnoff. By this marriage Hammond had one stepdaughter, (Esme) Rosita Sarnoff (born 1943). During this time, Hammond's father died on a golf course. Left a widow, Emily Hammond became infatuated with [[Frank Buchman]].<ref name=Prial />\n\nIn 1985, Hammond had his first stroke. Although this impaired him physically, his wife's death left him in despair. Esme Hammond was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. While treatments worked for some time, she died May 19, 1986,<ref>\"Esme Hammond, 66, A Prominent Socialite\"; ''The New York Times'' (May 22, 1986); Retrieved October 16, 2011.

Hammond was distraught and died on July 10, 1987, after a series of strokes.

In 1967, [[Holyoke Water Power Company]] (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the '''Public Service Company of New Hampshire''' ([[PSNH]], formed in 1926) followed.\n\nAfter some up-and-down growth under CEO [[Lelan Sillin]] (1970\u20131983) and his successor, William B. Ellis, PSNH declared bankruptcy in January 1988 due to problems getting a license for the completed [[Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/29/business/bankruptcy-filed-by-leading-utility-in-seabrook-plant.html |author=Lee A.

However, Con Edison backed out of the merger in 2001 after Connecticut's [[Attorney General]] [[Richard Blumenthal]] threatened lawsuits to block it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/06/nyregion/northeast-says-merger-with-con-edison-has-collapsed.html|title=Northeast Says Merger With Con Edison Has Collapsed|date=6 March 2001|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nLegislation passed in the late 1990s deregulated the electricity market in New England and required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers. In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's [[West Springfield Generating Station]] and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the [[Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility]]) were transferred to Northeast Generation.\n\nIn 2001, NU sold the assets and operations of its subsidiary, the Holyoke Water Power Company, to the [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|City of Holyoke]] including the HWP electrical distribution system and customer base and all generation with the exception of the [[Mount Tom Station|Mt. Tom coal-fired power plant]] which NU retained. The city's municipal gas and electric department assumed responsibility for the generators and absorbed the HWP distribution customer base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hged.com/html/our_history.html|title=History|work=hged.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref> Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&P, and PSNH's nuclear generating assets which consisted of their stakes in the [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant|Seabrook]], [[Millstone Nuclear Power Plant|Millstone]], and [[Vermont Yankee]] stations.\n\nIn November 2005, the company announced it would sell its unregulated competitive businesses, including generation and energy services.  In November 2006 the company had essentially completed the divestiture of its competitive businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/northeast-utilities-completes-sale-of-competitive-generation-business-to-energy-capital-partners-55838902.html|title=Northeast Utilities Completes Sale of Competitive Generation Business to Energy Capital Partners|author=Northeast Utilities|date=1 November 2006|work=prnewswire.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shut down its competitive generation business units.

PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose an alternative competitive supplier.\n\nIn October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]], the major electric and gas provider in [[Greater Boston]], with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2010/10/northeast_utili_2.html|title=NStar and Northeast Utilities agree to merger|last=Ailworth|first=Erin|date=2010-10-18|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref>  After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nu-closes-nstar-merger-deal-223023927.html|title=NU Closes NSTAR Merger Deal|date=2012-04-11|accessdate=2013-05-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the company (now known as Eversource) agreed to sell all of its New Hampshire generation assets in the same manner it sold its assets in Massachusetts and Connecticut between 2000 and 2006.

The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt [[Bethel-Norwalk transmission line]] through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.\n\nWith [[United Illuminating]], an upgrade to the 69-mile (112&nbsp;km), 345 kilovolt [[Middletown-Norwalk transmission line]] was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.\n\nIn 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.\n\nThe new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.\n\nIn May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.\n\nEversource has taken action to support the use of [[electric vehicle]]s. Starting in 2018, the company began spending $45 million over five years to install over 400 electric vehicle charging stations in Massachusetts. The project is part of the company's Grid Modernization plan. The company has switched much of its power source from coal to [[natural gas]], wind, [[hydroelectricity]] and solar power.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.masslive.com/business-news/index.ssf/2018/08/eversource_rolls_out_electric_car_charge.html|title=Eversource begins rollout of 400 electric car chargers across Massachusetts; 'range anxiety' seen as enemy to emissions progress|work=masslive.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==HVDC transmission (\"Northern Pass\" Project)==\nAs Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]] to build a new [[High-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) line from [[Windsor, Quebec]] (connecting with the [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's electricity transmission system|Quebec grid]]) to a location in [[Franklin, New Hampshire]].  It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains.  This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20081219/NEWS03/812190315/1004/NEWS03 |title=Utilities plan for N.E. expansion |work=Rutland Herald |first=Louis |last=Porter |date=19 December 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615232130/http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20081219/NEWS03/812190315/1004/NEWS03 |archive-date=15 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec had been an issue during the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2010|Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Beth |last=Daley |title=Canadian firm offers N.E. more hydropower |work=The Boston Globe |date=2010-10-23 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/10/23/canadian_firm_offers_ne_more_hydropower/?page=full |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> In November 2015, the [[Sierra Club]] of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of [[Boreal forest of Canada|Boreal forests]] during the construction of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the [[Innu]] First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the [[White Mountain National Forest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/quebec-is-facing-its-own-dirty-energy-problem/article27502571/?click=sf_globefb|title=Quebec is facing its own \u2018dirty\u2019 energy export problem|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 2018, Massachusetts Governor Baker selected this \"Northern Pass Transmission\" (NPT) project<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://commonwealthmagazine.org/energy/baker-goes-eversources-northern-pass/|title=Baker goes with Eversource\u2019s Northern Pass - CommonWealth Magazine|date=2018-01-25|work=CommonWealth Magazine|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}</ref> as the winner for a clean energy procurement RFP.\n\nHowever, days later on February 1, 2018, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee voted unanimously to deny<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2018/02/01/committee-votes-against-northern-pass|title=N.H.

I'm not happy with the lack of information my office has received.\" Golden, co-chairman of the Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, helped write the 2016 law that permits utilities to levy a new minimum monthly charge, and he told Eversource executives they were making it \"extremely, extremely difficult\" for him to continue to support them in the policy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lowellsun.com/breakingnews/ci_31633713/frustration-grows-over-eversource-solar-charge|title=Golden, Barrett upset over Eversource solar charge|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref>\n\n== Price manipulation controversy ==\nIn 2017, an environmental group accused Eversource and Avangrid of driving up electric, gas rates over several winters<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/talking-points/2017/10/13/the-week-business/Eooyag6H74Q83W4JewxSvI/story.html|title=The week in business - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> by buying up shipment capacity on a major pipeline that they ultimately did not use. The Environmental Defense Fund said both utilities routinely reserved big deliveries of natural gas on the Algonquin pipeline system for frigid days, but then sharply reduced those orders too late in the day for others to use that capacity.

In 1967, [[Holyoke Water Power Company]] (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the '''Public Service Company of New Hampshire''' ([[PSNH]], formed in 1926) followed.\n\nAfter some up-and-down growth under CEO [[Lelan Sillin]] (1970\u20131983) and his successor, William B.

In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's [[West Springfield Generating Station]] and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the [[Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility]]) were transferred to Northeast Generation.\n\nIn 2001, NU sold the assets and operations of its subsidiary, the Holyoke Water Power Company, to the [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|City of Holyoke]] including the HWP electrical distribution system and customer base and all generation with the exception of the [[Mount Tom Station|Mt. Tom coal-fired power plant]] which NU retained.

The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt [[Bethel-Norwalk transmission line]] through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.\n\nWith [[United Illuminating]], an upgrade to the 69-mile (112&nbsp;km), 345 kilovolt [[Middletown-Norwalk transmission line]] was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.\n\nIn 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.\n\nThe new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.\n\nIn May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.\n\nEversource has taken action to support the use of [[electric vehicle]]s. Starting in 2018, the company began spending $45 million over five years to install over 400 electric vehicle charging stations in Massachusetts. The project is part of the company's Grid Modernization plan. The company has switched much of its power source from coal to [[natural gas]], wind, [[hydroelectricity]] and solar power.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.masslive.com/business-news/index.ssf/2018/08/eversource_rolls_out_electric_car_charge.html|title=Eversource begins rollout of 400 electric car chargers across Massachusetts; 'range anxiety' seen as enemy to emissions progress|work=masslive.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==HVDC transmission (\"Northern Pass\" Project)==\nAs Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]] to build a new [[High-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) line from [[Windsor, Quebec]] (connecting with the [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's electricity transmission system|Quebec grid]]) to a location in [[Franklin, New Hampshire]].  It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains.

The Environmental Defense Fund said both utilities routinely reserved big deliveries of natural gas on the Algonquin pipeline system for frigid days, but then sharply reduced those orders too late in the day for others to use that capacity.

This prompted his mother to return to Ireland and Stuart's childhood was divided between his home in Ireland and [[Rugby School]] in England, where he boarded.\n\nIn 1920, at age 17, he became a Catholic and married [[Iseult Gonne]], [[Maud Gonne]]'s daughter. Maud Gonne's companion, [[Mary Barry O'Delaney]], stood as his godmother upon his conversion.<ref name=Maume>{{cite book|last1=Maume|first1=Patrick|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=O'Delaney, Mary Barry}}</ref> Aged 24 years, Iseult had had a romantic but unsettled life. Maud Gonne's estranged husband [[John MacBride]] was executed in 1916 for taking part in the [[Easter Rising]]. Iseult Gonne's father was the right-wing French politician, [[Lucien Millevoye]], with whom Maud Gonne had had an affair between 1887 and 1899. Because of her complex family situation, Iseult was often passed off as Maud Gonne's niece in conservative circles in Ireland. Iseult grew up in Paris and London. She had been proposed to by [[W. B. Yeats]] in 1917 (he had also earlier proposed to her mother; Yeats was 50 at the time, Iseult 20) and had a brief affair with [[Ezra Pound]] prior to meeting Stuart. Pound and Stuart both believed in the primacy of the artist over the masses and were subsequently drawn to [[fascism]]; Stuart to [[Nazi Germany]] and Pound to [[Fascist Italy]].\n\n==IRA involvement==\nGonne and Stuart had a baby daughter who died in infancy. Perhaps to recover from this tragedy, they travelled for a while in Europe but returned to Ireland as the [[Irish Civil War]] began. Unsurprisingly given Gonne's strong opinions, the couple were caught up on the anti-Treaty [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) side of this fight. Stuart was involved in gun running and was interned after a botched raid.\n\n==Literary career==\nAfter independence, Stuart participated in the literary life of [[Dublin]] and wrote poetry and novels. His novels were successful and his writing was publicly supported by Yeats. Yeats, however, seemed to have had mixed feelings for Stuart who was, after all, married to a woman he regarded almost as a daughter and, even, as a possible wife. In his poem \"Why should not Old Men be Mad?\" (1936) in which he lists what he regards as provocations to rage, he claims he has seen\n:\"A girl that knew all Dante once\n:Live to bear children to a dunce\"\nThe first of these lines is accepted as referring to Gonne and the second to Stuart (Elborn 1990).\n\nStuart and Gonne had three children, a daughter Dolores who died three months old, a son Ian and a daughter Katherine. Ian Stuart went on to become an artist and was married for a time to the sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] and later to the Berlin-trained artist and jewellery designer Anna Stuart [7] whom he first met in 1970. They gave Stuart three grandchildren; food entrepreneur Laragh, photographer Suki and sculptress Sophia.\n\nStuart's time with Gonne may not have been an entirely happy time; from the accounts given in his apparently autobiographical novels, both he and his wife struggled with personal demons and their internal anguish poisoned their marriage. In her letters to close friend William Butler Yeats, Iseult Gonne's mother Maud Gonne characterizes Francis Stuart as being emotionally, financially, and physically abusive towards Iseult: \"Stuart's conduct towards Iseult is shocking. While they were staying with me in Dublin he struck her & one day knocked her down. He threw her out of her own room with such violence that she fell on the landing half dressed at the feet of Claud Chevasse who was staying in the house at the time.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>  Another time, neighbors reported seeing a fire in the couple's house: \"They found Iseult in her dressing gown outside. Stuart had locked himself in her room from where the flames were coming. They could see him pouring petroleum. Finally he opened the door -- he had been burning Iseult's clothes to punish her! Frequently he locked her up without food.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>\n\n==Involvement with the Third Reich==\nIt was also during the 1930s that Stuart became friendly with German Intelligence ([[Abwehr]]) agent [[Helmut Clissmann]] and his Irish wife Elizabeth. Clissmann was working for the German Academic Exchange Service and the ''[[Deutsche Akademie]]'' (DA). He was facilitating academic exchanges between Ireland and the [[Third Reich]] but also forming connections which might be of benefit to German Intelligence. Clissmann was also a representative of the [[Nazi]] ''Auslandorganisation'' (AO) \u2013 the Nazi Party's foreign organisation \u2013 in pre-war Ireland.\n\nStuart was also friendly with the head of the German Legation in Dublin, Dr [[Eduard Hempel]], largely as a result of Maud Gonne MacBride's rapport with him. By 1938 Stuart was seeking a way out of his marriage and the provincialism of Irish life. Iseult intervened with Clissmann to arrange for Stuart to travel to Germany to give a series of academic lectures in conjunction with the DA. Stuart travelled to Germany in April 1939 and his host in Germany was Professor [[Walter F. Schirmer]], the senior member of the English faculty with the DA and [[Berlin University]]. He eventually visited Munich, Hamburg, Bonn and Cologne.

He was awarded one of the highest artistic accolades in Ireland, being elected a [[Saoi]] of [[Aosd\u00e1na]], before his death in 2000.<ref> Irish Times, In honour of Francis Stuart? October 10, 1996 [https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/in-honour-of-francis-stuart-1.94304]</ref> His years in [[Nazi Germany]] led to a great deal of controversy.<ref> The Guardian, February 4 2000, obituary of Francis Stuart [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/feb/04/2]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nFrancis Stuart was born in [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]], Australia<ref name=\"irishmeninparis\" /><ref name=\"ricorso\" /> on 29 April 1902 to [[Protestantism in Ireland|Irish Protestant]] parents, Henry Irwin Stuart and Elizabeth Barbara Isabel Montgomery; his father was an alcoholic and killed himself when Stuart was an infant. This prompted his mother to return to Ireland and Stuart's childhood was divided between his home in Ireland and [[Rugby School]] in England, where he boarded.\n\nIn 1920, at age 17, he became a Catholic and married [[Iseult Gonne]], [[Maud Gonne]]'s daughter. Maud Gonne's companion, [[Mary Barry O'Delaney]], stood as his godmother upon his conversion.<ref name=Maume>{{cite book|last1=Maume|first1=Patrick|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=O'Delaney, Mary Barry}}</ref> Aged 24 years, Iseult had had a romantic but unsettled life. Maud Gonne's estranged husband [[John MacBride]] was executed in 1916 for taking part in the [[Easter Rising]]. Iseult Gonne's own father was the right-wing French politician, [[Lucien Millevoye]], with whom Maud Gonne had had an affair between 1887 and 1899. Because of her complex family situation, Iseult was often passed off as Maud Gonne's niece in conservative circles in Ireland. Iseult grew up in Paris and London. She had been proposed to by [[W. B. Yeats]] in 1917 (he had also earlier proposed to her mother; Yeats was 50 at the time, Iseult 20) and had a brief affair with [[Ezra Pound]] prior to meeting Stuart. Pound and Stuart both believed in the primacy of the artist over the masses and were subsequently drawn to fascism: Stuart to [[Nazi Germany]] and Pound to [[fascism|fascist]] Italy.\n\n==IRA involvement==\nGonne and Stuart had a baby daughter who died in infancy. Perhaps to recover from this tragedy, they travelled for a while in Europe but returned to Ireland as the [[Irish Civil War]] began. Unsurprisingly given Gonne's strong opinions, the couple were caught up on the anti-Treaty [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) side of this fight. Stuart was involved in gun running and was interned after a botched raid.\n\n==Literary career==\nAfter independence, Stuart participated in the literary life of [[Dublin]] and wrote poetry and novels. His novels were successful and his writing was publicly supported by Yeats. Yeats, however, seemed to have had mixed feelings for Stuart who was, after all, married to a woman he regarded almost as a daughter and, even, as a possible wife. In his poem \"Why should not Old Men be Mad?\" (1936) in which he lists what he regards as provocations to rage, he claims he has seen\n:\"A girl that knew all Dante once\n:Live to bear children to a dunce\"\nThe first of these lines is accepted as referring to Gonne and the second to Stuart (Elborn 1990).\n\nStuart and Gonne had three children, a daughter Dolores who died three months old, a son Ian and a daughter Katherine. Ian Stuart went on to become an artist and was married for a time to the sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] and later to the Berlin-trained artist and jewellery designer Anna Stuart [7] whom he first met in 1970. They gave Stuart three grandchildren; food entrepreneur Laragh, photographer Suki and sculptress Sophia.\n\nStuart's time with Gonne may not have been an entirely happy time; from the accounts given in his apparently autobiographical novels, both he and his wife struggled with personal demons and their internal anguish poisoned their marriage. In her letters to close friend William Butler Yeats, Iseult Gonne's mother Maud Gonne characterizes Francis Stuart as being emotionally, financially, and physically abusive towards Iseult: \"Stuart's conduct towards Iseult is shocking. While they were staying with me in Dublin he struck her & one day knocked her down. He threw her out of her own room with such violence that she fell on the landing half dressed at the feet of Claud Chevasse who was staying in the house at the time.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>  Another time, neighbors reported seeing a fire in the couple's house: \"They found Iseult in her dressing gown outside. Stuart had locked himself in her room from where the flames were coming. They could see him pouring petroleum. Finally he opened the door -- he had been burning Iseult's clothes to punish her! Frequently he locked her up without food.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>\n\n==Involvement with the Third Reich==\nIt was also during the 1930s that Stuart became friendly with German Intelligence ([[Abwehr]]) agent [[Helmut Clissmann]] and his Irish wife Elizabeth. Clissmann was working for the German Academic Exchange Service and the ''[[Deutsche Akademie]]'' (DA). He was facilitating academic exchanges between Ireland and the [[Third Reich]] but also forming connections which might be of benefit to German Intelligence. Clissmann was also a representative of the [[Nazi]] ''Auslandorganisation'' (AO) \u2013 the Nazi Party's foreign organisation \u2013 in pre-war Ireland.\n\nStuart was also friendly with the head of the German Legation in Dublin, Dr [[Eduard Hempel]], largely as a result of Maud Gonne MacBride's rapport with him. By 1938 Stuart was seeking a way out of his marriage and the provincialism of Irish life. Iseult intervened with Clissmann to arrange for Stuart to travel to Germany to give a series of academic lectures in conjunction with the DA. Stuart travelled to Germany in April 1939 and his host in Germany was Professor [[Walter F. Schirmer]], the senior member of the English faculty with the DA and [[Berlin University]]. He eventually visited Munich, Hamburg, Bonn and Cologne. At the completion of his lecture tour he accepted an appointment as lecturer in English and Irish literature at Berlin University to begin in 1940, two years after Jews had been barred from German universities by the Nazis' [[Nuremberg Laws]].\n\nIn July 1939 Stuart returned home to [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]] and confirmed at the outbreak of war in September that he would still take the place in Berlin. When Stuart's plans for travelling to Germany were finalised, he received a visit from his brother-in-law, [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]], this meeting followed the seizure of an IRA radio transmitter on 29 December 1939, which had been used to contact Germany. Stuart, MacBride, [[Seamus O'Donovan]], and IRA Chief of Staff [[Stephen Hayes (Irish Republican)|Stephen Hayes]] then met at O'Donovan's house. Stuart was told to take a message to Abwehr HQ in Berlin. He travelled alone to [[Nazi Germany]], something that was possible because Ireland was neutral in the [[Second World War]], and arrived in Berlin during January 1940. Upon arrival he delivered the IRA message and had some discussion with the Abwehr on the conditions in Ireland and the fate of the IRA-Abwehr radio link. He also reactivated his acquaintance with Abwehr asset Helmut Clissmann who was acting as an advisor to SS Colonel Dr [[Edmund Vessenmayer]]. Through Clissmann Stuart was introduced to [[Sonderf\u00fchrer]] Kurt Haller. Around August 1940, Stuart was asked by Haller if he would participate in [[Operation Dove (Ireland)|Operation Dove]] and he agreed although he was later dropped in favour of [[Frank Ryan (Irish republican)|Frank Ryan]]. In so far as is known he had no further contact with German Intelligence although he did maintain links with Frank Ryan up to his death and funeral in June 1944.\n\n===Time in Berlin===\n\nBetween March 1942 and January 1944 Stuart worked as part of the ''Redaktion-Irland'' (also sometimes referred to as ''Irland-Redaktion'', \"''Editorial Ireland\"'' in English) team, reading radio broadcasts containing Nazi propaganda which were aimed at and heard in Ireland.

While the Aosd\u00e1na affair was ongoing, ''[[Irish Times]]'' columnist [[Kevin Myers]] attacked Stuart as a Nazi sympathiser; Stuart sued for [[libel]] and the case was settled out of court. The statement from the ''Irish Times'' read out in the High Court accepted \"that Mr Stuart never expressed anti-Semitism in his writings or otherwise\".<ref name=indo/>\n\nFor some years before his death he lived in [[County Clare]] with his partner Fionuala and in [[County Wicklow]] with his son Ian and daughter-in-law Anna in a house outside [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]] village.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Stuart died of natural causes on 2 February 2000 at the age of 97 in County Clare.\n\n==Works==\nStuart wrote many novels including ''Black List Section H'' (1971) {{ISBN|0-14-006229-7}}, his most well-known work which is heavily autobiographical.
