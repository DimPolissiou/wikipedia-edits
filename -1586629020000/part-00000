It was first developed in [[West Germany]] in 1959 as Fanta Klare Zitrone (\"Clear Lemon [[Fanta]]\") and was introduced in the United States under the current brand name Sprite in 1961 as a competitor to [[7 Up]].\n\n==Marketing==\nSprite advertising often makes use of the [[portmanteau]] word ''lymon'', a combination of the words \"lemon\" and \"lime\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2006/scene/columns/subliminal-ads-with-a-twist-of-lymon-1200337893/|title=Subliminal ads with a twist of lymon|last=Bing|first=Jonathan|last2=Bing|first2=Jonathan|date=2006-06-12|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-07-15}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1980s, Sprite had developed a large following among teenagers. In response, Sprite began to cater to this demographic in their advertisements in 1987. \"I Like the Sprite In You\" was the brand's first long-running slogan, and many jingles were produced around it before its discontinuation in 1994.\n\nIn 1994, Sprite revamped their marketing logo, and slogan, as well. The new, more vibrant logo stood out more on packaging, and featured a blue-to-green gradient with silver \"splashes\" and subtle white \"bubbles\" in the background. The product name, \"Sprite\" had a blue backdrop shadow on the logo. The words; \"Great Lymon Taste!\" which had been present on the previous logo, were removed. This logo was used in the United States until 2006, and similar variants were used in other countries until this year as well.\n\nThe brand's slogan was changed to; \"Obey Your Thirst\", and jingles containing it became urban-oriented, featuring a hip-hop theme. One of the first lyrics for the new slogan were: \"never forget yourself 'cause first things first, grab a cold, cold can, and obey your thirst.\u201d Under the new slogan, Sprite tapped into hip-hop culture by leveraging up and coming, as well as underground rap artists including; [[LL Cool J]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[KRS-One]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Grand Puba]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Nas]] and others in television commercials. Sprite expanded its urban connections in the late 1990s by featuring both amateur and accomplished basketball players in their advertisements. To this day, NBA players and hip-hop artists such as [[LeBron James]], [[Vince Staples]], and [[Lil Yachty]] frequently appear in Sprite adverts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/10/lil-yachty-sprite-ad-lebron-james/|title=Lil Yachty Stars in New Sprite Ad With LeBron James - XXL|publisher=|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, one commercial poked fun at products which featured cartoon [[mascots]] in the style of a horror film. In it, the mascot for a fictitious [[orange juice]] drink called \"Sun Fizz\" comes to life, terrifying the kids and mother, and starts to chase them. This commercial is also notorious for ending on a [[cliffhanger]] which still remains unresolved to this day.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 1990s, one of Sprite's longest-running ad campaigns was \"[[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant\nHill]] Drinks Sprite\" (overlapping its \"Obey Your Thirst\" campaign), in which the well-liked basketball player's abilities, and Sprite's importance in giving him his abilities, were humorously exaggerated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacafe.com/watch/47179/sprite_and_its_meaning/|title=Video is temporarily not available|first=|last=metacafe.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.advertisementave.com/tv/ad.asp?adid=116 AdvertisementAve.com - A Better Basketball Player?<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013132126/http://advertisementave.com/tv/ad.asp?adid=116 |date=October 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Sprite commissioned graffiti artist Temper to design limited edition art, which appeared on 100 million cans across Europe.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 2004, Coke created Miles Thirst, a vinyl doll voiced by [[Reno Wilson]], used in advertising to exploit the hip-hop market for soft drinks.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2004-04-25-sprite_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Theresa | last1=Howard | title=Coke creates hip-hop figure to inject Sprite with attitude | date=April 26, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a new Sprite logo, consisting of two yellow and green \"halves\" forming an \"S\" lemon/lime design, made its debut on Sprite bottles and cans. The slogan was changed from its long running \"Obey Your Thirst\" to just \"Obey\" in the United States and was outright replaced with \"Freedom From Thirst\" in many countries. This was the decade's first major shift in advertising themes.\n\nThe \"Sublymonal\" campaign was also used as part of the [[alternate reality game]] the ''[[Lost Experience]]''.<ref>[http://www.thelostexperience.com/2006/05/10/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315022639/http://www.thelostexperience.com/2006/05/10/ |date=March 15, 2009 }}</ref> This also resurrected the \"lymon\" word.\n\nSprite redesigned their label in 2009, removing the \"S\" logo.\n\nIn France in 2012, the drink was reformulated removing 30% of the sugar and replacing it with the sweetener Stevia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/health/introducing-stevia-sweetener.html |title=Stevia Sweetener UK: The New Zero-Calorie Sweetener From Natural Origins - Coca-Cola GB |publisher=Coca-cola.co.uk |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> This led to the drink containing fewer calories.

It was first developed in [[West Germany]] in 1959 as Fanta Klare Zitrone (\"Clear Lemon [[Fanta]]\") and was introduced in the United States under the current brand name Sprite in 1961 as a competitor to [[7 Up]].\n\n==Marketing==\nSprite advertising often makes use of the [[portmanteau]] word ''lymon'', a combination of the words \"lemon\" and \"lime\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2006/scene/columns/subliminal-ads-with-a-twist-of-lymon-1200337893/|title=Subliminal ads with a twist of lymon|last=Bing|first=Jonathan|last2=Bing|first2=Jonathan|date=2006-06-12|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-07-15}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1980s, Sprite had developed a large following among teenagers. In response, Sprite began to cater to this demographic in their advertisements in 1987. \"I Like the Sprite In You\" was the brand's first long-running slogan, and many jingles were produced around it before its discontinuation in 1994.\n\nIn 1994, Sprite revamped their marketing logo, and slogan, as well. The new, more vibrant logo stood out more on packaging, and featured a blue-to-green gradient with silver \"splashes\" and subtle white \"bubbles\" in the background. The product name, \"Sprite\" had a blue backdrop shadow on the logo. The words; \"Great Lymon Taste!\" which had been present on the previous logo, were removed. This logo was used in the United States until 2006, and similar variants were used in other countries until this year as well.\n\nThe brand's slogan was changed to; \"Obey Your Thirst\", and jingles containing it became urban-oriented, featuring a hip-hop theme. One of the first lyrics for the new slogan were: \"never forget yourself 'cause first things first, grab a cold, cold can, and obey your thirst.\u201d Under the new slogan, Sprite tapped into hip-hop culture by leveraging up and coming, as well as underground rap artists including; [[LL Cool J]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[KRS-One]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Grand Puba]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Nas]] and others in television commercials. Sprite expanded its urban connections in the late 1990s by featuring both amateur and accomplished basketball players in their advertisements. To this day, NBA players and hip-hop artists such as [[LeBron James]], [[Vince Staples]], and [[Lil Yachty]] frequently appear in Sprite adverts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/10/lil-yachty-sprite-ad-lebron-james/|title=Lil Yachty Stars in New Sprite Ad With LeBron James - XXL|publisher=|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, one commercial poked fun at products which featured cartoon [[mascots]] in the style of a horror film. In it, the mascot for a fictitious [[orange juice]] drink called \"Sun Fizz\" comes to life, terrifying the kids and mother, and starts to chase them. This commercial is also notorious for ending on a [[cliffhanger]] which still remains unresolved to this day.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 1990s, one of Sprite's longest-running ad campaigns was \"[[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant\nHill]] Drinks Sprite\" (overlapping its \"Obey Your Thirst\" campaign), in which the well-liked basketball player's abilities, and Sprite's importance in giving him his abilities, were humorously exaggerated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacafe.com/watch/47179/sprite_and_its_meaning/|title=Video is temporarily not available|first=|last=metacafe.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.advertisementave.com/tv/ad.asp?adid=116 AdvertisementAve.com - A Better Basketball Player?<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013132126/http://advertisementave.com/tv/ad.asp?adid=116 |date=October 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Sprite commissioned graffiti artist Temper to design limited edition art, which appeared on 100 million cans across Europe.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 2004, Coke created Miles Thirst, a vinyl doll voiced by [[Reno Wilson]], used in advertising to exploit the hip-hop market for soft drinks.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2004-04-25-sprite_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Theresa | last1=Howard | title=Coke creates hip-hop figure to inject Sprite with attitude | date=April 26, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a new Sprite logo, consisting of two yellow and green \"halves\" forming an \"S\" lemon/lime design, made its debut on Sprite bottles and cans. The slogan was changed from its long running \"Obey Your Thirst\" to just \"Obey\" in the United States and was outright replaced with \"Freedom From Thirst\" in many countries. This was the decade's first major shift in advertising themes.\n\nThe \"Sublymonal\" campaign was also used as part of the [[alternate reality game]] the ''[[Lost Experience]]''.<ref>[http://www.thelostexperience.com/2006/05/10/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315022639/http://www.thelostexperience.com/2006/05/10/ |date=March 15, 2009 }}</ref> This also resurrected the \"lymon\" word.\n\nSprite redesigned their label in 2009, removing the \"S\" logo.\n\nIn France in 2012, the drink was reformulated removing 30% of the sugar and replacing it with the sweetener Stevia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/health/introducing-stevia-sweetener.html |title=Stevia Sweetener UK: The New Zero-Calorie Sweetener From Natural Origins - Coca-Cola GB |publisher=Coca-cola.co.uk |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> This led to the drink containing fewer calories.
