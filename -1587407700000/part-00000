When Moe meets her in person, she turns out to be a [midget]. They remain in love, but his tactless attitude to her size eventually drives her away. Meanwhile, in an attempt to spend more time with [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] inadvertently drops her off at a playground full of bullies.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] attempts to spend more time with [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] and ends up bringing her to [[Moe's Tavern]]. [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] is cleaning up the bar for a date, and finds out he actually has a window, which was previously obscured by layers of grime. Outside the window is a playground, which Homer sees as an opportunity for watching Maggie while spending time at Moe's. Homer sends Maggie to play with the other babies outside, but they turn out to be ruthless bullies. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] notices Maggie is uncomfortable when she returns home one day, and becomes worried that Homer is neglecting her. After watching a commercial about a surveillance camera fixed in the eye of a teddy bear, Marge purchases a spy camera which she attaches to Maggie's hair band and discovers that Maggie is bullied by a group of gangster babies. At first, Marge is surprised to see Maggie being tormented by the babies, but sees Homer, after he discovered the truth about the other babies from the playground, rush to Maggie's rescue and be beaten up by Kearney's son. Maggie jumps to Homer's rescue and Homer says that he loves both her and Marge. Moved to tears, Marge tells Homer he is a wonderful father.\n\nMeanwhile, Moe's date, whom he met over the Internet, turns out to be a little person named Maya. Moe still loves her, but is worried about what his friends will think. Moe decides to take Maya on a double date with Marge and Homer, neither of whom seem to care that she is small. Homer, seeing Maya's intelligence and sensitivity, suggests Moe marry her. Moe proposes but cannot resist making jokes about Maya's height. Insulted, she rejects him. Crushed by grief, Moe consults the advice of [[Lenny and Carl]], who advise him to do something risky to win Maya back. Moe decides to have surgery to become shorter, and Dr. [[Nick Riviera]] agrees to conduct the surgery. Maya stops Moe just before the surgery, as she wants someone who sees her as \"beautiful\" not \"short\", and who does not need to cut himself down to her size in order to love her (even though [[Mr. Largo]] the music teacher was mistakenly given Moe's surgery instead of a sex change operation to look like [[Julie Newmar]]). Moe, intent on having the surgery, does not listen to Maya, and she leaves him for good. Homer consoles a dejected Moe, stating that even though things did not go well with Maya, Moe actually found love with a woman who loved him back and that if he was successful once, he will be successful again. Moe brightens up and wonders how a small woman like Maya could make him feel so big.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe title is a parody of the children's rhyme, \"[[Eeny Meeny Miny Moe]]\". Kearney's son banging the three bottles together on his fingers is reference to the 1979 film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]''.

When Moe turns on the television in Maya's house, it is showing a scene from ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' featuring the Oompa Loompas singing. Maya tells Moe that the photo of herself she shared with Moe over the internet was taken at [[Legoland]].

Like his two previous albums, it was produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] and features contributions from two members of Bowie's backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Trevor Bolder]]; [[Mick Woodmansey]] was replaced by [[Aynsley Dunbar]] on drums. It is a [[Cover version|covers album]], featuring covers of songs by bands such as the [[Pretty Things]], [[the Who]], [[the Yardbirds]] and [[Pink Floyd]].\n\nPreceded by [[Sorrow (The McCoys song)#David Bowie version|his cover]] of [[the McCoys]]' song \"[[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\", ''Pinups'' peaked at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], bringing the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six. However, since release, the album has received generally unfavorable reviews from music critics, many of whom criticised the songs as generally inferior to their original counterparts. It was remastered in 2015 as part of the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]''.<ref name=\"five years box set\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Five Years (1969\u20131973)|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=2015|publisher=[[Parlophone]]|location=UK, Europe & US|type=Box set liner notes|id=DBXL 1}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nAccording to co-producer [[Ken Scott]], the LP was originally conceived as \"a complete opposite of [Bowie's] other albums\", consisting of all cover songs except one original composition, and mainly turned towards the US market since \"he wanted to do songs that weren't known as well in the States as they were in England\", yet eventually the plan was dropped.<ref>{{citation |last1=Scott |first1=Ken |title=Abbey Road to Ziggy Stardust: Off-the-record with The Beatles, Bowie, Elton, and so much more. |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing Co. |edition=1st |year=2012}}</ref> ''Pinups'' was the first of two \"1960s nostalgia\" albums that Bowie had planned to release.

''Pinups'' entered the UK chart on 3 November 1973 (coincidentally the same day as [[Bryan Ferry]]'s covers album ''[[These Foolish Things (album)|These Foolish Things]]'') and stayed there for 21 weeks, eventually peaking at No. 1. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=115}} It re-entered the chart on 30 April 1983, this time for 15 weeks, peaking at No. 57. In July 1990, it again entered the chart, for one week, at No. 52. The lead single, a cover of [[the McCoys]]' \"[[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\", peaked at No. 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nSince release, the album has received generally unfavorable reviews from music critics, many of whom criticised the songs as generally inferior to their original counterparts. In a review for ''Pinups'' on release, Greg Shaw of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album an unfavorable review, writing, \"Although many of the tracks are excellent, none stands up to the originals.\"<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> He further believed that all the tracks were underproduced and believed Bowie's vocal performance to be the album's \"true failure\", believing his \"excessively mannered voice\" was \"a ridiculously weak mismatch for the material\" and that they were mixed too high to give the tracks the \"edge\" or \"punch\" they need to be effective.<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> He concludes his review saying, \"while ''Pinups'' may be a failure, it is also a collection of great songs, most of which are given a more than adequate, and always loving, treatment. Maybe the fairest conclusion to draw is that Bowie can\u2019t sing any other way, did the best he could, and the result isn\u2019t all that bad.\"<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> When reviewing the album as part of the 2015 box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'', Douglas Wolk of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' gave the album an unfavorable review, calling it a \"quick-and-sloppy covers album\".<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\" /> Although he believed the album was \"more interesting in theory\", he found that the execution was sloppy, believing that all the original versions were \"vastly\" superior and Bowie added nothing interesting to any of them. He further believed that it didn't help that [[the Spiders from Mars]] were falling apart when recording it.<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\" /> Bruce Eder of [[AllMusic]] similarly found the album to be out of place with Bowie's output up to that point.<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" /> He continued, \"''Ziggy Stardust'' and ''Aladdin Sane'' had established Bowie as perhaps the most fiercely original of all England's glam rockers, so an album of covers didn't make any sense and was especially confusing for American fans,\" further criticising the song choices as unknown.<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" /> However, Eder went on to praise Bowie's cover of \"Sorrow\", arguing that it's a \"distinct improvement\" over the original. He states that although the album is dismissed by many as just another covers album, Eder views it as an artistic statement and in the context of Bowie's entire career, it represented a \"swan song\" for the Spiders from Mars and an \"interlude\" between the first and second phases of his international career, with his next album ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' being the end of his glam rock era. He concludes his review writing, \"It's not a bad bridge between the two, and it has endured across the decades.\"<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" />\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Side one\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title1       = [[Rosalyn (song)|Rosalyn]]\n| writer1      = [[Jimmy Duncan (songwriter)|Jimmy Duncan]], Bill Farley\n| extra1       = [[Pretty Things]]\n| length1      = 2:27\n| title2       = [[Here Comes the Night]]\n| note2        = *\n| writer2      = [[Bert Berns]]\n| extra2       = [[Them (band)|Them]]\n| length2      = 3:09\n| title3       = [[I Wish You Would (Billy Boy Arnold song)|I Wish You Would]]\n| note3        = *\n| writer3      = [[Billy Boy Arnold]]\n| extra3       = [[The Yardbirds]]\n| length3      = 2:40\n| title4       = [[See Emily Play]]\n| writer4      = [[Syd Barrett]]\n| extra4       = [[Pink Floyd]]\n| length4      = 4:03\n| title5       = [[Everything's Alright (The Mojos song)|Everything's Alright]]\n| writer5      = Nicky Crouch, John Konrad, Simon Stavely, Stuart James, Keith Karlson\n| extra5       = [[The Mojos]]\n| length5      = 2:26\n| title6       = [[I Can't Explain]]\n| writer6      = [[Pete Townshend]]\n| extra6       = [[The Who]]\n| length6      = 2:07\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Side two\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title1       = [[Friday on My Mind]]\n| writer1      = [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]], [[Harry Vanda]]\n| extra1       = [[The Easybeats]]\n| length1      = 3:18\n| title2       = [[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\n| note2        = *\n| writer2      = Bob Feldman, [[Jerry Goldstein (record producer, musician)|Jerry Goldstein]], [[Richard Gottehrer]]\n| extra2       = [[The McCoys]]\n| length2      = 2:48\n| title3       = [[Don't Bring Me Down (Pretty Things song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]\n| writer3      = [[Fairies (British band)|Johnnie Dee]]\n| extra3       = [[Pretty Things]]\n| length3      = 2:01\n| title4      = [[Shapes of Things]]\n| writer4     = [[Paul Samwell-Smith]], [[Jim McCarty]], [[Keith Relf]]\n| extra4      = [[The Yardbirds]]\n| length4     = 2:47\n| title5      = [[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\n| writer5     = [[Roger Daltrey]], Townshend\n| extra5      = The Who\n| length5     = 3:04\n| title6      = [[Where Have All the Good Times Gone]]\n| writer6     = [[Ray Davies]]\n| extra6      = [[The Kinks]]\n| length6     = 2:35\n}}\n\n* Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1\u201312 on CD reissues.\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Bonus Tracks (1990 Rykodisc/EMI)\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title13      = [[Growin' Up]]\n| note13       = Previously unreleased; from the early ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' sessions\n| writer13     = [[Bruce Springsteen]]\n| extra13      = Bruce Springsteen\n| length13     = 3:26\n| title14      = [[Amsterdam (Jacques Brel song)|Port of Amsterdam]]\n| note14       = [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the \"Sorrow\" single\n| writer14     = [[Jacques Brel]], <abbr title=\"translated by\">trans.</abbr> [[Mort Shuman]]\n| extra14      = Jacques Brel\n| length14     = 3:19\n}}\n\nSongs marked with a <nowiki>*</nowiki> were not recorded for the first time by the acts listed, but were popularized by them.\n\n== Personnel ==\n*[[David Bowie]] \u2013 vocals, guitar, [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] and [[alto saxophone]], [[harmonica]], [[arrangement]]s, backing vocals, [[Moog synthesiser]]<ref name=allmusiccredits>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2484|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Pin Ups > Credits ))) |accessdate=15 July 2008 |publisher=allmusic}}</ref>\n*[[Mick Ronson]] \u2013 guitar, piano, vocals, arrangements<ref name=allmusiccredits />\n*[[Trevor Bolder]] \u2013 bass guitar\n*[[Aynsley Dunbar]] \u2013 drums\n\n=== Additional personnel ===\n*[[Mike Garson]] \u2013 piano, [[organ (music)|organ]], [[harpsichord]], [[electric piano]]<ref name=allmusiccredits />\n*Ken Fordham \u2013 [[baritone saxophone]]\n*[[Warren Peace|G.A.

Bowie]], released in October 1973 on [[RCA Records]]. Like his two previous albums, it was produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] and features contributions from two members of Bowie's backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Trevor Bolder]]; [[Mick Woodmansey]] was replaced by [[Aynsley Dunbar]] on drums. It is a [[Cover version|covers album]], featuring covers of songs by bands such as the [[Pretty Things]], [[the Who]], [[the Yardbirds]] and [[Pink Floyd]].\n\nPreceded by [[Sorrow (The McCoys song)#David Bowie version|his cover]] of [[the McCoys]]' song \"[[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\", ''Pinups'' peaked at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], bringing the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six. However, since release, the album has received generally unfavorable reviews from music critics, many of whom criticised the songs as generally inferior to their original counterparts. It was remastered in 2015 as part of the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]''.<ref name=\"five years box set\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Five Years (1969\u20131973)|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=2015|publisher=[[Parlophone]]|location=UK, Europe & US|type=Box set liner notes|id=DBXL 1}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nAccording to co-producer [[Ken Scott]], the LP was originally conceived as \"a complete opposite of [Bowie's] other albums\", consisting of all cover songs except one original composition, and mainly turned towards the US market since \"he wanted to do songs that weren't known as well in the States as they were in England\", yet eventually the plan was dropped.<ref>{{citation |last1=Scott |first1=Ken |title=Abbey Road to Ziggy Stardust: Off-the-record with The Beatles, Bowie, Elton, and so much more. |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing Co. |edition=1st |year=2012}}</ref> ''Pinups'' was the first of two \"1960s nostalgia\" albums that Bowie had planned to release.

''Pinups'' entered the UK chart on 3 November 1973 (coincidentally the same day as [[Bryan Ferry]]'s covers album ''[[These Foolish Things (album)|These Foolish Things]]'') and stayed there for 21 weeks, eventually peaking at No. 1. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=115}} It re-entered the chart on 30 April 1983, this time for 15 weeks, peaking at No. 57. In July 1990, it again entered the chart, for one week, at No. 52. The lead single, a cover of [[the McCoys]]' \"[[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\", peaked at No. 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nSince release, the album has received generally unfavorable reviews from music critics, many of whom criticised the songs as generally inferior to their original counterparts. In a review for ''Pinups'' on release, Greg Shaw of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album an unfavorable review, writing, \"Although many of the tracks are excellent, none stands up to the originals.\"<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> He further believed that all the tracks were underproduced and believed Bowie's vocal performance to be the album's \"true failure\", believing his \"excessively mannered voice\" was \"a ridiculously weak mismatch for the material\" and that they were mixed too high to give the tracks the \"edge\" or \"punch\" they need to be effective.<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> He concludes his review saying, \"while ''Pinups'' may be a failure, it is also a collection of great songs, most of which are given a more than adequate, and always loving, treatment. Maybe the fairest conclusion to draw is that Bowie can\u2019t sing any other way, did the best he could, and the result isn\u2019t all that bad.\"<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> When reviewing the album as part of the 2015 box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'', Douglas Wolk of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' gave the album an unfavorable review, calling it a \"quick-and-sloppy covers album\".<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\" /> Although he believed the album was \"more interesting in theory\", he found that the execution was sloppy, believing that all the original versions were \"vastly\" superior and Bowie added nothing interesting to any of them. He further believed that it didn't help that [[the Spiders from Mars]] were falling apart when recording it.<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\" /> Bruce Eder of [[AllMusic]] similarly found the album to be out of place with Bowie's output up to that point.<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" /> He continued, \"''Ziggy Stardust'' and ''Aladdin Sane'' had established Bowie as perhaps the most fiercely original of all England's glam rockers, so an album of covers didn't make any sense and was especially confusing for American fans,\" further criticising the song choices as unknown.<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" /> However, Eder went on to praise Bowie's cover of \"Sorrow\", arguing that it's a \"distinct improvement\" over the original. He states that although the album is dismissed by many as just another covers album, Eder views it as an artistic statement and in the context of Bowie's entire career, it represented a \"swan song\" for the Spiders from Mars and an \"interlude\" between the first and second phases of his international career, with his next album ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' being the end of his glam rock era. He concludes his review writing, \"It's not a bad bridge between the two, and it has endured across the decades.\"<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" />\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Side one\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title1       = [[Rosalyn (song)|Rosalyn]]\n| writer1      = [[Jimmy Duncan (songwriter)|Jimmy Duncan]], Bill Farley\n| extra1       = [[Pretty Things]]\n| length1      = 2:27\n| title2       = [[Here Comes the Night]]\n| note2        = *\n| writer2      = [[Bert Berns]]\n| extra2       = [[Them (band)|Them]]\n| length2      = 3:09\n| title3       = [[I Wish You Would (Billy Boy Arnold song)|I Wish You Would]]\n| note3        = *\n| writer3      = [[Billy Boy Arnold]]\n| extra3       = [[The Yardbirds]]\n| length3      = 2:40\n| title4       = [[See Emily Play]]\n| writer4      = [[Syd Barrett]]\n| extra4       = [[Pink Floyd]]\n| length4      = 4:03\n| title5       = [[Everything's Alright (The Mojos song)|Everything's Alright]]\n| writer5      = Nicky Crouch, John Konrad, Simon Stavely, Stuart James, Keith Karlson\n| extra5       = [[The Mojos]]\n| length5      = 2:26\n| title6       = [[I Can't Explain]]\n| writer6      = [[Pete Townshend]]\n| extra6       = [[The Who]]\n| length6      = 2:07\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Side two\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title1       = [[Friday on My Mind]]\n| writer1      = [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]], [[Harry Vanda]]\n| extra1       = [[The Easybeats]]\n| length1      = 3:18\n| title2       = [[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\n| note2        = *\n| writer2      = Bob Feldman, [[Jerry Goldstein (record producer, musician)|Jerry Goldstein]], [[Richard Gottehrer]]\n| extra2       = [[The McCoys]]\n| length2      = 2:48\n| title3       = [[Don't Bring Me Down (Pretty Things song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]\n| writer3      = [[Fairies (British band)|Johnnie Dee]]\n| extra3       = [[Pretty Things]]\n| length3      = 2:01\n| title4      = [[Shapes of Things]]\n| writer4     = [[Paul Samwell-Smith]], [[Jim McCarty]], [[Keith Relf]]\n| extra4      = [[The Yardbirds]]\n| length4     = 2:47\n| title5      = [[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\n| writer5     = [[Roger Daltrey]], Townshend\n| extra5      = The Who\n| length5     = 3:04\n| title6      = [[Where Have All the Good Times Gone]]\n| writer6     = [[Ray Davies]]\n| extra6      = [[The Kinks]]\n| length6     = 2:35\n}}\n\n* Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1\u201312 on CD reissues.\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Bonus Tracks (1990 Rykodisc/EMI)\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title13      = [[Growin' Up]]\n| note13       = Previously unreleased; from the early ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' sessions\n| writer13     = [[Bruce Springsteen]]\n| extra13      = Bruce Springsteen\n| length13     = 3:26\n| title14      = [[Amsterdam (Jacques Brel song)|Port of Amsterdam]]\n| note14       = [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the \"Sorrow\" single\n| writer14     = [[Jacques Brel]], <abbr title=\"translated by\">trans.</abbr> [[Mort Shuman]]\n| extra14      = Jacques Brel\n| length14     = 3:19\n}}\n\nSongs marked with a <nowiki>*</nowiki> were not recorded for the first time by the acts listed, but were popularized by them.\n\n== Personnel ==\n*[[David Bowie]] \u2013 vocals, guitar, [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] and [[alto saxophone]], [[harmonica]], [[arrangement]]s, backing vocals, [[Moog synthesiser]]<ref name=allmusiccredits>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2484|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Pin Ups > Credits ))) |accessdate=15 July 2008 |publisher=allmusic}}</ref>\n*[[Mick Ronson]] \u2013 guitar, piano, vocals, arrangements<ref name=allmusiccredits />\n*[[Trevor Bolder]] \u2013 bass guitar\n*[[Aynsley Dunbar]] \u2013 drums\n\n=== Additional personnel ===\n*[[Mike Garson]] \u2013 piano, [[organ (music)|organ]], [[harpsichord]], [[electric piano]]<ref name=allmusiccredits />\n*Ken Fordham \u2013 [[baritone saxophone]]\n*[[Warren Peace|G.A.

Produced by Bowie himself and recorded in early 1974 at [[Olympic Studios|Olympic]] and [[Sarm West Studios|Island Studios]] in London and Ludolph Studios in the Netherlands, it was Bowie's first album since 1970 to not feature contributions from his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. Thematically, it is a marriage of the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]] and Bowie's own [[glam rock|glam]]-tinged vision of a post-apocalyptic world. Bowie had wanted to make a theatrical production of Orwell's book and began writing material after completing sessions for his 1973 album ''[[Pin Ups]]'', but the author's estate denied the rights.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination\u2014David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': pp. 208\u201317</ref> The songs wound up on the second half of ''Diamond Dogs'' instead where, as the titles indicated, the ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' theme was prominent. It was also Bowie's final album in the glam rock genre; he would explore [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Soul music|soul]] music on his next album ''[[Young Americans]]''.\n\nBacked by the lead single \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\", ''Diamond Dogs'' was a commercial success, peaking at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 5 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, but nevertheless, was ranked number 995 in ''[[All Time Top 1000 Albums]]'' (2000) and number 447 in [[NME's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|''NME''{{'}}s The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. Bowie supported the album on the [[Diamond Dogs Tour]]; performances from the tour have been released on multiple live albums, including ''[[David Live]]'' (1974) and ''[[Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles '74)|Cracked Actor]]'' (2017). The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\n==Production and style==\nThough the album was recorded and released after the 'retirement' of [[David Bowie#Ziggy Stardust|Ziggy Stardust]] in mid-1973, and featured its own lead character in Halloween Jack (\"a real cool cat\" who lives in the decaying \"Hunger City\"), Ziggy was seen to be still very much alive in ''Diamond Dogs'', as evident from Bowie's haircut on the cover and the glam-trash style of the first single \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> As was the case with some songs on ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'', the influence of [[the Rolling Stones]] was also evident, particularly in the chugging [[Diamond Dogs (song)|title-track]].<ref name=\"Pegg 2000 63\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': p. 63</ref> Elsewhere, however, Bowie had moved on from his earlier work with the epic song suite, \"[[Sweet Thing (David Bowie song)|Sweet Thing]]\"/\"Candidate\"/\"Sweet Thing (Reprise)\", whilst \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" and the ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]''-inspired wah-wah guitar style of \"[[1984 (song)|1984]]\" provided a foretaste of Bowie's next, '[[plastic soul]]', phase. The original vinyl album ended with a juddering refrain ''Bruh/bruh/bruh/bruh/bruh'', the first syllable of \"(Big) Brother\", repeats incessantly.<ref>[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp. 63\u201364</ref> \"Sweet Thing\" was Bowie's first try at [[William S. Burroughs]]' [[Cut-up technique|cut-up style]] of writing, which Bowie would continue to use for the next 25 years.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kamp |first1=Thomas |title=David Bowie: The Wild-Eyed Boy 1964\u20131984 |publisher=O'Sullivan, Woodside & Co. |edition=1st |year=1985 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough ''Diamond Dogs'' was the first Bowie album since 1969 to not feature any of [[the Spiders from Mars]], the backing band made famous by Ziggy Stardust, many of the arrangements were already worked out and played on tour with [[Mick Ronson]] prior to the studio recordings, including \"1984\" and \"Rebel Rebel\". In the studio, however, [[Herbie Flowers]] played bass with drums being shared between [[Aynsley Dunbar]] and [[Tony Newman (drummer)|Tony Newman]]. In a move that surprised some commentators, Bowie himself took on the lead guitar role previously held by Ronson, producing what ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] described as a \"scratchy, raucous, semi-amateurish sound that gave the album much of its characteristic flavour\".<ref>Carr & Murray 1981). Op cit: p.14</ref> ''Diamond Dogs'' was also a milestone in Bowie's career as it reunited him with [[Tony Visconti]], who provided string arrangements and helped mix the album at his own studio in London. Visconti would go on to co-produce much of Bowie's work for the rest of the decade.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/>\n\n== Packaging ==\nThe [[cover art]]work features Bowie as a striking half-man, half-dog [[grotesque]] painted by Belgian artist [[Guy Peellaert]], based on photographs of Bowie by [[Terry O'Neill (photographer)|Terry O'Neill]]. It was controversial as the full image on the [[gatefold]] cover showed the hybrid's genitalia. The genitalia were thus [[airbrush]]ed out from the 1974 LP's sleeve on most releases. Very few copies of this original cover made their way into circulation at the time of the album's release.<ref name=\"Pegg 2016 371\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': p. 63</ref> According to the record-collector publication ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]'' price guides, these albums have been among the most expensive record collectibles of all time, as high as thousands of US dollars for a single copy.<ref>Dave Thompson (2015). ''Goldmine Record Album Price Guide'': p. 69</ref> The original image was included on the [[Rykodisc]]/[[EMI]] rerelease of the album in 1990, and subsequent reissues have included the uncensored artwork (the 1990 packaging also resurrected a rejected inner gatefold image featuring Bowie in a [[sombrero cordob\u00e9s]] holding onto a ravenous dog; like the cover, this artwork was a Guy Peellaert image based on a photograph captured by Terry O'Neill<ref>Terry O'Neill (1985).

Op cit: p.64</ref> Bowie himself described the Diamond Dogs, introduced in the title song, as: \"all little [[John Lydon|Johnny Rottens]] and [[Sid Vicious]]es really. And, in my mind, there was no means of transport, so they were all rolling around on these roller-skates with huge wheels on them, and they squeaked because they hadn't been oiled properly.

Produced by Bowie himself and recorded in early 1974 at [[Olympic Studios|Olympic]] and [[Sarm West Studios|Island Studios]] in London and Ludolph Studios in the Netherlands, it was Bowie's first album since 1970 to not feature contributions from his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. Thematically, it is a marriage of the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]] and Bowie's own [[glam rock|glam]]-tinged vision of a post-apocalyptic world. Bowie had wanted to make a theatrical production of Orwell's book and began writing material after completing sessions for his 1973 album ''[[Pin Ups]]'', but the author's estate denied the rights.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination\u2014David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': pp. 208\u201317</ref> The songs wound up on the second half of ''Diamond Dogs'' instead where, as the titles indicated, the ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' theme was prominent. It was also Bowie's final album in the glam rock genre; he would explore [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Soul music|soul]] music on his next album ''[[Young Americans]]''.\n\nBacked by the lead single \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\", ''Diamond Dogs'' was a commercial success, peaking at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 5 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, but nevertheless, was ranked number 995 in ''[[All Time Top 1000 Albums]]'' (2000) and number 447 in [[NME's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|''NME''{{'}}s The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. Bowie supported the album on the [[Diamond Dogs Tour]]; performances from the tour have been released on multiple live albums, including ''[[David Live]]'' (1974) and ''[[Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles '74)|Cracked Actor]]'' (2017). The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\n==Production and style==\nThough the album was recorded and released after the 'retirement' of [[David Bowie#Ziggy Stardust|Ziggy Stardust]] in mid-1973, and featured its own lead character in Halloween Jack (\"a real cool cat\" who lives in the decaying \"Hunger City\"), Ziggy was seen to be still very much alive in ''Diamond Dogs'', as evident from Bowie's haircut on the cover and the glam-trash style of the first single \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> As was the case with some songs on ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'', the influence of [[the Rolling Stones]] was also evident, particularly in the chugging [[Diamond Dogs (song)|title-track]].<ref name=\"Pegg 2000 63\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': p. 63</ref> Elsewhere, however, Bowie had moved on from his earlier work with the epic song suite, \"[[Sweet Thing (David Bowie song)|Sweet Thing]]\"/\"Candidate\"/\"Sweet Thing (Reprise)\", whilst \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" and the ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]''-inspired wah-wah guitar style of \"[[1984 (song)|1984]]\" provided a foretaste of Bowie's next, '[[plastic soul]]', phase. The original vinyl album ended with a juddering refrain ''Bruh/bruh/bruh/bruh/bruh'', the first syllable of \"(Big) Brother\", repeats incessantly.<ref>[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp. 63\u201364</ref> \"Sweet Thing\" was Bowie's first try at [[William S. Burroughs]]' [[Cut-up technique|cut-up style]] of writing, which Bowie would continue to use for the next 25 years.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kamp |first1=Thomas |title=David Bowie: The Wild-Eyed Boy 1964\u20131984 |publisher=O'Sullivan, Woodside & Co. |edition=1st |year=1985 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough ''Diamond Dogs'' was the first Bowie album since 1969 to not feature any of [[the Spiders from Mars]], the backing band made famous by Ziggy Stardust, many of the arrangements were already worked out and played on tour with [[Mick Ronson]] prior to the studio recordings, including \"1984\" and \"Rebel Rebel\". In the studio, however, [[Herbie Flowers]] played bass with drums being shared between [[Aynsley Dunbar]] and [[Tony Newman (drummer)|Tony Newman]]. In a move that surprised some commentators, Bowie himself took on the lead guitar role previously held by Ronson, producing what ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] described as a \"scratchy, raucous, semi-amateurish sound that gave the album much of its characteristic flavour\".<ref>Carr & Murray 1981). Op cit: p.14</ref> ''Diamond Dogs'' was also a milestone in Bowie's career as it reunited him with [[Tony Visconti]], who provided string arrangements and helped mix the album at his own studio in London. Visconti would go on to co-produce much of Bowie's work for the rest of the decade.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/>\n\n== Packaging ==\nThe [[cover art]]work features Bowie as a striking half-man, half-dog [[grotesque]] painted by Belgian artist [[Guy Peellaert]], based on photographs of Bowie by [[Terry O'Neill (photographer)|Terry O'Neill]]. It was controversial as the full image on the [[gatefold]] cover showed the hybrid's genitalia. The genitalia were thus [[airbrush]]ed out from the 1974 LP's sleeve on most releases. Very few copies of this original cover made their way into circulation at the time of the album's release.<ref name=\"Pegg 2016 371\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': p. 63</ref> According to the record-collector publication ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]'' price guides, these albums have been among the most expensive record collectibles of all time, as high as thousands of US dollars for a single copy.<ref>Dave Thompson (2015).
