{"title_page": "Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano", "text_new": "The '''''Trio pour hautbois, basson et piano''''' ('''Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano'''), [[FP (Poulenc)|FP]] 43, by [[Francis Poulenc]] is a three-movement [[chamber music|chamber work]], composed between 1924 and 1926, and premiered in the latter year.\n\nThe Trio was well-received at its premiere in Paris, with the composer at the piano. It has been performed and recorded frequently since. Critics have praised the work's depth of feeling, noting touches of Mozartian flavour and echoes of other composers' styles. It is regarded as the first major chamber work by Poulenc.\n\n== Background and first performance ==\nBy 1924 the 25-year-old Poulenc had become fairly well known in France, and to some extent elsewhere. First as a member of [[Les Six]] around the start of the decade, and then with his music for the ballet ''[[Les biches]]'' in 1924, he had established himself as a rising young composer.<ref>Hell (1959), pp. 17\u201321 and 28</ref> He had composed several chamber works, including the [[Sonata for clarinet and bassoon]] and the [[Sonata for horn, trumpet and trombone]] (both 1922),<ref>Nichols, p. 348</ref> and he began work on a trio for oboe, bassoon and piano in May 1924.<ref name=n62/>{{refn|Ideas for the trio had begun to form in his mind as early as 1921.<ref name=ns>Simeone, Nigel (2020).

While there he met [[Igor Stravinsky]] who gave him some good advice (\"quelques bons conseils\") that helped him with the final version of the first movement of the new piece.<ref>Car\u00e9, pp. 11\u201312</ref>\n\nPoulenc dedicated the Trio to [[Manuel de Falla]], who was delighted with the work and promised to organise and take part in a performance in Spain as soon as possible.<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 12</ref> The first performance of the Trio was given at the Salle des Agriculteurs in Paris on 2 May 1926 in a concert at which two other Poulenc works, ''Napoli'' and ''[[Chansons gaillardes]]'', were also premiered.<ref name=n71>Nichols, p. 71</ref>{{refn|''Napoli'' was played by [[Marcelle Meyer]] and the chansons were sung by [[Pierre Bernac]].<ref name=n71/>|group=n}} The work was given again the following day.<ref name=men>\"Concerts de la Revue Musicale\", ''[[Le M\u00e9nestrel]]'', 14 May 1926, p. 223</ref>  The players were Roger Lamorlette (oboe), Gustave Dh\u00e9rin (bassoon) and the composer (piano).<ref>Schmidt, p. 149</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nThe Trio is in three movements \u2013 [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Presto]], [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Andante]] and [[Rondo]].

He preferred what he called an \"episodic\" style, in which a theme is presented with no development and is followed by a contrasting theme, similarly treated.<ref>Nichols, p. 64</ref> Nevertheless, many years after the work was written, Poulenc told [[Claude Rostand]]:\n{{blockindent|For those who think I don't care about form, I've no objection to unveiling my secrets here: the first movement follows the plan of a [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] Allegro, and the final Rondo the shape of the scherzo in [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Second Piano Concerto]].

First, the piano is heard in a series of bare chords; the bassoon joins in in the fourth bar and the oboe in the eighth.

The opening theme, in B-flat major is a gentle {{music|time|4|8}} tune. There are further echoes of Gluck, with a quotation from his \"[[The Dance of the Blessed Spirits|Dance of the Blessed Spirits]]\".<ref name=m15>Mellers, p. 15</ref> The oboe has a melody of \"melancholy grace\".<ref>Hell (1978),  p. 83</ref> The mood becomes less idyllic towards the end of the movement: in Mellers's words, \"the delights of pastoral F major [become] shadowed with chromatics\", and the final chord is in F minor, a key associated with [[dirges]].<ref name=m15/>\n\n===III: Rondo ===\nThe last movement (\u2669. = 138\u2013144) is marked \"tr\u00e8s vif\" \u2013 very lively. The music maintains what Car\u00e9 calls a frenzy of movement (\"fr\u00e9n\u00e9sie du mouvement\"),<ref name=c14>Car\u00e9, p. 14</ref> the piano playing without a single bar's rest, and the \"ironic voice\" of the oboe contrasting with the bassoon.<ref name=h84>Hell (1978), p. 84</ref> The impetus continues unflaggingly throughout: Poulenc instructs the players not to slow down in the closing bars (\"sans ralentir\").

Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis.

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing. At least one reported polio patient, [[Dianne Odell]], had a spinal deformity that caused the use of mechanical ventilators to be [[contraindicated]].<ref name=Sydney2008>{{cite news|author=|title=Power failure kills iron lung lady|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-05-29|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/world/power-failure-kills-iron-lung-lady/2008/05/29/1211654160059.html|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> There are patients who today still use the older machines, often in their homes, despite the occasional difficulty of finding the various replacement parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/60-years-iron-lung-us-polio-survivor-worries-about-new-2D11641456|title=60 years in an iron lung: US polio survivor worries about new global threat|publisher=}}</ref> Joan Headley of [[Post-Polio Health International]] said that as of May 28, 2008, there were about 30 patients in the U.S. still using an iron lung.<ref name=CNN2008>{{cite news|title=Woman dies after life spent in iron lung |date=May 28, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |accessdate=2011-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022162511/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}</ref> That figure may be inaccurately low; [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] alone had 19 iron lung patients living at home in 2008.<ref name=Neergaard2009>{{cite news|author=Lauran Neergaard|title=Emergency officials struggle to find those on life-support during power outages|date=2009-01-13|url=http://www.ems1.com/survivability/articles/447100-Emergency-officials-struggle-to-find-those-on-life-support-during-power-outages|accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref> [[Martha Mason (writer)|Martha Mason]] of [[Lattimore, North Carolina]], died on May 4, 2009, after spending 60 of her 72 years in an iron lung.<ref name=Fox2009>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Martha Mason, Who Wrote Book About Her Decades in an Iron Lung, Dies at 71|work=The New York Times|date=2009-05-10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/us/10mason.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=iron%20lung&st=cse|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2009, [[June Middleton]] of [[Melbourne, Australia]], who had been entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the person who spent the longest time in an iron lung, died aged 83, having spent more than 60 years in her iron lung.<ref name=Sydney2009>{{cite news|author=|title=Dead after 60 years in iron lung|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2009-11-01|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-after-60-years-in-iron-lung-20091101-hqyy.html?autostart=1|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[Post-Polio Health International]] (PHI) organizations estimated that there were only six to eight iron lung users in the United States; as of 2017 its executive director knew of none.
