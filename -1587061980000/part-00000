The [[Government of India]] initially refused to allow these visits without giving a reason.

OTD expressed how the Karma Kamtsang forefathers and disciples maintained and propagated the teachings through study, teaching, and practice; thus, ripened generations of disciples through their wisdom, love, and power. OTD related that this activity of ''ripening'' disciples is the essential heart of the Kagyu history, the majesty and the true weight of the Kagyu teachings. He said that we need to continue to uphold the Lineage by preserving these fine deeds and activities. However, OTD warned, if we instead spend most of our time being biased, factional, and partisan\u2014this is extremely dangerous. If we are partisan and factional, we won't see the faults on our own side, or the qualities on the other. We won't be able to recognize what is good and what is bad. OTD said: \"For that reason, it is a situation where we absolutely must be careful. So this is why I asked His Holiness Thaye Dorje for a meeting this year.\" Furthermore, OTD emphasized that whether reconciliation goes well or not does not depend upon only the two claimants, OTD and TTD. It depends on all the followers and the whole community of the Karma Kamtsang.\n\nIn addition, OTD implored everyone to take as expansive a view as possible, to consider the long-term survival of the Karma Kagyu lineage. He said that those with a very short-term view may think that it was pointless for him to meet with TTD. Likewise, some people might think that OTD, by meeting with TTD, ended up losing\u2014that he was defeated. But he said that victory and defeat is a very short-term worldly way of speaking, and that the long-term danger is that the lineage of the Karma Kagyu will disappear without a trace. Considering this grave danger, OTD said that losing face, victory and defeat, are really not important. In conclusion, OTD requested everyone to please keep this explanation in mind.\n\n=== 2019: Joint Long Life Prayer for Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche\u2019s Reincarnation ===\nOn Oct. 27, 2019 OTD and TTD released a co-authored long life prayer for Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche\u2019s reincarnation.

Tibetan language is the lifeline that links Tibetans to their culture, arts, and spirituality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/the-gyalwang-karmapa-rings-an-alarm-we-must-preserve-tibetan-language-and-culture/|title=The Gyalwang Karmapa Rings an Alarm: We Must Preserve Tibetan Language and Culture {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/the-importance-of-harmony-among-tibetans/|title=The Importance of Harmony among Tibetans {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/a-wide-ranging-interview-with-the-gyalwang-karmapa/|title=A Wide-Ranging Interview with the Gyalwang Karmapa {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> Tibetan culture, he states, is the mind and life force of the Tibetan people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/language-as-the-link-unity-as-the-future-the-gyalwang-karmapa-speaks-at-the-56th-anniversary-of-the-upper-tcv/|title=Language as the Link, Unity as the Future: The Gyalwang Karmapa Speaks at the 56th Anniversary of the Upper TCV {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\nStressing the importance of Tibetan harmony and unity, Gyalwang Karmapa has implored all Tibetans to exercise religious tolerance, stating that all Buddhist traditions in Tibet come from one source, the Buddha, so the differences between them are not great. He has warned that it is a huge mistake to inflate small distinctions into a basis for attachment and hatred, asserting one\u2019s own tradition to be better than another\u2019s. He has said that the reason for any future decline of the Buddha\u2019s Dharma would not come from outside, but from within, from disputes between the holders of his teachings. Therefore, Gyalwang Karmapa has reiterated time and time again that the differences between lineages and factions are minor in terms of view, meditation, and conduct, and has urged everyone to keep a broader non-partisan perspective in mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/tibetan-unity-and-language-are-crucial/|title=Tibetan Unity and Language Are Crucial {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 108 Translations ===\n108 Translations was initiated in 2015 by H.H. Karmapa Orgyen Trinley Dorje. Born of a concept developed during a translators\u2019 workshop held at [http://latse.org Latse] and presided over by Gyalwang Karmapa, the aim of the 108 Translations project is to produce a needed body of reading material that can promote the reinvigoration of Tibetan language. Rather than focussing on translating a few famous works that match the interests of a small group of well-educated readers (which has been the case for translations into Tibetan up to the present), 108 Translations aims to provide a plethora of good and easily accessible reading materials for ''average'' Tibetan readers.\n\nIn his [https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/ Statement of Purpose], Gyalwang Karmapa expressed that we are currently inhabiting a time where there is great concern that the Tibetan language will go extinct. He has said that we have come to the point where we need to take responsibility for the survival of the Tibetan language, and we are in a situation where there is very little reading material that matches the interests of the ordinary Tibetan reader.\n\nThe main criteria for the 108 Translations is that they don't lose the meaning and feeling (or \"flavour\") of the original, the translations must be easy to understand and pronounce in Tibetan, and the selected works need to meet the interests of the readership. For example, translations of famous literary works that have a low readership are examples of unsuccessful translations. 108 Translations must not only consider how well known the works are, they must also examine how they have sold, how many other languages they have been translated into, and so forth. Works with low sales are not selected, even if they are renowned. Over time, the hope is that future translations will grow ever closer to the interests of the readership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/|title=A Statement of Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=dharmaebooks.org|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n108 Translations aims to nurture literacy in the Tibetan language, while giving Tibetan readers greater access to world literature. It is a project of Latse and is managed by the 108 Translations Management Team, whose combined skills and experience ensure the highest quality of translation.

Chokyi Lodro]], 14th [[Shamarpa]] (the second-longest recognized tulku lineage in the Karma Kagyu tradition, and who in previous incarnations has held and transmitted the Kagyu lineage between Karmapas), did not recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje and instead proclaimed [[Trinley Thaye Dorje]] ({{bo|w=Mtha'-yas Rdo-rje}}), whom he purportedly identified a few years earlier than the recognition of Orgyen Thrinley Dorje in a dream as the true Karmapa. Shamarpas camp argue that until the reincarnation line of the Shamarpas was forbidden by the government of the Dalai Lama,<ref>see: [[Shamarpa#Controversy]]</ref> the successive Shamarpas were the persons in charge to recognize the Karmapas, whereas the [[Dalai Lama]]s played no role in the recognition.<ref>[https://karmapaissue.wordpress.com/affirmation-of-prof-samuel-geoffrey-concerning-the-historical-role-of-the-dalai-lamas-in-recognizing-the-karmapas/ Prof. Geoffrey Brian Samuel in: \u201cAffirmation of Geoffrey Brian Samuel,\u201d Lama vs. Hope and Ors, CIV-2004404-001363, High Court of New Zealand Auckland Registry, 11 November 2004].</ref>\n\nMany of the previous Karmapas have left a letter stating the details of their rebirth (this is an aspect of the special self-recognizing [[siddhi]] of the Karmapas) to assist in the recognition of their future incarnation, and thus the Shamarpa's recognition through a dream has come under scrutiny.

The [[Government of India]] initially refused to allow these visits without giving a reason.

OTD expressed how the Karma Kamtsang forefathers and disciples maintained and propagated the teachings through study, teaching, and practice; thus, ripened generations of disciples through their wisdom, love, and power. OTD related that this activity of ''ripening'' disciples is the essential heart of the Kagyu history, the majesty and the true weight of the Kagyu teachings. He said that we need to continue to uphold the Lineage by preserving these fine deeds and activities. However, OTD warned, if we instead spend most of our time being biased, factional, and partisan\u2014this is extremely dangerous. If we are partisan and factional, we won't see the faults on our own side, or the qualities on the other. We won't be able to recognize what is good and what is bad. OTD said: \"For that reason, it is a situation where we absolutely must be careful. So this is why I asked His Holiness Thaye Dorje for a meeting this year.\" Furthermore, OTD emphasized that whether reconciliation goes well or not does not depend upon only the two claimants, OTD and TTD. It depends on all the followers and the whole community of the Karma Kamtsang.\n\nIn addition, OTD implored everyone to take as expansive a view as possible, to consider the long-term survival of the Karma Kagyu lineage. He said that those with a very short-term view may think that it was pointless for him to meet with TTD. Likewise, some people might think that OTD, by meeting with TTD, ended up losing\u2014that he was defeated. But he said that victory and defeat is a very short-term worldly way of speaking, and that the long-term danger is that the lineage of the Karma Kagyu will disappear without a trace. Considering this grave danger, OTD said that losing face, victory and defeat, are really not important. In conclusion, OTD requested everyone to please keep this explanation in mind.\n\n=== 2019: Joint Long Life Prayer for Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche\u2019s Reincarnation ===\nOn Oct. 27, 2019 OTD and TTD released a co-authored long life prayer for Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche\u2019s reincarnation.

He has warned that it is a huge mistake to inflate small distinctions into a basis for attachment and hatred, asserting one\u2019s own tradition to be better than another\u2019s. He has said that the reason for any future decline of the Buddha\u2019s Dharma would not come from outside, but from within, from disputes between the holders of his teachings. Therefore, Gyalwang Karmapa has reiterated time and time again that the differences between lineages and factions are minor in terms of view, meditation, and conduct, and has urged everyone to keep a broader non-partisan perspective in mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/tibetan-unity-and-language-are-crucial/|title=Tibetan Unity and Language Are Crucial {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 108 Translations ===\n108 Translations was initiated in 2015 by H.H. Karmapa Orgyen Trinley Dorje. Born of a concept developed during a translators\u2019 workshop held at [http://latse.org Latse] and presided over by Gyalwang Karmapa, the aim of the 108 Translations project is to produce a needed body of reading material that can promote the reinvigoration of Tibetan language. Rather than focussing on translating a few famous works that match the interests of a small group of well-educated readers (which has been the case for translations into Tibetan up to the present), 108 Translations aims to provide a plethora of good and easily accessible reading materials for ''average'' Tibetan readers.\n\nIn his [https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/ Statement of Purpose], Gyalwang Karmapa expressed that we are currently inhabiting a time where there is great concern that the Tibetan language will go extinct. He has said that we have come to the point where we need to take responsibility for the survival of the Tibetan language, and we are in a situation where there is very little reading material that matches the interests of the ordinary Tibetan reader.\n\nThe main criteria for the 108 Translations is that they don't lose the meaning and feeling (or \"flavour\") of the original, the translations must be easy to understand and pronounce in Tibetan, and the selected works need to meet the interests of the readership. For example, translations of famous literary works that have a low readership are examples of unsuccessful translations. 108 Translations must not only consider how well known the works are, they must also examine how they have sold, how many other languages they have been translated into, and so forth. Works with low sales are not selected, even if they are renowned. Over time, the hope is that future translations will grow ever closer to the interests of the readership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/|title=A Statement of Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=dharmaebooks.org|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n108 Translations aims to nurture literacy in the Tibetan language, while giving Tibetan readers greater access to world literature. It is a project of Latse and is managed by the 108 Translations Management Team, whose combined skills and experience ensure the highest quality of translation. This project is also generously supported by [https://dharma-treasure.org Dharma Treasure] and the ebooks will be published on [https://dharmaebooks.org/ dharmaebooks.org] as well [http://latse.org/program/108-translations latse.org/program/108-translations].\n\n== Supporting the Female Buddhist Community ==\nThe Karmapa has, for many years, taken a deep interest in the welfare of the female Buddhist community, as well as being a voice that regularly encourages equal rights and opportunities for women practitioners. He has, in particular, taken the responsibility to restore full ordination for Tibetan nuns.\n\nEach year the Karmapa also hosts the [https://www.facebook.com/AryaKshema/ Arya Kshema] dharma winter gathering where nuns receive special teachings, instructions and gather to debate Buddhist philosophy so as to further increase their opportunities for a traditional education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/portfolio-item/nuns-ordination/|title=The Female Buddhist Community {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\n=== 2013: Preliminary Discussions on Restoring Nuns\u2019 Ordination===\n\nOn September 14, 2013, at the International Buddhist Confederation in New Delhi, Gyalwang Karmapa participated in a discussions with the Full Nun\u2019s Ordination Working Group, joining Co-Chairs Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo, Abbess of Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery in India, and Ven.

Chokyi Lodro]], 14th [[Shamarpa]] (the second-longest recognized tulku lineage in the Karma Kagyu tradition, and who in previous incarnations has held and transmitted the Kagyu lineage between Karmapas), did not recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje and instead proclaimed [[Trinley Thaye Dorje]] ({{bo|w=Mtha'-yas Rdo-rje}}), whom he purportedly identified a few years earlier than the recognition of Orgyen Thrinley Dorje in a dream as the true Karmapa. Shamarpas camp argue that until the reincarnation line of the Shamarpas was forbidden by the government of the Dalai Lama,<ref>see: [[Shamarpa#Controversy]]</ref> the successive Shamarpas were the persons in charge to recognize the Karmapas, whereas the [[Dalai Lama]]s played no role in the recognition.<ref>[https://karmapaissue.wordpress.com/affirmation-of-prof-samuel-geoffrey-concerning-the-historical-role-of-the-dalai-lamas-in-recognizing-the-karmapas/ Prof. Geoffrey Brian Samuel in: \u201cAffirmation of Geoffrey Brian Samuel,\u201d Lama vs. Hope and Ors, CIV-2004404-001363, High Court of New Zealand Auckland Registry, 11 November 2004].</ref>\n\nMany of the previous Karmapas have left a letter stating the details of their rebirth (this is an aspect of the special self-recognizing [[siddhi]] of the Karmapas) to assist in the recognition of their future incarnation, and thus the Shamarpa's recognition through a dream has come under scrutiny. On the other side Shamarpa questioned the authenticity of the \"prophecy letter\" which the 16th Karmapa allegedly had written and asked Situ Rinpoche for a forensic test of the letter, which Situ Rinpoche refused.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://karmapaissue.wordpress.com/2015/03/10/the-letter-of-prediction/ |title = The \"letter of prediction\"|date = 10 March 2015}}</ref> Ogyen Trinley Dorje is supported by the majority of the Kagyu hierarchy,<ref>{{cite news |title=Tibetan Lama Faces Scrutiny and Suspicion in India |first=Jim |last=Yardley |authorlink=Jim Yardley |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/asia/08tibet.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2011-02-08 |quote=After the death of the previous Karmapa, a bitter feud broke out between the high lamas charged with identifying his successor: at least two other people now claim to be the Karmapa, though a majority of Tibetans, including the Dalai Lama, recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wM5g7lzg?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/asia/08tibet.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all |archivedate=2011-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> including two lamas who have played a role in finding previous Karmapas: [[Tai Situpa]] and [[Goshir Gyaltsab]].

{"title_page": "Hillary Clinton email controversy", "text_new": "An extensive Russian disinformation campaign to sabotage Hillary and help her opponent cost her the presidential election despite winning the popular vote\n\nSome experts, officials, and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] contended that Clinton's use of a private [[Message transfer agent|messaging system]] and a private server violated federal law, specifically 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1924, regarding the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials, as well as State Department protocols and procedures, and regulations governing [[recordkeeping]]. Clinton responded that her use complied with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts. News reports by NBC and CNN indicated that the emails discussed \"innocuous\" matters already available in the public domain. For example, the [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|CIA drone program]] has been widely discussed in the public domain \n\nThe controversy was a major point of discussion and contention during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee. In May, the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|State Department's Office of the Inspector General]] released a report about the State Department's email practices, including Clinton's. In July, FBI director [[James Comey]] announced that the FBI investigation had concluded that Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" but recommended that no charges be filed. Clinton's opponent, then presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], used the nickname \"Crooked Hillary\" to criticize Clinton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/05/trumps-nicknames-for-rivals-from-rocket-man-to-pocahontas.html|title=Trump's nicknames for rivals, from 'Rocket Man' to 'Pocahontas'|first=Kaitlyn|last=Schallhorn|date=April 17, 2018|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=April 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn October 28, 2016, days before the election, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had started looking into newly discovered emails.

An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] examination of Clinton's server found over 100 emails containing classified information, including 65 emails deemed \"Secret\" and 22 deemed \"Top Secret\". An additional 2,093 emails not marked classified were retroactively classified by the State Department. \n\nSome experts, officials, and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] contended that Clinton's use of a private [[Message transfer agent|messaging system]] and a private server violated federal law, specifically 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1924, regarding the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials, as well as State Department protocols and procedures, and regulations governing [[recordkeeping]]. Clinton responded that her use complied with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts. News reports by NBC and CNN indicated that the emails discussed \"innocuous\" matters already available in the public domain. For example, the [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|CIA drone program]] has been widely discussed in the public domain since the early 2000s; however, the very existence of the program is technically classified, so sharing a newspaper article that mentions it would constitute a security breach according to the CIA.<ref>\"Secrecy defines Obama\u2019s drone war,\" ''Washington Post'', December 19, 2011: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secrecy-defines-obamas-drone-war/2011/10/28/gIQAPKNR5O_story.html</ref><ref>\"DoD Warns Employees of Classified Info in Public Domain,\" Federation of American Scientists, June 11, 2013: https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/06/dod-classified/</ref>  \n\nThe controversy was a major point of discussion and contention during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee. In May, the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|State Department's Office of the Inspector General]] released a report about the State Department's email practices, including Clinton's. In July, FBI director [[James Comey]] announced that the FBI investigation had concluded that Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" but recommended that no charges be filed.
