It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to August 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], the last other major candidate in the Democratic primary, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden and Trump are respectively the oldest and second-oldest major party presumptive nominees in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if he is elected and inaugurated, Biden will also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

W. Bush]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] and [[Al Gore]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] elections).\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns. Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\n==Nominations==\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{main|2020 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n====Primaries====\nIn election cycles with incumbent presidents running for re-election, the race for their party nomination are usually ''pro-forma'', with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor.<ref name=\"B1TfP\" /><ref name=\"politico20190506\" /> The 2020 election is no exception; with Donald Trump formally seeking a second term,<ref name=\"DFAz3\" /><ref name=\"VkToz\" /> the official Republican apparatus, both state and national, have coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge.<ref name=\"ct7mA\" /><ref name=\"Rbspl\" /> On January 25, 2019, the [[Republican National Committee]] unofficially endorsed Trump.<ref name=\"u5OTG\" />\n\nSeveral Republican state committees have scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses.<ref name=\"politico20190906\" /> They have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization that conflicted with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media. They don't know what the truth is and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 they don't care.\"<ref name=\"iWwLJ\" />\n\nOn September 8, 2019, former South Carolina governor and representative [[Mark Sanford]] officially announced that he would be another Republican primary challenger to Trump.<ref name=\"NYTimesSanford\" /> He dropped out of the race 65 days later on November 12, 2019, after failing to gain support in Republican circles.<ref name=\"JE5vC\" />\n\nStill, [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Donald Trump's re-election campaign]] has essentially been ongoing since his victory in 2016, leading pundits to describe his tactic of holding rallies continuously throughout his presidency as a \"never-ending campaign\".<ref name=\"kn3IR\" /> On January 20, 2017, at 5:11&nbsp;p.m., he submitted a letter as a substitute of FEC Form 2, by which he reached the legal threshold for filing, in compliance with the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]].<ref name=\"0ergM\" /> Trump has run an active campaign during the primary season, even holding rallies in the February primary states, including South Carolina and Nevada where those Republican races were canceled.<ref name=\"vckt4\" /><ref name=\"y1IrS\" />\n\nThrough Super Tuesday, March 3, Trump won every race. Including those states who have canceled their races and have awarded their delegates to him, Trump through Super Tuesday won an estimated 1,023 of the 1,276 required to officially become the presumptive Republican Party nominee.<ref name=\"RifKC\" /> After the March 10 primaries, he was a mere 11 delegates shy of clinching, which he did the following week. As of March 21, he has received 11,446,331 popular votes. \n\nOn March 17, 2020, having won enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the convention, Trump became the presumptive nominee.<ref name=\"u9rZ3\" /> Weld suspended his campaign the next day.<ref name=\"HCjk9\" />\n\n====Presumptive nominee==== \n{{Donald Trump series |expanded=Campaigns}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n\n| colspan=\"28\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |\n\n[[File:Republican Disc.png|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''Presumptive 2020 Republican Party ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Donald Trump}}\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Mike Pence}}\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#ffd0d7;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:Official Portrait of President Donald Trump.jpg|center|200x200px|border]]<!-- DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENSUS.

These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates. [[Pete Buttigieg]] narrowly defeated [[Bernie Sanders]] in Iowa, then Sanders edged Buttigieg in the February 11 [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Following [[Michael Bennet]], [[Deval Patrick]], and [[Andrew Yang]] dropping out, Sanders won the [[2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] on February 22. [[Joe Biden]] then won the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary|South Carolina primary]], causing Buttigieg, [[Amy Klobuchar]], and [[Tom Steyer]] to abandon their campaigns (Buttigieg and Klobuchar then immediately endorsed Biden). After [[Super Tuesday]], March 3, [[Michael Bloomberg]] and [[Elizabeth Warren]] quit the race, leaving three candidates left: Biden and Sanders, the main contenders, and [[Tulsi Gabbard]], who remained in the race despite facing nigh-on insurmountable odds.<ref name=\"cw3Ne\" /> Gabbard then dropped out and endorsed Biden after the March 17 [[2020 Arizona Democratic primary|Arizona]], [[2020 Florida Democratic primary|Florida]], and [[2020 Illinois Democratic primary|Illinois]] races.<ref name=\"2vZj6\" /> On April 8, 2020, Sanders dropped out, leaving Biden as the only major candidate remaining, and the presumptive nominee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/08/biden-sanders-2016-2020-176169|title=Biden moves quickly to exorcise \u2018the ghosts of 2016\u2019|website=Politico|last1=Caputo|first1=Marc|date=April 8, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Presumptive nominee==== \n{{Joe Biden series}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"30\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |[[File:U.S. Democratic Party logo (transparent).svg|65px|center|link=Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party (United States)]]<big>'''Presumptive 2020 Democratic Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Joe Biden}}\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}};\"|{{colored link|white|2020 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection|TBD}}\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#c8ebff;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-<--Do not add a generic image here, that would be forbidden under WP:IPH-->\n|[[File:Joe Biden official portrait 2013 cropped.jpg|alt=|center|200x200px]]<!-- DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENSUS.

The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to August 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics.

The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden and Trump are respectively the oldest and second-oldest major party presumptive nominees in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if he is elected and inaugurated, Biden will also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

W. Bush]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] and [[Al Gore]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] elections).\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].

Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization that conflicted with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media. They don't know what the truth is and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 they don't care.\"<ref name=\"iWwLJ\" />\n\nOn September 8, 2019, former South Carolina governor and representative [[Mark Sanford]] officially announced that he would be another Republican primary challenger to Trump.<ref name=\"NYTimesSanford\" /> He dropped out of the race 65 days later on November 12, 2019, after failing to gain support in Republican circles.<ref name=\"JE5vC\" />\n\nStill, [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Donald Trump's re-election campaign]] has essentially been ongoing since his victory in 2016, leading pundits to describe his tactic of holding rallies continuously throughout his presidency as a \"never-ending campaign\".<ref name=\"kn3IR\" /> On January 20, 2017, at 5:11&nbsp;p.m., he submitted a letter as a substitute of FEC Form 2, by which he reached the legal threshold for filing, in compliance with the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]].<ref name=\"0ergM\" /> Trump has run an active campaign during the primary season, even holding rallies in the February primary states, including South Carolina and Nevada where those Republican races were canceled.<ref name=\"vckt4\" /><ref name=\"y1IrS\" />\n\nThrough Super Tuesday, March 3, Trump won every race. Including those states who have canceled their races and have awarded their delegates to him, Trump through Super Tuesday won an estimated 1,023 of the 1,276 required to officially become the presumptive Republican Party nominee.<ref name=\"RifKC\" /> After the March 10 primaries, he was a mere 11 delegates shy of clinching, which he did the following week.

This would require a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the party's nomination.

In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates.

According to the writer Diana Postlethwaite, Harriet's relationship with her mother was strained and lacking affection, which contributed to views expressed in her later writing.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/> Martineau claimed her mother abandoned her to a [[wet nurse]].\n\nHer ideas on domesticity and the \"natural faculty for housewifery\", as described in her book ''Household Education'' (1848),<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/> stemmed from her lack of nurture growing up. Although their relationship was better in adulthood, Harriet saw her mother as the antithesis of the warm and nurturing qualities which she knew to be necessary for girls at an early age. Her mother urged all her children to be well read, but at the same time opposed female pedantics \"with a sharp eye for feminine propriety and good manners. Her daughters could never be seen in public with a pen in their hand\". Despite  this conservative  approach to  raising  girls,  Martineau  was  not  the only  academically  successful  daughter in the family;  her  sister  Rachel  ran  her  own  [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]  Academy  with  artist [[Bonham  Carter  family|Hilary  Bonham  Carter]]  as  one  of  her  students.<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Malley |first1=I. |title=Florence Nightingale, 1820-1856 : a study of her life down to the end of the Crimean war |url=https://archive.org/stream/florencenighting00omal/florencenighting00omal_djvu.txt |accessdate=10 September 2019 |quote=Hilary was at a school kept by Miss Rachael Martineau, sister of Harriet.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cromwell |first1=J. |title=Florence Nightingale - Feminist |date=15 March 2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7SEiqxGoxmMC&pg=PA37&dq=hilary+bonham+carter++++academy#v=onepage |publisher=McFarland, 25 Feb 2013 |accessdate=10 September 2019 |page=37 |isbn=9780786470921 |quote=....Unitarian  Academy....}}</ref>   Martineau's mother strictly enforced proper feminine behaviour, pushing her daughter to \"hold a sewing needle\" as well as the (hidden) pen.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/>\n\nMartineau began losing her senses of taste and smell at a young age, becoming increasingly [[deaf]] and having to use an [[ear trumpet]]. It was the beginning of many health problems in her life. In 1821 she began to write anonymously for the ''[[Monthly Repository]]'', a Unitarian periodical, and in 1823 she published ''Devotional Exercises and Addresses, Prayers and Hymns''.\n\nIn 1829, the family's textile business failed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://armitt.com/armitt_website/harriet-martineau-armitt-museum-and-library-cumbri/|title=Harriet Martineau at The Armitt Museum and Library Cumbria|website=ARMITT MUSEUM & LIBRARY|accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref> Martineau, then 27 years old, stepped out of the traditional roles of feminine propriety to earn a living for her family.

Her regular work with the ''Repository'' helped establish her as a reliable and popular freelance writer.\n\nIn Martineau's ''Autobiography'', she reflects on her success as a writer and her father's business failure, which she describes as \"one of the best things that ever happened to us\".  She described how she could then \"truly live instead of vegetate\".<ref>Martineau, Harriet.

''Illustrations'' was published in February 1832 in an edition of just 1500 copies, since the publisher assumed it would not sell well.  Yet it very quickly became highly successful, and would steadily out-sell the work of [[Charles Dickens]]. ''Illustrations'' was her first work to receive widespread acclaim, and its success served to spread the free-market ideas of Adam Smith and others throughout the [[British Empire]]. Martineau then agreed to compose a series of similar monthly stories over a period of two years, the work being hastened by having her brother James also work on the series with her.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/>\n\nThe subsequent works offered fictional tutorials on a range of political economists such as [[James Mill]], [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] and [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]], the latter especially forming her view of rent law.  Martineau relied on [[Malthus]] to form her view of the tendency of human population to exceed its means of subsistence.  However, in stories such as \"Weal and Woe in Garvelock\", she promoted the idea of [[population control]] through what Malthus referred to as \"voluntary checks\" such as [[Sexual abstinence#History|voluntary chastity]] and delayed marriages.\n\n==London and the United States==\nIn the early 19th century, most social institutions and norms were strongly shaped by gender, or the perception of what was appropriate for men versus for women. Writing was no exception; non-fiction works about social, economic and political issues were dominated by men, while limited areas, such as romance fiction, and topics dealing with domesticity were considered to be appropriate for women authors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Logan|first=Deborah Anne|title=The Hour and the Woman: Harriet Martineau's Somewhat Remarkable Life|year=2002|publisher=Northern Illinois University Press|location=Dekalb, Illinois|isbn=0-87580-297-4}}</ref> Despite these gendered expectations in the literary world, Martineau strongly expressed her opinions on a variety of topics.\n\nMartineau's frequent publication in the Repository acquainted her with editor Rev. [[William Johnson Fox]] (not William Darwin Fox, see disambiguation). First coming to London around 1830, she joined Fox's social circle of prominent thinkers which also introduced her to [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin]], older brother to Charles Darwin.\n\nIn November 1832 Martineau moved to London.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://martineausociety.co.uk/the-martineaus/harriet-martineau/|title=Harriet Martineau (1802-76) \u2013 Martineau Society|accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref> Among her acquaintances were: [[Henry Hallam]], [[Harriet Taylor]], [[Alexander Maconochie (penal reformer)|Alexander Maconochie]], [[Henry Hart Milman]], [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Monckton Milnes]], [[Sydney Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], [[Sarah Austin (translator)|Sarah Austin]], and [[Charles Lyell]], as well as [[Jane Welsh Carlyle]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. She met [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]], [[George Eliot]] and [[Charles Dickens]] later on in her literary career.\n\nUntil 1834 Martineau was occupied with her brother James on the [[political economy]] series, as well as a supplemental series of ''Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated and Illustrations of Taxation'' which was intended to directly influence government policy. About the same time, she published four stories expressing support of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[Poor Law]] reforms. These tales (direct, lucid, written without any appearance of effort, and yet practically effective) display the characteristics of their author's style. [[Tory]] paternalists reacted by calling her a [[Malthusian]] \"who deprecates charity and provision for the poor\", while [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] opposed her to the same degree.

He found him spending his days \"driving out Miss Martineau\", who had returned from her trip to the United States. Charles wrote to his sister, \n<blockquote>Our only protection from so admirable a sister-in-law is in her working him too hard.\" He commented, \"She already takes him to task about his idleness \u2014 She is going some day to explain to him her notions about marriage \u2014 Perfect equality of rights is part of her doctrine.

Charles noted that his father was upset by a piece in the ''Westminster Review'' calling for the radicals to break with the Whigs and give working men the vote \"before he knew it was not [Martineau's], and wasted a good deal of indignation, and even now can hardly believe it is not hers\".<ref name=\"Desmond 1991 205\">{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=205}}</ref> In early December 1836 Charles Darwin called on Martineau and may have discussed the social and natural worlds she was writing about in her book ''Society in America'', including the \"grandeur and beauty\" of the \"process of world making\" she had seen at [[Niagara Falls]].<ref name=\"Desmond 1991 205\"/> He remarked in a letter, <blockquote>She was very agreeable and managed to talk on a most wonderful number of subjects, considering the limited time.

She portrayed a failed love affair between a physician and his sister-in-law. It was considered her most successful novel.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/> She also wrote ''The Hour and the Man: An Historical Romance'' (1839), a three-volume novel about the Haitian slave leader [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]], who contributed to the island nation's gaining independence in 1804.\n\n==Newcastle and Tynemouth==\n[[File:Anne Whitney, Harriet Martineau, 1882, Davis Museum, Wellesley.tif|thumb|[[Anne Whitney]], ''Harriet Martineau'', 1882, [[Davis Museum at Wellesley College|Davis Museum]], [[Wellesley College]]]]\nIn 1839, during a visit to [[Continental Europe]], Martineau was diagnosed with a uterine tumour.  She several times visited her brother-in-law, [[Thomas Michael Greenhow]], who was a celebrated doctor in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to try to alleviate her symptoms.  On the last occasion she stayed for six months in the Greenhow family house at 28 Eldon Square. Immobile and confined to a couch, she was cared for by her mother until purchasing a house and hiring a nurse to aid her.\n\nShe next moved downriver to [[Tynemouth]], where she stayed at Mrs Halliday's boarding-house, 57 Front Street, for nearly five years from 16 March 1840. The establishment is still open as a guest house today, now named the \"Martineau Guest House\" in her honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Martineau Guest House|url=http://www.martineau-house.co.uk/|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe critic Diana Postlethwaite wrote of this period for Martineau: <blockquote>Being homebound is a major part of the process of becoming feminine. In this interior setting she (Martineau) is taught the home arts of working, serving, and cleaning, as well as the rehearsals for the role of mothering. She sees her mother... doing these things. They define femininity for her.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/></blockquote>Her illness caused her to literally enact the social constraints of women during this time.\n\nMartineau wrote a number of books during her illness, and a historical plaque marks this house. In 1841 she published a series of four novels for children, ''The Playfellow'', comprising ''The Settlers at Home'', ''The Peasant and the Prince'', ''Feats on the Fiord'', and ''The Crofton Boys''. In 1844 she published ''Life in the Sickroom: Essays by an Invalid,'' an autobiographical reflection on invalidism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|year=1844|title=Life in the Sickroom: Essays by an Invalid|publisher=Edward Moxon|place=London|edition=2nd|page=|url=https://archive.org/stream/lifeinsickroome01martgoog#page/n8/mode/2up|accessdate=14 June 2016|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> She wrote ''Household Education'' (1848), the handbook on the \"proper\" way to raise and educate children. Lastly, she began working on her autobiography.  Completed much later, it included some hundred pages on this period. Notable visitors included Richard Cobden and Thomas and Jane Carlyle.\n\n''Life in the Sickroom'' is considered to be one of Martineau's most under-rated works. It upset evangelical readers as they \"thought it dangerous in 'its supposition of self-reliance'\".<ref name=\"Winter 1995 597\u2013616\">{{cite journal|authorlink1=Alison Winter|last=Winter|first=Alison|title=Harriet Martineau and the Reform of the Invalid in Victorian England|journal=The Historical Journal|date=September 1995|volume=38|issue=3|pages=597\u2013616|jstor=264004|doi=10.1017/s0018246x00019993}}</ref> This series of essays embraced traditional womanhood. Martineau dedicated it to [[Elizabeth Barrett]], as it was \"an outpouring of feeling to an idealized female alter ego, both professional writer and professional invalid- and utterly unlike the women in her own family\". Written during a kind of public break from her mother, this book was Martineau's proclamation of independence.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Martineau turned the traditional patient\u2013doctor relationship on its head by asserting control over her space even in sickness. The sickroom was her space. ''Life in the Sickroom'' explained how to regain control even in illness. Alarmed that a woman was suggesting such a position in the power dynamic, critics suggested that, as she was an invalid, her mind must also be sick and the work was not to be taken seriously. ''British and Foreign Medical Review'' dismissed Martineau's piece on the same basis as the critics: an ill person cannot write a healthy work. They thought it was unheard of for a woman to suggest being in a position of control, especially in sickness. Instead, the ''Review'' recommended that patients follow \"unconditional submission\" to the advice of doctors.<ref name=\"Winter 1995 597\u2013616\"/> They disagreed with the idea that Martineau might hold any sort of \"authority to Britain's invalids\".<ref name=\"Winter 1995 597\u2013616\"/>\n\nExpecting to remain an invalid for the rest of her life, Martineau delighted in the new freedom of views using her [[telescope]]. Across the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] was the sandy beach \u2033where there are frequent wrecks\u2014too interesting to an invalid... and above the rocks, a spreading heath, where I watch troops of boys flying their kites; lovers and friends taking their breezy walks on Sundays...\"<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/> She expressed a lyrical view of Tynemouth:\n\n<blockquote>When I look forth in the morning, the whole land may be sheeted with glittering snow, while the myrtle-green sea swells and tumbles... there is none of the deadness of winter in the landscape; no leafless trees, no locking up with ice; and the air comes in through my open upper sash brisk, but sun-warmed. The robins twitter and hop in my flower-boxes... And at night, what a heaven! What an expanse of stars above, appearing more steadfast, the more the Northern Lights dart and quiver!<ref>''Life in the Sick-room: Essays by an Invalid'' by Harriet Martineau (2nd ed., 1844), [https://archive.org/stream/lifeinsickroome01martgoog#page/n72/mode/2up/ pp. 50-51].</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring her illness, she for a second time declined a pension on the [[civil list]], fearing to compromise her political independence. After publication of her letter on the subject, some of her friends raised a small [[Life annuity|annuity]] for her soon after.\n\nIn 1844 Martineau underwent a course of [[mesmerism]], returning to health after a few months. There was national interest in mesmerism at this time. Also known as 'animal magnetism', it can be defined as a \"loosely grouped set of practices in which one person influenced another through a variety of personal actions, or through the direct influence of one mind on another mind. Mesmerism was designed to make invisible forces augment the mental powers of the mesmeric object.\"<ref name=\"Winter 1995 597\u2013616\"/> She eventually published an account of her case in sixteen ''Letters on Mesmerism'', which caused much discussion.

She believed the ultimate goal to be philosophic [[atheism]], but did not explicitly say so in the book.  She described ancient tombs, \"the black pall of oblivion\" set against the [[Paschal cycle|paschal]] \"puppet show\" in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], and noted that Christian beliefs in reward and punishment were based on and similar to [[Paganism|heathen]] [[superstition]]s. Describing an [[ancient Egypt]]ian tomb, she wrote, \"How like ours were his life and death!... Compare him with a retired naval officer made country gentleman in our day, and in how much less do they differ than agree!\" The book's \"[[infidel]] tendency\" was too much for the publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], who rejected it. Martineau's biographer, Florence Fenwick Miller, wrote that \"all her best moral and intellectual faculties were exerted, and their action becomes visible, at one page or another\" of this work.<ref>Fenwick 1884, p. 109</ref>\n\nMartineau wrote ''[[Household Education]]'' in 1848, lamenting the state of women's education. She believed women had a natural inclination to motherhood and believed domestic work went hand in hand with academia for a proper, well-rounded education. She stated, \"I go further than most persons... in desiring thorough practice in domestic occupations, from an early age, for young girls\".<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/> She proposed that freedom and rationality, rather than command and obedience, are the most effectual instruments of education.\n\nHer interest in schemes of instruction led her to start a series of lectures, addressed at first to the school children of Ambleside, but afterward extended to their parents at the request of the adults. The subjects were sanitary principles and practice, the [[History of England|histories of England]] and [[History of North America|North America]], and the scenes of her Eastern travels. At the request of the publisher [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]], in 1849 she wrote ''The History of the Thirty Years' Peace, 1816\u20131846'', an excellent popular history from the point of view of a \"philosophical Radical\". Martineau spanned a wide variety of subject matter in her writing and did so with more assertiveness than was expected of women at the time. She has been described as having an \"essentially masculine nature\".<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/> It was commonly thought that a \"progressive\" woman, in being progressive, was improperly emulating the qualities of a man.\n\nMartineau's work included a widely used guide book to the [[Lake District]], ''A Complete Guide to the English Lakes'', published in 1855 and in its 4th edition by 1876.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book|title=A Complete Guide to the English Lakes|last=Martineau|first=Harriet|url=https://archive.org/stream/completeguidetoe1855mart#page/n7/mode/2up|date=nd|location=Windermere|publisher=John Garnett|via=Archive.org}}</ref><ref>reviewed in the ''Westmorland Gazette'', Saturday 8 July 1871, p.&nbsp;3, column 1</ref> This served as the definitive guidebook for the area for 25 years, effectively replacing the earlier [[Guide to the Lakes|guide]] by [[William Wordsworth]], and continued in common usage until the publication of [[M. J. B. Baddeley|Baddeley's]]  ''Thorough Guide to the English Lake District'' in 1880.\n\n[[File:Harriet Martineau sociologist.jpg|thumb|Martineau in her later years, painted by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]]]]\nMartineau edited a volume of ''Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development'', published in March 1851. Its epistolary form is based on correspondence between her and the self-styled scientist [[Henry G. Atkinson]].  She expounded the doctrine of philosophical atheism, which she thought the tendency of human belief . She did not deny a [[Cosmological argument|first cause]] but declared it [[Agnosticism|unknowable]].  She and Atkinson thought they affirmed man's [[moral obligation]]. Atkinson was a zealous exponent of mesmerism. The prominence given to the topics of mesmerism and [[clairvoyance]] heightened the general disapproval of the book.  Literary London was outraged by its mesmeric [[evolutionism|evolutionary]] atheism, and the book caused a lasting division between Martineau, her beloved brother, James who had become a Unitarian cleric, and some of her friends.\n\nFrom 1852 to 1866, she contributed regularly to the ''[[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]'', writing sometimes six leaders a week. She wrote over 1600 articles for the paper in total.<ref name=\"spartacus-educational.com\"/>  It also published her ''Letters from Ireland'', written during a visit to that country in the summer of 1852.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersofcharlot0001bron|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/lettersofcharlot0001bron/page/120 120]|quote=Letters from ireland 1852.|title=The Letters of Charlotte Bront\u00eb: 1852-1855|first=Charlotte|last=Bront\u00eb|date=7 August 1995|publisher=Clarendon|accessdate=7 August 2019|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> For many years she was a contributor to the ''[[Westminster Review]]''; in 1854 she was among financial supporters who prevented its closing down.\n\nMartineau believed she was psychosomatic; this medical belief of the times related the uterus to emotions and hysteria. She had symptoms of hysteria in her loss of taste and smell.  Her partial deafness throughout life may have contributed to her problems. Various people, including the maid, her brother,<ref name=\"Winter 1995 597\u2013616\"/> and Spencer T. Hall (a notable mesmerist) performed mesmerism on her.  Some historians attribute her apparent recovery from symptoms to a shift in the positioning of her tumor so that it no longer obstructed other organs. As the physical improvements were the first signs of healing she had in five years and happened at the same time of her first mesmeric treatment, Martineau confidentially credited mesmerism with her \"cure\".<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/>\n\nShe continued her political activism during the late 1850s and 1860s. She supported the Married Women's Property Bill and in 1856 signed a petition for it organised by [[Barbara Bodichon|Barbara Bodichon.]]  She also pushed for licensed prostitution and laws that addressed the customers rather than the women.  She supported women's [[suffrage]]<ref name=\"auto1\"/> and signed Bodichon's petition in its favour in 1866.\n\nIn the early part of 1855, Martineau was suffering from [[heart disease]]. She began to write her autobiography, as she expected her life to end. Completing the book rapidly in three months,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> she postponed its publication until after her death, and lived another two decades.  It was published posthumously in 1877.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/>\n\nWhen Darwin's book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was published in 1859, his brother Erasmus sent a copy to his old flame Harriet Martineau.  At age 58, she was still reviewing from her home in the Lake District. From her \"snow landscape\", Martineau sent her thanks, adding that she had previously praised\n<blockquote>the quality & conduct of your brother's mind, but it is an unspeakable satisfaction to see here the full manifestation of its earnestness & simplicity, its sagacity, its industry, & the patient power by which it has collected such a mass of facts, to transmute them by such sagacious treatment into such portentous knowledge. I should much like to know how large a proportion of our scientific men believe he has found a sound road.</blockquote>Martineau supported Darwin's theory because it was not based in theology. Martineau strove for secularism stating, \"In the present state of the religious world, Secularism ought to flourish. What an amount of sin and woe might and would then be extinguished.\"<ref name=\"bell\" /> She wrote to her fellow [[Thomas Malthus|Malthusian]] (and atheist) [[George Holyoake]] enthusing, \"What a book it is! \u2013 overthrowing (if true) revealed Religion on the one hand, & Natural (as far as Final Causes & Design are concerned) on the other. The range & mass of knowledge take away one's breath.\" To Fanny Wedgwood (the wife of [[Hensleigh Wedgwood]]) she wrote,\n<blockquote>I rather regret that C.D. went out of his way two or three times to speak of \"The [[Creator God|Creator]]\" in the popular sense of the First Cause.... His subject is the \"Origin of Species\" & not the origin of Organisation; & it seems a needless mischief to have opened the latter speculation at all \u2013 There now! I have delivered my mind.</blockquote>\n\n==Economics and social sciences==\nHarriet Martineau propounds political economic theories in ''Illustrations of Political Economy''. She is seen as a frontrunner who merges fiction and economy in a time period when \"fiction claimed authority over emotional knowledge, while economics claimed authority over empirical knowledge\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Making a Social Body: British Cultural Formation 1830\u20131864.|last=Poovey|first=Mary|publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=132\u201333}}</ref> Moreover, Martineau's text sets the stage for women to enter into economics. For example, Dalley Lana explains that \"by bringing the topic of domestic economy to bear on political economy, Martineau places women more centrally within economic theory and practice. In this context, women \u2013 as readers of the ''Illustrations'' and as characters with the tales \u2013 are not only rendered a part of larger-scale economics but also (because of their participation) encourage to learn the principles of political economy.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.branchcollective.org/?ps_articles=lana-l-dalley-on-martineaus-illustrations-of-political-economy-1832-34|title=On Martineau's Illustrations of Political Economy, 1832\u201334|date=|accessdate=30 November 2015|website=BRANCH: Britain, Representation|publisher=|last=Dalley|first=Lana L.}}</ref>\n\nAs early as 1831, Martineau wrote on the subject \"Political Economy\" (as the field of economics was then known). Her goal was to popularise and illustrate the principles of ''[[laissez faire]]'' capitalism, though she made no claim to original theorising.\n\nMartineau's reflections on ''Society in America'', published in 1837, are prime examples of her sociological methods. Her ideas in this field were set out in her 1838 book ''[[How to Observe Morals and Manners]]''. She believed that some very general social laws influence the life of any society, including the principle of progress, the emergence of science as the most advanced product of human intellectual endeavour, and the significance of population dynamics and the natural physical environment.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[Auguste Comte]] coined the name sociology and published a rambling exposition under the title of ''Cours de Philosophie Positive'' in 1839.  Martineau undertook a translation that was published in two volumes in 1853 as ''The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte (freely translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau)''. It was a remarkable achievement, and a successful one; Comte recommended her volumes to his students instead of his own. Some writers regard Martineau as the first female sociologist. Her introduction of Comte to the English-speaking world and the elements of sociological perspective in her original writings support her credit as a sociologist.<ref name=\"Sociology\">{{cite book|author1=Anthony Giddens|author2=Simon Griffiths|title=Sociology|url=https://archive.org/details/sociology0005gidd|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Polity|page=[https://archive.org/details/sociology0005gidd/page/20 20]}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:The lower section of the Reformers memorial, Kensal Green Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Harriet Martineau's name on the lower section of the Reformers memorial, Kensal Green Cemetery]]\nHarriet Martineau died of bronchitis<ref name=\"spartacus-educational.com\"/> at \"The Knoll\" on 27 June 1876.

With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she could see clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression to what she had to say. In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1877 her autobiography was published. It was rare for a woman to publish such a work, let alone one secular in nature. Her book was regarded as dispassionate, \"philosophic to the core\" in its perceived masculinity, and a work of [[necessitarianism]]. She deeply explored childhood experiences and memories, expressing feelings of having been deprived of her mother's affection, as well as strong devotion to her brother [[James Martineau]], a theologian.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/>\n\nAnthony Giddens and Simon Griffiths argue that Martineau is a neglected founder of sociology and that she remains important today. She taught that study of the society must include all its aspects, including key political, religious and social institutions, and she insisted on the need to include the lives of women.  She was the first sociologist to study such issues as marriage, children, religious life, and race relations.  Finally, she called on sociologists to do more than just observe, but also work to benefit the society.<ref name=\"Sociology\"/>\n\nIn February 2014, it was reported that London's [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] held several portraits of Harriet, whose great nephew, [[Lupton family|Francis Martineau Lupton]], was the great\u2013great\u2013grandfather of [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], the gallery's patron.<ref>{{cite web|last=Furness|first=Hannah|title=Duchess of Cambridge visits National Portrait Gallery, home to little-known Middleton family paintings.|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/10631996/Duchess-of-Cambridge-visits-National-Portrait-Gallery-home-of-little-known-Middleton-family-paintings.html|date=11 February 2014|page=3|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref> Harriet was close to her niece [[Frances Lupton]], who worked to open up [[Female education#Modern period|educational opportunities for women]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Edited by Elisabeth Sanders Arbuckle|first1=Harriet Martineau|title=Harriet Martineau's Letters to Fanny Wedgwood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yR2rAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA154|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=150|date=1 January 1983|isbn=9780804711463|accessdate=15 May 2015|quote=(May 1857) My (H.

Along with her needlework, she began selling her articles to the ''Monthly Repository'', earning accolades, including three essay prizes from the [[Unitarian Association]]. Her regular work with the ''Repository'' helped establish her as a reliable and popular freelance writer.\n\nIn Martineau's ''Autobiography'', she reflects on her success as a writer and her father's business failure, which she describes as \"one of the best things that ever happened to us\".  She described how she could then \"truly live instead of vegetate\".<ref>Martineau, Harriet. From \"Autobiography\" ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature Eighth Edition Volume E: The Victorian Age''. Ed. Stephen Greenblatt. New York: Norton, 2006. 1589\u201392.</ref> Her reflection emphasizes her experience with financial responsibility in her life while she writes \"[her] fusion of literary and economic narratives\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHer first commissioned book, ''[[Illustrations of Political Economy]]'',<ref>Full text at [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1873&Itemid=27 The Online Library of Liberty]</ref> was a fictional tutorial intended to help the general public understand the ideas of [[Adam Smith]]. ''Illustrations'' was published in February 1832 in an edition of just 1500 copies, since the publisher assumed it would not sell well.  Yet it very quickly became highly successful, and would steadily out-sell the work of [[Charles Dickens]]. ''Illustrations'' was her first work to receive widespread acclaim, and its success served to spread the free-market ideas of Adam Smith and others throughout the [[British Empire]]. Martineau then agreed to compose a series of similar monthly stories over a period of two years, the work being hastened by having her brother James also work on the series with her.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/>\n\nThe subsequent works offered fictional tutorials on a range of political economists such as [[James Mill]], [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] and [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]], the latter especially forming her view of rent law.  Martineau relied on [[Malthus]] to form her view of the tendency of human population to exceed its means of subsistence.  However, in stories such as \"Weal and Woe in Garvelock\", she promoted the idea of [[population control]] through what Malthus referred to as \"voluntary checks\" such as [[Sexual abstinence#History|voluntary chastity]] and delayed marriages.\n\n==London and the United States==\nIn the early 19th century, most social institutions and norms were strongly shaped by gender, or the perception of what was appropriate for men versus for women. Writing was no exception; non-fiction works about social, economic and political issues were dominated by men, while limited areas, such as romance fiction, and topics dealing with domesticity were considered to be appropriate for women authors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Logan|first=Deborah Anne|title=The Hour and the Woman: Harriet Martineau's Somewhat Remarkable Life|year=2002|publisher=Northern Illinois University Press|location=Dekalb, Illinois|isbn=0-87580-297-4}}</ref> Despite these gendered expectations in the literary world, Martineau strongly expressed her opinions on a variety of topics.\n\nMartineau's frequent publication in the Repository acquainted her with editor Rev. [[William Johnson Fox]] (not William Darwin Fox, see disambiguation). First coming to London around 1830, she joined Fox's social circle of prominent thinkers which also introduced her to [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin]], older brother to Charles Darwin.\n\nIn November 1832 Martineau moved to London.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://martineausociety.co.uk/the-martineaus/harriet-martineau/|title=Harriet Martineau (1802-76) \u2013 Martineau Society|accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref> Among her acquaintances were: [[Henry Hallam]], [[Harriet Taylor]], [[Alexander Maconochie (penal reformer)|Alexander Maconochie]], [[Henry Hart Milman]], [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Monckton Milnes]], [[Sydney Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], [[Sarah Austin (translator)|Sarah Austin]], and [[Charles Lyell]], as well as [[Jane Welsh Carlyle]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. She met [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]], [[George Eliot]] and [[Charles Dickens]] later on in her literary career.\n\nUntil 1834 Martineau was occupied with her brother James on the [[political economy]] series, as well as a supplemental series of ''Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated and Illustrations of Taxation'' which was intended to directly influence government policy. About the same time, she published four stories expressing support of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[Poor Law]] reforms. These tales (direct, lucid, written without any appearance of effort, and yet practically effective) display the characteristics of their author's style. [[Tory]] paternalists reacted by calling her a [[Malthusian]] \"who deprecates charity and provision for the poor\", while [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] opposed her to the same degree.

He found him spending his days \"driving out Miss Martineau\", who had returned from her trip to the United States. Charles wrote to his sister, \n<blockquote>Our only protection from so admirable a sister-in-law is in her working him too hard.\" He commented, \"She already takes him to task about his idleness \u2014 She is going some day to explain to him her notions about marriage \u2014 Perfect equality of rights is part of her doctrine.

Charles noted that his father was upset by a piece in the ''Westminster Review'' calling for the radicals to break with the Whigs and give working men the vote \"before he knew it was not [Martineau's], and wasted a good deal of indignation, and even now can hardly believe it is not hers\".<ref name=\"Desmond 1991 205\">{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=205}}</ref> In early December 1836 Charles Darwin called on Martineau and may have discussed the social and natural worlds she was writing about in her book ''Society in America'', including the \"grandeur and beauty\" of the \"process of world making\" she had seen at [[Niagara Falls]].<ref name=\"Desmond 1991 205\"/> He remarked in a letter, <blockquote>She was very agreeable and managed to talk on a most wonderful number of subjects, considering the limited time.

She portrayed a failed love affair between a physician and his sister-in-law. It was considered her most successful novel.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/> She also wrote ''The Hour and the Man: An Historical Romance'' (1839), a three-volume novel about the Haitian slave leader [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]], who contributed to the island nation's gaining independence in 1804.\n\n==Newcastle and Tynemouth==\n[[File:Anne Whitney, Harriet Martineau, 1882, Davis Museum, Wellesley.tif|thumb|[[Anne Whitney]], ''Harriet Martineau'', 1882, [[Davis Museum at Wellesley College|Davis Museum]], [[Wellesley College]]]]\nIn 1839, during a visit to [[Continental Europe]], Martineau was diagnosed with a uterine tumour.  She several times visited her brother-in-law, [[Thomas Michael Greenhow]], who was a celebrated doctor in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to try to alleviate her symptoms.  On the last occasion she stayed for six months in the Greenhow family house at 28 Eldon Square. Immobile and confined to a couch, she was cared for by her mother until purchasing a house and hiring a nurse to aid her.\n\nShe next moved downriver to [[Tynemouth]], where she stayed at Mrs Halliday's boarding-house, 57 Front Street, for nearly five years from 16 March 1840. The establishment is still open as a guest house today, now named the \"Martineau Guest House\" in her honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Martineau Guest House|url=http://www.martineau-house.co.uk/|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe critic Diana Postlethwaite wrote of this period for Martineau: <blockquote>Being homebound is a major part of the process of becoming feminine. In this interior setting she (Martineau) is taught the home arts of working, serving, and cleaning, as well as the rehearsals for the role of mothering. She sees her mother... doing these things. They define femininity for her.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/></blockquote>Her illness caused her to literally enact the social constraints of women during this time.\n\nMartineau wrote a number of books during her illness, and a historical plaque marks this house. In 1841 she published a series of four novels for children, ''The Playfellow'', comprising ''The Settlers at Home'', ''The Peasant and the Prince'', ''Feats on the Fiord'', and ''The Crofton Boys''. In 1844 she published ''Life in the Sickroom: Essays by an Invalid,'' an autobiographical reflection on invalidism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|year=1844|title=Life in the Sickroom: Essays by an Invalid|publisher=Edward Moxon|place=London|edition=2nd|page=|url=https://archive.org/stream/lifeinsickroome01martgoog#page/n8/mode/2up|accessdate=14 June 2016|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> She wrote ''Household Education'' (1848), the handbook on the \"proper\" way to raise and educate children. Lastly, she began working on her autobiography.  Completed much later, it included some hundred pages on this period. Notable visitors included Richard Cobden and Thomas and Jane Carlyle.\n\n''Life in the Sickroom'' is considered to be one of Martineau's most under-rated works. It upset evangelical readers as they \"thought it dangerous in 'its supposition of self-reliance'\".<ref name=\"Winter 1995 597\u2013616\">{{cite journal|authorlink1=Alison Winter|last=Winter|first=Alison|title=Harriet Martineau and the Reform of the Invalid in Victorian England|journal=The Historical Journal|date=September 1995|volume=38|issue=3|pages=597\u2013616|jstor=264004|doi=10.1017/s0018246x00019993}}</ref> This series of essays embraced traditional womanhood. Martineau dedicated it to [[Elizabeth Barrett]], as it was \"an outpouring of feeling to an idealized female alter ego, both professional writer and professional invalid- and utterly unlike the women in her own family\". Written during a kind of public break from her mother, this book was Martineau's proclamation of independence.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Martineau turned the traditional patient\u2013doctor relationship on its head by asserting control over her space even in sickness. The sickroom was her space. ''Life in the Sickroom'' explained how to regain control even in illness. Alarmed that a woman was suggesting such a position in the power dynamic, critics suggested that, as she was an invalid, her mind must also be sick and the work was not to be taken seriously. ''British and Foreign Medical Review'' dismissed Martineau's piece on the same basis as the critics: an ill person cannot write a healthy work. They thought it was unheard of for a woman to suggest being in a position of control, especially in sickness. Instead, the ''Review'' recommended that patients follow \"unconditional submission\" to the advice of doctors.<ref name=\"Winter 1995 597\u2013616\"/> They disagreed with the idea that Martineau might hold any sort of \"authority to Britain's invalids\".<ref name=\"Winter 1995 597\u2013616\"/>\n\nExpecting to remain an invalid for the rest of her life, Martineau delighted in the new freedom of views using her [[telescope]]. Across the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] was the sandy beach \u2033where there are frequent wrecks\u2014too interesting to an invalid... and above the rocks, a spreading heath, where I watch troops of boys flying their kites; lovers and friends taking their breezy walks on Sundays...\"<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/> She expressed a lyrical view of Tynemouth:\n\n<blockquote>When I look forth in the morning, the whole land may be sheeted with glittering snow, while the myrtle-green sea swells and tumbles... there is none of the deadness of winter in the landscape; no leafless trees, no locking up with ice; and the air comes in through my open upper sash brisk, but sun-warmed. The robins twitter and hop in my flower-boxes... And at night, what a heaven! What an expanse of stars above, appearing more steadfast, the more the Northern Lights dart and quiver!<ref>''Life in the Sick-room: Essays by an Invalid'' by Harriet Martineau (2nd ed., 1844), [https://archive.org/stream/lifeinsickroome01martgoog#page/n72/mode/2up/ pp. 50-51].</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring her illness, she for a second time declined a pension on the [[civil list]], fearing to compromise her political independence. After publication of her letter on the subject, some of her friends raised a small [[Life annuity|annuity]] for her soon after.\n\nIn 1844 Martineau underwent a course of [[mesmerism]], returning to health after a few months. There was national interest in mesmerism at this time. Also known as 'animal magnetism', it can be defined as a \"loosely grouped set of practices in which one person influenced another through a variety of personal actions, or through the direct influence of one mind on another mind. Mesmerism was designed to make invisible forces augment the mental powers of the mesmeric object.\"<ref name=\"Winter 1995 597\u2013616\"/> She eventually published an account of her case in sixteen ''Letters on Mesmerism'', which caused much discussion.

She believed the ultimate goal to be philosophic [[atheism]], but did not explicitly say so in the book.  She described ancient tombs, \"the black pall of oblivion\" set against the [[Paschal cycle|paschal]] \"puppet show\" in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], and noted that Christian beliefs in reward and punishment were based on and similar to [[Paganism|heathen]] [[superstition]]s. Describing an [[ancient Egypt]]ian tomb, she wrote, \"How like ours were his life and death!... Compare him with a retired naval officer made country gentleman in our day, and in how much less do they differ than agree!\" The book's \"[[infidel]] tendency\" was too much for the publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], who rejected it. Martineau's biographer, Florence Fenwick Miller, wrote that \"all her best moral and intellectual faculties were exerted, and their action becomes visible, at one page or another\" of this work.<ref>Fenwick 1884, p. 109</ref>\n\nMartineau wrote ''[[Household Education]]'' in 1848, lamenting the state of women's education. She believed women had a natural inclination to motherhood and believed domestic work went hand in hand with academia for a proper, well-rounded education. She stated, \"I go further than most persons... in desiring thorough practice in domestic occupations, from an early age, for young girls\".<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/> She proposed that freedom and rationality, rather than command and obedience, are the most effectual instruments of education.\n\nHer interest in schemes of instruction led her to start a series of lectures, addressed at first to the school children of Ambleside, but afterward extended to their parents at the request of the adults. The subjects were sanitary principles and practice, the [[History of England|histories of England]] and [[History of North America|North America]], and the scenes of her Eastern travels. At the request of the publisher [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]], in 1849 she wrote ''The History of the Thirty Years' Peace, 1816\u20131846'', an excellent popular history from the point of view of a \"philosophical Radical\". Martineau spanned a wide variety of subject matter in her writing and did so with more assertiveness than was expected of women at the time. She has been described as having an \"essentially masculine nature\".<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/> It was commonly thought that a \"progressive\" woman, in being progressive, was improperly emulating the qualities of a man.\n\nMartineau's work included a widely used guide book to the [[Lake District]], ''A Complete Guide to the English Lakes'', published in 1855 and in its 4th edition by 1876.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book|title=A Complete Guide to the English Lakes|last=Martineau|first=Harriet|url=https://archive.org/stream/completeguidetoe1855mart#page/n7/mode/2up|date=nd|location=Windermere|publisher=John Garnett|via=Archive.org}}</ref><ref>reviewed in the ''Westmorland Gazette'', Saturday 8 July 1871, p.&nbsp;3, column 1</ref> This served as the definitive guidebook for the area for 25 years, effectively replacing the earlier [[Guide to the Lakes|guide]] by [[William Wordsworth]], and continued in common usage until the publication of [[M. J. B. Baddeley|Baddeley's]]  ''Thorough Guide to the English Lake District'' in 1880.\n\n[[File:Harriet Martineau sociologist.jpg|thumb|Martineau in her later years, painted by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]]]]\nMartineau edited a volume of ''Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development'', published in March 1851. Its epistolary form is based on correspondence between her and the self-styled scientist [[Henry G. Atkinson]].  She expounded the doctrine of philosophical atheism, which she thought the tendency of human belief . She did not deny a [[Cosmological argument|first cause]] but declared it [[Agnosticism|unknowable]].  She and Atkinson thought they affirmed man's [[moral obligation]]. Atkinson was a zealous exponent of mesmerism. The prominence given to the topics of mesmerism and [[clairvoyance]] heightened the general disapproval of the book.  Literary London was outraged by its mesmeric [[evolutionism|evolutionary]] atheism, and the book caused a lasting division between Martineau, her beloved brother, James who had become a Unitarian cleric, and some of her friends.\n\nFrom 1852 to 1866, she contributed regularly to the ''[[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]'', writing sometimes six leaders a week. She wrote over 1600 articles for the paper in total.<ref name=\"spartacus-educational.com\"/>  It also published her ''Letters from Ireland'', written during a visit to that country in the summer of 1852.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersofcharlot0001bron|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/lettersofcharlot0001bron/page/120 120]|quote=Letters from ireland 1852.|title=The Letters of Charlotte Bront\u00eb: 1852-1855|first=Charlotte|last=Bront\u00eb|date=7 August 1995|publisher=Clarendon|accessdate=7 August 2019|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> For many years she was a contributor to the ''[[Westminster Review]]''; in 1854 she was among financial supporters who prevented its closing down.\n\nMartineau believed she was psychosomatic; this medical belief of the times related the uterus to emotions and hysteria. She had symptoms of hysteria in her loss of taste and smell.  Her partial deafness throughout life may have contributed to her problems. Various people, including the maid, her brother,<ref name=\"Winter 1995 597\u2013616\"/> and Spencer T. Hall (a notable mesmerist) performed mesmerism on her.  Some historians attribute her apparent recovery from symptoms to a shift in the positioning of her tumor so that it no longer obstructed other organs. As the physical improvements were the first signs of healing she had in five years and happened at the same time of her first mesmeric treatment, Martineau confidentially credited mesmerism with her \"cure\".<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/>\n\nShe continued her political activism during the late 1850s and 1860s. She supported the Married Women's Property Bill and in 1856 signed a petition for it organised by Barbara Bodichon.  She also pushed for licensed prostitution and laws that addressed the customers rather than the women.  She supported women's [[suffrage]]<ref name=\"auto1\"/> and signed Bodichon's petition in its favour in 1866.\n\nIn the early part of 1855, Martineau was suffering from [[heart disease]]. She began to write her autobiography, as she expected her life to end. Completing the book rapidly in three months,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> she postponed its publication until after her death, and lived another two decades.  It was published posthumously in 1877.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/>\n\nWhen Darwin's book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was published in 1859, his brother Erasmus sent a copy to his old flame Harriet Martineau.  At age 58, she was still reviewing from her home in the Lake District. From her \"snow landscape\", Martineau sent her thanks, adding that she had previously praised\n<blockquote>the quality & conduct of your brother's mind, but it is an unspeakable satisfaction to see here the full manifestation of its earnestness & simplicity, its sagacity, its industry, & the patient power by which it has collected such a mass of facts, to transmute them by such sagacious treatment into such portentous knowledge. I should much like to know how large a proportion of our scientific men believe he has found a sound road.</blockquote>Martineau supported Darwin's theory because it was not based in theology. Martineau strove for secularism stating, \"In the present state of the religious world, Secularism ought to flourish. What an amount of sin and woe might and would then be extinguished.\"<ref name=\"bell\" /> She wrote to her fellow [[Thomas Malthus|Malthusian]] (and atheist) [[George Holyoake]] enthusing, \"What a book it is! \u2013 overthrowing (if true) revealed Religion on the one hand, & Natural (as far as Final Causes & Design are concerned) on the other. The range & mass of knowledge take away one's breath.\" To Fanny Wedgwood (the wife of [[Hensleigh Wedgwood]]) she wrote,\n<blockquote>I rather regret that C.D. went out of his way two or three times to speak of \"The [[Creator God|Creator]]\" in the popular sense of the First Cause.... His subject is the \"Origin of Species\" & not the origin of Organisation; & it seems a needless mischief to have opened the latter speculation at all \u2013 There now! I have delivered my mind.</blockquote>\n\n==Economics and social sciences==\nHarriet Martineau propounds political economic theories in ''Illustrations of Political Economy''. She is seen as a frontrunner who merges fiction and economy in a time period when \"fiction claimed authority over emotional knowledge, while economics claimed authority over empirical knowledge\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Making a Social Body: British Cultural Formation 1830\u20131864.|last=Poovey|first=Mary|publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=132\u201333}}</ref> Moreover, Martineau's text sets the stage for women to enter into economics. For example, Dalley Lana explains that \"by bringing the topic of domestic economy to bear on political economy, Martineau places women more centrally within economic theory and practice. In this context, women \u2013 as readers of the ''Illustrations'' and as characters with the tales \u2013 are not only rendered a part of larger-scale economics but also (because of their participation) encourage to learn the principles of political economy.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.branchcollective.org/?ps_articles=lana-l-dalley-on-martineaus-illustrations-of-political-economy-1832-34|title=On Martineau's Illustrations of Political Economy, 1832\u201334|date=|accessdate=30 November 2015|website=BRANCH: Britain, Representation|publisher=|last=Dalley|first=Lana L.}}</ref>\n\nAs early as 1831, Martineau wrote on the subject \"Political Economy\" (as the field of economics was then known). Her goal was to popularise and illustrate the principles of ''[[laissez faire]]'' capitalism, though she made no claim to original theorising.\n\nMartineau's reflections on ''Society in America'', published in 1837, are prime examples of her sociological methods. Her ideas in this field were set out in her 1838 book ''[[How to Observe Morals and Manners]]''. She believed that some very general social laws influence the life of any society, including the principle of progress, the emergence of science as the most advanced product of human intellectual endeavour, and the significance of population dynamics and the natural physical environment.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[Auguste Comte]] coined the name sociology and published a rambling exposition under the title of ''Cours de Philosophie Positive'' in 1839.  Martineau undertook a translation that was published in two volumes in 1853 as ''The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte (freely translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau)''. It was a remarkable achievement, and a successful one; Comte recommended her volumes to his students instead of his own. Some writers regard Martineau as the first female sociologist. Her introduction of Comte to the English-speaking world and the elements of sociological perspective in her original writings support her credit as a sociologist.<ref name=\"Sociology\">{{cite book|author1=Anthony Giddens|author2=Simon Griffiths|title=Sociology|url=https://archive.org/details/sociology0005gidd|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Polity|page=[https://archive.org/details/sociology0005gidd/page/20 20]}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:The lower section of the Reformers memorial, Kensal Green Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Harriet Martineau's name on the lower section of the Reformers memorial, Kensal Green Cemetery]]\nHarriet Martineau died of bronchitis<ref name=\"spartacus-educational.com\"/> at \"The Knoll\" on 27 June 1876.

With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she could see clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression to what she had to say. In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1877 her autobiography was published. It was rare for a woman to publish such a work, let alone one secular in nature. Her book was regarded as dispassionate, \"philosophic to the core\" in its perceived masculinity, and a work of [[necessitarianism]]. She deeply explored childhood experiences and memories, expressing feelings of having been deprived of her mother's affection, as well as strong devotion to her brother [[James Martineau]], a theologian.<ref name=\"Postlethwaite 1989\"/>\n\nAnthony Giddens and Simon Griffiths argue that Martineau is a neglected founder of sociology and that she remains important today. She taught that study of the society must include all its aspects, including key political, religious and social institutions, and she insisted on the need to include the lives of women.  She was the first sociologist to study such issues as marriage, children, religious life, and race relations.  Finally, she called on sociologists to do more than just observe, but also work to benefit the society.<ref name=\"Sociology\"/>\n\nIn February 2014, it was reported that London's [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] held several portraits of Harriet, whose great nephew, [[Lupton family|Francis Martineau Lupton]], was the great\u2013great\u2013grandfather of [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], the gallery's patron.<ref>{{cite web|last=Furness|first=Hannah|title=Duchess of Cambridge visits National Portrait Gallery, home to little-known Middleton family paintings.|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/10631996/Duchess-of-Cambridge-visits-National-Portrait-Gallery-home-of-little-known-Middleton-family-paintings.html|date=11 February 2014|page=3|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref> Harriet was close to her niece [[Frances Lupton]], who worked to open up [[Female education#Modern period|educational opportunities for women]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Edited by Elisabeth Sanders Arbuckle|first1=Harriet Martineau|title=Harriet Martineau's Letters to Fanny Wedgwood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yR2rAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA154|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=150|date=1 January 1983|isbn=9780804711463|accessdate=15 May 2015|quote=(May 1857) My (H.

Along with the foundress, [[Madeleine-Sophie Barat]], she was a prominent early member of the [[Society of the Sacred Heart|Religious Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]], and founded the [[Religious congregation|congregation]]'s first communities in the United States. She spent the last half of her life teaching and serving the people of the [[Midwestern United States]], then the western frontier of the nation.\n\nDuchesne was beatified on May 12, 1940, and canonized on July 3, 1988, by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nShe was born in [[Grenoble]], then the capital of the ancient [[provinces of France|Province]] of the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in the [[Kingdom of France]], the second of seven daughters, along with one son. Her father, Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Duchesne (1748\u20131797), was a prominent lawyer during the [[Day of the Tiles]].<ref name=\"RSCJ\">{{cite web|url=https://rscj.org/who-we-are/heritage/st-rose-philippine-duchesne|work=Society of the Sacred Heart-United States & Canada|title=St. Rose Philippine Duchesne}}</ref> Her mother, Rose-Euphrosine P\u00e9rier (1743\u20131814), was the sister of [[Claude Perier|Claude P\u00e9rier]], an industrialist who later helped finance the rise to power of [[Napoleon]]. Pierre-Francois and  Rose-Euphrosine, shared the home of her parents in Grenoble with her brother, Claude Perier, and his wife \u2013 the two young couples living on separate floors. Claude P\u00e9rier's son, [[Casimir Pierre P\u00e9rier|Casimir]], later a [[Prime Minister of France]], was the grandfather of [[Jean Casimir-Perier]], a [[President of France]]. She was raised in an enormous family home across from the Parliament building or Palace of Justice in Grenoble.<ref>Philippine Duchesne: A Woman with the Poor\nBy Catherine M. Mooney</ref>\n\n===Monastery of the Visitation===\nAfter surviving a bout of smallpox which left her slightly scarred, in 1781 Rose Duchesne and her cousin Josephine were sent to be educated in the [[Mus\u00e9e dauphinois|Monastery of Sainte-Marie-d'en-Haut]] (known for the social status of its members), located on a mountainside near Grenoble, by the community of [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary|Visitandine nuns]]. When she began to show a strong attraction to the monastic life, her father withdrew her from the monastery school the following year and had her tutored with her cousins in the family home. In 1788 she made the decision to \nenter the Visitation of Holy Mary religious order, despite her family's opposition. She convinced an aunt to accompany her on a visit to the monastery, where she immediately requested admission, leaving her aunt to return home without her and to tell her father what happened.<ref name=\"FM\">{{cite web|url=http://catholicism.org/saint-rose-philippine-duchesne.html|title=Frontier Missionary of the Sacred Heart: Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne (1769\u20131852)|first=Sister|last=Jeanne Marie, MI.C.M., Tert.|work=Catholicism.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1792, however, revolutionaries shut down the monastery, during the [[French Revolution]]'s [[Reign of Terror]], and dispersed the [[nun]]<nowiki/>s. Duchesne returned to her family where she lived at their country home, along with two aunts, who had been [[Visitandines]] at [[Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re]]. She attempted to continue living the Rule of Life of her Order, while serving her family and those suffering from the Reign of Terror, including those imprisoned at the former monastery.<ref name=RSCJ/>\n\nWith the Catholic Church again able to operate openly in France under [[Napoleon]], in  1801 Duchesne attempted to re-establish the Visitation monastery, acquiring the buildings from its new owner. The buildings were in shambles, having been used as a military barracks and prison. Though a few of the nuns and the Mother Superior did return temporarily, the nuns found that the austere living conditions was too much for them in their advanced years. Eventually Duchesne, now the Mother Superior of the house, was left with only three companions.<ref name=FM/>\n\n==Society of the Sacred Heart==\nWhile the restored Visitandine community was floundering, in northern France, [[Madeleine-Sophie Barat]] was founding the new [[Society of the Sacred Heart]]\u2014whose members were long known as the \"Madames of the Sacred Heart\" from their use of that title, due to the hostility to religious communities which lingered in post-Revolutionary France. She wanted to establish a new foundation in Grenoble. Encouraged by her mentor, the Jesuit priest, Joseph Varin, to meet Duchesne, in 1804 she traveled there. Duchesne accepted Barat's offer to merge the Visitation community into the Society of the Sacred Heart. The new congregation had a similar religious mission as that of the Visitandines, that of educating young women, but without being an [[enclosed religious order]]. The two women became immediate and lifelong friends.<ref name=RSCJ/>\n\nIn 1815, after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Duchesne followed Barat's instructions and established a Convent of the Sacred Heart in [[Paris]], where she both opened a school and became the [[Master of novices|Mistress of novices]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Missionary in America===\nDuring her childhood, Duchesne had heard many stories in her [[parish church]] from missionary priests of life in [[Louisiana]], founded as a colony of [[Louisiana (New France)|New France]], and had long felt a desire to serve the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who lived there. In 1817, [[Louis William Valentine Dubourg|William Dubourg]], [[Sulpicians|S.S.]], [[Catholic bishop|Bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas]], visited the convent in Paris. Bishop Dubourg was looking for a congregation of educators to help him evangelize the Indian and French children of his diocese.<ref name=va>[https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_19880703_duchesne_en.html \"Rose-Philippine Duchesne (1769\u20131852)\", Vatican News Service]</ref> After meeting him, Duchesne, who had never lost her desire to serve as a missionary, begged permission from Barat to serve in the bishop's diocese.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n====Missouri====\nIn 1818, with Barat's blessing, Duchesne headed out to the United States with four other Sisters of the Society. After ten weeks at sea, they arrived in [[New Orleans]]. To their shock, however, the bishop had made no provisions for housing them. After they had rested briefly with the [[Ursuline nuns]], they took advantage of the newly established [[steamboat]] service up the [[Mississippi River]] to travel to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], and finally settled in [[St. Charles, Missouri|St. Charles]], in what was then the [[Missouri Territory]], a journey of seven weeks.

Their new foundation faced many struggles, including lack of funds, inadequate housing, hunger and very cold weather, and the Sisters struggled to learn English. By 1828, the Society's first five members in America had grown to six communities, operating several schools.<ref>\n  Fawcett Thomas, Sarah. (1996).

In 1826 [[Pope Leo XII]], through a ''[[decretum laudis]]'', formally approved the Society of the Sacred Heart, recognizing their work. The Jesuits acquired the Sisters' former school property in St. Charles in 1828, where they built a parish church, and asked the Sisters to return{{snd}}to that same log cabin where they had lived, in fact, because it was still the biggest house in town{{snd}}and conduct the parish school.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n====Kansas====\nIn 1841 the Jesuits asked the Sisters to join them in a new mission with the [[Potawatomi]] tribe in eastern Kansas, along [[Sugar Creek (Missouri River)|Sugar Creek]], where father [[Christian Hoecken]] was taking charge. At age seventy-one, she was not among those initially selected for the trip. Father Verhaegen insisted, \"She may not be able to do much work, but she will assure success to the mission by praying for us.\" Since Duchesne was unable to master their language, she was not able to teach, so she would spend long periods in prayer. The children named her ''Quahkahkanumad'', which translates as ''Woman Who Prays Always''.<ref name=Callan>Callan R.S.C.J., Louise. in reference to stories told of small trinkets placed on her robes which were still in the same place hours later.

Toward the end of her life, she was alone, going blind, feeble, and yearned for letters from Mother Barat.

She was then reburied in a crypt within a small shrine on the convent grounds. The cause for Duchesne's [[canonization]] was introduced in 1895. She was declared [[Venerable]] in 1909 by [[Pope Pius X]] and was [[beatified]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1940. The [[Holy See]] ordered in 1951 that she be buried more suitably.

Along with the foundress, [[Madeleine-Sophie Barat]], she was a prominent early member of the [[Society of the Sacred Heart|Religious Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]], and founded the [[Religious congregation|congregation]]'s first communities in the United States. She spent the last half of her life teaching and serving the people of the [[Midwestern United States]], then the western frontier of the nation.\n\nDuchesne was beatified on May 12, 1940, and canonized on July 3, 1988, by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nShe was born in [[Grenoble]], then the capital of the ancient [[provinces of France|Province]] of the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in the [[Kingdom of France]], the second of seven daughters, along with one son. Her father, Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Duchesne (1748\u20131797), was a prominent lawyer during the [[Day of the Tiles]].<ref name=\"RSCJ\">{{cite web|url=https://rscj.org/who-we-are/heritage/st-rose-philippine-duchesne|work=Society of the Sacred Heart-United States & Canada|title=St. Rose Philippine Duchesne}}</ref> Her mother, Rose-Euphrosine P\u00e9rier (1743\u20131814), was the sister of [[Claude Perier|Claude P\u00e9rier]], an industrialist who later helped finance the rise to power of [[Napoleon]]. Pierre-Francois and  Rose-Euphrosine, shared the home of her parents in Grenoble with her brother, Claude Perier, and his wife \u2013 the two young couples living on separate floors. Claude P\u00e9rier's son, [[Casimir Pierre P\u00e9rier|Casimir]], later a [[Prime Minister of France]], was the grandfather of [[Jean Casimir-Perier]], a [[President of France]]. She was raised in an enormous family home across from the Parliament building or Palace of Justice in Grenoble.<ref>Philippine Duchesne: A Woman with the Poor\nBy Catherine M. Mooney</ref>\n\n===Monastery of the Visitation===\nAfter surviving a bout of smallpox which left her slightly scarred, in 1781 Rose Duchesne and her cousin Josephine were sent to be educated in the [[Mus\u00e9e dauphinois|Monastery of Sainte-Marie-d'en-Haut]] (known for the social status of its members), located on a mountainside near Grenoble, by the community of [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary|Visitandine nuns]]. When she began to show a strong attraction to the monastic life, her father withdrew her from the monastery school the following year and had her tutored with her cousins in the family home. In 1788 she made the decision to \nenter the Visitation of Holy Mary religious order, despite her family's opposition. She convinced an aunt to accompany her on a visit to the monastery, where she immediately requested admission, leaving her aunt to return home without her and to tell her father what happened.<ref name=\"FM\">{{cite web|url=http://catholicism.org/saint-rose-philippine-duchesne.html|title=Frontier Missionary of the Sacred Heart: Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne (1769\u20131852)|first=Sister|last=Jeanne Marie, MI.C.M., Tert.|work=Catholicism.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1792, however, revolutionaries shut down the monastery, during the [[French Revolution]]'s [[Reign of Terror]], and dispersed the [[nun]]<nowiki/>s. Duchesne returned to her family where she lived at their country home, along with two aunts, who had been [[Visitandines]] at [[Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re]]. She attempted to continue living the Rule of Life of her Order, while serving her family and those suffering from the Reign of Terror, including those imprisoned at the former monastery.<ref name=RSCJ/>\n\nWith the Catholic Church again able to operate openly in France under [[Napoleon]], in  1801 Duchesne attempted to re-establish the Visitation monastery, acquiring the buildings from its new owner. The buildings were in shambles, having been used as a military barracks and prison. Though a few of the nuns and the Mother Superior did return temporarily, the nuns found that the austere living conditions was too much for them in their advanced years. Eventually Duchesne, now the Mother Superior of the house, was left with only three companions.<ref name=FM/>\n\n==Society of the Sacred Heart==\nWhile the restored Visitandine community was floundering, in northern France, [[Madeleine-Sophie Barat]] was founding the new [[Society of the Sacred Heart]]\u2014whose members were long known as the \"Madames of the Sacred Heart\" from their use of that title, due to the hostility to religious communities which lingered in post-Revolutionary France. She wanted to establish a new foundation in Grenoble. Encouraged by her mentor, the Jesuit priest, Joseph Varin, to meet Duchesne, in 1804 she traveled there. Duchesne accepted Barat's offer to merge the Visitation community into the Society of the Sacred Heart. The new congregation had a similar religious mission as that of the Visitandines, that of educating young women, but without being an [[enclosed religious order]]. The two women became immediate and lifelong friends.<ref name=RSCJ/>\n\nIn 1815, after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Duchesne followed Barat's instructions and established a Convent of the Sacred Heart in [[Paris]], where she both opened a school and became the [[Master of novices|Mistress of novices]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Missionary in America===\nDuring her childhood, Duchesne had heard many stories in her [[parish church]] from missionary priests of life in [[Louisiana]], founded as a colony of [[Louisiana (New France)|New France]], and had long felt a desire to serve the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who lived there. In 1817, [[Louis William Valentine Dubourg|William Dubourg]], [[Sulpicians|S.S.]], [[Catholic bishop|Bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas]], visited the convent in Paris. Bishop Dubourg was looking for a congregation of educators to help him evangelize the Indian and French children of his diocese.<ref name=va>[https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_19880703_duchesne_en.html \"Rose-Philippine Duchesne (1769\u20131852)\", Vatican News Service]</ref> After meeting him, Duchesne, who had never lost her desire to serve as a missionary, begged permission from Barat to serve in the bishop's diocese.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n====Missouri====\nIn 1818, with Barat's blessing, Duchesne headed out to the United States with four other Sisters of the Society. After ten weeks at sea, they arrived in [[New Orleans]]. To their shock, however, the bishop had made no provisions for housing them. After they had rested briefly with the [[Ursuline nuns]], they took advantage of the newly established [[steamboat]] service up the [[Mississippi River]] to travel to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], and finally settled in [[St. Charles, Missouri|St. Charles]], in what was then the [[Missouri Territory]], a journey of seven weeks.

Their new foundation faced many struggles, including lack of funds, inadequate housing, hunger and very cold weather, and the Sisters struggled to learn English. By 1828, the Society's first five members in America had grown to six communities, operating several schools.<ref>\n  Fawcett Thomas, Sarah. (1996).

In 1826 [[Pope Leo XII]], through a ''[[decretum laudis]]'', formally approved the Society of the Sacred Heart, recognizing their work. The Jesuits acquired the Sisters' former school property in St. Charles in 1828, where they built a parish church, and asked the Sisters to return{{snd}}to that same log cabin where they had lived, in fact, because it was still the biggest house in town{{snd}}and conduct the parish school.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n====Kansas====\nIn 1841 the Jesuits asked the Sisters to join them in a new mission with the [[Potawatomi]] tribe in eastern Kansas, along [[Sugar Creek (Missouri River)|Sugar Creek]], where father [[Christian Hoecken]] was taking charge. At age seventy-one, she was not among those initially selected for the trip. Father Verhaegen insisted, \"She may not be able to do much work, but she will assure success to the mission by praying for us.\" Since Duchesne was unable to master their language, she was not able to teach, so she would spend long periods in prayer. The children named her ''Quahkahkanumad'', which translates as ''Woman Who Prays Always''.<ref name=Callan>Callan R.S.C.J., Louise. in reference to stories told of small trinkets placed on her robes which were still in the same place hours later.

Toward the end of her life, she was alone, going blind, feeble, and yearned for letters from Mother Barat.

She was then reburied in a crypt within a small shrine on the convent grounds. The cause for Duchesne's [[canonization]] was introduced in 1895. She was declared [[Venerable]] in 1909 by [[Pope Pius X]] and was [[beatified]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1940. The [[Holy See]] ordered in 1951 that she be buried more suitably.

The combination of his red hair and the large, shiny buttons on the bellhop uniforms inspired orchestra leader Charles \"Dinty\" Moore to call him \"Red Buttons,\" the name under which he would later perform.\n\nLater that same summer Buttons worked on the [[Borscht Belt]];<ref name=\"bbc\"/> his [[double act|straight man]] was [[Robert Alda]]. Buttons was working at the Irvington Hotel in South Fallsburg, New York, when the Master of Ceremonies became incapacitated, and he asked for the chance to replace him. In 1939 Buttons started working for [[Minsky's Burlesque]]; in 1941, [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] chose Buttons to appear in a [[Broadway theater|Broadway show]] ''The Admiral Had a Wife''. The show was a [[farce]] set in [[Pearl Harbor]], and it was due to open on December 8, 1941. It never did, as it was deemed inappropriate after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack]]. In later years Buttons would joke that the Japanese only attacked Pearl Harbor to keep him off Broadway.\n\n==Career==\nIn September 1942 Buttons made his Broadway debut in ''Vickie'' with Ferrer and [[Uta Hagen]]. Later that year he appeared in the Minsky's show ''Wine, Women and Song.'' This was the last classic [[American burlesque|Burlesque]] show in New York City history, as the Mayor [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia|La Guardia]] administration closed it down. Buttons was on stage when the show was raided.\n\nDrafted into the [[United States Army Air Forces]], Buttons in 1943 appeared in the Army Air Forces' Broadway show ''[[Winged Victory (play)|Winged Victory]]'', along with several future stars, including [[Mario Lanza]], [[John Forsythe]], [[Karl Malden]] and [[Lee J. Cobb]]. A year later he appeared in [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]'s movie version of ''[[Winged Victory (film)|Winged Victory]]'', directed by [[George Cukor]]. Buttons also entertained troops in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theater]] in the same [[Jeep Show]] unit as [[Mickey Rooney]].\n\nAfter the war Buttons continued to do Broadway shows. He also performed at Broadway movie houses with [[big band]]s. In 1952, Buttons received his own variety series on television, ''[[The Red Buttons Show]]'', which ran for three years on [[CBS]].  It was the #11 show in prime time in 1952.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1952.htm|title=ClassicTVHits.com: TV Ratings > 1950's|website=www.classictvhits.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008121134/http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1952.htm|archivedate=8 October 2017}}</ref> In 1953 he recorded and had a two-sided hit with ''Strange Things Are Happening/The Ho Ho Song'', with both sides/songs essentially being the same.\n\nHis role in ''[[Sayonara]]'' was a dramatic departure from his previous work. In this film, co-starring with [[Marlon Brando]], he played Joe Kelly, an [[United States Air Force|American airman]] stationed in [[Kobe]], Japan during the [[Korean War]], who marries Katsumi, a Japanese woman (played by [[Miyoshi Umeki]]), but is barred from taking her back to the United States. His moving portrayal of Kelly's calm resolve not to abandon the relationship, and the touching reassurance of Katsumi, impressed audiences and critics alike.  Buttons won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and Umeki won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for the film.\n\n[[File:Red Buttons Double Life of Henry Phyfe 1965.JPG|thumb|180px|Buttons as Henry Phyfe]]\nAfter his Oscar-winning role Buttons performed in numerous feature films, including the Africa adventure ''[[Hatari!]]'' with [[John Wayne]], the adventure ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon (film)|Five Weeks in a Balloon]]'' (1962) (where he received top billing), the war epic ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'', the biopic ''[[Harlow (Paramount film)|Harlow]]'', the disaster film ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'', the dance-marathon drama ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'', the family comedy ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'', the disaster film ''[[When Time Ran Out]]'' with [[Paul Newman]] and the age-reversal comedy ''[[18 Again!]]'' with [[George Burns]].\n\nIn 1966 Buttons again starred in his own TV series, a spy spoof called ''[[The Double Life of Henry Phyfe]]'', which ran for one season. Buttons also made guest appearances on several TV programs including ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'', ''[[Knots Landing]]'' and ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''.  His last TV role was in ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.\n\nHe became a nationally recognisable comedian, and his \"Never Got A Dinner\" routine was a standard of ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' for many years. He made numerous appearances at [[Friars Club of Beverly Hills|Friars Club]] roasts and [[Chabad]] telethons, where he was often brought on and off stage to the tune of [[Hava Nagila]], which he chose as a theme song to emphasize his cultural identification as a [[Jew]]. (He once told an interviewer, \"I'm a Jew who is doing comedy, not a `Jewish comic'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jweekly.com/1998/12/11/stage-screen-giant-red-buttons-pressing-all-the-rights-ones-at-80/}}</ref>) \n\nHis best-known [[catchphrase]], \"Never got a dinner!\" formed the basis for elaborately eccentric lists of famous people (and their mothers) who had not been honoured with celebrity dinner roasts. Another of his catchphrases was \"I did not come here to be made sport of,\" which was later taken up by the radio talk show host [[Howie Carr]].\n\nButtons received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for television, his star being located at 1651 Vine Street. He was number 71 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the ''100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time''.\n\n==Personal life==\nButtons married actress Roxanne Arlen in 1947, but the marriage soon ended in divorce. He married Helayne McNorton on December 8, 1949.  They divorced in 1963. His last marriage was to Alicia Pratts, which lasted from January 27, 1964, until her death in March 2001. Buttons had two children, Amy Buttons and Adam Buttons. He was the advertising spokesman for [[Century Village, Florida]], a [[retirement community]].\n\nButtons was an early member of the Synagogue for the Performing Arts, and at the time Rabbi [[Jerome Cutler]] was the Rabbi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/8150/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717234252/http://www.forward.com/articles/8150/ |archivedate=2009-07-17 }} ''The Forward''</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nButtons died of complications from [[cardiovascular disease]] on July 13, 2006, at age 87 at his home in [[Century City (Los Angeles)|Century City]], Los Angeles.

He won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Oscar]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] for his supporting role in the 1957 film ''[[Sayonara]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nRed Buttons was born Aaron Chwatt<ref name=\"bbc\"/> on February 5, 1919, in [[Manhattan]],<ref name=\"bbc\"/> to [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants Sophie (n\u00e9e Baker) and Michael Chwatt.<ref name=\"judaicaref\">{{cite encyclopedia | title =Motion Pictures| encyclopedia =Encyclopaedia Judaica| volume=| pages =| publisher =Keter Publishing House| date =1971\u20131972| id =}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/55/Red-Buttons.html|title=Red Buttons Biography (1919-)|website=www.filmreference.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221100532/http://www.filmreference.com/film/55/Red-Buttons.html|archivedate=21 February 2018}}</ref> At sixteen years old, Chwatt got a job as an entertaining [[bellhop]] at Ryan's Tavern in [[City Island, Bronx]]. The combination of his red hair and the large, shiny buttons on the bellhop uniforms inspired orchestra leader Charles \"Dinty\" Moore to call him \"Red Buttons,\" the name under which he would later perform.\n\nLater that same summer Buttons worked on the [[Borscht Belt]];<ref name=\"bbc\"/> his [[double act|straight man]] was [[Robert Alda]]. Buttons was working at the Irvington Hotel in South Fallsburg, New York, when the Master of Ceremonies became incapacitated, and he asked for the chance to replace him. In 1939 Buttons started working for [[Minsky's Burlesque]]; in 1941, [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] chose Buttons to appear in a [[Broadway theater|Broadway show]] ''The Admiral Had a Wife''. The show was a [[farce]] set in [[Pearl Harbor]], and it was due to open on December 8, 1941. It never did, as it was deemed inappropriate after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack]]. In later years Buttons would joke that the Japanese only attacked Pearl Harbor to keep him off Broadway.\n\n==Career==\nIn September 1942 Buttons made his Broadway debut in ''Vickie'' with Ferrer and [[Uta Hagen]]. Later that year he appeared in the Minsky's show ''Wine, Women and Song.'' This was the last classic [[American burlesque|Burlesque]] show in New York City history, as the Mayor [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia|La Guardia]] administration closed it down. Buttons was on stage when the show was raided.\n\nDrafted into the [[United States Army Air Forces]], Buttons in 1943 appeared in the Army Air Forces' Broadway show ''[[Winged Victory (play)|Winged Victory]]'', along with several future stars, including [[Mario Lanza]], [[John Forsythe]], [[Karl Malden]] and [[Lee J. Cobb]]. A year later he appeared in [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]'s movie version of ''[[Winged Victory (film)|Winged Victory]]'', directed by [[George Cukor]]. Buttons also entertained troops in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theater]] in the same [[Jeep Show]] unit as [[Mickey Rooney]].\n\nAfter the war Buttons continued to do Broadway shows. He also performed at Broadway movie houses with [[big band]]s. In 1952, Buttons received his own variety series on television, ''[[The Red Buttons Show]]'', which ran for three years on [[CBS]].  It was the #11 show in prime time in 1952.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1952.htm|title=ClassicTVHits.com: TV Ratings > 1950's|website=www.classictvhits.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008121134/http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1952.htm|archivedate=8 October 2017}}</ref> In 1953 he recorded and had a two-sided hit with ''Strange Things Are Happening/The Ho Ho Song'', with both sides/songs essentially being the same.\n\nHis role in ''[[Sayonara]]'' was a dramatic departure from his previous work. In this film, co-starring with [[Marlon Brando]], he played Joe Kelly, an [[United States Air Force|American airman]] stationed in [[Kobe]], Japan during the [[Korean War]], who marries Katsumi, a Japanese woman (played by [[Miyoshi Umeki]]), but is barred from taking her back to the United States. His moving portrayal of Kelly's calm resolve not to abandon the relationship, and the touching reassurance of Katsumi, impressed audiences and critics alike.  Buttons won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and Umeki won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for the film.\n\n[[File:Red Buttons Double Life of Henry Phyfe 1965.JPG|thumb|180px|Buttons as Henry Phyfe]]\nAfter his Oscar-winning role Buttons performed in numerous feature films, including the Africa adventure ''[[Hatari!]]'' with [[John Wayne]], the adventure ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon (film)|Five Weeks in a Balloon]]'' (1962) (where he received top billing), the war epic ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'', the biopic ''[[Harlow (Paramount film)|Harlow]]'', the disaster film ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'', the dance-marathon drama ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'', the family comedy ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'', the disaster film ''[[When Time Ran Out]]'' with [[Paul Newman]] and the age-reversal comedy ''[[18 Again!]]'' with [[George Burns]].\n\nIn 1966 Buttons again starred in his own TV series, a spy spoof called ''[[The Double Life of Henry Phyfe]]'', which ran for one season. Buttons also made guest appearances on several TV programs including ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'', ''[[Knots Landing]]'' and ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''.  His last TV role was in ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.\n\nHe became a nationally recognisable comedian, and his \"Never Got A Dinner\" routine was a standard of ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' for many years. He made numerous appearances at [[Friars Club of Beverly Hills|Friars Club]] roasts and [[Chabad]] telethons, where he was often brought on and off stage to the tune of [[Hava Nagila]], which he chose as a theme song to emphasize his cultural identification as a [[Jew]]. (He once told an interviewer, \"I'm a Jew who is doing comedy, not a `Jewish comic'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jweekly.com/1998/12/11/stage-screen-giant-red-buttons-pressing-all-the-rights-ones-at-80/}}</ref>) \n\nHis best-known [[catchphrase]], \"Never got a dinner!\" formed the basis for elaborately eccentric lists of famous people (and their mothers) who had not been honoured with celebrity dinner roasts. Another of his catchphrases was \"I did not come here to be made sport of,\" which was later taken up by the radio talk show host [[Howie Carr]].\n\nButtons received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for television, his star being located at 1651 Vine Street. He was number 71 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the ''100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time''.\n\n==Personal life==\nButtons married actress Roxanne Arlen in 1947, but the marriage soon ended in divorce. He married Helayne McNorton on December 8, 1949.  They divorced in 1963. His last marriage was to Alicia Pratts, which lasted from January 27, 1964, until her death in March 2001. Buttons had two children, Amy Buttons and Adam Buttons. He was the advertising spokesman for [[Century Village, Florida]], a [[retirement community]].\n\nButtons was an early member of the Synagogue for the Performing Arts, and at the time Rabbi [[Jerome Cutler]] was the Rabbi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/8150/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717234252/http://www.forward.com/articles/8150/ |archivedate=2009-07-17 }} ''The Forward''</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nButtons died of complications from [[cardiovascular disease]] on July 13, 2006, at age 87 at his home in [[Century City (Los Angeles)|Century City]], Los Angeles.
