It has an estimated five million native speakers in Turkmenistan, a further 719,000 speakers in Northeastern [[Iran]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/IR/status|title=Iran|website=Ethnologue}}</ref> and 1.5 million people in Northwestern [[Afghanistan]].<ref name=e18>{{Ethnologue18|tuk}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many [[Iranian Turkmen|Iranian]] \"Turkmen\" are speakers of [[Khorasani Turkic language|Khorasani Turkic]]. Moreover, [[Iraqi Turkmen|Iraqi]] and [[Syrian Turkmen|Syrian]] \"Turkmen\" speak dialects that form a [[dialect continuum|continuum]] between [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], in both cases heavily influenced by [[Arabic]]. These three varieties are not Turkmen in the sense of this article.\n\n== Classification ==\nTurkmen is a member of the East Oghuz branch of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic family]] of languages; its closest relatives being Turkish and Azerbaijani, with which it shares a relatively high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].\n\nTurkmen has [[vowel harmony]], is [[agglutinative]] and has no grammatical gender. Word order is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]].\n\nWritten Turkmen today is based on the Teke (Tekke) dialect. The other dialects are Nohurly, \u00ddomud, \u00c4newli, Hasarly, Nerezim, G\u00f6kle\u0148, Salyr, Saryk, \u00c4rsary and \u00c7owdur. The Russian dialect is Trukhmen. The Teke dialect is sometimes (especially in [[Afghanistan]]) referred to as \"Chagatai\", but like all Turkmen dialects it reflects only a limited influence from classical [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]].\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Turkmen alphabet}}\nOfficially, Turkmen is rendered in the \u201cT\u00e4ze Elipbi\u00fd\u201d or \u201cNew Alphabet\u201d, which is based on the [[Latin alphabet]]. Many political parties in opposition to the [[authoritarian]] rule of President [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] continued to use the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] on websites and publications, most likely to distance themselves from the alphabet that Niyazov created.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018|reason=}}\n\nBefore 1929, Turkmen was written in an [[Arabic script|Arabic alphabet]]. In 1929\u20131938 a Latin alphabet replaced it and then the Cyrillic alphabet was used from 1938 to 1991. In 1991, the current Latin alphabet was introduced, although the transition to it has been rather slow. It used to use some unusual letters, such as the pound, dollar, yen and cent signs, but these were replaced by more conventional letter symbols.{{clarification|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Phonology ==\nThe following phonemes are present in the Turkmen language:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Grammatical sketch of Turkmen|last=Hoey|first=Elliott|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nTurkmen contains both short and long vowels. Doubling the duration of sound for a short vowel is generally how its long vowel counterpart is pronounced. Turkmen employs vowel harmony, a principle that is common in fellow Turkic languages. Vowels and their sounds are as follows:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|\n!colspan=2 | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n!colspan=2 | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|- style=\"vertical-align: center; font-size: x-small; height: 3em\"\n!unrounded\n!rounded\n!unrounded\n!rounded\n|-\n![[Close vowel|Close]]\n|i/\u0438 {{IPA|/\u026a/}}<br>i/\u0438 {{IPA|/\u026a\u02d0/}}\n|\u00fc/\u04af {{IPA|/\u028f/}}<br>\u00fc\u00fd/\u04af\u0439 {{IPA|/\u028f\u02d0/}}\n|y/\u044b {{IPA|/\u026f/}}<br>y/\u044b {{IPA|/\u026f\u02d0/}}\n|u/\u0443 {{IPA|/\u028a/}}<br>u/\u0443 {{IPA|/\u028a\u02d0/}}\n|-\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|e/\u0435 {{IPA|/\u025b/}}\n|\u00f6/\u04e9 {{IPA|/\u0153/}}<br>\u00f6/\u04e9 {{IPA|/\u0153\u02d0/}}\n|\n|o/\u043e {{IPA|/o/}}<br>o/\u043e {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}\n|-\n![[Open vowel|Open]]\n|\u00e4/\u04d9 {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}}\n|\n|a/\u0430 {{IPA|/\u0251/}}<br>a/\u0430 {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}}\n|\n|}\n\n#\n\n=== Consonants ===\nTurkmen consonant phonemes (shown with the letters of the Turkmen alphabet used to represent them):\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!colspan=2|\n!colspan=2|[[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n!colspan=2|[[Dental consonant|Dental]]/<br>[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!colspan=2|[[Postalveolar consonant|Postalv.]]<br>/[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!colspan=2|[[Dorsal consonant|Dorsal]]<br>/[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!colspan=2|[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|style=border-right:0|m/\u043c||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|m}}/}}\n|style=border-right:0|n/\u043d||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|n}}/}}\n|colspan=2|\n|style=border-right:0|\u0148/\u04a3||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|\u014b}}/}}\n|-\n!rowspan=2|[[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]/<br>[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiceless]]\n|style=border-right:0|p/\u043f||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|p}}/}}\n|style=border-right:0|t/\u0442||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|t}}/}}\n|style=border-right:0|\u00e7/\u0447||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|t\u0361\u0283}}/}}\n|style=border-right:0|k/\u043a||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|k}}/}}\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]\n|style=border-right:0|b/\u0431||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|b}}/}}\n|style=border-right:0|d/\u0434||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|d}}/}}\n|style=border-right:0|j/\u0497||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|d\u0361\u0292}}/}}\n|style=border-right:0|g/\u0433||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|\u0261}}/}}\n|-\n!rowspan=2|[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiceless]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|style=border-right:0|s/\u0441||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|\u03b8}}/}}\n|style=border-right:0|\u015f/\u0448||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|\u0283}}/}}\n|style=border-right:0|h/\u0445||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|h}}/}}\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|style=border-right:0|z/\u0437||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|\u00f0}}/}}\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n!colspan=2|[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|style=border-right:0|w/\u0432||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|w}}/}}\n|style=border-right:0|l/\u043b||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|l}}/}}\n|style=border-right:0|\u00fd/\u0439||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|j}}/}}\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n!colspan=2|[[Rhotic consonant|Rhotic]]\n|colspan=2|\n|style=border-right:0|r/\u0440||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|/{{IPAlink|\u027e}}/}}\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|}\nNote that s/\u0441 and z/\u0437 represent {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} and {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}, which are not {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}}, a unique feature among the Turkic languages (cf. ''[[ceceo]]'' in some Spanish dialects).\n\n=== Vowel harmony ===\nLike other Turkic languages, Turkmen is characterized by [[vowel harmony]]. In general, words of native origin consist either entirely of front vowels (in\u00e7e \u00e7ekimli sesler) or entirely of back vowels (\u00fdogyn \u00e7ekimli sesler). Prefixes and suffixes reflect this harmony, taking different forms depending on the word to which they are attached.\n\nThe infinitive form of a verb determines whether it will follow a front vowel harmony or back vowel harmony. Words of foreign origin, mainly Russian, Persian, or Arabic, do not follow vowel harmony.\n\n==Grammar ==\n\n=== Verbs ===\n[[Verbs]] are [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] for singular and plural number and first, second, and third persons. There are 11 verb tenses: <!--oh my god. Can someone please expand this section to make a bit of sense out of those 11 tenses?-->present comprehensive (long and short form), present perfect (regular and negative), future certain, future indefinite, conditional, past definite, obligatory, imperative, and intentional.\n\nThere are two types of verbs in Turkmen, distinguished by their infinitive forms: those ending in the suffix \"-mak\" and those ending in \"-mek\". -Mak verbs follow back vowel harmony, whereas -mek verbs follow front vowel harmony.\n\n====Evidentiality====\nEvidentiality of a reported event is determined by four markers, affixed to the finite verb, roughly:\n\n*-dY (Direct evidence)\n*-(Y)p-dYr (Hearsay)\n*-dYr-mY-n\u00e4m (Indirect evidence)\n*-mY\u015f (Rumoured that)\n\nHere ''Y'' represents the close vowel conforming to vowel harmony.\n \nSome independent particles may be said to convey evidentiality: one such word is the particle ''eken''.\n\n:'''1.''' Aman syrkawla-p-dyr.\n Aman become sick-EV-COP\n            (I heard that) Aman is sick.(information is \"hearsay\")\n\n::Compare 1 with 2.a and 2.b:\n\n:'''2.a.'''

The speaker saw Ben eat the cookies (direct evidence).\n\n::ii. Ben told the speaker that he ate the cookies.\n\n:'''5.''' Ben sen-i\u0148      k\u00f6ke-ler-i\u0148-i                   i\u00fd-ip-dir.\n <nowiki> Ben you-GEN cookie-pl-2sPOSS-ACC eat-EV-COP\n       Ben ate your cookies.</nowiki>\n\n::i. The speaker heard from someone else that Ben ate the cookies (hearsay).\n\n::ii. Generally, the speaker learned through means other than 4.i and 4.ii that Ben ate the cookies.\n\n:'''6.a.''' Ben i\u00fd-ip-dir-mik\u00e4(n)    sen-i\u0148      k\u00f6ke-ler-i\u0148-i.\n <nowiki> Ben eat-EV-COP-EV you-GEN cookie-pl-2sPOSS-ACC\n         Ben ate your cookies, or more loosely: I wonder if Ben ate your cookies.</nowiki>\n\n::i. The speaker saw evidence of the action, i.e. crumbs, and \"made the connection.\" (informant's account)\n\n::ii. The speaker \"doesn't concretely know [Ben] ate them.\" (informant's account)\n\n::iii. In the words of the informant: \"I am questioning myself.  But it's not a question.\"\n\n::iv. In other words: a deduction from indirect evidence, a suspicion\n\n:'''6.b.'''

The speaker questions whether or not s/he has performed an action.\n\n::ii. Evidence of the particular action may be direct, however the nature of its complement (i.e. an item of food) may be in doubt.\n\n:'''7.'''   Ben i\u00fd-en-mi\u015f        sen-i\u0148      k\u00f6ke-ler-i\u0148-i.\n <nowiki> Ben eat-PART be-RUM  you-GEN     cookie-PL-2sPOSS-ACC\n       It is rumoured that Ben ate your cookies.</nowiki>\n\n::i. The action has been passed on via several speakers, or gossiped, similar to in the English gloss.\n\n*Note the postposed complement in 7.  A tree of 7 would look something like {(Ben [{(the one who ate [ti])} must be]) [your cookies]i } using different brackets only in order to make the nesting more obvious.\n*In 6.a., the verb appears in the form i\u00fd-ip-dir-min\u00e4m.  I've analyzed the final two syllables as one evidential particle, glossed as EV.  This follows partly from the intuitions of the informant, and partly from the consistence: it always appears as -min\u00e4m. Nonetheless, it could also be glossed as ...eat-EV-COP-INT-what..., something like, literally, Did Ben eat your cookies, or what?'\n\n====Negation====\nOne way to express negation in Turkmen is with the [[predicative adjective]] \u00fdok, which indicates absence.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n:Onu\u0148 ma\u015fyny \u00fdok.\n:3sg  car-GEN  NEGV\n:'He does not have a car.'\n\n:\u00d6\u00fdde Amandan ba\u015fga adam \u00fdok.\n:houseLOC  AmanINST  except  person  NEGV\n:'There is no one but Aman in the house.'\n\nThe phonetically similar suffix -ok is another option: it attaches to the verb which it negates.  It comes after the stem and before the tense suffix.  -Ok does not modify its form due to vowel harmony.  In addition to -ok there is another suffix -me or -ma.  It appears -mV is used when dealing with one event, -ok for more habitual or lasting states:\n\n:Men bilemok.  'I don't know.'\n:Men bilemokdym.  'I didn't know (for a long time).'\n:Men bilmedim.  'I didn't know (on one occasion).'\n\n(These correspond to the positive forms 'Men bily\u00e4rin', 'Men bily\u00e4rdim', and 'Men bildim.')\n\n:Ol ajyganok.\n:3sg to hunger-GERUND-NEG\n::Literally <nowiki>*'He is not hungering'; in grammatical English, 'He is not hungry.'</nowiki>  (compare to d\u00e4l construction below)\n\nSpeakers of Eastern dialects of Turkmen, influenced by Uzbek, are less likely to utilize the -ok suffix.\n\nYet another way of expressing negation is by the negative particle d\u00e4l.\n\n:Men \u015fu kitaby okamaly d\u00e4l.\n:1sg this book-ACC read-OBLIG NEG\n:I do not have to read this book. or, I should not read this book.

It has an estimated five million native speakers in Turkmenistan, a further 719,000 speakers in Northeastern [[Iran]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/IR/status|title=Iran|website=Ethnologue}}</ref> and 1.5 million people in Northwestern [[Afghanistan]].<ref name=e18>{{Ethnologue18|tuk}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many [[Iranian Turkmen|Iranian]] \"Turkmen\" are speakers of [[Khorasani Turkic language|Khorasani Turkic]]. Moreover, [[Iraqi Turkmen|Iraqi]] and [[Syrian Turkmen|Syrian]] \"Turkmen\" speak dialects that form a [[dialect continuum|continuum]] between [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], in both cases heavily influenced by [[Arabic]]. These three varieties are not Turkmen in the sense of this article.\n\n== Classification ==\nTurkmen is a member of the East Oghuz branch of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic family]] of languages; its closest relatives being Turkish and Azerbaijani, with which it shares a relatively high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].\n\nTurkmen has [[vowel harmony]], is [[agglutinative]] and has no grammatical gender. Word order is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]].\n\nWritten Turkmen today is based on the Teke (Tekke) dialect. The other dialects are Nohurly, \u00ddomud, \u00c4newli, Hasarly, Nerezim, G\u00f6kle\u0148, Salyr, Saryk, \u00c4rsary and \u00c7owdur. The Russian dialect is Trukhmen. The Teke dialect is sometimes (especially in [[Afghanistan]]) referred to as \"Chagatai\", but like all Turkmen dialects it reflects only a limited influence from classical [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]].\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Turkmen alphabet}}\nOfficially, Turkmen is rendered in the \u201cT\u00e4ze Elipbi\u00fd\u201d or \u201cNew Alphabet\u201d, which is based on the [[Latin alphabet]]. Many political parties in opposition to the [[authoritarian]] rule of President [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] continued to use the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] on websites and publications, most likely to distance themselves from the alphabet that Niyazov created.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018|reason=}}\n\nBefore 1929, Turkmen was written in an [[Arabic script|Arabic alphabet]]. In 1929\u20131938 a Latin alphabet replaced it and then the Cyrillic alphabet was used from 1938 to 1991. In 1991, the current Latin alphabet was introduced, although the transition to it has been rather slow.

Doubling the duration of sound for a short vowel is generally how its long vowel counterpart is pronounced. Turkmen employs vowel harmony, a principle that is common in fellow Turkic languages.

''[[ceceo]]'' in some Spanish dialects).\n\n=== Vowel harmony ===\nLike other Turkic languages, Turkmen is characterized by [[vowel harmony]]. In general, words of native origin consist either entirely of front vowels (in\u00e7e \u00e7ekimli sesler) or entirely of back vowels (\u00fdogyn \u00e7ekimli sesler). Prefixes and suffixes reflect this harmony, taking different forms depending on the word to which they are attached.\n\nThe infinitive form of a verb determines whether it will follow a front vowel harmony or back vowel harmony. Words of foreign origin, mainly Russian, Persian, or Arabic, do not follow vowel harmony.\n\n==Grammar ==\n\n=== Verbs ===\n[[Verbs]] are [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] for singular and plural number and first, second, and third persons. There are 11 verb tenses: <!--oh my god. Can someone please expand this section to make a bit of sense out of those 11 tenses?-->present comprehensive (long and short form), present perfect (regular and negative), future certain, future indefinite, conditional, past definite, obligatory, imperative, and intentional.\n\nThere are two types of verbs in Turkmen, distinguished by their infinitive forms: those ending in the suffix \"-mak\" and those ending in \"-mek\". -Mak verbs follow back vowel harmony, whereas -mek verbs follow front vowel harmony.\n\n====Evidentiality====\nEvidentiality of a reported event is determined by four markers, affixed to the finite verb, roughly:\n\n*-dY (Direct evidence)\n*-(Y)p-dYr (Hearsay)\n*-dYr-mY-n\u00e4m (Indirect evidence)\n*-mY\u015f (Rumoured that)\n\nHere ''Y'' represents the close vowel conforming to vowel harmony.\n \nSome independent particles may be said to convey evidentiality: one such word is the particle ''eken''.\n\n:'''1.''' Aman syrkawla-p-dyr.\n Aman become sick-EV-COP\n            (I heard that) Aman is sick.(information is \"hearsay\")\n\n::Compare 1 with 2.a and 2.b:\n\n:'''2.a.''' Aman syrkawla-dy.\n Aman  become sick-3sPAST\n\n:'''2.b.''' Aman syrkaw.\n Aman sick.\n                 Aman is sick. (speaker has spoken with Aman)\n\n:'''3.''' Maral A\u015fgabat-dan    gel-ip-dir.\n <nowiki> Maral Ashgabat-ABL come-EV-COP\n                (I heard that) Maral came from Ashgabat.\n </nowiki>\n\n:'''4.'''

The speaker saw Ben eat the cookies (direct evidence).\n\n::ii. Ben told the speaker that he ate the cookies.\n\n:'''5.''' Ben sen-i\u0148      k\u00f6ke-ler-i\u0148-i                   i\u00fd-ip-dir.\n <nowiki> Ben you-GEN cookie-pl-2sPOSS-ACC eat-EV-COP\n       Ben ate your cookies.</nowiki>\n\n::i. The speaker heard from someone else that Ben ate the cookies (hearsay).\n\n::ii. Generally, the speaker learned through means other than 4.i and 4.ii that Ben ate the cookies.\n\n:'''6.a.''' Ben i\u00fd-ip-dir-mik\u00e4(n)    sen-i\u0148      k\u00f6ke-ler-i\u0148-i.\n <nowiki> Ben eat-EV-COP-EV you-GEN cookie-pl-2sPOSS-ACC\n         Ben ate your cookies, or more loosely: I wonder if Ben ate your cookies.</nowiki>\n\n::i. The speaker saw evidence of the action, i.e. crumbs, and \"made the connection.\" (informant's account)\n\n::ii. The speaker \"doesn't concretely know [Ben] ate them.\" (informant's account)\n\n::iii. In the words of the informant: \"I am questioning myself.  But it's not a question.\"\n\n::iv. In other words: a deduction from indirect evidence, a suspicion\n\n:'''6.b.''' Men (...) i\u00fd-ip-dir-in-mik\u00e4m?\n <nowiki>  I    (...)   eat-EV-1sPRES(?)-EV\n           Did I eat something?</nowiki>\n\n::i. The speaker questions whether or not s/he has performed an action.\n\n::ii. Evidence of the particular action may be direct, however the nature of its complement (i.e. an item of food) may be in doubt.\n\n:'''7.'''   Ben i\u00fd-en-mi\u015f        sen-i\u0148      k\u00f6ke-ler-i\u0148-i.\n <nowiki> Ben eat-PART be-RUM  you-GEN     cookie-PL-2sPOSS-ACC\n       It is rumoured that Ben ate your cookies.</nowiki>\n\n::i. The action has been passed on via several speakers, or gossiped, similar to in the English gloss.\n\n*Note the postposed complement in 7.  A tree of 7 would look something like {(Ben [{(the one who ate [ti])} must be]) [your cookies]i } using different brackets only in order to make the nesting more obvious.\n*In 6.a., the verb appears in the form i\u00fd-ip-dir-min\u00e4m.  I've analyzed the final two syllables as one evidential particle, glossed as EV.  This follows partly from the intuitions of the informant, and partly from the consistence: it always appears as -min\u00e4m. Nonetheless, it could also be glossed as ...eat-EV-COP-INT-what..., something like, literally, Did Ben eat your cookies, or what?'\n\n====Negation====\nOne way to express negation in Turkmen is with the [[predicative adjective]] \u00fdok, which indicates absence.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n:Onu\u0148 ma\u015fyny \u00fdok.\n:3sg  car-GEN  NEGV\n:'He does not have a car.'\n\n:\u00d6\u00fdde Amandan ba\u015fga adam \u00fdok.\n:houseLOC  AmanINST  except  person  NEGV\n:'There is no one but Aman in the house.'\n\nThe phonetically similar suffix -ok is another option: it attaches to the verb which it negates.  It comes after the stem and before the tense suffix.  -Ok does not modify its form due to vowel harmony.  In addition to -ok there is another suffix -me or -ma.  It appears -mV is used when dealing with one event, -ok for more habitual or lasting states:\n\n:Men bilemok.  'I don't know.'\n:Men bilemokdym.  'I didn't know (for a long time).'\n:Men bilmedim.  'I didn't know (on one occasion).'\n\n(These correspond to the positive forms 'Men bily\u00e4rin', 'Men bily\u00e4rdim', and 'Men bildim.')\n\n:Ol ajyganok.\n:3sg to hunger-GERUND-NEG\n::Literally <nowiki>*'He is not hungering'; in grammatical English, 'He is not hungry.'</nowiki>  (compare to d\u00e4l construction below)\n\nSpeakers of Eastern dialects of Turkmen, influenced by Uzbek, are less likely to utilize the -ok suffix.\n\nYet another way of expressing negation is by the negative particle d\u00e4l.\n\n:Men \u015fu kitaby okamaly d\u00e4l.\n:1sg this book-ACC read-OBLIG NEG\n:I do not have to read this book. or, I should not read this book.  (sentence was elicited for the latter meaning)\n\n:Ol a\u00e7 d\u00e4l.\n:3sg hungry NEG  (note the lack of copula)\n:He is not hungry.\n\n:Kofe gyzgyn bolup biler.\n:The coffee might be hot.\n\n:Kofe gyzgyn d\u00e4l bolup biler.\n:The coffee might not be hot.\n\n:Kofe gyzgyn d\u00e4lmi?\n:Isn't the coffee hot?\n\nThere is not an equivalent in Turkmen to the English prefix 'un-'.  That is, one can't simply attach an affix to a verb to indicate the opposite action, as in wrap the present \u2192 unwrap the present.\n\nIt appears that different tenses use different forms of negation, as in the following sentences:\n\n:Men ylgamok.\n:I am not running. (present)\n\n:Men ylgamadym.\n:I did not run.  (past)\n\n:Men ylgajak d\u00e4l.\n:I will not run.  (definite future)\n\n====Turkmen case system====\n\nTurkmen has six cases: Accusative, Dative, Genitive, Instrumental, Locative, and Nominative.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Lockheed team chose twin booms to accommodate the tail assembly, engines, and turbo-superchargers, with a central nacelle for the pilot and armament. The XP-38 gondola mockup was designed to mount two .50-caliber (12.7&nbsp;mm) [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s with 200&nbsp;rounds per gun (rpg), two .30-caliber (7.62&nbsp;mm) Brownings with 500&nbsp;rpg, and a T1 Army Ordnance 23&nbsp;mm (.90 in) [[autocannon]] with a rotary magazine as a substitute for the non-existent 25&nbsp;mm [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Hotchkiss]] aircraft autocannon specified by Kelsey and Saville.<ref>Bodie 2001, p. 19.</ref> In the YP-38s, a [[M4 cannon|37 mm (1.46 in) M9 autocannon]] with 15 rounds replaced the T1.<ref>Bodie 2001, p. 44.</ref> The 15 rounds were in three five-round clips, an unsatisfactory arrangement according to Kelsey, and the M9 did not perform reliably in flight.

Note the yoke, rather than the more-usual stick.]]\n\nTest flights revealed problems initially believed to be tail [[Wing flutter|flutter]]. During high-speed flight approaching Mach&nbsp;0.68, especially during dives, the aircraft's tail would begin to shake violently and the nose would tuck under (see [[Mach tuck]]), steepening the dive. Once caught in this dive, the fighter would enter a high-speed [[Mach tuck|compressibility stall]] and the controls would lock up, leaving the pilot no option but to bail out (if possible) or remain with the aircraft until it got down to denser air, where he might have a chance to pull out. During a test flight in May 1941, USAAC Major Signa Gilkey managed to stay with a YP-38 in a compressibility lockup, riding it out until he recovered gradually using [[Trim tab|elevator trim]].<ref name=\"Aviation Museum\"/> Lockheed engineers were very concerned at this limitation but first had to concentrate on filling the current order of aircraft. [[1941 in aviation#June|In late June 1941]], the Army Air Corps was renamed the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), and a total of 65 Lightnings were finished for the service by September 1941 with more on the way for the USAAF, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), and the Free French Air Force operating from England.\n\nBy November 1941, many of the initial assembly-line challenges had been met, which freed up time for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had a few ideas for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded servo tabs on the elevator trailing edge designed to aid the pilot when control yoke forces rose over {{convert|30|lb-f|N}}, as would be expected in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot's actions. The expert test pilot, 43-year-old<ref>[http://eugenedownes.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/greatpilot.jpg \"Ralph Virden obituary.\"] ''eugenedownes.tripod.com.'' Retrieved: 10 October 2010.</ref> Ralph Virden, was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes, since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about {{convert|3500|ft|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that servo tabs were ''not'' the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the Army Air Forces personnel were sure it was flutter and ordered Lockheed to look more closely at the tail.\n\nIn 1941 flutter was a familiar engineering problem related to a too-flexible tail, but the P-38's [[empennage]] was completely skinned in aluminum{{refn|\"Sheet Metal Repair to the P-38 Lightning\", original Lockheed training film, from TM Technologies showes skinning and repair.|group=Note}} rather than fabric and was quite rigid. At no time did the P-38 suffer from true flutter.<ref name=\"Bodie p. 58\">Bodie 2001, p. 58.</ref> To prove a point, one elevator and its vertical stabilizers were skinned with metal 63% thicker than standard, but the increase in rigidity made no difference in vibration. Army [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Kenneth B. Wolfe (head of Army Production Engineering) asked Lockheed to try external mass balances above and below the elevator, though the P-38 already had large mass balances elegantly placed within each vertical stabilizer. Various configurations of external mass balances were equipped, and dangerously steep test flights were flown to document their performance. Explaining to Wolfe in Report No. 2414, Kelly Johnson wrote \"the violence of the vibration was unchanged and the diving tendency was naturally the same for all conditions.\"<ref>Bodie 2001, p. 57.</ref> The external mass balances did not help at all. Nonetheless, at Wolfe's insistence, the additional external balances were a feature of every P-38 built from then on.<ref name=\"Baugher YP-38\">Baugher, Joe.

They already had experience of models thrashing around violently at speeds approaching those requested and did not want to risk damaging their tunnel. Gen. Arnold, head of Army Air Forces, ordered them to run the tests, which were done up to Mach 0.74.<ref>Erikson, Albert L. \"Wind-Tunnel Investigation of Devices for Improving The Diving Characteristics of Airplanes.\" ''NACA MR No. 3F12, Summary''.</ref> The P-38's dive problem was revealed to be the [[center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] moving back toward the tail when in high-speed airflow. The solution was to change the geometry of the wing's lower surface when diving in order to keep lift within bounds of the top of the wing. In February 1943, quick-acting dive flaps were tried and proven by Lockheed test pilots. The dive flaps were installed outboard of the engine nacelles, and in action they extended downward 35\u00b0 in 1.5 seconds. The flaps did not act as a speed brake; they affected the pressure distribution in a way that retained the wing's lift.<ref>Bodie 2001, pp. 174\u2013175.</ref>\n\nLate in 1943, a few hundred dive flap field modification kits were assembled to give North African, European and Pacific P-38s a chance to withstand compressibility and expand their combat tactics. Unfortunately, these crucial flaps did not always reach their destination. In March 1944, 200 dive flap kits intended for [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO) P-38Js were destroyed in a mistaken [[identification friend or foe|identification]] incident in which an RAF fighter shot down the [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]] (mistaken for an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200|Fw 200]]) taking the shipment to England. Back in Burbank, P-38Js coming off the assembly line in spring 1944 were towed out to the ramp and modified in the open air. The flaps were finally incorporated into the production line in June 1944 on the last 210 P-38Js. Despite testing having proved the dive flaps effective in improving tactical maneuvers, a 14-month delay in production limited their implementation, with only the final half of all Lightnings built having the dive flaps installed as an assembly-line sequence.<ref>Ethell et al. 1984, p. 14.</ref>\n\nJohnson later recalled:\n{{quote|I broke an ulcer over compressibility on the P-38 because we flew into a speed range where no one had ever been before, and we had difficulty convincing people that it wasn't the funny-looking airplane itself, but a fundamental physical problem. We found out what happened when the Lightning shed its tail and we worked during the whole war to get 15 more kn [28&nbsp;km/h] of speed out of the P-38. We saw compressibility as a brick wall for a long time. Then we learned how to get through it.<ref>Goebel, Greg. [https://web.archive.org/web/20020223121418/http://www.vectorsite.net/avp38.html \"The Lockheed P-38 Lightning.\"] ''vectorsite.net'', Version 1.3. Retrieved: 21 January 2007.</ref>}}\n\n[[Buffeting]] was another early aerodynamic problem. It was difficult to distinguish from compressibility as both were reported by test pilots as \"tail shake\". Buffeting came about from airflow disturbances ahead of the tail; the airplane would shake at high speed. Leading edge wing slots were tried as were combinations of [[fillet (mechanics)|filleting]] between the wing, cockpit and engine nacelles. Air tunnel test number 15 solved the buffeting completely and its fillet solution was fitted to every subsequent P-38 airframe. Fillet kits were sent out to every squadron flying Lightnings. The problem was traced to a 40% increase in air speed at the wing-fuselage junction where the thickness/chord ratio was highest. An airspeed of {{convert|500|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}} could push airflow at the wing-fuselage junction close to the speed of sound. Filleting solved the buffeting problem for the P-38E and later models.<ref name=\"Bodie p. 58\"/>\n\nAnother issue with the P-38 arose from its unique design feature of outwardly rotating (at the \"tops\" of the propeller arcs) counter-rotating propellers. Losing one of two engines in any twin-engine non-[[centerline thrust]] aircraft on takeoff creates sudden drag, yawing the nose toward the dead engine and rolling the wingtip down on the side of the dead engine. Normal training in flying twin-engine aircraft when losing an engine on takeoff is to push the remaining engine to full throttle to maintain airspeed; if a pilot did that in the P-38, regardless of which engine had failed, the resulting engine torque and [[p-factor]] force produced a sudden uncontrollable yawing roll, and the aircraft would flip over and hit the ground. Eventually, procedures were taught to allow a pilot to deal with the situation by reducing power on the running engine, feathering the prop on the failed engine, and then increasing power gradually until the aircraft was in stable flight. Single-engine takeoffs were possible, though not with a full fuel and ammunition load.<ref>Bodie 2001, p. 210.</ref>\n\nThe engines were unusually quiet because the [[Exhaust system|exhausts]] were [[muffler|muffled]] by the [[General Electric]] turbo-superchargers on the twin [[Allison V-1710 engine|Allison V12s]].<ref>Kaplan and Saunders 1991, p. 56.</ref> There were early problems with cockpit temperature regulation; pilots were often too hot in the tropical sun as the canopy could not be fully opened without severe buffeting and were often too cold in northern Europe and at high altitude, as the distance of the engines from the cockpit prevented easy heat transfer. Later variants received modifications (such as electrically heated flight suits) to solve these problems.\n\n[[File:P-38 Lightning at sunset.jpg|left|thumb|P-38 rear view]]\n\nOn 20 September 1939, before the YP-38s had been built and flight tested, the USAAC ordered 66 initial production P-38 Lightnings, 30 of which were delivered to the (re-named) USAAF in mid-1941, but not all these aircraft were armed. The unarmed aircraft were subsequently fitted with four .50 in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns (instead of the two .50 in/12.7&nbsp;mm and two .30 in/7.62&nbsp;mm of their predecessors) and a 37&nbsp;mm (1.46&nbsp;in) cannon.

Aircraft manufacturers understood that they would not be rewarded if they installed subsystems on their fighters to enable them to carry [[drop tank]]s to provide more fuel for extended range. Lieutenant Kelsey, acting against this policy, risked his career in late 1941 when he convinced Lockheed to incorporate such subsystems in the P-38E model, without putting his request in writing. It is possible that Kelsey was responding to Colonel [[George William Goddard]]'s observation that the US sorely needed a high-speed, long-range [[photo reconnaissance]] plane. Along with a [[change order]] specifying some P-38Es be produced without guns but with photo reconnaissance cameras, to be designated the F-4-1-LO, Lockheed began working out the problems of drop tank design and incorporation. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, eventually about 100 P-38Es were sent to a modification center near [[Dallas, Texas]], or to the new Lockheed assembly plant B-6 (today the [[Burbank Airport]]), to be fitted with four K-17 [[aerial photography]] cameras. All of these aircraft were also modified to be able to carry drop tanks. P-38Fs were modified as well. Every Lightning from the P-38G onward was capable of being fitted with drop tanks straight off the assembly line.<ref name=Bodie89>Bodie 2001, pp. 89\u201391.</ref>\n\nIn March 1942, General Arnold made an off-hand comment that the US could avoid the [[Battle of the Atlantic|German U-boat menace]] by flying fighters to the UK (rather than packing them onto ships). [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] pressed the point, emphasizing his interest in the solution. Arnold was likely aware of the flying radius extension work being done on the P-38, which by this time had seen success with small drop tanks in the range of {{convert|150|to|165|gal|L|abbr=on}}, the difference in capacity being the result of subcontractor production variation. Arnold ordered further tests with larger drop tanks in the range of {{convert|300|to|310|gal|L|abbr=on}}; the results were reported by Kelsey as providing the P-38 with a {{convert|2500|mi|km|adj=on}} ferrying range.<ref name=Bodie89/> Because of available supply, the smaller drop tanks were used to fly Lightnings to the UK, the plan called [[Operation Bolero]].\n\nLed by two [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]es, the first seven P-38s, each carrying two small drop tanks, left [[Presque Isle International Airport|Presque Isle Army Air Field]] on 23 June 1942 for [[RAF Heathfield]] in Scotland. Their first refueling stop was made in far northeast Canada at [[CFB Goose Bay|Goose Bay]]. The second stop was a rough airstrip in Greenland called [[Narsarsuaq Air Base|Bluie West One]], and the third refueling stop was in [[Iceland]] at [[Naval Air Station Keflavik|Keflavik]]. Other P-38s followed this route with some lost in mishaps, usually due to poor weather, low visibility, radio difficulties and navigational errors. Nearly 200 of the P-38Fs (and a few modified Es) were successfully flown across the Atlantic in July\u2013August 1942, making the P-38 the first USAAF fighter to reach Britain and the first fighter ever to be delivered across the Atlantic under its own power.<ref>McFarland and Newton 1991, p. 103.</ref> Kelsey himself piloted one of the Lightnings, landing in Scotland on 25 July.<ref>Bodie 2001, pp. 101\u2013102.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Lockheed P-38 Lightnings on CVE.jpg|thumb|Cocooned Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and North American Aviation P-51 Mustangs line the decks of a U.S. Navy Escort \"Jeep\" Carrier (CVE) ready for shipment to Europe from New York.]]\n\nThe first unit to receive P-38s was the [[1st Operations Group#1st Fighter Group in World War II|1st Fighter Group]].

The Aleutians were one of the most rugged environments available for testing the new aircraft under combat conditions. More Lightnings were lost due to severe weather and other conditions than enemy action; there were cases where Lightning pilots, mesmerized by flying for hours over gray seas under gray skies, simply flew into the water. On 9 August 1942, two P-38Es of the 343rd Fighter Group, [[Eleventh Air Force|11th Air Force]], at the end of a {{convert|1000|mi|km}} long-range patrol, happened upon a pair of Japanese [[Kawanishi H6K]] \"Mavis\" flying boats and destroyed them,<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> making them the first Japanese aircraft to be shot down by Lightnings.\n\n===European theater===\n====North Africa and Italy====\n[[File:Lockheed F-5 Lightning.jpg|left|thumb|Reconnaissance P-38 with bold black and white [[invasion stripes]] participating in the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy Campaign]]]]\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Midway]], the USAAF began redeploying fighter groups to Britain as part of Operation Bolero and Lightnings of the 1st Fighter Group were flown across the Atlantic via [[Iceland]].

The Lightning's long range allowed the pilots to fly their fighters over the [[Bay of Biscay]], skirting neutral Spain and Portugal to refuel in Morocco. The P-38s were initially based at [[Oran Tafraoui Airport|Tafaroui airfield]] in Algeria alongside [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Warhawks]] and the rest of the 12th Air Force. P-38s were first involved in North African combat operations on 11 November 1942. The first North African P-38 kill was on 22 November when Lieutenant Mark Shipman of the 14th downed an Italian airplane with twin engines. Shipman later made two more kills: a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter and a very large [[Messerschmitt Me 323|Me 323 ''Gigant'']] transport.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 71\">Stanaway 2014, p. 71.</ref>\n\nEarly results in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] were mixed. Some P-38 pilots scored multiple kills to become aces, while many others were shot down due to inexperience or tactical strictures. Overall, the P-38 suffered its highest losses in the Mediterranean Theater. The primary function of the P-38 in North Africa was to escort bombers,<ref name=\"Blake 2012, p. 14\">Blake 2012, p. 14</ref> but the fighters also targeted transport aircraft, and later in the campaign they were sometimes tasked with ground attack missions. When tied to bomber escort duties, the P-38 squadrons were vulnerable to attack from above by German fighters who selected the most advantageous position and timing. The ineffectual early tactical doctrine of the American units required the P-38s to fly near the bombers at all times rather than to defend aggressively or to fly ahead and clear the airspace for the bombers, and many American pilots were downed because of this limitation. Losses mounted, and all available P-38s in the UK were flown to North Africa to restore squadron strength.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 71\"/> After this painful experience, the American leadership changed tactics, and in February 1943 the P-38 was given free rein in its battles.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 72\">Stanaway 2014, p. 72.</ref>\n\nThe first German success against the P-38 was on 28 November when Bf 109 pilots of [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] claimed seven Lightnings for no loss of their own.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 72\"/> Further one-sided German victories were noted on several occasions through January 1943.<ref>Bergstrom 2019, pp. 315\u2013316.</ref> The first P-38 pilots to achieve ace status were Virgil Smith of the 14th FG and [[Jack M. Ilfrey|Jack Illfrey]] of the 1st FG, both credited with five wins by 26 December. Smith got a sixth enemy aircraft on 28 December but was killed two days later in a crash landing, likely after taking fire from ''Oberfeldwebel'' [[Herbert Rollwage]] of JG 53 who survived the war with at least 71 kills. This was Rollwage's first victory over a P-38, and his 35th claim at the time.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 73\">Stanaway 2014, p. 73.</ref>\n\nThe two squadrons of the 14th Fighter Group were reduced so badly in December that the 82nd FG was flown from the UK to North Africa to cover the shortage. The first kill by the 82nd was during a bomber escort mission on 7 January 1943 when William J. \"Dixie\" Sloan broke formation and turned toward six attacking Bf 109s to shoot one of them down. Known for his maverick style, Sloan racked up 12 victories by July 1943.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 73\"/> After another heavy toll in January 1943, 14th FG had to be withdrawn from the front to reorganize, with surviving pilots sent home and the few remaining Lightnings transferred to the 82nd.<ref name=\"Blake 2012, p. 14\"/> The 14th was out of action for three months, returning in May.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 74\">Stanaway 2014, p. 74.</ref>\n\nOn 5 April 1943, 26 P-38Fs of the 82nd claimed 31 enemy aircraft destroyed, helping to establish air superiority in the area and earning it the German nickname \"''der Gabelschwanz Teufel''\"&nbsp;\u2013 the Fork-Tailed Devil.<ref name=\"Baugher European\"/> The P-38 remained active in the Mediterranean for the rest of the war, continuing to deliver and receive damage in combat. On 25 August 1943, 13 P-38s were shot down in a single sortie by JG 53 Bf 109s.<ref name=\"Scutts p.61\">Scutts 1994, p. 61.</ref> On 2 September, 10 P-38s were shot down, in return for losing one German pilot: 67-victory ace [[Franz Schie\u00df]] who had been the leading \"Lightning\" killer in the Luftwaffe with 17 destroyed.<ref name=\"Scutts p.61\"/>\n\nThe Mediterranean Theater saw the first aerial combat between German fighters and P-38s. German fighter pilot appraisal of the P-38 was mixed. Some observers dismissed the P-38 as an easy kill while others gave it high praise, a deadly enemy worthy of respect. [[Johannes Steinhoff]], commander of JG 77 in North Africa, said that the unit's old Bf 109s were \"perhaps, a little faster\" than the P-38, but a dogfight with the twin-engined fighter was daunting because its turning radius was much smaller, and it could quickly get on the tail of the Bf 109. [[Franz Stigler]], an ace with 28 kills, flew Bf 109s against the P-38 in North Africa. Stigler said the Lightning \"could turn inside us with ease and they could go from level flight to climb almost instantaneously. We lost quite a few pilots who tried to make an attack and then pull up... One cardinal rule we never forgot was: avoid fighting the P-38 head on. That was suicide.\" Stigler said the best defense was to flick-roll the Bf 109 and dive, as the Lightning was slow in the first 10 degrees of roll, and it was not as fast in a dive.<ref name=\"Laurier 2016, p. 54.\">Laurier 2016, p. 54.</ref> [[Herbert Kaiser]], eventually a 68-kill ace, shot down his first P-38 in January 1943. Kaiser said that the P-38 should be respected as a formidable opponent, that it was faster and more maneuverable than the Bf 109G-6 model he flew, especially since the G-6 was slowed by underwing cannon pods. [[Johann Pichler]], another high-scoring ace, said that the P-38 in 1943 was much faster in a climb than the Bf 109.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 74\"/> [[Kurt B\u00fchligen]], third-highest scoring German pilot on the Western front with 112 victories, recalled: \"The P-38 fighter (and the B-24) were easy to burn.

''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' chief test pilot ''colonnello'' (Lieutenant Colonel) Angelo Tondi flew the aircraft to [[Guidonia Montecelio|Guidonia]] airfield where the P-38G was evaluated. On 11 August 1943, Tondi took off to intercept a formation of about 50 bombers, returning from the bombing of [[Terni]] ([[Umbria]]). Tondi attacked B-17G \"Bonny Sue\", s.n. 42-30307, that fell off the shore of [[Torvaianica]], near [[Rome]], while six airmen parachuted out. According to US sources, he also damaged three more bombers on that occasion. On 4 September, the 301st BG reported the loss of B-17 \"The Lady Evelyn,\" s.n. 42-30344, downed by \"an enemy P-38\".<ref name=\"Garello p. 68.\">''Garello'' 2007, p. 68.</ref> War missions for that plane were limited, as the Italian petrol was too corrosive for the Lockheed's tanks.<ref name=\"Dimensione cielo p. 72.\">''Dimensione cielo'' 1973, p. 72.</ref> Other Lightnings were eventually acquired by Italy for postwar service.\n\nIn a particular case when faced by more agile fighters at low altitudes in a constricted valley, Lightnings suffered heavy losses. On the morning of 10 June 1944, 96 P-38Js of the 1st and 82nd Fighter Groups took off from Italy for [[Ploie\u0219ti]], the third-most heavily defended target in Europe, after [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]].<ref name=Cesarani/> Instead of bombing from high altitude as had been tried by the [[Fifteenth Air Force#Oil Industry Targets|Fifteenth Air Force]], USAAF planning had determined that a dive-bombing surprise attack, beginning at about {{convert|7000|ft|m|-2}} with bomb release at or below {{convert|3000|ft|m|-2}},<ref name=Cesarani>Cesarani and Kavanaugh 2004, pp. 234\u2013235.</ref> performed by 46 [[82d Operations Group|82nd Fighter Group]] P-38s, each carrying one {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|adj=on}} bomb, would yield more accurate results.<ref name=\"Stanaway ETO/MTO\">Stanaway 1998, pp.&nbsp;43\u201346.</ref> All of [[1st Operations Group#Italian operations|1st Fighter Group]] and a few aircraft in 82nd Fighter Group were to fly cover, and all fighters were to strafe targets of opportunity on the return trip; a distance of some {{convert|1255|mi|km|-1}}, including a circuitous outward route made in an attempt to achieve surprise.<ref name=Cesarani/>\n\nSome 85 or 86 fighters arrived in Romania to find enemy airfields alerted, with a wide assortment of aircraft scrambling for safety. P-38s shot down several, including [[heavy fighter]]s, transports and observation aircraft. At Ploie\u0219ti, defense forces were fully alert, the target was concealed by [[smoke screen]], and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] was very heavy, seven Lightnings were lost to anti-aircraft fire at the target, and two more during strafing attacks on the return flight. German Bf&nbsp;109 fighters from I./JG 53 and 2./JG 77 fought the Americans. Sixteen aircraft of the [[71st Fighter Squadron]] were challenged by a large formation of Romanian single-seater [[IAR 80#IAR.81|IAR.81C]] fighters.

Test pilot Captain [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]], [[Fleet Air Arm]], recalled:\n\n<blockquote>We had found out that the Bf&nbsp;109 and the FW&nbsp;190 could fight up to a Mach of 0.75, three-quarters the speed of sound. We checked the Lightning and it couldn't fly in combat faster than 0.68. So it was useless. We told Doolittle that all it was good for was photo-reconnaissance and had to be withdrawn from escort duties. And the funny thing is that the Americans had great difficulty understanding this because the Lightning had the two top aces in the Far East.<ref name=\"Thompson with Smith p. 240.\">Thompson with Smith 2008, p. 240.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter evaluation tests at Farnborough, the P-38 was kept in fighting service in Europe for a while longer. Although many failings were remedied with the introduction of the P-38J, by September 1944, all but one of the Lightning groups in the Eighth Air Force had converted to the P-51 Mustang. The Eighth Air Force continued to conduct reconnaissance missions using the F-5 variant.<ref name=\"Baugher European\"/>\n\n===Pacific theater===\n[[File:\"Give us More P-38's\" - NARA - 514398.jpg|thumb|left|Wartime poster encouraging greater production of P-38s]]\n\nThe P-38 was used most extensively and successfully in the Pacific theater, where it proved more suited, combining exceptional range with the reliability of two engines for long missions over water. The P-38 was used in a variety of roles, especially escorting bombers at altitudes of {{convert|18000|\u2013|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The P-38 was credited with destroying more Japanese aircraft than any other USAAF fighter.<ref name=\"Donald\"/> Freezing cockpit temperatures were not a problem at low altitude in the tropics. In fact the cockpit was often too hot since opening a window while in flight caused buffeting by setting up turbulence through the [[tailplane]]. Pilots taking low altitude assignments often flew stripped down to shorts, tennis shoes, and parachute. While the P-38 could not out-turn the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M Zero]] and most other Japanese fighters when flying below {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}, its superior speed coupled with a good rate of climb meant that it could use [[Basic fighter maneuvers#Energy management|energy tactics]], making multiple high-speed passes at its target. In addition, its tightly grouped guns were even more deadly to lightly armored Japanese warplanes than to German aircraft. The concentrated, parallel stream of bullets allowed aerial victory at much longer distances than fighters carrying wing guns. [[Richard Bong|Dick Bong]], the United States' highest-scoring World War II air ace (40 victories in P-38s), flew directly at his targets to ensure he hit them, in some cases flying through the debris of his target (and on one occasion colliding with an enemy aircraft which was claimed as a \"probable\" victory). The twin Allison engines performed admirably in the Pacific.\n\n[[File:Plane-3.jpg|thumb|Col. MacDonald and Al Nelson in the Pacific with MacDonald's P-38J.]]\n\nGeneral [[George C. Kenney]], commander of the USAAF [[Fifth Air Force|5th Air Force]] operating in [[New Guinea]], could not get enough P-38s; they had become his favorite fighter in November 1942 when one squadron, the [[39th Fighter Squadron]] of the 35th Fighter Group, joined his assorted P-39s and P-40s. The Lightnings established local air superiority with their first combat action on 27 December 1942.<ref>Kenney 1997, pp. 171\u2013173.</ref><ref>Hearn 2008, p. 86.</ref><ref>Schom 2004, p. 310.</ref><ref>Stanaway 1997, pp. 7\u20138.</ref><ref>McFarland 1997, p. 33.</ref> Kenney sent repeated requests to Arnold for more P-38s, and was rewarded with occasional shipments, but Europe was a higher priority in Washington.<ref>Bruning 2003, p. 124.</ref> Despite their small force, Lightning pilots began to compete in racking up scores against Japanese aircraft.\n\nOn 2\u20134 March 1943, P-38s flew top cover for 5th Air Force and Australian bombers and attack aircraft during the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], in which eight Japanese troop transports and four escorting destroyers were sunk. Two P-38 aces from the 39th Fighter Squadron were killed on the second day of the battle: Bob Faurot and Hoyt \"Curley\" Eason (a veteran with five victories who had trained hundreds of pilots, including Dick Bong). In one notable engagement on 3 March 1943 P-38s escorted 13 B-17s as they bombed the Japanese convoy from a medium altitude of 7,000 feet which dispersed the convoy formation and reduced their concentrated anti-aircraft firepower. A B-17 was shot down and when Japanese Zero fighters machine-gunned some of the B-17 crew members that bailed out in parachutes, three P-38s promptly engaged and shot down five of the Zeros.<ref name=\"Gillison, pp. 692-693\">Gillison 1962, pp. 692</ref><ref name=\"historynet\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-the-bismarck-sea.htm |title=Battle of the Bismarck Sea  |first=Lawrence |last=Spinetta |date=November 2007 |journal=World War II |issn=0898-4204|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Watson, pp. 144-145\">Watson 1950, pp. 144\u2013145.</ref><ref name=\"Gamble 2010 313\">Gamble 2010, p. 310.</ref>\n\n====Isoroku Yamamoto====\n{{Main|Operation Vengeance}}\nThe Lightning figured in one of the most significant operations in the Pacific theater: the interception, on 18 April 1943, of [[Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], the architect of Japan's naval strategy in the Pacific including the attack on Pearl Harbor. When American [[Cryptanalysis|codebreakers]] found out that he was flying to [[Bougainville Island]] to conduct a front-line inspection, 16 P-38G Lightnings were sent on a long-range fighter-intercept mission, flying {{convert|435|mi|km}} from [[Guadalcanal]] at heights of {{convert|10|\u2013|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the ocean to avoid detection. The Lightnings met Yamamoto's two [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" fast bomber transports and six escorting Zeros just as they arrived at the island. The first Betty crashed in the jungle and the second ditched near the coast. Two Zeros were also claimed by the American fighters with the loss of one P-38. Japanese search parties found Yamamoto's body at the jungle crash site the next day.<ref name=\"Stanaway Pacific\">Stanaway 1997, p. 14.</ref>\n\n===Service record===\n[[File:First Lieutenant H. A. Blood examines ammunition.jpg|thumb|Pilot and aircraft armorer inspect ammunition for the central 20 mm cannon]]\nThe P-38's service record shows mixed results, which may reflect more on its employment than on flaws with the aircraft. The P-38's engine troubles at high altitudes only occurred with the Eighth Air Force. One reason for this was the inadequate cooling systems of the G and H models; the improved P-38 J and L had tremendous success flying out of Italy into Germany at all altitudes.<ref name=\"Baugher European\"/> Until the -J-25 variant, P-38s were easily avoided by German fighters because of the lack of dive flaps to counter compressibility in dives. German fighter pilots not wishing to fight would perform the first half of a [[Split S]] and continue into steep dives because they knew the Lightnings would be reluctant to follow.\n\nOn the positive side, having two engines was a built-in insurance policy. Many pilots made it safely back to base after having an engine failure en route or in combat. On 3 March 1944, the first Allied fighters reached Berlin on a frustrated escort mission. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Jenkins of [[55th Fighter Group]] led the group of P-38H pilots, arriving with only half his force after flak damage and engine trouble took their toll. On the way into Berlin, Jenkins reported one rough-running engine, causing him to wonder if he would ever make it back. The B-17s he was supposed to escort never showed up, having turned back at Hamburg.

The last P-38s in service with the United States Air Force were retired in 1949.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090905211847/http://www.bvhcenter.org/P-38-Lightning.html \"P-38 Lightning.\"] ''Bvhcenter.org,'' 9 June 2011.</ref> A total of 100 late-model P-38L and F-5 Lightnings were acquired by Italy through an agreement dated April 1946. Delivered, after refurbishing, at the rate of one per month, they finally were all sent to the [[Aeronautica Militare Italiana|Aeronautica Militare]] by 1952. The Lightnings served in the 4\u00b0 ''Stormo'' and other units including 3\u00b0 ''Stormo'', flying reconnaissance over the Balkans, ground attack, naval cooperation and air superiority missions. Due to old engines, pilot errors and lack of experience in operations, a large number of P-38s were lost in at least 30 accidents, many of them fatal. Despite this, many Italian pilots liked the P-38 because of its excellent visibility on the ground and stability on takeoff. The Italian P-38s were phased out in 1956; none survived the scrapyard.<ref>Sgarlato 2000</ref>\n\nSurplus P-38s were also used by other foreign air forces with 12 sold to [[Honduras]] and 15 retained by China. Six F-5s and two unarmed black two-seater P-38s were operated by the Dominican Air Force based in San Isidro Airbase, Dominican Republic in 1947. The majority of wartime Lightnings present in the continental U.S. at the end of the war were put up for sale for US$1,200 apiece; the rest were scrapped. P-38s in distant theaters of war were bulldozed into piles and abandoned or scrapped; very few avoided that fate.\n\nThe CIA \"Liberation Air Force\" flew one P-38M to support the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat]].

Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was among those who bought a Lightning, choosing a P-38J model and painting it red to make it stand out as an [[Air racing|air racer]] and [[Competition aerobatics|stunt flyer]]. Lefty Gardner, former B-24 and B-17 pilot and associate of the [[Confederate Air Force]], bought a mid-1944 P-38L-1-LO that had been modified into an F-5G. Gardner painted it white with red and blue trim and named it ''White Lightnin{{'}}''; he reworked its turbo systems and intercoolers for optimum low-altitude performance and gave it P-38F style air intakes for better streamlining. ''White Lightnin{{'}}'' was severely damaged in a crash landing following an engine fire on a transit flight and was bought and restored with a brilliant polished aluminum finish by the company that owns [[Red Bull]]. The aircraft is now located in Austria.\n\nF-5s were bought by [[aerial survey]] companies and employed for mapping. From the 1950s on, the use of the Lightning steadily declined, and only a little more than two dozen still exist, with few still flying. One example is a P-38L owned by the [[Lone Star Flight Museum]] in [[Galveston, Texas]], painted in the colors of [[Charles H. MacDonald]]'s ''Putt Putt Maru''. Two other examples are F-5Gs which were owned and operated by Kargl Aerial Surveys in 1946, and are now located in [[Chino, California]] at Yanks Air Museum, and in [[McMinnville, Oregon]] at [[Evergreen Aviation Museum]]. The earliest-built surviving P-38, ''[[Glacier Girl]]'', was recovered from the Greenland ice cap in 1992, fifty years after she crashed there on a ferry flight to the UK, and after a complete restoration, flew once again ten years after her recovery.\n\n==Production==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"  width=400px style=\"float:right; text-align:left; background:#faf5ff; font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Version and total manufactured or converted<ref name=\"Production\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/MuseumExhibits/FactSheets/Display/tabid/509/Article/196280/lockheed-p-38l-lightning.aspx Lockheed P-38L Lightning].

The Lightning had a major effect on other aircraft; its wing, in a scaled-up form, was used on the Lockheed Constellation.<ref name=\"johnson_bio\">[[Clarence Johnson|Johnson, Clarence L. \"Kelly\"]]. ''Kelly: More Than My Share of it All.'' Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books, 1985. {{ISBN|0-87474-491-1}}.</ref>\n\n===P-38D and P-38Es===\nDelivered and accepted Lightning production variants began with the '''P-38D''' model. The few \"hand made\" YP-38s initially contracted were used as trainers and test aircraft. There were no '''B'''s or '''C'''s delivered to the government as the USAAF allocated the 'D' suffix to all aircraft with self-sealing fuel tanks and armor.<ref name=\"FTDevil\">Caidin, Martin. ''Fork-tailed Devil'', New York: Ballantine Books, 1983. {{ISBN|0-345-31292-9}}.</ref> Many secondary but still initial teething tests were conducted using the earliest D variants.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/>\n\nThe first combat-capable Lightning was the '''P-38E''' (and its photo-recon variant the  '''F-4''') which featured improved instruments, electrical, and hydraulic systems. Part-way through production, the older [[Hamilton Standard]] Hydromatic hollow steel propellers were replaced by new [[Curtiss-Wright#Curtiss Electric propellers|Curtiss Electric duraluminum propellers]]. The definitive (and now famous) armament configuration was settled upon, featuring four .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns with 500 rpg, and a 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404#US production|Hispano]] autocannon with 150 rounds.<ref>Spick 2002, p. 224.</ref>\n\nWhile the machine guns had been arranged symmetrically in the nose on the P-38D, they were \"staggered\" in the P-38E and later versions, with the muzzles protruding from the nose in the relative lengths of roughly 1:4:6:2. This was done to ensure a straight ammunition-belt feed into the weapons, as the earlier arrangement led to jamming.\n\nThe first P-38E rolled out of the factory in October 1941 as the [[Battle of Moscow]] filled the news wires of the world. Because of the versatility, redundant engines, and especially high speed and high altitude characteristics of the aircraft, as with later variants over a hundred P-38Es were completed in the factory or converted in the field to a photoreconnaissance variant, the '''F-4''', in which the guns were replaced by four cameras. Most of these early reconnaissance Lightnings were retained stateside for training, but the F-4 was the first Lightning to be used in action in April 1942.\n\n[[File:Repairs to P-38 by 459th Fighter Squadron at Chittagong, India - January 1945.jpg|left|thumb|Ground crew members of the 459th Fighter Squadron, nicknamed the \"Twin Dragon Squadron\", working on a Lockheed P-38 at an air base in [[Chittagong]], India \u2013 January 1945]]\n\n===P-38Fs and P-38Gs===\nAfter 210 P-38Es were built, they were followed, starting in February 1942, by the '''P-38F''', which incorporated racks inboard of the engines for fuel tanks or a total of {{convert|2000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[bomb]]s. Early variants did not enjoy a high reputation for maneuverability, though they could be agile at low altitudes if flown by a capable pilot, using the P-38's forgiving stall characteristics to their best advantage. From the P-38F-15 model onwards, a \"combat maneuver\" setting was added to the P-38's [[flap (aircraft)|Fowler flaps]]. When deployed at the 8\u00b0 maneuver setting, the flaps allowed the P-38 to out-turn many contemporary single-engined fighters at the cost of some added drag. However, early variants were hampered by high aileron control forces and a low initial rate of roll,<ref name=Eglin1942>[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/p-38/p-38f-tactical-trials.html \"WWII Aircraft Performance: P-38F Tactical Trials\".] ''Final Report on Tactical Suitability of the P-38F Type Airplane'', 6 March 1943. Retrieved: 19 January 2009.</ref> and all such features required a pilot to gain experience with the aircraft,<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> which in part was an additional reason Lockheed sent its representative to England, and later to the Pacific Theater.\n\nThe aircraft was still experiencing extensive teething troubles as well as being victimized by \"urban legends\", mostly involving inapplicable twin engine factors which had been designed out of the aircraft by Lockheed.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> In addition to these, the early versions had a reputation as a \"widow maker\" as it could enter an unrecoverable dive due to a sonic surface effect at high sub-sonic speeds. The 527 P-38Fs were heavier, with more powerful engines that used more fuel, and were unpopular in the air war in Northern Europe.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> Since the heavier engines were having reliability problems and with them, without external fuel tanks, the range of the P-38F was reduced, and since drop tanks themselves were in short supply as the fortunes in the Battle of the Atlantic had not yet swung the Allies' way, the aircraft became relatively unpopular in minds of the bomber command planning staffs despite being the longest ranged fighter first available to the 8th Air Force in sufficient numbers for long range escort duties.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> Nonetheless, [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|General Spaatz]], then commander of the 8th Air Force in the UK, said of the P-38F: \"I'd rather have an airplane that goes like hell and has a few things wrong with it, than one that won't go like hell and has a few things wrong with it.\"<ref name=Lockheed1958/>\n\n[[File:Lockheed P-38G-1-LO Lightning LOC fsa.8d22581.jpg|thumb|left|Lockheed P-38G-1-LO Lightning, serial 42-12723]]\nThe P-38F was followed in June 1942 by the '''P-38G''', using more powerful Allisons of {{convert|1400|hp|kW|abbr=on}} each and equipped with a better radio. A dozen of the planned P-38G production were set aside to serve as prototypes for what would become the P-38J with further uprated Allison V-1710F-17 engines ({{convert|1425|hp|kW|abbr=on}} each) in redesigned booms which featured chin-mounted intercoolers in place of the original system in the leading edge of the wings and more efficient radiators. Lockheed subcontractors, however, were initially unable to supply both of Burbank's twin production lines with a sufficient quantity of new core intercoolers and radiators. War Production Board planners were unwilling to sacrifice production, and one of the two remaining prototypes received the new engines but retained the old leading edge intercoolers and radiators.\n\n[[File:Lockheed P-38H-5-LO 061019-F-1234P-005.jpg|right|thumb|A P-38H]]\n\nAs the '''P-38H''', 600 of these stop-gap Lightnings with an improved 20&nbsp;mm cannon and a bomb capacity of {{convert|3200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} were produced on one line beginning in May 1943 while the near-definitive P-38J began production on the second line in August 1943. The Eighth Air Force was experiencing high altitude and cold weather issues which, while not unique to the aircraft, were perhaps more severe as the [[turbo-supercharger]]s upgrading the Allisons were having their own reliability issues making the aircraft more unpopular with senior officers out of the line.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> This was a situation unduplicated on all other fronts where the commands were clamoring for as many P-38s as they could get.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> Both the P-38G and P-38H models' performance was restricted by an intercooler system integral to the wing's leading edge which had been designed for the YP-38's less powerful engines. At the higher boost levels, the new engine's charge air temperature would increase above the limits recommended by Allison and would be subject to detonation if operated at high power for extended periods of time. Reliability was not the only issue, either. For example, the reduced power settings required by the P-38H did not allow the maneuvering flap to be used to good advantage at high altitude.<ref>Bodie 1991, p. 166.</ref> All these problems really came to a head in the unplanned P-38H and sped the Lightning's eventual replacement in the Eighth Air Force; fortunately the Fifteenth Air Force were glad to get them.\n\nSome P-38G production was diverted on the assembly line to '''F-5A''' [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]]. An F-5A was modified to an experimental two-seat reconnaissance configuration as the '''XF-5D''', with a plexiglas nose, two machine guns and additional cameras in the tail booms.\n\n===P-38J, P-38L===\n[[File:4 Lockheed P-38 Lightnings in formation.jpg|left|thumb|Four P-38Hs flying in formation]]\n\nThe '''P-38J''' was introduced in August 1943. The turbo-supercharger [[intercooler]] system on previous variants had been housed in the leading edges of the wings and had proven vulnerable to combat damage and could burst if the wrong series of controls were mistakenly activated. In the P-38J series, the streamlined engine nacelles of previous Lightnings were changed to fit the intercooler radiator between the oil coolers, forming a \"chin\" that visually distinguished the J model from its predecessors. While the P-38J used the same V-1710-89/91 engines as the H model, the new core-type intercooler more efficiently lowered intake manifold temperatures and permitted a substantial increase in rated power. The leading edge of the outer wing was fitted with {{convert|55|gal|l|abbr=on}} fuel tanks, filling the space formerly occupied by intercooler tunnels, but these were omitted on early P-38J blocks due to limited availability.<ref>Bodie 1991, p. 172.</ref>\n\nThe final 210 J models, designated P-38J-25-LO, alleviated the compressibility problem through the addition of a set of electrically actuated dive recovery flaps just outboard of the engines on the bottom centerline of the wings. With these improvements, a USAAF pilot reported a dive speed of almost {{convert|600|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, although the indicated air speed was later corrected for compressibility error, and the actual dive speed was lower.<ref name=\"Baugher P-38J\">Baugher, Joe. [http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/p38_13.html \"Lockheed P-38J Lightning.\"] ''Joe Baugher's Encyclopedia of American Military Aircraft'', 5 June 1999. Retrieved: 29 January 2007.</ref> Lockheed manufactured over 200 retrofit modification kits to be installed on P-38J-10-LO and J-20-LO already in Europe, but the USAAF C-54 carrying them was shot down by an RAF pilot who mistook the Douglas transport for a German Focke-Wulf Condor.<ref>Bodie 1991, p. 208.</ref> Unfortunately, the loss of the kits came during Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier's four-month morale-boosting tour of P-38 bases. Flying a new Lightning named \"Snafuperman\", modified to full P-38J-25-LO specifications at Lockheed's modification center near Belfast, LeVier captured the pilots' full attention by routinely performing maneuvers during March 1944 that common Eighth Air Force wisdom held to be suicidal. It proved too little, too late, because the decision had already been made to re-equip with Mustangs.<ref>Bodie 1991, p. 210.</ref>\n\nThe P-38J-25-LO production block also introduced hydraulically boosted ailerons, one of the first times such a system was fitted to a fighter. This significantly improved the Lightning's rate of roll and reduced control forces for the pilot. This production block and the following P-38L model are considered the definitive Lightnings, and Lockheed ramped up production, working with subcontractors across the country to produce hundreds of Lightnings each month.\n\nThere were two '''P-38K'''s developed from 1942 to 1943, one official and one an internal Lockheed experiment. The first was actually a battered RP-38E \"piggyback\" test mule previously used by Lockheed to test the P-38J chin intercooler installation, now fitted with paddle-bladed \"high activity\" Hamilton Standard Hydromatic propellers similar to those used on the P-47. The new propellers required [[Spinner (aeronautics)|spinners]] of greater diameter, and the mule's crude, hand-formed sheet steel cowlings were further stretched to blend the spinners into the nacelles. It retained its \"piggyback\" configuration that allowed an observer to ride behind the pilot. With Lockheed's AAF representative as a passenger and the maneuvering flap deployed to offset Army Hot Day conditions, the old \"K-Mule\" still climbed to {{convert|45000|ft|m}}. With a fresh coat of paint covering its crude hand-formed steel cowlings, this RP-38E acts as stand-in for the \"P-38K-1-LO\"  in the model's only picture.<ref name=\"Bodie 2001, pp. 169\u2013171\">Bodie 2001, pp. 169\u2013171.</ref>\n\nThe 12th G model originally set aside as a P-38J prototype was re-designated P-38K-1-LO and fitted with the aforementioned paddle-blade propellers and new Allison V-1710-75/77 (F15R/L) powerplants rated at {{convert|1875|bhp|abbr=on}} at War Emergency Power. These engines were geared 2.36 to 1, unlike the standard P-38 ratio of 2 to 1. The AAF took delivery in September 1943, at [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin Field]]. In tests, the P-38K-1 achieved {{convert|432|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at military power and was predicted to exceed {{convert|450|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at War Emergency Power with a similar increase in load and range. The initial climb rate was {{convert|4800|ft|m|abbr=on}}/min and the ceiling was {{convert|46000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. It reached {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}} in five minutes flat; this with a coat of camouflage paint which added weight and drag. Although it was judged superior in climb and speed to the latest and best fighters from all AAF manufacturers, the War Production Board refused to authorize P-38K production due to the two-to-three-week interruption in production necessary to implement cowling modifications for the revised [[Spinner (aeronautics)|spinners]] and higher thrust line.<ref name=\"Bodie 2001, pp. 169\u2013171\"/> Some have also doubted Allison's ability to deliver the F15 engine in quantity.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071021024320/http://www.p-38online.com/p38k.html \"P38K.\"] ''P-38 Lightning online,'' 21 October 2007.

It entered service with the [[USAAF]] in June 1944, in time to support the Allied invasion of France on [[D-Day]]. Lockheed production of the Lightning was distinguished by a suffix consisting of a production block number followed by \"LO,\" for example \"P-38L-1-LO\", while Consolidated-Vultee production was distinguished by a block number followed by \"VN,\" for example \"P-38L-5-VN.\"\n\nThe P-38L was the first Lightning fitted with zero-length rocket launchers.

A few P-38Ls were field-modified to become two-seat '''TP-38L''' familiarization trainers. During and after June 1948, the remaining J and L variants were designated ZF-38J and ZF-38L, with the \"ZF\" designator (meaning \"obsolete fighter\") replacing the \"P for Pursuit\" category.\n\nLate model Lightnings were delivered unpainted, as per USAAF policy established in 1944. At first, field units tried to paint them, since pilots worried about being too visible to the enemy, but it turned out the reduction in weight and drag was a minor advantage in combat.\n\nThe P-38L-5, the most common sub-variant of the P-38L, had a modified cockpit heating system consisting of a plug-socket in the cockpit into which the pilot could plug his heat-suit wire for improved comfort.

The floats would be removed before the aircraft went into combat. There were concerns that saltwater spray would corrode the tailplane, and so in March 1942, P-38E ''41-1986'' was modified with a tailplane raised some {{convert|16|\u2013|18|in|cm|abbr=on}}, booms lengthened by two feet and a rearward-facing second seat added for an observer to monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangement. A second version was crafted on the same airframe with the twin booms given greater sideplane area to augment the vertical rudders. This arrangement was removed and a final third version was fabricated that had the booms returned to normal length but the tail raised {{convert|33|in|cm|abbr=on}}. All three tail modifications were designed by George H. \"Bert\" Estabrook. The final version was used for a quick series of dive tests on 7 December 1942 in which Milo Burcham performed the test maneuvers and Kelly Johnson observed from the rear seat. Johnson concluded that the raised floatplane tail gave no advantage in solving the problem of compressibility. At no time was this P-38E testbed airframe actually fitted with floats, and the idea was quickly abandoned as the U.S. Navy proved to have enough [[sealift]] capacity to keep up with P-38 deliveries to the South Pacific.<ref name=\"Bodie p. 32\">Bodie 2001, pp. 118\u2013121.</ref>\n\nStill another P-38E was used in 1942 to tow a [[CG-4 Hadrian|Waco troop glider]] as a demonstration. However, there proved to be plenty of other aircraft, such as [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s, available to tow gliders, and the Lightning was spared this duty.\n\nStandard Lightnings were used as crew and cargo transports in the South Pacific. They were fitted with pods attached to the underwing pylons, replacing drop tanks or bombs, that could carry a single passenger in a lying-down position, or cargo. This was a very uncomfortable way to fly. Some of the pods were not even fitted with a window to let the passenger see out or bring in light.\n\nLockheed proposed a carrier-based '''Model 822''' version of the Lightning for the [[United States Navy]]. The Model 822 would have featured folding wings, an arresting hook, and stronger undercarriage for carrier operations. The navy was not interested, as they regarded the Lightning as too big for carrier operations and did not like liquid-cooled engines anyway, and the Model 822 never went beyond the paper stage. However, the navy did operate four land-based F-5Bs in North Africa, inherited from the USAAF and redesignated '''FO-1'''.\n\nA P-38J was used in experiments with an unusual scheme for [[Aerial refueling|mid-air refueling]], in which the fighter snagged a drop tank trailed on a cable from a bomber. The USAAF managed to make this work, but decided it was not practical. A P-38J was also fitted with experimental retractable snow ski landing gear, but this idea never reached operational service either.\n\nAfter the war, a P-38L was experimentally fitted with armament of three .60&nbsp;in (15.2&nbsp;mm) machine guns. The .60&nbsp;in (15.2&nbsp;mm) caliber cartridge had been developed early in the war for an infantry [[anti-tank rifle]], a type of weapon developed by a number of nations in the 1930s when tanks were lighter but, by 1942, armor was too tough for this caliber.\n\nAnother P-38L was modified after the war as a \"super strafer,\" with eight .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns in the nose and a pod under each wing with two .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns, for a total of 12 machine guns. Nothing came of this conversion either.\n\n==Variants==\n;XP-38\n:United States Army Air Force designation for one prototype Lockheed Model 22 first flown in 1939.<ref name=\"andrade146\">Andrade 1979, pp. 146\u2013147</ref>\n;YP-38\n:Redesigned pre-production batch with armament, 13 built.<ref name=\"andrade146\" />\n;P-38\n:First production variant with 0.5 in guns and a 37 mm cannon, 30 built.<ref name=\"andrade146\" /><ref name=\"kinzey33\">Kinzey 1998, pp. 33</ref>\n;XP-38A\n:Thirtieth P-38 modified with a pressurised cockpit.<ref name=\"andrade146\" /><ref name=\"kinzey33\" />\n;Lightning I\n:Former Arm\u00e9e de l'air order for 667 aircraft (being reduced to 143 Lighting I's) which was taken by the Royal Air Force.

What followed was a harrowing and life-threatening landing of the entire squadron on a remote ice cap in Greenland. None of the crew was lost and they were all rescued and returned safely home after spending several days on the ice.\n\nFifty years later a small group of aviation enthusiasts decided to locate those aircraft, which had come to be known as \"The Lost Squadron\", and to recover one of the lost P-38s. It turned out to be no easy task, as the planes had been buried under 25 stories of ice and drifted over a mile from their original location. The recovered P-38, dubbed \"Glacier Girl\", was eventually restored to airworthiness.\n\n==='Maid of Harlech'===\nThis plane crashed in September 1942, and is buried in the sea off the coast of Harlech, Wales, United Kingdom.

Majors [[Richard Bong|Richard I. \"Dick\" Bong]] and [[Thomas McGuire|Thomas B. \"Tommy\" McGuire]] of the USAAF competed for the top position. Both men were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].\n\nMcGuire was killed in air combat in January 1945 over the [[Philippines]], after accumulating 38 confirmed kills, making him the second-ranking American ace. Bong was rotated back to the United States as America's ace of aces, after making 40 kills, becoming a test pilot. He was killed on 6 August 1945, the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan, when his [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]] jet fighter flamed out on [[takeoff]].\n\n[[File:Thomas B.

He worked to improve range and load limits of the [[Vought F4U Corsair]], flying both routine and combat strafing missions in Corsairs alongside [[United States Marine Corps Aviation|Marine]] pilots.\n\nEverywhere Lindbergh went in the South Pacific, he was accorded the normal preferential treatment of a visiting colonel, although he had resigned his Air Corps Reserve colonel's commission three years before. In Hollandia, Lindbergh attached himself to the 475th FG, flying P-38s. Although new to the aircraft, Lindbergh was instrumental in extending the range of the P-38 through improved throttle settings, or engine-leaning techniques, notably by reducing engine speed to 1,600&nbsp;rpm, setting the carburetors for auto-lean and flying at {{convert|185|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[indicated airspeed]] which reduced fuel consumption to 70&nbsp;gal/h, about 2.6&nbsp;mpg. This combination of settings had been considered dangerous and would upset the fuel mixture, causing an explosion.<ref>Kirkland 2003, pp. 29\u201335.</ref>\n\nWhile with the 475th, he held training classes and took part in a number of Army Air Corps combat missions. On 28 July 1944, Lindbergh shot down a [[Mitsubishi Ki-51]] \"Sonia\" flown by the veteran commander of 73rd Independent Flying [[Chutaicho|Chutai]], [[Imperial Japanese Army]] Captain Saburo Shimada. In an extended, twisting dogfight in which many of the participants ran out of ammunition, Shimada turned his aircraft directly toward Lindbergh who was just approaching the combat area. Lindbergh fired in a defensive reaction brought on by Shimada's apparent head-on [[Aerial ramming|ramming attack]]. Hit by cannon and machine gun fire, the \"Sonia's\" propeller visibly slowed, but Shimada held his course. Lindbergh pulled up at the last moment to avoid collision as the damaged \"Sonia\" went into a steep dive, hit the ocean and sank. Lindbergh's wingman, ace Joseph E. \"Fishkiller\" Miller, Jr., had also scored hits on the \"Sonia\" after it had begun its fatal dive, but Miller was certain the kill credit was Lindbergh's. The unofficial kill was not entered in the 475th's war record. On 12 August 1944, Lindbergh left Hollandia to return to the United States.<ref>[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/wwii/ \"Charles Lindbergh and the 475th Fighter Group.\"]  ''Lightning Strikes''.

The Lockheed team chose twin booms to accommodate the tail assembly, engines, and turbo-superchargers, with a central nacelle for the pilot and armament. The XP-38 gondola mockup was designed to mount two .50-caliber (12.7&nbsp;mm) [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s with 200&nbsp;rounds per gun (rpg), two .30-caliber (7.62&nbsp;mm) Brownings with 500&nbsp;rpg, and a T1 Army Ordnance 23&nbsp;mm (.90 in) [[autocannon]] with a rotary magazine as a substitute for the non-existent 25&nbsp;mm [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Hotchkiss]] aircraft autocannon specified by Kelsey and Saville.<ref>Bodie 2001, p. 19.</ref> In the YP-38s, a [[M4 cannon|37 mm (1.46 in) M9 autocannon]] with 15 rounds replaced the T1.<ref>Bodie 2001, p. 44.</ref> The 15 rounds were in three five-round clips, an unsatisfactory arrangement according to Kelsey, and the M9 did not perform reliably in flight. Further armament experiments from March to June 1941 resulted in the P-38E combat configuration of four M2 Browning machine guns, and one [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano]] 20&nbsp;mm (.79 in) autocannon with 150 rounds.<ref>Bodie 2001, p. 80.</ref>\n\nClustering all the armament in the nose was unusual in U.S. aircraft, which typically used wing-mounted guns with trajectories set up to crisscross at one or more points in a [[Gun harmonisation|convergence zone]]. Nose-mounted guns did not suffer from having their useful ranges limited by pattern convergence, meaning that good pilots could shoot much farther.

Note the yoke, rather than the more-usual stick.]]\n\nTest flights revealed problems initially believed to be tail [[Wing flutter|flutter]]. During high-speed flight approaching Mach&nbsp;0.68, especially during dives, the aircraft's tail would begin to shake violently and the nose would tuck under (see [[Mach tuck]]), steepening the dive. Once caught in this dive, the fighter would enter a high-speed [[Mach tuck|compressibility stall]] and the controls would lock up, leaving the pilot no option but to bail out (if possible) or remain with the aircraft until it got down to denser air, where he might have a chance to pull out. During a test flight in May 1941, USAAC Major Signa Gilkey managed to stay with a YP-38 in a compressibility lockup, riding it out until he recovered gradually using [[Trim tab|elevator trim]].<ref name=\"Aviation Museum\"/> Lockheed engineers were very concerned at this limitation but first had to concentrate on filling the current order of aircraft. [[1941 in aviation#June|In late June 1941]], the Army Air Corps was renamed the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), and a total of 65 Lightnings were finished for the service by September 1941 with more on the way for the USAAF, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), and the Free French Air Force operating from England.\n\nBy November 1941, many of the initial assembly-line challenges had been met, which freed up time for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had a few ideas for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded servo tabs on the elevator trailing edge designed to aid the pilot when control yoke forces rose over {{convert|30|lb-f|N}}, as would be expected in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot's actions. The expert test pilot, 43-year-old<ref>[http://eugenedownes.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/greatpilot.jpg \"Ralph Virden obituary.\"] ''eugenedownes.tripod.com.'' Retrieved: 10 October 2010.</ref> Ralph Virden, was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes, since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about {{convert|3500|ft|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that servo tabs were ''not'' the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the Army Air Forces personnel were sure it was flutter and ordered Lockheed to look more closely at the tail.\n\nIn 1941 flutter was a familiar engineering problem related to a too-flexible tail, but the P-38's [[empennage]] was completely skinned in aluminum{{refn|\"Sheet Metal Repair to the P-38 Lightning\", original Lockheed training film, from TM Technologies showes skinning and repair.|group=Note}} rather than fabric and was quite rigid. At no time did the P-38 suffer from true flutter.<ref name=\"Bodie p. 58\">Bodie 2001, p. 58.</ref> To prove a point, one elevator and its vertical stabilizers were skinned with metal 63% thicker than standard, but the increase in rigidity made no difference in vibration. Army [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Kenneth B. Wolfe (head of Army Production Engineering) asked Lockheed to try external mass balances above and below the elevator, though the P-38 already had large mass balances elegantly placed within each vertical stabilizer. Various configurations of external mass balances were equipped, and dangerously steep test flights were flown to document their performance. Explaining to Wolfe in Report No. 2414, Kelly Johnson wrote \"the violence of the vibration was unchanged and the diving tendency was naturally the same for all conditions.\"<ref>Bodie 2001, p. 57.</ref> The external mass balances did not help at all. Nonetheless, at Wolfe's insistence, the additional external balances were a feature of every P-38 built from then on.<ref name=\"Baugher YP-38\">Baugher, Joe.

They already had experience of models thrashing around violently at speeds approaching those requested and did not want to risk damaging their tunnel. Gen. Arnold, head of Army Air Forces, ordered them to run the tests, which were done up to Mach 0.74.<ref>Erikson, Albert L. \"Wind-Tunnel Investigation of Devices for Improving The Diving Characteristics of Airplanes.\" ''NACA MR No. 3F12, Summary''.</ref> The P-38's dive problem was revealed to be the [[center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] moving back toward the tail when in high-speed airflow. The solution was to change the geometry of the wing's lower surface when diving in order to keep lift within bounds of the top of the wing. In February 1943, quick-acting dive flaps were tried and proven by Lockheed test pilots. The dive flaps were installed outboard of the engine nacelles, and in action they extended downward 35\u00b0 in 1.5 seconds. The flaps did not act as a speed brake; they affected the pressure distribution in a way that retained the wing's lift.<ref>Bodie 2001, pp. 174\u2013175.</ref>\n\nLate in 1943, a few hundred dive flap field modification kits were assembled to give North African, European and Pacific P-38s a chance to withstand compressibility and expand their combat tactics. Unfortunately, these crucial flaps did not always reach their destination. In March 1944, 200 dive flap kits intended for [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO) P-38Js were destroyed in a mistaken [[identification friend or foe|identification]] incident in which an RAF fighter shot down the [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]] (mistaken for an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200|Fw 200]]) taking the shipment to England. Back in Burbank, P-38Js coming off the assembly line in spring 1944 were towed out to the ramp and modified in the open air. The flaps were finally incorporated into the production line in June 1944 on the last 210 P-38Js. Despite testing having proved the dive flaps effective in improving tactical maneuvers, a 14-month delay in production limited their implementation, with only the final half of all Lightnings built having the dive flaps installed as an assembly-line sequence.<ref>Ethell et al. 1984, p. 14.</ref>\n\nJohnson later recalled:\n{{quote|I broke an ulcer over compressibility on the P-38 because we flew into a speed range where no one had ever been before, and we had difficulty convincing people that it wasn't the funny-looking airplane itself, but a fundamental physical problem. We found out what happened when the Lightning shed its tail and we worked during the whole war to get 15 more kn [28&nbsp;km/h] of speed out of the P-38. We saw compressibility as a brick wall for a long time. Then we learned how to get through it.<ref>Goebel, Greg. [https://web.archive.org/web/20020223121418/http://www.vectorsite.net/avp38.html \"The Lockheed P-38 Lightning.\"] ''vectorsite.net'', Version 1.3. Retrieved: 21 January 2007.</ref>}}\n\n[[Buffeting]] was another early aerodynamic problem. It was difficult to distinguish from compressibility as both were reported by test pilots as \"tail shake\". Buffeting came about from airflow disturbances ahead of the tail; the airplane would shake at high speed. Leading edge wing slots were tried as were combinations of [[fillet (mechanics)|filleting]] between the wing, cockpit and engine nacelles. Air tunnel test number 15 solved the buffeting completely and its fillet solution was fitted to every subsequent P-38 airframe. Fillet kits were sent out to every squadron flying Lightnings. The problem was traced to a 40% increase in air speed at the wing-fuselage junction where the thickness/chord ratio was highest. An airspeed of {{convert|500|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}} could push airflow at the wing-fuselage junction close to the speed of sound. Filleting solved the buffeting problem for the P-38E and later models.<ref name=\"Bodie p. 58\"/>\n\nAnother issue with the P-38 arose from its unique design feature of outwardly rotating (at the \"tops\" of the propeller arcs) counter-rotating propellers. Losing one of two engines in any twin-engine non-[[centerline thrust]] aircraft on takeoff creates sudden drag, yawing the nose toward the dead engine and rolling the wingtip down on the side of the dead engine. Normal training in flying twin-engine aircraft when losing an engine on takeoff is to push the remaining engine to full throttle to maintain airspeed; if a pilot did that in the P-38, regardless of which engine had failed, the resulting engine torque and [[p-factor]] force produced a sudden uncontrollable yawing roll, and the aircraft would flip over and hit the ground. Eventually, procedures were taught to allow a pilot to deal with the situation by reducing power on the running engine, feathering the prop on the failed engine, and then increasing power gradually until the aircraft was in stable flight. Single-engine takeoffs were possible, though not with a full fuel and ammunition load.<ref>Bodie 2001, p. 210.</ref>\n\nThe engines were unusually quiet because the [[Exhaust system|exhausts]] were [[muffler|muffled]] by the [[General Electric]] turbo-superchargers on the twin [[Allison V-1710 engine|Allison V12s]].<ref>Kaplan and Saunders 1991, p. 56.</ref> There were early problems with cockpit temperature regulation; pilots were often too hot in the tropical sun as the canopy could not be fully opened without severe buffeting and were often too cold in northern Europe and at high altitude, as the distance of the engines from the cockpit prevented easy heat transfer. Later variants received modifications (such as electrically heated flight suits) to solve these problems.\n\n[[File:P-38 Lightning at sunset.jpg|left|thumb|P-38 rear view]]\n\nOn 20 September 1939, before the YP-38s had been built and flight tested, the USAAF ordered 66 initial production P-38 Lightnings, 30 of which were delivered to the USAAF in mid-1941, but not all these aircraft were armed. The unarmed aircraft were subsequently fitted with four .50 in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns (instead of the two .50 in/12.7&nbsp;mm and two .30 in/7.62&nbsp;mm of their predecessors) and a 37&nbsp;mm (1.46&nbsp;in) cannon.

Aircraft manufacturers understood that they would not be rewarded if they installed subsystems on their fighters to enable them to carry [[drop tank]]s to provide more fuel for extended range. Lieutenant Kelsey, acting against this policy, risked his career in late 1941 when he convinced Lockheed to incorporate such subsystems in the P-38E model, without putting his request in writing. It is possible that Kelsey was responding to Colonel [[George William Goddard]]'s observation that the US sorely needed a high-speed, long-range [[photo reconnaissance]] plane. Along with a [[change order]] specifying some P-38Es be produced without guns but with photo reconnaissance cameras, to be designated the F-4-1-LO, Lockheed began working out the problems of drop tank design and incorporation. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, eventually about 100 P-38Es were sent to a modification center near [[Dallas, Texas]], or to the new Lockheed assembly plant B-6 (today the [[Burbank Airport]]), to be fitted with four K-17 [[aerial photography]] cameras. All of these aircraft were also modified to be able to carry drop tanks. P-38Fs were modified as well. Every Lightning from the P-38G onward was capable of being fitted with drop tanks straight off the assembly line.<ref name=Bodie89>Bodie 2001, pp. 89\u201391.</ref>\n\nIn March 1942, General Arnold made an off-hand comment that the US could avoid the [[Battle of the Atlantic|German U-boat menace]] by flying fighters to the UK (rather than packing them onto ships). [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] pressed the point, emphasizing his interest in the solution. Arnold was likely aware of the flying radius extension work being done on the P-38, which by this time had seen success with small drop tanks in the range of {{convert|150|to|165|gal|L|abbr=on}}, the difference in capacity being the result of subcontractor production variation. Arnold ordered further tests with larger drop tanks in the range of {{convert|300|to|310|gal|L|abbr=on}}; the results were reported by Kelsey as providing the P-38 with a {{convert|2500|mi|km|adj=on}} ferrying range.<ref name=Bodie89/> Because of available supply, the smaller drop tanks were used to fly Lightnings to the UK, the plan called [[Operation Bolero]].\n\nLed by two [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]es, the first seven P-38s, each carrying two small drop tanks, left [[Presque Isle International Airport|Presque Isle Army Air Field]] on 23 June 1942 for [[RAF Heathfield]] in Scotland. Their first refueling stop was made in far northeast Canada at [[CFB Goose Bay|Goose Bay]]. The second stop was a rough airstrip in Greenland called [[Narsarsuaq Air Base|Bluie West One]], and the third refueling stop was in [[Iceland]] at [[Naval Air Station Keflavik|Keflavik]]. Other P-38s followed this route with some lost in mishaps, usually due to poor weather, low visibility, radio difficulties and navigational errors. Nearly 200 of the P-38Fs (and a few modified Es) were successfully flown across the Atlantic in July\u2013August 1942, making the P-38 the first USAAF fighter to reach Britain and the first fighter ever to be delivered across the Atlantic under its own power.<ref>McFarland and Newton 1991, p. 103.</ref> Kelsey himself piloted one of the Lightnings, landing in Scotland on 25 July.<ref>Bodie 2001, pp. 101\u2013102.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Lockheed P-38 Lightnings on CVE.jpg|thumb|Cocooned Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and North American Aviation P-51 Mustangs line the decks of a U.S. Navy Escort \"Jeep\" Carrier (CVE) ready for shipment to Europe from New York.]]\n\nThe first unit to receive P-38s was the [[1st Operations Group#1st Fighter Group in World War II|1st Fighter Group]].

More Lightnings were lost due to severe weather and other conditions than enemy action; there were cases where Lightning pilots, mesmerized by flying for hours over gray seas under gray skies, simply flew into the water.

The P-38s were initially based at [[Oran Tafraoui Airport|Tafaroui airfield]] in Algeria alongside [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Warhawks]] and the rest of the 12th Air Force. P-38s were first involved in North African combat operations on 11 November 1942. The first North African P-38 kill was on 22 November when Lieutenant Mark Shipman of the 14th downed an Italian airplane with twin engines. Shipman later made two more kills: a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter and a very large [[Messerschmitt Me 323|Me 323 ''Gigant'']] transport.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 71\">Stanaway 2014, p. 71.</ref>\n\nEarly results in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] were mixed. Some P-38 pilots scored multiple kills to become aces, while many others were shot down due to inexperience or tactical strictures. Overall, the P-38 suffered its highest losses in the Mediterranean Theater. The primary function of the P-38 in North Africa was to escort bombers,<ref name=\"Blake 2012, p. 14\">Blake 2012, p. 14</ref> but the fighters also targeted transport aircraft, and later in the campaign they were sometimes tasked with ground attack missions. When tied to bomber escort duties, the P-38 squadrons were vulnerable to attack from above by German fighters who selected the most advantageous position and timing. The ineffectual early tactical doctrine of the American units required the P-38s to fly near the bombers at all times rather than to defend aggressively or to fly ahead and clear the airspace for the bombers, and many American pilots were downed because of this limitation. Losses mounted, and all available P-38s in the UK were flown to North Africa to restore squadron strength.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 71\"/> After this painful experience, the American leadership changed tactics, and in February 1943 the P-38 was given free rein in its battles.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 72\">Stanaway 2014, p. 72.</ref>\n\nThe first German success against the P-38 was on 28 November when Bf 109 pilots of [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] claimed seven Lightnings for no loss of their own.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 72\"/> Further one-sided German victories were noted on several occasions through January 1943.<ref>Bergstrom 2019, pp. 315\u2013316.</ref> The first P-38 pilots to achieve ace status were Virgil Smith of the 14th FG and [[Jack M. Ilfrey|Jack Illfrey]] of the 1st FG, both credited with five wins by 26 December. Smith got a sixth enemy aircraft on 28 December but was killed two days later in a crash landing, likely after taking fire from ''Oberfeldwebel'' [[Herbert Rollwage]] of JG 53 who survived the war with at least 71 kills.

The first kill by the 82nd was during a bomber escort mission on 7 January 1943 when William J. \"Dixie\" Sloan broke formation and turned toward six attacking Bf 109s to shoot one of them down. Known for his maverick style, Sloan racked up 12 victories by July 1943.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 73\"/> After another heavy toll in January 1943, 14th FG had to be withdrawn from the front to reorganize, with surviving pilots sent home and the few remaining Lightnings transferred to the 82nd.<ref name=\"Blake 2012, p. 14\"/> The 14th was out of action for three months, returning in May.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 74\">Stanaway 2014, p. 74.</ref>\n\nOn 5 April 1943, 26 P-38Fs of the 82nd claimed 31 enemy aircraft destroyed, helping to establish air superiority in the area and earning it the German nickname \"''der Gabelschwanz Teufel''\"&nbsp;\u2013 the Fork-Tailed Devil.<ref name=\"Baugher European\"/> The P-38 remained active in the Mediterranean for the rest of the war, continuing to deliver and receive damage in combat.

German fighter pilot appraisal of the P-38 was mixed. Some observers dismissed the P-38 as an easy kill while others gave it high praise, a deadly enemy worthy of respect. [[Johannes Steinhoff]], commander of JG 77 in North Africa, said that the unit's old Bf 109s were \"perhaps, a little faster\" than the P-38, but a dogfight with the twin-engined fighter was daunting because its turning radius was much smaller, and it could quickly get on the tail of the Bf 109. [[Franz Stigler]], an ace with 28 kills, flew Bf 109s against the P-38 in North Africa. Stigler said the Lightning \"could turn inside us with ease and they could go from level flight to climb almost instantaneously. We lost quite a few pilots who tried to make an attack and then pull up... One cardinal rule we never forgot was: avoid fighting the P-38 head on. That was suicide.\" Stigler said the best defense was to flick-roll the Bf 109 and dive, as the Lightning was slow in the first 10 degrees of roll, and it was not as fast in a dive.<ref name=\"Laurier 2016, p. 54.\">Laurier 2016, p. 54.</ref> [[Herbert Kaiser]], eventually a 68-kill ace, shot down his first P-38 in January 1943. Kaiser said that the P-38 should be respected as a formidable opponent, that it was faster and more maneuverable than the Bf 109G-6 model he flew, especially since the G-6 was slowed by underwing cannon pods. [[Johann Pichler]], another high-scoring ace, said that the P-38 in 1943 was much faster in a climb than the Bf 109.<ref name=\"Stanaway 2014, p. 74\"/> [[Kurt B\u00fchligen]], third-highest scoring German pilot on the Western front with 112 victories, recalled: \"The P-38 fighter (and the B-24) were easy to burn.

''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' chief test pilot ''colonnello'' (Lieutenant Colonel) Angelo Tondi flew the aircraft to [[Guidonia Montecelio|Guidonia]] airfield where the P-38G was evaluated. On 11 August 1943, Tondi took off to intercept a formation of about 50 bombers, returning from the bombing of [[Terni]] ([[Umbria]]). Tondi attacked B-17G \"Bonny Sue\", s.n. 42-30307, that fell off the shore of [[Torvaianica]], near [[Rome]], while six airmen parachuted out. According to US sources, he also damaged three more bombers on that occasion.

On the morning of 10 June 1944, 96 P-38Js of the 1st and 82nd Fighter Groups took off from Italy for [[Ploie\u0219ti]], the third-most heavily defended target in Europe, after [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]].<ref name=Cesarani/> Instead of bombing from high altitude as had been tried by the [[Fifteenth Air Force#Oil Industry Targets|Fifteenth Air Force]], USAAF planning had determined that a dive-bombing surprise attack, beginning at about {{convert|7000|ft|m|-2}} with bomb release at or below {{convert|3000|ft|m|-2}},<ref name=Cesarani>Cesarani and Kavanaugh 2004, pp. 234\u2013235.</ref> performed by 46 [[82d Operations Group|82nd Fighter Group]] P-38s, each carrying one {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|adj=on}} bomb, would yield more accurate results.<ref name=\"Stanaway ETO/MTO\">Stanaway 1998, pp.&nbsp;43\u201346.</ref> All of [[1st Operations Group#Italian operations|1st Fighter Group]] and a few aircraft in 82nd Fighter Group were to fly cover, and all fighters were to strafe targets of opportunity on the return trip; a distance of some {{convert|1255|mi|km|-1}}, including a circuitous outward route made in an attempt to achieve surprise.<ref name=Cesarani/>\n\nSome 85 or 86 fighters arrived in Romania to find enemy airfields alerted, with a wide assortment of aircraft scrambling for safety. P-38s shot down several, including [[heavy fighter]]s, transports and observation aircraft. At Ploie\u0219ti, defense forces were fully alert, the target was concealed by [[smoke screen]], and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] was very heavy, seven Lightnings were lost to anti-aircraft fire at the target, and two more during strafing attacks on the return flight. German Bf&nbsp;109 fighters from I./JG 53 and 2./JG 77 fought the Americans. Sixteen aircraft of the [[71st Fighter Squadron]] were challenged by a large formation of Romanian single-seater [[IAR 80#IAR.81|IAR.81C]] fighters.

Test pilot Captain [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]], [[Fleet Air Arm]], recalled:\n\n<blockquote>We had found out that the Bf&nbsp;109 and the FW&nbsp;190 could fight up to a Mach of 0.75, three-quarters the speed of sound. We checked the Lightning and it couldn't fly in combat faster than 0.68. So it was useless. We told Doolittle that all it was good for was photo-reconnaissance and had to be withdrawn from escort duties. And the funny thing is that the Americans had great difficulty understanding this because the Lightning had the two top aces in the Far East.<ref name=\"Thompson with Smith p. 240.\">Thompson with Smith 2008, p. 240.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter evaluation tests at Farnborough, the P-38 was kept in fighting service in Europe for a while longer. Although many failings were remedied with the introduction of the P-38J, by September 1944, all but one of the Lightning groups in the Eighth Air Force had converted to the P-51 Mustang. The Eighth Air Force continued to conduct reconnaissance missions using the F-5 variant.<ref name=\"Baugher European\"/>\n\n===Pacific theater===\n[[File:\"Give us More P-38's\" - NARA - 514398.jpg|thumb|left|Wartime poster encouraging greater production of P-38s]]\n\nThe P-38 was used most extensively and successfully in the Pacific theater, where it proved more suited, combining exceptional range with the reliability of two engines for long missions over water. The P-38 was used in a variety of roles, especially escorting bombers at altitudes of {{convert|18000|\u2013|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The P-38 was credited with destroying more Japanese aircraft than any other USAAF fighter.<ref name=\"Donald\"/> Freezing cockpit temperatures were not a problem at low altitude in the tropics. In fact the cockpit was often too hot since opening a window while in flight caused buffeting by setting up turbulence through the [[tailplane]]. Pilots taking low altitude assignments often flew stripped down to shorts, tennis shoes, and parachute. While the P-38 could not out-turn the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M Zero]] and most other Japanese fighters when flying below {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}, its superior speed coupled with a good rate of climb meant that it could use [[Basic fighter maneuvers#Energy management|energy tactics]], making multiple high-speed passes at its target. In addition, its tightly grouped guns were even more deadly to lightly armored Japanese warplanes than to German aircraft. The concentrated, parallel stream of bullets allowed aerial victory at much longer distances than fighters carrying wing guns. [[Richard Bong|Dick Bong]], the United States' highest-scoring World War II air ace (40 victories in P-38s), flew directly at his targets to ensure he hit them, in some cases flying through the debris of his target (and on one occasion colliding with an enemy aircraft which was claimed as a \"probable\" victory). The twin Allison engines performed admirably in the Pacific.\n\n[[File:Plane-3.jpg|thumb|Col. MacDonald and Al Nelson in the Pacific with MacDonald's P-38J.]]\n\nGeneral [[George C. Kenney]], commander of the USAAF [[Fifth Air Force|5th Air Force]] operating in [[New Guinea]], could not get enough P-38s; they had become his favorite fighter in November 1942 when one squadron, the [[39th Fighter Squadron]] of the 35th Fighter Group, joined his assorted P-39s and P-40s. The Lightnings established local air superiority with their first combat action on 27 December 1942.<ref>Kenney 1997, pp. 171\u2013173.</ref><ref>Hearn 2008, p. 86.</ref><ref>Schom 2004, p. 310.</ref><ref>Stanaway 1997, pp. 7\u20138.</ref><ref>McFarland 1997, p. 33.</ref> Kenney sent repeated requests to Arnold for more P-38s, and was rewarded with occasional shipments, but Europe was a higher priority in Washington.<ref>Bruning 2003, p. 124.</ref> Despite their small force, Lightning pilots began to compete in racking up scores against Japanese aircraft.\n\nOn 2\u20134 March 1943, P-38s flew top cover for 5th Air Force and Australian bombers and attack aircraft during the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], in which eight Japanese troop transports and four escorting destroyers were sunk. Two P-38 aces from the 39th Fighter Squadron were killed on the second day of the battle: Bob Faurot and Hoyt \"Curley\" Eason (a veteran with five victories who had trained hundreds of pilots, including Dick Bong). In one notable engagement on 3 March 1943 P-38s escorted 13 B-17s as they bombed the Japanese convoy from a medium altitude of 7,000 feet which dispersed the convoy formation and reduced their concentrated anti-aircraft firepower. A B-17 was shot down and when Japanese Zero fighters machine-gunned some of the B-17 crew members that bailed out in parachutes, three P-38s promptly engaged and shot down five of the Zeros.<ref name=\"Gillison, pp. 692-693\">Gillison 1962, pp. 692</ref><ref name=\"historynet\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-the-bismarck-sea.htm |title=Battle of the Bismarck Sea  |first=Lawrence |last=Spinetta |date=November 2007 |journal=World War II |issn=0898-4204|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Watson, pp. 144-145\">Watson 1950, pp. 144\u2013145.</ref><ref name=\"Gamble 2010 313\">Gamble 2010, p. 310.</ref>\n\n====Isoroku Yamamoto====\n{{Main|Operation Vengeance}}\nThe Lightning figured in one of the most significant operations in the Pacific theater: the interception, on 18 April 1943, of [[Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], the architect of Japan's naval strategy in the Pacific including the attack on Pearl Harbor. When American [[Cryptanalysis|codebreakers]] found out that he was flying to [[Bougainville Island]] to conduct a front-line inspection, 16 P-38G Lightnings were sent on a long-range fighter-intercept mission, flying {{convert|435|mi|km}} from [[Guadalcanal]] at heights of {{convert|10|\u2013|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the ocean to avoid detection. The Lightnings met Yamamoto's two [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" fast bomber transports and six escorting Zeros just as they arrived at the island. The first Betty crashed in the jungle and the second ditched near the coast. Two Zeros were also claimed by the American fighters with the loss of one P-38. Japanese search parties found Yamamoto's body at the jungle crash site the next day.<ref name=\"Stanaway Pacific\">Stanaway 1997, p. 14.</ref>\n\n===Service record===\n[[File:First Lieutenant H. A. Blood examines ammunition.jpg|thumb|Pilot and aircraft armorer inspect ammunition for the central 20 mm cannon]]\nThe P-38's service record shows mixed results, which may reflect more on its employment than on flaws with the aircraft. The P-38's engine troubles at high altitudes only occurred with the Eighth Air Force. One reason for this was the inadequate cooling systems of the G and H models; the improved P-38 J and L had tremendous success flying out of Italy into Germany at all altitudes.<ref name=\"Baugher European\"/> Until the -J-25 variant, P-38s were easily avoided by German fighters because of the lack of dive flaps to counter compressibility in dives. German fighter pilots not wishing to fight would perform the first half of a [[Split S]] and continue into steep dives because they knew the Lightnings would be reluctant to follow.\n\nOn the positive side, having two engines was a built-in insurance policy. Many pilots made it safely back to base after having an engine failure en route or in combat. On 3 March 1944, the first Allied fighters reached Berlin on a frustrated escort mission. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Jenkins of [[55th Fighter Group]] led the group of P-38H pilots, arriving with only half his force after flak damage and engine trouble took their toll. On the way into Berlin, Jenkins reported one rough-running engine, causing him to wonder if he would ever make it back. The B-17s he was supposed to escort never showed up, having turned back at Hamburg. Jenkins and his wingman were able to drop tanks and outrun enemy fighters to return home with three good engines between them.<ref>Bodie 2001, p. 223.</ref>\n\n[[File:P-38 over california.jpg|left|thumb|P-38J ''42-68008'' flying over Southern California.]]\nIn the European Theater, P-38s made 130,000 sorties with a loss of 1.3% overall, comparing favorably with P-51s, which posted a 1.1% loss, considering that the P-38s were vastly outnumbered and suffered from poorly thought-out tactics.

The P-38 was a formidable fighter, interceptor and attack aircraft.\n\nIn the Pacific theater, the P-38 downed over 1,800 Japanese aircraft, with more than 100 pilots becoming aces by downing five or more enemy aircraft.<ref name=\"Stanaway Pacific\"/> American fuel supplies contributed to a better engine performance and maintenance record, and range was increased with leaner mixtures. In the second half of 1944, the P-38L pilots out of Dutch New Guinea were flying {{convert|950|mi|km|abbr=on}}, fighting for fifteen minutes and returning to base.<ref>Bodie 2001, p. 234.</ref> Such long legs were invaluable until the P-47N and P-51D entered service.\n\n===Postwar operations===\nThe end of the war left the USAAF with thousands of P-38s rendered obsolete by the jet age. The last P-38s in service with the United States Air Force were retired in 1949.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090905211847/http://www.bvhcenter.org/P-38-Lightning.html \"P-38 Lightning.\"] ''Bvhcenter.org,'' 9 June 2011.</ref> A total of 100 late-model P-38L and F-5 Lightnings were acquired by Italy through an agreement dated April 1946. Delivered, after refurbishing, at the rate of one per month, they finally were all sent to the [[Aeronautica Militare Italiana|Aeronautica Militare]] by 1952. The Lightnings served in the 4\u00b0 ''Stormo'' and other units including 3\u00b0 ''Stormo'', flying reconnaissance over the Balkans, ground attack, naval cooperation and air superiority missions. Due to old engines, pilot errors and lack of experience in operations, a large number of P-38s were lost in at least 30 accidents, many of them fatal. Despite this, many Italian pilots liked the P-38 because of its excellent visibility on the ground and stability on takeoff. The Italian P-38s were phased out in 1956; none survived the scrapyard.<ref>Sgarlato 2000</ref>\n\nSurplus P-38s were also used by other foreign air forces with 12 sold to [[Honduras]] and 15 retained by China. Six F-5s and two unarmed black two-seater P-38s were operated by the Dominican Air Force based in San Isidro Airbase, Dominican Republic in 1947. The majority of wartime Lightnings present in the continental U.S. at the end of the war were put up for sale for US$1,200 apiece; the rest were scrapped. P-38s in distant theaters of war were bulldozed into piles and abandoned or scrapped; very few avoided that fate.\n\nThe CIA \"Liberation Air Force\" flew one P-38M to support the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat]].

Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was among those who bought a Lightning, choosing a P-38J model and painting it red to make it stand out as an [[Air racing|air racer]] and [[Competition aerobatics|stunt flyer]]. Lefty Gardner, former B-24 and B-17 pilot and associate of the [[Confederate Air Force]], bought a mid-1944 P-38L-1-LO that had been modified into an F-5G. Gardner painted it white with red and blue trim and named it ''White Lightnin{{'}}''; he reworked its turbo systems and intercoolers for optimum low-altitude performance and gave it P-38F style air intakes for better streamlining. ''White Lightnin{{'}}'' was severely damaged in a crash landing following an engine fire on a transit flight and was bought and restored with a brilliant polished aluminum finish by the company that owns [[Red Bull]]. The aircraft is now located in Austria.\n\nF-5s were bought by [[aerial survey]] companies and employed for mapping. From the 1950s on, the use of the Lightning steadily declined, and only a little more than two dozen still exist, with few still flying. One example is a P-38L owned by the [[Lone Star Flight Museum]] in [[Galveston, Texas]], painted in the colors of [[Charles H. MacDonald]]'s ''Putt Putt Maru''. Two other examples are F-5Gs which were owned and operated by Kargl Aerial Surveys in 1946, and are now located in [[Chino, California]] at Yanks Air Museum, and in [[McMinnville, Oregon]] at [[Evergreen Aviation Museum]].

The Lightning had a major effect on other aircraft; its wing, in a scaled-up form, was used on the Lockheed Constellation.<ref name=\"johnson_bio\">[[Clarence Johnson|Johnson, Clarence L. \"Kelly\"]].

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books, 1985. {{ISBN|0-87474-491-1}}.</ref>\n\n===P-38D and P-38Es===\nDelivered and accepted Lightning production variants began with the '''P-38D''' model. The few \"hand made\" YP-38s initially contracted were used as trainers and test aircraft. There were no '''B'''s or '''C'''s delivered to the government as the USAAF allocated the 'D' suffix to all aircraft with self-sealing fuel tanks and armor.<ref name=\"FTDevil\">Caidin, Martin. ''Fork-tailed Devil'', New York: Ballantine Books, 1983. {{ISBN|0-345-31292-9}}.</ref> Many secondary but still initial teething tests were conducted using the earliest D variants.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/>\n\nThe first combat-capable Lightning was the '''P-38E''' (and its photo-recon variant the  '''F-4''') which featured improved instruments, electrical, and hydraulic systems. Part-way through production, the older [[Hamilton Standard]] Hydromatic hollow steel propellers were replaced by new [[Curtiss-Wright#Curtiss Electric propellers|Curtiss Electric duraluminum propellers]]. The definitive (and now famous) armament configuration was settled upon, featuring four .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns with 500 rpg, and a 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404#US production|Hispano]] autocannon with 150 rounds.<ref>Spick 2002, p. 224.</ref>\n\nWhile the machine guns had been arranged symmetrically in the nose on the P-38D, they were \"staggered\" in the P-38E and later versions, with the muzzles protruding from the nose in the relative lengths of roughly 1:4:6:2. This was done to ensure a straight ammunition-belt feed into the weapons, as the earlier arrangement led to jamming.\n\nThe first P-38E rolled out of the factory in October 1941 as the [[Battle of Moscow]] filled the news wires of the world. Because of the versatility, redundant engines, and especially high speed and high altitude characteristics of the aircraft, as with later variants over a hundred P-38Es were completed in the factory or converted in the field to a photoreconnaissance variant, the '''F-4''', in which the guns were replaced by four cameras. Most of these early reconnaissance Lightnings were retained stateside for training, but the F-4 was the first Lightning to be used in action in April 1942.\n\n[[File:Repairs to P-38 by 459th Fighter Squadron at Chittagong, India - January 1945.jpg|left|thumb|Ground crew members of the 459th Fighter Squadron, nicknamed the \"Twin Dragon Squadron\", working on a Lockheed P-38 at an air base in [[Chittagong]], India \u2013 January 1945]]\n\n===P-38Fs and P-38Gs===\nAfter 210 P-38Es were built, they were followed, starting in February 1942, by the '''P-38F''', which incorporated racks inboard of the engines for fuel tanks or a total of {{convert|2000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[bomb]]s. Early variants did not enjoy a high reputation for maneuverability, though they could be agile at low altitudes if flown by a capable pilot, using the P-38's forgiving stall characteristics to their best advantage. From the P-38F-15 model onwards, a \"combat maneuver\" setting was added to the P-38's [[flap (aircraft)|Fowler flaps]]. When deployed at the 8\u00b0 maneuver setting, the flaps allowed the P-38 to out-turn many contemporary single-engined fighters at the cost of some added drag. However, early variants were hampered by high aileron control forces and a low initial rate of roll,<ref name=Eglin1942>[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/p-38/p-38f-tactical-trials.html \"WWII Aircraft Performance: P-38F Tactical Trials\".] ''Final Report on Tactical Suitability of the P-38F Type Airplane'', 6 March 1943. Retrieved: 19 January 2009.</ref> and all such features required a pilot to gain experience with the aircraft,<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> which in part was an additional reason Lockheed sent its representative to England, and later to the Pacific Theater.\n\nThe aircraft was still experiencing extensive teething troubles as well as being victimized by \"urban legends\", mostly involving inapplicable twin engine factors which had been designed out of the aircraft by Lockheed.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> In addition to these, the early versions had a reputation as a \"widow maker\" as it could enter an unrecoverable dive due to a sonic surface effect at high sub-sonic speeds. The 527 P-38Fs were heavier, with more powerful engines that used more fuel, and were unpopular in the air war in Northern Europe.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> Since the heavier engines were having reliability problems and with them, without external fuel tanks, the range of the P-38F was reduced, and since drop tanks themselves were in short supply as the fortunes in the Battle of the Atlantic had not yet swung the Allies' way, the aircraft became relatively unpopular in minds of the bomber command planning staffs despite being the longest ranged fighter first available to the 8th Air Force in sufficient numbers for long range escort duties.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> Nonetheless, [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|General Spaatz]], then commander of the 8th Air Force in the UK, said of the P-38F: \"I'd rather have an airplane that goes like hell and has a few things wrong with it, than one that won't go like hell and has a few things wrong with it.\"<ref name=Lockheed1958/>\n\n[[File:Lockheed P-38G-1-LO Lightning LOC fsa.8d22581.jpg|thumb|left|Lockheed P-38G-1-LO Lightning, serial 42-12723]]\nThe P-38F was followed in June 1942 by the '''P-38G''', using more powerful Allisons of {{convert|1400|hp|kW|abbr=on}} each and equipped with a better radio. A dozen of the planned P-38G production were set aside to serve as prototypes for what would become the P-38J with further uprated Allison V-1710F-17 engines ({{convert|1425|hp|kW|abbr=on}} each) in redesigned booms which featured chin-mounted intercoolers in place of the original system in the leading edge of the wings and more efficient radiators. Lockheed subcontractors, however, were initially unable to supply both of Burbank's twin production lines with a sufficient quantity of new core intercoolers and radiators. War Production Board planners were unwilling to sacrifice production, and one of the two remaining prototypes received the new engines but retained the old leading edge intercoolers and radiators.\n\n[[File:Lockheed P-38H-5-LO 061019-F-1234P-005.jpg|right|thumb|A P-38H]]\n\nAs the '''P-38H''', 600 of these stop-gap Lightnings with an improved 20&nbsp;mm cannon and a bomb capacity of {{convert|3200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} were produced on one line beginning in May 1943 while the near-definitive P-38J began production on the second line in August 1943. The Eighth Air Force was experiencing high altitude and cold weather issues which, while not unique to the aircraft, were perhaps more severe as the [[turbo-supercharger]]s upgrading the Allisons were having their own reliability issues making the aircraft more unpopular with senior officers out of the line.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> This was a situation unduplicated on all other fronts where the commands were clamoring for as many P-38s as they could get.<ref name=\"FTDevil\"/> Both the P-38G and P-38H models' performance was restricted by an intercooler system integral to the wing's leading edge which had been designed for the YP-38's less powerful engines. At the higher boost levels, the new engine's charge air temperature would increase above the limits recommended by Allison and would be subject to detonation if operated at high power for extended periods of time. Reliability was not the only issue, either. For example, the reduced power settings required by the P-38H did not allow the maneuvering flap to be used to good advantage at high altitude.<ref>Bodie 1991, p. 166.</ref> All these problems really came to a head in the unplanned P-38H and sped the Lightning's eventual replacement in the Eighth Air Force; fortunately the Fifteenth Air Force were glad to get them.\n\nSome P-38G production was diverted on the assembly line to '''F-5A''' [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]]. An F-5A was modified to an experimental two-seat reconnaissance configuration as the '''XF-5D''', with a plexiglas nose, two machine guns and additional cameras in the tail booms.\n\n===P-38J, P-38L===\n[[File:4 Lockheed P-38 Lightnings in formation.jpg|left|thumb|Four P-38Hs flying in formation]]\n\nThe '''P-38J''' was introduced in August 1943. The turbo-supercharger [[intercooler]] system on previous variants had been housed in the leading edges of the wings and had proven vulnerable to combat damage and could burst if the wrong series of controls were mistakenly activated. In the P-38J series, the streamlined engine nacelles of previous Lightnings were changed to fit the intercooler radiator between the oil coolers, forming a \"chin\" that visually distinguished the J model from its predecessors. While the P-38J used the same V-1710-89/91 engines as the H model, the new core-type intercooler more efficiently lowered intake manifold temperatures and permitted a substantial increase in rated power. The leading edge of the outer wing was fitted with {{convert|55|gal|l|abbr=on}} fuel tanks, filling the space formerly occupied by intercooler tunnels, but these were omitted on early P-38J blocks due to limited availability.<ref>Bodie 1991, p. 172.</ref>\n\nThe final 210 J models, designated P-38J-25-LO, alleviated the compressibility problem through the addition of a set of electrically actuated dive recovery flaps just outboard of the engines on the bottom centerline of the wings. With these improvements, a USAAF pilot reported a dive speed of almost {{convert|600|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, although the indicated air speed was later corrected for compressibility error, and the actual dive speed was lower.<ref name=\"Baugher P-38J\">Baugher, Joe. [http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/p38_13.html \"Lockheed P-38J Lightning.\"] ''Joe Baugher's Encyclopedia of American Military Aircraft'', 5 June 1999. Retrieved: 29 January 2007.</ref> Lockheed manufactured over 200 retrofit modification kits to be installed on P-38J-10-LO and J-20-LO already in Europe, but the USAAF C-54 carrying them was shot down by an RAF pilot who mistook the Douglas transport for a German Focke-Wulf Condor.<ref>Bodie 1991, p. 208.</ref> Unfortunately, the loss of the kits came during Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier's four-month morale-boosting tour of P-38 bases. Flying a new Lightning named \"Snafuperman\", modified to full P-38J-25-LO specifications at Lockheed's modification center near Belfast, LeVier captured the pilots' full attention by routinely performing maneuvers during March 1944 that common Eighth Air Force wisdom held to be suicidal. It proved too little, too late, because the decision had already been made to re-equip with Mustangs.<ref>Bodie 1991, p. 210.</ref>\n\nThe P-38J-25-LO production block also introduced hydraulically boosted ailerons, one of the first times such a system was fitted to a fighter. This significantly improved the Lightning's rate of roll and reduced control forces for the pilot. This production block and the following P-38L model are considered the definitive Lightnings, and Lockheed ramped up production, working with subcontractors across the country to produce hundreds of Lightnings each month.\n\nThere were two '''P-38K'''s developed from 1942 to 1943, one official and one an internal Lockheed experiment. The first was actually a battered RP-38E \"piggyback\" test mule previously used by Lockheed to test the P-38J chin intercooler installation, now fitted with paddle-bladed \"high activity\" Hamilton Standard Hydromatic propellers similar to those used on the P-47. The new propellers required [[Spinner (aeronautics)|spinners]] of greater diameter, and the mule's crude, hand-formed sheet steel cowlings were further stretched to blend the spinners into the nacelles. It retained its \"piggyback\" configuration that allowed an observer to ride behind the pilot. With Lockheed's AAF representative as a passenger and the maneuvering flap deployed to offset Army Hot Day conditions, the old \"K-Mule\" still climbed to {{convert|45000|ft|m}}. With a fresh coat of paint covering its crude hand-formed steel cowlings, this RP-38E acts as stand-in for the \"P-38K-1-LO\"  in the model's only picture.<ref name=\"Bodie 2001, pp. 169\u2013171\">Bodie 2001, pp. 169\u2013171.</ref>\n\nThe 12th G model originally set aside as a P-38J prototype was re-designated P-38K-1-LO and fitted with the aforementioned paddle-blade propellers and new Allison V-1710-75/77 (F15R/L) powerplants rated at {{convert|1875|bhp|abbr=on}} at War Emergency Power. These engines were geared 2.36 to 1, unlike the standard P-38 ratio of 2 to 1. The AAF took delivery in September 1943, at [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin Field]]. In tests, the P-38K-1 achieved {{convert|432|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at military power and was predicted to exceed {{convert|450|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at War Emergency Power with a similar increase in load and range. The initial climb rate was {{convert|4800|ft|m|abbr=on}}/min and the ceiling was {{convert|46000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. It reached {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}} in five minutes flat; this with a coat of camouflage paint which added weight and drag. Although it was judged superior in climb and speed to the latest and best fighters from all AAF manufacturers, the War Production Board refused to authorize P-38K production due to the two-to-three-week interruption in production necessary to implement cowling modifications for the revised [[Spinner (aeronautics)|spinners]] and higher thrust line.<ref name=\"Bodie 2001, pp. 169\u2013171\"/> Some have also doubted Allison's ability to deliver the F15 engine in quantity.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071021024320/http://www.p-38online.com/p38k.html \"P38K.\"] ''P-38 Lightning online,'' 21 October 2007. Retrieved: 6 February 2009.</ref> As promising as it had looked, the P-38K project came to a halt.\n\nThe '''P-38L''' was the most numerous variant of the Lightning, with 3,923 built, 113 by [[Consolidated-Vultee]] in their [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] plant. It entered service with the [[USAAF]] in June 1944, in time to support the Allied invasion of France on [[D-Day]]. Lockheed production of the Lightning was distinguished by a suffix consisting of a production block number followed by \"LO,\" for example \"P-38L-1-LO\", while Consolidated-Vultee production was distinguished by a block number followed by \"VN,\" for example \"P-38L-5-VN.\"\n\nThe P-38L was the first Lightning fitted with zero-length rocket launchers. Seven [[high velocity aircraft rocket]]s (HVARs) on pylons beneath each wing, and later, five rockets on each wing on \"Christmas tree\" launch racks which added {{convert|1365|lb|kg|abbr=on}} to the aircraft.<ref>Cross 1968</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2015}} The P-38L also had strengthened stores pylons to allow carriage of {{convert|2000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}} bombs or {{convert|300|gal|l|-2|abbr=on}} drop tanks.\n\n[[File:F-5A Lightning.jpg|thumb|F-5A Lightning of the 7th Photo Group, 8th Air Force based at [[RAF Mount Farm|Mount Farm]]. The national insignia was bordered in red with overall finish in synthetic haze.]]\n\nLockheed modified 200 P-38J airframes in production to become unarmed '''F-5B''' photo-reconnaissance aircraft, while hundreds of other P-38Js and P-38Ls were modified at Lockheed's Dallas Modification Center to become '''F-5C'''s, '''F-5E'''s, '''F-5F'''s, or '''F-5G'''s. A few P-38Ls were field-modified to become two-seat '''TP-38L''' familiarization trainers. During and after June 1948, the remaining J and L variants were designated ZF-38J and ZF-38L, with the \"ZF\" designator (meaning \"obsolete fighter\") replacing the \"P for Pursuit\" category.\n\nLate model Lightnings were delivered unpainted, as per USAAF policy established in 1944. At first, field units tried to paint them, since pilots worried about being too visible to the enemy, but it turned out the reduction in weight and drag was a minor advantage in combat.\n\nThe P-38L-5, the most common sub-variant of the P-38L, had a modified cockpit heating system consisting of a plug-socket in the cockpit into which the pilot could plug his heat-suit wire for improved comfort. These Lightnings also received the uprated V-1710-112/113 (F30R/L) engines, and this dramatically lowered the amount of engine failure problems experienced at high altitude so commonly associated with European operations.\n\n===Pathfinders, night-fighter and other variants===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2011}}\nThe Lightning was modified for other roles.

The floats would be removed before the aircraft went into combat. There were concerns that saltwater spray would corrode the tailplane, and so in March 1942, P-38E ''41-1986'' was modified with a tailplane raised some {{convert|16|\u2013|18|in|cm|abbr=on}}, booms lengthened by two feet and a rearward-facing second seat added for an observer to monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangement. A second version was crafted on the same airframe with the twin booms given greater sideplane area to augment the vertical rudders. This arrangement was removed and a final third version was fabricated that had the booms returned to normal length but the tail raised {{convert|33|in|cm|abbr=on}}. All three tail modifications were designed by George H. \"Bert\" Estabrook. The final version was used for a quick series of dive tests on 7 December 1942 in which Milo Burcham performed the test maneuvers and Kelly Johnson observed from the rear seat. Johnson concluded that the raised floatplane tail gave no advantage in solving the problem of compressibility. At no time was this P-38E testbed airframe actually fitted with floats, and the idea was quickly abandoned as the U.S. Navy proved to have enough [[sealift]] capacity to keep up with P-38 deliveries to the South Pacific.<ref name=\"Bodie p. 32\">Bodie 2001, pp. 118\u2013121.</ref>\n\nStill another P-38E was used in 1942 to tow a [[CG-4 Hadrian|Waco troop glider]] as a demonstration. However, there proved to be plenty of other aircraft, such as [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s, available to tow gliders, and the Lightning was spared this duty.\n\nStandard Lightnings were used as crew and cargo transports in the South Pacific. They were fitted with pods attached to the underwing pylons, replacing drop tanks or bombs, that could carry a single passenger in a lying-down position, or cargo. This was a very uncomfortable way to fly. Some of the pods were not even fitted with a window to let the passenger see out or bring in light.\n\nLockheed proposed a carrier-based '''Model 822''' version of the Lightning for the [[United States Navy]]. The Model 822 would have featured folding wings, an arresting hook, and stronger undercarriage for carrier operations. The navy was not interested, as they regarded the Lightning as too big for carrier operations and did not like liquid-cooled engines anyway, and the Model 822 never went beyond the paper stage. However, the navy did operate four land-based F-5Bs in North Africa, inherited from the USAAF and redesignated '''FO-1'''.\n\nA P-38J was used in experiments with an unusual scheme for [[Aerial refueling|mid-air refueling]], in which the fighter snagged a drop tank trailed on a cable from a bomber. The USAAF managed to make this work, but decided it was not practical. A P-38J was also fitted with experimental retractable snow ski landing gear, but this idea never reached operational service either.\n\nAfter the war, a P-38L was experimentally fitted with armament of three .60&nbsp;in (15.2&nbsp;mm) machine guns. The .60&nbsp;in (15.2&nbsp;mm) caliber cartridge had been developed early in the war for an infantry [[anti-tank rifle]], a type of weapon developed by a number of nations in the 1930s when tanks were lighter but, by 1942, armor was too tough for this caliber.\n\nAnother P-38L was modified after the war as a \"super strafer,\" with eight .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns in the nose and a pod under each wing with two .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns, for a total of 12 machine guns. Nothing came of this conversion either.\n\n==Variants==\n;XP-38\n:United States Army Air Force designation for one prototype Lockheed Model 22 first flown in 1939.<ref name=\"andrade146\">Andrade 1979, pp. 146\u2013147</ref>\n;YP-38\n:Redesigned pre-production batch with armament, 13 built.<ref name=\"andrade146\" />\n;P-38\n:First production variant with 0.5 in guns and a 37 mm cannon, 30 built.<ref name=\"andrade146\" /><ref name=\"kinzey33\">Kinzey 1998, pp. 33</ref>\n;XP-38A\n:Thirtieth P-38 modified with a pressurised cockpit.<ref name=\"andrade146\" /><ref name=\"kinzey33\" />\n;Lightning I\n:Former Arm\u00e9e de l'air order for 667 aircraft (being reduced to 143 Lighting I's) which was taken by the Royal Air Force.

This and other aircraft were used by a handful of Lockheed test pilots including [[Milo Burcham]], [[Jimmie Mattern]] and [[Anthony LeVier|Tony LeVier]] in remarkable flight demonstrations, performing such stunts as slow rolls at treetop level with one prop feathered to dispel the myth that the P-38 was unmanageable.<ref>Cefaratt 2002, pp. 15, 39, 141.</ref><ref>Frey [https://books.google.com/books?id=P0KiPMJuXkUC&pg=PA61 2004, p. 61.]</ref>\n\n===Glacier Girl===\n{{main|Glacier Girl}}\nOn 15 July 1942, a flight of six P-38s and two B-17 bombers, with a total of 25 crew members on board, took off from Presque Isle Air Base in Maine headed for the UK. What followed was a harrowing and life-threatening landing of the entire squadron on a remote ice cap in Greenland. None of the crew was lost and they were all rescued and returned safely home after spending several days on the ice.\n\nFifty years later a small group of aviation enthusiasts decided to locate those aircraft, which had come to be known as \"The Lost Squadron\", and to recover one of the lost P-38s. It turned out to be no easy task, as the planes had been buried under 25 stories of ice and drifted over a mile from their original location. The recovered P-38, dubbed \"Glacier Girl\", was eventually restored to airworthiness.\n\n==='Maid of Harlech'===\nThis plane crashed in September 1942, and is buried in the sea off the coast of Harlech, Wales, United Kingdom. It has been granted protected status in November 2019 for its historic and archaeological interest by [[Cadw]].<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/12/ww2-wreck-of-fighter-plane-off-welsh-coast-gets-protected-status</ref>\n\n==Surviving aircraft==\n{{Main|List of surviving Lockheed P-38 Lightnings}}\n\n==Noted P-38 pilots==\n\n===Richard Bong and Thomas McGuire===\n[[File:Richard Bong in cockpit.jpg|thumb|Major [[Richard Bong]] in his P-38.]]\n\nThe American ace of aces and his closest competitor both flew Lightnings and tallied 40 and 38 victories respectively. Majors [[Richard Bong|Richard I. \"Dick\" Bong]] and [[Thomas McGuire|Thomas B. \"Tommy\" McGuire]] of the USAAF competed for the top position. Both men were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].\n\nMcGuire was killed in air combat in January 1945 over the [[Philippines]], after accumulating 38 confirmed kills, making him the second-ranking American ace. Bong was rotated back to the United States as America's ace of aces, after making 40 kills, becoming a test pilot. He was killed on 6 August 1945, the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan, when his [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]] jet fighter flamed out on [[takeoff]].\n\n[[File:Thomas B. McGuire (L) and Charles Lindbergh (R).jpg|thumb|upright|(L\u2013R) [[Thomas B. McGuire]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]] discussing a mission on Biak Island in July 1944.]]\n\n===Charles Lindbergh===\nThe famed aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] toured the South Pacific as a civilian contractor for [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation|United Aircraft Corporation]], comparing and evaluating performance of single- and twin-engined fighters for [[Vought]]. He worked to improve range and load limits of the [[Vought F4U Corsair]], flying both routine and combat strafing missions in Corsairs alongside [[United States Marine Corps Aviation|Marine]] pilots.\n\nEverywhere Lindbergh went in the South Pacific, he was accorded the normal preferential treatment of a visiting colonel, although he had resigned his Air Corps Reserve colonel's commission three years before. In Hollandia, Lindbergh attached himself to the 475th FG, flying P-38s. Although new to the aircraft, Lindbergh was instrumental in extending the range of the P-38 through improved throttle settings, or engine-leaning techniques, notably by reducing engine speed to 1,600&nbsp;rpm, setting the carburetors for auto-lean and flying at {{convert|185|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[indicated airspeed]] which reduced fuel consumption to 70&nbsp;gal/h, about 2.6&nbsp;mpg. This combination of settings had been considered dangerous and would upset the fuel mixture, causing an explosion.<ref>Kirkland 2003, pp. 29\u201335.</ref>\n\nWhile with the 475th, he held training classes and took part in a number of Army Air Corps combat missions. On 28 July 1944, Lindbergh shot down a [[Mitsubishi Ki-51]] \"Sonia\" flown by the veteran commander of 73rd Independent Flying [[Chutaicho|Chutai]], [[Imperial Japanese Army]] Captain Saburo Shimada. In an extended, twisting dogfight in which many of the participants ran out of ammunition, Shimada turned his aircraft directly toward Lindbergh who was just approaching the combat area. Lindbergh fired in a defensive reaction brought on by Shimada's apparent head-on [[Aerial ramming|ramming attack]]. Hit by cannon and machine gun fire, the \"Sonia's\" propeller visibly slowed, but Shimada held his course. Lindbergh pulled up at the last moment to avoid collision as the damaged \"Sonia\" went into a steep dive, hit the ocean and sank. Lindbergh's wingman, ace Joseph E. \"Fishkiller\" Miller, Jr., had also scored hits on the \"Sonia\" after it had begun its fatal dive, but Miller was certain the kill credit was Lindbergh's. The unofficial kill was not entered in the 475th's war record. On 12 August 1944, Lindbergh left Hollandia to return to the United States.<ref>[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/wwii/ \"Charles Lindbergh and the 475th Fighter Group.\"]  ''Lightning Strikes''.
