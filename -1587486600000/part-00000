Docherty played for several clubs, most notably [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], and represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] 25 times between 1951 and 1959. He then managed a total of 13 clubs between 1961 and 1988, as well as managing the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish national team]]. Docherty was manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] between 1972 and 1977, during which time United were relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] but promoted back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] as Champions at the first attempt.\n\n==Playing career==\nBorn in [[Gorbals]], [[Glasgow]], Docherty began his playing career when he joined [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior football]] club [[Shettleston F.C.|Shettleston]]. The turning point in his playing career came in 1946 when he was called up for [[National service]] in the [[Highland Light Infantry]].<ref name=\"thewolvessite1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thewolvessite.co.uk/managers.htm |title=Wolves Managers From 1885 to Today |publisher=Thewolvessite.co.uk |accessdate=21 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002192056/http://www.thewolvessite.co.uk/managers.htm |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> While completing his National service, Docherty represented the British Army at football. On demobilisation, Docherty was offered a contract with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in 1947. He would later say that [[Jimmy Hogan]], the club's coach, was his greatest influence.<ref name=\"Total Football\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/nov/22/sport.comment2|title=How total football inventor was lost to Hungary|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 September 2010|date=22 November 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1949, after spending over two years with Celtic, he joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. With the Lilywhites he won the [[1950-51 Football League Second Division|1951]] [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title and got to the [[1954 FA Cup Final]]. Altogether Docherty made close to 300 appearances for the club.<ref name=View>{{cite web|url=https://www.lep.co.uk/sport/football/the-big-interview-tommy-docherty-1-137886|title=The Big Interview: Tommy Docherty|website=LEP.co.uk}}</ref> He left Deepdale in August of that year to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for \u00a328,000. With the Gunners he made a sum of 83 appearances scoring once. He then went to play for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] where he brought an end to his playing days in 1962.<ref name=AFC>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/historic/players/tommy-docherty|title=Tommy Docherty|website=Arsenal.com}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nAt Preston Docherty received the first of his 25 full [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international [[cap (sport)|caps]]. Docherty was part of the Scotland squad that played at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] finals which was hosted in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/football_player_profile.cfm?page=2492&playerID=113141&squadID=1|title=Tommy Docherty|website=Scottish FA.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Chelsea===\nIn February 1961, Docherty was offered the post of player-coach of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Less than twelve months later, upon [[Ted Drake]]'s departure and with the club facing [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] from the top flight, Docherty took over as manager. He was unable to keep the club in the First Division, however, and the team was relegated at the end of the [[1961\u201362 in English football|1961\u201362]] season.\n\nDuring his first year in charge he sold many of the club's older players and brought in new ones such as [[Terry Venables]], [[Bobby Tambling]], [[Peter Bonetti]] and [[Barry Bridges]]. He also changed the club's home colours, switching from white shorts to blue shorts, the combination that remains as of 2018. The team, nicknamed \"Docherty's Diamonds\", achieved promotion back to Division One in their first attempt and finished fifth the following year. In [[1964\u201365 in English football|1964\u201365]], Chelsea won the [[1965 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] in April with an [[Aggregate score|aggregate]] win over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], but were beaten 2\u20130 by eventual winner [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the FA Cup semi-final.\n\nDocherty led Chelsea to the FA and the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] semi-finals a year later, before reaching the [[1967 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] in 1967, which they lost to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. He resigned in October 1967. The core of the team Docherty had put together, including [[Peter Osgood]], [[Charlie Cooke]], [[Ron Harris (footballer)|Ron Harris]], Bonetti and [[John Hollins]], went on to win the FA Cup and [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] under Docherty's successor, [[Dave Sexton]]. Sexton succeeded Docherty as manager of Manchester United a decade later.\n\n===Rotherham, QPR, Aston Villa, Porto and Scotland===\nThe month following his departure from Chelsea, Docherty became manager of [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]. He left Rotherham after a year and was appointed manager at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], only to leave 29 days later. He then became [[Doug Ellis]]' first manager at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in December 1968, for 13 months. On 19 January 1970, with Aston Villa bottom of the Second Division, Docherty was sacked.\n\nFrom there he went to [[F.C. Porto|FC Porto]], where he stayed for 16 months before resigning in May 1971, having failed to usurp [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]]. On 2 July 1971, he was appointed by [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] as assistant manager to [[Terry Neill]], but on 12 September he left to become the caretaker manager of [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], with the position becoming permanent in November 1971.<ref name=View@>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/scotland/27629084|title=Tommy Docherty still regrets leaving Scotland for Man Utd|website=BBC.com}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester United===\nIn December 1972, when [[Frank O'Farrell]] was sacked as manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], Docherty was poached by Manchester United and quit his job with [[Scottish national football team|Scotland]] to become manager. His first game in charge was against Leeds United at Old Trafford. The game finished 1\u20131 with Ted MacDougall scoring one of his few goals for United. Although United were in serious trouble when he took them over, because of an ageing squad, he managed to keep them in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]]. The [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374 season]] saw United continue to struggle and they were eventually relegated to the Second Division.<ref name=View /><ref name=View@ /><ref name=View2 />\n\nIn the following season, United returned to the top flight as Second Division champions. In [[1975\u201376 in English football|1975\u201376]] they finished in third place in the First Division and also reached the [[1976 FA Cup Final]]. United lost 1\u20130 to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], who were then in the Second Division. Docherty led United to the FA Cup final again in [[1977 FA Cup Final|1977]], this time as underdogs against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. United won 2\u20131, denying Liverpool the second trophy of a possible treble of League, FA Cup and European Cup.<ref name=View /><ref name=View@ /><ref name=View2 />\n\nShortly afterwards, news that Docherty was having an extramarital affair with the wife of a United [[Physical therapy|physiotherapist]], Laurie Brown, became public. He was sacked in a blaze of publicity in July 1977. Docherty was replaced at Old Trafford by the same man who had replaced him at Chelsea, [[Dave Sexton]]. The affair also resulted in the end of his marriage to Agnes, who had been his wife since December 1949. She has since died. Docherty later married Mary Brown, and the couple are still together. Docherty has subsequently had a frosty relationship with the club.<ref name=View /><ref name=View2>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14998278.The_Doc_will_see_you_now__Tommy_Docherty_on_returning_to_Glasgow__his_Celtic_memories_and_why_he_won__39_t_be_back_at_Old_Trafford/|title=The Doc will see you now: Tommy Docherty on returning to Glasgow, his Celtic memories and why he won't be back at Old Trafford|website=Herald Scotland.com}}</ref><ref name=View@ />\n\n===Later career===\nDocherty became manager at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in September 1977, where he stayed for two seasons before resigning in May 1979. His next appointment was at Queens Park Rangers in May 1979. When he took over at [[Loftus Road]], Rangers had been relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] (three years after almost winning the league title) and Docherty had to lift the team spirits to start the new season. New players such as [[Clive Allen]], [[Tony Currie (footballer)|Tony Currie]] and [[Paul Goddard]] were brought in. Despite this, Docherty had a quick fallout with Queens Park Rangers's star player, [[Stan Bowles]]. Docherty made Bowles train with the reserves for several months, before selling him on to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in December 1979. Although money was spent, Queens Park Rangers finished the season four points short of promotion to the First Division. In May 1980, Docherty was sacked by chairman, Jim Gregory, then reinstated after just nine days away. In October 1980, Docherty was sacked for the second time in five months.\n\nThis was followed by a short spell in Australia coaching [[Sydney Olympic Football Club|Sydney Olympic]] in 1981. He returned to England in July that year to manage [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], where he had spent nine years as a player. He left after a few months, returning to Australia to manage [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] until the following year. He also managed Sydney Olympic again in 1983.\n\nDocherty returned to England once more with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] just after their relegation from the First Division in 1984. He was sacked within a year, however, as Wolves headed for a second successive relegation, eventually going on to suffer three relegations in a row. Their [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385 season]] had included a 21-match winless run in the league.<ref name=\"thewolvessite1\"/> Docherty took up his final managerial position at [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]] on 28 September 1987. He retired from management at the end of the [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388 season]].\n\n==Personal life==\nDocherty married his first wife, Agnes, in 1950, the year after he left his native Scotland to sign for Preston North End. They were married for 27 years until Docherty announced his love affair with Mary Brown. They had four children together; Thomas junior, Michael [[Mick Docherty|\"Mick\"]] (himself a former professional footballer and manager), Catherine and Peter. Since the collapse of his first marriage, he has only had regular contact with Mick out of the four children from that marriage. After marrying Mary Brown, he had two more children \u2013 Grace and Lucy \u2013 who were born during the 1980s. Agnes died in September 2002 at the age of 73.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J5dVTfElhdIC&pg=PT280&lpg=PT280&dq=tommy+docherty+%22past+tense%22&source=bl&ots=gz2Nh3uPv0&sig=ACfU3U3F-wUHhjp3FnUY5rw-R8ep8dyqEg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiv-_a2lIbnAhUwQRUIHcXOCtAQ6AEwA3oECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=tommy%20docherty%20%22past%20tense%22&f=false]</ref>

Docherty played for several clubs, most notably [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], and represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] 25 times between 1951 and 1959. He then managed a total of 13 clubs between 1961 and 1988, as well as managing the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish national team]]. Docherty was manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] between 1972 and 1977, during which time United were relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] but promoted back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] as Champions at the first attempt.\n\n==Playing career==\nBorn in [[Gorbals]], [[Glasgow]], Docherty began his playing career when he joined [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior football]] club [[Shettleston F.C.|Shettleston]]. The turning point in his playing career came in 1946 when he was called up for [[National service]] in the [[Highland Light Infantry]].<ref name=\"thewolvessite1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thewolvessite.co.uk/managers.htm |title=Wolves Managers From 1885 to Today |publisher=Thewolvessite.co.uk |accessdate=21 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002192056/http://www.thewolvessite.co.uk/managers.htm |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> While completing his National service, Docherty represented the British Army at football. On demobilisation, Docherty was offered a contract with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in 1947. He would later say that [[Jimmy Hogan]], the club's coach, was his greatest influence.<ref name=\"Total Football\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/nov/22/sport.comment2|title=How total football inventor was lost to Hungary|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 September 2010|date=22 November 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1949, after spending over two years with Celtic, he joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. With the Lilywhites he won the [[1950-51 Football League Second Division|1951]] [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title and got to the [[1954 FA Cup Final]]. Altogether Docherty made close to 300 appearances for the club.<ref name=View>{{cite web|url=https://www.lep.co.uk/sport/football/the-big-interview-tommy-docherty-1-137886|title=The Big Interview: Tommy Docherty|website=LEP.co.uk}}</ref> He left Deepdale in August of that year to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for \u00a328,000. With the Gunners he made a sum of 83 appearances scoring once. He then went to play for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] where he brought an end to his playing days in 1962.<ref name=AFC>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/historic/players/tommy-docherty|title=Tommy Docherty|website=Arsenal.com}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nAt Preston Docherty received the first of his 25 full [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international [[cap (sport)|caps]]. Docherty was part of the Scotland squad that played at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] finals which was hosted in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/football_player_profile.cfm?page=2492&playerID=113141&squadID=1|title=Tommy Docherty|website=Scottish FA.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Chelsea===\nIn February 1961, Docherty was offered the post of player-coach of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Less than twelve months later, upon [[Ted Drake]]'s departure and with the club facing [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] from the top flight, Docherty took over as manager. He was unable to keep the club in the First Division, however, and the team was relegated at the end of the [[1961\u201362 in English football|1961\u201362]] season.\n\nDuring his first year in charge he sold many of the club's older players and brought in new ones such as [[Terry Venables]], [[Bobby Tambling]], [[Peter Bonetti]] and [[Barry Bridges]]. He also changed the club's home colours, switching from white shorts to blue shorts, the combination that remains as of 2018. The team, nicknamed \"Docherty's Diamonds\", achieved promotion back to Division One in their first attempt and finished fifth the following year. In [[1964\u201365 in English football|1964\u201365]], Chelsea won the [[1965 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] in April with an [[Aggregate score|aggregate]] win over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], but were beaten 2\u20130 by eventual winner [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the FA Cup semi-final.\n\nDocherty led Chelsea to the FA and the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] semi-finals a year later, before reaching the [[1967 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] in 1967, which they lost to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. He resigned in October 1967. The core of the team Docherty had put together, including [[Peter Osgood]], [[Charlie Cooke]], [[Ron Harris (footballer)|Ron Harris]], Bonetti and [[John Hollins]], went on to win the FA Cup and [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] under Docherty's successor, [[Dave Sexton]]. Sexton succeeded Docherty as manager of Manchester United a decade later.\n\n===Rotherham, QPR, Aston Villa, Porto and Scotland===\nThe month following his departure from Chelsea, Docherty became manager of [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]. He left Rotherham after a year and was appointed manager at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], only to leave 29 days later. He then became [[Doug Ellis]]' first manager at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in December 1968, for 13 months. On 19 January 1970, with Aston Villa bottom of the Second Division, Docherty was sacked.\n\nFrom there he went to [[F.C. Porto|FC Porto]], where he stayed for 16 months before resigning in May 1971, having failed to usurp [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]]. On 2 July 1971, he was appointed by [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] as assistant manager to [[Terry Neill]], but on 12 September he left to become the caretaker manager of [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], with the position becoming permanent in November 1971.<ref name=View@>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/scotland/27629084|title=Tommy Docherty still regrets leaving Scotland for Man Utd|website=BBC.com}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester United===\nIn December 1972, when [[Frank O'Farrell]] was sacked as manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], Docherty was poached by Manchester United and quit his job with [[Scottish national football team|Scotland]] to become manager. His first game in charge was against Leeds United at Old Trafford. The game finished 1\u20131 with Ted MacDougall scoring one of his few goals for United. Although United were in serious trouble when he took them over, because of an ageing squad, he managed to keep them in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]]. The [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374 season]] saw United continue to struggle and they were eventually relegated to the Second Division.<ref name=View /><ref name=View@ /><ref name=View2 />\n\nIn the following season, United returned to the top flight as Second Division champions. In [[1975\u201376 in English football|1975\u201376]] they finished in third place in the First Division and also reached the [[1976 FA Cup Final]]. United lost 1\u20130 to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], who were then in the Second Division. Docherty led United to the FA Cup final again in [[1977 FA Cup Final|1977]], this time as underdogs against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. United won 2\u20131, denying Liverpool the second trophy of a possible treble of League, FA Cup and European Cup.<ref name=View /><ref name=View@ /><ref name=View2 />\n\nShortly afterwards, news that Docherty was having an extramarital affair with the wife of a United [[Physical therapy|physiotherapist]], Laurie Brown, became public. He was sacked in a blaze of publicity in July 1977. Docherty was replaced at Old Trafford by the same man who had replaced him at Chelsea, [[Dave Sexton]]. The affair also resulted in the end of his marriage to Agnes, who had been his wife since December 1949. She has since died. Docherty later married Mary Brown, and the couple are still together. Docherty has subsequently had a frosty relationship with the club.<ref name=View /><ref name=View2>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14998278.The_Doc_will_see_you_now__Tommy_Docherty_on_returning_to_Glasgow__his_Celtic_memories_and_why_he_won__39_t_be_back_at_Old_Trafford/|title=The Doc will see you now: Tommy Docherty on returning to Glasgow, his Celtic memories and why he won't be back at Old Trafford|website=Herald Scotland.com}}</ref><ref name=View@ />\n\n===Later career===\nDocherty became manager at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in September 1977, where he stayed for two seasons before resigning in May 1979. His next appointment was at Queens Park Rangers in May 1979. When he took over at [[Loftus Road]], Rangers had been relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] (three years after almost winning the league title) and Docherty had to lift the team spirits to start the new season. New players such as [[Clive Allen]], [[Tony Currie (footballer)|Tony Currie]] and [[Paul Goddard]] were brought in. Despite this, Docherty had a quick fallout with Queens Park Rangers's star player, [[Stan Bowles]]. Docherty made Bowles train with the reserves for several months, before selling him on to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in December 1979. Although money was spent, Queens Park Rangers finished the season four points short of promotion to the First Division. In May 1980, Docherty was sacked by chairman, Jim Gregory, then reinstated after just nine days away. In October 1980, Docherty was sacked for the second time in five months.\n\nThis was followed by a short spell in Australia coaching [[Sydney Olympic Football Club|Sydney Olympic]] in 1981. He returned to England in July that year to manage [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], where he had spent nine years as a player. He left after a few months, returning to Australia to manage [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] until the following year. He also managed Sydney Olympic again in 1983.\n\nDocherty returned to England once more with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] just after their relegation from the First Division in 1984. He was sacked within a year, however, as Wolves headed for a second successive relegation, eventually going on to suffer three relegations in a row. Their [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385 season]] had included a 21-match winless run in the league.<ref name=\"thewolvessite1\"/> Docherty took up his final managerial position at [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]] on 28 September 1987. He retired from management at the end of the [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388 season]].\n\n==Personal life==\nDocherty married his first wife, Agnes, in 1950, the year after he left his native Scotland to sign for Preston North End. They were married for 27 years until Docherty announced his love affair with Mary Brown. They had four children together; Thomas junior, Michael [[Mick Docherty|\"Mick\"]] (himself a former professional footballer and manager), Catherine and Peter. Since the collapse of his first marriage, he has only had regular contact with Mick out of the four children from that marriage. After marrying Mary Brown, he had two more children - Grace and Lucy - who were born during the 1980s. Agnes died in September 2002 at the age of 73.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J5dVTfElhdIC&pg=PT280&lpg=PT280&dq=tommy+docherty+%22past+tense%22&source=bl&ots=gz2Nh3uPv0&sig=ACfU3U3F-wUHhjp3FnUY5rw-R8ep8dyqEg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiv-_a2lIbnAhUwQRUIHcXOCtAQ6AEwA3oECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=tommy%20docherty%20%22past%20tense%22&f=false]</ref> In 2008, Docherty junior released a book ''Married to a Man of Two Halves'' in 2008, which was based on memoirs and newspaper cuttings which he had discovered when clearing out his mother's house after her death.<ref>http://www.sportsbookofthemonth.com/?page=showreviews&book_id=260</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Player===\n;Preston North End<ref name=AFC />\n*[[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]: [[1950\u201351 Football League Second Division|1950\u201351]]\n\n===Managerial===\n;Chelsea<ref name=LMA>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/tommy-docherty/|title=Tommy Docherty|website=League Managers.com}}</ref>\n*[[Football League Cup]]: [[1964\u201365 Football League Cup|1964\u201365]]\n\n;Manchester United<ref name=LMA />\n*[[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]: [[1974\u201375 Football League Second Division|1974\u201375]]\n*[[FA Cup]]: [[1976\u201377 FA Cup|1976\u201377]]\n\n===Individual===\n*[[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]]: 2013<ref name=HOF>{{cite web|url=http://scottishfootballhalloffame.co.uk/tommy-docherty/|title=Tommy Docherty|website=Scottish Football Hall of Fame.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Soccerbase}}\n* {{NeilBrownPlayers|player/tommydocherty}}\n* {{soccerbase (manager)|id=1232|name=Tommy Docherty}}\n\n{{Scottish Football Hall of Fame}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Scotland squads\n| bg = #0C1C8C\n| fg = #FFFFFF\n| bordercolor = silver\n| list1 = \n{{Scotland squad 1954 FIFA World Cup}}\n{{Scotland squad 1958 FIFA World Cup}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Managerial positions\n| list1 = \n{{Chelsea F.C. managers}}\n{{Rotherham United F.C. managers}}\n{{Queens Park Rangers F.C. managers}}\n{{Aston Villa F.C. managers}}\n{{FC Porto managers}}\n{{Scotland national football team managers}}\n{{Manchester United F.C. managers}}\n{{Derby County F.C. managers}}\n{{Preston North End F.C. managers}}\n{{South Melbourne FC managers}}\n{{Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. managers}}\n{{Altrincham F.C. managers}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Docherty, Tommy}}\n[[Category:1928 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Altrincham F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Arsenal F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Association football wing halves]]\n[[Category:Aston Villa F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Celtic F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Chelsea F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Chelsea F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Derby County F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:FC Porto managers]]\n[[Category:Manchester United F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Preston North End F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Rotherham United F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Scotland B international footballers]]\n[[Category:Scotland international footballers]]\n[[Category:Scotland national football team managers]]\n[[Category:Scottish Football League players]]\n[[Category:Scottish footballers]]\n[[Category:Scottish football managers]]\n[[Category:Scottish expatriate football managers]]\n[[Category:Shettleston F.C. players]]\n[[Category:South Melbourne FC managers]]\n[[Category:Footballers from Glasgow]]\n[[Category:English Football League managers]]\n[[Category:English Football League players]]\n[[Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:1954 FIFA World Cup players]]\n[[Category:1958 FIFA World Cup players]]\n[[Category:Scottish Football Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:People from Gorbals]]\n[[Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players]]\n", "name_user": "Kind Tennis Fan", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor edit.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Docherty"}

AAU membership is by invitation and requires an affirmative vote of three-quarters of current members.\n\n==Organization==\nThe AAU was founded on February 28, 1900, by a group of 14 [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree\u2013granting universities{{efn|The Association of American Universities was founded by [[University of California]], [[Catholic University of America]].

Lack of standardization damaged European universities' opinions of their American counterparts, however, and many American students attended [[graduate school]] in Europe instead of staying in the U.S. The presidents of Johns Hopkins University, [[University of Chicago]], [[Columbia University]], [[Harvard University]], and [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] sent a letter of invitation to nine other universities to meet at Chicago in February 1900 to promote and raise standards.<ref>\"[https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/AAU%20Files/Key%20Issues/Budget%20%26%20Appropriations/FY17/Invit.pdf The Letter of Invitation to the Founding Conference of AAU]\".

''The Baltimore Sun';. March 1, 1900. p. 2.</ref>\n\nIn 1914, the AAU began [[higher education accreditation in the United States|accrediting undergraduate education]] at its member and other schools. German universities used the \"AAU Accepted List\" to determine whether a college's graduates were qualified for graduate programs. [[Regional accreditation]] agencies existed in the U.S. by the 1920s, and the AAU ended accrediting schools in 1948.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.aau.edu/association-american-universities-century-service-higher-education-1900-2000 |title=The Association of American Universities: A Century of Service to Higher Education 1900-2000 |publisher=Association of American Universities |access-date=2018-02-25}}</ref>\n\nThe AAU is made up of universities of varying sizes and missions who are committed to research. Today, 65 universities in the U.S. and Canada are members and the primary purpose of the organization is to provide a forum for the development and implementation of institutional and national policies, in order to promote strong programs in academic research and scholarship and undergraduate, graduate, and professional education.\n\n===Benefits===\nThe largest attraction of the AAU for many schools, especially nonmembers, is prestige. For example, in 2010 the chancellor of nonmember [[North Carolina State University]] described it as \"the pre-eminent research-intensive membership group.

Founded in 1900, it consists of 63 [[universities in the United States]] (both [[State university system (United States)|public]] and [[private university|private]]) and 2 [[universities in Canada]].  AAU membership is by invitation and requires an affirmative vote of three-quarters of current members.\n\n==Organization==\nThe AAU was founded on February 28, 1900, by a group of 14 [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree\u2013granting universities{{efn|The Association of American Universities was founded by [[University of California]], [[Catholic University of America]]. [[The University of Chicago]], [[Clark University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Cornell University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[University of Michigan]], [[Princeton University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Wisconsin]], and [[Yale University]], all of which were its first members.<ref name= cooperate/>}} in the United States to strengthen and standardize American doctoral programs.<ref name= cooperate/> American universities\u2014starting with [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1876\u2014were adopting the research-intensive German model of higher education. Lack of standardization damaged European universities' opinions of their American counterparts, however, and many American students attended [[graduate school]] in Europe instead of staying in the U.S. The presidents of Johns Hopkins University, [[University of Chicago]], [[Columbia University]], [[Harvard University]], and [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] sent a letter of invitation to nine other universities to meet at Chicago in February 1900 to promote and raise standards.<ref>\"[https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/AAU%20Files/Key%20Issues/Budget%20%26%20Appropriations/FY17/Invit.pdf The Letter of Invitation to the Founding Conference of AAU]\".

''The Baltimore Sun';. March 1, 1900. p. 2.</ref>\n\nIn 1914, the AAU began [[higher education accreditation in the United States|accrediting undergraduate education]] at its member and other schools. German universities used the \"AAU Accepted List\" to determine whether a college's graduates were qualified for graduate programs. [[Regional accreditation]] agencies existed in the U.S. by the 1920s, and the AAU ended accrediting schools in 1948.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.aau.edu/association-american-universities-century-service-higher-education-1900-2000 |title=The Association of American Universities: A Century of Service to Higher Education 1900-2000 |publisher=Association of American Universities |access-date=2018-02-25}}</ref>\n\nThe AAU is made up of universities of varying sizes and missions who are committed to research. Today, 65 universities in the U.S. and Canada are members and the primary purpose of the organization is to provide a forum for the development and implementation of institutional and national policies, in order to promote strong programs in academic research and scholarship and undergraduate, graduate, and professional education.\n\n===Benefits===\nThe largest attraction of the AAU for many schools, especially nonmembers, is prestige.

One of them is \u201cVriksha\u201d or the Tree of Life. I in fact unknowingly discovered this theme. I was initially fascinated with the tree and painted many pictures with the tree juxtaposed with other elements. Gradually the tree moved to the center of the stage and started absorbing various elements and forms; just like the gigantic banyan tree which is so amorphous and protective.\n\nLater I explored the essence and nature of a man-woman relationship through contrasting forms and colors. The theme of Maithuna stands for the union between the female and the male principles \u2013 the prakriti and the purusha \u2013 that exist in nature, almost in a yin-yang fusion of being. Later on, I made a series of paintings and called it \u2013 \u201cHumanscapes\u201d, \u201cEarthscapes\u201d, and \u201cTheatre of Life.\u201d\"<ref>[http://www.knowyourstar.com/sg-vasudev-interview/ SG Vasudev \u2013 Reflecting Life with Colors and Shades]</ref>\n\n[[National Gallery of Modern Art, Bangalore]] held the retrospective exhibition of Vasudev spanning over 30 years of his works in September, 2018 which was curated by [[Sadanand Menon]]  [https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/a-retrospective-traces-the-sustained-and-spiralling-resonance-of-sg-vasudevs-works/article24841932.ece]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.vasudevart.com/images/vasudev.jpg.jpg Vasudevart]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vasudev, S.

One of them is \u201cVriksha\u201d or the Tree of Life. I in fact unknowingly discovered this theme. I was initially fascinated with the tree and painted many pictures with the tree juxtaposed with other elements. Gradually the tree moved to the center of the stage and started absorbing various elements and forms; just like the gigantic banyan tree which is so amorphous and protective.\n\nLater I explored the essence and nature of a man-woman relationship through contrasting forms and colors. The theme of Maithuna stands for the union between the female and the male principles \u2013 the prakriti and the purusha \u2013 that exist in nature, almost in a yin-yang fusion of being. Later on, I made a series of paintings and called it \u2013 \u201cHumanscapes\u201d, \u201cEarthscapes\u201d, and \u201cTheatre of Life.\u201d\"<ref>[http://www.knowyourstar.com/sg-vasudev-interview/ SG Vasudev \u2013 Reflecting Life with Colors and Shades]</ref>\n\n[[National Gallery of Modern Art, Bangalore]] held the retrospective exhibition of Vasudev spanning over 30 years of his works in September, 2018.[https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/a-retrospective-traces-the-sustained-and-spiralling-resonance-of-sg-vasudevs-works/article24841932.ece]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.vasudevart.com/images/vasudev.jpg.jpg Vasudevart]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vasudev, S.
