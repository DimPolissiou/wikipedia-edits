She supplemented her research with thousands of ethnological photographs of the individuals and groups studied, the quality of which was recognised by [[Edward Steichen]]. She experienced chronic illnesses after her return from the field, but nevertheless completed publications and many lectures but did not survive to finish a book ''The Human Career in Village India'' which was to integrate and unify her many-sided studies of human character formation in the cultural/historical context of India.<ref name=\":0\">Lesser, Alexander 1979 Obituary of Gitel Steed.

Gitel (Gertrude) Poznanski Steed</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nGertrude Poznanski was born on May 3, 1914, in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, the home of her mother, Sarah Auerbach. She was the youngest of sisters Mary and Helen, who both later emigrated to Israel. Her father was Jakob Poznanski, a businessman and Polish native who had come to the United States from Belgium. When Poznanski was still a baby, the family moved to [[The Bronx]], New York, where she was schooled at [[Wadleigh High School for Girls|Wadleigh High]]. Though not religious, she adopted the [[Yiddish]] name of Gitel. Her mother was active in the [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement]] and in leftist politics.\n\nDr. Steed began a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in banking and finance at [[New York University]], but embraced the [[Greenwich Village]] artistic and political life, often singing blues in nightclubs, and dropped out to take a job as a writer with the [[Works Progress Administration]]. [[Raphael Soyer|Rafael Soyer]] painted portrait of her at eighteen, ''Girl in a White Blouse'', (1932) which is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, and she is the medusa-haired subject in Soyer's ''Two Girls'' 1933 (oil on canvas) at the Smart Museum. In 1933 she met the painter Robert Steed (b.1903), whom she married in 1947.\n\n== Introduction to anthropology ==\nPhilosopher [[Sidney Hook]] persuaded Steed to return to NYU and in 1938 she completed her B.A. with honors in sociology and [[anthropology]], then studied as a graduate at [[Columbia University]] until 1940 as a Research Fellow in the Department of Anthropology under Professor [[Ruth Benedict]] whom she had met in 1937 and who in 1939 led Gitel Steed's first field experience among the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot Indians]] of [[Montana]].<ref>Kehoe, A.

From 1939 to 1941, Steed undertook research for [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]], the explorer and writer on Inuit life then planning a two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', on diet and subsistence; Steed worked on the South American Ona, [[Yaghan people|Yahgan]], and the [[Antillean]] Arawak and Carib, and from this formative experience began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer subsistence (not finished until 1969, well after she had established her career).<ref>Price, D. H. (2008). Anthropological intelligence: the deployment and neglect of American anthropology in the Second World War. Duke University Press.</ref>\n\nIn 1944, after the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[The Holocaust|holocaust]] against the Jews was exposed, Gitel Steed set aside her anthropology and joined the Jewish Black Book Committee, an organization of the [[World Jewish Congress]] and other Jewish anti-Fascist groups. With a few peers, she participated during 1944 and 1945 in writing ''[[The Black Book: The Nazi Crime Against the Jewish People]]'', an exhaustive indictment of calculated Nazi anti-Jewish war crimes intended for submission to the [[United Nations War Crimes Commission]]. Steed wrote \"The Strategy of Decimation\"  published in 1946 for the Jewish Black Book Committee.\n\nSteed taught at [[Hunter College]] in New York 1945 and 1947. While teaching at [[Fisk University]] in 1946/1947 she researched the [[Negro]] in the United States and in Africa and was managing editor of the University's and the American Council on Race Relations' monthly summary of \"Race Relations\" in America.<ref>Raphael, D.

She undertook life histories, community self-analysis, and projective tests, then proposed an extended field project in the Toi Shan community to understand the interdependency in social and economic relations between migrants and their kinsmen at home. [[Margaret Mead]] and others joined these Columbia [[Cross-cultural studies|comparative studies]] of contemporary cultures and they were incorporated into Mead's \"The Study of Cultures at a Distance,\"<ref>Margaret Mead and Rhoda Metraux, and published in 1953 by the University of Chicago Press</ref> \n \nSteed planned \"The Effects of Village Institutions on Personality in South China\" and had funds granted for its continuation of her Chinese research in China.<ref name=\":0\"/> However the occurrence of the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] of 1948 scuttled the project.\n\n== India ==\nSteadfastly committed to field study of institutional determinants of individual and social character, she took up the suggestion of [[psychiatrist]], Abram Kardiner, then associated with Columbia University's Department of Sociology, to pursue a similar study in India.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Mandelbaum, David Goodman, 1911\u20131987 | author2=Hockings, Paul | title=Dimensions of social life: essays in honor of David G.

She also trained in the use of a professional camera.\n\nThe research goals and procedures were ambitious; to [[Empirical research|empirically]] bring together interactions of individual, culture, community and institutions, relating real individuals, not merely statistical patterns, for functional-historical analysis of character formation at the village level<ref>Donham, B., & Roethlisberger, J. People and Projects.</ref><ref>Eames, E.. (1966). Hindu Cousin Marriages.

Bakrana was a farming economy in fertile flatlands, exclusively Hindu and with an active [[Caste|caste system]], largely untouched by the former [[British Raj|British rule]] or by land reform changes current then in India. Sujarupa hamlet was a single-caste community in the upland valleys. Adhon was controlled by pro-independence Muslims, with more occupational castes and subgroups than Bakrana, with religious minorities.\n\n== Consolidation of ethnographic research in India ==\nSteed returned to the United States in December 1951 with more than 30,000 pages of handwritten notes and some thousands of ethnological photographs, but infected with [[malaria]], and shortly after her return she also developed [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] which was particularly difficult to control and frequently put her in hospital. In addition, she suffered for over thirty years from [[Pituitary gland|pituitary cancer]]. Illness impaired her later career so that she was unable to receive her [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] until 1969, 8 years before her death. In 1963, however, Conrad Arensberg wrote \"her reputation and accomplishments are such as to make her lack of a PhD of little moment for her standing in the profession\".<ref>Arensberg, Conrad 1963 Unpublished letter on file in the Department of Anthropology and Sociology, Hofstra University, Hempstead, N.Y.</ref> Her reputation also rests on her unpublished notes; the thousands of pages of interviews, observations, projective test results, life histories, and villagers' paintings, most of which are now in the special collections of the University of Chicago Libraries.\n\nDuring the eleven years after returning from India and taking up a position at Hofstra College (now [[Hofstra University]]) in 1962 where she continued to her death in 1977, Steed had no university affiliation and promoted her work through seminars and lectures at [[Columbia University]], [[University of Chicago]], and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1953, Steed participated in a Social Science Research Council Conference on Economic Development in Brazil, India, and Japan, analyzing [[Morris Edward Opler|Dr. Morris Opler's]] \"Cultural Aspects of Economic Development in Rural India\", then later that year, 1953/4, she analyzed \"The Individual, Family, and Community in Village India\" in Columbia University's Department of Sociology graduate seminar on the psychodynamics of culture, chaired by [[Abram Kardiner]]. In 1954 Steed lectured on \"The Child, Family and Community in Rural Gujarat\" for the University of Chicago ''Seminar on Village India''. The lectures and discussions are recorded in the archive. She presented in India symposia at meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]], and the [[Social Science Research Council]].\n\nHer one publication of note during this period was a chapter \"Notes on an Approach to a Study of Personality Formation in a Hindu Village in Gujarat\",<ref>Von F\u00fcrer-Haimendorf, C..

Gitel and husband Robert Steed opened the doors of their house on West 23rd Street to visitors who included Ruth Bunzel, [[Sula Benet]], [[Vera Rubin]], [[Stanley Diamond]], [[Alexander Lesser]], [[Margaret Mead]], and Conrad Arensberg.\n\nIn 1970 Steed revisited [[Bakrana]], its population then doubled since her last visit, to observe the impact of the transforming politics in India.\n\n== Photographer ==\n[[Edward Steichen]], Director of the Department of Photography of the Museum of Modern Art, said Steed's photographs of Indian villagers, which though taken for the anthropological record and used as illustrations in varied lectures and presentations, ranked \"with first-rate human interpretations by professional photographers.\"<ref>Museum of Modern Art press release of February 19, 1953, for ''Always the Young Strangers''[https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/1683/releases/MOMA_1953_0013_13.pdf].</ref> In 1953, Steichen mounted ''Always the Young Strangers'' exhibition at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] in honour of [[Carl Sandburg|Carl Sandberg's]] 75th birthday and included Gitel Steed's photos, six of which are in the Museum's permanent photographic collection. Steichen again used her pictures in the Museum's world-touring blockbuster, [[The Family of Man]] exhibition and book. Her photographs were republished in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]], and featured in the [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch|St. Louis Post Despatch]]. While at Hofstra University, her photographic work was exhibited as part of the University's \"Focus on India\" presentation in 1962, and in 1963 Hofstra showed Steed photographs of Hindu and Muslim villagers. That same year Steed held the exhibition ''Child Life in Village India'' at the New Canaan Art Association Gallery in Connecticut and another, ''Cradle to Grave in Village India'' at the Hudson Guild Gallery in New York. In 1967 Vincent Fresno's ''Human Actions in Four Societies'' used a selection as illustrations.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nDr. Gitel Steed died in the night of September 6, 1977, evidently from a heart attack, at the age of sixty-three. She was survived by her husband and supporter for thirty years, artist Robert Steed, and by her son, Andrew.\n\nThe Gitel P. Steed papers 1907\u20131980 are archived in the University of Chicago Library and extend to approximately 13 linear metres (43 feet) of material. Most is data from her Columbia University Research in Contemporary India Field Project of 1949\u20131951 collected from three villages in western and northern India; extensive life histories of informants, psychological tests, typed notes, field notebooks, photographs, genealogies, histories, transcripts of interviews, and art work, mostly watercolours, by both researchers and child and adult villagers. These are joined by records of lectures and other publications relating to the India Project by Steed and by other scholars. Also held is data from Steed's previous fieldwork project among Chinese immigrants in New York City. The collection was given to the University of Chicago Committee on Southern Asian Studies by Robert Steed in 1978 and conveyed to the University of Chicago Library in 1984. Prior to their arrival, James Silverberg and McKim Marriott put the papers a preliminary order reflected in the collection's current organization. The collection was augmented by Robert Steed in 1985 and 1989, and by McKim Marriott and James Silverberg in 1994.

She supplemented her research with thousands of ethnological photographs of the individuals and groups studied, the quality of which was recognised by [[Edward Steichen]].

Edited by Ute Gacs, Aisha Khan, Jerrie McIntyre, Ruth Weinberg. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. Pp. 331\u2013336. Gitel (Gertrude) Poznanski Steed</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nGertrude Poznanski was born on May 3, 1914, in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, the home of her mother, Sarah Auerbach. She was the youngest of sisters Mary and Helen, who both later emigrated to Israel. Her father was Jakob Poznanski, a businessman and Polish native who had come to the United States from Belgium. When Poznanski was still a baby, the family moved to [[The Bronx]], New York, where she was schooled at [[Wadleigh High School for Girls|Wadleigh High]]. Though not religious, she adopted the [[Yiddish]] name of Gitel. Her mother was active in the [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement]] and in leftist politics.\n\nDr. Steed began a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in banking and finance at [[New York University]], but embraced the [[Greenwich Village]] artistic and political life, often singing blues in nightclubs, and dropped out to take a job as a writer with the [[Works Progress Administration]]. [[Raphael Soyer|Rafael Soyer]] painted portrait of her at eighteen, ''Girl in a White Blouse'', (1932) which is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, and she is the medusa-haired subject in Soyer's ''Two Girls'' 1933 (oil on canvas) at the Smart Museum. In 1933 she met the painter Robert Steed (b.1903), whom she married in 1947.\n\n== Introduction to anthropology ==\nPhilosopher [[Sidney Hook]] persuaded Steed to return to NYU and in 1938 she completed her B.A. with honors in sociology and [[anthropology]], then studied as a graduate at [[Columbia University]] until 1940 as a Research Fellow in the Department of Anthropology under Professor [[Ruth Benedict]] whom she had met in 1937 and who in 1939 led Gitel Steed's first field experience among the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot Indians]] of [[Montana]].<ref>Kehoe, A.

From 1939 to 1941, Steed undertook research for [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]], the explorer and writer on Inuit life then planning a two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', on diet and subsistence; Steed worked on the South American Ona, [[Yaghan people|Yahgan]], and the [[Antillean]] Arawak and Carib, and from this formative experience began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer subsistence (not finished until 1969, well after she had established her career).<ref>Price, D. H. (2008). Anthropological intelligence: the deployment and neglect of American anthropology in the Second World War. Duke University Press.</ref>\n\nIn 1944, after the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[The Holocaust|holocaust]] against the Jews was exposed, Gitel Steed set aside her anthropology and joined the Jewish Black Book Committee, an organization of the [[World Jewish Congress]] and other Jewish anti-Fascist groups. With a few peers, she participated during 1944 and 1945 in writing ''[[The Black Book: The Nazi Crime Against the Jewish People]]'', an exhaustive indictment of calculated Nazi anti-Jewish war crimes intended for submission to the [[United Nations War Crimes Commission]]. Steed wrote \"The Strategy of Decimation\"  published in 1946 for the Jewish Black Book Committee.\n\nSteed taught at [[Hunter College]] in New York 1945 and 1947. While teaching at [[Fisk University]] in 1946/1947 she researched the [[Negro]] in the United States and in Africa and was managing editor of the University's and the American Council on Race Relations' monthly summary of \"Race Relations\" in America.<ref>Raphael, D.

She undertook life histories, community self-analysis, and projective tests, then proposed an extended field project in the Toi Shan community to understand the interdependency in social and economic relations between migrants and their kinsmen at home. [[Margaret Mead]] and others joined these Columbia [[Cross-cultural studies|comparative studies]] of contemporary cultures and they were incorporated into Mead's \"The Study of Cultures at a Distance,\"<ref>Margaret Mead and Rhoda Metraux, and published in 1953 by the University of Chicago Press</ref> \n \nSteed planned \"The Effects of Village Institutions on Personality in South China\" and had funds granted for its continuation of her Chinese research in China.<ref name=\":0\"/> However the occurrence of the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] of 1948 scuttled the project.\n\n== India ==\nSteadfastly committed to field study of institutional determinants of individual and social character, she took up the suggestion of [[psychiatrist]], Abram Kardiner, then associated with Columbia University's Department of Sociology, to pursue a similar study in India.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Mandelbaum, David Goodman, 1911\u20131987 | author2=Hockings, Paul | title=Dimensions of social life: essays in honor of David G.

She also trained in the use of a professional camera.\n\nThe research goals and procedures were ambitious; to [[Empirical research|empirically]] bring together interactions of individual, culture, community and institutions, relating real individuals, not merely statistical patterns, for functional-historical analysis of character formation at the village level<ref>Donham, B., & Roethlisberger, J. People and Projects.</ref><ref>Eames, E.. (1966). Hindu Cousin Marriages. American Anthropologist, 68(3), 757\u2013758.</ref> in the three settlements chosen: [[Bakrana]], a [[Hindu]] village in [[Gujarat]]; Sujarupa, a Hindu hamlet in [[Rajputana]]; and Adhon, a predominantly [[Muslim]] village in the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]]. Bakrana was a farming economy in fertile flatlands, exclusively Hindu and with an active [[Caste|caste system]], largely untouched by the former [[British Raj|British rule]] or by land reform changes current then in India. Sujarupa hamlet was a single-caste community in the upland valleys. Adhon was controlled by pro-independence Muslims, with more occupational castes and subgroups than Bakrana, with religious minorities.\n\n== Consolidation of ethnographic research in India ==\nSteed returned to the United States in December 1951 with more than 30,000 pages of handwritten notes and some thousands of ethnological photographs, but infected with [[malaria]], and shortly after her return she also developed [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] which was particularly difficult to control and frequently put her in hospital. In addition, she suffered for over thirty years from [[Pituitary gland|pituitary cancer]]. Illness impaired her later career so that she was unable to receive her [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] until 1969, 8 years before her death. In 1963, however, Conrad Arensberg wrote \"her reputation and accomplishments are such as to make her lack of a PhD of little moment for her standing in the profession\".<ref>Arensberg, Conrad 1963 Unpublished letter on file in the Department of Anthropology and Sociology, Hofstra University, Hempstead, N.Y.</ref> Her reputation also rests on her unpublished notes; the thousands of pages of interviews, observations, projective test results, life histories, and villagers' paintings, most of which are now in the special collections of the University of Chicago Libraries.\n\nDuring the eleven years after returning from India and taking up a position at Hofstra College (now [[Hofstra University]]) in 1962 where she continued to her death in 1977, Steed had no university affiliation and promoted her work through seminars and lectures at [[Columbia University]], [[University of Chicago]], and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1953, Steed participated in a Social Science Research Council Conference on Economic Development in Brazil, India, and Japan, analyzing [[Morris Edward Opler|Dr. Morris Opler's]] \"Cultural Aspects of Economic Development in Rural India\", then later that year, 1953/4, she analyzed \"The Individual, Family, and Community in Village India\" in Columbia University's Department of Sociology graduate seminar on the psychodynamics of culture, chaired by [[Abram Kardiner]]. In 1954 Steed lectured on \"The Child, Family and Community in Rural Gujarat\" for the University of Chicago ''Seminar on Village India''. The lectures and discussions are recorded in the archive. She presented in India symposia at meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]], and the [[Social Science Research Council]].\n\nHer one publication of note during this period was a chapter \"Notes on an Approach to a Study of Personality Formation in a Hindu Village in Gujarat\",<ref>Von F\u00fcrer-Haimendorf, C..

Gitel and husband Robert Steed opened the doors of their house on West 23rd Street to visitors who included Ruth Bunzel, [[Sula Benet]], [[Vera Rubin]], [[Stanley Diamond]], [[Alexander Lesser]], [[Margaret Mead]], and Conrad Arensberg.\n\nIn 1970 Steed revisited [[Bakrana]], its population then doubled since her last visit, to observe the impact of the transforming politics in India.\n\n== Photographer ==\n[[Edward Steichen]], Director of the Department of Photography of the Museum of Modern Art, said Steed's photographs of Indian villagers, which though taken for the anthropological record and used as illustrations in varied lectures and presentations, ranked \"with first-rate human interpretations by professional photographers.\"<ref>Museum of Modern Art press release of February 19, 1953, for ''Always the Young Strangers''[https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/1683/releases/MOMA_1953_0013_13.pdf].</ref> In 1953, Steichen mounted ''Always the Young Strangers'' exhibition at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] in honour of [[Carl Sandburg|Carl Sandberg's]] 75th birthday and included Gitel Steed's photos, six of which are in the Museum's permanent photographic collection. Steichen again used her pictures in the Museum's world-touring blockbuster, [[The Family of Man]] exhibition and book. Her photographs were republished in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]], and featured in the [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch|St. Louis Post Despatch]]. While at Hofstra University, her photographic work was exhibited as part of the University's \"Focus on India\" presentation in 1962, and in 1963 Hofstra showed Steed photographs of Hindu and Muslim villagers. That same year Steed held the exhibition ''Child Life in Village India'' at the New Canaan Art Association Gallery in Connecticut and another, ''Cradle to Grave in Village India'' at the Hudson Guild Gallery in New York. In 1967 Vincent Fresno's ''Human Actions in Four Societies'' used a selection as illustrations.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nDr. Gitel Steed died in the night of September 6, 1977, evidently from a heart attack, at the age of sixty-three. She was survived by her husband and supporter for thirty years, artist Robert Steed, and by her son, Andrew.\n\nThe Gitel P. Steed papers 1907\u20131980 are archived in the University of Chicago Library and extend to approximately 13 linear metres (43 feet) of material. Most is data from her Columbia University Research in Contemporary India Field Project of 1949\u20131951 collected from three villages in western and northern India; extensive life histories of informants, psychological tests, typed notes, field notebooks, photographs, genealogies, histories, transcripts of interviews, and art work, mostly watercolours, by both researchers and child and adult villagers. These are joined by records of lectures and other publications relating to the India Project by Steed and by other scholars. Also held is data from Steed's previous fieldwork project among Chinese immigrants in New York City. The collection was given to the University of Chicago Committee on Southern Asian Studies by Robert Steed in 1978 and conveyed to the University of Chicago Library in 1984. Prior to their arrival, James Silverberg and McKim Marriott put the papers a preliminary order reflected in the collection's current organization. The collection was augmented by Robert Steed in 1985 and 1989, and by McKim Marriott and James Silverberg in 1994.

Domestic production, which had already been damaged by government policies, was unable to replace the necessary imported goods.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/16/world/americas/venezuela-shortages.html|title=How Food in Venezuela Went From Subsidized to Scarce|last=Benzaquen|first=Mercy|date=16 July 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=18 July 2017|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716152743/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/16/world/americas/venezuela-shortages.html|archive-date=16 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAccording to economist \u00c1ngel Alay\u00f3n, the availability of food throughout Venezuela is directly controlled and distributed by the government, even that through private companies.<ref name=\"PDescasez\" /> Alay\u00f3n states the problem is not distribution, however, but production; he claims that nothing is being produced so over-regulation of distributors is irrelevant.<ref name=\"PDescasez\" /> Expropriations by the government resulted in a drop in production in Venezuela.<ref name=\"PDescasez\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuela-confronts-retail-sector-1423528705|title=Venezuela Confronts Retail Sector|date=9 February 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|last2=Schaefer Mu\u00f1oz|first2=Sara|last1=Minaya|first1=Ezequiel|accessdate=1 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303075001/http://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuela-confronts-retail-sector-1423528705|archive-date=3 March 2015|url-status=live}}<br />* {{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21640395-government-offers-no-solutions-mounting-economic-crisis-empty-shelves-and-rhetoric|title=Empty shelves and rhetoric|date=24 January 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=1 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228092943/http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21640395-government-offers-no-solutions-mounting-economic-crisis-empty-shelves-and-rhetoric|archive-date=28 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Miguel Angel Santos, a researcher at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]], the industry of goods production in Venezuela was destroyed as a result of expropriations of private means of production since 2004, while a growth in import consumerism occurred when Venezuela had abundant oil money.<ref name=\"INFOmarch\">{{cite news|url=http://www.infobae.com/2015/03/22/1717185-politicas-que-llevan-un-pais-la-escasez-lugar-la-abundancia|title=Pol\u00edticas que llevan a un pa\u00eds a la escasez en lugar de la abundancia|date=22 March 2015|agency=[[Infobae]]|last1=Mizrahi|first1=Dar\u00edo|accessdate=23 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324161555/http://www.infobae.com/2015/03/22/1717185-politicas-que-llevan-un-pais-la-escasez-lugar-la-abundancia|archive-date=24 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The drop of oil prices beginning in 2014 made it impossible for the government to import necessary goods for Venezuelans, though by this point the country was largely reliant on imports.<ref name=\"APdec2016\" />\n\n====Currency and price controls====\n[[File:Venezuela inflation on the black market (DolarToday) on a logarithmic scale.png|upright=1.5|thumb|The value of one US dollar in Venezuelan bol\u00edvares (VEF) on the black market through time, according to DolarToday.com.

The military is in charge of food management now, and they're not going to just take that on without getting their cut.|source=Ret. General Cliver Alcala<ref name=\"APdec2016\"/> }}\nAn [[Associated Press]] investigation published in December 2016 found that the military was involved in schemes to benefit from food scarcity rather than help assuage it. Military sellers would drastically increase the cost of goods and create shortages by hoarding products. Ships containing imports would often be held at bay until military officials at Venezuela's ports were paid off. Officials bypassed standard practices, such as performing health inspections, pocketing money normally spent on such certificates. One anonymous businessman who participated in the lucrative food dealings with Venezuelan military officials, and had contracts valued at $131&nbsp;million between 2012 and 2015, showed the Associated Press his accounts for his business in Venezuela. The government would contract him for more than double the actual cost for products. For example, one corn contract of $52&nbsp;million would be $20&nbsp;million more than the market average. Then the businessman would have to use the extra money to pay military personnel to import such products. The businessman said he had been paying millions of dollars to military officials for years, and that the food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres, once had to be paid $8&nbsp;million just to import goods into Venezuela.<ref name=\"APdec2016\"/> Documents seen by the Associated Press showing prices for corn also revealed that the government budgeted $118&nbsp;million in July 2016, an overpayment of $50&nbsp;million over average market prices for that month.<ref name=\"APdec2016\"/>\n\nAccording to retired general Antonio Rivero, Maduro allowed the military to control their schemes, which made them less rebellious by giving them the resources to feed their families, among other benefits. The military has also used currency control licenses to obtain dollars at a lower exchange rate than the average Venezuelan. The military shared the licenses with friendly businessmen to import very few goods with the cheaper dollars while pocketing the remaining dollars. Documents show that General Rodolfo Marco Torres had given contracts to potential [[shell companies]]. Two companies, the Panamanian located Atlas Systems and J.A. Comercio de Generous Alimenticios diverted $5.5&nbsp;million to Swiss accounts of two brothers-in-law of then-food minister, General Carlos Osorio in 2012 and 2013.<ref name=\"APdec2016\"/>\n\nIn late January 2017, members of the [[United States Congress]] responded to the Associated Press investigation, suggested making targeted sanctions against corrupt Venezuelan officials who had taken advantage of the food shortages and participated in graft. Democratic Senator of Maryland and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee [[Ben Cardin]] stated, \"When the military is profiting off of food distribution while the Venezuelan people increasingly starve, corruption has reached a new level of depravity that cannot go unnoticed.\" Senator [[Marco Rubio]] said that, \"This should be one of [[Donald Trump|President Trump]]'s first actions in office.\"<ref name=\"NBCjan2017\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/us-lawmakers-call-action-venezuela-food-corruption-n710906|title=US Lawmakers Call for Action on Venezuela Food Corruption|date=23 January 2017|publisher=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=26 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126032853/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/us-lawmakers-call-action-venezuela-food-corruption-n710906|archive-date=26 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Medical care used for political gain====\nAccording to an article in ''The New York Times'', medical care has been withheld for political gain.

The military is in charge of food management now, and they're not going to just take that on without getting their cut.|source=Ret. General Cliver Alcala<ref name=\"APdec2016\"/> }}\nAn [[Associated Press]] investigation published in December 2016 found that the military was involved in schemes to benefit from food scarcity rather than help assuage it. Military sellers would drastically increase the cost of goods and create shortages by hoarding products. Ships containing imports would often be held at bay until military officials at Venezuela's ports were paid off. Officials bypassed standard practices, such as performing health inspections, pocketing money normally spent on such certificates. One anonymous businessman who participated in the lucrative food dealings with Venezuelan military officials, and had contracts valued at $131&nbsp;million between 2012 and 2015, showed the Associated Press his accounts for his business in Venezuela. The government would contract him for more than double the actual cost for products. For example, one corn contract of $52&nbsp;million would be $20&nbsp;million more than the market average. Then the businessman would have to use the extra money to pay military personnel to import such products. The businessman said he had been paying millions of dollars to military officials for years, and that the food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres, once had to be paid $8&nbsp;million just to import goods into Venezuela.<ref name=\"APdec2016\"/> Documents seen by the Associated Press showing prices for corn also revealed that the government budgeted $118&nbsp;million in July 2016, an overpayment of $50&nbsp;million over average market prices for that month.<ref name=\"APdec2016\"/>\n\nAccording to retired general Antonio Rivero, Maduro allowed the military to control their schemes, which made them less rebellious by giving them the resources to feed their families, among other benefits. The military has also used currency control licenses to obtain dollars at a lower exchange rate than the average Venezuelan. The military shared the licenses with friendly businessmen to import very few goods with the cheaper dollars while pocketing the remaining dollars.
