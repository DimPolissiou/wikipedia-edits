The recent premiere of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|Third Symphony]] had been nothing short of disastrous, receiving an extremely negative, though not surprising review from [[Eduard Hanslick]], given Hanslick's predilection for the works of Brahms.<ref name=\"harr32\">Harrandt (2004), p.&nbsp;32</ref>\n<blockquote>\n...his artistic intentions are honest, however oddly he employs them. Instead of a critique, therefore, we would rather simply confess that we have not understood his gigantic symphony. Neither were his poetic intentions clear to us...nor could we grasp the purely musical coherence. The composer...was greeted with cheering and was consoled with lively applause at the close by a fraction of the audience that stayed to the end...the Finale, which exceeded all its predecessors in oddities, was only experienced to the last extreme by a little host of hardy adventurers.<ref name=\"harr32\" />\n</blockquote>\nThe composition of his [[Symphony No. 4 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 4]] marked the beginning of what some refer to as the \"Major Tetralogy\", Bruckner's four symphonies composed in [[major key]]s.<ref>Engel (1955), p.&nbsp;25</ref> In fact, this tetralogy was part of an entire decade in Bruckner's compositional history devoted to large-scale works written in major keys, a fact of note considering that all of his previous symphonies and foremost choral works were composed in minor keys.<ref>Watson (1996), p.&nbsp;97</ref> The composition of his [[String Quintet (Bruckner)|String Quintet]] and the Sixth Symphony marked the beginning of a new compositional period for Bruckner within the realm of the \"Major Tetralogy\".<ref>Hawkshaw http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com:80/subscriber/article/grove/music/40030</ref> However, the Sixth Symphony has extensive ties to the Fourth and [[Symphony No. 5 (Bruckner)|Fifth]] Symphonies and is considered to have been composed as a reflective, humanistic response to its two direct symphonic predecessors. It has even been dubbed the ''Philosophical'' symphony by critics for this reason.<ref name=\"eng44\">Engel (1955), p.&nbsp;44</ref>\n\n==Compositional hallmarks==\nBruckner's symphonies encompass many techniques but the one unwavering hallmark of his symphonic compositions is a singular formal pattern that underwent very little variation over the course of his symphonic repertory. In fact, their four extended movements are indebted to the structure and thematic treatment in the late works of [[Beethoven]].<ref name=\"red51\">Redlich (1963), pp.&nbsp;51\u201352</ref> The only large-scale diversion from this formal scheme in the Sixth Symphony is Bruckner's use of [[sonata form]] in the second movement instead of his usual large-scale [[ternary form]].<ref>Wolff (1942), p.&nbsp;168</ref>\n\nThematically speaking, there are two distinct varieties of themes in Bruckner's symphonies. First, there are [[theme (music)|themes]] that are clearly defined in shape and then there are the themes that operate more as [[motif (music)|motives]] with a shorter length and a more open-ended shape, as is typical of the Sixth Symphony.<ref>Wolff (1942), p.&nbsp;166</ref> Another characteristic thematic feature of Bruckner's symphonies is the intimate relationship between the outer two movements, though there is typically more of an emphasis on thematic contrast within the first movement.<ref name=\"red51\" /> Specifically, the amplification of the [[exposition (music)|exposition]] of the first movement consists of two subsidiary themes as well as the primary theme, which are subsequently developed, a technique that is considered uniquely Brucknerian.<ref>Wolff (1942), pp.&nbsp;163, 166</ref>\n\nOther characteristics that are found in Bruckner's symphonies (especially the Sixth) include the extensive treatment of the [[dominant seventh chord]] as a [[German sixth chord]] in a new key, usage of [[cadence (music)|cadences]] as a decisive factor in daring modulations, the treatment of organ points as pivotal to the [[harmony]] and structure, chains of harmonic sequences, and, most notably, extensive use of [[rhythmic]] motives, especially the characteristic [[Bruckner rhythm]], a rhythm consisting of two fourths and three quarter notes, or vice versa.<ref>Wolff (1942), pp.&nbsp;173\u2013174</ref> This rhythm dominated most of the Fourth Symphony and was practically nonexistent in the Fifth Symphony, but becomes nothing short of a driving force in the Sixth Symphony; the metric complexities generated by this unique rhythmic grouping are more pronounced in the first movement of the Sixth Symphony than in any of Bruckner's other compositions.<ref name=\"wat105\">Watson (1996), p.&nbsp;105</ref>\n\n==Orchestration==\nThe [[orchestration]] of the Sixth Symphony complies with Bruckner's customary, albeit peculiar, techniques. Just as in his other symphonic works, there are no marks of extreme virtuosity apparent in the score and the lines are straightforward.<ref>Wolff (1942), p.&nbsp;172</ref> The Sixth Symphony is scored for 2 [[flutes]], 2 [[oboes]], 2 [[clarinets]], 2 [[bassoons]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombones]], [[tuba|bass tuba]], [[timpani]], and [[string section]]. Bruckner commonly alternates between solo and [[tutti]] sections, as well as layering instruments to provide texture and show different subject groups.<ref>Horton \"Bruckner and the Symphony Orchestra\" (2004), p.&nbsp;138</ref>\n\n==Forms, themes, and analysis==\nThe symphony has four movements:\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman\n|Majestoso ([[A major]])\n|Adagio: Sehr feierlich ([[F major]])\n|Scherzo: Nicht schnell \u2014 Trio: Langsam ([[A minor]])\n|Finale: Bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell (A minor \u2192 A major)\n}}\n\n===I. ''Majestoso''===\nBruckner labels this movement \"Majestoso\", not the conventional \"Maestoso\", probably from his Latin (from \"Maiestas\" \u2013 sovereign power). The movement, in obvious [[sonata form]], opens with the characteristic 'Bruckner rhythm' played in the violins, though Bruckner is careful to maintain the enigmatic atmosphere by indicating a bowing that keeps the bow on the string and therefore prohibits the rhythmic figure from becoming too lively.<ref name=\"simp152\">Simpson (1967), p.&nbsp;152</ref> One then hears the quietly intense main theme, a paraphrase of the main theme of Bruckner's own [[Symphony No. 4 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 4]], stated in the low strings and juxtaposed against the pulsating rhythm in the violins:<ref>Engel (1955), p.&nbsp;45\u201346</ref>\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative cis'' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\major \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Majestoso\" 2 = 54\n  <cis cis'>8 \\pp ( \\downbow r16 <cis\n  cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\downbow \\once \\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 \\upbow <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 \\upbow\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  | % 2\n  <cis cis'>8 ( -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  | % 3\n  <cis cis'>8 ( -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  | % 4\n  <cis cis'>8 ( -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  | % 5\n  <cis cis'>8 ( -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  | % 6\n  <cis cis'>8 ( -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  }\n\\new Staff \\relative e, { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\major \\clef bass \\time 2/2\nR1 | % 2\n  r2 r4 r8 r16 <e e'>16 \\p ^\\markup{ {breit gezogen} } | % 3\n  <e e'>2 <a, a'>2 | % 4\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    r4 <g g'>4 \\< \\upbow <a a'>4\n  }\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <bes bes'>4 <a a'>4 <g g'>4\n  }\n  | % 5\n  <a a'>2. \\! \\> <f' f'>4 | % 6\n  <e e'>2 \\! r2 }\n>> }\n</score>\n\nThe key is [[A major]] when the first theme enters; however, the mystery is heightened by notes outside the realm of A major tonality that appear in the melodic line, namely the pitches G, B{{flat}} and F, [[Neapolitan chord|Neapolitan]] inflections that will have large-scale tonal effects that come to fruition later in the symphony.

One of the most fascinating features of the harmonic structure is Bruckner's avoidance of a [[root (chord)|root position]] tonic chord for much of the movement.<ref name=\"wat107\">Watson (1996), pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107</ref> The first twenty bars of the movement once again rest on a dominant pedal and when the bass finally moves to the tonic pitch (A), it is not a root position tonic chord; instead, it acts as the bottom of a [[first inversion]] chord of F major (bar 21).<ref name=\"simp160\" />\n\nIn the development, one sees the addition of a new [[motif (music)|motif]] and harmonically, the section centers around [[D-flat major|D{{flat}} major]], [[G-flat major|G{{flat}} major]], and B{{flat}} minor, all closely related keys but ones that are isolated from the tonic (A minor). The dominant of A minor is reached (bar 75) and here, the recapitulation begins, once again over a dominant pedal. It is important to note that there has still not been a root chord of A minor. This elusive A minor root chord finally appears at the end of the recapitulation leading into the [[C major]] [[ternary form|Trio]] section.<ref>Simpson (1967), p.&nbsp;161</ref>\n\nThe slow trio is in the style of a [[L\u00e4ndler]], an Austrian folk dance and, according to Williamson, confirms that in Bruckner's works, it [the trio] is a place for construction in [[timbre|tone color]] as in the moment when horn and [[pizzicato]] strings compete on the same rhythmic figure:<ref>Williamson (2004), p.&nbsp;90</ref>\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative as { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"pizzicato strings\" \\key c \\major \\clef treble \\time 2/4 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Langsam\" 4 = 52\n  r8. ^\"pizz.\" \\p <as es' fis>16 <fis' as\n  es'>16. <as, es' fis>32 <as es' fis>16. <as' es' fis>32 | % 2\n  <as es' fis>8 r16 <es fis as>16 <fis as es'>16. <es fis as>32 <fis\n  as es'>16. <es' fis as>32 | % 3\n  <fis as es'>8 r8 r4 }\n\\new Staff \\relative c { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"pizzicato strings\" \\key c \\major \\clef bass \\time 2/4\nc8 ^\"pizz.\" -. r8 r4 | % 2\n  r8 c8 r4 | % 3\n  c8 r8 r4 }\n>> }\n</score>\nIn fact, this dialogue between pizzicato strings, horn and woodwinds is central to the texture of the whole Trio section. Although the key is C major, there are moments of harmonic ambiguity, as in the preceding movements. At one point (bar 5), the strings point towards D{{flat}} major while the woodwinds attempt to assert A{{flat}} major by quoting the inversion of the main theme of [[Symphony No. 5 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 5]] that is in A{{flat}} major.<ref name=\"wat107\" /> The scherzo returns in its entirety at the end of the trio, adhering to a typical large-scale ternary structure.\n\n===IV. ''Finale: Bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell'' (With motion, but not too fast)===\nWatson characterized the Finale as a steady, organic assertion of A major against its Neapolitan relatives. However, this sonata form movement begins with a theme in [[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]] A minor that once again stresses Neapolitan relationships with the obvious presence of the flat sixth (the pitch being F{{music|natural}}):<ref>Watson (1996), p.&nbsp;107</ref>\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative f' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"paino\" \\key a \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell\" 4 = 120\n  R1*2\\p | % 3\n  r4 <f f'>2 (\n  \\upbow <e e'>8 <d d'>8 ) | % 4\n  <e e'>2 \\< <d d'>8 ( <c c'>8 <b b'>8 <a a'>8 ) | % 5\n  a'4 \\!

(The Fifth, Sixth and Seventh represent Bruckner's period of confidence as a composer and, along with the unfinished Ninth, are as a group the symphonies he did not extensively revise.<ref name=\"simp150\" />) The Sixth was first published in 1899, a task overseen by former Bruckner pupil Cyrill Hynais. This edition did encompass a few minute changes from Bruckner's original, including the repetition of the second half of the Trio in the third movement. The next edition appeared only in 1935, from [[Robert Haas (musicologist)|Robert Haas]] under ''Internationale Bruckner-Gesellschaft'' auspices. In 1952 [[Leopold Nowak]], who took over Haas's job, published an edition that was a replicate of Bruckner's 1881 original score. In 1986 the ''IBG'' issued an \u201caudit\u201d of the efforts of Hynais, Haas and Nowak, and in 1997 it republished the Nowak.\n\nThe version of the Sixth performed under the direction of Mahler for the 1899 premiere was never published;<ref name=\"simp124\" /> Mahler had made substantial changes to the whole score before that performance, of course unsanctioned by the deceased Bruckner.<ref>Barford (1978), p.&nbsp;50</ref> There exists also an inauthentic edition by Schalk.\n\n==Critical and cultural reception==\nCriticism of Bruckner's Symphony No. 6 is similar to the critical response that his preceding symphonies had received. Whereas Bruckner considered his Sixth Symphony to be his \"boldest symphony,\" it was not generally held in high regard.<ref>Simpson (1967), p.&nbsp;136</ref> In terms of interpretation, the Sixth Symphony has also been the unluckiest, with the vast majority of conductors ignoring Bruckner's specific tempo markings and throwing off the carefully planned balance of the movements.<ref>Simpson (1967), p.&nbsp;168</ref> One 2004 reviewer for ''[[The Musical Times]]'' referred to the inner movements of this symphony as \"flawed but attractive enough\" and dubbed the outer movements \"burdensome.\"<ref name=\"hort5\">Horton ''Bruckner's Symphonies'' (2004), p.&nbsp;5</ref>\n\nHanslick, as usual, was without a doubt the harshest critic of them all. He was once quoted as saying, \"whom I wish to destroy shall be destroyed,\" and Bruckner seems to have been a prime target.<ref name=\"harr32\" /> After hearing the 1883 performance of the middle movements of the Sixth Symphony, Hanslick wrote:\n<blockquote>\nIt has become ever harder for me personally to achieve a proper relationship with these peculiar compositions in which clever, original, and even inspired moments alternate frequently without recognizable connection with barely understandable platitudes, empty and dull patches, stretched out over such unsparing length as to threaten to run players as well as listeners out of breath.<ref name=\"harr32\" />\n</blockquote>\nHere, Hanslick touched on the most common complaint about Bruckner's symphonic writing: the seemingly endless journey to a conclusion of musical thought. [[Dyneley Hussey]] critiqued the Sixth Symphony in a 1957 review for ''The Musical Times'' and reached the same conclusions half a century later, writing: <blockquote>\nHis most tiresome habit is his way of pulling up dead at frequent intervals, and then starting the argument all over again...One has the impression...that we are traversing a town with innumerable traffic lights, all of which turn red as we approach them.<ref name=\"hort5\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nHarsh critical reception of the Sixth Symphony, as well as his entire body of work, can also be attributed to critical reception of Bruckner as a person. He was a devout Catholic whose religious fervor often had a negative effect on those he encountered. One of his pupils, [[Franz Schalk]], commented that it was the age of moral and spiritual liberalism...but also in which he [Bruckner] intruded...with his medieval, monasterial concept of humankind and life.<ref>Floros (2001), p.&nbsp;289</ref>\n\nRegardless of the criticisms, both musical and personal, there were some who attempted to find the beauty in Bruckner's Sixth Symphony. [[Donald Tovey]] wrote, \"...if one clears their mind, not only of prejudice but of wrong points of view, and treats Bruckner's Sixth Symphony as a kind of music we have never heard before, there is no doubt that its high quality will strike us at every moment\".<ref>Simpson (1967), p.&nbsp;123</ref> Still others marvel over the rarity of performances of the Sixth Symphony, citing its bright character and key and its plethora of tender, memorable themes as grounds for more widespread acceptance.<ref name=\"wat105\" />\n\nCarl Hruby wrote that Bruckner once said that if he were to speak to Beethoven about bad critiques Beethoven would say, \"My dear Bruckner, don't bother yourself about it. It was no better for me, and the same gentlemen who use me as a stick to beat you with still don't understand my last quartets, however much they may pretend to.\"<ref>Jackson (2001), p.&nbsp;207</ref> In saying this, Bruckner both acknowledged his bad critiques and maintained hope that his own compositions might one day garner the same type of positive reaction that Beethoven's music received from his contemporaries.\n\n==Performance and recording history==\n[[File:Bruckner6recording.jpg|thumb|right|200x200 pixels|Cover of the [[Otto Klemperer|Klemperer]]/[[Philharmonia Orchestra|New Philharmonia]] 1964 recording, reissued 2003]]\nThe first performance of Bruckner's Symphony No. 6 was by the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] conducted by [[Wilhelm Jahn]] on February 11, 1883, making it the only performance of the piece that Bruckner heard in his lifetime. However, only the two middle movements were performed. The first complete performance of the Sixth Symphony occurred in 1899 conducted by Gustav Mahler who made substantial changes to the score. The first full performance of the original score took place in [[Stuttgart]] in 1901, conducted by [[Karl Pohlig]].<ref name=\"simp124\" /> Since that first full performance, the Sixth Symphony has become part of the symphonic repertory, but is the least performed of Bruckner's symphonies, never overcoming its original status as a symphonic \"stepchild\".<ref>Korstvedt (2001), p.&nbsp;185</ref>\n\nThe oldest surviving recorded performance is of [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] conducting the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in 1943; however, the first movement is missing. The oldest surviving ''complete'' recorded performance is of [[Georg Ludwig Jochum]] with the [[Bruckner Orchestra Linz]] from 1944. The first commercial recording is from 1950 and features [[Henry Swoboda]] and the [[Vienna Symphony Orchestra]].\n\n==Selected discography==\n* Otto Klemperer and New Philharmonia Orchestra \u00a92003 EMI Records Ltd (recorded November 1964)\n* Eugen Jochum and Symphonie-Orchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks \u00a91966 Deutsche Grammophon\n* [[William Steinberg]] and [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] \u00a91972 RCA\n* Horst Stein and Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra \u00a91974 Decca\n* Daniel Barenboim and Chicago Symphony Orchestra \u00a91977 Deutsche Grammophon\n* Herbert von Karajan and [[Berliner Philharmoniker]] \u00a91979 Deutsche Grammophon\n* Sir Georg Solti and Chicago Symphony Orchestra \u00a91979 Decca\n* Wolfgang Sawallisch and Bayerisches Staatsorchester \u00a91982 Orfeo\n* Ferdinand Leitner and SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und Freiburg \u00a91982 H\u00e4nssler Classic\n* Riccardo Muti and Berliner Philharmoniker \u00a91988 EMI\n* Eliahu Inbal and Radio-Sinfonie-Orchester Frankfurt \u00a91989 Teldec\n* Herbert Blomstedt and San Francisco Symphony Orchestra \u00a91990 London\n* Jesus Lopez-Cobos and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra \u00a91991 Telarc\n* Bernard Haitink and [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] \u00a91994 Universal International Music B.V.\n* Christoph von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra \u00a91994 London\n* Gunter Wand and NDR-Sinfonieorchester \u00a91996 RCA Victor\n* Eugen Jochum and Staatskapelle Dresden \u00a91998 EMI Records Ltd.\n* Sergiu Celibidache and M\u00fcnchner Philharmoniker \u00a91999 EMI Records, Ltd.\n* Riccardo Chailly and [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] \u00a91999 Decca\n* Christoph Eschenbach and Houston Symphony Orchestra \u00a92000 Koch Int.\n* Eugen Jochum and Staatskapelle Dresden \u00a92000 EMI Records Ltd.\n* Sir Colin Davis and London Symphony Orchestra \u00a92002 London Symphony Orchestra Ltd.\n* Michael Gielen and SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und Freiburg \u00a92002 H\u00e4nssler Classic\n* Eugen Jochum and [[Berliner Philharmoniker]] \u00a92002 Deutsche Grammophon\n* Kurt Masur and Gewandhausorchester Leipzig \u00a92004 BMG Music\n* \"[[Alberto Lizzio]]\" and \"South German Philharmonic Orchestra\" \u00a92005 Point Classics.<small>Note: No such performers exist. \"Alberto Lizzio\" was a pseudonym invented by bargain-record producer [[Alfred Scholz]] and attached to older performances (often conducted by [[Hans Swarowsky]], [[Milan Horvat]], [[Carl Melles]] or himself).

The recent premiere of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|Third Symphony]] had been nothing short of disastrous, receiving an extremely negative, though not surprising review from [[Eduard Hanslick]], given Hanslick's predilection for the works of Brahms.<ref name=\"harr32\">Harrandt (2004), p.&nbsp;32</ref>\n<blockquote>\n...his artistic intentions are honest, however oddly he employs them. Instead of a critique, therefore, we would rather simply confess that we have not understood his gigantic symphony. Neither were his poetic intentions clear to us...nor could we grasp the purely musical coherence. The composer...was greeted with cheering and was consoled with lively applause at the close by a fraction of the audience that stayed to the end...the Finale, which exceeded all its predecessors in oddities, was only experienced to the last extreme by a little host of hardy adventurers.<ref name=\"harr32\" />\n</blockquote>\nThe composition of his [[Symphony No. 4 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 4]] marked the beginning of what some refer to as the \"Major Tetralogy\", Bruckner's four symphonies composed in [[major key]]s.<ref>Engel (1955), p.&nbsp;25</ref> In fact, this tetralogy was part of an entire decade in Bruckner's compositional history devoted to large-scale works written in major keys, a fact of note considering that all of his previous symphonies and foremost choral works were composed in minor keys.<ref>Watson (1996), p.&nbsp;97</ref> The composition of his [[String Quintet (Bruckner)|String Quintet]] and the Sixth Symphony marked the beginning of a new compositional period for Bruckner within the realm of the \"Major Tetralogy\".<ref>Hawkshaw http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com:80/subscriber/article/grove/music/40030</ref> However, the Sixth Symphony has extensive ties to the Fourth and [[Symphony No. 5 (Bruckner)|Fifth]] Symphonies and is considered to have been composed as a reflective, humanistic response to its two direct symphonic predecessors. It has even been dubbed the ''Philosophical'' symphony by critics for this reason.<ref name=\"eng44\">Engel (1955), p.&nbsp;44</ref>\n\n==Compositional hallmarks==\nBruckner's symphonies encompass many techniques but the one unwavering hallmark of his symphonic compositions is a singular formal pattern that underwent very little variation over the course of his symphonic repertory. In fact, their four extended movements are indebted to the structure and thematic treatment in the late works of [[Beethoven]].<ref name=\"red51\">Redlich (1963), pp.&nbsp;51\u201352</ref> The only large-scale diversion from this formal scheme in the Sixth Symphony is Bruckner's use of [[sonata form]] in the second movement instead of his usual large-scale [[ternary form]].<ref>Wolff (1942), p.&nbsp;168</ref>\n\nThematically speaking, there are two distinct varieties of themes in Bruckner's symphonies. First, there are [[theme (music)|themes]] that are clearly defined in shape and then there are the themes that operate more as [[motif (music)|motives]] with a shorter length and a more open-ended shape, as is typical of the Sixth Symphony.<ref>Wolff (1942), p.&nbsp;166</ref> Another characteristic thematic feature of Bruckner's symphonies is the intimate relationship between the outer two movements, though there is typically more of an emphasis on thematic contrast within the first movement.<ref name=\"red51\" /> Specifically, the amplification of the [[exposition (music)|exposition]] of the first movement consists of two subsidiary themes as well as the primary theme, which are subsequently developed, a technique that is considered uniquely Brucknerian.<ref>Wolff (1942), pp.&nbsp;163, 166</ref>\n\nOther characteristics that are found in Bruckner's symphonies (especially the Sixth) include the extensive treatment of the [[dominant seventh chord]] as a [[German sixth chord]] in a new key, usage of [[cadence (music)|cadences]] as a decisive factor in daring modulations, the treatment of organ points as pivotal to the [[harmony]] and structure, chains of harmonic sequences, and, most notably, extensive use of [[rhythmic]] motives, especially the characteristic [[Bruckner rhythm]], a rhythm consisting of two fourths and three quarter notes, or vice versa.<ref>Wolff (1942), pp.&nbsp;173\u2013174</ref> This rhythm dominated most of the Fourth Symphony and was practically nonexistent in the Fifth Symphony, but becomes nothing short of a driving force in the Sixth Symphony; the metric complexities generated by this unique rhythmic grouping are more pronounced in the first movement of the Sixth Symphony than in any of Bruckner's other compositions.<ref name=\"wat105\">Watson (1996), p.&nbsp;105</ref>\n\n==Orchestration==\nThe [[orchestration]] of the Sixth Symphony complies with Bruckner's customary, albeit peculiar, techniques. Just as in his other symphonic works, there are no marks of extreme virtuosity apparent in the score and the lines are straightforward.<ref>Wolff (1942), p.&nbsp;172</ref> The Sixth Symphony is scored for 2 [[flutes]], 2 [[oboes]], 2 [[clarinets]], 2 [[bassoons]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombones]], [[tuba|bass tuba]], [[timpani]], and [[string section]]. Bruckner commonly alternates between solo and [[tutti]] sections, as well as layering instruments to provide texture and show different subject groups.<ref>Horton \"Bruckner and the Symphony Orchestra\" (2004), p.&nbsp;138</ref>\n\n==Forms, themes, and analysis==\nThe symphony has four movements:\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman\n|Majestoso ([[A major]])\n|Adagio: Sehr feierlich ([[F major]])\n|Scherzo: Nicht schnell \u2014 Trio: Langsam ([[A minor]])\n|Finale: Bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell (A minor \u2192 A major)\n}}\n\n===I. ''Majestoso''===\nBruckner labels this movement \"Majestoso\", not the conventional \"Maestoso\", probably from his Latin (from \"Maiestas\" \u2013 sovereign power). The movement, in obvious [[sonata form]], opens with the characteristic 'Bruckner rhythm' played in the violins, though Bruckner is careful to maintain the enigmatic atmosphere by indicating a bowing that keeps the bow on the string and therefore prohibits the rhythmic figure from becoming too lively.<ref name=\"simp152\">Simpson (1967), p.&nbsp;152</ref> One then hears the quietly intense main theme, a paraphrase of the main theme of Bruckner's own [[Symphony No. 4 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 4]], stated in the low strings and juxtaposed against the pulsating rhythm in the violins:<ref>Engel (1955), p.&nbsp;45\u201346</ref>\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative cis'' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\major \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Majestoso\" 2 = 54\n  <cis cis'>8 \\pp ( \\downbow r16 <cis\n  cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\downbow \\once \\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 \\upbow <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 \\upbow\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  | % 2\n  <cis cis'>8 ( -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  | % 3\n  <cis cis'>8 ( -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  | % 4\n  <cis cis'>8 ( -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  | % 5\n  <cis cis'>8 ( -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  | % 6\n  <cis cis'>8 ( -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam ) \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  <cis cis'>8 -! r16 <cis cis'>16\\noBeam \\once \\override TupletBracket\n  #'stencil = ##f\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8 <cis cis'>8\n  }\n  }\n\\new Staff \\relative e, { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\major \\clef bass \\time 2/2\nR1 | % 2\n  r2 r4 r8 r16 <e e'>16 \\p ^\\markup{ {breit gezogen} } | % 3\n  <e e'>2 <a, a'>2 | % 4\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    r4 <g g'>4 \\< \\upbow <a a'>4\n  }\n  \\times 2/3  {\n    <bes bes'>4 <a a'>4 <g g'>4\n  }\n  | % 5\n  <a a'>2. \\! \\> <f' f'>4 | % 6\n  <e e'>2 \\! r2 }\n>> }\n</score>\n\nThe key is [[A major]] when the first theme enters; however, the mystery is heightened by notes outside the realm of A major tonality that appear in the melodic line, namely the pitches G, B{{flat}} and F, [[Neapolitan chord|Neapolitan]] inflections that will have large-scale tonal effects that come to fruition later in the symphony. The counterstatement of the theme appears (bar 25) in ''fortissimo'', a long-established classical technique that Bruckner had yet to use at the beginning of a symphony.<ref name=\"simp152\" />\n\nThe second theme group is more complex than the primary theme.

From the outset (bar 159), the violins play an inversion of the main theme, though the Bruckner rhythm that accompanied it in the [[exposition (music)|exposition]] is absent.<ref>Doernberg (1960), p.&nbsp;176</ref> Instead, the development is propelled throughout by the triplet motif that first appeared in the third subject of the exposition.<ref name=\"wat106\">Watson (1996), p.&nbsp;106</ref> Harmonically, the development encompasses a myriad of modulations, abruptly traversing between [[E-flat major|E{{flat}}]] and A major, seemingly signaling the beginning of the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]].<ref>Simpson (1967), p.&nbsp;154</ref>\n\nThe beginning of the recapitulation is, in fact, a climax, serving as both the end of the development and the beginning of the recapitulation, marking the first time in symphonic literature that this has occurred.<ref name=\"eng44\" /> If not for this climactic moment, one could have trouble identifying the exact moment of recapitulation as the return of the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] and the return of the primary theme do not coincide (in fact, there are 15 bars in between the two events).<ref>Korstvedt (2001), p.&nbsp;193</ref> In true Bruckner form, it encompasses a complete restatement of the theme groups from the exposition and is otherwise uneventful, setting the stage for the coda which [[Donald Tovey]] described as one of Bruckner's greatest passages.<ref name=\"simp156\">Simpson (1967), pp.&nbsp;156\u2013157</ref> In the [[coda (music)|Coda]], Bruckner passes through the entire spectrum of tonality, leaving no key unsuggested; however, he establishes no tonal center except for A major.<ref name=\"simp156\" /> The opening phrase of the first theme appears throughout, joined (bar 345) by the rhythmic motive from the beginning.

One of the most fascinating features of the harmonic structure is Bruckner's avoidance of a [[root (chord)|root position]] tonic chord for much of the movement.<ref name=\"wat107\">Watson (1996), pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107</ref> The first twenty bars of the movement once again rest on a dominant pedal and when the bass finally moves to the tonic pitch (A), it is not a root position tonic chord; instead, it acts as the bottom of a [[first inversion]] chord of F major (bar 21).<ref name=\"simp160\" />\n\nIn the development, one sees the addition of a new [[motif (music)|motif]] and harmonically, the section centers around [[D-flat major|D{{flat}} major]], [[G-flat major|G{{flat}} major]], and B{{flat}} minor, all closely related keys but ones that are isolated from the tonic (A minor). The dominant of A minor is reached (bar 75) and here, the recapitulation begins, once again over a dominant pedal. It is important to note that there has still not been a root chord of A minor. This elusive A minor root chord finally appears at the end of the recapitulation leading into the [[C major]] [[ternary form|Trio]] section.<ref>Simpson (1967), p.&nbsp;161</ref>\n\nThe slow trio is in the style of a [[L\u00e4ndler]], an Austrian folk dance and, according to Williamson, confirms that in Bruckner's works, it [the trio] is a place for construction in [[timbre|tone color]] as in the moment when horn and [[pizzicato]] strings compete on the same rhythmic figure:<ref>Williamson (2004), p.&nbsp;90</ref>\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative as { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"pizzicato strings\" \\key c \\major \\clef treble \\time 2/4 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Langsam\" 4 = 52\n  r8. ^\"pizz.\" \\p <as es' fis>16 <fis' as\n  es'>16. <as, es' fis>32 <as es' fis>16. <as' es' fis>32 | % 2\n  <as es' fis>8 r16 <es fis as>16 <fis as es'>16. <es fis as>32 <fis\n  as es'>16. <es' fis as>32 | % 3\n  <fis as es'>8 r8 r4 }\n\\new Staff \\relative c { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"pizzicato strings\" \\key c \\major \\clef bass \\time 2/4\nc8 ^\"pizz.\" -. r8 r4 | % 2\n  r8 c8 r4 | % 3\n  c8 r8 r4 }\n>> }\n</score>\nIn fact, this dialogue between pizzicato strings, horn and woodwinds is central to the texture of the whole Trio section. Although the key is C major, there are moments of harmonic ambiguity, as in the preceding movements. At one point (bar 5), the strings point towards D{{flat}} major while the woodwinds attempt to assert A{{flat}} major by quoting the inversion of the main theme of [[Symphony No. 5 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 5]] that is in A{{flat}} major.<ref name=\"wat107\" /> The scherzo returns in its entirety at the end of the trio, adhering to a typical large-scale ternary structure.\n\n===IV. ''Finale: Bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell'' (With motion, but not too fast)===\nWatson characterized the Finale as a steady, organic assertion of A major against its Neapolitan relatives. However, this sonata form movement begins with a theme in [[Phrygian mode|Phyrgian]] A minor that once again stresses Neapolitan relationships with the obvious presence of the flat sixth (the pitch being F{{music|natural}}):<ref>Watson (1996), p.&nbsp;107</ref>\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative f' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"paino\" \\key a \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell\" 4 = 120\n  R1*2\\p | % 3\n  r4 <f f'>2 (\n  \\upbow <e e'>8 <d d'>8 ) | % 4\n  <e e'>2 \\< <d d'>8 ( <c c'>8 <b b'>8 <a a'>8 ) | % 5\n  a'4 \\!

(The Fifth, Sixth and Seventh represent Bruckner's period of confidence as a composer and, along with the unfinished Ninth, are as a group the symphonies he did not extensively revise.<ref name=\"simp150\" />) The Sixth was first published in 1899, a task overseen by former Bruckner pupil Cyrill Hynais. This edition did encompass a few minute changes from Bruckner's original, including the repetition of the second half of the Trio in the third movement. The next edition appeared only in 1935, from [[Robert Haas (musicologist)|Robert Haas]] under ''Internationale Bruckner-Gesellschaft'' auspices. In 1952 [[Leopold Nowak]], who took over Haas's job, published an edition that was a replicate of Bruckner's 1881 original score. In 1986 the ''IBG'' issued an \u201caudit\u201d of the efforts of Hynais, Haas and Nowak, and in 1997 it republished the Nowak.\n\nThe version of the Sixth performed under the direction of Mahler for the 1899 premiere was never published;<ref name=\"simp124\" /> Mahler had made substantial changes to the whole score before that performance, of course unsanctioned by the deceased Bruckner.<ref>Barford (1978), p.&nbsp;50</ref> There exists also an inauthentic edition by Schalk.\n\n==Critical and cultural reception==\nCriticism of Bruckner's Symphony No. 6 is similar to the critical response that his preceding symphonies had received. Whereas Bruckner considered his Sixth Symphony to be his \"boldest symphony,\" it was not generally held in high regard.<ref>Simpson (1967), p.&nbsp;136</ref> In terms of interpretation, the Sixth Symphony has also been the unluckiest, with the vast majority of conductors ignoring Bruckner's specific tempo markings and throwing off the carefully planned balance of the movements.<ref>Simpson (1967), p.&nbsp;168</ref> One 2004 reviewer for ''[[The Musical Times]]'' referred to the inner movements of this symphony as \"flawed but attractive enough\" and dubbed the outer movements \"burdensome.\"<ref name=\"hort5\">Horton ''Bruckner's Symphonies'' (2004), p.&nbsp;5</ref>\n\nHanslick, as usual, was without a doubt the harshest critic of them all. He was once quoted as saying, \"whom I wish to destroy shall be destroyed,\" and Bruckner seems to have been a prime target.<ref name=\"harr32\" /> After hearing the 1883 performance of the middle movements of the Sixth Symphony, Hanslick wrote:\n<blockquote>\nIt has become ever harder for me personally to achieve a proper relationship with these peculiar compositions in which clever, original, and even inspired moments alternate frequently without recognizable connection with barely understandable platitudes, empty and dull patches, stretched out over such unsparing length as to threaten to run players as well as listeners out of breath.<ref name=\"harr32\" />\n</blockquote>\nHere, Hanslick touched on the most common complaint about Bruckner's symphonic writing: the seemingly endless journey to a conclusion of musical thought. [[Dyneley Hussey]] critiqued the Sixth Symphony in a 1957 review for ''The Musical Times'' and reached the same conclusions half a century later, writing: <blockquote>\nHis most tiresome habit is his way of pulling up dead at frequent intervals, and then starting the argument all over again...One has the impression...that we are traversing a town with innumerable traffic lights, all of which turn red as we approach them.<ref name=\"hort5\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nHarsh critical reception of the Sixth Symphony, as well as his entire body of work, can also be attributed to critical reception of Bruckner as a person. He was a devout Catholic whose religious fervor often had a negative effect on those he encountered. One of his pupils, [[Franz Schalk]], commented that it was the age of moral and spiritual liberalism...but also in which he [Bruckner] intruded...with his medieval, monasterial concept of humankind and life.<ref>Floros (2001), p.&nbsp;289</ref>\n\nRegardless of the criticisms, both musical and personal, there were some who attempted to find the beauty in Bruckner's Sixth Symphony. [[Donald Tovey]] wrote, \"...if one clears their mind, not only of prejudice but of wrong points of view, and treats Bruckner's Sixth Symphony as a kind of music we have never heard before, there is no doubt that its high quality will strike us at every moment\".<ref>Simpson (1967), p.&nbsp;123</ref> Still others marvel over the rarity of performances of the Sixth Symphony, citing its bright character and key and its plethora of tender, memorable themes as grounds for more widespread acceptance.<ref name=\"wat105\" />\n\nCarl Hruby wrote that Bruckner once said that if he were to speak to Beethoven about bad critiques Beethoven would say, \"My dear Bruckner, don't bother yourself about it. It was no better for me, and the same gentlemen who use me as a stick to beat you with still don't understand my last quartets, however much they may pretend to.\"<ref>Jackson (2001), p.&nbsp;207</ref> In saying this, Bruckner both acknowledged his bad critiques and maintained hope that his own compositions might one day garner the same type of positive reaction that Beethoven's music received from his contemporaries.\n\n==Performance and recording history==\n[[File:Bruckner6recording.jpg|thumb|right|200x200 pixels|Cover of the [[Otto Klemperer|Klemperer]]/[[Philharmonia Orchestra|New Philharmonia]] 1964 recording, reissued 2003]]\nThe first performance of Bruckner's Symphony No. 6 was by the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] conducted by [[Wilhelm Jahn]] on February 11, 1883, making it the only performance of the piece that Bruckner heard in his lifetime. However, only the two middle movements were performed. The first complete performance of the Sixth Symphony occurred in 1899 conducted by Gustav Mahler who made substantial changes to the score. The first full performance of the original score took place in [[Stuttgart]] in 1901, conducted by [[Karl Pohlig]].<ref name=\"simp124\" /> Since that first full performance, the Sixth Symphony has become part of the symphonic repertory, but is the least performed of Bruckner's symphonies, never overcoming its original status as a symphonic \"stepchild\".<ref>Korstvedt (2001), p.&nbsp;185</ref>\n\nThe oldest surviving recorded performance is of [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] conducting the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in 1943; however, the first movement is missing. The oldest surviving ''complete'' recorded performance is of [[Georg Ludwig Jochum]] with the [[Bruckner Orchestra Linz]] from 1944. The first commercial recording is from 1950 and features [[Henry Swoboda]] and the [[Vienna Symphony Orchestra]].\n\n==Selected discography==\n* Otto Klemperer and New Philharmonia Orchestra \u00a92003 EMI Records Ltd (recorded November 1964)\n* Eugen Jochum and Symphonie-Orchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks \u00a91966 Deutsche Grammophon\n* [[William Steinberg]] and [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] \u00a91972 RCA\n* Horst Stein and Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra \u00a91974 Decca\n* Daniel Barenboim and Chicago Symphony Orchestra \u00a91977 Deutsche Grammophon\n* Herbert von Karajan and [[Berliner Philharmoniker]] \u00a91979 Deutsche Grammophon\n* Sir Georg Solti and Chicago Symphony Orchestra \u00a91979 Decca\n* Wolfgang Sawallisch and Bayerisches Staatsorchester \u00a91982 Orfeo\n* Ferdinand Leitner and SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und Freiburg \u00a91982 H\u00e4nssler Classic\n* Riccardo Muti and Berliner Philharmoniker \u00a91988 EMI\n* Eliahu Inbal and Radio-Sinfonie-Orchester Frankfurt \u00a91989 Teldec\n* Herbert Blomstedt and San Francisco Symphony Orchestra \u00a91990 London\n* Jesus Lopez-Cobos and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra \u00a91991 Telarc\n* Bernard Haitink and [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] \u00a91994 Universal International Music B.V.\n* Christoph von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra \u00a91994 London\n* Gunter Wand and NDR-Sinfonieorchester \u00a91996 RCA Victor\n* Eugen Jochum and Staatskapelle Dresden \u00a91998 EMI Records Ltd.\n* Sergiu Celibidache and M\u00fcnchner Philharmoniker \u00a91999 EMI Records, Ltd.\n* Riccardo Chailly and [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] \u00a91999 Decca\n* Christoph Eschenbach and Houston Symphony Orchestra \u00a92000 Koch Int.\n* Eugen Jochum and Staatskapelle Dresden \u00a92000 EMI Records Ltd.\n* Sir Colin Davis and London Symphony Orchestra \u00a92002 London Symphony Orchestra Ltd.\n* Michael Gielen and SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und Freiburg \u00a92002 H\u00e4nssler Classic\n* Eugen Jochum and [[Berliner Philharmoniker]] \u00a92002 Deutsche Grammophon\n* Kurt Masur and Gewandhausorchester Leipzig \u00a92004 BMG Music\n* \"[[Alberto Lizzio]]\" and \"South German Philharmonic Orchestra\" \u00a92005 Point Classics.<small>Note: No such performers exist. \"Alberto Lizzio\" was a pseudonym invented by bargain-record producer [[Alfred Scholz]] and attached to older performances (often conducted by [[Hans Swarowsky]], [[Milan Horvat]], [[Carl Melles]] or himself).
