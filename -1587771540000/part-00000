In one such pathway, some cells do not have the usual [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s on their surfaces that viruses use to gain entry. The antiviral proteins (i.e., the [[antibodies]]) bind to antibody [[Fc receptor]]s that some of these cells have in the [[plasma membrane]]. The viruses bind to the antigen binding site at the other end of the antibody. [[Dengue virus]] can use this mechanism to infect human [[macrophage]]s, causing a normally mild viral infection to become life-threatening.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Dimmock NJ, Easton AJ, Leppard K |title=Introduction to modern virology |year=2007 |publisher=Blackwell Pub. |location=Malden, MA |isbn=978-1-4051-3645-7 |page=65}}</ref>\n\nAn ongoing question in the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] is whether\u2014and if so, to what extent\u2014COVID-19 receives ADE from other coronaviruses.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tetro JA | title = Is COVID-19 receiving ADE from other coronaviruses? | journal = Microbes and Infection | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 72\u201373 | date = March 2020 | pmid = 32092539 | pmc = 7102551 | doi = 10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.006 }}</ref>\n\n== In coronavirus infection ==\nNon-human primates vaccinated with modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus encoding full-length SARS-COV spike glycoprotein and challenged with the [[SARS-CoV]] virus had lower viral loads but suffered from acute lung injury due to antibody enhancement.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu L et al | display-authors = 1 | title = Anti\u2013spike IgG causes severe acute lung injury by skewing macrophage responses during acute SARS-CoV infection | journal = JCI Insight | date = 2019 | url = https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/123158}}</ref> A study of 29 hospitalized and subsequently recovered [[Coronavirus disease 2019]] (COVID-19) patients after [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] (SARS-COV-2) infection found that 100% of patients had anti-spike antibodies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang H et al | display-authors = 1 | title = Global profiling of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses of convalescents using a proteome microarray | journal = Medxriv Pre-Print | date = 2020 | url = https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039495v1}}</ref> Anti-spike IgG correlated linearly with age and LDH (a biomarker of disease severity often elevated in [[cytokine release syndrome]]).

In such cases, the clinical course of the disease is more severe, and these people have higher [[viremia]] compared with those in whom ADE has not occurred. This explains the observation that while primary (first) infections cause mostly minor disease (dengue fever) in children, secondary infection (re-infection at a later date) is more likely to be associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome in both children and adults.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guzman MG, Vazquez S | title = The complexity of antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection | journal = Viruses | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 2649\u201362 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21994635 | pmc = 3185591 | doi = 10.3390/v2122649 }}</ref>\n\nThere are four [[antigen]]ically different [[serotype]]s of dengue virus (dengue virus 1\u20134).<ref name=King2002/> In 2013 a fifth serotype was reported.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Normile D | year = 2013 | title = Tropical medicine.

Infection with dengue virus also produces some degree of [[cross-reactivity|cross-protective]] immunity against the other three serotypes.<ref name=Alvarez2006/> Neutralizing heterotypic (cross-reactive) IgG antibodies are responsible for this cross-protective immunity, which typically persists for a period of several months to a few years. These heterotypic antibody [[titer]]s decrease over long time periods (4 to 20 years).<ref name=Guzman2007/> While heterotypic IgG antibody titers decrease, homotypic IgG antibody titers increase over long time periods. This could be due to the preferential survival of long-lived [[memory B cell]]s producing homotypic antibodies.<ref name=Guzman2007/>\n\nIn addition to inducing neutralizing heterotypic antibodies, infection with dengue virus can also induce heterotypic antibodies which neutralize the virus only partially or not at all.<ref name=Goncalvez2007/> The production of such cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies could be the reason for more severe secondary infections. It is thought that by binding to but not neutralizing the virus, these antibodies cause it to behave as a \"[[Trojan Horse|trojan horse]]\",<ref name=Peluso1985/><ref name=Chen2002/><ref name=Witayathawornwong2005/> where it is delivered into the wrong compartment of [[dendritic cell]]s that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Rodenhuis2010/><ref name=Guzman2010/> Once inside the white blood cell, the virus replicates undetected, eventually generating very high virus titers which cause severe disease.<ref name=Dejnirattisai2010/>\n\nA study conducted by Modhiran et al.<ref name=Modhiran2010/> attempted to explain how non-neutralizing antibodies down regulate the immune response in the host cell through the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Toll-like receptors are known to recognize extra- and intracellular viral particles and to be a major basis of the cytokines production. In vitro experiments showed that the inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production was reduced when the ADE-dengue virus complex bound to the Fc receptor of THP-1 cells. This can be explained by both a decrease of Toll-like receptorproduction and a modification of its signaling pathway. On one hand, an unknown protein induced by the stimulated Fc receptor reduces the Toll-like receptor transcription and translation, which reduce the capacity of the cell to detect viral proteins. On the other hand, many proteins (TRIF, TRAF6, TRAM, TIRAP, IKK\u03b1, TAB1, TAB2, NF-\u03baB complex) involved in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway are down regulated, which led to a decrease of the cytokine production. Two of them, TRIF and TRAF6, are respectively down regulated by 2 proteins SARM and TANK up regulated by the stimulated Fc receptors.\n\nTo illustrate the phenomenon of ADE, consider the following example: an epidemic of dengue fever occurred in [[Cuba]], lasting from 1977 to 1979. The infecting serotype was dengue virus-1. This epidemic was followed by two more outbreaks of dengue fever\u2014one in 1981 and one in 1997; dengue virus-2 was the infecting serotype in both of these later epidemics. 205 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome occurred during the 1997 outbreak, all in people older than 15 years. All but three of these cases were demonstrated to have been previously infected by the dengue virus-1 serotype during the epidemic of 1977\u20131979.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Furthermore, people who had been infected with dengue virus-1 during the 1977-79 outbreak and secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1997 had a 3-4 fold [[Odds ratio|increased probability]] of developing severe disease than those secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1981.<ref name=Guzman2007/> This scenario can be explained by the presence of neutralizing heterotypic IgG antibodies in sufficient titers in 1981, the titers of which had decreased by 1997 to the point where they no longer provided significant cross-protective immunity.\n\n==In HIV-1 virus infection==\nADE of infection has also been reported in HIV. Like dengue virus, non-neutralizing level of antibodies have been found to enhance the viral infection through interactions of complement system and receptors.<ref name=Willey2001/> The increase in infection has been reported to be over 350 fold which is comparable to ADE in other viruses like dengue virus.<ref name=Willey2001/> ADE in HIV can be complement mediated or Fc receptor mediated. Complements in presence of HIV-1 positive sera have been found to enhance the infection of MT-2 T-cell line. The Fc-receptor mediated enhancement was reported when HIV infection was enhanced by sera from HIV-1 positive guinea pig enhanced the infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells without the presence of any complements.<ref name=Levy2007/> Complement component receptors CR2, CR3 and CR4 have been found to mediate this Complement-mediated enhancement of infection.<ref name=Willey2001/><ref name=Yu2010/> The infection of HIV-1 leads to activation of complements fragments of these complements can assist viruses with infection by facilitating viral interactions with host cells that express complement receptors.<ref name=Gras1991/> The deposition of complement on the virus brings the gp120 protein close to CD4 molecules on the surface of the cells, thus leading to facilitated viral entry.<ref name=Gras1991/> Viruses pre-exposed to non-neutralizing complement system have also been found to enhance infections in interdigitating dendritic cells. [[Opsonin|Opsonized]] viruses have not only shown enhanced entry but also favorable signalling cascades for HIV replication in interdigitating dendritic cells.<ref name=Bouhlal2007/> HIV-1 has also showed enhancement of infection in HT-29 cells when the viruses were pre-opsonized with complements C3 and C9 in seminal fluid. This enhanced rate of infection was almost 2 times greater than infection of HT-29 cells with virus alone.<ref name=Bouhlal2002/> Subramanian ''et al.'', reported that almost 72% of serum samples out of 39 HIV positive individuals contained complements that were known to enhance the infection. They also suggested that presence of neutralizing antibody or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating antibodies in the serum contains infection-enhancing antibodies.<ref name=Subramanian2002/> The balance between the neutralizing antibodies and infection-enhancing antibodies changes as the disease progresses. During advanced stages of disease the proportion of infection-enhancing antibodies are generally higher than neutralizing antibodies.<ref name=Beck2008/> Increase in viral protein synthesis and RNA production have been reported to occur during the complement mediated enhancement of infection. Cells that are challenged with non neutralizing levels of complements have been found have accelerated release of reverse transcriptase and the viral progeny.<ref name=Robinson1990/> The interaction of anti-HIV antibodies with non-neutralizing complement exposed viruses also aid in binding of the virus and the erythrocytes which can lead to a more efficient delivery of viruses to the immune compromised organs.<ref name=Yu2010/>\n\nADE in HIV has raised questions about the risk of infections to volunteers who have taken subneutralizing levels of vaccine just like any other viruses that exhibit ADE. Gilbert ''et al.'', in 2005 reported that there was no ADE of infection when they used rgp120 vaccine in phase 1 and 2 trials.<ref name=Gilbert2005/> It has been emphasized that much research needs to be done in the field of immunity response to HIV-1, information from these studies can be used to produce a more effective vaccine.\n\n==Mechanism==\nThere are several possibilities to explain the phenomenon:\n# A viral surface protein laced with antibodies against a virus of one serotype binds to a similar virus with a different serotype. The binding is meant to neutralize the virus surface protein from attaching to the cell, but the antibody bound to virus also binds to the receptor of the cell, the Fc-region antibody receptor Fc\u03b3R. This brings the virus into close proximity to the virus-specific receptor, and the cell [[endocytosis|internalizes]] the virus through the normal infection route.<ref name=TakadaKawaoka2003/>\n# A virus surface protein may be attached to antibodies of a different serotype, activating the classical pathway of the [[complement system]]. The complement cascade system instead binds [[C1Q complex]] attached to the virus surface protein via the antibodies, which in turn bind C1q receptor found on cells, bringing the virus and the cell close enough for a specific virus receptor to bind the virus, beginning infection.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} This mechanism has not been shown specifically for dengue virus infection, but is supposed to occur with Ebola virus infection ''in vitro''.<ref name=TakadaFeldmann2003/>\n# When an antibody to a virus is present for a different serotype, it is unable to neutralize the virus, which is then ingested into the cell as a sub-neutralized virus particle. These viruses are [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]] as antigen-antibody complexes, and degraded by [[macrophage]]s. Upon ingestion the antibodies no longer even sub-neutralize the body due to the denaturing condition at the step for acidification of phagosome before fusion with [[lysosome]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} The virus becomes active and begins its proliferation within the cell.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Original antigenic sin]]\n* Other ways in which antibodies can

antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), antibodies bind to both viral particles and Fc gamma receptors expressed on immune cells, increasing the likelihood that the viruses will infect those

Infection with dengue virus also produces some degree of [[cross-reactivity|cross-protective]] immunity against the other three serotypes.<ref name=Alvarez2006/> Neutralizing heterotypic (cross-reactive) IgG antibodies are responsible for this cross-protective immunity, which typically persists for a period of several months to a few years. These heterotypic antibody [[titer]]s decrease over long time periods (4 to 20 years).<ref name=Guzman2007/> While heterotypic IgG antibody titers decrease, homotypic IgG antibody titers increase over long time periods. This could be due to the preferential survival of long-lived [[memory B cell]]s producing homotypic antibodies.<ref name=Guzman2007/>\n\nIn addition to inducing neutralizing heterotypic antibodies, infection with dengue virus can also induce heterotypic antibodies which neutralize the virus only partially or not at all.<ref name=Goncalvez2007/> The production of such cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies could be the reason for more severe secondary infections. It is thought that by binding to but not neutralizing the virus, these antibodies cause it to behave as a \"[[Trojan Horse|trojan horse]]\",<ref name=Peluso1985/><ref name=Chen2002/><ref name=Witayathawornwong2005/> where it is delivered into the wrong compartment of [[dendritic cell]]s that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Rodenhuis2010/><ref name=Guzman2010/> Once inside the white blood cell, the virus replicates undetected, eventually generating very high virus titers which cause severe disease.<ref name=Dejnirattisai2010/>\n\nA study conducted by Modhiran et al.<ref name=Modhiran2010/> attempted to explain how non-neutralizing antibodies down regulate the immune response in the host cell through the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Toll-like receptors are known to recognize extra- and intracellular viral particles and to be a major basis of the cytokines production. In vitro experiments showed that the inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production was reduced when the ADE-dengue virus complex bound to the Fc receptor of THP-1 cells. This can be explained by both a decrease of Toll-like receptorproduction and a modification of its signaling pathway. On one hand, an unknown protein induced by the stimulated Fc receptor reduces the Toll-like receptor transcription and translation, which reduce the capacity of the cell to detect viral proteins. On the other hand, many proteins (TRIF, TRAF6, TRAM, TIRAP, IKK\u03b1, TAB1, TAB2, NF-\u03baB complex) involved in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway are down regulated, which led to a decrease of the cytokine production. Two of them, TRIF and TRAF6, are respectively down regulated by 2 proteins SARM and TANK up regulated by the stimulated Fc receptors.\n\nTo illustrate the phenomenon of ADE, consider the following example: an epidemic of dengue fever occurred in [[Cuba]], lasting from 1977 to 1979. The infecting serotype was dengue virus-1. This epidemic was followed by two more outbreaks of dengue fever\u2014one in 1981 and one in 1997; dengue virus-2 was the infecting serotype in both of these later epidemics. 205 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome occurred during the 1997 outbreak, all in people older than 15 years. All but three of these cases were demonstrated to have been previously infected by the dengue virus-1 serotype during the epidemic of 1977\u20131979.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Furthermore, people who had been infected with dengue virus-1 during the 1977-79 outbreak and secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1997 had a 3-4 fold [[Odds ratio|increased probability]] of developing severe disease than those secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1981.<ref name=Guzman2007/> This scenario can be explained by the presence of neutralizing heterotypic IgG antibodies in sufficient titers in 1981, the titers of which had decreased by 1997 to the point where they no longer provided significant cross-protective immunity.\n\n==In HIV-1 virus infection==\nADE of infection has also been reported in HIV. Like dengue virus, non-neutralizing level of antibodies have been found to enhance the viral infection through interactions of complement system and receptors.<ref name=Willey2001/> The increase in infection has been reported to be over 350 fold which is comparable to ADE in other viruses like dengue virus.<ref name=Willey2001/> ADE in HIV can be complement mediated or Fc receptor mediated. Complements in presence of HIV-1 positive sera have been found to enhance the infection of MT-2 T-cell line. The Fc-receptor mediated enhancement was reported when HIV infection was enhanced by sera from HIV-1 positive guinea pig enhanced the infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells without the presence of any complements.<ref name=Levy2007/> Complement component receptors CR2, CR3 and CR4 have been found to mediate this Complement-mediated enhancement of infection.<ref name=Willey2001/><ref name=Yu2010/> The infection of HIV-1 leads to activation of complements fragments of these complements can assist viruses with infection by facilitating viral interactions with host cells that express complement receptors.<ref name=Gras1991/> The deposition of complement on the virus brings the gp120 protein close to CD4 molecules on the surface of the cells, thus leading to facilitated viral entry.<ref name=Gras1991/> Viruses pre-exposed to non-neutralizing complement system have also been found to enhance infections in interdigitating dendritic cells. [[Opsonin|Opsonized]] viruses have not only shown enhanced entry but also favorable signalling cascades for HIV replication in interdigitating dendritic cells.<ref name=Bouhlal2007/> HIV-1 has also showed enhancement of infection in HT-29 cells when the viruses were pre-opsonized with complements C3 and C9 in seminal fluid. This enhanced rate of infection was almost 2 times greater than infection of HT-29 cells with virus alone.<ref name=Bouhlal2002/> Subramanian ''et al.'', reported that almost 72% of serum samples out of 39 HIV positive individuals contained complements that were known to enhance the infection. They also suggested that presence of neutralizing antibody or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating antibodies in the serum contains infection-enhancing antibodies.<ref name=Subramanian2002/> The balance between the neutralizing antibodies and infection-enhancing antibodies changes as the disease progresses. During advanced stages of disease the proportion of infection-enhancing antibodies are generally higher than neutralizing antibodies.<ref name=Beck2008/> Increase in viral protein synthesis and RNA production have been reported to occur during the complement mediated enhancement of infection. Cells that are challenged with non neutralizing levels of complements have been found have accelerated release of reverse transcriptase and the viral progeny.<ref name=Robinson1990/> The interaction of anti-HIV antibodies with non-neutralizing complement exposed viruses also aid in binding of the virus and the erythrocytes which can lead to a more efficient delivery of viruses to the immune compromised organs.<ref name=Yu2010/>\n\nADE in HIV has raised questions about the risk of infections to volunteers who have taken subneutralizing levels of vaccine just like any other viruses that exhibit ADE. Gilbert ''et al.'', in 2005 reported that there was no ADE of infection when they used rgp120 vaccine in phase 1 and 2 trials.<ref name=Gilbert2005/> It has been emphasized that much research needs to be done in the field of immunity response to HIV-1, information from these studies can be used to produce a more effective vaccine.\n\n==Mechanism==\nThere are several possibilities to explain the phenomenon:\n# A viral surface protein laced with antibodies against a virus of one serotype binds to a similar virus with a different serotype. The binding is meant to neutralize the virus surface protein from attaching to the cell, but the antibody bound to virus also binds to the receptor of the cell, the Fc-region antibody receptor Fc\u03b3R. This brings the virus into close proximity to the virus-specific receptor, and the cell [[endocytosis|internalizes]] the virus through the normal infection route.<ref name=TakadaKawaoka2003/>\n# A virus surface protein may be attached to antibodies of a different serotype, activating the classical pathway of the [[complement system]]. The complement cascade system instead binds [[C1Q complex]] attached to the virus surface protein via the antibodies, which in turn bind C1q receptor found on cells, bringing the virus and the cell close enough for a specific virus receptor to bind the virus, beginning infection.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} This mechanism has not been shown specifically for dengue virus infection, but is supposed to occur with Ebola virus infection ''in vitro''.<ref name=TakadaFeldmann2003/>\n# When an antibody to a virus is present for a different serotype, it is unable to neutralize the virus, which is then ingested into the cell as a sub-neutralized virus particle. These viruses are [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]] as antigen-antibody complexes, and degraded by [[macrophage]]s. Upon ingestion the antibodies no longer even sub-neutralize the body due to the denaturing condition at the step for acidification of phagosome before fusion with [[lysosome]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} The virus becomes active and begins its proliferation within the cell.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Original antigenic sin]]\n* Other ways in which antibodies can

Sand and stones carried by the watercourse therefore increase erosion capacity.<ref name=\"fenh\" /> This causes the waterfall to carve deeper into the bed and to recede upstream. Often over time, the waterfall will recede back to form a canyon or gorge downstream as it recedes upstream, and it will carve deeper into the ridge above it.<ref name=\"visual\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classzone.com/books/earth_science/terc/content/visualizations/es1305/es1305page01.cfm?chapter_no=visualization|title=Observe river erosion creating waterfalls and chasms.|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2016}}</ref> The rate of retreat for a waterfall can be as high as one-and-a-half metres per year.<ref name=\"fenh\" />\n\nOften, the rock [[stratum]] just below the more resistant shelf will be of a softer type, meaning that undercutting due to splashback will occur here to form a shallow cave-like formation known as a [[rock shelter]] under and behind the waterfall. Eventually, the [[outcrop]]ping, more resistant cap rock will collapse under pressure to add blocks of rock to the base of the waterfall. These blocks of rock are then broken down into smaller boulders by [[Attrition (erosion)|attrition]] as they collide with each other, and they also erode the base of the waterfall by [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]], creating a deep [[plunge pool]] in the gorge downstream.\n\nStreams can become wider and shallower just above waterfalls due to flowing over the rock shelf, and there is usually a deep area just below the waterfall because of the [[kinetic energy]] of the water hitting the bottom. However, a study of waterfalls systematics reported that waterfalls can be wider or narrower above or below a falls, so almost anything is possible given the right geological and hydrological setting.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wyrick|first=Joshua R.|last2=Pasternack|first2=Gregory B.|date=1 September 2008|title=Modeling energy dissipation and hydraulic jump regime responses to channel nonuniformity at river steps|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface|language=en|volume=113|issue=F3|pages=F03003|doi=10.1029/2007jf000873|issn=2156-2202|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/98m7s64p}}</ref> Waterfalls normally form in a rocky area due to erosion. After a long period of being fully formed, the water falling off the ledge will retreat, causing a horizontal pit parallel to the waterfall wall. Eventually, as the pit grows deeper, the waterfall collapses to be replaced by a steeply sloping stretch of river bed.<ref name=\"fenh\"/> In addition to gradual processes such as erosion, earth movement caused by [[earthquake]]s or [[landslide]]s or [[volcano]]es can [[cause]] a differential in land heights which interfere with the natural course of a water flow, and result in waterfalls.\n\nA river sometimes flows over a large step in the rocks that may have been formed by a [[Fault (geology)|fault line]]. Waterfalls can occur along the edge of a [[glacial trough]], where a stream or river flowing into a [[glacier]] continues to flow into a valley after the glacier has receded or melted. The large waterfalls in [[Yosemite Valley]] are examples of this phenomenon, which is referred to as a [[Valley#Hanging valleys|hanging valley]]. Another reason hanging valleys may form is where two rivers join and one is flowing faster than the other.<ref name=\"fenh\"/>\n\nWaterfalls can be grouped into ten broad classes based on the average volume of water present on the fall (which depends on both the waterfall's average flow and its height) using a [[logarithmic scale]].  Class 10 waterfalls include [[Niagara Falls]], [[Paulo Afonso Falls]] and [[Khone Falls]].\n\nClasses of other well-known waterfalls include [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] and [[Kaieteur Falls]] (Class 9); [[Rhine Falls]] and [[Gullfoss]] (Class 8); [[Angel Falls]] and [[Dettifoss]] (Class 7); [[Yosemite Falls]], [[Yellowstone Falls|Lower Yellowstone Falls]], and [[Umphang Thee Lor Sue Waterfall]] (Class 6); and [[Sutherland Falls]] (Class 5).<ref>Richard H.

Sand and stones carried by the watercourse therefore increase erosion capacity.<ref name=\"fenh\" /> This causes the waterfall to carve deeper into the bed and to recede upstream. Often over time, the waterfall will recede back to form a canyon or gorge downstream as it recedes upstream, and it will carve deeper into the ridge above it.<ref name=\"visual\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classzone.com/books/earth_science/terc/content/visualizations/es1305/es1305page01.cfm?chapter_no=visualization|title=Observe river erosion creating waterfalls and chasms.|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2016}}</ref> The rate of retreat for a waterfall can be as high as one-and-a-half metres per year.<ref name=\"fenh\" />\n\nOften, the rock [[stratum]] just below the more resistant shelf will be of a softer type, meaning that undercutting due to splashback will occur here to form a shallow cave-like formation known as a [[rock shelter]] under and behind the waterfall. Eventually, the [[outcrop]]ping, more resistant cap rock will collapse under pressure to add blocks of rock to the base of the waterfall. These blocks of rock are then broken down into smaller boulders by [[Attrition (erosion)|attrition]] as they collide with each other, and they also erode the base of the waterfall by [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]], creating a deep [[plunge pool]] in the gorge downstream.\n\nStreams can become wider and shallower just above waterfalls due to flowing over the rock shelf, and there is usually a deep area just below the waterfall because of the [[kinetic energy]] of the water hitting the bottom. However, a study of waterfalls systematics reported that waterfalls can be wider or narrower above or below a falls, so almost anything is possible given the right geological and hydrological setting.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wyrick|first=Joshua R.|last2=Pasternack|first2=Gregory B.|date=1 September 2008|title=Modeling energy dissipation and hydraulic jump regime responses to channel nonuniformity at river steps|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface|language=en|volume=113|issue=F3|pages=F03003|doi=10.1029/2007jf000873|issn=2156-2202|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/98m7s64p}}</ref> Waterfalls normally form in a rocky area due to erosion. After a long period of being fully formed, the water falling off the ledge will retreat, causing a horizontal pit parallel to the waterfall wall. Eventually, as the pit grows deeper, the waterfall collapses to be replaced by a steeply sloping stretch of river bed.<ref name=\"fenh\"/> In addition to gradual processes such as erosion, earth movement caused by [[earthquake]]s or [[landslide]]s or [[volcano]]es can [[cause]] a differential in land heights which interfere with the natural course of a water flow, and result in waterfalls.\n\nA river sometimes flows over a large step in the rocks that may have been formed by a [[Fault (geology)|fault line]]. Waterfalls can occur along the edge of a [[glacial trough]], where a stream or river flowing into a [[glacier]] continues to flow into a valley after the glacier has receded or melted. The large waterfalls in [[Yosemite Valley]] are examples of this phenomenon, which is referred to as a [[Valley#Hanging valleys|hanging valley]]. Another reason hanging valleys may form is where two rivers join and one is flowing faster than the other.<ref name=\"fenh\"/>\n\nWaterfalls can be grouped into ten broad classes based on the average volume of water present on the fall (which depends on both the waterfall's average flow and its height) using a [[logarithmic scale]].  Class 10 waterfalls include [[Niagara Falls]], [[Paulo Afonso Falls]] and [[Khone Falls]].\n\nClasses of other well-known waterfalls include [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] and [[Kaieteur Falls]] (Class 9); [[Rhine Falls]] and [[Gullfoss]] (Class 8); [[Angel Falls]] and [[Dettifoss]] (Class 7); [[Yosemite Falls]], [[Yellowstone Falls|Lower Yellowstone Falls]], and [[Umphang Thee Lor Sue Waterfall]] (Class 6); and [[Sutherland Falls]] (Class 5).<ref>Richard H.
