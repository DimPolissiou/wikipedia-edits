Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

For Domitian feared the coming of Christ as Herod also had feared it. And he asked them if they were descendants of David, and they confessed that they were. Then he asked them how much property they had, or how much money they owned. And both of them answered that they had only nine thousand [[denarii]], half of which belonged to each of them;\n:and this property did not consist of silver, but of a piece of land which contained only thirty-nine [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Area|acres]], and from which they raised their taxes and supported themselves by their own labor.\"\nThen they showed their hands, exhibiting the hardness of their bodies and the callousness produced upon their hands by continuous toil as evidence of their own labor.\nAnd when they were asked concerning Christ and his kingdom, of what sort it was and where and when it was to appear, they answered that it was not a temporal nor an earthly kingdom, but a heavenly and angelic one, which would appear at the end of the world, when he should come in glory to judge the quick and the dead, and to give unto every one according to his works.\nUpon hearing this, Domitian did not pass judgment against them, but, despising them as of no account, he let them go, and by a decree put a stop to the persecution of the Church.\nBut when they were released they ruled the churches because they were witnesses and were also relatives of the Lord.
