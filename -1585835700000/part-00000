Modern windows are usually [[glazing (window)|glazed]] or covered in some other [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] or translucent material, a [[Window sash|sash]] set in a frame<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window.<ref name=\"Window\">{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/window/ |title=Window |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref> Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather. Windows often have a [[Latch (hardware)|latch]] or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.\n\nTypes include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, single-hung and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding [[sash window]]s, [[casement window]]s, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or [[louver]]ed windows, [[clerestory]] windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, emergency exit windows, [[stained glass]] windows, French windows, panel windows, and double - and triple paned windows.\n\nThe Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], in [[Alexandria]] ca. 100 AD. Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In [[England]], glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened [[animal horn]] were used as early as the 14th century. In the 19th century American west, [[greased paper window]]s came to be used by itinerant groups. Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were fully perfected.\n\n=\n' originates from the [[Old Norse]] 'vindauga', from 'vindr{{snd}} wind' and 'auga{{snd}} eye', i.e., ''wind eye''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com |title=New Oxford American Dictionary |date=2010}}</ref> In [[Norwegian Language|Norwegian]] [[Nynorsk]] and [[Icelandic Language|Icelandic]] the Old Norse form has survived to this day (in Icelandic only as a less used word for a type of small open \"window\", not strictly a synonym for ''gluggi'', the Icelandic word for window<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=71376|title=Hva\u00f0an kemur or\u00f0i\u00f0 gluggi?

The Danish (but not the Bokm\u00e5l) word is pronounced fairly similarly to ''window''.\n\n''Window'' is first recorded in the early 13th century, and originally referred to an unglazed hole in a roof. ''Window'' replaced the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''eag\u00feyrl'', which literally means 'eye-hole,' and 'eagduru' 'eye-door'. Many Germanic languages however adopted the Latin word 'fenestra' to describe a window with glass, such as [[Standard language|standard]] [[Swedish language|Swedish]] 'f\u00f6nster', or [[German language|German]] 'Fenster'. The use of ''window'' in English is probably because of the Scandinavian influence on the English language by means of [[loanwords]] during the [[Viking Age]].  In English the word ''fenester'' was used as a parallel until the mid-18th century. ''Fenestration'' is still used to describe the arrangement of windows within a [[fa\u00e7ade]], as well as ''[[defenestration]]'', meaning to throw something out of a window.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roman window glass.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a Roman window glass plate dated to 1st to 4th century A.D.<br />Note the obvious curvature; this is not a flat pane.]]\n[[File:MorellaSantaMariaWindow.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Alabaster]] \"mullion\"-divided decorative windows in Santa Maria La Major church ([[Morella, Castell\u00f3n|Morella]], Spain).]]\n[[File:ValenciaCathedral2.JPG|thumb|upright|Alabaster window in the [[Valencia Cathedral]]. Note the asymmetrical, slanted left side of the wall-frame, which lets sun rays reach the chancel.]]\nIn the 13th century BC, the earliest windows were unglazed openings in a roof to admit light during the day. Later,{{when|date=October 2016}} windows were covered with animal hide, cloth, or wood. [[Window shutter|Shutters]] that could be opened and closed came next.{{when|date=October 2016}} Over time, windows were built that both protected the inhabitants from the elements and transmitted light, using multiple small pieces of translucent material, such as flattened pieces of translucent animal horn, thin slices of [[marble]], for example [[fengite]], or pieces of glass, set in frameworks of wood, iron or lead. In the Far East, paper was used to fill windows.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/645175/window |title=Window\n|encyclopedia=Britannica|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\nThe Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt. Namely, in Alexandria ca. 100 AD cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical properties, began to appear, but these were small thick productions, little more than [[glass blowing|blown glass]] jars (cylindrical shapes) flattened out into sheets with circular striation patterns throughout. It would be over a millennium before a window glass became transparent enough to see through clearly, as we think of it now.\n\nOver the centuries techniques were developed to shear through one side of a blown glass [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] and produce thinner rectangular window panes from the same amount of glass material. This gave rise to tall narrow windows, usually separated by a vertical support called a mullion. [[Mullion]]ed glass windows were the windows of choice among [[Europe]]an well-to-do, whereas paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Andrew|title=Medieval Life|series=Eyewitness|year=2011|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=1-4053-4545-4|page=16}}</ref>\n\nModern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were perfected. Modern windows are usually filled with glass, although a few are transparent plastic.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n==Types==\n===Cross===\nA [[cross-window]] is a rectangular window usually divided into four lights by a mullion and transom that form a [[Latin cross]].<ref>Curl, James Stevens (2006). ''Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture'', 2nd ed., OUP, Oxford and New York, p. 214. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860678-9}}.</ref>\n\n===Eyebrow===\nThe term eyebrow window is used in two ways: a curved top window in a wall or in an eyebrow [[dormer]]; and a row of small windows usually under the front eaves such as the [[James-Lorah House]] in Pennsylvania.<ref>Harris, Cyril M.. ''American architecture: an illustrated encyclopedia''. New York: W.W. Norton, 1998. Print.</ref>\n\n===Fixed===\nA fixed window is a window that cannot be opened,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVTjAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA83&dq=Fixed+window+is+window+that+cannot+open&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF5Ma_5bvUAhUUH2MKHVJOC_UQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&q=Fixed%20window%20is%20window%20that%20cannot%20open&f=false|title=Kitchen & Bath Residential Construction and Systems|last=Association)|first=NKBA (National Kitchen and Bath|date=2013-10-29|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118711040|language=en}}</ref> whose function is limited to allowing light to enter (unlike an unfixed window, which can open and close). Clerestory windows in [[church architecture]] are often fixed. Transom windows may be fixed or operable. This type of window is used in situations where light or vision alone is needed as no ventilation is possible in such windows without the use of [[trickle vent]]s or overglass vents.\n\n===Single-hung sash===\nA single-hung sash window is a window that has one sash that is movable (usually the bottom one) and the other fixed. This is the earlier form of sliding sash window, and is also cheaper.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n===Double-hung sash===\nA [[sash window]] is the traditional style of window in the United Kingdom, and many other places that were formerly colonized by the UK, with two parts (sashes) that overlap slightly and slide up and down inside the frame. The two parts are not necessarily the same size; where the upper sash is smaller (shorter) it is termed a [[cottage window]]. Currently most new double-hung sash windows use spring balances to support the sashes, but traditionally, counterweights held in boxes on either side of the window were used. These were and are attached to the sashes using pulleys of either braided cord or, later, purpose-made chain. Three types of spring balances are called a tape or clock spring balance; channel or block-and-tackle balance; and a spiral or tube balance.\n\nDouble-hung sash windows were traditionally often fitted with [[Window shutter|shutters]]. Sash windows can be fitted with simplex hinges that let the window be locked into hinges on one side, while the rope on the other side is detached\u2014so the window can be opened for fire escape or cleaning.\n\n<br />\n===Foldup===\n[[File:Foldup window.gif|thumb|Foldup window (inward swinging)]]\nA foldup has two equal sashes similar to a standard double hung, but folds upward allowing air to pass through nearly the full frame opening. The window is balanced using either springs or counterbalances, similar to a double hung. The sashes can be either offset to simulate a double hung, or in-line. The inline versions can be made to fold inward or outward. The inward swinging foldup windows can have fixed screens, while the outward swinging ones require movable screens. The windows are typically used for screen rooms, kitchen pass-throughs, or for egress.\n\n===Horizontal sliding sash===\nA horizontal sliding sash window has two or more sashes that overlap slightly but slide horizontally within the frame. In the UK, these are sometimes called ''[[Yorkshire]]'' sash windows, presumably because of their traditional use in that county.\n\n===Casement===\n{{main|Casement window}}\n[[File:Gordijnen aan venster.JPG|thumb|[[Casement window]]]]\n\nA casement window is a window with a hinged sash that swings in or out like a door comprising either a side-hung, top-hung (also called \"awning window\"; see below), or occasionally bottom-hung sash or a combination of these types, sometimes with fixed panels on one or more sides of the sash.<ref name=\"Window\"/> In the USA, these are usually opened using a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]], but in parts of Europe they tend to use projection friction stays and [[espagnolette]] locking. Formerly, plain hinges were used with a [[casement stay]]. [[Handing]] applies to casement windows to determine direction of swing; a casement window may be left-handed, right-handed, or double. The casement window is the dominant type now found in modern buildings in the UK and many other parts of Europe.\n\n====Awning====\n[[File:Fen\u00eatre \u00e0 l'australienne - Awning window - (AWS Magnum 616) Light.jpg|thumb|upright|Awning window]]\nAn awning window is a casement window that is hung horizontally, [[hinge]]d on top, so that it swings outward like an [[awning]]. In addition to be used independently, they can be stacked, several in one opening, or combined with fixed glass. They are particularly useful for ventilation.<ref>{{cite book | title=Window Treatments | first=Karla J. | last=Nielson | page=45 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6U0uP5cyLQC&pg=PA45&dq=%22awning+window%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLgJCejrbLAhVU3mMKHWJmBJUQ6AEINTAA#v=onepage&q=%22awning%20window%22&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | date=Sep 15, 1989 | isbn=0471289469}}</ref>\n\n====Hopper====\nA hopper window is a bottom-pivoting casement window that opens by tilting vertically, typically to the inside.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Edward|last2=Thallon|first2=Rob|title=Fundamentals of Residential Construction|edition=3|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-54083-1|page=654}}</ref>\n\n===Pivot===\nA pivot window is a window hung on one hinge on each of two opposite sides which allows the window to revolve when opened. The hinges may be mounted top and bottom  (Vertically Pivoted) or at each jamb (Horizontally Pivoted). The window will usually open initially to a restricted position for ventilation and, once released, fully reverse and lock again for safe cleaning from inside. Modern pivot hinges incorporate a friction device to hold the window open against its own weight and may have restriction and reversed locking built in. In the UK, where this type of window is most common, they were extensively installed in high-rise social housing.\n\n===Tilt and slide===\nA tilt and slide window is a window (more usually a door-sized window) where the sash tilts inwards at the top and then slides horizontally behind the fixed pane.\n\n====Tilt and turn====\nA ''tilt and turn'' window can both tilt inwards at the top or open inwards from hinges at the side. This is the most common type of window in Germany, its country of origin. It is also widespread in many other European countries. In Europe it is usual for these to be of the \"turn first\" type. i.e. when the handle is turned to 90 degrees the window opens in the side hung mode. With the handle turned to 180 degrees the window opens in bottom hung mode. Most usually in the UK the windows will be \"tilt first\" i.e. bottom hung at 90 degrees for ventilation and side hung at 180 degrees for cleaning the outer face of the glass from inside the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windowanddoor.com/article/products/will-tilt-and-turn-windows-gain-market-share-north-america?page=0%2C1 |title=Will Tilt-and-Turn Windows Gain Market Share in North America? &#124; Window & Door |publisher=Windowanddoor.com |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Transom===\nA window above a door; in an exterior door the [[Transom (architectural)|''transom]] window is often fixed, in an interior door it can open either by hinges at top or bottom, or rotate on hinges. It provided ventilation before forced air heating and cooling. A fan-shaped transom is known as a fanlight, especially in the British Isles.\n\n===Side light===\nWindows beside a door or window are called ''side''-, ''wing''-, and ''margen-lights'' and ''flanking windows''.<ref>Curl, James Stevens. \"Flanking window\".

They are used extensively in tropical architecture. A jalousie door is a door with a jalousie window.\n\n[[File:Paris 12-22 (16249805806).jpg|thumb|[[Clerestory]] windows in the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] (Paris)]]\n\n===Clerestory===\n{{main|Clerestory}}\nA clerestory window is a window set in a [[roof]] structure or high in a wall, used for [[daylighting]].\n\n===Skylight===\n{{main|Daylighting}}\n[[File:BurlingtonHousePavementWindow.jpg|thumbnail|Sidewalk skylight (also named '[[pavement light]]') outside [[Burlington House]], [[London]]]]\n\nA skylight is a window built into a roof structure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TopgKO4x_2kC&pg=PA223&dq=skylight+is+window+built+into+roof&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigkYOY5rvUAhVK1GMKHSqJBt8Q6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&q=skylight%20is%20window%20built%20into%20roof&f=false|title=Construction Estimating Reference Data|last=Sarviel|first=Ed|date=1993|publisher=Craftsman Book Company|isbn=9780934041843|language=en}}</ref> This type of window allows for natural daylight and moonlight.\n\n===Roof===\n[[File:EdenProjectRoof.jpg|thumbnail|Hexagonal external cladding panels of roof in [[Eden Project]] Biomes ([[Cornwall]], England,)]]\nA sloped window used for [[daylighting]], built into a roof structure.

Sometimes includes an additional [[clerestory]]. May also be called a [[cupola]].\n\n===Bay===\n{{main|Bay window}}\nA bay window is a multi-panel window, with at least three panels set at different angles to create a protrusion from the wall line.<ref name=\"Window\"/>\n\n====Oriel====\n{{main|Oriel window}}\nThis form of bay window most often appears in Tudor-style houses and monasteries. It projects from the wall and does not extend to the ground. Originally a form of porch, they are often supported by brackets or corbels.\n\n===Thermal===\n{{main|Diocletian window}}\nThermal, or Diocletian, windows are large semicircular windows (or niches) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two mullions. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.\n\n===Picture===\nA picture window is a large fixed window in a wall, typically without glazing bars, or glazed with only perfunctory glazing bars ([[muntin]]s) near the edge of the window. Picture windows provide an unimpeded view, as if framing a picture.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/picture+window |title=Picture window |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-lite===\nA multi-lite window is a window glazed with small panes of glass separated by wooden or lead ''glazing bars'', or ''[[muntins]]'', arranged in a decorative ''glazing pattern'' often dictated by the building's architectural style. Due to the historic unavailability of large panes of glass, the multi-lit (or ''lattice window'') was the most common window style until the beginning of the 20th century, and is still used in traditional architecture.\n\n===Emergency exit/egress===\nAn emergency exit window is a window big enough and low enough so that occupants can escape through the opening in an emergency, such as a [[fire]]. In many countries, exact specifications for emergency windows in bedrooms are given in many [[building codes]]. Specifications for such windows may also allow for the entrance of emergency rescuers. Vehicles, such as [[bus]]es and [[aircraft]], frequently have emergency exit windows as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/documents/outreach/bus/PreTrip-SafetyBrochure-Pull.pdf |title=U.S. Dept. of Transportation: Safety information for bus/motorcoach passengers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Stained glass===\n[[File:Nasir-al molk -1.jpg|thumb|left|Sunlight shining through stained glass, [[Nasir-ol-molk Mosque]], [[Shiraz]], Iran]]\n{{main|stained glass}}\nA stained glass window is a window composed of pieces of colored glass, [[transparency (optics)|transparent, translucent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], frequently portraying persons or scenes.

Such windows provide a marked improvement in thermal insulation (and usually in acoustic insulation as well) and are resistant to fogging and frosting caused by temperature differential. They are widely used for residential and commercial construction in intemperate climates. Triple-paned windows have been commercially manufactured and marketed with claims of additional benefit but have not become common. In the UK double-paned and triple-paned are referred to as double-glazing and triple-glazing.\n\n===Hexagonal window===\n{{main|hexagonal window}}\n\nA hexagonal window is a hexagon-shaped window, resembling a bee cell or crystal lattice of graphite. The window can be vertically or horizontally oriented, openable or dead. It can also be regular or elongately-shaped and can have a separator ([[mullion]]). Typically, the cellular window is used for an attic or as a decorative feature, but it can also be a major architectural element to provide the natural lighting inside buildings.\n\n==Terms==\nEN 12519 is the European standard that describes windows terms officially used in EU Member States.\nThe main terms are:\n[[File:Casement (PSF).jpg|thumb|Casement window, with [[Latticework|latticed]] lights]]\n* '''Light''', or '''Lite''', is the area between the outer parts of a window ([[Transom (architectural)|transom]], sill and jambs), usually filled with a glass pane.

The terms ''single-light'', ''double-light'', etc., refer to the number of these glass panes in a window.\n* '''Sash unit''' is a window consisting of at least one sliding glass component, typically composed of two lites (known as a ''double-light'').\n* '''Replacement window''' in the United States means a framed window designed to slip inside the original window frame from the inside after the old sashes are removed. In Europe it usually means a complete window including a replacement outer frame.\n* '''New construction window''', in the US, means a window with a nailing fin that is inserted into a rough opening from the outside before applying siding and inside trim. A nailing fin is a projection on the outer frame of the window in the same plane as the [[glazing in architecture|glazing]], which overlaps the prepared opening, and can thus be 'nailed' into place.\n\n:In the UK and mainland Europe, windows in new-build houses are usually fixed with long screws into expanding plastic plugs in the brickwork.  A gap of up to 13 mm is left around all four sides, and filled with expanding [[polyurethane foam]].  This makes the window fixing weatherproof but allows for expansion due to heat.\n* '''[[Lintel]]''' is a beam over the top of a window, also known as a [[transom (architectural)|transom]].\n* '''[[Window sill]]''' is the bottom piece in a window frame. Window sills slant outward to drain water away from the inside of the building.\n* '''Secondary glazing''' is an additional frame applied to the inside of an existing frame, usually used on protected or listed buildings to achieve higher levels of thermal and sound insulation without compromising the look of the building\n* '''[[Millwork (building material)|Decorative millwork]]''' is the moulding, cornices and lintels often decorating the surrounding edges of the window.\n\n===Labeling===\nThe United States [[National Fenestration Rating Council|NFRC]] Window Label lists the following terms:\n* [[Thermal conductivity|Thermal transmittance (U-factor)]], best values are around U-0.15 (equal to 0.8 W/m2/K)\n* [[Solar heat gain coefficient]] (SHGC), ratio of solar heat (infrared) passing through the glass to incident solar heat\n* [[Visible transmittance]] (VT), ratio of transmitted visible light divided by incident visible light\n* [[airflow|Air leakage]] (AL), measured in cubic foot per minute per linear foot of crack between sash and frame\n* [[Damp (structural)#Condensation|Condensation resistance]] (CR), measured between 1 and 100 (the higher the number, the higher the resistance of the formation of condensation)<ref>[http://www.nfrc.org/documents/WindowsandHeatLoss.pdf Windows and Heat Loss], [[NFRC]] Heat Loss Fact Sheet</ref>\n\nThe European harmonised standard hEN 14351-1, which deals with doors and windows, defines 23 characteristics (divided into ''essential'' and ''non ''essential''.

In older windows, large panes of glass were quite expensive, so muntins let smaller panes fill a larger space. In modern windows, light-colored muntins still provide a useful function by reflecting some of the light going through the window, making the window itself a source of diffuse light (instead of just the surfaces and objects illuminated within the room).  By increasing the indirect illumination of surfaces near the window, muntins tend to brighten the area immediately around a window and reduce the contrast of shadows within the room.\n\n===Frame and sash construction===\n\nFrames and sashes can be made of the following materials:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because PVC is not as strong as other materials, some PVC frames are reinforced with metal or composite materials to improve their structural strength.\n:**Modern aluminium window frames are typically separated by a [[thermal break]] made of a glass fibre reinforced polyamide. With a 34&nbsp;mm thermal insulation profile it is possible to reach Uf= 1.3&nbsp;W/m\u00b2K for a metal window. This greatly increases thermal resistance, while retaining virtually all of the structural strength.\n\n[[composite material|Composites]] (also known as Hybrid Windows) are start since early 1998 and combine materials like aluminium + pvc or wood to obtain aesthetics of one material with the functional benefits of another.\n[[File:Bleekman zimmer.jpg|thumb|A typical installation of insulated glazing windows with uPVC window frames.]]\nA special class of PVC window frames, uPVC window frames, became widespread since the late 20th century, particularly in Europe: there were 83.5 million installed by 1998<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pritchard|first1=Geoffrey|title=Novel and Traditional Fillers for Plastics: Technology and Market Developments|year=1999|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|isbn=9781859571835|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3GWoyuMEckC&pg=PA95}}</ref> with numbers still growing as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/Vinyl_doors_market/vinyl_windows_market/prweb9415523.htm|title=Global Vinyl Windows Market to Reach 163 Million Units by 2017, According to a New Report by Global Industry Analysts, Inc. |publisher=PRWeb|date=April 18, 2012|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Glazing and filling===\n\n[[Low-emissivity]] coated panes reduce heat transfer by [[radiation]], which, depending on which surface is coated, helps prevent heat loss (in cold climates) or heat gains (in warm climates).\n\nHigh thermal resistance can be obtained by evacuating or filling the insulated glazing units with gases such as [[argon]] or [[krypton]], which reduces [[Heat conduction|conductive]] heat transfer due to their low thermal conductivity. Performance of such units depends on good window seals and meticulous frame construction to prevent entry of air and loss of efficiency.\n\nModern double-pane and triple-pane windows often include one or more low-e coatings to reduce the window's U-factor (its insulation value, specifically its rate of heat loss). In general, soft-coat low-e coatings tend to result in a lower solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) than hard-coat low-e coatings.\n\nModern windows are usually glazed with one large sheet of glass per sash, while windows in the past were glazed with multiple panes separated by ''glazing bars'', or ''muntins'', due to the unavailability of large sheets of glass. Today, glazing bars tend to be decorative, separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available, generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use. Glazing bars are typically wooden, but occasionally lead glazing bars soldered in place are used for more intricate glazing patterns.\n\n===Other construction details===\n\nMany windows have movable [[window covering]]s such as [[blinds]] or [[curtain]]s to keep out light, provide additional insulation, or ensure privacy.\nWindows allow natural light to enter, but too much can have negative effects such as glare and heat gain. Additionally, while windows let the user see outside, there must be a way to maintain privacy on in the inside.<ref name=\"Design Evaluation Project\">Howell, Sandra C. (1976).

Design Evaluation Project.</ref> Window coverings are practical accommodations for these issues.\n\n==Impact of the sun==\n{{main|Daylighting}}\n\n===Sun incidence angle===\n\nHistorically, windows are designed with surfaces parallel to vertical building walls.  Such a design allows considerable solar light and heat penetration due to the most commonly occurring incidence of sun angles. In [[passive solar building design]], an extended [[eave]] is typically used to control the amount of solar light and heat entering the window(s).\n\nAn alternative method is to calculate an optimum window mounting angle that accounts for summer sun load minimization, with consideration of actual latitude of the building. This process has been implemented, for example, in the [[Dakin Building]] in [[Brisbane, California]]\u2014in which most of the fenestration is designed to reflect summer heat load and help prevent summer interior [[over-illumination]] and glare, by canting windows to nearly a 45 degree angle.\n\n===Solar window===\n{{Main|Photovoltaics}}\n\nPhotovoltaic windows not only provide a clear view and illuminate rooms, but also convert sunlight to electricity for the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2008/mit-opens-new-window-solar-energy/|title=MIT opens new 'window' on solar energy |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref> In most cases, translucent photovoltaic cells are used.\n\n===Passive solar===\n\nPassive solar windows allow light and solar energy into a building while minimizing air leakage and heat loss. Properly positioning these windows in relation to sun, wind, and landscape\u2014while properly shading them to limit excess heat gain in summer and shoulder seasons, and providing thermal mass to absorb energy during the day and release it when temperatures cool at night\u2014increases comfort and energy efficiency. Properly designed in climates with adequate solar gain, these can even be a building's primary heating system.\n\n===Coverings===\n\nA [[window covering]] is a shade or screen that provides multiple functions. Some coverings, such as drapes and blinds provide occupants with privacy. Some window coverings control solar heat gain and glare. There are external shading devices and internal shading devices.<ref name=\"Windows\">Beckett, H. E., & Godfrey, J. A. (1974). ''Windows: Performance, design and installation''.

Modern windows are usually [[glazing (window)|glazed]] or covered in some other [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] or translucent material, a [[Window sash|sash]] set in a frame<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window.<ref name=\"Window\">{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/window/ |title=Window |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref> Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather. Windows often have a [[Latch (hardware)|latch]] or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.\n\nTypes include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, single-hung and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding [[sash window]]s, [[casement window]]s, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or [[louver]]ed windows, [[clerestory]] windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, emergency exit windows, [[stained glass]] windows, French windows, panel windows, and double - and triple paned windows.\n\nThe Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], in [[Alexandria]] ca. 100 AD. Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In [[England]], glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened [[animal horn]] were used as early as the 14th century. In the 19th century American west, [[greased paper window]]s came to be used by itinerant groups. Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were fully perfected.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English language-word ''window'' originates from the [[Old Norse]] 'vindauga', from 'vindr{{snd}} wind' and 'auga{{snd}} eye', i.e., ''wind eye''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com |title=New Oxford American Dictionary |date=2010}}</ref> In [[Norwegian Language|Norwegian]] [[Nynorsk]] and [[Icelandic Language|Icelandic]] the Old Norse form has survived to this day (in Icelandic only as a less used word for a type of small open \"window\", not strictly a synonym for ''gluggi'', the Icelandic word for window<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=71376|title=Hva\u00f0an kemur or\u00f0i\u00f0 gluggi? Af hverju notum vi\u00f0 ekki vindauga samanber window?|work=V\u00edsindavefurinn|access-date=2018-09-17|language=is}}</ref>), in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] the word ''vind\u00f6ga'' remains as a term for a hole through the roof of a hut, and in the Danish language 'vindue' and Norwegian [[Bokm\u00e5l]] 'vindu', the direct link to 'eye' is lost, just like for 'window'. The Danish (but not the Bokm\u00e5l) word is pronounced fairly similarly to ''window''.\n\n''Window'' is first recorded in the early 13th century, and originally referred to an unglazed hole in a roof. ''Window'' replaced the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''eag\u00feyrl'', which literally means 'eye-hole,' and 'eagduru' 'eye-door'. Many Germanic languages however adopted the Latin word 'fenestra' to describe a window with glass, such as [[Standard language|standard]] [[Swedish language|Swedish]] 'f\u00f6nster', or [[German language|German]] 'Fenster'. The use of ''window'' in English is probably because of the Scandinavian influence on the English language by means of [[loanwords]] during the [[Viking Age]].  In English the word ''fenester'' was used as a parallel until the mid-18th century. ''Fenestration'' is still used to describe the arrangement of windows within a [[fa\u00e7ade]], as well as ''[[defenestration]]'', meaning to throw something out of a window.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roman window glass.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a Roman window glass plate dated to 1st to 4th century A.D.<br />Note the obvious curvature; this is not a flat pane.]]\n[[File:MorellaSantaMariaWindow.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Alabaster]] \"mullion\"-divided decorative windows in Santa Maria La Major church ([[Morella, Castell\u00f3n|Morella]], Spain).]]\n[[File:ValenciaCathedral2.JPG|thumb|upright|Alabaster window in the [[Valencia Cathedral]]. Note the asymmetrical, slanted left side of the wall-frame, which lets sun rays reach the chancel.]]\nIn the 13th century BC, the earliest windows were unglazed openings in a roof to admit light during the day. Later,{{when|date=October 2016}} windows were covered with animal hide, cloth, or wood. [[Window shutter|Shutters]] that could be opened and closed came next.{{when|date=October 2016}} Over time, windows were built that both protected the inhabitants from the elements and transmitted light, using multiple small pieces of translucent material, such as flattened pieces of translucent animal horn, thin slices of [[marble]], for example [[fengite]], or pieces of glass, set in frameworks of wood, iron or lead. In the Far East, paper was used to fill windows.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/645175/window |title=Window\n|encyclopedia=Britannica|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\nThe Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt. Namely, in Alexandria ca. 100 AD cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical properties, began to appear, but these were small thick productions, little more than [[glass blowing|blown glass]] jars (cylindrical shapes) flattened out into sheets with circular striation patterns throughout. It would be over a millennium before a window glass became transparent enough to see through clearly, as we think of it now.\n\nOver the centuries techniques were developed to shear through one side of a blown glass [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] and produce thinner rectangular window panes from the same amount of glass material. This gave rise to tall narrow windows, usually separated by a vertical support called a mullion. [[Mullion]]ed glass windows were the windows of choice among [[Europe]]an well-to-do, whereas paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Andrew|title=Medieval Life|series=Eyewitness|year=2011|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=1-4053-4545-4|page=16}}</ref>\n\nModern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were perfected. Modern windows are usually filled with glass, although a few are transparent plastic.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n==Types==\n===Cross===\nA [[cross-window]] is a rectangular window usually divided into four lights by a mullion and transom that form a [[Latin cross]].<ref>Curl, James Stevens (2006). ''Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture'', 2nd ed., OUP, Oxford and New York, p. 214. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860678-9}}.</ref>\n\n===Eyebrow===\nThe term eyebrow window is used in two ways: a curved top window in a wall or in an eyebrow [[dormer]]; and a row of small windows usually under the front eaves such as the [[James-Lorah House]] in Pennsylvania.<ref>Harris, Cyril M.. ''American architecture: an illustrated encyclopedia''. New York: W.W. Norton, 1998. Print.</ref>\n\n===Fixed===\nA fixed window is a window that cannot be opened,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVTjAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA83&dq=Fixed+window+is+window+that+cannot+open&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF5Ma_5bvUAhUUH2MKHVJOC_UQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&q=Fixed%20window%20is%20window%20that%20cannot%20open&f=false|title=Kitchen & Bath Residential Construction and Systems|last=Association)|first=NKBA (National Kitchen and Bath|date=2013-10-29|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118711040|language=en}}</ref> whose function is limited to allowing light to enter (unlike an unfixed window, which can open and close). Clerestory windows in [[church architecture]] are often fixed. Transom windows may be fixed or operable. This type of window is used in situations where light or vision alone is needed as no ventilation is possible in such windows without the use of [[trickle vent]]s or overglass vents.\n\n===Single-hung sash===\nA single-hung sash window is a window that has one sash that is movable (usually the bottom one) and the other fixed. This is the earlier form of sliding sash window, and is also cheaper.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n===Double-hung sash===\nA [[sash window]] is the traditional style of window in the United Kingdom, and many other places that were formerly colonized by the UK, with two parts (sashes) that overlap slightly and slide up and down inside the frame. The two parts are not necessarily the same size; where the upper sash is smaller (shorter) it is termed a [[cottage window]]. Currently most new double-hung sash windows use spring balances to support the sashes, but traditionally, counterweights held in boxes on either side of the window were used. These were and are attached to the sashes using pulleys of either braided cord or, later, purpose-made chain. Three types of spring balances are called a tape or clock spring balance; channel or block-and-tackle balance; and a spiral or tube balance.\n\nDouble-hung sash windows were traditionally often fitted with [[Window shutter|shutters]]. Sash windows can be fitted with simplex hinges that let the window be locked into hinges on one side, while the rope on the other side is detached\u2014so the window can be opened for fire escape or cleaning.\n\n<br />\n===Foldup===\n[[File:Foldup window.gif|thumb|Foldup window (inward swinging)]]\nA foldup has two equal sashes similar to a standard double hung, but folds upward allowing air to pass through nearly the full frame opening. The window is balanced using either springs or counterbalances, similar to a double hung. The sashes can be either offset to simulate a double hung, or in-line. The inline versions can be made to fold inward or outward. The inward swinging foldup windows can have fixed screens, while the outward swinging ones require movable screens. The windows are typically used for screen rooms, kitchen pass-throughs, or for egress.\n\n===Horizontal sliding sash===\nA horizontal sliding sash window has two or more sashes that overlap slightly but slide horizontally within the frame. In the UK, these are sometimes called ''[[Yorkshire]]'' sash windows, presumably because of their traditional use in that county.\n\n===Casement===\n{{main|Casement window}}\n[[File:Gordijnen aan venster.JPG|thumb|[[Casement window]]]]\n\nA casement window is a window with a hinged sash that swings in or out like a door comprising either a side-hung, top-hung (also called \"awning window\"; see below), or occasionally bottom-hung sash or a combination of these types, sometimes with fixed panels on one or more sides of the sash.<ref name=\"Window\"/> In the USA, these are usually opened using a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]], but in parts of Europe they tend to use projection friction stays and [[espagnolette]] locking. Formerly, plain hinges were used with a [[casement stay]]. [[Handing]] applies to casement windows to determine direction of swing; a casement window may be left-handed, right-handed, or double. The casement window is the dominant type now found in modern buildings in the UK and many other parts of Europe.\n\n====Awning====\n[[File:Fen\u00eatre \u00e0 l'australienne - Awning window - (AWS Magnum 616) Light.jpg|thumb|upright|Awning window]]\nAn awning window is a casement window that is hung horizontally, [[hinge]]d on top, so that it swings outward like an [[awning]]. In addition to be used independently, they can be stacked, several in one opening, or combined with fixed glass. They are particularly useful for ventilation.<ref>{{cite book | title=Window Treatments | first=Karla J. | last=Nielson | page=45 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6U0uP5cyLQC&pg=PA45&dq=%22awning+window%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLgJCejrbLAhVU3mMKHWJmBJUQ6AEINTAA#v=onepage&q=%22awning%20window%22&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | date=Sep 15, 1989 | isbn=0471289469}}</ref>\n\n====Hopper====\nA hopper window is a bottom-pivoting casement window that opens by tilting vertically, typically to the inside.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Edward|last2=Thallon|first2=Rob|title=Fundamentals of Residential Construction|edition=3|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-54083-1|page=654}}</ref>\n\n===Pivot===\nA pivot window is a window hung on one hinge on each of two opposite sides which allows the window to revolve when opened. The hinges may be mounted top and bottom  (Vertically Pivoted) or at each jamb (Horizontally Pivoted). The window will usually open initially to a restricted position for ventilation and, once released, fully reverse and lock again for safe cleaning from inside. Modern pivot hinges incorporate a friction device to hold the window open against its own weight and may have restriction and reversed locking built in. In the UK, where this type of window is most common, they were extensively installed in high-rise social housing.\n\n===Tilt and slide===\nA tilt and slide window is a window (more usually a door-sized window) where the sash tilts inwards at the top and then slides horizontally behind the fixed pane.\n\n====Tilt and turn====\nA ''tilt and turn'' window can both tilt inwards at the top or open inwards from hinges at the side. This is the most common type of window in Germany, its country of origin. It is also widespread in many other European countries. In Europe it is usual for these to be of the \"turn first\" type. i.e. when the handle is turned to 90 degrees the window opens in the side hung mode. With the handle turned to 180 degrees the window opens in bottom hung mode. Most usually in the UK the windows will be \"tilt first\" i.e. bottom hung at 90 degrees for ventilation and side hung at 180 degrees for cleaning the outer face of the glass from inside the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windowanddoor.com/article/products/will-tilt-and-turn-windows-gain-market-share-north-america?page=0%2C1 |title=Will Tilt-and-Turn Windows Gain Market Share in North America? &#124; Window & Door |publisher=Windowanddoor.com |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Transom===\nA window above a door; in an exterior door the [[Transom (architectural)|''transom]] window is often fixed, in an interior door it can open either by hinges at top or bottom, or rotate on hinges. It provided ventilation before forced air heating and cooling. A fan-shaped transom is known as a fanlight, especially in the British Isles.\n\n===Side light===\nWindows beside a door or window are called ''side''-, ''wing''-, and ''margen-lights'' and ''flanking windows''.<ref>Curl, James Stevens. \"Flanking window\".

They are used extensively in tropical architecture. A jalousie door is a door with a jalousie window.\n\n[[File:Paris 12-22 (16249805806).jpg|thumb|[[Clerestory]] windows in the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] (Paris)]]\n\n===Clerestory===\n{{main|Clerestory}}\nA clerestory window is a window set in a [[roof]] structure or high in a wall, used for [[daylighting]].\n\n===Skylight===\n{{main|Daylighting}}\n[[File:BurlingtonHousePavementWindow.jpg|thumbnail|Sidewalk skylight (also named '[[pavement light]]') outside [[Burlington House]], [[London]]]]\n\nA skylight is a window built into a roof structure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TopgKO4x_2kC&pg=PA223&dq=skylight+is+window+built+into+roof&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigkYOY5rvUAhVK1GMKHSqJBt8Q6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&q=skylight%20is%20window%20built%20into%20roof&f=false|title=Construction Estimating Reference Data|last=Sarviel|first=Ed|date=1993|publisher=Craftsman Book Company|isbn=9780934041843|language=en}}</ref> This type of window allows for natural daylight and moonlight.\n\n===Roof===\n[[File:EdenProjectRoof.jpg|thumbnail|Hexagonal external cladding panels of roof in [[Eden Project]] Biomes ([[Cornwall]], England,)]]\nA sloped window used for [[daylighting]], built into a roof structure.

It projects from the wall and does not extend to the ground. Originally a form of porch, they are often supported by brackets or corbels.\n\n===Thermal===\n{{main|Diocletian window}}\nThermal, or Diocletian, windows are large semicircular windows (or niches) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two mullions. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.\n\n===Picture===\nA picture window is a large fixed window in a wall, typically without glazing bars, or glazed with only perfunctory glazing bars ([[muntin]]s) near the edge of the window. Picture windows provide an unimpeded view, as if framing a picture.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/picture+window |title=Picture window |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-lite===\nA multi-lite window is a window glazed with small panes of glass separated by wooden or lead ''glazing bars'', or ''[[muntins]]'', arranged in a decorative ''glazing pattern'' often dictated by the building's architectural style. Due to the historic unavailability of large panes of glass, the multi-lit (or ''lattice window'') was the most common window style until the beginning of the 20th century, and is still used in traditional architecture.\n\n===Emergency exit/egress===\nAn emergency exit window is a window big enough and low enough so that occupants can escape through the opening in an emergency, such as a [[fire]]. In many countries, exact specifications for emergency windows in bedrooms are given in many [[building codes]]. Specifications for such windows may also allow for the entrance of emergency rescuers. Vehicles, such as [[bus]]es and [[aircraft]], frequently have emergency exit windows as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/documents/outreach/bus/PreTrip-SafetyBrochure-Pull.pdf |title=U.S. Dept. of Transportation: Safety information for bus/motorcoach passengers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Stained glass===\n[[File:Nasir-al molk -1.jpg|thumb|left|Sunlight shining through stained glass, [[Nasir-ol-molk Mosque]], [[Shiraz]], Iran]]\n{{main|stained glass}}\nA stained glass window is a window composed of pieces of colored glass, [[transparency (optics)|transparent, translucent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], frequently portraying persons or scenes.

Such windows provide a marked improvement in thermal insulation (and usually in acoustic insulation as well) and are resistant to fogging and frosting caused by temperature differential. They are widely used for residential and commercial construction in intemperate climates. Triple-paned windows have been commercially manufactured and marketed with claims of additional benefit but have not become common. In the UK double-paned and triple-paned are referred to as double-glazing and triple-glazing.\n\n===Hexagonal window===\n{{main|hexagonal window}}\n\nA hexagonal window is a hexagon-shaped window, resembling a bee cell or crystal lattice of graphite. The window can be vertically or horizontally oriented, openable or dead. It can also be regular or elongately-shaped and can have a separator ([[mullion]]). Typically, the cellular window is used for an attic or as a decorative feature, but it can also be a major architectural element to provide the natural lighting inside buildings.\n\n==Terms==\nEN 12519 is the European standard that describes windows terms officially used in EU Member States.\nThe main terms are:\n[[File:Casement (PSF).jpg|thumb|Casement window, with [[Latticework|latticed]] lights]]\n* '''Light''', or '''Lite''', is the area between the outer parts of a window ([[Transom (architectural)|transom]], sill and jambs), usually filled with a glass pane.

The terms ''single-light'', ''double-light'', etc., refer to the number of these glass panes in a window.\n* '''Sash unit''' is a window consisting of at least one sliding glass component, typically composed of two lites (known as a ''double-light'').\n* '''Replacement window''' in the United States means a framed window designed to slip inside the original window frame from the inside after the old sashes are removed. In Europe it usually means a complete window including a replacement outer frame.\n* '''New construction window''', in the US, means a window with a nailing fin that is inserted into a rough opening from the outside before applying siding and inside trim. A nailing fin is a projection on the outer frame of the window in the same plane as the [[glazing in architecture|glazing]], which overlaps the prepared opening, and can thus be 'nailed' into place.\n\n:In the UK and mainland Europe, windows in new-build houses are usually fixed with long screws into expanding plastic plugs in the brickwork.  A gap of up to 13 mm is left around all four sides, and filled with expanding [[polyurethane foam]].  This makes the window fixing weatherproof but allows for expansion due to heat.\n* '''[[Lintel]]''' is a beam over the top of a window, also known as a [[transom (architectural)|transom]].\n* '''[[Window sill]]''' is the bottom piece in a window frame. Window sills slant outward to drain water away from the inside of the building.\n* '''Secondary glazing''' is an additional frame applied to the inside of an existing frame, usually used on protected or listed buildings to achieve higher levels of thermal and sound insulation without compromising the look of the building\n* '''[[Millwork (building material)|Decorative millwork]]''' is the moulding, cornices and lintels often decorating the surrounding edges of the window.\n\n===Labeling===\nThe United States [[National Fenestration Rating Council|NFRC]] Window Label lists the following terms:\n* [[Thermal conductivity|Thermal transmittance (U-factor)]], best values are around U-0.15 (equal to 0.8 W/m2/K)\n* [[Solar heat gain coefficient]] (SHGC), ratio of solar heat (infrared) passing through the glass to incident solar heat\n* [[Visible transmittance]] (VT), ratio of transmitted visible light divided by incident visible light\n* [[airflow|Air leakage]] (AL), measured in cubic foot per minute per linear foot of crack between sash and frame\n* [[Damp (structural)#Condensation|Condensation resistance]] (CR), measured between 1 and 100 (the higher the number, the higher the resistance of the formation of condensation)<ref>[http://www.nfrc.org/documents/WindowsandHeatLoss.pdf Windows and Heat Loss], [[NFRC]] Heat Loss Fact Sheet</ref>\n\nThe European harmonised standard hEN 14351-1, which deals with doors and windows, defines 23 characteristics (divided into ''essential'' and ''non ''essential''.

Norton & Company, Inc.</ref>  Therefore, [[Insulated glazing|insulated glazing units]] consist of two or more panes to reduce the transfer of heat.\n\n===Grids or muntins===\n\nThese are the pieces of framing that separate a larger window into smaller panes.  In older windows, large panes of glass were quite expensive, so muntins let smaller panes fill a larger space. In modern windows, light-colored muntins still provide a useful function by reflecting some of the light going through the window, making the window itself a source of diffuse light (instead of just the surfaces and objects illuminated within the room).  By increasing the indirect illumination of surfaces near the window, muntins tend to brighten the area immediately around a window and reduce the contrast of shadows within the room.\n\n===Frame and sash construction===\n\nFrames and sashes can be made of the following materials:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because PVC is not as strong as other materials, some PVC frames are reinforced with metal or composite materials to improve their structural strength.\n:**Modern aluminium window frames are typically separated by a [[thermal break]] made of a glass fibre reinforced polyamide. With a 34&nbsp;mm thermal insulation profile it is possible to reach Uf= 1.3&nbsp;W/m\u00b2K for a metal window. This greatly increases thermal resistance, while retaining virtually all of the structural strength.\n\n[[composite material|Composites]] (also known as Hybrid Windows) are start since early 1998 and combine materials like aluminium + pvc or wood to obtain aesthetics of one material with the functional benefits of another.\n[[File:Bleekman zimmer.jpg|thumb|A typical installation of insulated glazing windows with uPVC window frames.]]\nA special class of PVC window frames, uPVC window frames, became widespread since the late 20th century, particularly in Europe: there were 83.5 million installed by 1998<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pritchard|first1=Geoffrey|title=Novel and Traditional Fillers for Plastics: Technology and Market Developments|year=1999|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|isbn=9781859571835|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3GWoyuMEckC&pg=PA95}}</ref> with numbers still growing as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/Vinyl_doors_market/vinyl_windows_market/prweb9415523.htm|title=Global Vinyl Windows Market to Reach 163 Million Units by 2017, According to a New Report by Global Industry Analysts, Inc. |publisher=PRWeb|date=April 18, 2012|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Glazing and filling===\n\n[[Low-emissivity]] coated panes reduce heat transfer by [[radiation]], which, depending on which surface is coated, helps prevent heat loss (in cold climates) or heat gains (in warm climates).\n\nHigh thermal resistance can be obtained by evacuating or filling the insulated glazing units with gases such as [[argon]] or [[krypton]], which reduces [[Heat conduction|conductive]] heat transfer due to their low thermal conductivity. Performance of such units depends on good window seals and meticulous frame construction to prevent entry of air and loss of efficiency.\n\nModern double-pane and triple-pane windows often include one or more low-e coatings to reduce the window's U-factor (its insulation value, specifically its rate of heat loss). In general, soft-coat low-e coatings tend to result in a lower solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) than hard-coat low-e coatings.\n\nModern windows are usually glazed with one large sheet of glass per sash, while windows in the past were glazed with multiple panes separated by ''glazing bars'', or ''muntins'', due to the unavailability of large sheets of glass. Today, glazing bars tend to be decorative, separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available, generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use. Glazing bars are typically wooden, but occasionally lead glazing bars soldered in place are used for more intricate glazing patterns.\n\n===Other construction details===\n\nMany windows have movable [[window covering]]s such as [[blinds]] or [[curtain]]s to keep out light, provide additional insulation, or ensure privacy.\nWindows allow natural light to enter, but too much can have negative effects such as glare and heat gain. Additionally, while windows let the user see outside, there must be a way to maintain privacy on in the inside.<ref name=\"Design Evaluation Project\">Howell, Sandra C. (1976). ''Designing for the Elderly; Windows''. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Department of Architecture. Design Evaluation Project.</ref> Window coverings are practical accommodations for these issues.\n\n==Impact of the sun==\n{{main|Daylighting}}\n\n===Sun incidence angle===\n\nHistorically, windows are designed with surfaces parallel to vertical building walls.  Such a design allows considerable solar light and heat penetration due to the most commonly occurring incidence of sun angles. In [[passive solar building design]], an extended [[eave]] is typically used to control the amount of solar light and heat entering the window(s).\n\nAn alternative method is to calculate an optimum window mounting angle that accounts for summer sun load minimization, with consideration of actual latitude of the building. This process has been implemented, for example, in the [[Dakin Building]] in [[Brisbane, California]]\u2014in which most of the fenestration is designed to reflect summer heat load and help prevent summer interior [[over-illumination]] and glare, by canting windows to nearly a 45 degree angle.\n\n===Solar window===\n{{Main|Photovoltaics}}\n\nPhotovoltaic windows not only provide a clear view and illuminate rooms, but also convert sunlight to electricity for the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2008/mit-opens-new-window-solar-energy/|title=MIT opens new 'window' on solar energy |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref> In most cases, translucent photovoltaic cells are used.\n\n===Passive solar===\n\nPassive solar windows allow light and solar energy into a building while minimizing air leakage and heat loss. Properly positioning these windows in relation to sun, wind, and landscape\u2014while properly shading them to limit excess heat gain in summer and shoulder seasons, and providing thermal mass to absorb energy during the day and release it when temperatures cool at night\u2014increases comfort and energy efficiency. Properly designed in climates with adequate solar gain, these can even be a building's primary heating system.\n\n===Coverings===\n\nA [[window covering]] is a shade or screen that provides multiple functions. Some coverings, such as drapes and blinds provide occupants with privacy. Some window coverings control solar heat gain and glare. There are external shading devices and internal shading devices.<ref name=\"Windows\">Beckett, H. E., & Godfrey, J. A. (1974). ''Windows: Performance, design and installation''.

The bangar tree is notable for the foul odor that emanates from its flowers.\n\n===Barangay names===\n* ''Agdeppa'' &ndash; Notorious criminals were once often executed with their arms outstretched, and the place was thus called ''agdeppa'', meaning outstretched arms.\n* ''Alzate'' &ndash; Named after a Spanish colonial officer called General Alzate, who manned the garrison in that place against the local ''revolucionarios''. It is said that the [[Amburayan River]] which partly flowed through Bangar was a favourite swimming hole for Spaniards and the early ''illustrados''.\n* ''Bangaoilan'' &ndash; Once called \"Anonang\", the town was renamed because of the abundance of a poisonous plant called ''bangaoil''.\n* ''Barraca'' &ndash; This ''barrio'' was formed from the two ''sitio'' of Binyadura and Nagpalcan. Barraca was adopted as the common name after residents of both hamlets signed a pact to end a violent feud.\n* ''Cadapli'' &ndash; This was taken from the [[Ilocano language|Ilokano]] words ''cadcadapa'' (\"crawling\") and ''apli'' (\"mat\"). This name was adopted after several robbers hiding in the forests near this barrio were caught whilst sleeping on straw mats (''apli''). They were then severely [[flogging|flogged]] and punished until they were left crawling (''cadapa'').\n* ''Caggao'' &ndash; Named after a parasite called ''cagaw'', which once infested the place.\n* ''Luzong'' &ndash; This place was formerly three ''sitio'': Pideng, Butak and Dalimuno. [[Quicksand]] in the area caused the disappearance of [[working animal]]s, hence the name \"Luzong\", derived from the Ilocano word ''lusong'' (\"stuck\").\n* ''Mar\u00eda Cristina'' &ndash; It is said that a visiting [[American people|American]] once asked the village's name from a beautiful girl. Thinking that the stranger was asking for ''her'' name, the maiden answered \"Mar\u00eda Cristina\".\n* ''Mindoro'' &ndash; The name was derived from the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] ''Minas de oro'' (\"gold mine\"). At that time there were gold dust and nuggets in the river beside the village, and people used to pan these and sell them to the rich. General Alzate gave the village its present name.\n* ''Nagsabaran'' &ndash; This name (meaning \"place where [the road] branches out\") was given to the place because the national road branched out to this barrio. \n* ''Paratong'' &ndash; The old name was Libtong, which means \"lagoon\". During the Spanish Era, the prefix \"lib\" was changed into \"para\" which literally means \"for\".\n* ''Quintarong'' &ndash; Once named ''Daya ti Sabangan'' (\"east of the mouth of the river\"), the place was a reputed hideout of native pirates called ''tirong'' whom villagers often saw running after one another (''kinnamat'' in Ilocano).\n* ''Reyna Regente'' &ndash; The village was named after a certain [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Colonial]] queen who once ruled the area. Called Reyna Regente by later generations, it is said that she was ruthless. Her unnamed youngest daughter succeeded her, and unlike her mother was a wise and benevolent monarch.\n* ''Rissing'' &ndash; The old name ''Pa-o'' was taken from a big tree in the area; when and how it became Rissing is unknown.\n* ''San Blas'' &ndash; The place was named after a man who was reputedly known for his wisdom and was named after [[Saint Blaise]].\n* ''San Cristobal'' &ndash; Named after the town's [[patron saint]], [[Saint Christopher]].\n* ''Sinapangan'' &ndash; Named after the ''sapang'' tree which grew abundantly in the place.\n* ''Ubbog'' &ndash; The term ''ubbog'' means \"spring\". Long ago, water would well up through the earth even with little effort.\n\n==Geography==\nThe northernmost town of La Union, alongside Sudipen, Bangar is also the smallest municipality in the province with an area of {{convert|3736|ha}}.{{PSGC detail|area}} It is bounded by the [[South China Sea]] to the west, [[Sudipen, La Union|Sudipen]] to the east, and [[Balaoan, La Union|Balaoan]] and [[Luna, La Union|Luna]] to the south-west. The [[Amburayan River]] flows to the north of Bangar, separating it from [[Tagudin, Ilocos Sur]].\n\nBangar is {{convert|307|km}} from [[Metro Manila]] and {{convert|38|km}} from [[San Fernando, La Union|San Fernando]], the provincial capital.\n\n===Barangays===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Agdeppa\n* Alzate\n* Bangaoilan East\n* Bangaoilan West\n* Barraca\n* Cadapli\n* Caggao\n* Central East No. 1 (''Poblacion'')\n* Central East No. 2 (''Poblacion'')\n* Central West No. 1 (''Poblacion'')\n* Central West No. 2 (''Poblacion'')\n* Central West No. 3 (''Poblacion'')\n* Consuegra\n* General Prim East\n* General Prim West\n* General Terrero\n* Luzong Norte\n* Luzong Sur\n* Maria Cristina East\n* Maria Cristina West\n* Mindoro\n* Nagsabaran\n* Paratong No. 3\n* Paratong No. 4\n* Paratong Norte\n* Quintarong\n* Reyna Regente\n* Rissing\n* San Blas\n* San Cristobal\n* Sinapangan Norte\n* Sinapangan Sur\n* Ubbog\n{{div col end}}\n\n==History==\n1700 marked the official foundation of Bangar under the patronage of Saint Christopher, when it became a mission field. However, Christianity was brought as early as the later part of 1500, when Bangar was still a ''visita'' ([[chapelry]]) of Tagudin, with a community of 2,800 inhabitants. The highly skilled, industrious and peace-loving people were primarily engaged in rice and cotton planting. The beautiful and sturdy handwoven products made by the women of that time even found their way to Europe and it was said that some of these materials were used as boat sails by European seamen. Among the more famous handwoven products made by them were blankets bearing different designs, clothing materials and mosquito nets. Since chemicals for coloring were very scarce those days, the bark of trees and fruit were used to dye those handwoven products.\n\nThe old town was made of three ''pueblitos'' (small towns) namely: Villa-Cruz, San Rafael and San Anastacio. Near these pueblitos were small communities of ''Igorotes Infieles'' who paid tribute to the Governor.\n\nThrough the ''Superior Decreto'' (Executive Decree) signed by Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco on March 2, 1850, the town of Bangar was made part of the newly created province of La Union. Prior to this, Bangar, Purao (Balaoan) and Namacpacan (Luna) were part of Ilocos Sur. As the years passed by, barrios were formed.\n\nEducation during Spanish times consisted of learning the ''Cartilla'' and the ''abecedario''. Roman Catholic religion was taught hand-in-hand with good manners. However, formal education was given to students belonging to the upper class. Spanish social life had greatly affected the ''Indios'' and in no time, Castilian manners were very evident among them.\n\nThe social class of an individual was easily distinguished by the kind of attire one wore. Male peasants were distinguished by their simple ''camisa de chino'' and loose pants tied to the waist by braided strings. Female peasants wore simple loose blouses and ankle length skirts, with a ''camison'', made from cotton fabric, worn underneath. The peasantry were usually barefooted, and if there was anything worn on the feet, it was the ''kammadang'' (wooden shoes) or a pair of slippers.\n\nMen of the upper class were distinguished by the ''barong'' and ''camisa de chino'' made of fine fabric, and trousers cut in the western style. He wore socks and leather shoes and on the head was a hat, which was usually plumed. A walking cane in various styles and colors and encased in gold, silver or bronze was indispensable. He never smoked without using a pipe.\n\nThe upper class lady was very fastidious. She had her hair done in a brushed up coiffure. They curled their hair by using the stem of the papaya leaf and iron rod which was heated over burning charcoal. However, so much care was given using this method. Other women preferred to tie their hair in curls in the evening and untie it in the morning. Ladies wore the \"Maria Clara\" or the ''camisa'' with embroidered and stitched butterfly sleeves and matching ''panuelo''. They used ''alfiler'' (pins) made of gold or silver. A comb called ''peineta'', usually fan-shaped and encrusted with silver or gold, adorned their hair. The skirt, which was usually billowy, was made from very fine fabric from China. Underneath she wore a long ''camison'' and over it the ''nuagas''. The outer skirt was still topped by beautiful imported lace. A perfumed fan and a big handkerchief trimmed with lace, hanging on the right side of the skirt tucked to her waistline, was part of the attire. On Sundays and holidays of obligation, a ''mantilla'' made of lace, which covered the head down to the waist and tucked to the hair by a gold pin was obligatory for the Holy Mass. On the feet, the lady wore a ''zapatilla'', usually half-heeled and adorned with artificial rhinestones. A gold pendant hanging from a gold necklace around the neck was also part of the attire. The ''tamborine'', a gold necklace with intricate designs was also worn on special days.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n[[US]]-styled education was implemented with the coming of the Americans in 1898. Education had a very high standard then, such that one who finished the fourth grade could teach those who were in the lower years.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe impact of World War II was first felt in Bangar on December 8, 1941, the feast of the Immaculate Conception. A lantern competition, which was sponsored by Rev. Jose Brillantes, the parish priest, was hastily cancelled and church goers had to hurry home after the Holy Mass as they immediately prepared for evacuation. On December 20, 1941, the Japanese Army entered Bangar. They put up sentries along the national road and also had one at the Municipal building and another at the plaza. The Japanese occupation required all citizens to display and pin small Japanese flags outside the pocket of the shirt or blouse with the name of the holder written in Japanese. According to them, this was to distinguished peaceful citizens from guerrillas.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nSometime in 1944, on the day Bangar was celebrating the birthday of Emperor Hirohito with a program at the town plaza, a truck load of Japanese soldiers arrived with a lone Filipino who was said to have been captured somewhere in Bacnotan. It was told that the Japanese took the Filipino behind the southern school building and ordered him to dig what was to be his own grave. Upon sensing that his hours on earth were counted, the Filipino suddenly grabbed and unsheathed the sword of an officer who was standing nearby and in one hit motion with the sword, the officer almost got beheaded. This stunned the Japanese soldiers and the Filipino was able to escape unhurt. The whole town was gripped in terror, since this would mean Japanese reprisals&mdash;on December 28, 1944, the Japanese burned many houses in the town proper and raided the camp of the guerrillas in barrio San Cristobal.\n\nThe Underground Movement was very strong during the Japanese occupation of Bangar. Many residents joined the guerrillas, who had put up camps in San Cristobal. Further in the mountains at Lonoy, they also joined \"Camp 121\". Colonel Volkman and Major Agtarap led the guerrilla movement. The arms that were supplied to the guerrillas landed at Paraoir and men had to carry [[Bolo knife|bolo]]s at nighttime.\n\nThe first Americans to reach Bangar during its liberation were a certain Captain Roberts with his men.\n\nDuring the Northern Luzon Campaign, Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and units of the 1st, 2nd, 12th, 13th, 15th and 16th Infantry Divisions and the USAFIP-NL 121st Infantry Regiment started the liberation campaign in Bangar in 1945 and helped guerrilla resistance fighters and the U.S. liberation forces against Japanese Imperial Army forces towards the end of the war.{{elucidate|date=October 2016}}\n\nToday, Bangar is known for its handwoven cloth called ''abel'' and blacksmithing (''panday'').

The bangar tree is notable for the foul odor that emanates from its flowers.\n\n===Barangay names===\n* ''Agdeppa'' &ndash; Notorious criminals were once often executed with their arms outstretched, and the place was thus called ''agdeppa'', meaning outstretched arms.\n* ''Alzate'' &ndash; Named after a Spanish colonial officer called General Alzate, who manned the garrison in that place against the local ''revolucionarios''. It is said that the [[Amburayan River]] which partly flowed through Bangar was a favourite swimming hole for Spaniards and the early ''illustrados''.\n* ''Bangaoilan'' &ndash; Once called \"Anonang\", the town was renamed because of the abundance of a poisonous plant called ''bangaoil''.\n* ''Barraca'' &ndash; This ''barrio'' was formed from the two ''sitio'' of Binyadura and Nagpalcan. Barraca was adopted as the common name after residents of both hamlets signed a pact to end a violent feud.\n* ''Cadapli'' &ndash; This was taken from the [[Ilocano language|Ilokano]] words ''cadcadapa'' (\"crawling\") and ''apli'' (\"mat\"). This name was adopted after several robbers hiding in the forests near this barrio were caught whilst sleeping on straw mats (''apli''). They were then severely [[flogging|flogged]] and punished until they were left crawling (''cadapa'').\n* ''Caggao'' &ndash; Named after a parasite called ''cagaw'', which once infested the place.\n* ''Luzong'' &ndash; This place was formerly three ''sitio'': Pideng, Butak and Dalimuno. [[Quicksand]] in the area caused the disappearance of [[working animal]]s, hence the name \"Luzong\", derived from the Ilocano word ''lusong'' (\"stuck\").\n* ''Mar\u00eda Cristina'' &ndash; It is said that a visiting [[American people|American]] once asked the village's name from a beautiful girl. Thinking that the stranger was asking for ''her'' name, the maiden answered \"Mar\u00eda Cristina\".\n* ''Mindoro'' &ndash; The name was derived from the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] ''Minas de oro'' (\"gold mine\"). At that time there were gold dust and nuggets in the river beside the village, and people used to pan these and sell them to the rich. General Alzate gave the village its present name.\n* ''Nagsabaran'' &ndash; This name (meaning \"place where [the road] branches out\") was given to the place because the national road branched out to this barrio. \n* ''Paratong'' &ndash; The old name was Libtong, which means \"lagoon\". During the Spanish Era, the prefix \"lib\" was changed into \"para\" which literally means \"for\".\n* ''Quintarong'' &ndash; Once named ''Daya ti Sabangan'' (\"east of the mouth of the river\"), the place was a reputed hideout of native pirates called ''tirong'' whom villagers often saw running after one another (''kinnamat'' in Ilocano).\n* ''Reyna Regente'' &ndash; The village was named after a certain [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Colonial]] queen who once ruled the area. Called Reyna Regente by later generations, it is said that she was ruthless. Her unnamed youngest daughter succeeded her, and unlike her mother was a wise and benevolent monarch.\n* ''Rissing'' &ndash; The old name ''Pa-o'' was taken from a big tree in the area; when and how it became Rissing is unknown.\n* ''San Blas'' &ndash; The place was named after a man who was reputedly known for his wisdom and was named after [[Saint Blaise]].\n* ''San Cristobal'' &ndash; Named after the town's [[patron saint]], [[Saint Christopher]].\n* ''Sinapangan'' &ndash; Named after the ''sapang'' tree which grew abundantly in the place.\n* ''Ubbog'' &ndash; The term ''ubbog'' means \"spring\". Long ago, water would well up through the earth even with little effort.\n\n==Geography==\nThe northernmost town of La Union, alongside Sudipen, Bangar is also the smallest municipality in the province with an area of {{convert|3736|ha}}.{{PSGC detail|area}} It is bounded by the [[South China Sea]] to the west, [[Sudipen, La Union|Sudipen]] to the east, and [[Balaoan, La Union|Balaoan]] and [[Luna, La Union|Luna]] to the south-west.

However, Christianity was brought as early as the later part of 1500, when Bangar was still a ''visita'' ([[chapelry]]) of Tagudin, with a community of 2,800 inhabitants. The highly skilled, industrious and peace-loving people were primarily engaged in rice and cotton planting. The beautiful and sturdy handwoven products made by the women of that time even found their way to Europe and it was said that some of these materials were used as boat sails by European seamen. Among the more famous handwoven products made by them were blankets bearing different designs, clothing materials and mosquito nets. Since chemicals for coloring were very scarce those days, the bark of trees and fruit were used to dye those handwoven products.\n\nThe old town was made of three ''pueblitos'' (small towns) namely: Villa-Cruz, San Rafael and San Anastacio. Near these pueblitos were small communities of ''Igorotes Infieles'' who paid tribute to the Governor.\n\nThrough the ''Superior Decreto'' (Executive Decree) signed by Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco on March 2, 1850, the town of Bangar was made part of the newly created province of La Union. Prior to this, Bangar, Purao (Balaoan) and Namacpacan (Luna) were part of Ilocos Sur. As the years passed by, barrios were formed.\n\nEducation during Spanish times consisted of learning the ''Cartilla'' and the ''abecedario''. Roman Catholic religion was taught hand-in-hand with good manners. However, formal education was given to students belonging to the upper class. Spanish social life had greatly affected the ''Indios'' and in no time, Castilian manners were very evident among them.\n\nThe social class of an individual was easily distinguished by the kind of attire one wore. Male peasants were distinguished by their simple ''camisa de chino'' and loose pants tied to the waist by braided strings. Female peasants wore simple loose blouses and ankle length skirts, with a ''camison'', made from cotton fabric, worn underneath. The peasantry were usually barefooted, and if there was anything worn on the feet, it was the ''kammadang'' (wooden shoes) or a pair of slippers.\n\nMen of the upper class were distinguished by the ''barong'' and ''camisa de chino'' made of fine fabric, and trousers cut in the western style. He wore socks and leather shoes and on the head was a hat, which was usually plumed. A walking cane in various styles and colors and encased in gold, silver or bronze was indispensable. He never smoked without using a pipe.\n\nThe upper class lady was very fastidious. She had her hair done in a brushed up coiffure. They curled their hair by using the stem of the papaya leaf and iron rod which was heated over burning charcoal. However, so much care was given using this method. Other women preferred to tie their hair in curls in the evening and untie it in the morning. Ladies wore the \"Maria Clara\" or the ''camisa'' with embroidered and stitched butterfly sleeves and matching ''panuelo''. They used ''alfiler'' (pins) made of gold or silver. A comb called ''peineta'', usually fan-shaped and encrusted with silver or gold, adorned their hair. The skirt, which was usually billowy, was made from very fine fabric from China. Underneath she wore a long ''camison'' and over it the ''nuagas''. The outer skirt was still topped by beautiful imported lace. A perfumed fan and a big handkerchief trimmed with lace, hanging on the right side of the skirt tucked to her waistline, was part of the attire. On Sundays and holidays of obligation, a ''mantilla'' made of lace, which covered the head down to the waist and tucked to the hair by a gold pin was obligatory for the Holy Mass. On the feet, the lady wore a ''zapatilla'', usually half-heeled and adorned with artificial rhinestones. A gold pendant hanging from a gold necklace around the neck was also part of the attire. The ''tamborine'', a gold necklace with intricate designs was also worn on special days.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n[[US]]-styled education was implemented with the coming of the Americans in 1898. Education had a very high standard then, such that one who finished the fourth grade could teach those who were in the lower years.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe impact of World War II was first felt in Bangar on December 8, 1941, the feast of the Immaculate Conception. A lantern competition, which was sponsored by Rev. Jose Brillantes, the parish priest, was hastily cancelled and church goers had to hurry home after the Holy Mass as they immediately prepared for evacuation. On December 20, 1941, the Japanese Army entered Bangar. They put up sentries along the national road and also had one at the Municipal building and another at the plaza. The Japanese occupation required all citizens to display and pin small Japanese flags outside the pocket of the shirt or blouse with the name of the holder written in Japanese. According to them, this was to distinguished peaceful citizens from guerrillas.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nSometime in 1944, on the day Bangar was celebrating the birthday of Emperor Hirohito with a program at the town plaza, a truck load of Japanese soldiers arrived with a lone Filipino who was said to have been captured somewhere in Bacnotan. It was told that the Japanese took the Filipino behind the southern school building and ordered him to dig what was to be his own grave. Upon sensing that his hours on earth were counted, the Filipino suddenly grabbed and unsheathed the sword of an officer who was standing nearby and in one hit motion with the sword, the officer almost got beheaded. This stunned the Japanese soldiers and the Filipino was able to escape unhurt. The whole town was gripped in terror, since this would mean Japanese reprisals&mdash;on December 28, 1944, the Japanese burned many houses in the town proper and raided the camp of the guerrillas in barrio San Cristobal.\n\nThe Underground Movement was very strong during the Japanese occupation of Bangar. Many residents joined the guerrillas, who had put up camps in San Cristobal. Further in the mountains at Lonoy, they also joined \"Camp 121\". Colonel Volkman and Major Agtarap led the guerrilla movement.
