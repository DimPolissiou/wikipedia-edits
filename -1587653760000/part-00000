Drafted into military service, he distinguished himself, becoming the youngest [[sergeant major]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] of that time. After being seriously wounded and captured by the Imperial Russians during [[World War I]], he was sent to a work camp in the [[Ural Mountains]]. He participated in some events of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and the subsequent [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]]. \n\nUpon his return to the Balkans in 1918, Broz entered the newly established [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], where he joined the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ). He later was elected as General Secretary (later Chairman of the Presidium) of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (1939\u20131980). During [[World War II]], after the Nazi invasion of the area, he led the Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] (1941\u20131945).<ref>{{cite book |title=The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall|last=Bremmer|first=Ian|year=2007|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-7472-2|page=175}}</ref> \n\nAfter the war, he was selected as [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] (1944\u20131963), and [[President of Yugoslavia|President]] (later [[President for Life]]) (1953\u20131980) of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). From 1943 to his death in 1980, Tito held the rank of [[Marshal of Yugoslavia]], serving as the supreme commander of the Yugoslav military, the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). With a highly favourable reputation abroad in both [[Cold War]] blocs, he received some [[Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito|98 foreign decorations]], including the [[Legion of Honour]] and the [[Order of the Bath]].\n\nTito was the chief architect of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]], a [[Socialist state|socialist federation]] that lasted from November 1943 until April 1992. Despite being one of the founders of [[Cominform]], he became the first Cominform member to [[Tito\u2013Stalin Split|defy Soviet hegemony]] in 1948. He was the only leader in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s time to leave Cominform and begin with his country's [[Titoism|own socialist program]], which contained elements of [[market socialism]]. Economists active in the former Yugoslavia, including Czech-born [[Jaroslav Vanek]] and Yugoslav-born [[Branko Horvat]], promoted a model of market socialism that was dubbed the [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Illyrian model]]. Firms were [[Social ownership|socially owned]] by their employees and structured on [[workers' self-management]]; they competed in open and [[free market]]s. \n\nTito built a very powerful [[cult of personality]] around himself, which was maintained by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] after his [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|death]].\n\nTito managed to keep ethnic tensions under control by delegating as much power as possible to each republic. The [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] defined [[SFR Yugoslavia]] as a \"federal republic of equal nations and nationalities, freely united on the principle of [[brotherhood and unity]] in achieving specific and common interest.\" Each republic was also given the right to [[self-determination]] and [[secession]] if done through legal channels. Lastly, [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]], the [[SR Serbia|two constituent provinces of Serbia]], received substantially increased autonomy, including de facto veto power in the [[Serbian parliament]]. \n\nTen years after [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|his death]], [[Revolutions of 1989| Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe]], and [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslavia descended into civil war]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Pre-World War I===\n{{stack|float=left|[[File:Tito hi\u0161a1.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Tito's birthplace in the village of [[Kumrovec]], Croatia.]]}}\nJosip Broz was born on 7 May 1892 in [[Kumrovec]], a village in the northern Croatian region of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]]. At the time it was part of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Although Tito was born on 7 May, after he became president of Yugoslavia, he celebrated his birthday on 25 May to mark the unsuccessful 1944 [[Nazis|Nazi]] attempt on his life. The Germans found forged documents that stated 25 May was Tito's birthday and attacked him on that day.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=43}}}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Despite there being \"not the slightest doubt\" about the date and location of Tito's birth, many people in all parts of the former Yugoslavia give credence to various rumours about his origins.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=42}}}}\n\nHe was the seventh or eighth child of Franjo Broz (1860\u20131936) and Marija n\u00e9e Javer\u0161ek (1864\u20131918). His parents had already had a number of children die in early infancy.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=44}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=44}} Broz was christened and raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=45}} His father, Franjo, was a [[Croats|Croat]] whose family had lived in the village for three centuries, while his mother Marija, was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] from the village of [[Podsreda]]. The villages were {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} apart, and his parents had married on 21 January 1881. Franjo Broz had inherited a {{convert|10|acre|adj=on|order=flip}} estate and a good house, but he was unable to make a success of farming. Josip spent a significant proportion of his pre-school years living with his maternal grandparents at Podsreda, where he became a favourite of his grandfather Martin Javer\u0161ek. By the time he returned to Kumrovec to begin school, he spoke [[Slovene language|Slovene]] better than [[Croatian language|Croatian]],{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} and had learned to play the piano.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=46}} Despite his \"mixed parentage\", Broz identified as a Croat like his father and neighbours.{{sfn|Minahan|1998|p=50}}{{sfn|Lee|1993|p=9}}{{sfn|Laqueur|1976|p=218}}\n\nIn July 1900,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=46}} at the age of eight, Broz entered primary school at Kumrovec. He completed four years of school,{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} failing the 2nd grade and graduating in 1905.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}} As a result of his limited schooling, throughout his life Tito was poor at spelling. After leaving school, he initially worked for a maternal uncle, and then on his parents' family farm.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} In 1907, his father wanted him to emigrate to the United States, but could not raise the money for the voyage.{{sfn|West|1995|p=32}} \n\nInstead, aged 15 years, Broz left Kumrovec and travelled about {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip}} south to [[Sisak]], where his cousin Jurica Broz was doing army service. Jurica helped him get a job in a restaurant, but Broz was soon tired of that work. He approached a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[locksmith]], Nikola Karas, for a three-year apprenticeship, which included training, food, and [[room and board]]. As his father could not afford to pay for his work clothing, Broz paid for it himself. Soon after, his younger brother Stjepan also became apprenticed to Karas.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nDuring his apprenticeship, Broz was encouraged to mark [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] in 1909, and he read and sold ''Slobodna Re\u010d'' (''Free Word''), a [[Socialism|socialist]] newspaper. After completing his apprenticeship in September 1910, Broz used his contacts to gain employment in [[Zagreb]]. At the age of 18, he joined the Metal Workers' Union and participated in his first labour [[Demonstration (protest)|protest]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=6}} He also joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia]].{{sfn|Dedijer|1952|p=25}}\n\nHe returned home in December 1910.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=54}} In early 1911 he began a series of moves in search of work, first seeking work in [[Ljubljana]], then [[Trieste]], Kumrovec and Zagreb, where he worked repairing bicycles. He joined his first strike action on May Day 1911.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=6}} After a brief period of work in Ljubljana,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=54}} between May 1911 and May 1912, he worked in a factory in [[Kamnik]] in the [[Kamnik\u2013Savinja Alps]]. After it closed, he was offered redeployment to [[\u010cenkov]] in [[History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1867\u20131918)|Bohemia]]. \nOn arriving at his new workplace, he discovered that the employer was trying to bring in cheaper labour to replace the local Czech workers, and he and others joined successful strike action to force the employer to back down.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Ridley notes that since his death there have been stories written about this period in his life, some of which state that he married a Czech girl in 1912, and she bore him a son. According to Ridley, these stories are \"almost impossible to verify\".{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=55}}}}\n\nDriven by curiosity, Broz  moved to [[Plze\u0148]], where he was briefly employed at the [[\u0160koda Works]]. He next travelled to [[Munich]] in [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. He also worked at the [[Mercedes-Benz|Benz]] car factory in [[Mannheim]], and visited the [[Ruhr]] industrial region. By October 1912 he had reached [[Vienna]]. He stayed with his older brother Martin and his family, and worked at the Griedl Works before getting a job at [[Wiener Neustadt]]. There he worked for [[Austro-Daimler]], and was often asked to drive and test the cars.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=55\u201356}} During this time he spent considerable time [[fencing]] and dancing,{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=55}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=6\u20137}} and during his training and early work life, he also learned German and passable [[Czech language|Czech]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=33}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Ridley notes that some popular biographers falsely claim that he married for a second time in Vienna and had a son.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=57}}}}\n\n===World War I===\nIn May 1913,{{sfn|West|1995|p=33}} Broz was [[conscript]]ed into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]],{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=58}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|When he was conscripted into the army, his date of birth was recorded as 5 March 1892.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=43}}}} for his compulsory two years of service. He successfully requested to serve with the 25th Croatian Home Guard ({{lang-hr|Domobran|links=no}}) Regiment garrisoned in Zagreb. After learning to ski during the winter of 1913 and 1914, Broz was sent to a school for [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCO) in [[Budapest]],{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} after which he was promoted to [[sergeant major]]. At 22 years of age, he was the youngest of that rank in his regiment.{{sfn|West|1995|p=33}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Vinterhalter states that he was promoted to sergeant after completing non-commissioned officer (NCO) training.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=64}}}} At least one source states that he was the youngest sergeant major in the Austro-Hungarian Army.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=59}} After winning the regimental fencing competition,{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} Broz came in second in the army fencing championships in Budapest in May 1914.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=59}}\n\nSoon after the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the 25th Croatian Home Guard Regiment marched toward the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] border. Broz was arrested for [[sedition]] and imprisoned in the [[Petrovaradin fortress]] in present-day [[Novi Sad]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=62}} Broz later gave conflicting accounts of this arrest, telling one biographer that he had threatened to desert to the Russians, but also claiming that the whole matter arose from a clerical error.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} A third version was that he had been overheard saying that he hoped the Austro-Hungarian Empire would be defeated.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=40}} After his acquittal and release,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=62\u201363}} his regiment served briefly on the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|Serbian Front]] before being deployed to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in early 1915 to fight against [[Russian Empire|Russia]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} Tito in his own account of his military service did not mention that he participated in the failed Austrian invasion of Serbia, instead giving the misleading impression that he fought only in Galicia, as it would have offended Serbian opinion to know that he fought in 1914 for the Habsburgs against them.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=40}} On one occasion, the [[Reconnaissance|scout]] [[platoon]] he commanded went behind the enemy lines and captured 80 Russian soldiers, bringing them back to their own lines alive. In 1980 it was discovered that he had been recommended for an award for gallantry and initiative in reconnaissance and capturing prisoners.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=41\u201342}} Tito's biographer, Richard West, wrote that Tito actually downplayed his military record as the Austrian Army records showed that he was a brave soldier, which contradicted his later claim to have been opposed to the Habsburg monarchy and his self-portrait of himself as an unwilling conscript fighting in a war he was opposed to.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=41}} Broz was regarded by his fellow soldiers as ''kaisertreu'' (\"true to the Emperor\").{{sfn|West|1995|p=43}}\n\nOn 25 March 1915,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|West gives the date as 21 March,{{sfn|West|1995|p=42}} and Ridley says 4 April}} he was wounded in the back by a [[Circassia]]n cavalryman's lance,{{sfn|Gilbert|2004|p=138}} and captured during a Russian attack near [[Bukovina]].{{sfn|Frankel|1992|p=331}} Broz in his account of his capture described it melodramatically as: \"...but suddenly the right flank yielded and through the gap poured cavalry of the Circassians, from Asiatic Russia. Before we knew it they were thundering through our positions, leaping from their horses and throwing themselves into our trenches with lances lowered.

A [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] he had met while working on the railway told Broz that his son was working in an engineering works in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], so, in June 1917, Broz walked out of the unguarded POW camp and hid aboard a goods train bound for that city, where he stayed with his friend's son.{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=66\u201367}} The journalist [[Richard West (journalist)|Richard West]] has suggested that because Broz chose to remain in an unguarded POW camp rather than volunteer to serve with the Yugoslav legions of the [[Serbian Army]], this indicates that he remained loyal to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and undermines his later claim that he and other Croat POWs were excited by the prospect of revolution and looked forward to the overthrow of the empire that ruled them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=43}}\n\nLess than a month after Broz arrived in Petrograd, the [[July Days]] demonstrations broke out, and Broz joined in, coming under fire from government troops.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=67}} In the aftermath, he tried to flee to [[Finland]] in order to make his way to the United States, but was stopped at the border.{{sfn|West|1995|p=44}} He was arrested along with other suspected Bolsheviks during the subsequent crackdown by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] led by [[Alexander Kerensky]]. He was imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] for three weeks, during which he claimed to be an innocent citizen of Perm.

They recruited him into an [[Red Guards (Russia)|International Red Guard]] that guarded the Trans-Siberian Railway during the winter of 1917 and 1918. In May 1918, the anti-Bolshevik [[Czechoslovak Legion]] wrested control of parts of Siberia from Bolshevik forces, and the [[Provisional Siberian Government (Omsk)|Provisional Siberian Government]] established itself in Omsk, and Broz and his comrades went into hiding. At this time Broz met a beautiful 14-year-old local girl, Pelagija \"Polka\" Belousova, who hid him then helped him escape to a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] village {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip}} from Omsk.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=71}} Broz again worked maintaining the local mill until November 1919 when the [[Red Army]] recaptured Omsk from [[White movement|White forces]] loyal to the [[Provisional All-Russian Government]] of [[Alexander Kolchak]].

Sabi\u0107 contacted Broz who agreed to work illegally for the party, distributing leaflets and agitating among factory workers. In the contest of ideas between those that wanted to pursue moderate policies and those that advocated violent revolution, Broz sided with the latter. In 1924, Broz was elected to the CPY district committee, but after he gave a speech at a comrade's [[Catholicism|Catholic]] funeral he was arrested when the priest complained. Paraded through the streets in chains, he was held for eight days and was eventually charged with creating a public disturbance. With the help of a [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] prosecutor who hated Catholics, Broz and his co-accused were acquitted.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=80\u201382}} His brush with the law had marked him as a communist agitator, and his home was searched on an almost weekly basis. Since their arrival in Yugoslavia, Pelagija had lost three babies soon after their births, and one daughter, Zlatina, at the age of two. Broz felt the loss of Zlatina deeply. In 1924, Pelagija gave birth to a boy, \u017darko, who survived. In mid-1925, Broz's employer died and the new mill owner gave him an ultimatum, give up his communist activities or lose his job. So, at the age of 33, Broz became a professional revolutionary.{{sfn|West|1995|p=54}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=83\u201385}}\n\n===Professional revolutionary===\nThe CPY concentrated its revolutionary efforts on the factory workers in the more industrialised areas of Croatia and Slovenia, encouraging strikes and similar action.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=87}} In 1925, the now unemployed Broz moved to [[Kraljevica]] on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, where he started working at a shipyard to further the aims of the CPY.{{sfn|Auty|1970|p=53}} During his time in Karljevica, Tito acquired a love of the warm, sunny Adriatic coastline that was to last for the rest of his life, and throughout his later time as leader, he spent as much time possible living on his yacht while cruising the Adriatic.{{sfn|West|1995|p=55}} \n\nWhile at Kraljevica he worked on Yugoslav [[torpedo boat]]s and a pleasure yacht for the [[People's Radical Party]] politician, [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]]. Broz built up the trade union organisation in the shipyards and was elected as a [[union representative]]. A year later he led a shipyard strike, and soon after was fired. In October 1926 he obtained work in a railway works in [[Smederevska Palanka]] near [[Belgrade]]. In March 1927, he wrote an article complaining about the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in the factory, and after speaking up for a worker he was promptly sacked. Identified by the CPY as worthy of promotion, he was appointed secretary of the Zagreb branch of the Metal Workers' Union, and soon after of the whole Croatian branch of the union. In July 1927 Broz was arrested, along with six other workers, and imprisoned at nearby [[Ogulin]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=56}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=88\u201389}} After being held without trial for some time, Broz went on a hunger strike until a date was set. The trial was held in secret and he was found guilty of being a member of the CPY. Sentenced to four months' imprisonment, he was released from prison pending an appeal. On the orders of the CPY, Broz did not report to the court for the hearing of the appeal, instead going into hiding in Zagreb. Wearing dark spectacles and carrying forged papers, Broz posed as a middle-class technician in the engineering industry, working undercover to contact other CPY members and co-ordinate their infiltration of trade unions.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito in prison 1928.jpg|thumb|left|Tito's [[mug shot]] after arrest for communist activities in 1928|alt=a series of three black and white head and shoulders photographs]]\n\nIn February 1928, Broz was one of 32 delegates to the conference of the Croatian branch of the CPY. During the conference, Broz condemned factions within the party. These included those that advocated a [[Greater Serbia]] agenda within Yugoslavia, like the long-term CPY leader, the Serb [[Sima Markovi\u0107]]. Broz proposed that the executive committee of the [[Communist International]] purge the branch of factionalism, and was supported by a delegate sent from Moscow. After it was proposed that the entire central committee of the Croatian branch be dismissed, a new central committee was elected with Broz as its secretary.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=95\u201396}} Markovi\u0107 was subsequently expelled from the CPY at the Fourth Congress of the [[Comintern]], and the CPY adopted a policy of working for the break-up of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=96}} Broz arranged to disrupt a meeting of the [[Yugoslav Social-Democratic Party|Social-Democratic Party]] on May Day that year, and in a melee outside the venue, Broz was arrested by the police. They failed to identify him, charging him under his false name for a breach of the peace. He was imprisoned for 14 days and then released, returning to his previous activities.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=96\u201397}} The police eventually tracked him down with the help of a police informer. He was ill-treated and held for three months before being tried in court in November 1928 for his illegal communist activities,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=98\u201399}} which included allegations that the bombs that had been found at his address had been planted by the police.{{sfn|West|1995|p=57}} He was convicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=101}}\n\n===Prison===\n[[File:Tito i Mo\u0161a Pijade u zatvoru.jpg|thumb|Tito (left) and his ideological mentor [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]] while in the Lepoglava jail|alt=a black and white photograph of two men]]\n\nAfter his sentencing, his wife and son returned to Kumrovec, where they were looked after by sympathetic locals, but then one day they suddenly left without explanation and returned to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=102\u2013103}} She fell in love with another man and \u017darko grew up in institutions.{{sfn|West|1995|p=59}} After arriving at [[Lepoglava prison]], Broz was employed in maintaining the electrical system, and chose as his assistant a middle-class Belgrade Jew, [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]], who had been given a 20-year sentence for his communist activities. Their work allowed Broz and Pijade to move around the prison, contacting and organising other communist prisoners.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=103\u2013104}} During their time together in Lepoglava, Pijade became Broz's ideological mentor.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|pp=36\u201339}} After two and a half years at Lepoglava, Broz was accused of attempting to escape and was transferred to [[Maribor]] prison where he was held in solitary confinement for several months.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=106}} After completing the full term of his sentence, he was released, only to be arrested outside the prison gates and taken to Ogulin to serve the four-month sentence he had avoided in 1927. He was finally released from prison on 16 March 1934, but even then he was subject to orders that required him to live in Kumrovec and report to the police daily.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=107\u2013108 & 112}} During his imprisonment, the political situation in Europe had changed significantly, with the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany and the emergence of right-wing parties in France and neighbouring Austria. He returned to a warm welcome in Kumrovec, but did not stay for long. In early May, he received word from the CPY to return to his revolutionary activities, and left his home town for Zagreb, where he rejoined the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=109\u2013113}}\n\nThe Croatian branch of the CPY was in disarray, a situation exacerbated by the escape of the executive committee of the CPY to Vienna in Austria, from which they were directing activities. Over the next six months, Broz travelled several times between Zagreb, Ljubljana and Vienna, using false passports. In July 1934, he was blackmailed by a smuggler, but pressed on across the border, and was detained by the local ''[[Heimwehr]]'', a paramilitary Home Guard. He used the Austrian accent he had developed during his war service to convince them that he was a wayward Austrian mountaineer, and they allowed him to proceed to Vienna.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=113}}{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=147}} Once there, he contacted the General Secretary of the CPY, [[Milan Gorki\u0107]], who sent him to Ljubljana to arrange a secret conference of the CPY in Slovenia. The conference was held at the summer palace of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana|Roman Catholic bishop of Ljubljana]], whose brother was a communist sympathiser. It was at this conference that Broz first met [[Edvard Kardelj]], a young Slovene communist who had recently been released from prison. Broz and Kardelj subsequently became good friends, with Tito later regarding him as his most reliable deputy. As he was wanted by the police for failing to report to them in Kumrovec, Broz adopted various pseudonyms, including \"Rudi\" and \"Tito\". He used the latter as a pen name when he wrote articles for party journals in 1934, and it stuck. He gave no reason for choosing the name \"Tito\" except that it was a common nickname for men from the district where he grew up. Within the Comintern network, his nickname was \"Walter\".{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=114\u2013115}}{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=151}}\n\n===Flight from Yugoslavia===\n[[File:Edvard Kardelj zatvorenik.jpg|thumb|left|Edvard Kardelj met Tito in 1934 and they became close friends|alt=two black and white mugshots]]\n\nDuring this time Tito wrote articles on the duties of imprisoned communists and on trade unions. He was in Ljubljana when [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] was assassinated by the Croatian nationalist ''[[Usta\u0161e]]'' organisation in Marseilles on 9 October 1934. In the crackdown on dissidents that followed his death, it was decided that Tito should leave Yugoslavia. He travelled to Vienna on a forged Czech passport where he joined Gorki\u0107 and the rest of the [[Politburo]] of the CPY. It was decided that the Austrian government was too hostile to communism, so the Politburo travelled to [[Brno]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], and Tito accompanied them.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=116\u2013117}} On Christmas Day 1934, a secret meeting of the Central Committee of the CPY was held in Ljubljana, and Tito was elected as a member of the Politburo for the first time. The Politburo decided to send him to Moscow to report on the situation in Yugoslavia, and in early February 1935 he arrived there as full-time official of the Comintern.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=117\u2013118}} He lodged at the main Comintern residence, the [[Hotel Lux]] on [[Tverskaya Street]], and was quickly in contact with [[Vladimir \u0106opi\u0107]], one of the leading Yugoslavs with the Comintern. He was soon introduced to the main personalities in the organisation. Tito was appointed to the secretariat of the Balkan section, responsible for Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=120}} Kardelj was also in Moscow, as was the Bulgarian communist leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}} Tito lectured on trade unions to foreign communists, and attended a course on military tactics run by the Red Army, and occasionally attended the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. He attended as one of 510 delegates to the [[Seventh World Congress of the Comintern]] in July and August 1935, where he briefly saw [[Joseph Stalin]] for the first time. After the congress, he toured the Soviet Union, then returned to Moscow to continue his work. He contacted Polka and \u017darko, but soon fell in love with an Austrian woman who worked at the Hotel Lux, Johanna Koenig, known within communist ranks as Lucia Bauer. When she became aware of this liaison, Polka divorced Tito in April 1936. Tito married Bauer on 13 October of that year.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nAfter the World Congress, Tito worked to promote the new Comintern line on Yugoslavia, which was that it would no longer work to break up the country, and would instead defend the integrity of Yugoslavia against Nazism and Fascism. From a distance, Tito also worked to organise strikes at the shipyards at Kraljevica and the coal mines at [[Trbovlje]] near Ljubljana. He tried to convince the Comintern that it would be better if the party leadership was located inside Yugoslavia. A compromise was arrived at, where Tito and others would work inside the country and Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo would continue to work from abroad. Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo relocated to Paris, while Tito began to travel between Moscow, Paris and Zagreb in 1936 and 1937, using false passports.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=122\u2013123}} In 1936, his father died.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}\n\n[[File:\u0160panski borci.jpg|thumb|Yugoslav volunteers fighting in the Spanish Civil War|alt=black and white photograph of men firing weapons]]\n\nTito returned to Moscow in August 1936, soon after the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=124}} At the time, the [[Great Purge]] was underway, and foreign communists like Tito and his Yugoslav compatriots were particularly vulnerable. Despite a laudatory report written by Tito about the veteran Yugoslav communist [[Filip Filipovi\u0107 (politician)|Filip Filipovi\u0107]], Filipovi\u0107 was arrested and shot by the Soviet secret police, the [[NKVD]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=126\u2013127}} However, before the Purge really began to erode the ranks of the Yugoslav communists in Moscow, Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia with a new mission, to recruit [[Yugoslav volunteers in the Spanish Civil War|volunteers]] for the [[International Brigades]] being raised to fight on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. Travelling via Vienna, he reached the coastal port city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in December 1936.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} According to the Croatian historian [[Ivo Banac]], the reason Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia by the Comintern was in order to purge the CPY.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} An initial attempt to send 500 volunteers to Spain by ship failed utterly, with nearly all the communist volunteers being arrested and imprisoned.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} Tito then travelled to Paris, where he arranged the travel of volunteers to France under the cover of attending the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris Exhibition]]. Once in France, the volunteers simply crossed the [[Pyrenees]] to Spain. In all, he sent 1,192 men to fight in the war, but only 330 came from Yugoslavia, the rest being expatriates in France, Belgium, the U.S. and Canada. Less than half were communists, and the rest were social-democrats and anti-fascists of various hues. Of the total, 671 were killed in the fighting and another 300 were wounded. Tito himself never went to Spain, despite later claims that he had. Between May and August 1937, Tito travelled several times between Paris and Zagreb organising the movement of volunteers and creating a separate [[League of Communists of Croatia|Communist Party of Croatia]]. The new party was inaugurated at a conference at [[Samobor]] on the outskirts of Zagreb on 1\u20132 August 1937.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=131\u2013133}}\n\n===General Secretary of the CPY===\nIn June 1937, Gorki\u0107 was summoned to Moscow, where he was arrested, and after months of NKVD interrogation, he was shot.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=134}} According to Banac, Gorki\u0107 was killed on Stalin's orders.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} West concludes that despite being in competition with men like Gorki\u0107 for the leadership of the CPY, it was not in Tito's character to have innocent people sent to their deaths.{{sfn|West|1995|p=63}} Tito then received a message from the Politburo of the CPY to join them in Paris. In August 1937 he became acting [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia|General Secretary of the CPY]]. He later explained that he survived the Purge by staying out of Spain where the NKVD was active, and also by avoiding visiting the Soviet Union as much as possible. When first appointed as general secretary, he avoided travelling to Moscow by insisting that he needed to deal with some indiscipline in the CPY in Paris. He also promoted the idea that the upper echelons of the CPY should be sharing the dangers of underground resistance within the country.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=134\u2013135}} He developed a new, younger leadership team that was loyal to him, including the Slovene Kardelj, the [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], and the [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]].{{sfn|West|1995|pp=63\u201364}} In December 1937, Tito arranged for a demonstration to greet the French foreign minister when he visited Belgrade, expressing solidarity with the French against Nazi Germany. The protest march numbered 30,000 and turned into a protest against the neutrality policy of the Stojadinovi\u0107 government. It was eventually broken up by the police. In March 1938 Tito returned to Yugoslavia from Paris. Hearing a rumour that his opponents within the CPY had tipped off the police, he travelled to Belgrade rather than Zagreb and used a different passport. While in Belgrade he stayed with a young intellectual, [[Vladimir Dedijer]], who was a friend of \u0110ilas. Arriving in Yugoslavia a few days ahead of the ''[[Anschluss]]'' between Nazi Germany and Austria, he made an appeal condemning it, in which the CPY was joined by the Social Democrats and trade unions. In June, Tito wrote to the Comintern suggesting that he should visit Moscow. He waited in Paris for two months for his Soviet visa before travelling to Moscow via Copenhagen. He arrived in Moscow on 24 August.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito's fake Canadian ID, 1939.jpg|thumb|Fake Canadian ID, \"Spiridon Mekas\", used for returning to Yugoslavia from Moscow, 1939]]\n\nOn arrival in Moscow, he found that all Yugoslav communists were under suspicion. Nearly all the most prominent leaders of the CPY were arrested by the NKVD and executed, including over twenty members of the Central Committee. Both his ex-wife Polka and his wife Koenig/Bauer were arrested as \"imperialist spies\", although they were both eventually released, Polka after 27 months in prison. Tito therefore needed to make arrangements for the care of \u017darko, who was fourteen. He placed him a boarding school outside [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], then at a school at [[Penza]], but he ran away twice and was eventually taken in by a friend's mother. In 1941, \u017darko joined the Red Army to fight the invading Germans.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=137}} Some of Tito's critics argue that his survival indicates he must have denounced his comrades as [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]. He was asked for information on a number of his fellow Yugoslav communists, but according to his own statements and published documents, he never denounced anyone, usually saying he did not know them. In one case he was asked about the Croatian communist leader Horvatin, but wrote ambiguously, saying that he did not know whether he was a Trotskyist. Nevertheless, Horvatin was not heard of again. While in Moscow, he was given the task of assisting \u0106opi\u0107 to translate the ''History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'' into [[Serbo-Croatian]], but they had only got to the second chapter when \u0106opi\u0107 too was arrested and executed. He worked on with a fellow surviving Yugoslav communist, but a Yugoslav communist of German ethnicity reported an inaccurate translation of a passage and claimed it showed Tito was a Trotskyist. Other influential communists vouched for him, and he was exonerated. He was denounced by a second Yugoslav communist, but the action backfired and his accuser was arrested. Several factors were at play in his survival; working class origins, lack of interest in intellectual arguments about socialism, attractive personality and capacity for making influential friends.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nWhile Tito was avoiding arrest in Moscow, Germany was placing pressure on Czechoslovakia to cede the [[Sudetenland]]. In response to this threat, Tito organised for a call for Yugoslav volunteers to fight for Czechoslovakia, and thousands of volunteers came to the Czechoslovak embassy in Belgrade to offer their services. Despite the eventual [[Munich Agreement]] and Czechoslovak acceptance of the annexation and the fact that the volunteers were turned away, Tito claimed credit for the Yugoslav response, which worked in his favour. By this stage, Tito was well aware of the realities in the Soviet Union, later stating that he \"witnessed a great many injustices\", but was too heavily invested in communism and too loyal to the Soviet Union to step back at this point.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=140\u2013141}} Tito's appointment as General Secretary of the CPY was formally ratified by the Comintern on 5 January 1939.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=135}}\n\nHe was appointed to the Committee and started to appoint allies to him, among them [[Edvard Kardelj]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] and [[Boris Kidri\u010d]].\n\n==World War II==\n{{See also|World War II in Yugoslavia}}\n\n===Resistance in Yugoslavia===\nOn 6 April 1941, [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces, with [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungarian]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] assistance, launched an [[invasion of Yugoslavia]].

In fact, Stalin and Tito had an uneasy alliance from the start, with Stalin considering Tito too independent.\n\nDuring the immediate post-war period Tito's Yugoslavia had a strong commitment to orthodox Marxist ideas. Harsh repressive measures against dissidents were common, including \"arrests, show trials, forced collectivisation, suppression of churches and religion\".{{sfn|Forsythe|2009|p=47}} As the leader of Yugoslavia, Tito displayed a fondness for luxury, taking over the royal palaces that had belonged to the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 together with the former palaces used by the House of Habsburg that were located in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|West|1995|p=196-197}} Tito's governing style was very monarchical, as his tours across Yugoslavia in the former royal train closely resembled the royal tours of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 kings and Habsburg emperors, and in Serbia he adopted the traditional royal custom of being a godfather to every 9th son.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Tito modified the custom by becoming a godfather to every 9th daughter as well after criticism was made that the practice was sexist.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Just like a Serbian king, Tito would appear wherever a 9th child was born to the family to congratulate the parents and give them a gift of cash.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Tito always spoke very harshly of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 kings in both public and private (through in private, he sometimes had a kind word for the Habsburgs), but in many ways he appeared to his people as a sort of king.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}}\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===Tito\u2013Stalin split===\n{{Main|Tito\u2013Stalin split}}\n[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt and Josip Broz Tito 1953.jpg|thumb|Josip Broz Tito greeting former U.S. first lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] during her July 1953 visit to Yugoslavia]]\n[[File:Resolucija VII. kongresa o prihodnjih nalogah ZKJ.jpg|thumb|Kardelj, Rankovi\u0107 and Tito in 1958]]\n[[File:Tito in Kumrovec, 1961.jpg|thumb|Josip Broz Tito visiting his birthplace [[Kumrovec]] in 1961]]\n\nUnlike other states in east-central Europe liberated by allied forces, Yugoslavia liberated itself from Axis domination with limited direct support from the [[Red Army]]. Tito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia had more room to follow its own interests than other Bloc leaders who had more reasons to recognise Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control. Although Tito was formally an ally of Stalin after World War II, the Soviets had set up a spy ring in the Yugoslav party as early as 1945, giving way to an uneasy alliance.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.at/books?id=J34leeCdXFQC&pg=PT120&lpg=PT120&dq=soviet+spy+ring+yugoslav+party+1945&source=bl&ots=dIXuH8A3Lq&sig=WWgnE0DnV6KfklOSYccGita4xHw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjoq7bWgb3fAhVHzKQKHQmsCu8Q6AEwDHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=soviet%20spy%20ring%20yugoslav%20party%201945&f=false|title=Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia|last=West|first=Richard|date=2012-11-15|publisher=Faber|isbn=9780571281107|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=12 The Quarrel with Stalin}}</ref>\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War II, several armed incidents occurred between Yugoslavia and the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]. Following the war, Yugoslavia acquired the Italian territory of [[Istria]] as well as the cities of [[Zadar]] and [[Rijeka]]. Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate [[Trieste]] into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies. This led to several armed incidents, notably attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on U.S. transport aircraft, causing bitter criticism from the West. In 1946 alone, Yugoslav air-force shot down two U.S. transport aircraft. The passengers and crew of the first plane were secretly interned by the Yugoslav government. The second plane and its crew were a total loss. The U.S. was outraged and sent an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government, demanding the release of the Americans in custody, U.S. access to the downed planes, and full investigation of the incidents.<ref>https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/89147/RICE0184.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt the USSR unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II and at the time when U.S. had operational nuclear weapons whereas the USSR had yet to conduct its first test. In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the Communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]], while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill not to pursue Soviet interests there, although he did support the Greek communist struggle politically, as demonstrated in several assemblies of the UN Security Council. In 1948, motivated by the desire to create a strong independent economy, Tito modelled his economic development plan independently from Moscow, which resulted in a diplomatic escalation followed by a bitter exchange of letters in which Tito wrote that \"We study and take as an example the Soviet system, but develop it a different form\".<ref>https://schoolworkhelper.net/tito-stalin-dispute-1948-timeline-analysis-significance/</ref>\n\nThe Soviet answer on 4 May admonished Tito and the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (CPY) for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse them of being too proud of their successes against the Germans, maintaining that the Red Army had saved them from destruction. Tito's response on 17 May suggested that the matter be settled at the meeting of the Cominform to be held that June. However, Tito did not attend the second meeting of the [[Cominform]], fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. In 1949 the crisis nearly escalated into an armed conflict, as Hungarian and Soviet forces were massing on the northern Yugoslav frontier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800593,00.html|title=No Words Left?|work=Time Magazine|date=22 August 1949|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> An invasion of Yugoslavia was planned to be carried out in 1949 via the combined forces of neighbouring Soviet satellite states of Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania, followed by the subsequent removal of Tito's government. On 28 June, the other member countries of the Cominform expelled Yugoslavia, citing \"nationalist elements\" that had \"managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership\" of the CPY. The Hungarian and Romanian armies were expanded in size and, together with Soviet ones, massed on the Yugoslav border. The assumption in Moscow was that once it was known that he had lost Soviet approval, Tito would collapse; \"I will shake my little finger and there will be no more Tito,\" Stalin remarked.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laar |first=M. |year=2009 |title=The Power of Freedom.

Stalin took the matter personally and arranged several assassination attempts on Tito, none of which succeeded. In a correspondence between the two leaders, Tito openly wrote:\n\n{{quote|Stop sending people to kill me. We've already captured five of them, one of them with a bomb and another with a rifle.

Prominent partisans, such as [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]] and [[Dragoljub Mi\u0107unovi\u0107]], were victims of this period of strong repression, which lasted until 1956 and was marked by significant violations of human rights.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SAyizpsg-Z8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Accommodating+National+Identity:+New+Approaches+in+International+and+Domestic+Law#v=onepage&q=Accommodating%20National%20Identity%3A%20New%20Approaches%20in%20International%20and%20Domestic%20Law&f=false |title=Accommodating National Identity: New Approaches in International and Domestic Law - Page 17|last=Tierney|first=Stephen |year=2000|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-411-1400-6|page=17}}<br />\"''Human rights were routinely suppressed...''\"</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Iz6pvc3YSr0C&pg=PA37&dq=tito+regime+human+rights#v=onepage&q=tito%20regime%20human%20rights&f=false|title=No More: The Battle Against Human Rights Violations - Page 37, D.

The facilities at Goli Otok were abandoned in 1956, and jurisdiction of the now-defunct political prison was handed over to the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]].\n\n[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Ho Chi Minh, Josip Broz Tito and Edvard Kardelj, Beograd, avgust 1957.jpg|thumb|left|Tito with North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] in Belgrade, 1957]]\n\nTito's estrangement from the USSR enabled Yugoslavia to obtain U.S. aid via the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA), the same U.S. aid institution that administered the [[Marshall Plan]]. Still, he did not agree to align with the West, which was a common consequence of accepting American aid at the time. After Stalin's death in 1953, relations with the USSR were relaxed, and Tito began to receive aid as well from the COMECON. In this way, Tito played East\u2013West antagonism to his advantage. Instead of choosing sides, he was instrumental in kick-starting the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which would function as a \"third way\" for countries interested in staying outside of the East\u2013West divide.<ref name=\"nonaligned-chief\" />\n\nThe event was significant not only for Yugoslavia and Tito, but also for the global development of socialism, since it was the first major split between Communist states, casting doubt on Comintern's claims for socialism to be a unified force that would eventually control the whole world, as Tito became the first (and the only successful) socialist leader to defy Stalin's leadership in the [[COMINFORM]]. This rift with the [[Soviet Union]] brought Tito much international recognition, but also triggered a period of instability often referred to as the [[Informbiro]] period. Tito's form of communism was labelled \"[[Titoism]]\" by Moscow, which encouraged purges against suspected \"Titoites'\" throughout the [[Eastern bloc]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n[[File:Tito i Hrushchov.jpg|thumb|Tito and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in [[Skopje]] after the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|1963 earthquake]]]]\n\nOn 26 June 1950, the National Assembly supported a crucial bill written by [[Milovan \u0110ilas]] and Tito regarding \"[[Workers' self-management|self-management]]\" (''samoupravljanje''), a type of cooperative independent socialist experiment that introduced [[profit sharing]] and [[workplace democracy]] in previously state-run enterprises, which then became the direct social ownership of the employees. On 13 January 1953, they established that the law on self-management was the basis of the entire social order in Yugoslavia. Tito also succeeded [[Ivan Ribar]] as the President of Yugoslavia on 14 January 1953. After Stalin's death, Tito rejected the USSR's invitation for a visit to discuss normalisation of relations between the two nations. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] visited Tito in Belgrade in 1955 and apologised for wrongdoings by Stalin's administration. Tito visited the USSR in 1956, which signalled to the world that animosity between Yugoslavia and USSR was easing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862216,00.html |title=Discrimination in a Tomb|work=Time |date=18 June 1956|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> However, the relationship would reach another low in the late 1960s.<ref name=\"Christman\">{{cite book |last1=Broz Tito |first1=Josip |last2=Christman |first2= Henry M. |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1970 |title=The Essential Tito |page=69}}<br />''\"The truth is that it is, at best, disloyal and unobjective behaviour towards our party and the country.

In 1961, Tito co-founded the movement with Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], India's [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Indonesia's [[Sukarno]] and Ghana's [[Kwame Nkrumah]], in an action called The Initiative of Five (Tito, Nehru, Nasser, Sukarno, Nkrumah), thus establishing strong ties with [[third world]] countries. This move did much to improve Yugoslavia's diplomatic position. Tito saw the Non-Aligned Movement as a way of presenting himself as a world leader of an important bloc of nations that would improve his bargaining power with both the eastern and western blocs.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} On 1 September 1961, Josip Broz Tito became the first [[Non-Aligned Movement#Secretaries-General|Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement]].\n\nTito's foreign policy led to relationships with a variety of governments, such as exchanging visits (1954 and 1956) with [[Emperor Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia, where a street was named in his honour. In 1953, Tito visited Ethiopia and in 1954, the Emperor visited Yugoslavia.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Tito's motives in befriending Ethiopia were somewhat self-interested as he wanted to send recent graduates of Yugoslav universities (whose standards were not up to those of Western universities, thus making them unemployable in the West) to work in Ethiopia, which was one of the few countries that was willing to accept them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} As Ethiopia did not have much of a health care system or a university system, Haile Selassie from 1953 onward encouraged the graduates of Yugoslav universities, especially with medical degrees, to come work in his empire.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Reflecting his tendency to pursue closer ties with Third World nations, from 1950 onward, Tito permitted Mexican films to be shown in Yugoslavia, where they become very popular, especially the 1950 film ''Un d\u00eda de vida'', which become a huge hit when it premiered in Yugoslavia in 1952.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=160}} The success of Mexican films led to the \"[[Yu-Mex]]\" craze of the 1950s-1960s as Mexican music become popular and it was fashionable for many Yugoslav musicians to don sombreros and sing Mexican songs in Serbo-Croatian.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=161-162}}       \n\nTito was notable for pursuing a foreign policy of neutrality during the [[Cold War]] and for establishing close ties with developing countries. Tito's strong belief in self-determination caused  the 1948 rift with Stalin and consequently, the [[Eastern Bloc]]. His public speeches often reiterated that policy of neutrality and co-operation with all countries would be natural as long as these countries did not use their influence to pressure Yugoslavia to take sides. Relations with the United States and Western European nations were generally cordial. \n\nIn the early 1950s, Yugoslav-Hungarian relations were strained as Tito made little secret of his distaste for the Stalinist [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] and his preference for the \"national communist\" [[Imre Nagy]] instead.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495}} Tito's decision to create a \"Balkan bloc\" by signing a treaty of alliance with NATO members Turkey and Greece in 1954 was regarded as tantamount to joining NATO in Soviet eyes, and his vague talk of a neutralist Communist federation of Eastern European states was seen as a major threat in Moscow.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495-496}} The Yugoslav embassy in Budapest was seen by the Soviets as a center of subversion in Hungary as they accused Yugoslav diplomats and journalists, sometimes with justification, of supporting Nagy.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=496-497}} However, when the revolt broke out in Hungary in October 1956, Tito accused Nagy of losing control of the situation, as he wanted a Communist Hungary independent of the Soviet Union, not the overthrow of Hungarian Communism.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} On 31 October 1956, Tito ordered the Yugoslav media to stop praising Nagy and he quietly supported the Soviet intervention on 4 November to end the revolt in Hungary, as he believed that a Hungary ruled by anti-communists would pursue irredentist claims against Yugoslavia, just had been the case during the interwar period.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} To escape from the Soviets, Nagy fled to the Yugoslav embassy, where Tito granted him asylum.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=501}} On 5 November 1956, Soviet tanks shelled the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest, killing the Yugoslav cultural attache and several other diplomats.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Tito's refusal to turn over Nagy, despite increasingly shrill Soviet demands that he do so, served his purposes well with relations with the Western states, as he was presented in the Western media as the \"good communist\" who stood up to Moscow by sheltering Nagy and the other Hungarian leaders.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=503-504}} On 22 November, Nagy and his cabinet left the embassy on a bus that was take them into exile in Yugoslavia after the new Hungarian leader, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] had promised Tito in writing that they would not be harmed.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Much to Tito's fury, when the bus left the Yugoslav embassy, it was promptly boarded by KGB agents who arrested the Hungarian leaders and roughly handled the Yugoslav diplomats who tried to protect them.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} The kidnapping of Nagy, followed by his subsequent execution, almost led to Yugoslavia breaking off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and in 1957 Tito boycotted the ceremonials in Moscow for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, being the only communist leader who did not attend the occasion.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505-506}}     \n\nYugoslavia had a liberal travel policy permitting foreigners to freely travel through the country and its citizens to travel worldwide,<ref name=\"Socialism of Sorts\"/> whereas it was limited by most Communist countries. A number{{quantify|date=October 2015}} of Yugoslav citizens worked throughout Western Europe. Tito met many world leaders during his rule, such as Soviet rulers [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]]; [[Egypt]]'s [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], Indian politicians [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Indira Gandhi]]; British Prime Ministers [[Winston Churchill]], [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]; U.S. Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]]; other political leaders, dignitaries and heads of state that Tito met at least once in his lifetime included [[Che Guevara]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Willy Brandt]], [[Helmut Schmidt]], [[Georges Pompidou]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Kim Il-sung|Kim Il Sung]], [[Sukarno]], [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], [[Suharto]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Gaddafi]], [[Erich Honecker]], [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]], [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] and [[Urho Kekkonen]]. He also met numerous celebrities.\n\nYugoslavia provided major assistance to anti-colonialist movements in the Third World. The Yugoslav delegation was the first to bring the demands of the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]] to the United Nations. In January 1958, the French navy boarded the Slovenija cargo ship off [[Oran]], whose holds were filled with weapons for the insurgents. Diplomat Danilo Milic explained that \"Tito and the leading nucleus of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] really saw in the Third World's liberation struggles a replica of their own struggle against the fascist occupants. They vibrated to the rhythm of the advances or setbacks of the FLN or [[Vietcong]].<ref name=mo>Au temps de la Yougoslavie anticoloniale</ref> \u00bb \n\nThousands of Yugoslav cooperants travelled  [[Guinea]] after its decolonisation and as the French government tried to destabilise the country. Tito also supported the liberation movements of the Portuguese colonies in Africa. He saw the murder of [[Patrice Lumumba]] in 1961 as the \"greatest crime in contemporary history\". The country's military schools hosted activists from [[Swapo]] (Namibia) and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania]] (South Africa). In 1980, the secret services of South Africa and Argentina planned to bring 1,500 anti-communist guerrillas to Yugoslavia.  The operation was aimed at overthrowing Tito and was planned during the Olympic Games period so that the Soviets would be too busy to react. The operation was finally abandoned due to Tito's death and while the Yugoslav armed forces raised their alert level.<ref name=mo />\n\nIn 1953, Tito traveled to Britain for a state visit and met with [[Winston Churchill]]. He also toured [[Cambridge]] and visited the University Library.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/workspaces/BritishPathe/NgGe1fPW |title=Pathe News films of state visit |accessdate=15 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nTito visited India from 22 December 1954 through 8 January 1955.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.titoville.com/partthree.html |title=Josip Broz Tito Chronology |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109100200/http://www.titoville.com/partthree.html |archivedate=9 November 2000 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After his return, he removed many restrictions on churches and spiritual institutions in Yugoslavia.\n\nTito also developed warm relations with [[Burma]] under [[U Nu]], travelling to the country in 1955 and again in 1959, though he didn't receive the same treatment in 1959 from the new leader, [[Ne Win]]. Tito had an especially close friendship with Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia who preached an eccentric mixture of monarchism, Buddhism, and socialism and like Tito wanted his country to be neutral in the Cold War.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=283}} Tito saw Sihanouk as something of a kindred soul who like him had to struggle to maintain his backward country's neutrality in face of rival power blocs.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=283}} By contrast, Tito had a strong dislike of President Idi Amin of Uganda whom he saw as a thuggish and possibly insane leader.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=284}}\n\nBecause of its neutrality, Yugoslavia would often be rare among Communist countries to have diplomatic relations with right-wing, [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] governments.

His position as a party whip and Tito's way of controlling and monitoring the government and, to a certain extent the people, bothered many, especially the younger, newer generation of government officials who were working towards a more liberal Yugoslav society. In the same year Tito declared that Communists must henceforth chart Yugoslavia's course by the force of their arguments (implying an abandonment of Leninist orthodoxy and development of liberal Communism).<ref name=\"Payne\">{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Stanley |title=Spain: A Unique History |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press |year=2011 |page=227 |isbn=978-0299249335}}</ref> The [[State Security Administration]] (UDBA) saw its power scaled back and its staff reduced to 5000 after the removal of Rankovi\u0107.

In his speech before the Federal Assembly he introduced 20 sweeping constitutional amendments that would provide an updated framework on which the country would be based. The amendments provided for a collective presidency, a 22-member body consisting of elected representatives from six republics and two autonomous provinces. The body would have a single chairman of the presidency and chairmanship would rotate among six republics. When the Federal Assembly fails to agree on legislation, the collective presidency would have the power to rule by decree. Amendments also provided for stronger cabinet with considerable power to initiate and pursue legislation independently from the Communist Party. [[D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107]] was chosen as the Premier. The new amendments aimed to decentralise the country by granting greater autonomy to republics and provinces. The federal government would retain authority only over foreign affairs, defence, internal security, monetary affairs, free trade within Yugoslavia, and development loans to poorer regions.

Tito was just shy of his 60th birthday, while she was 27, when they finally married in April 1952, with state security chief [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] as the best man. Their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since Tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante Ivan Krajacic brought her in originally. At that time, she was in her early 20s and Tito objected to her energetic personality. Not one to be discouraged easily, Jovanka continued working at [[Beli Dvor]], where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance. Their relationship was not a happy one, however. It had gone through many, often public, ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' by the latter pair. Certain unofficial reports suggest Tito and Jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s, shortly before his death. However, during Tito's funeral she was officially present as his wife, and later claimed rights for inheritance. The couple did not have any children.\n\nTito's grandchildren include [[Sa\u0161a Broz]], a theatre director in Croatia; [[Svetlana Broz]], a cardiologist and writer in Bosnia-Herzegovina; and [[Josip Broz Jo\u0161ka|Josip Broz \u2013 Jo\u0161ka]], [[Edvard Broz]] and [[Natali Klasevski]], an artisan of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nAs the [[President of Yugoslavia|President]], Tito had access to extensive (state-owned) property associated with the office, and maintained a lavish lifestyle. In Belgrade he resided in the official residence, the [[Beli dvor]], and maintained a separate private home. The [[Brijuni islands]] were the site of the State Summer Residence from 1949 on. The pavilion was designed by [[Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik]], and included a zoo. Close to 100 foreign heads of state were to visit Tito at the island residence, along with film stars such as [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Carlo Ponti]], and [[Gina Lollobrigida]].\n\nAnother residence was maintained at [[Lake Bled]], while the grounds at [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evo (Ba\u010dka Palanka)|Kara\u0111or\u0111evo]] were the site of \"diplomatic hunts\".

The report noted that his speech had features of other Slavic languages (Russian and Polish). The hypothesis that \"a non-Yugoslav, perhaps a Russian or a Pole\" assumed Tito's identity was included with a note that this had happened during or before the Second World War.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Is Yugoslav President Tito Really a Yugoslav?|journal=Cryptologic Spectrum|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/is_yugoslav.pdf|id=(b) (3)-P.L. 86-36|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511130906/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/is_yugoslav.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The report notes [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]'s impressions of Tito's Russian origins after he had personally spoken with Tito.\n\nHowever, the NSA's report was completely invalidated by Croatian experts. The report failed to recognise that Tito was a native speaker of the very distinctive local [[Kajkavian]] dialect of Zagorje. His acute accent, present only in Croatian dialects, and which Tito was able to pronounce perfectly, is the strongest evidence for his Zagorje origins.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/tajna-sluzba-nije-znala-samo-jednu-sitnicu---da-postoje-kajkavci/1121913/ | title=Tajna slu\u017eba nije znala samo jednu sitnicu \u2013 da postoje kajkavci | last=Jozi\u0107 | first=\u017deljko | work=[[Jutarnji list]] | date=24 August 2013 | language=Croatian | accessdate=2013-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Origin of the name \"Tito\"===\nAs the Communist Party was outlawed in Yugoslavia starting on 30 December 1920, Josip Broz took on many assumed names during his activity within the Party, including \"Rudi\", \"Walter\", and \"Tito.\"<ref>Vladimir Dedijer, ''Tito Speaks'', 1953, p. 80.</ref> Broz himself explains:\n\n{{quote|It was a rule in the Party in those times not to use one's real name, in order to reduce the chances of exposure. For instance, if someone working with me was arrested, and flogged into revealing my real name, the police would easily trace me. But the police never knew the real person hiding behind an assumed name, such as I had in the Party. Naturally, even the assumed names often had to be changed. Even before going to prison I had taken the name of Gligorijevi\u0107, and of Zagorac, meaning the 'man from Zagorje'. I even signed a few newspaper articles with the second.\n\nNow I had to take a new name. I adopted first the name of Rudi, but another comrade had the same name and so I was obliged to change it, adopting the name Tito. I hardly ever used Tito at first; I assumed it exclusively in 1938, when I began to sign articles with it. Why did I take this name 'Tito' and has it special significance? I took it as I would have any other, because it occurred to me at the moment. Apart from that, this name is quite frequent in my native district. The best-known Zagorje writer of the late eighteenth century was called [[Titu\u0161 Brezova\u010dki|Tito Brezova\u010dki]]; his witty comedies are still given in the Croatian theatre after more than a hundred years. The father of [[Ksaver \u0160andor Gjalski]], one of the greatest Croatian writers, was also called Tito.<ref>Dedijer, p. 81</ref>}}\n\n==Awards and decorations==\n{{main|Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito}}\nJosip Broz Tito received a total of 119 awards and decorations from 60 countries around the world (59 countries and Yugoslavia). 21 decorations were from [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] itself, 18 having been awarded once, and the [[Order of the National Hero]] on three occasions. Of the 98 international awards and decorations, 92 were received once, and three on two occasions ([[Order of the White Lion]], [[Order of Polonia Restituta|Polonia Restituta]], and [[Order of Karl Marx|Karl Marx]]). The most notable awards included the French [[Legion of Honour]] and [[National Order of Merit (France)|National Order of Merit]], the British [[Order of the Bath]], the Soviet [[Order of Lenin]], the Japanese [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], the West German [[Federal Cross of Merit]], and the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Order of Merit of Italy]].\n\nThe decorations were seldom displayed, however. After the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] of 1948 and his inauguration as president in 1953, Tito rarely wore his uniform except when present in a military function, and then (with rare exception) only wore his Yugoslav ribbons for obvious practical reasons.

Drafted into military service, he distinguished himself, becoming the youngest [[sergeant major]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] of that time. After being seriously wounded and captured by the Imperial Russians during [[World War I]], he was sent to a work camp in the [[Ural Mountains]]. He participated in some events of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and the subsequent [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]]. \n\nUpon his return to the Balkans in 1918, Broz entered the newly established [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], where he joined the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ). He later was elected as General Secretary (later Chairman of the Presidium) of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (1939\u20131980). During [[World War II]], after the Nazi invasion of the area, he led the Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] (1941\u20131945).<ref>{{cite book |title=The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall|last=Bremmer|first=Ian|year=2007|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-7472-2|page=175}}</ref> \n\nAfter the war, he was selected as [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] (1944\u20131963), and [[President of Yugoslavia|President]] (later [[President for Life]]) (1953\u20131980) of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). From 1943 to his death in 1980, Tito held the rank of [[Marshal of Yugoslavia]], serving as the supreme commander of the Yugoslav military, the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). With a highly favourable reputation abroad in both [[Cold War]] blocs, he received some [[Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito|98 foreign decorations]], including the [[Legion of Honour]] and the [[Order of the Bath]].\n\nTito was the chief architect of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]], a [[Socialist state|socialist federation]] that lasted from November 1943 until April 1992. Despite being one of the founders of [[Cominform]], he became the first Cominform member to [[Tito\u2013Stalin Split|defy Soviet hegemony]] in 1948. He was the only leader in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s time to leave Cominform and begin with his country's [[Titoism|own socialist program]], which contained elements of [[market socialism]]. Economists active in the former Yugoslavia, including Czech-born [[Jaroslav Vanek]] and Yugoslav-born [[Branko Horvat]], promoted a model of market socialism that was dubbed the [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Illyrian model]]. Firms were [[Social ownership|socially owned]] by their employees and structured on [[workers' self-management]]; they competed in open and [[free market]]s. \n\nTito built a very powerful [[cult of personality]] around himself, which was maintained by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] after his [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|death]].\n\nTito managed to keep ethnic tensions under control by delegating as much power as possible to each republic. The [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] defined [[SFR Yugoslavia]] as a \"federal republic of equal nations and nationalities, freely united on the principle of [[brotherhood and unity]] in achieving specific and common interest.\" Each republic was also given the right to [[self-determination]] and [[secession]] if done through legal channels. Lastly, [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]], the [[SR Serbia|two constituent provinces of Serbia]], received substantially increased autonomy, including de facto veto power in the [[Serbian parliament]]. \n\nTen years after [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|his death]], [[Revolutions of 1989| Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe]], and [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslavia descended into civil war]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Pre-World War I===\n{{stack|float=left|[[File:Tito hi\u0161a1.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Tito's birthplace in the village of [[Kumrovec]], Croatia.]]}}\nJosip Broz was born on 7 May 1892 in [[Kumrovec]], a village in the northern Croatian region of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]]. At the time it was part of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Although Tito was born on 7 May, after he became president of Yugoslavia, he celebrated his birthday on 25 May to mark the unsuccessful 1944 [[Nazis|Nazi]] attempt on his life. The Germans found forged documents that stated 25 May was Tito's birthday and attacked him on that day.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=43}}}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Despite there being \"not the slightest doubt\" about the date and location of Tito's birth, many people in all parts of the former Yugoslavia give credence to various rumours about his origins.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=42}}}}\n\nHe was the seventh or eighth child of Franjo Broz (1860\u20131936) and Marija n\u00e9e Javer\u0161ek (1864\u20131918). His parents had already had a number of children die in early infancy.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=44}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=44}} Broz was christened and raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=45}} His father, Franjo, was a [[Croats|Croat]] whose family had lived in the village for three centuries, while his mother Marija, was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] from the village of [[Podsreda]]. The villages were {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} apart, and his parents had married on 21 January 1881. Franjo Broz had inherited a {{convert|10|acre|adj=on|order=flip}} estate and a good house, but he was unable to make a success of farming. Josip spent a significant proportion of his pre-school years living with his maternal grandparents at Podsreda, where he became a favourite of his grandfather Martin Javer\u0161ek. By the time he returned to Kumrovec to begin school, he spoke [[Slovene language|Slovene]] better than [[Croatian language|Croatian]],{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} and had learned to play the piano.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=46}} Despite his \"mixed parentage\", Broz identified as a Croat like his father and neighbours.{{sfn|Minahan|1998|p=50}}{{sfn|Lee|1993|p=9}}{{sfn|Laqueur|1976|p=218}}\n\nIn July 1900,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=46}} at the age of eight, Broz entered primary school at Kumrovec. He completed four years of school,{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} failing the 2nd grade and graduating in 1905.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}} As a result of his limited schooling, throughout his life Tito was poor at spelling. After leaving school, he initially worked for a maternal uncle, and then on his parents' family farm.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} In 1907, his father wanted him to emigrate to the United States, but could not raise the money for the voyage.{{sfn|West|1995|p=32}} \n\nInstead, aged 15 years, Broz left Kumrovec and travelled about {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip}} south to [[Sisak]], where his cousin Jurica Broz was doing army service. Jurica helped him get a job in a restaurant, but Broz was soon tired of that work. He approached a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[locksmith]], Nikola Karas, for a three-year apprenticeship, which included training, food, and [[room and board]]. As his father could not afford to pay for his work clothing, Broz paid for it himself. Soon after, his younger brother Stjepan also became apprenticed to Karas.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nDuring his apprenticeship, Broz was encouraged to mark [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] in 1909, and he read and sold ''Slobodna Re\u010d'' (''Free Word''), a [[Socialism|socialist]] newspaper. After completing his apprenticeship in September 1910, Broz used his contacts to gain employment in [[Zagreb]]. At the age of 18, he joined the Metal Workers' Union and participated in his first labour [[Demonstration (protest)|protest]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=6}} He also joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia]].{{sfn|Dedijer|1952|p=25}}\n\nHe returned home in December 1910.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=54}} In early 1911 he began a series of moves in search of work, first seeking work in [[Ljubljana]], then [[Trieste]], Kumrovec and Zagreb, where he worked repairing bicycles. He joined his first strike action on May Day 1911.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=6}} After a brief period of work in Ljubljana,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=54}} between May 1911 and May 1912, he worked in a factory in [[Kamnik]] in the [[Kamnik\u2013Savinja Alps]]. After it closed, he was offered redeployment to [[\u010cenkov]] in [[History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1867\u20131918)|Bohemia]]. \nOn arriving at his new workplace, he discovered that the employer was trying to bring in cheaper labour to replace the local Czech workers, and he and others joined successful strike action to force the employer to back down.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Ridley notes that since his death there have been stories written about this period in his life, some of which state that he married a Czech girl in 1912, and she bore him a son. According to Ridley, these stories are \"almost impossible to verify\".{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=55}}}}\n\nDriven by curiosity, Broz  moved to [[Plze\u0148]], where he was briefly employed at the [[\u0160koda Works]]. He next travelled to [[Munich]] in [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. He also worked at the [[Mercedes-Benz|Benz]] car factory in [[Mannheim]], and visited the [[Ruhr]] industrial region. By October 1912 he had reached [[Vienna]]. He stayed with his older brother Martin and his family, and worked at the Griedl Works before getting a job at [[Wiener Neustadt]].

After learning to ski during the winter of 1913 and 1914, Broz was sent to a school for [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCO) in [[Budapest]],{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} after which he was promoted to [[sergeant major]].

Broz was arrested for [[sedition]] and imprisoned in the [[Petrovaradin fortress]] in present-day [[Novi Sad]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=62}} Broz later gave conflicting accounts of this arrest, telling one biographer that he had threatened to desert to the Russians, but also claiming that the whole matter arose from a clerical error.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} A third version was that he had been overheard saying that he hoped the Austro-Hungarian Empire would be defeated.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=40}} After his acquittal and release,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=62\u201363}} his regiment served briefly on the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|Serbian Front]] before being deployed to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in early 1915 to fight against [[Russian Empire|Russia]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} Tito in his own account of his military service did not mention that he participated in the failed Austrian invasion of Serbia, instead giving the misleading impression that he fought only in Galicia, as it would have offended Serbian opinion to know that he fought in 1914 for the Habsburgs against them.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=40}} On one occasion, the [[Reconnaissance|scout]] [[platoon]] he commanded went behind the enemy lines and captured 80 Russian soldiers, bringing them back to their own lines alive. In 1980 it was discovered that he had been recommended for an award for gallantry and initiative in reconnaissance and capturing prisoners.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=41\u201342}} Tito's biographer, Richard West, wrote that Tito actually downplayed his military record as the Austrian Army records showed that he was a brave soldier, which contradicted his later claim to have been opposed to the Habsburg monarchy and his self-portrait of himself as an unwilling conscript fighting in a war he was opposed to.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=41}} Broz was regarded by his fellow soldiers as ''kaisertreu'' (\"true to the Emperor\").{{sfn|West|1995|p=43}}\n\nOn 25 March 1915,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|West gives the date as 21 March,{{sfn|West|1995|p=42}} and Ridley says 4 April}} he was wounded in the back by a [[Circassia]]n cavalryman's lance,{{sfn|Gilbert|2004|p=138}} and captured during a Russian attack near [[Bukovina]].{{sfn|Frankel|1992|p=331}} Broz in his account of his capture described it melodramatically as: \"...but suddenly the right flank yielded and through the gap poured cavalry of the Circassians, from Asiatic Russia. Before we knew it they were thundering through our positions, leaping from their horses and throwing themselves into our trenches with lances lowered. One of them rammed his two-yard, iron-tipped, double-pronged lance into my back just below the left arm. I fainted. Then, as I learned, the Circassians began to butcher the wounded, even slashing them with their knives. Fortunately, Russian infantry reached the positions and put an end to the orgy\".{{sfn|West|1995|p=42}} Now a [[prisoner of war]] (POW), Broz was transported east to a hospital established in an old monastery in the town of [[Sviyazhsk]] on the [[Volga]] river near [[Kazan]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} During his 13 months in hospital he had bouts of pneumonia and typhus, and learned Russian with the help of two schoolgirls who brought him Russian classics by such authors as [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]] to read.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}}{{sfn|West|1995|p=42}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=64}}\n{{stack|float=right|[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b.JPG|thumb|The Uspensko-Bogorodichny monastery, where Broz recuperated from his wounds|alt=a colour photograph of a brown multi-storey building]]}}\nAfter recuperating, in mid-1916 he was transferred to the Ardatov POW camp in the [[Samara Governorate]], where he used his skills to maintain the nearby village grain mill. At the end of the year, he was again transferred, this time to the [[Kungur]] POW camp near [[Perm]] where the POWs were used as labour to maintain the newly completed [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} Broz was appointed to be in charge of all the POWs in the camp.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=65}} During this time he became aware that the [[Red Cross parcel]]s sent to the POWs were being stolen by camp staff. When he complained, he was beaten and put in prison.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} During the [[February Revolution]], a crowd broke into the prison and returned Broz to the POW camp. A [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] he had met while working on the railway told Broz that his son was working in an engineering works in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], so, in June 1917, Broz walked out of the unguarded POW camp and hid aboard a goods train bound for that city, where he stayed with his friend's son.{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=66\u201367}} The journalist [[Richard West (journalist)|Richard West]] has suggested that because Broz chose to remain in an unguarded POW camp rather than volunteer to serve with the Yugoslav legions of the [[Serbian Army]], this indicates that he remained loyal to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and undermines his later claim that he and other Croat POWs were excited by the prospect of revolution and looked forward to the overthrow of the empire that ruled them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=43}}\n\nLess than a month after Broz arrived in Petrograd, the [[July Days]] demonstrations broke out, and Broz joined in, coming under fire from government troops.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=67}} In the aftermath, he tried to flee to [[Finland]] in order to make his way to the United States, but was stopped at the border.{{sfn|West|1995|p=44}} He was arrested along with other suspected Bolsheviks during the subsequent crackdown by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] led by [[Alexander Kerensky]]. He was imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] for three weeks, during which he claimed to be an innocent citizen of Perm. When he finally admitted to being an escaped POW, he was to be returned by train to Kungur, but escaped at [[Yekaterinburg]], then caught another train that reached [[Omsk]] in [[Siberia]] on 8 November after a {{convert|2000|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} journey.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=67\u201368}} At one point, police searched the train looking for an escaped POW, but were deceived by Broz's fluent Russian.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=67}}\n\nIn Omsk the train was stopped by local Bolsheviks who told Broz that [[Vladimir Lenin]] had seized control of Petrograd. They recruited him into an [[Red Guards (Russia)|International Red Guard]] that guarded the Trans-Siberian Railway during the winter of 1917 and 1918. In May 1918, the anti-Bolshevik [[Czechoslovak Legion]] wrested control of parts of Siberia from Bolshevik forces, and the [[Provisional Siberian Government (Omsk)|Provisional Siberian Government]] established itself in Omsk, and Broz and his comrades went into hiding. At this time Broz met a beautiful 14-year-old local girl, Pelagija \"Polka\" Belousova, who hid him then helped him escape to a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] village {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip}} from Omsk.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=71}} Broz again worked maintaining the local mill until November 1919 when the [[Red Army]] recaptured Omsk from [[White movement|White forces]] loyal to the [[Provisional All-Russian Government]] of [[Alexander Kolchak]]. He moved back to Omsk and married Belousova in January 1920.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|West states that the marriage occurred in mid-1919.{{sfn|West|1995|p=45}}}} At the time of their marriage, Broz was 27 years old and Belousova was 15.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=76}} Broz later wrote that during his time in Russia he heard much talk of Lenin, a little of Trotsky and \"...as for Stalin, during the time I stayed in Russia, I never once heard his name\".{{sfn|West|1995|p=45}} In the autumn of 1920 he and his pregnant wife returned to his homeland, first by train to [[Narva]], by ship to [[Szczecin|Stettin]], then by train to Vienna, where they arrived on 20 September. In early October Broz returned home to Kumrovec in what was then the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] to find that his mother had died and his father had moved to [[Jastrebarsko]] near Zagreb.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}} Sources differ over whether Broz joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] while in Russia, but he stated that the first time he joined the party was in Zagreb after he returned to his homeland.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=77}}\n\n==Interwar communist activity==\n===Communist agitator===\n[[File:Milorad Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 wiki photo.jpg|thumb|The assassination of the Minister of the Interior, Milorad Dra\u0161kovi\u0107, led to the outlawing of the Communist Party.|alt=black and white photograph of a male in formal attire]]\nUpon his return home, Broz was unable to gain employment as a metalworker in Kumrovec, so he and his wife moved briefly to Zagreb, where he worked as a waiter, and took part in a waiter's strike. He also joined the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (CPY).{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=77\u201378}} The CPY's influence on the political life of Yugoslavia was growing rapidly.

Sabi\u0107 contacted Broz who agreed to work illegally for the party, distributing leaflets and agitating among factory workers. In the contest of ideas between those that wanted to pursue moderate policies and those that advocated violent revolution, Broz sided with the latter. In 1924, Broz was elected to the CPY district committee, but after he gave a speech at a comrade's [[Catholicism|Catholic]] funeral he was arrested when the priest complained. Paraded through the streets in chains, he was held for eight days and was eventually charged with creating a public disturbance. With the help of a [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] prosecutor who hated Catholics, Broz and his co-accused were acquitted.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=80\u201382}} His brush with the law had marked him as a communist agitator, and his home was searched on an almost weekly basis. Since their arrival in Yugoslavia, Pelagija had lost three babies soon after their births, and one daughter, Zlatina, at the age of two. Broz felt the loss of Zlatina deeply. In 1924, Pelagija gave birth to a boy, \u017darko, who survived. In mid-1925, Broz's employer died and the new mill owner gave him an ultimatum, give up his communist activities or lose his job. So, at the age of 33, Broz became a professional revolutionary.{{sfn|West|1995|p=54}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=83\u201385}}\n\n===Professional revolutionary===\nThe CPY concentrated its revolutionary efforts on factory workers in the more industrialised areas of Croatia and Slovenia, encouraging strikes and similar action.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=87}} In 1925, the now unemployed Broz moved to [[Kraljevica]] on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, where he started working at a shipyard to further the aims of the CPY.{{sfn|Auty|1970|p=53}} During his time in Karljevica, Tito acquired a love of the warm, sunny Adriatic coastline that was to last for the rest of his life, and throughout his later time as leader, he spent as much time possible living on his yacht while cruising the Adriatic.{{sfn|West|1995|p=55}} \n\nWhile at Kraljevica he worked on Yugoslav [[torpedo boat]]s and a pleasure yacht for the [[People's Radical Party]] politician, [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]]. Broz built up the trade union organisation in the shipyards and was elected as a [[union representative]]. A year later he led a shipyard strike, and soon after was fired. In October 1926 he obtained work in a railway works in [[Smederevska Palanka]] near [[Belgrade]]. In March 1927, he wrote an article complaining about the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in the factory, and after speaking up for a worker he was promptly sacked. Identified by the CPY as worthy of promotion, he was appointed secretary of the Zagreb branch of the Metal Workers' Union, and soon after of the whole Croatian branch of the union. In July 1927 Broz was arrested, along with six other workers, and imprisoned at nearby [[Ogulin]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=56}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=88\u201389}} After being held without trial for some time, Broz went on a hunger strike until a date was set. The trial was held in secret and he was found guilty of being a member of the CPY. Sentenced to four months' imprisonment, he was released from prison pending an appeal. On the orders of the CPY, Broz did not report to the court for the hearing of the appeal, instead going into hiding in Zagreb. Wearing dark spectacles and carrying forged papers, Broz posed as a middle-class technician in the engineering industry, working undercover to contact other CPY members and co-ordinate their infiltration of trade unions.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito in prison 1928.jpg|thumb|left|Tito's [[mug shot]] after arrest for communist activities in 1928|alt=a series of three black and white head and shoulders photographs]]\n\nIn February 1928, Broz was one of 32 delegates to the conference of the Croatian branch of the CPY. During the conference, Broz condemned factions within the party. These included those that advocated a [[Greater Serbia]] agenda within Yugoslavia, like the long-term CPY leader, the Serb [[Sima Markovi\u0107]]. Broz proposed that the executive committee of the [[Communist International]] purge the branch of factionalism, and was supported by a delegate sent from Moscow. After it was proposed that the entire central committee of the Croatian branch be dismissed, a new central committee was elected with Broz as its secretary.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=95\u201396}} Markovi\u0107 was subsequently expelled from the CPY at the Fourth Congress of the [[Comintern]], and the CPY adopted a policy of working for the break-up of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=96}} Broz arranged to disrupt a meeting of the [[Yugoslav Social-Democratic Party|Social-Democratic Party]] on May Day that year, and in a melee outside the venue, Broz was arrested by the police. They failed to identify him, charging him under his false name for a breach of the peace. He was imprisoned for 14 days and then released, returning to his previous activities.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=96\u201397}} The police eventually tracked him down with the help of a police informer. He was ill-treated and held for three months before being tried in court in November 1928 for his illegal communist activities,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=98\u201399}} which included allegations that the bombs that had been found at his address had been planted by the police.{{sfn|West|1995|p=57}} He was convicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=101}}\n\n===Prison===\n[[File:Tito i Mo\u0161a Pijade u zatvoru.jpg|thumb|Tito (left) and his ideological mentor [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]] while in the Lepoglava jail|alt=a black and white photograph of two men]]\n\nAfter his sentencing, his wife and son returned to Kumrovec, where they were looked after by sympathetic locals, but then one day they suddenly left without explanation and returned to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=102\u2013103}} She fell in love with another man and \u017darko grew up in institutions.{{sfn|West|1995|p=59}} After arriving at [[Lepoglava prison]], Broz was employed in maintaining the electrical system, and chose as his assistant a middle-class Belgrade Jew, [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]], who had been given a 20-year sentence for his communist activities. Their work allowed Broz and Pijade to move around the prison, contacting and organising other communist prisoners.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=103\u2013104}} During their time together in Lepoglava, Pijade became Broz's ideological mentor.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|pp=36\u201339}} After two and a half years at Lepoglava, Broz was accused of attempting to escape and was transferred to [[Maribor]] prison where he was held in solitary confinement for several months.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=106}} After completing the full term of his sentence, he was released, only to be arrested outside the prison gates and taken to Ogulin to serve the four-month sentence he had avoided in 1927. He was finally released from prison on 16 March 1934, but even then he was subject to orders that required him to live in Kumrovec and report to the police daily.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=107\u2013108 & 112}} During his imprisonment, the political situation in Europe had changed significantly, with the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany and the emergence of right-wing parties in France and neighbouring Austria. He returned to a warm welcome in Kumrovec, but did not stay for long. In early May, he received word from the CPY to return to his revolutionary activities, and left his home town for Zagreb, where he rejoined the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=109\u2013113}}\n\nThe Croatian branch of the CPY was in disarray, a situation exacerbated by the escape of the executive committee of the CPY to Vienna in Austria, from which they were directing activities. Over the next six months, Broz travelled several times between Zagreb, Ljubljana and Vienna, using false passports. In July 1934, he was blackmailed by a smuggler, but pressed on across the border, and was detained by the local ''[[Heimwehr]]'', a paramilitary Home Guard. He used the Austrian accent he had developed during his war service to convince them that he was a wayward Austrian mountaineer, and they allowed him to proceed to Vienna.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=113}}{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=147}} Once there, he contacted the General Secretary of the CPY, [[Milan Gorki\u0107]], who sent him to Ljubljana to arrange a secret conference of the CPY in Slovenia. The conference was held at the summer palace of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana|Roman Catholic bishop of Ljubljana]], whose brother was a communist sympathiser. It was at this conference that Broz first met [[Edvard Kardelj]], a young Slovene communist who had recently been released from prison. Broz and Kardelj subsequently became good friends, with Tito later regarding him as his most reliable deputy. As he was wanted by the police for failing to report to them in Kumrovec, Broz adopted various pseudonyms, including \"Rudi\" and \"Tito\". He used the latter as a pen name when he wrote articles for party journals in 1934, and it stuck. He gave no reason for choosing the name \"Tito\" except that it was a common nickname for men from the district where he grew up. Within the Comintern network, his nickname was \"Walter\".{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=114\u2013115}}{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=151}}\n\n===Flight from Yugoslavia===\n[[File:Edvard Kardelj zatvorenik.jpg|thumb|left|Edvard Kardelj met Tito in 1934 and they became close friends|alt=two black and white mugshots]]\n\nDuring this time Tito wrote articles on the duties of imprisoned communists and on trade unions. He was in Ljubljana when [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] was assassinated by the Croatian nationalist ''[[Usta\u0161e]]'' organisation in Marseilles on 9 October 1934. In the crackdown on dissidents that followed his death, it was decided that Tito should leave Yugoslavia. He travelled to Vienna on a forged Czech passport where he joined Gorki\u0107 and the rest of the [[Politburo]] of the CPY. It was decided that the Austrian government was too hostile to communism, so the Politburo travelled to [[Brno]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], and Tito accompanied them.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=116\u2013117}} On Christmas Day 1934, a secret meeting of the Central Committee of the CPY was held in Ljubljana, and Tito was elected as a member of the Politburo for the first time. The Politburo decided to send him to Moscow to report on the situation in Yugoslavia, and in early February 1935 he arrived there as full-time official of the Comintern.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=117\u2013118}} He lodged at the main Comintern residence, the [[Hotel Lux]] on [[Tverskaya Street]], and was quickly in contact with [[Vladimir \u0106opi\u0107]], one of the leading Yugoslavs with the Comintern. He was soon introduced to the main personalities in the organisation. Tito was appointed to the secretariat of the Balkan section, responsible for Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=120}} Kardelj was also in Moscow, as was the Bulgarian communist leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}} Tito lectured on trade unions to foreign communists, and attended a course on military tactics run by the Red Army, and occasionally attended the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. He attended as one of 510 delegates to the [[Seventh World Congress of the Comintern]] in July and August 1935, where he briefly saw [[Joseph Stalin]] for the first time. After the congress, he toured the Soviet Union, then returned to Moscow to continue his work. He contacted Polka and \u017darko, but soon fell in love with an Austrian woman who worked at the Hotel Lux, Johanna Koenig, known within communist ranks as Lucia Bauer. When she became aware of this liaison, Polka divorced Tito in April 1936. Tito married Bauer on 13 October of that year.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nAfter the World Congress, Tito worked to promote the new Comintern line on Yugoslavia, which was that it would no longer work to break up the country, and would instead defend the integrity of Yugoslavia against Nazism and Fascism. From a distance, Tito also worked to organise strikes at the shipyards at Kraljevica and the coal mines at [[Trbovlje]] near Ljubljana. He tried to convince the Comintern that it would be better if the party leadership was located inside Yugoslavia. A compromise was arrived at, where Tito and others would work inside the country and Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo would continue to work from abroad. Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo relocated to Paris, while Tito began to travel between Moscow, Paris and Zagreb in 1936 and 1937, using false passports.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=122\u2013123}} In 1936, his father died.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}\n\n[[File:\u0160panski borci.jpg|thumb|Yugoslav volunteers fighting in the Spanish Civil War|alt=black and white photograph of men firing weapons]]\n\nTito returned to Moscow in August 1936, soon after the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=124}} At the time, the [[Great Purge]] was underway, and foreign communists like Tito and his Yugoslav compatriots were particularly vulnerable. Despite a laudatory report written by Tito about the veteran Yugoslav communist [[Filip Filipovi\u0107 (politician)|Filip Filipovi\u0107]], Filipovi\u0107 was arrested and shot by the Soviet secret police, the [[NKVD]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=126\u2013127}} However, before the Purge really began to erode the ranks of the Yugoslav communists in Moscow, Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia with a new mission, to recruit [[Yugoslav volunteers in the Spanish Civil War|volunteers]] for the [[International Brigades]] being raised to fight on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. Travelling via Vienna, he reached the coastal port city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in December 1936.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} According to the Croatian historian [[Ivo Banac]], the reason Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia by the Comintern was in order to purge the CPY.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} An initial attempt to send 500 volunteers to Spain by ship failed utterly, with nearly all the communist volunteers being arrested and imprisoned.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} Tito then travelled to Paris, where he arranged the travel of volunteers to France under the cover of attending the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris Exhibition]]. Once in France, the volunteers simply crossed the [[Pyrenees]] to Spain. In all, he sent 1,192 men to fight in the war, but only 330 came from Yugoslavia, the rest being expatriates in France, Belgium, the U.S. and Canada. Less than half were communists, and the rest were social-democrats and anti-fascists of various hues. Of the total, 671 were killed in the fighting and another 300 were wounded. Tito himself never went to Spain, despite later claims that he had. Between May and August 1937, Tito travelled several times between Paris and Zagreb organising the movement of volunteers and creating a separate [[League of Communists of Croatia|Communist Party of Croatia]]. The new party was inaugurated at a conference at [[Samobor]] on the outskirts of Zagreb on 1\u20132 August 1937.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=131\u2013133}}\n\n===General Secretary of the CPY===\nIn June 1937, Gorki\u0107 was summoned to Moscow, where he was arrested, and after months of NKVD interrogation, he was shot.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=134}} According to Banac, Gorki\u0107 was killed on Stalin's orders.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} West concludes that despite being in competition with men like Gorki\u0107 for the leadership of the CPY, it was not in Tito's character to have innocent people sent to their deaths.{{sfn|West|1995|p=63}} Tito then received a message from the Politburo of the CPY to join them in Paris. In August 1937 he became acting [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia|General Secretary of the CPY]]. He later explained that he survived the Purge by staying out of Spain where the NKVD was active, and also by avoiding visiting the Soviet Union as much as possible. When first appointed as general secretary, he avoided travelling to Moscow by insisting that he needed to deal with some indiscipline in the CPY in Paris. He also promoted the idea that the upper echelons of the CPY should be sharing the dangers of underground resistance within the country.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=134\u2013135}} He developed a new, younger leadership team that was loyal to him, including the Slovene Kardelj, the [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], and the [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]].{{sfn|West|1995|pp=63\u201364}} In December 1937, Tito arranged for a demonstration to greet the French foreign minister when he visited Belgrade, expressing solidarity with the French against Nazi Germany. The protest march numbered 30,000 and turned into a protest against the neutrality policy of the Stojadinovi\u0107 government. It was eventually broken up by the police. In March 1938 Tito returned to Yugoslavia from Paris. Hearing a rumour that his opponents within the CPY had tipped off the police, he travelled to Belgrade rather than Zagreb and used a different passport. While in Belgrade he stayed with a young intellectual, [[Vladimir Dedijer]], who was a friend of \u0110ilas. Arriving in Yugoslavia a few days ahead of the ''[[Anschluss]]'' between Nazi Germany and Austria, he made an appeal condemning it, in which the CPY was joined by the Social Democrats and trade unions. In June, Tito wrote to the Comintern suggesting that he should visit Moscow. He waited in Paris for two months for his Soviet visa before travelling to Moscow via Copenhagen. He arrived in Moscow on 24 August.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito's fake Canadian ID, 1939.jpg|thumb|Fake Canadian ID, \"Spiridon Mekas\", used for returning to Yugoslavia from Moscow, 1939]]\n\nOn arrival in Moscow, he found that all Yugoslav communists were under suspicion. Nearly all the most prominent leaders of the CPY were arrested by the NKVD and executed, including over twenty members of the Central Committee. Both his ex-wife Polka and his wife Koenig/Bauer were arrested as \"imperialist spies\", although they were both eventually released, Polka after 27 months in prison. Tito therefore needed to make arrangements for the care of \u017darko, who was fourteen. He placed him a boarding school outside [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], then at a school at [[Penza]], but he ran away twice and was eventually taken in by a friend's mother. In 1941, \u017darko joined the Red Army to fight the invading Germans.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=137}} Some of Tito's critics argue that his survival indicates he must have denounced his comrades as [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]. He was asked for information on a number of his fellow Yugoslav communists, but according to his own statements and published documents, he never denounced anyone, usually saying he did not know them. In one case he was asked about the Croatian communist leader Horvatin, but wrote ambiguously, saying that he did not know whether he was a Trotskyist. Nevertheless, Horvatin was not heard of again. While in Moscow, he was given the task of assisting \u0106opi\u0107 to translate the ''History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'' into [[Serbo-Croatian]], but they had only got to the second chapter when \u0106opi\u0107 too was arrested and executed. He worked on with a fellow surviving Yugoslav communist, but a Yugoslav communist of German ethnicity reported an inaccurate translation of a passage and claimed it showed Tito was a Trotskyist. Other influential communists vouched for him, and he was exonerated. He was denounced by a second Yugoslav communist, but the action backfired and his accuser was arrested. Several factors were at play in his survival; working class origins, lack of interest in intellectual arguments about socialism, attractive personality and capacity for making influential friends.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nWhile Tito was avoiding arrest in Moscow, Germany was placing pressure on Czechoslovakia to cede the [[Sudetenland]]. In response to this threat, Tito organised for a call for Yugoslav volunteers to fight for Czechoslovakia, and thousands of volunteers came to the Czechoslovak embassy in Belgrade to offer their services. Despite the eventual [[Munich Agreement]] and Czechoslovak acceptance of the annexation and the fact that the volunteers were turned away, Tito claimed credit for the Yugoslav response, which worked in his favour. By this stage, Tito was well aware of the realities in the Soviet Union, later stating that he \"witnessed a great many injustices\", but was too heavily invested in communism and too loyal to the Soviet Union to step back at this point.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=140\u2013141}} Tito's appointment as General Secretary of the CPY was formally ratified by the Comintern on 5 January 1939.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=135}}\n\nHe was appointed to the Committee and started to appoint allies to him, among them [[Edvard Kardelj]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] and [[Boris Kidri\u010d]].\n\n==World War II==\n{{See also|World War II in Yugoslavia}}\n\n===Resistance in Yugoslavia===\nOn 6 April 1941, [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces, with [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungarian]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] assistance, launched an [[invasion of Yugoslavia]].

In fact, Stalin and Tito had an uneasy alliance from the start, with Stalin considering Tito too independent.\n\nDuring the immediate post-war period Tito's Yugoslavia had a strong commitment to orthodox Marxist ideas. Harsh repressive measures against dissidents were common, including \"arrests, show trials, forced collectivisation, suppression of churches and religion\".{{sfn|Forsythe|2009|p=47}} As the leader of Yugoslavia, Tito displayed a fondness for luxury, taking over the royal palaces that had belonged to the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 together with the former palaces used by the House of Habsburg that were located in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|West|1995|p=196-197}} Tito's governing style was very monarchical, as his tours across Yugoslavia in the former royal train closely resembled the royal tours of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 kings and Habsburg emperors, and in Serbia he adopted the traditional royal custom of being a godfather to every 9th son.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Tito modified the custom by becoming a godfather to every 9th daughter as well after criticism was made that the practice was sexist.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Just like a Serbian king, Tito would appear wherever a 9th child was born to the family to congratulate the parents and give them a gift of cash.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Tito always spoke very harshly of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 kings in both public and private (through in private, he sometimes had a kind word for the Habsburgs), but in many ways he appeared to his people as a sort of king.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}}\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===Tito\u2013Stalin split===\n{{Main|Tito\u2013Stalin split}}\n[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt and Josip Broz Tito 1953.jpg|thumb|Josip Broz Tito greeting former U.S. first lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] during her July 1953 visit to Yugoslavia]]\n[[File:Resolucija VII. kongresa o prihodnjih nalogah ZKJ.jpg|thumb|Kardelj, Rankovi\u0107 and Tito in 1958]]\n[[File:Tito in Kumrovec, 1961.jpg|thumb|Josip Broz Tito visiting his birthplace [[Kumrovec]] in 1961]]\n\nUnlike other states in east-central Europe liberated by allied forces, Yugoslavia liberated itself from Axis domination with limited direct support from the [[Red Army]]. Tito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia had more room to follow its own interests than other Bloc leaders who had more reasons to recognise Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control. Although Tito was formally an ally of Stalin after World War II, the Soviets had set up a spy ring in the Yugoslav party as early as 1945, giving way to an uneasy alliance.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.at/books?id=J34leeCdXFQC&pg=PT120&lpg=PT120&dq=soviet+spy+ring+yugoslav+party+1945&source=bl&ots=dIXuH8A3Lq&sig=WWgnE0DnV6KfklOSYccGita4xHw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjoq7bWgb3fAhVHzKQKHQmsCu8Q6AEwDHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=soviet%20spy%20ring%20yugoslav%20party%201945&f=false|title=Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia|last=West|first=Richard|date=2012-11-15|publisher=Faber|isbn=9780571281107|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=12 The Quarrel with Stalin}}</ref>\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War II, several armed incidents occurred between Yugoslavia and the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]. Following the war, Yugoslavia acquired the Italian territory of [[Istria]] as well as the cities of [[Zadar]] and [[Rijeka]]. Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate [[Trieste]] into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies. This led to several armed incidents, notably attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on U.S. transport aircraft, causing bitter criticism from the West. In 1946 alone, Yugoslav air-force shot down two U.S. transport aircraft. The passengers and crew of the first plane were secretly interned by the Yugoslav government. The second plane and its crew were a total loss. The U.S. was outraged and sent an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government, demanding the release of the Americans in custody, U.S. access to the downed planes, and full investigation of the incidents.<ref>https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/89147/RICE0184.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt the USSR unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II and at the time when U.S. had operational nuclear weapons whereas the USSR had yet to conduct its first test. In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the Communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]], while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill not to pursue Soviet interests there, although he did support the Greek communist struggle politically, as demonstrated in several assemblies of the UN Security Council. In 1948, motivated by the desire to create a strong independent economy, Tito modelled his economic development plan independently from Moscow, which resulted in a diplomatic escalation followed by a bitter exchange of letters in which Tito wrote that \"We study and take as an example the Soviet system, but develop it a different form\".<ref>https://schoolworkhelper.net/tito-stalin-dispute-1948-timeline-analysis-significance/</ref>\n\nThe Soviet answer on 4 May admonished Tito and the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (CPY) for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse them of being too proud of their successes against the Germans, maintaining that the Red Army had saved them from destruction. Tito's response on 17 May suggested that the matter be settled at the meeting of the Cominform to be held that June. However, Tito did not attend the second meeting of the [[Cominform]], fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. In 1949 the crisis nearly escalated into an armed conflict, as Hungarian and Soviet forces were massing on the northern Yugoslav frontier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800593,00.html|title=No Words Left?|work=Time Magazine|date=22 August 1949|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> An invasion of Yugoslavia was planned to be carried out in 1949 via the combined forces of neighbouring Soviet satellite states of Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania, followed by the subsequent removal of Tito's government. On 28 June, the other member countries of the Cominform expelled Yugoslavia, citing \"nationalist elements\" that had \"managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership\" of the CPY. The Hungarian and Romanian armies were expanded in size and, together with Soviet ones, massed on the Yugoslav border. The assumption in Moscow was that once it was known that he had lost Soviet approval, Tito would collapse; \"I will shake my little finger and there will be no more Tito,\" Stalin remarked.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laar |first=M. |year=2009 |title=The Power of Freedom.

This repression was not limited to known and alleged Stalinists, but also included members of the Communist Party or anyone exhibiting sympathy towards the Soviet Union. Prominent partisans, such as [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]] and [[Dragoljub Mi\u0107unovi\u0107]], were victims of this period of strong repression, which lasted until 1956 and was marked by significant violations of human rights.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SAyizpsg-Z8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Accommodating+National+Identity:+New+Approaches+in+International+and+Domestic+Law#v=onepage&q=Accommodating%20National%20Identity%3A%20New%20Approaches%20in%20International%20and%20Domestic%20Law&f=false |title=Accommodating National Identity: New Approaches in International and Domestic Law - Page 17|last=Tierney|first=Stephen |year=2000|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-411-1400-6|page=17}}<br />\"''Human rights were routinely suppressed...''\"</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Iz6pvc3YSr0C&pg=PA37&dq=tito+regime+human+rights#v=onepage&q=tito%20regime%20human%20rights&f=false|title=No More: The Battle Against Human Rights Violations - Page 37, D.

The facilities at Goli Otok were abandoned in 1956, and jurisdiction of the now-defunct political prison was handed over to the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]].\n\n[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Ho Chi Minh, Josip Broz Tito and Edvard Kardelj, Beograd, avgust 1957.jpg|thumb|left|Tito with North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] in Belgrade, 1957]]\n\nTito's estrangement from the USSR enabled Yugoslavia to obtain U.S. aid via the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA), the same U.S. aid institution that administered the [[Marshall Plan]]. Still, he did not agree to align with the West, which was a common consequence of accepting American aid at the time. After Stalin's death in 1953, relations with the USSR were relaxed, and Tito began to receive aid as well from the COMECON. In this way, Tito played East\u2013West antagonism to his advantage. Instead of choosing sides, he was instrumental in kick-starting the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which would function as a \"third way\" for countries interested in staying outside of the East\u2013West divide.<ref name=\"nonaligned-chief\" />\n\nThe event was significant not only for Yugoslavia and Tito, but also for the global development of socialism, since it was the first major split between Communist states, casting doubt on Comintern's claims for socialism to be a unified force that would eventually control the whole world, as Tito became the first (and the only successful) socialist leader to defy Stalin's leadership in the [[COMINFORM]]. This rift with the [[Soviet Union]] brought Tito much international recognition, but also triggered a period of instability often referred to as the [[Informbiro]] period. Tito's form of communism was labelled \"[[Titoism]]\" by Moscow, which encouraged purges against suspected \"Titoites'\" throughout the [[Eastern bloc]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n[[File:Tito i Hrushchov.jpg|thumb|Tito and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in [[Skopje]] after the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|1963 earthquake]]]]\n\nOn 26 June 1950, the National Assembly supported a crucial bill written by [[Milovan \u0110ilas]] and Tito regarding \"[[Workers' self-management|self-management]]\" (''samoupravljanje''), a type of cooperative independent socialist experiment that introduced [[profit sharing]] and [[workplace democracy]] in previously state-run enterprises, which then became the direct social ownership of the employees. On 13 January 1953, they established that the law on self-management was the basis of the entire social order in Yugoslavia. Tito also succeeded [[Ivan Ribar]] as the President of Yugoslavia on 14 January 1953. After Stalin's death, Tito rejected the USSR's invitation for a visit to discuss normalisation of relations between the two nations. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] visited Tito in Belgrade in 1955 and apologised for wrongdoings by Stalin's administration. Tito visited the USSR in 1956, which signalled to the world that animosity between Yugoslavia and USSR was easing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862216,00.html |title=Discrimination in a Tomb|work=Time |date=18 June 1956|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> However, the relationship would reach another low in the late 1960s.<ref name=\"Christman\">{{cite book |last1=Broz Tito |first1=Josip |last2=Christman |first2= Henry M. |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1970 |title=The Essential Tito |page=69}}<br />''\"The truth is that it is, at best, disloyal and unobjective behaviour towards our party and the country.

It has, for example, been given as one of the reasons for the [[Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial]] in Czechoslovakia, in which 14 high-level Communist officials were purged, with 11 of them being executed.

In 1961, Tito co-founded the movement with Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], India's [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Indonesia's [[Sukarno]] and Ghana's [[Kwame Nkrumah]], in an action called The Initiative of Five (Tito, Nehru, Nasser, Sukarno, Nkrumah), thus establishing strong ties with [[third world]] countries. This move did much to improve Yugoslavia's diplomatic position. Tito saw the Non-Aligned Movement as a way of presenting himself as a world leader of an important bloc of nations that would improve his bargaining power with both the eastern and western blocs.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} On 1 September 1961, Josip Broz Tito became the first [[Non-Aligned Movement#Secretaries-General|Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement]].\n\nTito's foreign policy led to relationships with a variety of governments, such as exchanging visits (1954 and 1956) with [[Emperor Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia, where a street was named in his honour. In 1953, Tito visited Ethiopia and in 1954, the Emperor visited Yugoslavia.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Tito's motives in befriending Ethiopia were somewhat self-interested as he wanted to send recent graduates of Yugoslav universities (whose standards were not up to those of Western universities, thus making them unemployable in the West) to work in Ethiopia, which was one of the few countries that was willing to accept them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} As Ethiopia did not have much of a health care system or a university system, Haile Selassie from 1953 onward encouraged the graduates of Yugoslav universities, especially with medical degrees, to come work in his empire.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Reflecting his tendency to pursue closer ties with Third World nations, from 1950 onward, Tito permitted Mexican films to be shown in Yugoslavia, where they become very popular, especially the 1950 film ''Un d\u00eda de vida'', which become a huge hit when it premiered in Yugoslavia in 1952.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=160}} The success of Mexican films led to the \"[[Yu-Mex]]\" craze of the 1950s-1960s as Mexican music become popular and it was fashionable for many Yugoslav musicians to don sombreros and sing Mexican songs in Serbo-Croatian.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=161-162}}       \n\nTito was notable for pursuing a foreign policy of neutrality during the [[Cold War]] and for establishing close ties with developing countries. Tito's strong belief in self-determination caused  the 1948 rift with Stalin and consequently, the [[Eastern Bloc]]. His public speeches often reiterated that policy of neutrality and co-operation with all countries would be natural as long as these countries did not use their influence to pressure Yugoslavia to take sides. Relations with the United States and Western European nations were generally cordial. \n\nIn the early 1950s, Yugoslav-Hungarian relations were strained as Tito made little secret of his distaste for the Stalinist [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] and his preference for the \"national communist\" [[Imre Nagy]] instead.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495}} Tito's decision to create a \"Balkan bloc\" by signing a treaty of alliance with NATO members Turkey and Greece in 1954 was regarded as tantamount to joining NATO in Soviet eyes, and his vague talk of a neutralist Communist federation of Eastern European states was seen as a major threat in Moscow.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495-496}} The Yugoslav embassy in Budapest was seen by the Soviets as a center of subversion in Hungary as they accused Yugoslav diplomats and journalists, sometimes with justification, of supporting Nagy.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=496-497}} However, when the revolt broke out in Hungary in October 1956, Tito accused Nagy of losing control of the situation, as he wanted a Communist Hungary independent of the Soviet Union, not the overthrow of Hungarian Communism.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} On 31 October 1956, Tito ordered the Yugoslav media to stop praising Nagy and he quietly supported the Soviet intervention on 4 November to end the revolt in Hungary, as he believed that a Hungary ruled by anti-communists would pursue irredentist claims against Yugoslavia, just had been the case during the interwar period.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} To escape from the Soviets, Nagy fled to the Yugoslav embassy, where Tito granted him asylum.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=501}} On 5 November 1956, Soviet tanks shelled the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest, killing the Yugoslav cultural attache and several other diplomats.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Tito's refusal to turn over Nagy, despite increasingly shrill Soviet demands that he do so, served his purposes well with relations with the Western states, as he was presented in the Western media as the \"good communist\" who stood up to Moscow by sheltering Nagy and the other Hungarian leaders.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=503-504}} On 22 November, Nagy and his cabinet left the embassy on a bus that was take them into exile in Yugoslavia after the new Hungarian leader, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] had promised Tito in writing that they would not be harmed.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Much to Tito's fury, when the bus left the Yugoslav embassy, it was promptly boarded by KGB agents who arrested the Hungarian leaders and roughly handled the Yugoslav diplomats who tried to protect them.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} The kidnapping of Nagy, followed by his subsequent execution, almost led to Yugoslavia breaking off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and in 1957 Tito boycotted the ceremonials in Moscow for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, being the only communist leader who did not attend the occasion.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505-506}}     \n\nYugoslavia had a liberal travel policy permitting foreigners to freely travel through the country and its citizens to travel worldwide,<ref name=\"Socialism of Sorts\"/> whereas it was limited by most Communist countries. A number{{quantify|date=October 2015}} of Yugoslav citizens worked throughout Western Europe. Tito met many world leaders during his rule, such as Soviet rulers [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]]; [[Egypt]]'s [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], Indian politicians [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Indira Gandhi]]; British Prime Ministers [[Winston Churchill]], [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]; U.S. Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]]; other political leaders, dignitaries and heads of state that Tito met at least once in his lifetime included [[Che Guevara]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Willy Brandt]], [[Helmut Schmidt]], [[Georges Pompidou]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Kim Il-sung|Kim Il Sung]], [[Sukarno]], [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], [[Suharto]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Gaddafi]], [[Erich Honecker]], [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]], [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] and [[Urho Kekkonen]]. He also met numerous celebrities.\n\nYugoslavia provided major assistance to anti-colonialist movements in the Third World. The Yugoslav delegation was the first to bring the demands of the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]] to the United Nations. In January 1958, the French navy boarded the Slovenija cargo ship off [[Oran]], whose holds were filled with weapons for the insurgents. Diplomat Danilo Milic explained that \"Tito and the leading nucleus of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] really saw in the Third World's liberation struggles a replica of their own struggle against the fascist occupants. They vibrated to the rhythm of the advances or setbacks of the FLN or [[Vietcong]].<ref name=mo>Au temps de la Yougoslavie anticoloniale</ref> \u00bb \n\nThousands of Yugoslav cooperants travelled  [[Guinea]] after its decolonisation and as the French government tried to destabilise the country. Tito also supported the liberation movements of the Portuguese colonies in Africa. He saw the murder of [[Patrice Lumumba]] in 1961 as the \"greatest crime in contemporary history\". The country's military schools hosted activists from [[Swapo]] (Namibia) and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania]] (South Africa). In 1980, the secret services of South Africa and Argentina planned to bring 1,500 anti-communist guerrillas to Yugoslavia.  The operation was aimed at overthrowing Tito and was planned during the Olympic Games period so that the Soviets would be too busy to react. The operation was finally abandoned due to Tito's death and while the Yugoslav armed forces raised their alert level.<ref name=mo />\n\nIn 1953, Tito traveled to Britain for a state visit and met with [[Winston Churchill]].

Tito had an especially close friendship with Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia who preached an eccentric mixture of monarchism, Buddhism, and socialism and like Tito wanted his country to be neutral in the Cold War.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=283}} Tito saw Sihanouk as something of a kindred soul who like him had to struggle to maintain his backward country's neutrality in face of rival power blocs.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=283}} By contrast, Tito had a strong dislike of President Idi Amin of Uganda whom he saw as a thuggish and possibly insane leader.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=284}}\n\nBecause of its neutrality, Yugoslavia would often be rare among Communist countries to have diplomatic relations with right-wing, [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] governments.

In his speech before the Federal Assembly he introduced 20 sweeping constitutional amendments that would provide an updated framework on which the country would be based. The amendments provided for a collective presidency, a 22-member body consisting of elected representatives from six republics and two autonomous provinces. The body would have a single chairman of the presidency and chairmanship would rotate among six republics. When the Federal Assembly fails to agree on legislation, the collective presidency would have the power to rule by decree. Amendments also provided for stronger cabinet with considerable power to initiate and pursue legislation independently from the Communist Party. [[D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107]] was chosen as the Premier. The new amendments aimed to decentralise the country by granting greater autonomy to republics and provinces. The federal government would retain authority only over foreign affairs, defence, internal security, monetary affairs, free trade within Yugoslavia, and development loans to poorer regions. Control of education, healthcare, and housing would be exercised entirely by the governments of the republics and the autonomous provinces.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903055-1,00.html|title=Tito's Daring Experiment|work=Time |date=9 August 1971|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nTito's greatest strength, in the eyes of the western communists,<ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Laurence |title=Serbia |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |year=2010 |page=23 |isbn=978-1841623269}}</ref> had been in suppressing nationalist insurrections and maintaining unity throughout the country.

Tito was just shy of his 60th birthday, while she was 27, when they finally married in April 1952, with state security chief [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] as the best man. Their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since Tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante Ivan Krajacic brought her in originally. At that time, she was in her early 20s and Tito objected to her energetic personality. Not one to be discouraged easily, Jovanka continued working at [[Beli Dvor]], where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance. Their relationship was not a happy one, however. It had gone through many, often public, ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' by the latter pair. Certain unofficial reports suggest Tito and Jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s, shortly before his death. However, during Tito's funeral she was officially present as his wife, and later claimed rights for inheritance. The couple did not have any children.\n\nTito's grandchildren include [[Sa\u0161a Broz]], a theatre director in Croatia; [[Svetlana Broz]], a cardiologist and writer in Bosnia-Herzegovina; and [[Josip Broz Jo\u0161ka|Josip Broz \u2013 Jo\u0161ka]], [[Edvard Broz]] and [[Natali Klasevski]], an artisan of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nAs the [[President of Yugoslavia|President]], Tito had access to extensive (state-owned) property associated with the office, and maintained a lavish lifestyle. In Belgrade he resided in the official residence, the [[Beli dvor]], and maintained a separate private home. The [[Brijuni islands]] were the site of the State Summer Residence from 1949 on. The pavilion was designed by [[Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik]], and included a zoo. Close to 100 foreign heads of state were to visit Tito at the island residence, along with film stars such as [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Carlo Ponti]], and [[Gina Lollobrigida]].\n\nAnother residence was maintained at [[Lake Bled]], while the grounds at [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evo (Ba\u010dka Palanka)|Kara\u0111or\u0111evo]] were the site of \"diplomatic hunts\".

The hypothesis that \"a non-Yugoslav, perhaps a Russian or a Pole\" assumed Tito's identity was included with a note that this had happened during or before the Second World War.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Is Yugoslav President Tito Really a Yugoslav?|journal=Cryptologic Spectrum|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/is_yugoslav.pdf|id=(b) (3)-P.L. 86-36|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511130906/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/is_yugoslav.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The report notes [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]'s impressions of Tito's Russian origins after he had personally spoken with Tito.\n\nHowever, the NSA's report was completely invalidated by Croatian experts.

For instance, if someone working with me was arrested, and flogged into revealing my real name, the police would easily trace me. But the police never knew the real person hiding behind an assumed name, such as I had in the Party. Naturally, even the assumed names often had to be changed. Even before going to prison I had taken the name of Gligorijevi\u0107, and of Zagorac, meaning the 'man from Zagorje'. I even signed a few newspaper articles with the second.\n\nNow I had to take a new name. I adopted first the name of Rudi, but another comrade had the same name and so I was obliged to change it, adopting the name Tito. I hardly ever used Tito at first; I assumed it exclusively in 1938, when I began to sign articles with it. Why did I take this name 'Tito' and has it special significance? I took it as I would have any other, because it occurred to me at the moment. Apart from that, this name is quite frequent in my native district. The best-known Zagorje writer of the late eighteenth century was called [[Titu\u0161 Brezova\u010dki|Tito Brezova\u010dki]]; his witty comedies are still given in the Croatian theatre after more than a hundred years. The father of [[Ksaver \u0160andor Gjalski]], one of the greatest Croatian writers, was also called Tito.<ref>Dedijer, p. 81</ref>}}\n\n==Awards and decorations==\n{{main|Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito}}\nJosip Broz Tito received a total of 119 awards and decorations from 60 countries around the world (59 countries and Yugoslavia). 21 decorations were from [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] itself, 18 having been awarded once, and the [[Order of the National Hero]] on three occasions. Of the 98 international awards and decorations, 92 were received once, and three on two occasions ([[Order of the White Lion]], [[Order of Polonia Restituta|Polonia Restituta]], and [[Order of Karl Marx|Karl Marx]]). The most notable awards included the French [[Legion of Honour]] and [[National Order of Merit (France)|National Order of Merit]], the British [[Order of the Bath]], the Soviet [[Order of Lenin]], the Japanese [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], the West German [[Federal Cross of Merit]], and the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Order of Merit of Italy]].\n\nThe decorations were seldom displayed, however. After the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] of 1948 and his inauguration as president in 1953, Tito rarely wore his uniform except when present in a military function, and then (with rare exception) only wore his Yugoslav ribbons for obvious practical reasons. The awards were displayed in full number only at his funeral in 1980.<ref name=\"Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom\">{{cite book|last1=Badurina|first1=Berislav|last2=Sara\u010devi\u0107|first2=Sead|last3=Grobenski|first3=Valent|last4=Eterovi\u0107|first4=Ivo|last5=Tudor|first5=Mladen|title=Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom|publisher=Vjesnik|year=1980|page=102}}</ref> Tito's reputation as one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders of [[World War II]], along with his diplomatic position as the founder of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], was primarily the cause of the favourable international recognition.<ref name=\"Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom\"/>\n\n===Domestic awards===\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}} {{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}} {{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Yugoslavian Great Star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Orden slobode.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Hero of socialist labour Rib.png|width=104}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the National liberation Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Battle flag Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Orden jugoslovenske zastave1(traka).png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the partisan star with golden wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order Republic Golden wreath RIB.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of merits for the people with golden star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the brotherhood and unity with golden wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the National army with laurer wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of military merits with the great star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order for courageousness Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=Commemorative Medal of the Partisans - 1941 RIB.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=10 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=20 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=30 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=30 Years of the Victory over Fascism Medal RIB.png|width=106}}\n|}\n</center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!1st Row\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Order of the People's Hero]] {{smallsup|a}}\n|-\n!2nd Row\n|[[Order of the Yugoslav Star|Order of the Yugoslav Great Star]]\n|[[Order of Freedom (Yugoslavia)|Order of Freedom]]\n|[[Order of the Hero of Socialist Labour]]\n|[[Order of National Liberation]]\n|[[Order of the War Flag]]\n|[[Order of the Yugoslav Flag with Sash]]\n|-\n!3rd Row\n|[[Order of the Partisan Star with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of the Republic with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of People's Merit]]\n|[[Order of Brotherhood and Unity with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of the People's Army with Laurel Wreath]]\n|[[Order of Military Merit with Great Star]]\n|-\n!4th Row\n|[[Order of Courage (Yugoslavia)|Order of Courage]]\n|[[Commemorative Medal of the Partisans - 1941]]\n|[[10 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[20 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[30 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[30 Years of the Victory over Fascism Medal]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"7\"| '''<small>Note 1:</small> <sup>a</sup>'''<small>Awarded 3 times.</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"7\"| '''<small>Note 2:</small>''' <small>All Yugoslav decorations are now defunct.</small>\n|}\n\n===Foreign awards===\nHere follows a short list including some of the more notable foreign awards and decorations of Tito.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Award or decoration\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Place\n! style=\"width:500px;\"| Note\n!

For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information.

Conventional names give no information about the nature of each coefficient, or give misleading information (e.g., composite reliability). Conventional names are inconsistent. Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person. While one formula is referred to by multiple names, multiple formulas are referred to by one notation (e.g., alphas and omegas).

However, this interpretation overlooks the fact that <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> underestimes reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. At the population level, the maximum of all possible <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> values is closer to reliability than the average of all possible <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> values.<ref name=ChoKim/> This mathematical fact was already known even before the publication of Cronbach (1951).<ref name=Guttman>Guttman, L.

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson Formula 20, or KR-20. They dealt with cases where the observed scores were dichotomous (e.g., correct or incorrect), so the expression of KR-20 is slightly different from the conventional formula of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to. Let <math>p_i</math> denote the correct answer ratio of item <math>i </math>, and <math>q_i</math> denote the incorrect answer ratio of item <math>i</math> (<math>p_i + q_i = 1 </math>). The formula of KR-20 is as follows.\n</br><math>{\\rho}_{KR-20} = {{k} \\over {k-1} } \\left(1 - {{\\sum_{i=1}^k p_i q_i}\\over {\\sigma^2_X}} \\right)</math>\n\nSince <math>p_i q_i = \\sigma^2 _i</math>, KR-20 and <math>\\rho_{T}</math> have the same meaning.\n\n===Between 1937 and 1951===\n==== Several studies published the general formula of KR-20 ====\nKuder and Richardson (1937) made unnecessary assumptions to derive <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Several studies have derived <math> \\rho_{T}</math> in a different way from Kuder and Richardson (1937). \n\nHoyt (1941)<ref name = Hoyt> Hoyt, C. (1941).

[[Louis Guttman]] proved that all of these formulas were always less than or equal to reliability, and based on these characteristics, he referred to these formulas as 'lower bounds of reliability'.

He proved that <math> \\lambda_2 </math> is always greater than or equal to <math> \\lambda_3 </math> (i.e., more accurate).

The assumption he used is essential tau-equivalence in modern terms.\n\n====Recognition of  KR-20's original formula and general formula at the time====\nThe two formulas were recognized to be exactly identical, and the expression of general formula of KR-20 was not used. Hoyt<ref name = Hoyt/> explained that his method \"gives precisely the same result\" as KR-20 (p.156). Jackson and Ferguson<ref name = JF/> stated that the two formulas are \"identical\"(p.74). Guttman<ref name = Guttman/> said <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is \"algebraically identical\" to KR-20 (p.275). Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L.

Journal of Educational Psychology, 34(8), 485\u2013494. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0058608</ref>\n\n====Criticism of underestimation of KR-20====\nDevelopers<ref name=KR/> of this formula reported that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> consistently underestimates reliability. Hoyt<ref name=Hoyt2>Hoyt, C. J. (1941). Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

Psychometrika, 32(1), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400</ref> proved the necessary and sufficient condition for <math>\\rho_{T}</math> to be equal to reliability, and named it the condition of being essentially tau-equivalent.\n\nCronbach (1978)<ref name = c1978/> mentioned that the reason Cronbach (1951) received a lot of citations was \"mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient\"(p.263)<ref name = Cho />. He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1.

Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two.

This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality.

C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not.

If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha.

The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory.

Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991).

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. For example, <math>\\rho_{C}</math> is .02 larger than <math>\\rho_{T}</math> on average.<ref name=PK/>\n==Which reliability coefficient to use==\n===Should we continue to use tau-equivalent reliability?===\n<math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> is used in an overwhelming proportion.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't know the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items.

Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person.

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson Formula 20, or KR-20. They dealt with cases where the observed scores were dichotomous (e.g., correct or incorrect), so the expression of KR-20 is slightly different from the conventional formula of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to. Let <math>p_i</math> denote the correct answer ratio of item <math>i </math>, and <math>q_i</math> denote the incorrect answer ratio of item <math>i</math> (<math>p_i + q_i = 1 </math>).

Guttman<ref name = Guttman/> said <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is \"algebraically identical\" to KR-20 (p.275). Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L.

Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent.

This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality.

C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales?

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. For example, <math>\\rho_{C}</math> is .02 larger than <math>\\rho_{T}</math> on average.<ref name=PK/>\n==Which reliability coefficient to use==\n===Should we continue to use tau-equivalent reliability?===\n<math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> is used in an overwhelming proportion. A study estimates that approximately 97% of studies use <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> as a reliability coefficient<ref name = Cho/>. \n\nHowever, simulation studies comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients have led to the common result that <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> is an inaccurate reliability coefficient.<ref name=KTD>Kamata, A., Turhan, A., & Darandari, E.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't know the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items.

Argonne and a number of other AEC contractors built a total of 52 reactors at the National Reactor Testing Station. Two were never operated; except for the Neutron Radiography Facility, all the other reactors were shut down by 2000.\n\nIn the early afternoon of December 20, 1951, Argonne director [[Walter Zinn]] and fifteen other Argonne staff members witnessed a row of four light bulbs light up in a nondescript brick building in the eastern Idaho desert. Electricity from a generator connected to [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I]] (EBR-I) flowed through them. This was the first time that a usable amount of electrical power had ever been generated from nuclear fission. Only days afterward, the reactor produced all the electricity needed for the entire EBR complex.<ref>[http://www.inl.gov/proving-the-principle/chapter_06.pdf Proving the Principle: Chapter 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515041839/http://www.inl.gov/proving-the-principle/chapter_06.pdf |date=2011-05-15}}</ref> One ton of natural uranium can produce more than 40 gigawatt-hours of electricity \u2014 this is equivalent to burning 16,000 tons of coal or 80,000 barrels of oil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.evs.anl.gov/uranium/guide/facts/|title=Uranium Quick Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=Depleted UF6 Management Information Network|access-date=}}</ref> More central to EBR-I's purpose than just generating electricity, however, was its role in proving that a reactor could create more nuclear fuel as a byproduct than it consumed during operation.

So, the Navy sent their \"man in Engineering\", then [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Hyman Rickover]], well known for his great technical talents in electrical engineering and propulsion systems in addition to his skill in project management, to the AEC to start the Naval Reactors project. Rickover's work with the AEC led to the development of the [[Pressurized Water Reactor]] (PWR), the first naval model of which was installed in the submarine {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}. This made the boat capable of operating under water full-time \u2013 demonstrating this ability by reaching the North Pole and surfacing through the [[Polar ice cap]].\n\n===Start of commercial nuclear power===\nFrom the successful naval reactor program, plans were quickly developed for the use of reactors to generate steam to drive turbines turning generators. In April 1957, the SM-1 Nuclear Reactor in Fort Belvoir, Virginia was the first atomic power generator to go online and produce electrical energy to the U.S. power grid. On May 26, 1958 the first commercial nuclear power plant in the United States, [[Shippingport Atomic Power Station]], was opened by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as part of his [[Atoms for Peace]] program. As nuclear power continued to grow throughout the 1960s, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] anticipated that more than 1,000 reactors would be operating in the United States by 2000.<ref>Parker, Larry and Holt, Mark (March 9, 2007).

Cost overruns were sometimes a factor of ten above original industry estimates, and became a major problem. For the 75 nuclear power reactors built from 1966 to 1977, cost overruns averaged 207 percent. Opposition and problems were galvanized by the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979.<ref name=\"fas12\"/>\n\nOver-commitment to nuclear power brought about the financial collapse of the [[Washington Public Power Supply System]], a public agency which undertook to build five large [[nuclear power plant]]s in the 1970s. By 1983, cost overruns and delays, along with a slowing of electricity demand growth, led to cancellation of two WPPSS plants and a construction halt on two others. Moreover, WPPSS defaulted on $2.25&nbsp;billion of [[municipal bonds]], which is one of the largest municipal bond defaults in U.S. history.

The radioactivity released as a result of the accident was almost entirely confined within the reinforced concrete containment structure. These containment structures, found at all nuclear power plants, were designed to successfully trap radioactive material in the event of a melt down or accident. At Three Mile Island, the containment structures operated exactly as it was designed to do, emerging successful in containing any radioactive energy. The low levels of radioactivity released post incident is considered harmless, resulting in zero injuries and deaths of residents living in proximity to the plant.\n\nDespite many technical studies which asserted that the probability of a severe nuclear accident was low, numerous surveys showed that the public remained \"very deeply distrustful and uneasy about nuclear power\".<ref>John Byrne and Steven M.

Many permitted reactors were never built, or the projects were abandoned. Those that were completed after Three Mile island experienced a much longer time lag from construction permit to starting of operations.

Another cause was a large increase in the capacity factor over that period. In 1978, nuclear power plants generated electricity at only 64% of their rated output capacity.

Both nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities must be decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses. After a cooling-off period that may last as long as a century, reactors must be dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for final disposal. The process is very expensive, time-consuming, dangerous for workers, hazardous to the natural environment, and presents new opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.<ref name=sov11/>\n\nThe total energy required for decommissioning can be as much as 50% more than the energy needed for the original construction. In most cases, the decommissioning process costs between US$300 million to US$5.6 billion. Decommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time-consuming. In the U.S. there are 13 reactors that have permanently shut down and are in some phase of decommissioning, but none of them have completed the process.<ref name=sov11>[[Benjamin K.

One of these methods is in situ decommissioning (ISD), which was implemented at the U.S. Department of Energy Savannah River Site in South Carolina for the closures of the P and R Reactors. With this tactic, the cost of decommissioning both reactors was $73 million. In comparison, the decommissioning of each reactor using traditional methods would have been an estimated $250 million. This results in a 71% decrease in cost by using ISD.<ref>https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/26-EFCOG%20Best%20Practice%20-%20SRS%20P%20and%20R%20Reactor%20Basins%20ISD%20Final.pdf</ref>\n\nThe number of nuclear power reactors are shrinking as they near the end of their life. \nIt is expected that by 2025 many of the reactors will have been shut down due to their age. \nBecause the costs associated with the constructions of nuclear reactors are also continuously increasing, this is expected to be problematic for the provision of energy in the country.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carmona|first1=M\u00f3nica|last2=Feria|first2=Julia|last3=Golpe|first3=Antonio A.|last4=Iglesias|first4=Jesus|title=Energy consumption in the US reconsidered.

Medical scientists were interested in the effect of radiation upon the fast-growing cells of cancer, and materials were given to them, while the military services led research into other peaceful uses.\n\nThe [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] encouraged private corporations to build nuclear reactors and a significant learning phase followed with many early partial [[core meltdown]]s and accidents at experimental reactors and research facilities.<ref name=bks/> This led to the introduction of the [[Price-Anderson Act]] in 1957, which was \"...an implicit admission that nuclear power provided risks that producers were unwilling to assume without federal backing.\"<ref name=bks>[[Benjamin K.

Argonne and a number of other AEC contractors built a total of 52 reactors at the National Reactor Testing Station. Two were never operated; except for the Neutron Radiography Facility, all the other reactors were shut down by 2000.\n\nIn the early afternoon of December 20, 1951, Argonne director [[Walter Zinn]] and fifteen other Argonne staff members witnessed a row of four light bulbs light up in a nondescript brick building in the eastern Idaho desert. Electricity from a generator connected to [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I]] (EBR-I) flowed through them. This was the first time that a usable amount of electrical power had ever been generated from nuclear fission. Only days afterward, the reactor produced all the electricity needed for the entire EBR complex.<ref>[http://www.inl.gov/proving-the-principle/chapter_06.pdf Proving the Principle: Chapter 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515041839/http://www.inl.gov/proving-the-principle/chapter_06.pdf |date=2011-05-15}}</ref> One ton of natural uranium can produce more than 40 gigawatt-hours of electricity \u2014 this is equivalent to burning 16,000 tons of coal or 80,000 barrels of oil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.evs.anl.gov/uranium/guide/facts/|title=Uranium Quick Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=Depleted UF6 Management Information Network|access-date=}}</ref> More central to EBR-I's purpose than just generating electricity, however, was its role in proving that a reactor could create more nuclear fuel as a byproduct than it consumed during operation.

So, the Navy sent their \"man in Engineering\", then [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Hyman Rickover]], well known for his great technical talents in electrical engineering and propulsion systems in addition to his skill in project management, to the AEC to start the Naval Reactors project. Rickover's work with the AEC led to the development of the [[Pressurized Water Reactor]] (PWR), the first naval model of which was installed in the submarine {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}. This made the boat capable of operating under water full-time \u2013 demonstrating this ability by reaching the North Pole and surfacing through the [[Polar ice cap]].\n\n===Start of commercial nuclear power===\nFrom the successful naval reactor program, plans were quickly developed for the use of reactors to generate steam to drive turbines turning generators. In April 1957, the SM-1 Nuclear Reactor in Fort Belvoir, Virginia was the first atomic power generator to go online and produce electrical energy to the U.S. power grid. On May 26, 1958 the first commercial nuclear power plant in the United States, [[Shippingport Atomic Power Station]], was opened by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as part of his [[Atoms for Peace]] program. As nuclear power continued to grow throughout the 1960s, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] anticipated that more than 1,000 reactors would be operating in the United States by 2000.<ref>Parker, Larry and Holt, Mark (March 9, 2007).

Cost overruns were sometimes a factor of ten above original industry estimates, and became a major problem. For the 75 nuclear power reactors built from 1966 to 1977, cost overruns averaged 207 percent. Opposition and problems were galvanized by the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979.<ref name=\"fas12\"/>\n\nOver-commitment to nuclear power brought about the financial collapse of the [[Washington Public Power Supply System]], a public agency which undertook to build five large [[nuclear power plant]]s in the 1970s. By 1983, cost overruns and delays, along with a slowing of electricity demand growth, led to cancellation of two WPPSS plants and a construction halt on two others. Moreover, WPPSS defaulted on $2.25&nbsp;billion of [[municipal bonds]], which is one of the largest municipal bond defaults in U.S. history.

The radioactivity released as a result of the accident was almost entirely confined within the reinforced concrete containment structure. These containment structures, found at all nuclear power plants, were designed to successfully trap radioactive material in the event of a melt down or accident. At Three Mile Island, the containment structures operated exactly as it was designed to do, emerging successful in containing any radioactive energy. The low levels of radioactivity released post incident is considered harmless, resulting in zero injuries and deaths of residents living in proximity to the plant.\n\nDespite many technical studies which asserted that the probability of a severe nuclear accident was low, numerous surveys showed that the public remained \"very deeply distrustful and uneasy about nuclear power\".<ref>John Byrne and Steven M.

Many permitted reactors were never built, or the projects were abandoned. Those that were completed after Three Mile island experienced a much longer time lag from construction permit to starting of operations. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission itself described its regulatory oversight of the long-delayed [[Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant]] as \"a paradigm of fragmented and uncoordinated government decision making,\" and \"a system strangling itself and the economy in red tape.\"<ref>quoted by US EPA Commissioner Kennedy, in [Decisions of the United States Environmental Protection Agency], v,1 p.490.</ref> The number of operating power reactors in the US peaked at 112 in 1991, far fewer than the 177 that received construction permits. By 1998 the number of working reactors declined to 104, where it remains as of 2013. The loss of electrical generation from the eight fewer reactors since 1991 has been offset by power uprates of generating capacity at existing reactors.<ref>US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/showtext.cfm?t=ptb0901 Table 9.1], Annual Review, 27 September 2012.</ref>\n\nDespite the problems following Three Mile Island, output of nuclear-generated electricity in the US grew steadily, more than tripling over the next three decades: from 255 billion kilowatt-hours in 1979 (the year of the Three Mile Island accident), to 806 billion kilowatt-hours in 2007.<ref>US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/showtext.cfm?t=ptb0802a Net electrical generation 1949\u20132011], September 2012.</ref>\nPart of the increase was due to the greater number of operating reactors, which increased by 51%: from 69 reactors in 1979, to 104 in 2007. Another cause was a large increase in the capacity factor over that period. In 1978, nuclear power plants generated electricity at only 64% of their rated output capacity. Performance suffered even further during and after Three Mile Island, as a series of new safety regulations from 1979 through the mid-1980s forced operators to repeatedly shut down reactors for required retrofits.<ref>US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/EIA_Nuclear_Outlook_94.pdf \"Operating and maintenance costs for nuclear power plants in the United States\"], ''World Energy Outlook 1994'', p.41.</ref> It was not until 1990 that the average capacity factor of US nuclear plants returned to the level of 1978.

This makes nuclear plants with once-through cooling susceptible to drought.<ref>Jordan Macknick, Robin Newmark, Garvin Heath, and KC Hallett, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies], US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, March 2011.</ref>\n\nOnce-through cooling systems, while once common, have come under attack for the possibility of damage to the environment.

Both nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities must be decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses. After a cooling-off period that may last as long as a century, reactors must be dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for final disposal. The process is very expensive, time-consuming, dangerous for workers, hazardous to the natural environment, and presents new opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.<ref name=sov11/>\n\nThe total energy required for decommissioning can be as much as 50% more than the energy needed for the original construction. In most cases, the decommissioning process costs between US$300 million to US$5.6 billion. Decommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time-consuming. In the U.S. there are 13 reactors that have permanently shut down and are in some phase of decommissioning, but none of them have completed the process.<ref name=sov11>[[Benjamin K.

One of these methods is in situ decommissioning (ISD), which was implemented at the U.S. Department of Energy Savannah River Site in South Carolina for the closures of the P and R Reactors. With this tactic, the cost of decommissioning both reactors was $73 million. In comparison, the decommissioning of each reactor using traditional methods would have been an estimated $250 million. This results in a 71% decrease in cost by using ISD.<ref>https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/26-EFCOG%20Best%20Practice%20-%20SRS%20P%20and%20R%20Reactor%20Basins%20ISD%20Final.pdf</ref>\n\nThe number of nuclear power reactors are shrinking as they near the end of their life. \nIt is expected that by 2025 many of the reactors will have been shut down due to their age. \nBecause the costs associated with the constructions of nuclear reactors are also continuously increasing, this is expected to be problematic for the provision of energy in the country.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carmona|first1=M\u00f3nica|last2=Feria|first2=Julia|last3=Golpe|first3=Antonio A.|last4=Iglesias|first4=Jesus|title=Energy consumption in the US reconsidered.

It is one of two airports in Sabah with immigration counters for international flights, the other being [[Kota Kinabalu International Airport]]. Tawau Airport serves the districts of [[Tawau]], [[Kunak]] and [[Semporna]] and is the nearest airport to the diving islands of [[Sipadan]], [[Mabul]] and [[Kapalai]], all of which are located in the latter district.\n\n==Old Airport==\nThe old Tawau Airport was located on Jalan Utara (Malay for 'Northern Road'), about {{Convert|2|mi|abbr=on}} outside Tawau. It was officially opened in 1968 by the then Transport Minister of Malaysia, [[Sardon Haji Jubir|Tan Sri Haji Sardon]]. It could only cater to small aircraft such as the [[Fokker 27]].\n\nBy the early 80s, the airport received its first Boeing 737 flight operated by Malaysia Airlines following the newly extended runway. In the 90s, the airport also witnessed regional international destinations to [[Tarakan]], [[Balikpapan]] and [[Makassar]] in Indonesia by [[Bouraq Indonesian Airlines]] and [[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]] due to the close socio-economic ties between Tawau and the main eastern Indonesian urban areas.\n\nOn 15 September 1995, [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 2133]], a flight from Kota Kinabalu operated by a Fokker 50 aircraft, touched down {{Convert|500|m|abbr=on}} before the end of the {{Convert|2200|m|abbr=on|0}}-long runway.

The airport's runway would need to be extended (or a new airport built) to safely accommodate larger aircraft. In view of this, the government announced plans to construct a new airport to be located in the Balung area, approximately {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on}} east of downtown Tawau along the [[Malaysia Federal Route 13 (Sabah)|Tawau \u2013 Semporna highway]].\n\n==Present==\nThe new Tawau Airport was opened to the public in December 2001. In 2003, it was officially opened by the then Transport Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr. [[Ling Liong Sik]]. With a capacity of over 1.4 million passengers per annum, it is the second largest airport in Sabah after Kota Kinabalu International Airport. AirAsia added an international destination to [[Changi Airport|Singapore]] in 2010 and to [[Kuching Airport|Kuching]] in the Malaysian state of Sarawak in 2018, although both were discontinued due to low passenger yields. In 2018, 1,642,171 passengers passed through the airport and there were 15,579 aircraft movements.<ref name=MAHB />\n\nAt present, Tawau Airport has a {{Convert|2685|x|47|m|abbr=on|0}}-long runway, namely runway 06/24. Runway 24 is equipped with Instrument Landing System (ILS). The {{frac|1|1|2}}-storey terminal building is equipped with two aerobridges. The airport can accommodate eight aircraft at any given time, and its car park can accommodate 500 vehicles. In addition, there is a police station opposite the terminal building.\n\nIn 2019, Tony Fernandes, the CEO of AirAsia Group is planning to connect Tawau with direct flight services to several cities in China, Korea, Japan and other Asean cities by 2020 due to its proximity with [[Tun Sakaran Marine Park]], [[Mabul]], [[Sipadan]] island, [[Maliau Basin]], [[Danum Valley]] and other major ecotourism sites in southeast Sabah.<ref>[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news/141859/international-airasia-flights-to-s-kan-and-tawau-early-next-year/ International AirAsia flights to S\u2019kan and Tawau early next year]</ref> The airport also witnessed an additional international destination from [[Bandar Seri Begawan]] by RB Link in November 2019 and followed by charter flights to [[Guangzhou]] by Hainan Airlines by 2020. Correlating with the development, the Sabah Tourism Board has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to promote both Royal Brunei Airlines and Tawau for its marketing campaign in the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news/143212/tawau-s-first-global-air-access-starts/ Tawau\u2019s first global air access starts]</ref>\n\nThe airport is also slated for a further expansion after recording 1.64 million passengers in 2018, overreaching its original capacity of 1.4 million users.

It is one of two airports in Sabah with immigration counters for international flights, the other being [[Kota Kinabalu International Airport]]. Tawau Airport serves the districts of [[Tawau]], [[Kunak]] and [[Semporna]] and is the nearest airport to the diving islands of [[Sipadan]], [[Mabul]] and [[Kapalai]], all of which are located in the latter district.\n\n==Old Airport==\nThe old Tawau Airport was located on Jalan Utara (Malay for 'Northern Road'), about {{Convert|2|mi|abbr=on}} outside Tawau. It was officially opened in 1968 by the then Transport Minister of Malaysia, [[Sardon Haji Jubir|Tan Sri Haji Sardon]]. It could only cater to small aircraft such as the [[Fokker 27]].\n\nBy the early 80s, the airport received its first Boeing 737 flight operated by Malaysia Airlines following the newly extended runway. In the 90s, the airport also witnessed regional international destinations to [[Tarakan]], [[Balikpapan]] and [[Makassar]] in Indonesia by [[Bouraq Indonesian Airlines]] and [[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]] due to the close socio-economic ties between Tawau and the main eastern Indonesian urban areas.\n\nOn 15 September 1995, [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 2133]], a flight from Kota Kinabalu operated by a Fokker 50 aircraft, touched down {{Convert|500|m|abbr=on}} before the end of the {{Convert|2200|m|abbr=on|0}}-long runway. While attempting a go-around, the aircraft crashed into a shantytown known as Kampung Seri Menanti.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-09-16/news/9509160526_1_shantytown-plane-overshoots-runway-tawau|title=Plane Overshoots Runway, Crashes, Killing 34 People|date=16 September 1995|accessdate=8 March 2014}}</ref> There were 34 fatalities, including two crewmembers.<ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19950915-0 Aircraft accident Fokker 50 9M-MGH Tawau Airport (TWU) on 15 Sep 1995]</ref> In October 2001, another Malaysia Airlines flight (this one operated by a Boeing 737-400) skidded off the runway without causing any injuries or fatalities.\n\nA survey found that the old Tawau Airport had one of the shortest runways in Malaysia. The airport's runway would need to be extended (or a new airport built) to safely accommodate larger aircraft. In view of this, the government announced plans to construct a new airport to be located in the Balung area, approximately {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on}} east of downtown Tawau along the [[Malaysia Federal Route 13 (Sabah)|Tawau \u2013 Semporna highway]].\n\n==Present==\nThe new Tawau Airport was opened to the public in December 2001. In 2003, it was officially opened by the then Transport Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr. [[Ling Liong Sik]]. With a capacity of over 1.4 million passengers per annum, it is the second largest airport in Sabah after Kota Kinabalu International Airport. AirAsia added an international destination to [[Changi Airport|Singapore]] in 2010 and to [[Kuching Airport|Kuching]] in the Malaysian state of Sarawak in 2018, although both were discontinued due to low passenger yields. In 2018, 1,642,171 passengers passed through the airport and there were 15,579 aircraft movements.<ref name=MAHB />\n\nAt present, Tawau Airport has a {{Convert|2685|x|47|m|abbr=on|0}}-long runway, namely runway 06/24. Runway 24 is equipped with Instrument Landing System (ILS). The {{frac|1|1|2}}-storey terminal building is equipped with two aerobridges. The airport can accommodate eight aircraft at any given time, and its car park can accommodate 500 vehicles. In addition, there is a police station opposite the terminal building.\n\nIn 2019, Tony Fernandes, the CEO of AirAsia Group is planning to connect Tawau with direct flight services to several cities in China, Korea, Japan and other Asean cities by 2020 due to its proximity with [[Tun Sakaran Marine Park]], [[Mabul]], [[Sipadan]] island, [[Maliau Basin]], [[Danum Valley]] and other major ecotourism sites in southeast Sabah.<ref>[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news/141859/international-airasia-flights-to-s-kan-and-tawau-early-next-year/ International AirAsia flights to S\u2019kan and Tawau early next year]</ref> The airport also witnessed an additional international destination from [[Bandar Seri Begawan]] by RB Link in November 2019 and followed by charter flights to [[Guangzhou]] by Hainan Airlines by 2020. Correlating with the development, the Sabah Tourism Board has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to promote both Royal Brunei Airlines and Tawau for its marketing campaign in the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news/143212/tawau-s-first-global-air-access-starts/ Tawau\u2019s first global air access starts]</ref>\n\nThe airport is also slated for a further expansion after recording 1.64 million passengers in 2018, overreaching its original capacity of 1.4 million users. With 19.4% growth in 2018, it is the fourth in terms of passenger growth in the country (after Kuala Lumpur, Kota Kinabalu and Penang International Airport).<ref name=\"theborneopost.com GZ\">https://www.theborneopost.com/2019/06/28/guangzhou-tawau-direct-flights-to-start-january-2020/</ref> The expansion is expected to commenced by the end of 2019 and will include upgrading existing facilities together with a better shopping experience.<ref name=\"theborneopost.com GZ\"/>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n[[File:Tawau Sabah TawauAirport-01.jpg|thumb|One of Tawau Airport's two [[aerobridge]]s, mainly used by Malaysia Airlines and Malindo Air.]]\n{{Airport-dest-list\n| [[AirAsia]] | [[Senai International Airport|Johor Bahru]], [[Kota Kinabalu International Airport|Kota Kinabalu]], [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Kuala Lumpur\u2013International]]\n| [[Malaysia Airlines]] | [[Kota Kinabalu International Airport|Kota Kinabalu]], [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Kuala Lumpur\u2013International]]\n| [[Malaysia Airlines]] <br>operated by [[MASwings]] | [[Sandakan Airport|Sandakan]], [[Juwata International Airport|Tarakan]]\n| [[Malindo Air]] | [[Kota Kinabalu International Airport|Kota Kinabalu]],<ref>[https://www.malindoair.com/promo/Hello-Tawau Hello Tawau]</ref> [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Kuala Lumpur\u2013International]] <ref>{{cite web |last1=Liu |first1=Jim |title=Malindo Air 1Q20 Domestic network addition |url=https://www.routesonline.com/news/38/airlineroute/288977/malindo-air-1q20-domestic-network-addition/ |website=Routesonline}}</ref>\n| [[RB Link]] <br>operated by [[Malindo Air]] for [[Royal Brunei Airlines]] | [[Brunei International Airport|Bandar Seri Begawan]]<ref>[http://www.bernama.com/state-news/berita.php?id=1788573 Royal Brunei now flies to Tawau]</ref>\n}}\n\n===Cargo===\n{{airport-dest-list\n|[[AsiaCargo Express]]|[[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Kuala Lumpur\u2013International]]}}\n\n==Traffic and statistics==\n\n===Traffic===\n{|class=\"toccolours sortable\" style=\"padding:0.5em;\"\n|+ '''Annual passenger numbers and aircraft statistics\n|-\n!

It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements, while in its upper section the name of the society superimposed on a white [[Convex set|convex section]], over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white silhouette of a [[Cattle|charging bull]] is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black [[Shield (heraldry)|old French shield]] and the charging bull is a symbol of the ''[[comune]]'' of Turin. There is also a black silhouette of a [[mural crown]] above the black spherical triangle's base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress.\n\n[[File:Juventus FC 2017 logo.svg|thumb|upright|100px|Juventus logo since 2017\u201318 season|100px]]\nIn January 2017, president Andrea Agnelli announced the most recent change to the Juventus badge, revealing a video showing the introduction of the new badge.

The \"old\" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means \"youth\" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The \"lady\" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed ''la Fidanzata d'Italia'' (the Girlfriend of Italy), because over the years it has received a high level of support from [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] immigrant workers (particularly from [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include; ''[La] Madama'' ([[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] for: Madam), ''i bianconeri'' (the black-and-whites), ''le zebre'' (the zebras){{efn|The zebra is Juventus' official mascot because the black and white vertical stripes in its present home jersey and emblem remembered the zebra's stripes.}} in reference to Juventus' colours. ''I gobbi'' (the hunchbacks) is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of ''gobbi'' dates to the fifties, when the ''bianconeri'' wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.<ref>{{cite news|first=Paolo|last=Granzotto|title=Juve, la Signora \"gobba\" che ci prova|newspaper=Il Giornale|date=16 June 2006|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|accessdate=21 December 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115183036/http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|archivedate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe official anthem of Juventus is ''Juve (storia di un grande amore)'', or ''Juve (story of a great love)'' in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician [[Paolo Belli]] composed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|language=Italian|url=http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|title=Paolo Belli: biografia e discografia|year=2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415185937/http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|archivedate=15 April 2013}}</ref> In 2016, a documentary film called ''Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story'' was produced by the [[La Villa brothers]] about Juventus.<ref>{{cite news|author=Daniele Solavaggione|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|title=Arriva \"Bianconeri \u2013 Juventus Story\"|newspaper=La Stampa|date=30 September 2016|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033345/http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|archivedate=20 February 2018}}</ref> On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a [[docu-series]] called ''[[First Team: Juventus]]'', which followed the club throughout the [[2017\u201318 Juventus F.C. season|season]], by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on [[Netflix]]; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|publisher=juventus.com|date=22 January 2018|title=First Team: Juventus FC coming to Netflix on February 16!|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072704/http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|archivedate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Stadiums ==\n{{Infobox venue\n|stadium_name=Juventus Stadium\n|nickname=\n|image=Juventus v Real Madrid, Champions League, Stadium, Turin, 2013.jpg\n|image_size = 245px\n|location=Corso Gaetano Scirea,<br>10151 Turin, Italy\n|broke_ground=1 March 2009\n|opened=8 September 2011\n|renovated=\n|owner=Juventus F.C.\n|operator=Juventus F.C.\n|cost=\u20ac155,000,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|title=L\u2019immobiliare Juve: dopo lo stadio ecco la Continassa|publisher=Gazzetta dello Sport|date=7 August 2015|accessdate=20 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309114149/http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|archivedate=9 March 2016}}</ref>\n|architect=Hernando Suarez,<br>Gino Zavanella,<br>Giorgetto Giugiaro\n|tenants=\n|seating_capacity=41,507 seated\n}}\n{{main|Juventus Stadium|Stadio Olimpico di Torino|Stadio delle Alpi|Stadio di Corso Marsiglia|Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I}}\nAfter the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the ''scudetto'') and in 1906, years in which it played at the [[Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I|Corso Re Umberto]].\n\nFrom 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles.

It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements, while in its upper section the name of the society superimposed on a white [[Convex set|convex section]], over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white silhouette of a [[Cattle|charging bull]] is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black [[Shield (heraldry)|old French shield]] and the charging bull is a symbol of the ''[[comune]]'' of Turin. There is also a black silhouette of a [[mural crown]] above the black spherical triangle's base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress.\n\n[[File:Juventus FC 2017 logo.svg|thumb|upright|100px|Juventus logo since 2017\u201318 season|100px]]\nIn January 2017, president Andrea Agnelli announced the most recent change to the Juventus badge, revealing a video showing the introduction of the new badge.

The \"old\" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means \"youth\" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The \"lady\" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed ''la Fidanzata d'Italia'' (the Girlfriend of Italy), because over the years it has received a high level of support from [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] immigrant workers (particularly from [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include; ''[La] Madama'' ([[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] for: Madam), ''i bianconeri'' (the black-and-whites), ''le zebre'' (the zebras){{efn|The zebra is Juventus' official mascot because the black and white vertical stripes in its present home jersey and emblem remembered the zebra's stripes.}} in reference to Juventus' colours. ''I gobbi'' (the hunchbacks) is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of ''gobbi'' dates to the fifties, when the ''bianconeri'' wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.<ref>{{cite news|first=Paolo|last=Granzotto|title=Juve, la Signora \"gobba\" che ci prova|newspaper=Il Giornale|date=16 June 2006|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|accessdate=21 December 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115183036/http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|archivedate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe official anthem of Juventus is ''Juve (storia di un grande amore)'', or ''Juve (story of a great love)'' in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician [[Paolo Belli]] composed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|language=Italian|url=http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|title=Paolo Belli: biografia e discografia|year=2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415185937/http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|archivedate=15 April 2013}}</ref> In 2016, a documentary film called ''Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story'' was produced by the [[La Villa brothers]] about Juventus.<ref>{{cite news|author=Daniele Solavaggione|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|title=Arriva \"Bianconeri \u2013 Juventus Story\"|newspaper=La Stampa|date=30 September 2016|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033345/http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|archivedate=20 February 2018}}</ref> On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a [[docu-series]] called ''[[First Team: Juventus]]'', which followed the club throughout the [[2017\u201318 Juventus F.C. season|season]], by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on [[Netflix]]; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|publisher=juventus.com|date=22 January 2018|title=First Team: Juventus FC coming to Netflix on February 16!|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072704/http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|archivedate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Stadiums ==\n{{Infobox venue\n|stadium_name=Juventus Stadium\n|nickname=\n|image=Juventus v Real Madrid, Champions League, Stadium, Turin, 2013.jpg\n|image_size = 245px\n|location=Corso Gaetano Scirea,<br>10151 Turin, Italy\n|broke_ground=1 March 2009\n|opened=8 September 2011\n|renovated=\n|owner=Juventus F.C.\n|operator=Juventus F.C.\n|cost=\u20ac155,000,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|title=L\u2019immobiliare Juve: dopo lo stadio ecco la Continassa|publisher=Gazzetta dello Sport|date=7 August 2015|accessdate=20 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309114149/http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|archivedate=9 March 2016}}</ref>\n|architect=Hernando Suarez,<br>Gino Zavanella,<br>Giorgetto Giugiaro\n|tenants=\n|seating_capacity=41,507 seated\n}}\n{{main|Juventus Stadium|Stadio Olimpico di Torino|Stadio delle Alpi|Stadio di Corso Marsiglia|Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I}}\nAfter the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the ''scudetto'') and in 1906, years in which it played at the [[Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I|Corso Re Umberto]].\n\nFrom 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles.

The first man tried was Charles Taylor, the Friendship student from New Jersey. Taylor was tried, found guilty, convicted, and sentenced to $100 fine or 30 days hard labor on the York County Prison Farm. The protesters' attorney, an African-American lawyer from Sumter named Ernest A. Finney, then asked the judge to let Taylor's trial be used as a basis for the other nine and the judge agreed. The other nine were then tried, found guilty, and sentenced to the same punishment. Taylor was concerned about possibly losing his athletic scholarship at Friendship, so with the assistance of the NAACP, he paid his bail and was released. The NAACP offered to pay the bail for the remaining nine protesters but they refused, and on February 2, they began serving out their 30-day sentences on the county prison farm. After beginning their sentence on the county farm, the nine protesters were quickly given the appellation \"Friendship Nine\" by the press, and the case became famous nationwide. Motorcades of other protesters and supporters converged on the prison, and members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) came to Rock Hill and demonstrated; they too were arrested, jailed and refused bail. Over the course of the next year further demonstrations and arrests followed in Rock Hill, as well as in other cities throughout the United States. Protesters across the country adopted the \"jail no bail\" policy implemented by the Friendship Nine, and served out their jail sentences rather than helping to subsidize a system that supported segregation and inequality.

The first man tried was Charles Taylor, the Friendship student from New Jersey. Taylor was tried, found guilty, convicted, and sentenced to $100 fine or 30 days hard labor on the York County Prison Farm. The protesters' attorney, an African-American lawyer from Sumter named Ernest A. Finney, then asked the judge to let Taylor's trial be used as a basis for the other nine and the judge agreed. The other nine were then tried, found guilty, and sentenced to the same punishment. Taylor was concerned about possibly losing his athletic scholarship at Friendship, so with the assistance of the NAACP, he paid his bail and was released. The NAACP offered to pay the bail for the remaining nine protesters but they refused, and on February 2, they began serving out their 30-day sentences on the county prison farm. After beginning their sentence on the county farm, the nine protesters were quickly given the appellation \"Friendship Nine\" by the press, and the case became famous nationwide. Motorcades of other protesters and supporters converged on the prison, and members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) came to Rock Hill and demonstrated; they too were arrested, jailed and refused bail. Over the course of the next year further demonstrations and arrests followed in Rock Hill, as well as in other cities throughout the United States. Protesters across the country adopted the \"jail no bail\" policy implemented by the Friendship Nine, and served out their jail sentences rather than helping to subsidize a system that supported segregation and inequality. These acts of heroism by the Friendship Nine and others helped to spur even larger protests like the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in August 1963 and the famous march from Selma to Montgomery in March 1965.
