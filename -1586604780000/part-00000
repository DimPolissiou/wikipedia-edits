It is the [[imaginary line]] on the spheroid, equidistant from its [[geographical pole|poles]], dividing it into [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere]]s.

[[Indonesia]] is the country straddling the greatest length of the equatorial line across both land and sea.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is derived from medieval Latin word ''aequator'', in the phrase ''circulus aequator diei et noctis,'' meaning 'circle equalizing day and night', from the Latin word ''aequare'' meaning 'make equal'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/equator|title=Definition of equator|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Equator monument.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Equator sign kenya.jpg\n| width2 = 125\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Left'': A monument marking the equator near the city of [[Pontianak, Indonesia]]<br />''Right'': Road sign marking the equator near [[Nanyuki]], [[Kenya]]\n}}\n\nThe [[latitude]] of the Earth's equator is, by definition, 0\u00b0 (zero [[degree (angle)|degrees]]) of arc. The equator is one of the five notable [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] on Earth; the other four are both [[polar circle]]s (the [[Arctic Circle]] and the [[Antarctic Circle]]) and both [[tropics|tropical circles]] (the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]). The equator is the only line of latitude which is also a [[great circle]]\u2014that is, one whose [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] passes through the center of the globe. The plane of Earth's equator, when projected outwards to the [[celestial sphere]], defines the [[celestial equator]].\n\nIn the cycle of Earth's [[season]]s, the equatorial plane runs through the Sun twice per [[year]]: on the [[equinox]]es in [[March equinox|March]] and [[September equinox|September]]. To a person on Earth, the Sun [[subsolar point|appears to travel above]] the equator (or along the celestial equator) at these times. Light rays from the Sun's center are [[perpendicular]] to Earth's surface at the point of [[Noon#Solar noon|solar noon]] on the equator.\n\n[[File:Equator Sao Tome.jpg|thumb|left|The equator marked as it crosses [[Ilh\u00e9u das Rolas]], in [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]]]]\n[[File:equator Line Monument, Macap\u00e1 city, Brazil.jpg|left|thumb|The Marco Zero monument marking the equator in [[Macap\u00e1]], [[Brazil]]]]\n\nLocations on the equator experience the shortest [[sunrise]]s and [[sunset]]s because the Sun's [[sun path|daily path]] is nearly perpendicular to the [[horizon]] for most of the year. The length of [[daylight]] (sunrise to sunset) is almost constant throughout the year; it is about 14 minutes longer than nighttime due to [[atmospheric refraction]] and the fact that sunrise begins (or sunset ends) as the upper limb, not the center, of the Sun's disk contacts the horizon.\n\nEarth [[equatorial bulge|bulges slightly]] at the equator; the \"average\" diameter of Earth is {{cvt|12750|km|mi}}, but the diameter at the equator is about {{cvt|43|km|mi}} greater than at the poles.<ref name=\"National\">{{cite web |url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/equator/?ar_a=1|title=Equator|author= |date= |work= |website=National Geographic - Education|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nSites near the equator, such as the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]], are good locations for [[spaceport]]s as they have a fastest [[rotational speed]] of any latitude, 460&nbsp;m/s.

A launching due east from a site on the equator could take advantage of the earth's maximum rotational velocity (460 meters per second) to achieve orbital speed. The more frequent overhead passage of the orbiting vehicle above an equatorial base would facilitate tracking and communications. Most important, an equatorial launch site would avoid the costly dogleg technique, a prerequisite for placing rockets into equatorial orbit from sites such as Cape Canaveral, Florida (28 degrees north latitude). The necessary correction in the space vehicle's trajectory could be very expensive - engineers estimated that doglegging a Saturn vehicle into a low-altitude equatorial orbit from Cape Canaveral used enough extra propellant to reduce the payload by as much as 80%. In higher orbits, the penalty was less severe but still involved at least a 20% loss of payload. |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Geodesy ==\n{{further|Earth ellipsoid|Reference ellipsoid}}\n\n===Precise location===\nThe precise location of the equator is not truly fixed; the true equatorial plane is perpendicular to the [[Axial tilt|Earth's spin axis]], which [[polar motion|drifts]] about {{convert|9|m|0}} during a year.

If it were really circular, the length of the equator would then be exactly 2\u03c0 times the radius, namely 40,075.0142 kilometres (24,901.4594&nbsp;mi). The [[GRS 80]] (Geodetic Reference System 1980) as approved and adopted by the IUGG at its Canberra, Australia meeting of 1979 has an equatorial radius of 6,378.137 kilometres (3,963.191&nbsp;mi). The [[WGS 84]] (World Geodetic System 1984) which is a standard for use in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], also has an equatorial radius of 6,378.137 kilometres (3,963.191&nbsp;mi). For both GRS 80 and WGS 84, this results in a length for the equator of 40,075.0167&nbsp;km (24,901.4609&nbsp;mi).\n\nThe [[geographical mile]] is defined as one [[arc-minute]] of the equator, so it has different values depending on which radius is assumed. For example, by WSG-84, the distance is {{convert|1855.3248|m}}, while by IAU-2000, it is {{convert|1855.3257|m}}. This is a difference of less than {{Convert|1|mm||spell=in}} over the total distance (approximately {{convert|1.86|km||disp=or}}).\n\nThe earth is commonly modeled as a [[sphere]] flattened 0.336% along its axis. This makes the equator 0.16% longer than a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] (a great circle passing through the two poles). The IUGG standard meridian is, to the nearest millimetre, {{convert|40007.862917|km}}, one arc-minute of which is {{convert|1852.216|m}}, explaining the [[International System of Units|SI]] standardization of the [[nautical mile]] as {{convert|1852|m}}, more than {{convert|3|m}} less than the [[geographical mile]].\n\nThe [[Sea level|sea-level]] surface of the Earth (the [[geoid]]) is irregular, so the actual length of the equator is not so easy to determine. ''[[Aviation week and space technology|Aviation Week and Space Technology]]'' on 9 October 1961 reported that measurements using the [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] IV-A satellite had shown the equatorial diameter from longitude 11\u00b0 West to 169\u00b0 East to be {{convert|1000|ft}} greater than its diameter ninety degrees away.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n== Equatorial countries and territories ==\n{{kml}}\n[[File:ECSundialGPS.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Global Positioning System|GPS]] reading taken on the equator close to the [[Quitsato Sundial]], at [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo|Mitad del Mundo]], [[Ecuador]]<ref name=\"Informe que determina la posici\u00f3n de la L\u00ednea Ecuatorial\">{{cite web|author=Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Militar de Ecuador|title=Memoria T\u00e9cnica de la Determinaci\u00f3n de la Latitud Cero|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/97475201/Documento-Posicionamiento-Reloj-Solar|date=24 January 2005|language=Spanish}}</ref>]]\nThe equator passes through the land of 11 [[country|countries]].

Regardless of the time of day (i.e. the [[Earth]]'s rotation on its axis), the [[North Pole]] will be dark, and the [[South Pole]] will be illuminated; see also [[arctic winter]]. In addition to the density of [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident]] light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]\nSeasons result from the tilt of the Earth's axis compared to the plane of its revolution around the Sun. Throughout the year the northern and southern hemispheres are alternately turned either toward or away from the sun depending on Earth's position in its orbit. The hemisphere turned toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer, while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter (see [[solstice]]).\n\nAt the [[equinoxes]], the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun rather than tilted toward or away, meaning that day and night are both about 12 hours long across the whole of the Earth.\n\nNear the equator, this means the variation in strength of solar radiation is different relative to the time of year than it is at higher latitudes: Maximum solar radiation is received during the equinoxes, when a place at the equator is under the [[subsolar point]] at high noon, and the intermediate seasons of spring and autumn occur at higher latitudes, and the minimum occurs during ''both'' solstices, when either pole is tilted towards or away from the sun, resulting in either summer or winter in both hemispheres. This also results in a corresponding movement of the equator away from the subsolar point, which is then situated over or near the relevant [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic]] [[Tropic of Capricorn|circle]]. Nevertheless, temperatures are high year round due to the earth's [[axial tilt]] of 23.5\u00b0 not being enough to create a low minimum midday [[Position of the Sun|declination]] to sufficiently weaken the sun's rays even during the solstices.\n\nNear the equator there is little temperature change throughout the year, though there may be dramatic differences in rainfall and humidity. The terms summer, autumn, winter and spring do not generally apply. Lowlands around the equator generally have a [[tropical rainforest climate]], also known as an equatorial climate, though cold ocean currents cause some regions to have [[tropical monsoon climate]]s with a [[dry season]] in the middle of the year, and the [[Somali Current]] generated by [[Monsoon of South Asia|the Asian monsoon]] due to continental heating via the high [[Tibetan Plateau]] causes [[Greater Somalia]] to have an arid climate despite its equatorial location.\n\nAverage annual temperatures in equatorial lowlands are around {{convert|31|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} during the afternoon and {{convert|23|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} around sunrise. Rainfall is very high away from cold ocean current upwelling zones, from {{convert|2500|to|3500|mm|abbr=on|round=5}} per year. There are about 200 rainy days per year and average annual sunshine hours are around 2,000. Despite high year-round sea level temperatures, some higher altitudes such as the [[Andes]] and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] have glaciers. The highest point on the equator is at the elevation of {{convert|4690|m|0}}, at {{coord|0|0|0|N|77|59|31|W|type:landmark_region:EC|name=highest point on the equator}}, found on the southern slopes of [[Volc\u00e1n Cayambe]] [summit {{convert|5790|m|0}}] in [[Ecuador]]. This is slightly above the [[snow line]] and is the only place on the equator where snow lies on the ground. At the equator the snow line is around {{convert|1000|m|ft}} ''lower'' than on [[Mount Everest]] and as much as {{convert|2000|m|ft}} lower than the highest snow line in the world, near the [[Tropic

It is the [[imaginary line]] on the spheroid, equidistant from its [[geographical pole|poles]], dividing it into [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere]]s. In other words, it is the intersection of the spheroid with the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] [[perpendicular]] to its axis of [[rotation]] and midway between its [[geographical pole]]s.\n\nOn [[Earth]], ''the equator'' is about {{cvt|40,075|km|mi}} long, of which 78.8% lies across water and 21.3% over land. [[Indonesia]] is the country straddling the greatest length of the equatorial line across both land and sea.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is derived from medieval Latin word ''aequator'', in the phrase ''circulus aequator diei et noctis,'' meaning 'circle equalizing day and night', from the Latin word ''aequare'' meaning 'make equal'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/equator|title=Definition of equator|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Equator monument.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Equator sign kenya.jpg\n| width2 = 125\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Left'': A monument marking the equator near the city of [[Pontianak, Indonesia]]<br />''Right'': Road sign marking the equator near [[Nanyuki]], [[Kenya]]\n}}\n\nThe [[latitude]] of the Earth's equator is, by definition, 0\u00b0 (zero [[degree (angle)|degrees]]) of arc. The equator is one of the five notable [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] on Earth; the other four are both [[polar circle]]s (the [[Arctic Circle]] and the [[Antarctic Circle]]) and both [[tropics|tropical circles]] (the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]). The equator is the only line of latitude which is also a [[great circle]]\u2014that is, one whose [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] passes through the center of the globe. The plane of Earth's equator, when projected outwards to the [[celestial sphere]], defines the [[celestial equator]].\n\nIn the cycle of Earth's [[season]]s, the equatorial plane runs through the Sun twice per [[year]]: on the [[equinox]]es in [[March equinox|March]] and [[September equinox|September]]. To a person on Earth, the Sun [[subsolar point|appears to travel above]] the equator (or along the celestial equator) at these times. Light rays from the Sun's center are [[perpendicular]] to Earth's surface at the point of [[Noon#Solar noon|solar noon]] on the equator.\n\n[[File:Equator Sao Tome.jpg|thumb|left|The equator marked as it crosses [[Ilh\u00e9u das Rolas]], in [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]]]]\n[[File:equator Line Monument, Macap\u00e1 city, Brazil.jpg|left|thumb|The Marco Zero monument marking the equator in [[Macap\u00e1]], [[Brazil]]]]\n\nLocations on the equator experience the shortest [[sunrise]]s and [[sunset]]s because the Sun's [[sun path|daily path]] is nearly perpendicular to the [[horizon]] for most of the year. The length of [[daylight]] (sunrise to sunset) is almost constant throughout the year; it is about 14 minutes longer than nighttime due to [[atmospheric refraction]] and the fact that sunrise begins (or sunset ends) as the upper limb, not the center, of the Sun's disk contacts the horizon.\n\nEarth [[equatorial bulge|bulges slightly]] at the equator; the \"average\" diameter of Earth is {{cvt|12750|km|mi}}, but the diameter at the equator is about {{cvt|43|km|mi}} greater than at the poles.<ref name=\"National\">{{cite web |url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/equator/?ar_a=1|title=Equator|author= |date= |work= |website=National Geographic - Education|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nSites near the equator, such as the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]], are good locations for [[spaceport]]s as they have a fastest [[rotational speed]] of any latitude, 460&nbsp;m/s. The added [[Delta-v|velocity]] reduces the fuel needed to launch spacecraft eastward (in the direction of Earth's rotation) to orbit, while simultaneously avoiding costly maneuvers to flatten [[inclination]] during missions such as the [[Apollo Program|Apollo moon landings]].<ref name=\"Moonport\">{{cite web |author1=William Barnaby Faherty |author2=Charles D.

A launching due east from a site on the equator could take advantage of the earth's maximum rotational velocity (460 meters per second) to achieve orbital speed. The more frequent overhead passage of the orbiting vehicle above an equatorial base would facilitate tracking and communications. Most important, an equatorial launch site would avoid the costly dogleg technique, a prerequisite for placing rockets into equatorial orbit from sites such as Cape Canaveral, Florida (28 degrees north latitude). The necessary correction in the space vehicle's trajectory could be very expensive - engineers estimated that doglegging a Saturn vehicle into a low-altitude equatorial orbit from Cape Canaveral used enough extra propellant to reduce the payload by as much as 80%. In higher orbits, the penalty was less severe but still involved at least a 20% loss of payload. |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Geodesy ==\n{{further|Earth ellipsoid|Reference ellipsoid}}\n\n===Precise location===\nThe precise location of the equator is not truly fixed; the true equatorial plane is perpendicular to the [[Axial tilt|Earth's spin axis]], which [[polar motion|drifts]] about {{convert|9|m|0}} during a year.

If it were really circular, the length of the equator would then be exactly 2\u03c0 times the radius, namely 40,075.0142 kilometres (24,901.4594&nbsp;mi). The [[GRS 80]] (Geodetic Reference System 1980) as approved and adopted by the IUGG at its Canberra, Australia meeting of 1979 has an equatorial radius of 6,378.137 kilometres (3,963.191&nbsp;mi). The [[WGS 84]] (World Geodetic System 1984) which is a standard for use in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], also has an equatorial radius of 6,378.137 kilometres (3,963.191&nbsp;mi). For both GRS 80 and WGS 84, this results in a length for the equator of 40,075.0167&nbsp;km (24,901.4609&nbsp;mi).\n\nThe [[geographical mile]] is defined as one [[arc-minute]] of the equator, so it has different values depending on which radius is assumed. For example, by WSG-84, the distance is {{convert|1855.3248|m}}, while by IAU-2000, it is {{convert|1855.3257|m}}. This is a difference of less than {{Convert|1|mm||spell=in}} over the total distance (approximately {{convert|1.86|km||disp=or}}).\n\nThe earth is commonly modeled as a [[sphere]] flattened 0.336% along its axis. This makes the equator 0.16% longer than a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] (a great circle passing through the two poles).

However, its island of [[Annob\u00f3n Province|Annob\u00f3n]] is {{convert|155|km|abbr=on}} south of the equator, and the rest of the country lies to the north.\n\n==Equatorial seasons and climate==\n{{Main|Seasons|Tropics|Effect of sun angle on climate}}\n[[File:seasons.svg|frame|right|<br/>Diagram of the seasons, depicting the situation at the December solstice. Regardless of the time of day (i.e. the [[Earth]]'s rotation on its axis), the [[North Pole]] will be dark, and the [[South Pole]] will be illuminated; see also [[arctic winter]]. In addition to the density of [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident]] light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]\nSeasons result from the tilt of the Earth's axis compared to the plane of its revolution around the Sun. Throughout the year the northern and southern hemispheres are alternately turned either toward or away from the sun depending on Earth's position in its orbit. The hemisphere turned toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer, while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter (see [[solstice]]).\n\nAt the [[equinoxes]], the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun rather than tilted toward or away, meaning that day and night are both about 12 hours long across the whole of the Earth.\n\nNear the equator, this means the variation in strength of solar radiation is different relative to the time of year than it is at higher latitudes: Maximum solar radiation is received during the equinoxes, when a place at the equator is under the [[subsolar point]] at high noon, and the intermediate seasons of spring and autumn occur at higher latitudes, and the minimum occurs during ''both'' solstices, when either pole is tilted towards or away from the sun, resulting in either summer or winter in both hemispheres. This also results in a corresponding movement of the equator away from the subsolar point, which is then situated over or near the relevant [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic]] [[Tropic of Capricorn|circle]]. Nevertheless, temperatures are high year round due to the earth's [[axial tilt]] of 23.5\u00b0 not being enough to create a low minimum midday [[Position of the Sun|declination]] to sufficiently weaken the sun's rays even during the solstices.\n\nNear the equator there is little temperature change throughout the year, though there may be dramatic differences in rainfall and humidity. The terms summer, autumn, winter and spring do not generally apply. Lowlands around the equator generally have a [[tropical rainforest climate]], also known as an equatorial climate, though cold ocean currents cause some regions to have [[tropical monsoon climate]]s with a [[dry season]] in the middle of the year, and the [[Somali Current]] generated by [[Monsoon of South Asia|the Asian monsoon]] due to continental heating via the high [[Tibetan Plateau]] causes [[Greater Somalia]] to have an arid climate despite its equatorial location.\n\nAverage annual temperatures in equatorial lowlands are around {{convert|31|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} during the afternoon and {{convert|23|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} around sunrise. Rainfall is very high away from cold ocean current upwelling zones, from {{convert|2500|to|3500|mm|abbr=on|round=5}} per year. There are about 200 rainy days per year and average annual sunshine hours are around 2,000. Despite high year-round sea level temperatures, some higher altitudes such as the [[Andes]] and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] have glaciers. The highest point on the equator is at the elevation of {{convert|4690|m|0}}, at {{coord|0|0|0|N|77|59|31|W|type:landmark_region:EC|name=highest point on the equator}}, found on the southern slopes of [[Volc\u00e1n Cayambe]] [summit {{convert|5790|m|0}}] in [[Ecuador]]. This is slightly above the [[snow line]] and is the only place on the equator where snow lies on the ground. At the equator the snow line is around {{convert|1000|m|ft}} ''lower'' than on [[Mount Everest]] and as much as {{convert|2000|m|ft}} lower than the highest snow line in the world, near the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] on [[Llullaillaco]].\n<div style=\"width:85%;\">\n{{Weather box|location = [[Macap\u00e1]], [[Brazil]] in South America\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C =

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] used their [[trireme]] vessels for ramming as well. In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], rams were largely unknown, as the lack of a [[keel]] and the flat shape of the [[junk (ship)|junk]]'s bow was not conducive to the build of an elongated underwater spur.\n\nThe ram's first recorded use in modern times between major warships, however, was in the [[American Civil War]], at the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]], when the armored [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] warship {{ship|CSS|Virginia}} rammed the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] frigate {{USS|Cumberland|1842|2}}, sinking her almost immediately.\n\nAnother significant success of the ram in wartime was at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|1866 battle of Lissa]], between [[Italy]] and [[Austria]]. The Italian ironclad ''Re d'Italia'' had been damaged aft by gunfire, and had no rudder. Lying helpless in the water, she was struck amidships by the Austrian ''Ferdinand Max'', the flagship of the Austrian Commander-in-Chief Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff|Tegetthoff]]. The Austrian ship retreated unharmed as the Italian vessel rolled over and sank.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Pacific]], the Peruvian ironclad {{ship||Huascar|ship|2}} repeatedly rammed the Chilean corvette {{ship||Esmeralda|1855|2}}, sinking the wooden steam- and wind-powered ship.\n\nDuring World War I, {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} rammed and sunk German submarine {{SMS|U-29|Germany|2|sub=y}}. This was an incidental use of the ship's bow, however. In 1918, the British [[troop ship]] [[RMS Olympic|HMT ''Olympic'']] rammed {{SMU|U-103}} in which the submarine sustained such heavy damage that its crew was forced to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] and abandon ship.\n\nIn World War II, naval ships often rammed other vessels, though this was often due to circumstances, as considerable damage could be caused to the attacking ship. The damage that lightly constructed [[destroyer]]s took from the tactic led to it being officially discouraged by the [[Royal Navy]] from early 1943, after {{HMS|Hesperus|H57|6}} was dry-docked for three months following sinking {{GS|U-357||2}} in December 1942 and {{HMS|Harvester|H19|6}} was torpedoed and sunk following damaging her propellers during the ramming of {{GS|U-444||2}} in March 1943. {{USS|Buckley|DE-51|6}} rammed {{GS|U-66|1940|2}}; and {{HMS|Easton}} rammed {{GS|U-458||2}}.\n\nOn 29 January 1943 the Japanese submarine {{Jsub|I-1|1924|2}} was rammed and wrecked by the [[New Zealand]] [[naval trawler]]s, {{HMNZS|Kiwi|T102|2}} and {{HMNZS|Moa|T233|2}} in shallow water at Kamimbo Bay, [[Guadalcanal]], during [[Operation Ke]]. The submarine of 2,135 tons was much larger and more heavily armed than the minesweeping trawlers of 607 tons each.\n\nOn 5 November 1942 the {{ship|Finnish submarine|Vetehinen}} rammed the Soviet submarine ''\u0429 305'' in the Sea of \u00c5land and sank it. ''Vetehinen'' was on a night patrol searching for Soviet submarines. A contact was found, and after confirmation of an enemy contact, ''Vetehinen'' launched a torpedo, which missed probably due being fired at too short distance. ''Vetehinen'' then opened fire with its deck guns and managed to damage the Soviet submarine, which by then had started an emergency dive. The captain of ''Vetehinen'', determined not to let the submarine escape, ordered his submarine to ram the other vessel, which at last was a success.\n\nDuring anti-submarine action, ramming was an alternative if the destroyer was too close to the surfaced submarine for her main guns to fire into the water. The tactic was used by the famous British anti-submarine specialist Captain [[Frederic John Walker]] from December 1941 to the end of the war.\n\nThe British destroyer {{HMS|Campbeltown|I42|6}} (formerly USS ''Buchanan'', supplied under [[Lend-Lease]]) was disguised as a German destroyer for the purpose of ramming the gates of the Normandie dry dock at [[St. Nazaire]] on 28 March 1942. This was to prevent the Normandie dock ever being used by the German battleship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}. It was the only dock on the Nazi-occupied Atlantic coast capable of repairing such a large vessel. The operation was a success, and a large explosive [[time bomb]] charge hidden in the bow of the ship exploded the next day, putting the dock out of commission for five years.\n\nOn Aug. 2, 1943, while returning from a \"[[Tokyo Express]]\" night reinforcement mission in the [[Solomon_Islands_campaign|Solomon Islands]], the Japanese destroyer ''[[Japanese_destroyer_Amagiri_(1930)|Amagiri]]'' spotted USN [[PT boats]] at a range of about 1,000 yards. Rather than open fire--and give away their position--the destroyer captain, Lieutenant Commander Kohei Hanami, turned to intercept and closed in the darkness at 30-knots.  [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|''PT-109'']] commanded by Lt. [[John F Kennedy]] was rammed and crushed by the slower less maneuverable Japanese destroyer.<ref>http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/05109.htm</ref> \n\nLt. Commander [[Gerard Broadmead Roope|Gerard Roope]], the captain of the [[G and H-class destroyer|G-class destroyer]] {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|6}}, was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for the 1940 ramming of the German cruiser {{Ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}} following a close-range action in bad weather off the Norwegian coast. More recent claims suggest that ''Admiral Hipper'' was actually attempting to ram ''Glowworm'' and the two ships simply collided.\n\nDuring the [[Cod Wars]] between Britain and Iceland, unarmed [[fishing trawlers]] found themselves opposed by Icelandic Coastguard vessels and converted trawlers. As well as [[Royal Navy]] coastguard vessels, Britain sent large, ocean-going [[tugboat|tugs]] and [[Frigate|frigates]] to protect them and there were numerous ramming incidents against both sides, sometimes with very serious consequences.\n\nIn 1988, two US naval ships, destroyer {{USS|Caron|DD-970|2}} and cruiser {{USS|Yorktown|CG-48|2}}, were lightly rammed by Soviet [[Mirka-class frigate|Mirka II]]-class light frigate (FFL 824) and [[Burevestnik-class frigate|Burevestnik]]-class frigate ''Bezzavetny'' (FFG 811) inside contested Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea, near the port of [[Foros, Ukraine|Foros]]. None of the ships involved suffered significant damage.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, the Venezuelan patrol boat [[Venezuelan patrol boat Naiguat\u00e1|''Naiguat\u00e1'']], rammed the cruise ship ''[[RCGS Resolute]]'' after failing to damage it with a volley of gunfire. The ''Naiguat\u00e1'' was badly damaged from striking the strengthened hull of the ''Resolute'', built to break ice, and she sank shortly afterwards.\n\n==Air warfare==\n{{main|Aerial ramming}}{{Unreferenced|section|date=November 2018}}\nRamming in air combat is a last-ditch tactic that was used when all else had failed. The ramming pilot could use his entire aircraft as a ram or he could try to destroy the enemy's controls using the propeller or wing to chop into the enemy's tail or wing. Ramming took place when a pilot ran out of ammunition, yet was still eager to destroy an enemy, or when his plane had already been damaged beyond saving. Most ramming occurred when the attacker's aircraft was economically, strategically, or tactically less valuable than the enemy's, such as by pilots flying obsolescent aircraft against superior ones or by single-engine aircraft against multiple-engine bombers. Defenders rammed more often than invaders.\n\nA ramming attack was not considered suicidal in the same manner as ''[[kamikaze]]'' attacks\u2014the ramming pilot stands a chance of surviving, though it was very risky. Sometimes, the ramming aircraft itself could survive to make a controlled landing, though most were lost due to combat damage or the pilot bailing out. Ramming was used in air warfare in the first half of the 20th century, in both [[World War]]s and in the interwar period. In the jet age, as air combat speeds increased, ramming occurred much less frequently\u2014the probability of successfully executing (and surviving) a ramming attack approached zero.\n\n==Ground warfare==\n\nIn World War II, at least one incident of a tank ramming an enemy tank has been reported.

In 1944, an Irish Guards [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] rammed a [[Tiger II]] during [[Operation Goodwood]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Daglish|pages=177\u0323-178}}</ref>\n\n==Siege warfare==\n{{main|Battering ram}}\n\n==Terrorism and vehicle ramming attacks==\n{{main|Vehicular assault as a terrorist tactic}}\nThe [[FBI]] describes \"vehicle ramming attacks\u2014using modified or unmodified vehicles\u2014against crowds, buildings, and other vehicles.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation|title=DHS-FBI Warning: Terrorist Use of Vehicle Ramming Tactics|url=https://publicintelligence.net/ufouo-dhs-fbi-warning-terrorist-use-of-vehicle-ramming-tactics/|website=Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> Such attacks are often carried out by [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone-wolf terrorists]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Staff|title=Background: Ramming terror attacks in recent years|url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Background-Ramming-terror-attacks-in-recent-years|accessdate=7 September 2014|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=2011-08-29}}</ref> Examples of ramming attacks as acts of political terrorism include the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[2014 Jerusalem tractor attack]], the [[2006 UNC SUV attack]], the [[2008 Jerusalem bulldozer attack]], and the [[2008 Jerusalem vehicular attack]].\n\n[[Ram-raiding]] is sometimes used by criminals to breach shops to steal cash or merchandise.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n* Hardesty, Von.
