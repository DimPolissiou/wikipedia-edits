Millership made his name as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre back|centre-half]] but he originally was a [[Striker (association football)|centre forward]] in his early playing days.\n\n==Early days==\nMillership was born in the small mining village of Warsop Vale in [[Nottinghamshire]] on 8 June 1910. As a youth he excelled at both football and [[cricket]], playing his football for Warsop Main, [[Welbeck]] Athletic and [[Shirebrook Town F.C.]]. Upon leaving school he worked at Warsop colliery and was soon approached by [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club]], but their effort to sign him was rebuffed by Millership who wanted to further his football career.\n\n==Bradford Park Avenue==\nIn January 1928 he was invited for a trial at Bradford Park Avenue and was promptly signed making three appearances in the remainder of that season as Park Avenue lifted the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] championship. The following season Millership only made two appearances and it was not until the 1929\u201330 season that he became a regular in the Park Avenue forward line scoring 12 goals in 25 appearances including a goal in the [[FA cup]] fourth round upset of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and another in the 1\u20135 fifth round defeat against League champions Sheffield Wednesday on 15 February 1930. Despite the heavy defeat, Wednesday manager [[Robert Brown (football manager)|Bob Brown]] was sufficiently impressed with Millership to sign him for the [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] club the following month for a fee of \u00a32,600.<ref>[http://captainbeecher.webs.com/1930.htm 1930 Giant Killers]</ref>\n\n==Sheffield Wednesday==\nMillership played six games at [[Inside forward|inside right]] in the remainder of the 1929\u201330 season as Wednesday retained their [[Football League First Division|Division One]] title. However, for the next three season Millership's first team opportunities were limited as he was kept out of the side by ace inside forwards [[Jimmy Seed]], [[Harry Burgess (footballer)|Harry Burgess]] and latterly [[Ronnie Starling]]. In the 1931\u201332 season he had the fine record of 14 goals in 17 appearances including four goals in a 7\u20130 FA Cup 4th round victory over [[A.F.C. Bournemouth]] in January 1932 and a League hat-trick against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the same month.\n\nMillership's big chance in the Wednesday team came when it was decided to play him as a centre half towards the end of the 1932\u201333 season as a temporary replacement for the injured Tony Leach. Millership revelled in the central defensive position, his sturdy play earning him the nickname \"Battleship\" from Wednesday fans and by the end of 1933 he had made the position his own. He was Wednesday's first choice centre half for the next five seasons, playing in the [[1935 FA Cup Final]] victory over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] and coming close to earning an [[England national football team|England]] cap, playing in an international trial in March 1935.\n\nMillership lost his centre half place to [[Harry Hanford]] in the last full season before World War II (1938\u201339), however he played 12 games as a stand in centre forward, scoring eight goals when [[Douglas Hunt|Doug Hunt]] was injured. Millership captained Wednesday throughout the war playing in 155 wartime games, scoring 12 goals. He played in the 1943 War Cup Final defeat to [[Blackpool F.C.]]. He also played as a guest for [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] during the war.<ref name=\"allfootballers.com\">[http://allfootballers.com/ Since 1888.] Gives career statistics.</ref><ref name=\"SWFC Archive\">[http://www.adrianbullock.com/swfc/stats/play0414.htm SWFC Archive.] Gives statistics of Sheffield Wednesday career.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nMillership played on in [[Non-League football]] after the war signing for [[Denaby United F.C.|Denaby United]] in May 1946. It was at this time that Millership can claim to have discovered the 17-year-old [[Derek Dooley (footballer)|Derek Dooley]] who scored a hat trick for [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] reserves whilst playing against Denaby. Millership was quickly on the phone to Wednesday to inform them of Dooley's talent and he was signed in great haste by Wednesday manager [[Eric Taylor (football manager)|Eric Taylor]].
