On Ground 2, the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 the ERO was repealed by implication by the [[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance]] and/or the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) as applied in Hong Kong by the Basic Law. On Ground 3, the ERO cannot empower the Chief Executive to make any regulation restricting fundamental rights under the Basic Law or Bill of Rights. On Ground 4, the \u2018principle of legality ground\u2019, the Chief Executive acted ''ultra vires'' in that the ERO only applies to emergency situations. On Ground 5A, the \u2019section 3 proportionality ground\u2019, section 3 of the PFCR, which prohibits the use of facial coverings, disproportionately restricts privacy, and freedom of expression and assembly; on Ground 5B, the \u2018section 5 proportionality ground\u2019, section 5, concerning enforcement powers, is also disproportionate.\n\n==== Ground 1: the delegation of legislative power ground ====\n\nThe applicants submitted that under the Basic Law, legislative power is exclusively vested in the Legislative Council; since the ERO would grant legislative power to the executive, it is inconsistent with the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref> The government submitted that there is \u2018nothing in the Basic Law which provides whether expressly or by implication that the LegCo cannot authorise the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to make regulations during an occasion of public danger or emergency\u2019, that the ERO had already twice been held to be valid, that regulations made thereunder were not intended to be permanent, and that the LegCo could apply negative vetting to such regulations.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=36}}</ref>\n\nThe court declined to rule on the question of the constitutionality of the making of regulations by the Chief Executive in Council on an occasion of an emergency, and solely considered that concerning public danger.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=37}}</ref> The court accepted that a distinction between \u2018general legislative power\u2019 and the power to make \u2018subordinate legislation\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=53}}</ref> It drew such a distinction on the basis that the LegCo is \u2018designated as ''the'' legislature\u2019{{efn|Emphasis the court\u2019s.}} and that in the Chinese text of the Basic Law gives the LegCo \u2018''functions'' which in Chinese is \u201c\u8077\u201d in the phrase \u201c\u8077\u6b0a\u201d\u2019, which \u2018connotes\u2026[a] \u2019job\u2019\u201d.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=52}}</ref> The court then determined that the character of the powers granted by the ERO was more akin to that of a general legislative power than a subsidiary one, for several reasons. First, the powers granted by the ERO seemed not so much to \u2019leav[e] another body to devise the detailed legal norms that elaborate or put flesh on the broad matters laid down in the primary legislation\u2019 so much as to allow general legislation\u2014thus this very regulation was the first enactment to concern face covering in Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=56}}</ref> Second, the phrase \u2018any regulations whatsoever\u2019 grants powers \u2018of the widest possible nature\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=57}}</ref> Third, \u2018public danger\u2019 is inadequately defined.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=60}}</ref> Fourth, the ERO grants the Chief Executive power to amend or suspend any other enactment.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=63}}</ref> Fifth, the ERO permits the Chief Executive to prescribe punishments up to life imprisonment, ''inter alia'', which exceed those envisaged by the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1) vis \u00e0 vis subsidiary legislation.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|1|28|1|e}}</ref> Sixth, no time limit is envisaged by the ERO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=68}}</ref> Seventh, negative vetting is an inadequate safeguard given, ''inter alia'', that its operation could be suspended by a regulation under the ERO, and that the legal effects of its application before repeal by the Legislative Council would not be undone even if negative vetting were possible.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=74}}</ref> \n\nOn the fourth ground, the government submitted that such clauses are entirely permissible in other common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Australia;<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=65}}</ref> however, the court rejected the applicability of such a [[Diceyan]] notion of absolute parliamentary sovereignty in Hong Kong, on the basis that the Legislative Council\u2019s powers are derived from the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=66}}</ref> Ultimately the court concluded that the ERO in allowing for the making of regulations by the Chief Executive at a time of \u2018public danger\u2019 did so sufficiently broadly that it \u2018seems\u2026to create in Hong Kong a separate source of laws that are primary legislation in all but name\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=80}}</ref>\n\nThe government further submitted that the ERO had been vetted for constitutionality before the handover as a \u2018factor in favour of validity\u2019; however, the court held that article 160 of the Basic Law provided for the subsequent discovery of unconstitutionality.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=94}}</ref> The court therefore held the PFCR unconstitutional under ground 1, at least insofar as \u2018public danger\u2019 is concerned.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=97}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=60}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=193}}</ref>\n\n==== Ground 2: the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 ====\n\nThe applicants submitted that legislation could only derogate from the Bill of Rights when \u2018the life of the nation\u2019 is at risk, but that the ERO allowed for such derogations in a larger set of circumstances, and therefore was repealed by implication.{{efn|For brevity, the full argument is omitted;

It may be used for [[fluid replacement]].\n\n==Physiology==\n{{citation needed section|date = September 2019}}\nWhen blood is lost, the greatest immediate need is to stop further blood loss. The second greatest need is replacing the lost volume. This way remaining red blood cells can still oxygenate body tissue. Normal human blood has a significant excess oxygen transport capability, only used in cases of great physical exertion. Provided blood volume is maintained by volume expanders, a rested patient can safely tolerate very low hemoglobin levels, less than 1/3 that of a healthy person. see:[[Hematocrit]]\n\nThe body detects the lower hemoglobin level, and compensatory mechanisms start up. The [[heart]] pumps more blood with each beat. Since the lost blood was replaced with a suitable fluid, the now diluted blood flows more easily, even in the small vessels. As a result of chemical changes, more oxygen is released to the tissues. These adaptations are so effective that if only half of the red blood cells remain, oxygen delivery may still be about 75 percent of normal. A patient at rest uses only 25 percent of the oxygen available in their blood. In extreme cases, patients have survived with a hemoglobin level of 2 g/dl, about 1/7 the normal, although levels this low are very dangerous.\n\nWith enough blood loss, ultimately red blood cell levels drop too low for adequate tissue oxygenation, even if volume expanders maintain circulatory volume. In these situations, the only alternatives are blood transfusions, packed red blood cells, or oxygen therapeutics (if available). However, in some circumstances, [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] can maintain adequate tissue oxygenation even if red blood cell levels are below normal life-sustaining levels.\n\n==Types==\nThere are two main types of volume expanders: crystalloids and colloids. Crystalloids are aqueous [[solution]]s of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules. Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules, such as [[gelatin]]; [[blood]] itself is a colloid. There is no evidence that colloids are better than crystalloids in those who have had trauma, burns, or surgery. Colloids are more expensive than crystalloids. As such, colloids are not recommended for volume expansion in these settings.<ref name=Cochran2013/>\n\n===Crystalloids===\nThe most commonly used crystalloid fluid is ''normal [[Saline (medicine)|saline]]'', a solution of [[sodium chloride]] at 0.9% concentration, which is close to the concentration in the blood ([[Isotonicity|isotonic]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Choosing between colloids and crystalloids for IV infusion |url=https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/critical-care/choosing-between-colloids-and-crystalloids-for-iv-infusion-20-11-2017/ |website=Nursing Times |accessdate=31 August 2018 |language=en}}</ref> ''[[Ringer's lactate]]'' or ''Ringer's acetate'' is another isotonic solution often used for large-volume fluid replacement. The choice of fluids may also depend on the chemical properties of the medications being given.\n\n====Normal saline====\n{{Main|Saline (medicine)}}\n''Normal saline'' (NS) is the commonly used term for a solution of 0.9% [[Mass concentration (chemistry)|w/v]] of [[sodium chloride|NaCl]], about 300 [[Osmolality|mOsm]]/L.<ref>Note that in [[chemistry]], a one normal of NaCl (see [[Concentration#Normality|normality]]) is 0.5 molar (see [[molarity]]) NaCl assuming complete dissociation. Physiological dissociation is approximately 1.7 ions per mole, so one normal of NaCl is 1/1.7 = 0.588 molar.  This is roughly 4 times more concentrated than medical \"normal saline\" of 0.154 molar.</ref> Less commonly, this solution is referred to as ''physiological saline'' or ''isotonic saline'', neither of which is technically accurate. NS is used frequently in [[intravenous drip]]s (IVs) for patients who cannot take fluids orally and have developed or are in danger of developing [[dehydration]] or [[hypovolemia]]. NS is typically the first fluid used when hypovolemia is severe enough to threaten the adequacy of blood circulation, and has long been believed to be the safest fluid to give quickly in large volumes. However, it is now known that rapid infusion of NS can cause [[metabolic acidosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n|last= Prough\n|first= DS\n|author2=Bidani, A\n |year=1999\n|title=Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is a predictable consequence of intraoperative infusion of 0.9% saline\n|journal=Anesthesiology\n|volume=90\n|issue=5\n|pages=1247\u20131249\n|pmid = 10319767\n|doi =10.1097/00000542-199905000-00003\n|url = http://www.anesthesiology.org/pt/re/anes/fulltext.00000542-199905000-00003.htm;jsessionid=L97P825yCKJn2HYBhbyhzynlZF1lTJQyHGR1JNK7nHTvscph2xfr!536197444!181195628!8091!-1\n}} {{Dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Ringer's solution====\n[[Lactated Ringer's solution]] contains 28&nbsp;mmol/L lactate, 4&nbsp;mmol/L K<sup>+</sup> and 1.5&nbsp;mmol/L Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
