Therefore, they came to be known as \"Moriyas\", literally, \"belonging to the place of peacocks\". According to another Buddhist account, these ancestors built a city called Moriya-nagara (\"Moriya-city\"), which was so called, because it was built with the \"bricks coloured like peacocks' necks\".{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=14}}\n\nThe dynasty's connection to the peacocks, as mentioned in the Buddhist and Jain traditions, seems to be corroborated by archaeological evidence. For example, peacock figures are found on the [[Lauria Nandangarh#Pillar of Ashoka|Ashoka pillar at Nandangarh]] and several sculptures on the Great Stupa of [[Sanchi]]. Based on this evidence, modern scholars theorize that the peacock may have been the dynasty's emblem.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=15}}\n\nSome later authors, such as Dhundiraja (a commentator on the ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'') and an annotator of the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'',state that the word \"Maurya\" is derived from Mura, the name of the wife of a Nanda king and the mother (or grandmother) of the first Maurya king. However, the Puranas themselves make no mention of Mura and do not talk of any relation between the Nanda and the Maurya dynasties.{{sfn|H. C. Raychaudhuri|1988|p=140}} Dhundiraja's derivation of the word seems to be his own invention: according to the Sanskrit rules, the derivative of the feminine name Mura ([[IAST]]: Mur\u0101) would be \"Maureya\"; the term \"Maurya\" can only be derived from the masculine \"Mura\".{{sfn|R.

K. Mookerji|1966|p=31}}\n\nChandragupta Maurya's rise to power is shrouded in mystery and controversy. On one hand, a number of ancient Indian accounts, such as the drama ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'' (''Signet ring of Rakshasa'' \u2013 ''Rakshasa'' was the prime minister of Magadha) by [[Vishakhadatta]], describe his royal ancestry and even link him with the Nanda family.

A battle was announced and the Magadhan army was drawn from the city to a distant battlefield to engage with Maurya's forces. Maurya's general and spies meanwhile bribed the corrupt general of Nanda. He also managed to create an atmosphere of civil war in the kingdom, which culminated in the death of the heir to the throne. Chanakya managed to win over popular sentiment. Ultimately Nanda resigned, handing power to Chandragupta, and went into exile and was never heard of again. Chanakya contacted the prime minister, Rakshasas, and made him understand that his loyalty was to Magadha, not to the Nanda dynasty, insisting that he continue in office. Chanakya also reiterated that choosing to resist would start a war that would severely affect Magadha and destroy the city. Rakshasa accepted Chanakya's reasoning, and Chandragupta Maurya was legitimately installed as the new King of Magadha.

The edicts precisely name each of the rulers of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] world at the time such as ''Amtiyoko'' ([[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus]]), ''Tulamaya'' ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]]), ''Amtikini'' ([[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]]), ''Maka'' ([[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]]) and ''Alikasudaro'' ([[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]) as recipients of Ashoka's proselytism.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The Edicts also accurately locate their territory \"600 yojanas away\" (a yojanas being about 7&nbsp;miles), corresponding to the distance between the center of India and Greece (roughly 4,000&nbsp;miles).<ref>[[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, translation S. Dhammika.</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nAshoka was followed for 50&nbsp;years by a succession of weaker kings. He was succeeded by [[Dasharatha Maurya]], who was Ashoka's grandson. None of Ashoka's sons could ascend the throne after him. Mahendra, his first born, was on to spread [[Buddhism]] in the world. [[Kunala|Kunala Maurya]] was blind hence couldn't ascend the throne and Tivala, son of Kaurwaki, died even earlier than Ashoka. Another son, Jalauka, does not have much story behind him.\n\nThe empire lost many territories under Dasharatha, which were later reconquered by [[Samprati]], Kunala's son. Post Samprati, the Mauryas slowly lost many territories. In 180 BCE, [[Brihadratha Maurya]], was killed by his general [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] in a military parade without any heir. Hence, the great Maurya empire finally ended, giving rise to the [[Shunga Empire]].\n\n====Shunga coup (185&nbsp;BCE)====\nBuddhist records such as the [[Ashokavadana]] write that the assassination of Brihadratha and the rise of the Shunga empire led to a wave of religious persecution for [[Buddhists]],<ref>According to the [[Ashokavadana]]</ref> and a resurgence of [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Sir John Marshall]],<ref>Sir John Marshall, \"A Guide to Sanchi\", Eastern Book House, 1990, {{ISBN|81-85204-32-2}}, pg.38</ref> Pushyamitra may have been the main author of the persecutions, although later Shunga kings seem to have been more supportive of Buddhism. Other historians, such as [[Etienne Lamotte]]<ref>E. Lamotte: History of Indian Buddhism, Institut Orientaliste, Louvain-la-Neuve 1988 (1958)</ref> and [[Romila Thapar]],<ref>A\u015boka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 P200</ref> among others, have argued that archaeological evidence in favour of the allegations of persecution of Buddhists are lacking, and that the extent and magnitude of the atrocities have been exaggerated.\n\n====Establishment of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180&nbsp;BCE)====\n{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom}}\nThe fall of the Mauryas left the [[Khyber Pass]] unguarded, and a wave of foreign invasion followed. The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] king, [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]], capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180&nbsp;BCE, forming the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, [[Menander I|Menander]], became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was to establish a new capital of Sagala, the modern city of [[Sialkot]]. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]]s, [[Satavahana]]s, and [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]]s are unclear, what is clear is that Scythian tribes, renamed [[Indo-Scythians]], brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70&nbsp;BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and Gujarat.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|Statuettes of the Mauryan era]]\n\nThe Empire was divided into four provinces, with the imperial capital at [[Pataliputra]]. From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are [[Tosali]] (in the east), [[Ujjain]] (in the west), [[Suvarnagiri]] (in the south), and [[Taxila]] (in the north). The head of the provincial administration was the ''Kumara'' (royal prince), who governed the provinces as king's representative. The ''kumara'' was assisted by Mahamatyas and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected at the imperial level with the Emperor and his ''Mantriparishad'' (Council of Ministers).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHistorians theorise that the organisation of the Empire was in line with the extensive bureaucracy described by [[Chanakya|Kautilya]] in the [[Arthashastra]]: a sophisticated civil service governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade. The expansion and defense of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been one of the largest armies in the world during the [[Iron Age]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gabriel A |first=Richard |title=The Ancient World :Volume 1 of Soldiers' lives through history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HscIwvtkq2UC&pg=PA301 |date=30 November 2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |p=28 |isbn=9780313333484 }}</ref> According to Megasthenes, the empire wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots and 9,000 war elephants besides followers and attendants.{{sfn|R.

The first board fixed wages and looked after provided goods, second board made arrangement for foreign dignitaries, tourists and businessmen, third board made records and registrations, fourth looked after manufactured goodsand sale of commodities, fifth board regulated trade, issued licenses and checked weights and measurements, sixth board collected sales taxes. Some cities such as Taxila had autonomy to issue their own coins.

The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the ''Arthashastra''. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nUnder the Indo-Greek friendship treaty, and during Ashoka's reign, an international network of trade expanded. The [[Khyber Pass]], on the modern boundary of [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], became a strategically important port of trade and intercourse with the outside world. Greek states and Hellenic kingdoms in West Asia became important trade partners of India. Trade also extended through the [[Malay peninsula]] into Southeast Asia. India's exports included silk goods and textiles, spices and exotic foods. The external world came across new scientific knowledge and technology with expanding trade with the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, rest-houses and other public works. The easing of many over-rigorous administrative practices, including those regarding taxation and crop collection, helped increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn many ways, the economic situation in the Mauryan Empire is analogous to the Roman Empire of several centuries later. Both had extensive trade connections and both had organizations similar to [[corporation]]s. While Rome had organizational entities which were largely used for public state-driven projects, Mauryan India had numerous private commercial entities. These existed purely for private commerce and developed before the Mauryan Empire itself.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 ''The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204000202/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 |date=4 February 2016 }} [[University of Michigan]].</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"  align=\"center\"  colspan=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|align=center colspan=1 style=\"background:#F4A460; font-size: 100%;\"| '''Maurya Empire coinage'''\n|-\n|<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nHoard of mostly Mauryan coins.jpg|Hoard of mostly Mauryan coins.\nFile:MauryanCoin.JPG|Silver punch mark coin of the Maurya empire, with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BCE.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.jpg|Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan Empire.

Chandragupta was a disciple of the Jain monk [[Bhadrabahu|Acharya Bhadrabahu]].

Chandragupta and Samprati are credited for the spread of Jainism in [[South India]]. Hundreds of thousands of temples and stupas are said to have been erected during their reigns\n\n===Buddhism===\n[[File:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|The [[stupa]], which contained the relics of Buddha, at the center of the [[Sanchi]] complex was originally built by the Maurya Empire, but the balustrade around it is [[Sunga]], and the decorative gateways are from the later [[Satavahana]] period.]]\n[[File:Taxila1.jpg|thumb|The [[Dharmarajika]] [[stupa]] in [[Taxila]], modern [[Pakistan]], is also thought to have been established by Emperor [[Asoka]].]]\n[[Magadha]], the centre of the empire, was also the birthplace of [[Buddhism]]. Ashoka initially practised Hinduism but later embraced Buddhism; following the [[Kalinga War]], he renounced expansionism and aggression, and the harsher injunctions of the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' on the use of force, intensive policing, and ruthless measures for tax collection and against rebels. Ashoka sent a mission led by his son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] and daughter [[Sanghamitta]] to [[Sri Lanka]], whose king [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Tissa]] was so charmed with Buddhist ideals that he adopted them himself and made Buddhism the state religion. Ashoka sent many Buddhist missions to [[West Asia]], [[Greece]] and [[South East Asia]], and commissioned the construction of monasteries and schools, as well as the publication of Buddhist literature across the empire. He is believed to have built as many as 84,000 stupas across India, such as [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]], and he increased the popularity of Buddhism in [[Afghanistan]], [[Thailand]] and [[North Asia]] including [[Siberia]]. Ashoka helped convene the [[Buddhist Councils|Third Buddhist Council]] of India's and South Asia's Buddhist orders near his capital, a council that undertook much work of reform and expansion of the Buddhist religion. Indian merchants embraced Buddhism and played a large role in spreading the religion across the Mauryan Empire.<ref>Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press), 46</ref>\n\n==Architectural remains==\n{{Main|Edicts of Ashoka|Sanchi Stupa|Mauryan art}}\n[[File:Barabar Caves 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Mauryan architecture in the [[Barabar Caves]]. [[Lomas Rishi Cave]]. 3rd century BCE.]]\n\nThe greatest monument of this period, executed in the reign of [[Chandragupta Maurya]], was the old palace at Paliputra, modern [[Kumhrar]] in [[Patna]]. Excavations have unearthed the remains of the palace, which is thought to have been an group of several buildings, the most important of which was an immense pillared hall supported on a high substratum of timbers. The pillars were set in regular rows, thus dividing the hall into a number of smaller square bays. The number of columns is 80, each about {{formatnum:{{#expr:9.75-2.74 round 0}}}} meters high. According to the eyewitness account of [[Megasthenes]], the palace was chiefly constructed of timber, and was considered to exceed in splendour and magnificence the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, its gilded pillars being adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The buildings stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds and furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs.<ref>\"L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique\", p23</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}} Kau\u1e6dilya's [[Arthashastra]] also gives the method of palace construction from this period. Later fragments of stone pillars, including one nearly complete, with their round tapering shafts and smooth polish, indicate that Ashoka was responsible for the construction of the stone columns which replaced the earlier wooden ones.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Early stupa 6 meters in diameter with fallen umbrella on side in Chakpat near Chakdara.jpg|thumb|left|An early [[stupa]], 6 meters in diameter, with fallen umbrella on side.

The use of stone had reached such great perfection during this time that even small fragments of stone art were given a high lustrous polish resembling fine enamel. This period marked the beginning of the Buddhist school of architecture.  Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several [[stupas]], which were large domes and bearing symbols of Buddha. The most important ones are located at [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]], [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[Bodhgaya]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]]. The most widespread examples of Mauryan architecture are the [[Ashoka pillar]]s and carved edicts of Ashoka, often exquisitely decorated, with more than 40 spread throughout the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref>\"L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique\", p22</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe peacock was a dynastic symbol of Mauryans, as depicted by Ashoka's pillars at Nandangarh and Sanchi Stupa.{{sfn|R.

For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also [[War elephants|battle-elephants]]; these played a role in the defeat of [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], one of [[Alexander]]'s former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than to raise them. [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the ''Protector of the Elephant Forests''.<ref name=\"IWH4\">Rangarajan, M.

The Office of the Chief Elephant Forester should with the help of guards protect the elephants in any terrain. The slaying of an elephant is punishable by death.|[[Arthashastra]]}}\n\nThe Mauryas also designated separate forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers for skins. Elsewhere the ''Protector of Animals'' also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or ''aranyaca'' to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.<ref name=\"IWH5\">Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 8.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Ashoka]] embraced [[Buddhism]] in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was the first ruler in history{{failed verification|date=September 2017}} to advocate [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts. The edicts proclaim that many followed the king's example in giving up the slaughter of animals; one of them proudly states:<ref name=\"IWH5\"/>\n{{quote|Our king killed very few animals.|[[Edicts of Ashoka|Edict on Fifth Pillar]]}}\n\nHowever, the edicts of Ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100 'panas' (coins) fine for poaching deer in royal hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist.

In the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edicts of Ashoka]], some of them inscribed in Greek, Ashoka states that the Greeks within his dominion were converted to Buddhism:\n:<blockquote>\"Here in the king's dominion among the [[Yona|Greeks]], the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhras]] and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].\" [[Edicts of Ashoka|(Rock Edict Number 13]])</blockquote>[[File:Ashoka Rock Edicts Shahbazgarhi by Nisar.JPG|thumb|An Edict of Ashoka in Shahbazbarhi, KPK, Pakistan.]]<blockquote>\"Now, in times past (officers) called [[Mahamatras]] of morality did not exist before. Mahdmatras of morality were appointed by me (when I had been) anointed thirteen years. These are occupied with all sects in establishing morality, in promoting morality, and for the welfare and happiness of those who are devoted to morality (even) among the [[Yona|Greeks]], [[Kambojas]] and [[Gandharas]], and whatever other western borderers (of mine there are).\" ([[Major Rock Edicts|Rock Edict Number 5]])</blockquote>\n\n[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kandahar Edict of Ashoka]], a bilingual edict ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) by king Ashoka, from [[Kandahar]].

It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka uses the word [[Eusebeia]] (\"[[Piety]]\") as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous \"[[Dharma]]\" of his other Edicts written in [[Prakrit]]:{{npsn|date=August 2016}}\n:\"Ten years (of reign) having been completed, King Piodasses (Ashoka) made known (the doctrine of) Piety (''\u03b5\u1f50\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1'', [[Eusebeia]]) to men; and from this moment he has made men more pious, and everything thrives throughout the whole world. And the king abstains from (killing) living beings, and other men and those who (are) huntsmen and fishermen of the king have desisted from hunting.

Therefore, they came to be known as \"Moriyas\", literally, \"belonging to the place of peacocks\". According to another Buddhist account, these ancestors built a city called Moriya-nagara (\"Moriya-city\"), which was so called, because it was built with the \"bricks coloured like peacocks' necks\".{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=14}}\n\nThe dynasty's connection to the peacocks, as mentioned in the Buddhist and Jain traditions, seems to be corroborated by archaeological evidence. For example, peacock figures are found on the [[Lauria Nandangarh#Pillar of Ashoka|Ashoka pillar at Nandangarh]] and several sculptures on the Great Stupa of [[Sanchi]]. Based on this evidence, modern scholars theorize that the peacock may have been the dynasty's emblem.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=15}}\n\nSome later authors, such as Dhundiraja (a commentator on the ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'') and an annotator of the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'',state that the word \"Maurya\" is derived from Mura, the name of the wife of a Nanda king and the mother (or grandmother) of the first Maurya king. However, the Puranas themselves make no mention of Mura and do not talk of any relation between the Nanda and the Maurya dynasties.{{sfn|H. C. Raychaudhuri|1988|p=140}} Dhundiraja's derivation of the word seems to be his own invention: according to the Sanskrit rules, the derivative of the feminine name Mura ([[IAST]]: Mur\u0101) would be \"Maureya\"; the term \"Maurya\" can only be derived from the masculine \"Mura\".{{sfn|R.

A kshatriya clan known as the Mauryas are referred to in the earliest [[Buddhist texts]], [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]. However, any conclusions are hard to make without further historical evidence. Chandragupta first emerges in Greek accounts as \"Sandrokottos\". As a young man he is said to have met Alexander.<ref>:\"Androcottus, when he was a stripling, saw Alexander himself, and we are told that he often said in later times that Alexander narrowly missed making himself master of the country, since its king was hated and despised on account of his baseness and low birth.\" Plutarch 62-3 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243&layout=&loc=62.1 Plutarch 62-3]</ref> He is also said to have met the Nanda king, angered him, and made a narrow escape.<ref>:\"He was of humble Indian to a change of rule.\" Justin XV.4.15 \"Fuit hic humili quidem genere natus, sed ad regni potestatem maiestate numinis inpulsus.

A battle was announced and the Magadhan army was drawn from the city to a distant battlefield to engage with Maurya's forces. Maurya's general and spies meanwhile bribed the corrupt general of Nanda. He also managed to create an atmosphere of civil war in the kingdom, which culminated in the death of the heir to the throne. Chanakya managed to win over popular sentiment. Ultimately Nanda resigned, handing power to Chandragupta, and went into exile and was never heard of again. Chanakya contacted the prime minister, Rakshasas, and made him understand that his loyalty was to Magadha, not to the Nanda dynasty, insisting that he continue in office. Chanakya also reiterated that choosing to resist would start a war that would severely affect Magadha and destroy the city. Rakshasa accepted Chanakya's reasoning, and Chandragupta Maurya was legitimately installed as the new King of Magadha.

As monarch he was ambitious and aggressive, re-asserting the Empire's superiority in southern and western India. But it was his conquest of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] (262\u2013261&nbsp;BCE) which proved to be the pivotal event of his life. Ashoka used Kalinga to project power over a large region by building a fortification there and securing it as a possession.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|last=Allchin|first=F.R.|last2=Erdosy|first2=George|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|location=Cambridge|pages=306}}</ref> Although Ashoka's army succeeded in overwhelming Kalinga forces of royal soldiers and civilian units, an estimated 100,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the furious warfare, including over 10,000 of Ashoka's own men. Hundreds of thousands of people were adversely affected by the destruction and fallout of war. When he personally witnessed the devastation, Ashoka began feeling remorse. Although the annexation of Kalinga was completed, Ashoka embraced the teachings of [[Buddhism]], and renounced war and violence. He sent out missionaries to travel around Asia and spread Buddhism to other countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAshoka implemented principles of ''[[ahimsa]]'' by banning hunting and violent sports activity and ending indentured and forced labor (many thousands of people in war-ravaged Kalinga had been forced into hard labour and servitude). While he maintained a large and powerful army, to keep the peace and maintain authority, Ashoka expanded friendly relations with states across Asia and Europe, and he sponsored Buddhist missions. He undertook a massive public works building campaign across the country. Over 40&nbsp;years of peace, harmony and prosperity made Ashoka one of the most successful and famous monarchs in Indian history. He remains an idealized figure of inspiration in modern India.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, are found throughout the Subcontinent. Ranging from as far west as [[Afghanistan]] and as far south as Andhra ([[Nellore District]]), Ashoka's edicts state his policies and accomplishments. Although predominantly written in Prakrit, two of them were written in [[Greek language|Greek]], and one in both Greek and [[Aramaic]]. Ashoka's edicts refer to the Greeks, [[Kambojas]], and [[Gandhara]]s as peoples forming a frontier region of his empire. They also attest to Ashoka's having sent envoys to the Greek rulers in the West as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts precisely name each of the rulers of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] world at the time such as ''Amtiyoko'' ([[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus]]), ''Tulamaya'' ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]]), ''Amtikini'' ([[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]]), ''Maka'' ([[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]]) and ''Alikasudaro'' ([[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]) as recipients of Ashoka's proselytism.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The Edicts also accurately locate their territory \"600 yojanas away\" (a yojanas being about 7&nbsp;miles), corresponding to the distance between the center of India and Greece (roughly 4,000&nbsp;miles).<ref>[[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, translation S. Dhammika.</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nAshoka was followed for 50&nbsp;years by a succession of weaker kings. He was succeeded by [[Dasharatha Maurya]], who was Ashoka's grandson. None of Ashoka's sons could ascend the throne after him. Mahendra, his first born, was on to spread [[Buddhism]] in the world. [[Kunala|Kunala Maurya]] was blind hence couldn't ascend the throne and Tivala, son of Kaurwaki, died even earlier than Ashoka. Another son, Jalauka, does not have much story behind him.\n\nThe empire lost many territories under Dasharatha, which were later reconquered by [[Samprati]], Kunala's son. Post Samprati, the Mauryas slowly lost many territories. In 180 BCE, [[Brihadratha Maurya]], was killed by his general [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] in a military parade without any heir. Hence, the great Maurya empire finally ended, giving rise to the [[Shunga Empire]].\n\n====Shunga coup (185&nbsp;BCE)====\nBuddhist records such as the [[Ashokavadana]] write that the assassination of Brihadratha and the rise of the Shunga empire led to a wave of religious persecution for [[Buddhists]],<ref>According to the [[Ashokavadana]]</ref> and a resurgence of [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Sir John Marshall]],<ref>Sir John Marshall, \"A Guide to Sanchi\", Eastern Book House, 1990, {{ISBN|81-85204-32-2}}, pg.38</ref> Pushyamitra may have been the main author of the persecutions, although later Shunga kings seem to have been more supportive of Buddhism. Other historians, such as [[Etienne Lamotte]]<ref>E. Lamotte: History of Indian Buddhism, Institut Orientaliste, Louvain-la-Neuve 1988 (1958)</ref> and [[Romila Thapar]],<ref>A\u015boka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 P200</ref> among others, have argued that archaeological evidence in favour of the allegations of persecution of Buddhists are lacking, and that the extent and magnitude of the atrocities have been exaggerated.\n\n====Establishment of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180&nbsp;BCE)====\n{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom}}\nThe fall of the Mauryas left the [[Khyber Pass]] unguarded, and a wave of foreign invasion followed. The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] king, [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]], capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180&nbsp;BCE, forming the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, [[Menander I|Menander]], became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was to establish a new capital of Sagala, the modern city of [[Sialkot]]. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]]s, [[Satavahana]]s, and [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]]s are unclear, what is clear is that Scythian tribes, renamed [[Indo-Scythians]], brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70&nbsp;BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and Gujarat.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|Statuettes of the Mauryan era]]\n\nThe Empire was divided into four provinces, with the imperial capital at [[Pataliputra]]. From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are [[Tosali]] (in the east), [[Ujjain]] (in the west), [[Suvarnagiri]] (in the south), and [[Taxila]] (in the north). The head of the provincial administration was the ''Kumara'' (royal prince), who governed the provinces as king's representative. The ''kumara'' was assisted by Mahamatyas and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected at the imperial level with the Emperor and his ''Mantriparishad'' (Council of Ministers).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHistorians theorise that the organisation of the Empire was in line with the extensive bureaucracy described by [[Chanakya|Kautilya]] in the [[Arthashastra]]: a sophisticated civil service governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade. The expansion and defense of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been one of the largest armies in the world during the [[Iron Age]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gabriel A |first=Richard |title=The Ancient World :Volume 1 of Soldiers' lives through history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HscIwvtkq2UC&pg=PA301 |date=30 November 2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |p=28 |isbn=9780313333484 }}</ref> According to Megasthenes, the empire wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots and 9,000 war elephants besides followers and attendants.{{sfn|R.

The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the ''Arthashastra''. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nUnder the Indo-Greek friendship treaty, and during Ashoka's reign, an international network of trade expanded. The [[Khyber Pass]], on the modern boundary of [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], became a strategically important port of trade and intercourse with the outside world. Greek states and Hellenic kingdoms in West Asia became important trade partners of India. Trade also extended through the [[Malay peninsula]] into Southeast Asia. India's exports included silk goods and textiles, spices and exotic foods. The external world came across new scientific knowledge and technology with expanding trade with the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, rest-houses and other public works. The easing of many over-rigorous administrative practices, including those regarding taxation and crop collection, helped increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn many ways, the economic situation in the Mauryan Empire is analogous to the Roman Empire of several centuries later. Both had extensive trade connections and both had organizations similar to [[corporation]]s. While Rome had organizational entities which were largely used for public state-driven projects, Mauryan India had numerous private commercial entities. These existed purely for private commerce and developed before the Mauryan Empire itself.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 ''The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204000202/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 |date=4 February 2016 }} [[University of Michigan]].</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"  align=\"center\"  colspan=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|align=center colspan=1 style=\"background:#F4A460; font-size: 100%;\"| '''Maurya Empire coinage'''\n|-\n|<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nHoard of mostly Mauryan coins.jpg|Hoard of mostly Mauryan coins.\nFile:MauryanCoin.JPG|Silver punch mark coin of the Maurya empire, with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BCE.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.jpg|Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan Empire.

Chandragupta was a disciple of the Jain monk [[Bhadrabahu|Acharya Bhadrabahu]].

Ashoka initially practised Hinduism but later embraced Buddhism; following the [[Kalinga War]], he renounced expansionism and aggression, and the harsher injunctions of the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' on the use of force, intensive policing, and ruthless measures for tax collection and against rebels. Ashoka sent a mission led by his son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] and daughter [[Sanghamitta]] to [[Sri Lanka]], whose king [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Tissa]] was so charmed with Buddhist ideals that he adopted them himself and made Buddhism the state religion. Ashoka sent many Buddhist missions to [[West Asia]], [[Greece]] and [[South East Asia]], and commissioned the construction of monasteries and schools, as well as the publication of Buddhist literature across the empire. He is believed to have built as many as 84,000 stupas across India, such as [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]], and he increased the popularity of Buddhism in [[Afghanistan]], [[Thailand]] and [[North Asia]] including [[Siberia]]. Ashoka helped convene the [[Buddhist Councils|Third Buddhist Council]] of India's and South Asia's Buddhist orders near his capital, a council that undertook much work of reform and expansion of the Buddhist religion. Indian merchants embraced Buddhism and played a large role in spreading the religion across the Mauryan Empire.<ref>Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press), 46</ref>\n\n==Architectural remains==\n{{Main|Edicts of Ashoka|Sanchi Stupa|Mauryan art}}\n[[File:Barabar Caves 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Mauryan architecture in the [[Barabar Caves]].

Excavations have unearthed the remains of the palace, which is thought to have been an group of several buildings, the most important of which was an immense pillared hall supported on a high substratum of timbers. The pillars were set in regular rows, thus dividing the hall into a number of smaller square bays. The number of columns is 80, each about {{formatnum:{{#expr:9.75-2.74 round 0}}}} meters high. According to the eyewitness account of [[Megasthenes]], the palace was chiefly constructed of timber, and was considered to exceed in splendour and magnificence the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, its gilded pillars being adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The buildings stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds and furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs.<ref>\"L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique\", p23</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}} Kau\u1e6dilya's [[Arthashastra]] also gives the method of palace construction from this period. Later fragments of stone pillars, including one nearly complete, with their round tapering shafts and smooth polish, indicate that Ashoka was responsible for the construction of the stone columns which replaced the earlier wooden ones.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Early stupa 6 meters in diameter with fallen umbrella on side in Chakpat near Chakdara.jpg|thumb|left|An early [[stupa]], 6 meters in diameter, with fallen umbrella on side.

The use of stone had reached such great perfection during this time that even small fragments of stone art were given a high lustrous polish resembling fine enamel. This period marked the beginning of the Buddhist school of architecture.  Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several [[stupas]], which were large domes and bearing symbols of Buddha. The most important ones are located at [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]], [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[Bodhgaya]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]]. The most widespread examples of Mauryan architecture are the [[Ashoka pillar]]s and carved edicts of Ashoka, often exquisitely decorated, with more than 40 spread throughout the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref>\"L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique\", p22</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe peacock was a dynastic symbol of Mauryans, as depicted by Ashoka's pillars at Nandangarh and Sanchi Stupa.{{sfn|R.

For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also [[War elephants|battle-elephants]]; these played a role in the defeat of [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], one of [[Alexander]]'s former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than to raise them. [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the ''Protector of the Elephant Forests''.<ref name=\"IWH4\">Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 7.</ref>\n\n{{quote|On the border of the forest, he should establish a forest for elephants guarded by foresters. The Office of the Chief Elephant Forester should with the help of guards protect the elephants in any terrain. The slaying of an elephant is punishable by death.|[[Arthashastra]]}}\n\nThe Mauryas also designated separate forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers for skins. Elsewhere the ''Protector of Animals'' also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or ''aranyaca'' to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.<ref name=\"IWH5\">Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 8.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Ashoka]] embraced [[Buddhism]] in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was the first ruler in history{{failed verification|date=September 2017}} to advocate [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts. The edicts proclaim that many followed the king's example in giving up the slaughter of animals; one of them proudly states:<ref name=\"IWH5\"/>\n{{quote|Our king killed very few animals.|[[Edicts of Ashoka|Edict on Fifth Pillar]]}}\n\nHowever, the edicts of Ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100 'panas' (coins) fine for poaching deer in royal hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist. The legal restrictions conflicted with the practices freely exercised by the common people in hunting, felling, fishing and setting fires in forests.<ref name=\"IWH5\"/>\n\n==Contacts with the Hellenistic world==\n[[File:MauryanRingstone.JPG|thumb|Mauryan ringstone, with standing goddess.

In the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edicts of Ashoka]], some of them inscribed in Greek, Ashoka states that the Greeks within his dominion were converted to Buddhism:\n:<blockquote>\"Here in the king's dominion among the [[Yona|Greeks]], the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhras]] and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].\" [[Edicts of Ashoka|(Rock Edict Number 13]])</blockquote>[[File:Ashoka Rock Edicts Shahbazgarhi by Nisar.JPG|thumb|An Edict of Ashoka in Shahbazbarhi, KPK, Pakistan.]]<blockquote>\"Now, in times past (officers) called [[Mahamatras]] of morality did not exist before. Mahdmatras of morality were appointed by me (when I had been) anointed thirteen years. These are occupied with all sects in establishing morality, in promoting morality, and for the welfare and happiness of those who are devoted to morality (even) among the [[Yona|Greeks]], [[Kambojas]] and [[Gandharas]], and whatever other western borderers (of mine there are).\" ([[Major Rock Edicts|Rock Edict Number 5]])</blockquote>\n\n[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kandahar Edict of Ashoka]], a bilingual edict ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) by king Ashoka, from [[Kandahar]]. [[Kabul]] Museum. (Click image for translation).]]\nFragments of Edict 13 have been found in Greek, and a full Edict, written in both Greek and Aramaic, has been discovered in [[Kandahar]]. It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka uses the word [[Eusebeia]] (\"[[Piety]]\") as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous \"[[Dharma]]\" of his other Edicts written in [[Prakrit]]:{{npsn|date=August 2016}}\n:\"Ten years (of reign) having been completed, King Piodasses (Ashoka) made known (the doctrine of) Piety (''\u03b5\u1f50\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1'', [[Eusebeia]]) to men; and from this moment he has made men more pious, and everything thrives throughout the whole world. And the king abstains from (killing) living beings, and other men and those who (are) huntsmen and fishermen of the king have desisted from hunting. And if some (were) intemperate, they have ceased from their intemperance as was in their power; and obedient to their father and mother and to the elders, in opposition to the past also in the future, by so acting on every occasion, they will live better and more happily\".

Excluding research stations in Antarctica, Puerto Toro is the southernmost permanently inhabited community on the globe, and some 3,900&nbsp;km (2425 miles) off the [[South Pole]]. It is the only such community on Earth that is situated below the [[55th parallel south]]. Puerto Toro is inhabited by 36 people according to [http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/demografia/demografia.php INE]'s 2002 census, including fishermen and their families.

In 1861, he succeeded his father as [[Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]] (and in various other titles across four [[Peerages]]) and took his seat in the [[House of Lords]]; he also resigned as chairman of the London and North-Western Railway. In the 1860s he was chairman of the [[London Pneumatic Despatch Company]].\n\nBuckingham's political career was stagnant until 1866, when he was appointed to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] and became Lord Derby's [[Lord President of the Council]]. During the interregnum, Buckingham served as chairman of the executive committee of the royal commission for the Great Exhibition of 1862.

Buckingham had to deal with the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]. He also attracted controversy over his dispute with [[John Colenso|Bishop Colenso]] of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]].

Through the House of Lords ruling, Buckingham's father was recognised posthumously as ''[[de jure]]'' 9th Lord Kinloss, his maternal grandmother Lady Anna Brydges as ''de jure'' 8th Lady Kinloss, and his great-grandfather [[James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos]] as ''de jure'' 7th Lord Kinloss.

Opened in 1878, this canal was named after Buckingham as [[Buckingham Canal]].<ref name=\"times\"/> Buckingham Street in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]] was also named after him by the [[Tamils|Tamil]] labourers who were brought there during the British colonial period. \n\nDispleasure of the tribes of the northern part of the Presidency over the stringent taxation schemes of the British government erupted in the form of the [[Rampa Rebellion of 1879|a major rebellion]] in 1879. The rebellion was eventually suppressed through a joint operation of the Madras police and army and the Hyderabad army and the captured prisoners sent to the Andamans. Many of the stringent taxation laws were repealed.\n\nOn 30 August 1880, [[William Patrick Adam]] was appointed Governor of Madras<ref name=\"nytimes18800831\">{{cite news| title=Current Foreign Topics| newspaper=The New York Times| date=31 August 1880| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1880/09/01/98625728.pdf}}</ref> and he succeeded Buckingham in December 1880.\n\n==Later life and death==\nIn May 1886, Buckingham succeeded [[John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Earl of Redesdale|Lord Redesdale]] as Chairman of Committees in the [[House of Lords]]. He made few speeches in the House of Lords and succeeded in paying off most of his father's debts. Gradually, towards the later part of his life his financial situation improved and by 1883, he owned 10,482 acres of land with a total value of \u00a318,080.\n\nBuckingham died in March 1889, aged 65, from [[diabetes]] at [[Chandos House]], London. His illness was unexpected and not originally thought to be serious; the House of Lords postponed voting on several bills until he recovered. Within a week, however, his illness proved fatal, despite the efforts of Dr. Henry Walter Kiallmark, the family physician, and Sir [[James Paget]], who was called in to assist.<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nThe duke was buried at the family vault in the church at [[Wotton House]], Buckinghamshire.<ref name=\"funeral\"/>\n\nWith no male issue, the dukedom and marquessate of Buckingham and Chandos and the Earldom of Temple became extinct. Several of his other titles survived due to available heirs: his nephew [[William Temple-Gore-Langton, 4th Earl Temple of Stowe|William Gore-Langton]] succeeded him in 1892 as fourth [[Earl Temple of Stowe]], which was created with a [[Remainder (law)#Special remainder in peerages|special remainder]]; his eldest daughter, [[Mary Morgan-Grenville, 11th Lady Kinloss|Lady Mary]], succeeded him in the Scottish [[Lord Kinloss|lordship of Kinloss]], which can be held by females as Lady Kinloss; and his distant relative [[Charles Lyttelton, 8th Viscount Cobham|Charles Lyttelton]] succeeded him as eighth [[Viscount Cobham]].<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\n==Family==\n[[File:3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos.png|thumb|right|150px|The Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]], 1875.]]\n\nBuckingham married firstly Caroline Harvey, daughter of Robert Harvey of Langley Park, Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, and sister of [[Sir Robert Harvey, 1st Baronet of Langley Park]], in 1851. They had three daughters:\n* [[Mary Morgan-Grenville, 11th Lady Kinloss]] (1852\u20131944)\n* Lady Anne (1853\u20131890)\n* Lady Caroline Jemima Elizabeth (1858\u20131946)\n\nCaroline, Duchess of Buckingham and Chandos, died in February 1874.\n\nBuckingham married, secondly, Alice Graham-Montgomery, daughter of [[Sir Graham Graham-Montgomery, 3rd Baronet]], in 1885. Born in 1848, she was 25 years younger than him. In 1897, she was one of the guests at the Duchess of Devonshire's Diamond Jubilee Costume Ball.<ref>{{cite web| last=Walker| first=Dave| title=Costume Ball 4: Ladies only| url=http://rbkclocalstudies.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/costume-ball-4-ladies-only/| publisher=Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea}}</ref> There were no children from this marriage.

As writer [[Eddie Holland]] explained, \"He was the only singer I have ever heard known to take a song of that nature, that was so far removed from his natural voice where he liked singing, and do whatever it took to sell that song.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981 |date=April 2006 |page=8}}</ref>\n\nIn songs such as \"Pride and Joy\", Gaye used three different vocal ranges\u2014singing in his baritone range at the beginning, bringing a lighter tenor in the verses before reaching a gospel mode in the chorus. Holland further stated of Gaye's voice that it was \"...one of the sweetest and prettiest voices you ever wanted to hear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981 |date=April 2006 |page=9}}</ref> And while he noted that ballads and jazz was \"his basic soul\", he stated Gaye \"...had the ability to take a roughhouse, rock and roll, blues, R&B, any kind of song and make it his own\", later saying that Gaye was the most versatile vocalist he had ever worked with.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nGaye changed his vocal style in the late 1960s, when he was advised to use a sharper, raspy voice\u2014especially in Norman Whitfield's recordings. Gaye initially disliked the new style, considering it out of his range, but said he was \"into being produce-able.\"<ref name=\"Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing\"/> After listening to David Ruffin and Levi Stubbs, Gaye said he started to develop what he called his \"tough man voice\"\u2014saying, \"I developed a growl.\"<ref name=\"Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing\"/>{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=100}} In the liner notes of his DVD set, ''Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981'', Rob Bowman said that by the early 1970s, Gaye had developed \"three distinct voices: his smooth, sweet tenor; a growling rasp; and an unreal [[falsetto]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981 |date=April 2006 |page=15}}</ref> Bowman further wrote that the recording of the ''What's Going On'' single was \"...the first single to utilize all three as Marvin developed a radical approach to constructing his recordings by layering a series of contrapuntal background vocal lines on different tracks, each one conceived and sung in isolation by Marvin himself.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Bowman found that Gaye's multi-tracking of his tenor voice and other vocal styles \"summon[ed] up what might be termed the ancient art of weaving\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Social commentary and concept albums===\nPrior to recording the ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' album, Gaye recorded a cover of the song, \"[[Abraham, Martin & John]]\", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary,{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} including [[Curtis Mayfield]]. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by [[The Temptations]] in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social events such as the 1965 [[Watts riots]] and once asked himself, \"with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=156}} When the singer called Gordy in the Bahamas about wanting to do [[protest music]], Gordy cautioned him, \"Marvin, don't be ridiculous. That's taking things too far.\"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=157}}\n\nGaye was inspired by the [[Black Panther Party]] and supported the efforts they put forth like giving free meals to poor families door to door. However, he did not support the violent tactics the Panthers used to fight oppression, as Gaye's messages in many of his political songs were [[nonviolent]]. The lyrics and music of ''What's Going On'' discuss and illustrate issues during the 1960s/1970s such as police brutality, drug abuse, environmental issues, anti-war, and black power issues.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Party Music : The Inside Story of the Black Panthers' Band and How Black Power Transformed Soul Music|last = Vincet|first = Rickey|publisher = Lawrence Hill Books|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 288\u2013289}}</ref> Gaye was inspired to make this album because of events such as the [[Vietnam War]], the [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 race riots in Detroit]], and the [[Kent State shootings]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |title=Things Aint Like What They Used to Be: Marvin Gaye and The Making of What's Going On |last=Charnock |first=Ruth |date=2015 |journal=United Academics Journal of Social Sciences |doi= |pmid= |access-date= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120111436/http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOnce Gaye presented Gordy with the ''What's Going On'' album, Gordy feared Gaye was risking the ruination of his image as a sex symbol.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Following the album's success, Gaye tried a follow-up album that he would label ''[[You're the Man (album)|You're the Man]]''. The [[You're the Man|title track]] only produced modest success, however, and Gaye and Motown shelved the album. Later on, several of Gaye's unreleased songs of social commentary, including \"[[The World Is Rated X]]\", would be issued on posthumous compilation albums.

This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Barry White]] making the concept album format a part of 1970s R&B music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. ''Let's Get It On'' repeated the suite-form arrangement of ''What's Going On'', as would Gaye's later albums such as ''I Want You'', ''Here, My Dear'' and ''In Our Lifetime''.\n\nAlthough Marvin Gaye was not politically active outside of his music, he became a public figure for social change and inspired/educated many people through his work.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nMarvin Gaye has been called \"the number-one purveyor of soul music\".{{sfn|Browne|2001|p=316}} In his book ''Mercy Mercy Me: The Art, Loves and Demons of Marvin Gaye'', [[Michael Eric Dyson]] described Gaye as someone \"...who transcended the boundaries of [[rhythm and blues]] as no other performer had done before.\"{{sfn|Dyson|2004|p=3}} Following his [[death of Marvin Gaye|death]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Gaye as someone who \"blended the soul music of the urban scene with the beat of the old-time gospel singer and became an influential force in pop music\".<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |title=Marvin Gaye Is Shot And Killed; Pop Singer's Father Faces Charge |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 1, 1984 |access-date=March 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403100807/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |archive-date=April 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further in the article, Gaye was also credited with combining \"the soulful directness of gospel music, the sweetness of soft-soul and pop, and the vocal musicianship of a jazz singer.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> His recordings for Motown in the 1960s and 1970s shaped that label's signature sound.

He changed his tone to a rasp for his gospel-inspired early hits such as \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\" and \"Hitch Hike\". As writer [[Eddie Holland]] explained, \"He was the only singer I have ever heard known to take a song of that nature, that was so far removed from his natural voice where he liked singing, and do whatever it took to sell that song.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981 |date=April 2006 |page=8}}</ref>\n\nIn songs such as \"Pride and Joy\", Gaye used three different vocal ranges\u2014singing in his baritone range at the beginning, bringing a lighter tenor in the verses before reaching a gospel mode in the chorus. Holland further stated of Gaye's voice that it was \"...one of the sweetest and prettiest voices you ever wanted to hear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981 |date=April 2006 |page=9}}</ref> And while he noted that ballads and jazz was \"his basic soul\", he stated Gaye \"...had the ability to take a roughhouse, rock and roll, blues, R&B, any kind of song and make it his own\", later saying that Gaye was the most versatile vocalist he had ever worked with.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nGaye changed his vocal style in the late 1960s, when he was advised to use a sharper, raspy voice\u2014especially in Norman Whitfield's recordings. Gaye initially disliked the new style, considering it out of his range, but said he was \"into being produce-able.\"<ref name=\"Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing\"/> After listening to David Ruffin and Levi Stubbs, Gaye said he started to develop what he called his \"tough man voice\"\u2014saying, \"I developed a growl.\"<ref name=\"Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing\"/>{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=100}} In the liner notes of his DVD set, ''Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981'', Rob Bowman said that by the early 1970s, Gaye had developed \"three distinct voices: his smooth, sweet tenor; a growling rasp; and an unreal [[falsetto]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981 |date=April 2006 |page=15}}</ref> Bowman further wrote that the recording of the ''What's Going On'' single was \"...the first single to utilize all three as Marvin developed a radical approach to constructing his recordings by layering a series of contrapuntal background vocal lines on different tracks, each one conceived and sung in isolation by Marvin himself.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Bowman found that Gaye's multi-tracking of his tenor voice and other vocal styles \"summon[ed] up what might be termed the ancient art of weaving\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Social commentary and concept albums===\nPrior to recording the ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' album, Gaye recorded a cover of the song, \"[[Abraham, Martin & John]]\", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary,{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} including [[Curtis Mayfield]]. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by [[The Temptations]] in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social events such as the 1965 [[Watts riots]] and once asked himself, \"with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=156}} When the singer called Gordy in the Bahamas about wanting to do [[protest music]], Gordy cautioned him, \"Marvin, don't be ridiculous. That's taking things too far.\"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=157}}\n\nGaye was inspired by the [[Black Panther Party]] and supported the efforts they put forth like giving free meals to poor families door to door. However, he did not support the violent tactics the Panthers used to fight oppression, as Gaye's messages in many of his political songs were [[nonviolent]]. The lyrics and music of ''What's Going On'' discuss and illustrate issues during the 1960s/1970s such as police brutality, drug abuse, environmental issues, anti-war, and black power issues.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Party Music : The Inside Story of the Black Panthers' Band and How Black Power Transformed Soul Music|last = Vincet|first = Rickey|publisher = Lawrence Hill Books|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 288\u2013289}}</ref> Gaye was inspired to make this album because of events such as the [[Vietnam War]], the [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 race riots in Detroit]], and the [[Kent State shootings]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |title=Things Aint Like What They Used to Be: Marvin Gaye and The Making of What's Going On |last=Charnock |first=Ruth |date=2015 |journal=United Academics Journal of Social Sciences |doi= |pmid= |access-date= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120111436/http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOnce Gaye presented Gordy with the ''What's Going On'' album, Gordy feared Gaye was risking the ruination of his image as a sex symbol.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Following the album's success, Gaye tried a follow-up album that he would label ''[[You're the Man (album)|You're the Man]]''. The [[You're the Man|title track]] only produced modest success, however, and Gaye and Motown shelved the album. Later on, several of Gaye's unreleased songs of social commentary, including \"[[The World Is Rated X]]\", would be issued on posthumous compilation albums. ''What's Going On'' would later be described by an [[AllMusic]] writer as an album that \"not only redefined soul music as a creative force but also expanded its impact as an agent for social change\".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4344/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic (((Marvin Gaye \u2013 Overview)))|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}</ref>  ''You're the Man'' was finally released on March 29, 2019, through [[Motown]], [[Universal Music Enterprises]], and [[Universal Music Group]].<ref name=\"CoS\">{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/02/marvin-gaye-youre-the-man-official-release/|title=Marvin Gaye's lost 1972 album You're the Man to receive official release|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|last=Roffman|first=Michael|date=February 8, 2019|accessdate=February 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209124247/https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/02/marvin-gaye-youre-the-man-official-release/|archive-date=February 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe ''What's Going On'' album also provided another first in both Motown and R&B music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album in a [[song cycle]], segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R&B albums that traditionally included [[filler (music)|filler tracks]] to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Barry White]] making the concept album format a part of 1970s R&B music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. ''Let's Get It On'' repeated the suite-form arrangement of ''What's Going On'', as would Gaye's later albums such as ''I Want You'', ''Here, My Dear'' and ''In Our Lifetime''.\n\nAlthough Marvin Gaye was not politically active outside of his music, he became a public figure for social change and inspired/educated many people through his work.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nMarvin Gaye has been called \"the number-one purveyor of soul music\".{{sfn|Browne|2001|p=316}} In his book ''Mercy Mercy Me: The Art, Loves and Demons of Marvin Gaye'', [[Michael Eric Dyson]] described Gaye as someone \"...who transcended the boundaries of [[rhythm and blues]] as no other performer had done before.\"{{sfn|Dyson|2004|p=3}} Following his [[death of Marvin Gaye|death]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Gaye as someone who \"blended the soul music of the urban scene with the beat of the old-time gospel singer and became an influential force in pop music\".<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |title=Marvin Gaye Is Shot And Killed; Pop Singer's Father Faces Charge |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 1, 1984 |access-date=March 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403100807/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |archive-date=April 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further in the article, Gaye was also credited with combining \"the soulful directness of gospel music, the sweetness of soft-soul and pop, and the vocal musicianship of a jazz singer.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> His recordings for Motown in the 1960s and 1970s shaped that label's signature sound.
