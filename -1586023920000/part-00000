The degrees of Freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft [[guild]]s, those of [[Apprenticeship|Apprentice]], [[Journeyman]] or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and [[Master craftsman|Master Mason]]. The candidate of these three degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry, and entrusted with grips, signs and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated. The degrees are part allegorical [[morality play]] and part lecture. Three degrees are offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry, and members of any of these degrees are known as '''Freemasons''' or '''Masons'''. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by their own bodies (separate from those who administer the Craft degrees).\n\nThe basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge]]. These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level (usually coterminous with either a state, province, or national border) by a [[Grand Lodge]] or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.\n\nModern Freemasonry broadly consists of two main recognition groups.

The process varies between jurisdictions, but the candidate will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.<ref name=\"MLoE\">[http://www.masonic-lodge-of-education.com/become-a-free-mason.html \"How to become a Freemason\"], ''Masonic Lodge of Education'', retrieved 20 November 2013</ref>\n\nThe absolute minimum requirement of any body of Freemasons is that the candidate must be free, and considered to be of good character.<ref>[http://grande-loge.lu/?page_id=223 \"Comment devenir franc-ma\u00e7on?\"], Grande Loge de Luxembourg, retrieved 23 November 2013</ref> There is usually an age requirement, varying greatly between Grand Lodges, and (in some jurisdictions) capable of being overridden by a dispensation from the Grand Lodge.

If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge.

Each Grand Lodge sets its own definition of what these landmarks are, and thus what is Regular and what is Irregular (and the definitions do not necessarily agree between Grand Lodges). Essentially, every Grand Lodge will hold that ''its'' landmarks (its requirements, tenets and rituals) are Regular, and judge other Grand Lodges based on those.

Cooper, ''Cracking the Freemason's Code'', Rider 2006, p229</ref>\n\nThe Ancient and Accepted [[Scottish Rite]] is a system of 33 degrees (including the three Blue Lodge degrees) administered by a local or national Supreme Council. This system is popular in [[North America]], [[South America]] and in [[Continental Europe]]. In America, the [[York Rite]], with a similar range, administers three orders of Masonry, namely the [[Royal Arch Masonry|Royal Arch]], [[Cryptic Masonry]], and [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Knights Templar]].<ref>Michael Johnstone, ''The Freemasons'', Arcturus, 2005, pp 95\u201398</ref>\n\nIn Britain, separate bodies administer each order. Freemasons are encouraged to join the [[Holy Royal Arch]], which is linked to [[Order of Mark Master Masons|Mark Masonry]] in Scotland and Ireland, but completely separate in England. In England, the Royal Arch is closely associated with the Craft, automatically having many Grand Officers in common, including H.R.H the [[Duke of Kent]] as both Grand Master of the Craft and First Grand Principal of the Royal Arch.

Moral lessons are attributed to each of these tools, although the assignment is by no means consistent. The meaning of the symbolism is taught and explored through ritual,<ref name=\"Johnstone\" /> and in lectures and articles by individual masons who offer their personal insights and opinions.\n\nAll Freemasons begin their journey in the \"craft\" by being progressively \"initiated\", \"passed\" and \"raised\" into the three degrees of Craft, or Blue Lodge Masonry. During these three rituals, the candidate is progressively taught the Masonic symbols, and entrusted with grips or tokens, signs and words to signify to other Masons which degrees he has taken. The dramatic allegorical ceremonies include explanatory lectures, and revolve around the construction of the [[Temple of Solomon]], and the artistry and death of the chief architect, [[Hiram Abiff]]. The degrees are those of \"Entered apprentice\", \"Fellowcraft\" and \"Master Mason\". While many different versions of these rituals exist, with various lodge layouts and versions of the Hiramic legend, each version is recognisable to any Freemason from any jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Johnstone\" />\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the main themes of each degree are illustrated by [[tracing board]]s. These painted depictions of Masonic themes are exhibited in the lodge according to which degree is being worked, and are explained to the candidate to illustrate the legend and symbolism of each degree.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/gmd1999/tb_history01.html Mark S.

When the British military Lodge left North America after the end of the Revolution, those 15 men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons. In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Premier Grand Lodge of England (GLE) and formed African Lodge, Number 459. When the [[UGLE]] was formed in 1813, all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls&nbsp;\u2013 due largely to the [[War of 1812]]. Thus, separated from both UGLE and any concordantly recognised U.S. Grand Lodge, African Lodge retitled itself as the African Lodge, Number 1&nbsp;\u2013 and became a ''de facto'' Grand Lodge.

From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe during the course of the 18th century. The Grande Loge de France formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who exercised only nominal authority. His successor, the [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773. Briefly eclipsed during the [[French Revolution]], French Freemasonry continued to grow in the next century,<ref>[http://www.godf.org/index.php/pages/details/slug/histoire-de-la-franc-maconnerie ''Histoire de la Franc-ma\u00e7onnerie''], Grand Orient de France, retrieved 12 November 2013</ref> at first under the leadership of [[Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse]], Comte de Grassy-Tilly.

However the two jurisdictions continued in amity (mutual recognition) until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them. In 1868 the ''Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the State of Louisiana'' appeared in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, recognised by the Grand Orient de France, but regarded by the older body as an invasion of their jurisdiction. The new Scottish Rite body admitted blacks. The resolution of the Grand Orient the following year that neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry prompted the Grand Lodge to withdraw recognition, and it persuaded other American Grand Lodges to do the same.<ref>[http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm Paul Bessel, \"U.S. Recognition of French Grand Lodges in the 1900s\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410074658/http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm |date=10 April 2006 }}, from ''Heredom: The Transactions of the Scottish Rite Research Society'', vol 5, 1996, pp 221\u2013244, ''Paul Bessel'' website, retrieved 12 November 2013</ref>\n\nA dispute during the [[Lausanne Congress of Supreme Councils of 1875]] prompted the Grand Orient de France to commission a report by a Protestant pastor which concluded that, as Freemasonry was not a religion, it should not require a religious belief. The new constitutions read, \"Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity\", the existence of God and the immortality of the soul being struck out. It is possible that the immediate objections of the United Grand Lodge of England were at least partly motivated by the political tension between France and Britain at the time. The result was the withdrawal of recognition of the Grand Orient of France by the United Grand Lodge of England, a situation that continues today.<ref name=\"Buta\"/>\n\nNot all French lodges agreed with the new wording.

In 1961, an umbrella organisation, [[Centre de Liaison et d'Information des Puissances ma\u00e7onniques Signataires de l'Appel de Strasbourg]] (CLIPSAS) was set up, which today provides a forum for most of these Grand Lodges and Grand Orients worldwide. Included in the list of over 70 Grand Lodges and Grand Orients are representatives of all three of the above categories, including mixed and women's organisations.

The two main organisation were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy. They had 25,000 members in 500 or more lodges. Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, public opinion and the leading political parties in support of [[Italian entry into World War I|Italy's joining the Allies]] of the First World War in 1914\u20131915. Traditionally, they promoted Italian nationalism focused on unification, and undermining the power of the Catholic Church. In 1914-15 they dropped the traditional pacifistic rhetoric and used instead the powerful language of [[Italian nationalism]]. Freemasonry had always promoted cosmopolitan universal values, and by 1917 onwards they demanded a [[League of Nations]] to promote a new post-war universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations.<ref>Fulvio Conti, \"From Universalism to Nationalism: Italian Freemasonry and the Great War.\" ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 20.5 (2015): 640-662.</ref>\n\n===Freemasonry and women===\n{{Main|Freemasonry and women|Co-Freemasonry}}\n\nThe status of women in the old guilds and corporations of medieval masons remains uncertain.

The degrees of Freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft [[guild]]s, those of [[Apprenticeship|Apprentice]], [[Journeyman]] or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and [[Master craftsman|Master Mason]]. The candidate of these three degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry, and entrusted with grips, signs and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated. The degrees are part allegorical [[morality play]] and part lecture. Three degrees are offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry, and members of any of these degrees are known as '''Freemasons''' or '''Masons'''. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by their own bodies (separate from those who administer the Craft degrees).\n\nThe basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge]]. These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level (usually coterminous with either a state, province, or national border) by a [[Grand Lodge]] or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.\n\nModern Freemasonry broadly consists of two main recognition groups. [[Regular Freemasonry]] insists that a volume of scripture be open in a working lodge, that every member profess belief in a [[Supreme Being]], that no women be admitted (although, in some jurisdictions, those who [[Transitioning (transgender)|transition]] to women after being initiated may stay; see below), and that the discussion of religion and politics be banned. [[Continental Freemasonry]] is now the general term for the jurisdictions which have removed some, or all, of these restrictions.\n\nFreemasonry has been subject to numerous conspiracy theories throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.freemason.org/newsEvents/article.htm?id=10723}}</ref>\n\n==Masonic Lodge==\n[[File:Palazzo Roffia, galleria 00.JPG|thumb|alt=Italian lodge at Palazzo Roffia, Florence|Lodge in Palazzo Roffia, [[Florence]], set out for French (Moderns) ritual]]\n{{Main|Masonic lodge}}\nThe [[Masonic lodge]] is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chevalierramsay.be/what-is-freemasonry/|title=What is Freemasonry|website=www.chevalierramsay.be|access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref> The Lodge meets regularly to conduct the usual formal business of any small organisation (pay bills, organise social and charitable events, elect new members, etc.).

Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively ''initiated'' into Freemasonry, first in the degree of Entered Apprentice. Some time later, in a separate ceremony, they will be ''passed'' to the degree of Fellowcraft, and finally they will be ''raised'' to the degree of Master Mason. In all of these ceremonies, the candidate is first obligated, then entrusted with passwords, signs and grips ([[secret handshake]]s) peculiar to his new rank.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/mas/syma/syma22.htm \"Words, Grips and Signs\"] H.

There also exist specialist Lodges where Masons meet to celebrate events, such as sport or Masonic research.

Other offices vary between jurisdictions.<ref name=\"Johnstone\" />\n\nEach Masonic Lodge exists and operates according to a set of ancient principles known as the ''Landmarks of Freemasonry''. These principles have thus far eluded any universally accepted definition.<ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/bernheim27.html Alain Bernheim, \"My Approach to Masonic History\"], ''Pietre Stones'', from address of 2011, retrieved 8 November 2013</ref>\n\n===Joining a lodge===\n[[File:Washington Masonic print.jpg|thumb|alt=Worshipful Master George Washington|Print from 1870 portraying [[George Washington]] as Master of his Lodge]]\n\nCandidates for Freemasonry will have met most active members of the Lodge they are joining before they are initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the candidate will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.<ref name=\"MLoE\">[http://www.masonic-lodge-of-education.com/become-a-free-mason.html \"How to become a Freemason\"], ''Masonic Lodge of Education'', retrieved 20 November 2013</ref>\n\nThe absolute minimum requirement of any body of Freemasons is that the candidate must be free, and considered to be of good character.<ref>[http://grande-loge.lu/?page_id=223 \"Comment devenir franc-ma\u00e7on?\"], Grande Loge de Luxembourg, retrieved 23 November 2013</ref> There is usually an age requirement, varying greatly between Grand Lodges, and (in some jurisdictions) capable of being overridden by a dispensation from the Grand Lodge. The underlying assumption is that the candidate should be a mature adult.<ref name=\"MLoE\"/>\n\nAdditionally, most Grand Lodges require the candidate to declare a belief in a [[Supreme Being]]. In a few cases, the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion. The form of Freemasonry most common in Scandinavia (known as the [[Swedish Rite]]), for example, accepts only Christians.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/swedish_faq.html \"Swedish Rite FAQ\"], ''Grand Lodge of British Columbia & Yukon'', Accessed 19 November 2013</ref> At the other end of the spectrum, \"Liberal\" or [[Continental Freemasonry]], exemplified by the [[Grand Orient de France]], does not require a declaration of belief in any deity, and accepts atheists (a cause of discord with the rest of Freemasonry).<ref>[http://www.godf.org/index.php/pages/details/slug/foire-aux-questions \"Faut-il croire en Dieu?\"], Foire aux Questions, ''Grand Orient de France'', Retrieved 23 November 2013</ref><ref name=\"Buta\">[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/masonic_foreign_recognitions.html Jack Buta, \"The God Conspiracy, The Politics of Grand Lodge Foreign Relations\"], ''Pietre-Stones'', retrieved 23 November 2013</ref>\n\nDuring the ceremony of initiation, the candidate is expected to undertake or swear (usually on a volume of sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit).<ref name=\"Johnstone\"/> There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will simply enjoy the dramatics or the management and administration of the lodge, others will further explore the ritual and symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on their Lodge's social side, perhaps in association with other lodges, while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions of the lodge.<ref>[http://www.hampshirefreemasonry.com/social-events-and-activities \"Social events and activities\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109021223/http://www.hampshirefreemasonry.com/social-events-and-activities |date=9 January 2014 }}, ''Hampshire Province'', retrieved 20 November 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.masonic-lodges.com/masons.html \"Who are Masons, and what do they do?\"], ''MasonicLodges.com'', retrieved 20 November 2013</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Grand Lodges===\n[[File:Freemasons' Hall, London.JPG|thumb|alt=Freemason's Hall, London|[[Freemasons' Hall, London|Freemasons Hall]], London, home of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]]]]\n{{Main|Grand Lodge}}\nGrand Lodges and Grand Orients are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry in a given country, state, or geographical area (termed a ''jurisdiction'').

There are many reasons one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are ''Exclusive Jurisdiction'' and ''Regularity''.<ref>[http://www.pilarlodge3freemasonry.freeservers.com/about_1.html Jim Bantolo, \"On Recognition\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314135120/http://www.pilarlodge3freemasonry.freeservers.com/about_1.html |date=14 March 2008 }}, Masonic Short Talk, ''Pilar lodge'', 2007, retrieved 25 November 2013</ref>\n\n====Exclusive Jurisdiction====\nExclusive Jurisdiction is a concept whereby normally only one Grand Lodge will be recognised in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.<ref>[http://www.themasonictrowel.com/ebooks/fm_freemasonry/Lang_-_History_Of_Freemasonry_in_NewYork_1922_raw.pdf Ossian Lang, \"History of Freemasonry in the State of New York\" (pdf)], 1922, pp135-140, ''Masonic Trowel eBooks''</ref>) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two overlapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both,<ref>[http://www.bessel.org/exclartl.htm \"Exclusive Jurisdiction\"], ''Paul M.

Each Grand Lodge sets its own definition of what these landmarks are, and thus what is Regular and what is Irregular (and the definitions do not necessarily agree between Grand Lodges). Essentially, every Grand Lodge will hold that ''its'' landmarks (its requirements, tenets and rituals) are Regular, and judge other Grand Lodges based on those. If the differences are significant, one Grand Lodge may declare the other \"Irregular\" and withdraw or withhold recognition.<ref>[http://www.masonicum.lv/index.php?p=8857&lang=1506&pp=13574 \"Regularity in Freemasonry and its Meaning\"], ''Grand Lodge of Latvia'', retrieved 25 November 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/pope4.html Tony Pope, \"Regularity and Recognition\"], from ''Freemasonry Universal'', by Kent Henderson & Tony Pope, 1998, ''Pietre Stones'' website, retrieved 25 November 2013</ref>\n\nThe most commonly shared rules for Recognition (based on Regularity) are those given by the United Grand Lodge of England in 1929:\n* The Grand Lodge should be established by an existing regular Grand Lodge, or by at least three regular Lodges.\n* A belief in a supreme being and scripture is a condition of membership.\n* Initiates should take their vows on that scripture.\n* Only men can be admitted, and no relationship exists with mixed Lodges.\n* The Grand Lodge has complete control over the first three degrees, and is not subject to another body.\n* All Lodges shall display a volume of scripture with the square and compasses while in session.\n* There is no discussion of politics or religion.\n* \"Antient landmarks, customs and usages\" observed.<ref>''UGLE Book of Constitutions'', \"Basic Principles for Grand Lodge Recognition\", any year since 1930, page numbers may vary.</ref>\n\n==Other degrees, orders, and bodies==\n{{See also|Masonic bodies|List of Masonic rites}}\nBlue Lodge (a term not used in the United Kingdom, which simply refers to the Craft) basic Freemasonry offers only three traditional degrees and, in most jurisdictions, the rank of past or installed master.

Cooper, ''Cracking the Freemason's Code'', Rider 2006, p229</ref>\n\nThe Ancient and Accepted [[Scottish Rite]] is a system of 33 degrees (including the three Blue Lodge degrees) administered by a local or national Supreme Council. This system is popular in [[North America]], [[South America]] and in [[Continental Europe]]. In America, the [[York Rite]], with a similar range, administers three orders of Masonry, namely the [[Royal Arch Masonry|Royal Arch]], [[Cryptic Masonry]], and [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Knights Templar]].<ref>Michael Johnstone, ''The Freemasons'', Arcturus, 2005, pp 95\u201398</ref>\n\nIn Britain, separate bodies administer each order. Freemasons are encouraged to join the [[Holy Royal Arch]], which is linked to [[Order of Mark Master Masons|Mark Masonry]] in Scotland and Ireland, but completely separate in England. In England, the Royal Arch is closely associated with the Craft, automatically having many Grand Officers in common, including H.R.H the [[Duke of Kent]] as both Grand Master of the Craft and First Grand Principal of the Royal Arch.

Moral lessons are attributed to each of these tools, although the assignment is by no means consistent. The meaning of the symbolism is taught and explored through ritual,<ref name=\"Johnstone\" /> and in lectures and articles by individual masons who offer their personal insights and opinions.\n\nAll Freemasons begin their journey in the \"craft\" by being progressively \"initiated\", \"passed\" and \"raised\" into the three degrees of Craft, or Blue Lodge Masonry. During these three rituals, the candidate is progressively taught the Masonic symbols, and entrusted with grips or tokens, signs and words to signify to other Masons which degrees he has taken. The dramatic allegorical ceremonies include explanatory lectures, and revolve around the construction of the [[Temple of Solomon]], and the artistry and death of the chief architect, [[Hiram Abiff]]. The degrees are those of \"Entered apprentice\", \"Fellowcraft\" and \"Master Mason\". While many different versions of these rituals exist, with various lodge layouts and versions of the Hiramic legend, each version is recognisable to any Freemason from any jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Johnstone\" />\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the main themes of each degree are illustrated by [[tracing board]]s. These painted depictions of Masonic themes are exhibited in the lodge according to which degree is being worked, and are explained to the candidate to illustrate the legend and symbolism of each degree.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/gmd1999/tb_history01.html Mark S.

When the British military Lodge left North America after the end of the Revolution, those 15 men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons. In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Premier Grand Lodge of England (GLE) and formed African Lodge, Number 459. When the [[UGLE]] was formed in 1813, all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls&nbsp;\u2013 due largely to the [[War of 1812]]. Thus, separated from both UGLE and any concordantly recognised U.S. Grand Lodge, African Lodge retitled itself as the African Lodge, Number 1&nbsp;\u2013 and became a ''de facto'' Grand Lodge.

From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe during the course of the 18th century. The Grande Loge de France formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who exercised only nominal authority. His successor, the [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773. Briefly eclipsed during the [[French Revolution]], French Freemasonry continued to grow in the next century,<ref>[http://www.godf.org/index.php/pages/details/slug/histoire-de-la-franc-maconnerie ''Histoire de la Franc-ma\u00e7onnerie''], Grand Orient de France, retrieved 12 November 2013</ref> at first under the leadership of [[Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse]], Comte de Grassy-Tilly. A career Army officer, he had lived with his family in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] from 1793 to the early 1800s, after leaving [[Saint-Domingue]] (now Haiti) during the years of the [[Haitian Revolution]].\n\n====Schism====\n\nThe ritual form on which the Grand Orient of France was based was abolished in England in the events leading to the formation of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] in 1813. However the two jurisdictions continued in amity (mutual recognition) until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them. In 1868 the ''Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the State of Louisiana'' appeared in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, recognised by the Grand Orient de France, but regarded by the older body as an invasion of their jurisdiction. The new Scottish Rite body admitted blacks. The resolution of the Grand Orient the following year that neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry prompted the Grand Lodge to withdraw recognition, and it persuaded other American Grand Lodges to do the same.<ref>[http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm Paul Bessel, \"U.S. Recognition of French Grand Lodges in the 1900s\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410074658/http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm |date=10 April 2006 }}, from ''Heredom: The Transactions of the Scottish Rite Research Society'', vol 5, 1996, pp 221\u2013244, ''Paul Bessel'' website, retrieved 12 November 2013</ref>\n\nA dispute during the [[Lausanne Congress of Supreme Councils of 1875]] prompted the Grand Orient de France to commission a report by a Protestant pastor which concluded that, as Freemasonry was not a religion, it should not require a religious belief. The new constitutions read, \"Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity\", the existence of God and the immortality of the soul being struck out. It is possible that the immediate objections of the United Grand Lodge of England were at least partly motivated by the political tension between France and Britain at the time. The result was the withdrawal of recognition of the Grand Orient of France by the United Grand Lodge of England, a situation that continues today.<ref name=\"Buta\"/>\n\nNot all French lodges agreed with the new wording.

For the Continental lodges, however, having a different approach to Freemasonry was not a reason for severing masonic ties. In 1961, an umbrella organisation, [[Centre de Liaison et d'Information des Puissances ma\u00e7onniques Signataires de l'Appel de Strasbourg]] (CLIPSAS) was set up, which today provides a forum for most of these Grand Lodges and Grand Orients worldwide. Included in the list of over 70 Grand Lodges and Grand Orients are representatives of all three of the above categories, including mixed and women's organisations.

The two main organisation were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy. They had 25,000 members in 500 or more lodges. Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, public opinion and the leading political parties in support of [[Italian entry into World War I|Italy's joining the Allies]] of the First World War in 1914-1915. Traditionally, they promoted Italian nationalism focused on unification, and undermining the power of the Catholic Church. In 1914-15 they dropped the traditional pacifistic rhetoric and used instead the powerful language of [[Italian nationalism]]. Freemasonry had always promoted cosmopolitan universal values, and by 1917 onwards they demanded a [[League of Nations]] to promote a new post-war universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations.<ref>Fulvio Conti, \"From Universalism to Nationalism: Italian Freemasonry and the Great War.\" ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 20.5 (2015): 640-662.</ref>\n\n===Freemasonry and women===\n{{Main|Freemasonry and women|Co-Freemasonry}}\n\nThe status of women in the old guilds and corporations of medieval masons remains uncertain.

At an early age Spindler decided to go to sea rather than to join the family business, serving for a period as a watch officer on a Lloyd line steamship. He subsequently enlisted in the marine school in [[Bremen]] and the naval academy in [[Sonderburg]] (now in Denmark, but then in Germany). He served on several ships of the [[German Imperial Navy]] and at the outbreak of [[World War I|the Great War]], he was commanding the [[RV Polarstern|Polarstern]], a guardship for the port of [[Wilhelmshaven]].\n\n==Naval career==\nOn 20 March 1916, Spindler was given instructions by his senior officer to undertake a highly secretive and dangerous mission on board a disguised merchant ship and to pick five officers and a crew of 16 to join him on the journey. He was given command of a vessel named ''[[SS Libau|Libau]]'',<ref>[http://corkshipwrecks.net/1916Aud.htm Shipwrecks of Cork Harbour] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130624220152/http://corkshipwrecks.net/1916Aud.htm |date=2013-06-24 }}</ref> falsely renamed ''[[SS Aud|Aud]]'', a Norwegian freighter of similar appearance. It was to carry a cargo of German arms to the west coast of Ireland along with a passenger, Sir [[Roger Casement]], as part of a plan to assist [[Irish Republican Army|Irish republicans]] in staging what would become the [[Easter Rising|1916 Easter Rising]]. \n\nSpindler travelled to [[Berlin]] for further orders and met Casement. However, Casement preferred to travel onboard the submarine which would accompany the ''Libau.'' Casement was later set ashore by the submarine at [[Banna Strand]] in [[County Kerry|Co. Kerry]] via a small collapsible boat. However, Casement was arrested soon afterwards on [[Good Friday]], 21 April 1916, and taken prisoner in the [[Tower of London]] on charges of [[High treason in the United Kingdom|High Treason]] against the [[United Kingdom]]. He was subsequently executed by hanging at [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville Prison]] on 3 August 1916. The uprising had failed. \n\nSpindler's ship was intercepted by British naval vessels near the [[Blasket Islands]] and forced to sail for [[Cobh]] (then known as Queenstown) where there was a major British naval base. Spindler instructed his crew to open the ship's sea-valves and blow an explosive charge in the hold. As they left the sinking ship the crew took down the false Norwegian flag she was flying and hoisted the [[:File:Flag of the German Empire.svg|German Imperial flag]] in its place. They boarded two [[Dinghy|dinghies]] and were taken as [[Prisoner of war|British prisoners of war]] to [[Donington Hall]]. \n\nFrom there they later escaped only to be recaptured the following day.

{"title_page": "History of Freemasonry in Belgium", "text_new": "{{mergeto|Freemasonry in Belgium|date=March 2020}}\n{{Freemasonry}}\nThe '''history of [[Freemasonry]] in Belgium''' reflects the many influences on what is now Belgium from the neighbouring states.\n\n==18th century==\nIn the 18th century, Belgium was made up of 2 states - the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]].\n\n===Austrian Netherlands===\nFreemasonry in the Austrian Netherlands was very varied in its origins and expressions.  The source of this fragmentation was to be found particularly in the complexity of its institutions, the influence of the government or surrounding powers, and its very deeply rooted local sense of identity.\n\nThe first Belgian lodge was founded in 1721 in [[Mons]], under the name \"La Parfaite Union\" (\"The Perfect Union\").  It has frequently changed its name and allegiance since then, but still exists today as number 1 of the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]].  Other, more short-lived lodges seem to have been created in [[Ghent]] and [[Tournai]] in 1730.  The first evidence of masonic activity in the provinces dates to 1743, in [[Brussels]].<ref>See De Schampheleire</ref>  This would be the \"La Discr\u00e8te Imp\u00e9riale\" (\"The Discrete Imperial\") lodge of [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] which would have number one on the tablet of the order of the Provincial Grand Lodge (Grande loge provinciale) of the Austrian Netherlands, the mother-lodge of London several times recognising it as the oldest in the region.  It disappeared with the Provincial Grand Lodge of the Austrian Netherlands.<ref>See of the AusB. Vander Schelden</ref>\n\nThanks to the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], from 1746 several lodges formed under the influence of French forces occupying the country and of the Grand Lodge of France (of which a French [[prince de sang]], [[Louis de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9 (1709-1771)|Louis de Bourbon Cond\u00e9, Comte de Clermont]], was Grand Master).  These lodges received their patents from the Grand Lodge of France, the Grand Lodge of London, the Grand Lodge of Holland or the Grand Lodge of Scotland - for example, the \"Parfaite Union\" (\"Perfect Union\") Lodge at [[Namur (city)|Namur]], one of the \"ancient\" lodges, which in 1777 became the \"Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" (\"Good Friendship\") lodge in Namur).  After the Treaty of la Barri\u00e8re in 1715, Batavian troops (also including English and Scottish troops) occupied the strongholds of the Austrian Netherlands (notably Namur, [[Tournai]], [[Veurne]], [[Ypres]], [[Warneton, Belgium|Warneton]]) for a long and difficult period, and it was probably this that led to the creation or confirmation of more lasting lodges.\n\nAnother event, within freemasonry itself, accelerated the demand for patents from the non-French masonic authorities.  Internal disputes within the Grand Lodge of France led to its suspension in 1767, a result of the Convent's secession from this Grand Lodge in Paris, having been excluded in previous years.<ref>See P. Chevalier</ref>  From then on lodges in the Austrian Netherlands came to feel isolated.  This was certainly the case for the \"Vraie et Parfaite Harmonie\" (\"True and Perfect Harmony\") lodge in Mons (English patent, received January 1770), probably also for the \"Discr\u00e8te Imp\u00e9riale\" in [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] (English patent, received June 1765) and perhaps for the  \"Parfaite Union/Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" in Namur (Scottish patent, received February 1770).  In 1770, the Provincial Grand Lodge of the Austrian Netherlands formed, dependent on the Grand Lodge of London (the \"Moderns\"), made up of 26 lodges and with the Marquis de Gage as its Grand Master.  It was centred on de Gage's own lodge \"la Vraie et Parfaite Harmonie\" in Mons, the most brilliant of the 18th century Austrian Netherlands.\n\nIt was in Brussels that Belgian Freemasonry was particularly important, with Masons frequently coming from its noble families.  Also the ULB (Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles) was also founded by several Masons, many of whom were also Catholics, following an appeal by the Lodges of Belgium.<ref>{{Request quotation|date=March 2009}} Itin\u00e9raire de la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie \u00e0 Bruxelles, Bruxelles, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 royale belge de G\u00e9ographie / Parcours ma\u00e7onnique, 2000 - (collection, Hommes et paysages ; 31)</ref>  To quote the writer Liane Ranieri<ref>Histoire de Bruxelles, Toulouse, Privat, 1976, p.352</ref>\"Originating from Brussels' Masonic lodges, Brussels' University largely benefitted from the communal [Masonic] authorities; [there were] 25 Masons out of its 31 administrators\".  An imperial edict of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] of January 1786 reduced the number of lodges in Brussels to 3 and banned them in all the other towns and cities.  The Marquis de Gage tried to stall the edict but to no avail, and on 26 June that same year he was dismissed.  Of the 3 official lodges in Brussels, only one truly continued the struggle.\n\nIt is useful to underline that the majority of 18th century lodges belonged to one man who became his lodge's President and so usually died out when he or his descendants died out.<ref name=\"Chevalier\">P. Chevalier</ref>  Examples of this include the \"Parfaite Union\" (Fonson family), \"Vraie et Parfaite harmonie\" (Marquis de Gage) and \"Union des c\u0153urs\" (\"Union of Hearts\", by the chevalier de Sicard) lodges. Others, like the \"Parfaite Union/Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" of Namur, did not have this characteristic and had presidents who succeeded each other quite regularly.  This was why Joseph II's edict more surely put to sleep the majority of lodges of this era.\n\nNevertheless, a number of lodges continued to operate in secret.  These were helped by the [[United States of Belgium|Brabant Revolution]], whose beginnings can be seen as early as 1787 and which broke out in earnest in 1789 in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].  As a result, there arose one lodge in Tournai, two in Mons, one in Namur, one in [[Antwerp]] and one in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]].\n\n====18th century lodges in Brussels====\n*One lodge, name unknown, c.1740.\n*L\u2019Union, 1742.\n*L\u2019Equit\u00e9, 1743.\n*L\u2019Union Parfaite, 1754.\n*Loge Saint-Charles.\n*La Constance de l\u2019Union, 1769.\n*La Constance Eprouv\u00e9e (20 mai 1770)\n*L\u2019Heureuse Rencontre, 1772.\n*La Parfaite Amiti\u00e9 (ou l\u2019Amiti\u00e9), 1772.\n*Les Vrais Amis de la Justice, 1775.\n*Les Vrais Amis de l\u2019Union, 1782.\n*L\u2019Union Fraternelle, 1784.\n*La Constance de l\u2019Union (or les Amis de l\u2019Union), 1784.\n\n=====[[Rite of adoption|Lodges of adoption]] (women)=====\n*La Parfaite Harmonie, 1782.\n*A l\u2019Heureuse Rencontre (Les Vrais Amis)\n*Au Chapitre de l\u2019Union, 1777.\n*Aux Vrais Amis de l\u2019Union.\n*Grande Loge de Saint-Andr\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9cosse, 1785.\n\n=====Secret Lodge=====\n*Au Pot d\u2019Etain, Grand Place.\n\n===Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge===\nThe lodges in the principality of [[Li\u00e8ge]], not submitted to the imperial edict of 1786, continued in a more classical manner.\n\nIn the principality of Li\u00e8ge, the first lodge seems to have been \"La Nymphe\" (\"The Nymph\") lodge of [[Chaudfontaine]] in 1749.  In 1760, the prince-bishop banned freemasonry, but his successor Fran\u00e7ois-Charles de Velbr\u00fcck (1772\u20131784) belonged to and protected the Order (during the 18th century, several Catholic priests were also Freemasons.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}})\n\nIn 1774 the \"Union des C\u0153urs\" lodge was founded in Li\u00e8ge by chevalier Pierre de Sicard, who had already founded several lodges from which he profited (according to U. Capitaine) - in the lodge's regulations, the cost of a mallet, an apron, a lodge rug and other Masonic equipment was precisely stipulated!  This was not the first time that the mercantile instinct had intruded into Freemasonry, with France's Grand Lodge also struggling against it at this time.  This was why, Ulysse Capitaine tells us, there was a huge transfer of \"brothers\" from this lodge to the \"la Parfaite Intelligence\" (\"The Perfect Intelligence\") lodge, created in 1775 by the [[Grand Orient de France]].  A schism quickly took place in this lodge, with the creation of the \"la Parfaite Egalit\u00e9\" (\"The Perfect Equality\") lodge, finally recognised by the Grand Orient de France in 1776.  Another lodge, the \"Indivisible\", in [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], was created by the Grand Lodge of Holland in 1778 and rejoined the Grand Orient de France (according to Ulysse Capitaine) in 1787.\n\n===The Grand Orient de Bouillon===\nThe [[Duchy of Bouillon]], annexed from the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge by French troops of Louis XIV, was a sovereign duchy set up for the Duc de Bouillon. Its dukes during the 18th century were Charles-Godefroy, then Godefroy-Charles de La Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne.  The La Tour d'Auvergne family in this era was strongly linked to the [[House of Stuart]], deposed from the English throne (the Duke was the brother-in-law of [[James III of England]]), as well as being enthusiastic freemasons.  This Grand Orient thus represented the \"[[Jacobitism|Jacobite]]\" tendency within Freemasonry (named after [[James II of England]]), a Freemasonry traditionally finding its roots among the Catholic Scottish nobility and in a format based on the upper degrees of freemasonry.  This Grand Orient was represented by one lodge, the \"Saint-Charles de la Parfaite Harmonie\", situated in Bouillon.  Its presence was historically confirmed in 1763, but few documents on it survive.  It was the origin for other lodges, such as \"Amiti\u00e9 et Fraternit\u00e9\" in 1786 in [[Dunkirk]]. Its influence was probably more important than the surviving documents seem to show.<ref>Andr\u00e9 de Kervella</ref>\n\n==1795 to 1814==\nThe French Revolution decimated freemasonry in France itself - from around 700 lodges and 30,000 masons during the [[ancien regime]], only around 30 lodges and a few thousand masons remained.<ref name=\"Chevalier\" /> - but led to a new start for Belgian freemasonry.  This was due to the new French republic's annexation of the Austrian Netherlands in 1794, and its merger into France from 1795 to 1814.  From 1798, thanks to French military lodges, the \"Les Amis Philanthrope\" lodge was created in Brussels, giving second wind to Belgian freemasonry and forming the basis for the most important Belgian Masonic works of the following century.  The military lodges also caused a massive expansion in the number of new lodges (see the list below).\n\nThe French period was characterised by an important expansion in Freemasonry in what would become Belgium.  These lodges were perhaps revolutionary, [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]] and Francophile.  They were above all, at least in appearances, strongly submitted to French imperial power - Napoleon, as emperor, favoured Freemasonry only because he controlled it.  It was at this time largely [[Deist]], if not Catholic, even if anti-clericalism was never really absent, and experience little tension with the Roman Catholic Church.  This period came to an end with Napoleon's final defeat at the [[battle of Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815, by which time Belgium had 27 lodges.\n\n==1815-1830==\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|treaty of Paris]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]] at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] annexed Belgium to the [[kingdom of the Netherlands]], with Belgian Freemasonry coming under Dutch instead of French influence.  Some of its lodges disappeared with the end of French control, some of which were revived later.  The Grand Lodge of the Netherlands (Grand Loge des Pays-Bas) formed at this time, with two administrative Grand Lodges (one for the north, known as Holland, and the other for the south, known as Belgium); the southern one included the \"Bonne amiti\u00e9\" lodge of Namur, which was number one on the southern administrative Grand Lodge's tablet.<ref>See G. de Froidcourt</ref> Prince Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric d'Orange-Nassau became the overall lodge's Serenest Grand Master and Prince Charles-Alexandre de Gavre, a member of the \"Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" lodge of Namur since the mid-1770s, became the southern lodge's official representative.  Nevertheless, few records survive on the relations between the two administrative lodges and between the Serenest Grand Master and the various lodges, especially those in Belgium.  These relations are illustrated by an episode in 1821 when the Belgian lodges suppressed the upper grades to replace them with a system of two contemporary grades to three top grades (\"\u00c9lu\" and \"Ma\u00eetre \u00c9lu\").\n\nIn effect, the [[Scottish Rite|Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]] was formalised in 33 grades in 1801 in Charlestown, to return to France in 1804.  This Rite also proved highly successful across Europe and the Americas.  It was in 1817 that a supreme council of this rite would be created in Belgium, on the initiative of the \"Les Amis Philantropes\" lodge.  In 1818 the Primitive Scottish Rite, also known as the Namur Rite, was officially constituted, with the Prince de Gavre as its Grand Master - its origins date back to the 1780s but it only ever had 4 lodges in Belgium and held its last ceremony there in 1866.<ref name=\"Clement\">(F. Clement)</ref>\n\nIt was not only the upper grades that were practised during this era - some lodges practiced the philosophical Scottish rite, others the rectified rite, the Misra\u00efm rite, the system of H\u00e9r\u00e9dom de Kilwinning, or even the system of two upper grades put in place by prince Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric d'Orange-Nassau, among others the \"le Septentrion\" lodge in Ghent.<ref>See de Schampeleire, 1973</ref>  Thus the diversity of practises in the late 18th century was carried over into the first half of the 19th century\n\n==The Grand Orient of Belgium==\n[[Image:Loge-parfaite-union-mons.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The \"La Parfaite Union\" lodge in [[Mons]], built to plans by the architect Hector Puchot in 1890]]\nThe period of Dutch influence came to an end with the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830.\n\n===Beginnings===\nThe birth of the [[kingdom of Belgium]] led in 1833 to the creation of the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]], supported by [[Leopold I of Belgium]], who had himself been initiated in the \"Loge l'Esp\u00e9rance\" at [[Berne]] in 1813.  It was proposed that he become its Serenest Grand Master, but he declined the offer and instead gave that post to baron [[Goswin de Stassart]], one of his closest collaborators.  Stassert had been initiated in Paris around 1803 and was affiliated to the \"Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" lodge of Namur on 1 May 1820, then to the \"Les Amis philanthropes\" lodge on 24 June 1835. Stassart took as his special representative [[Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen]].<ref>MR. Thielemans. Goswin, baron de Stassart (1780-1854). Politique et franc-ma\u00e7onnerie. \u00c9d. Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Belgique, 2008.</ref> \"La Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" took number one on the tablet of the Grand Orient of Belgium until 1898, when it ceded that position to the \"Parfaite Union\" lodge of Mons.  Some lodges remained faithful to the Grand-Orient des Pays-Bas -, the \"Septentrion\" in Ghent did so until 1883 and only joined the Grand Orient of Belgium late on.\n\nThe lodges in Li\u00e8ge, Huy and [[Verviers]] created the \"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration ma\u00e7onnique belge\" before joining the Grand Orient of Belgium in 1854.  The creation of a new Grand Lodge for the new country of Belgium had rapidly caused these lodges problems over article 135 in the Masonic statutes, which forbade political and religious discussions in lodges, and they made unsuccessful attempts to have its suppressed.  They then remained separate from the new Grand Lodge until the abrogation of this article in 1854.\n\nIn this era lodges were filled with military officers, so much so that F. Cl\u00e9ment protested \"\u2026, we demand if there are still any officers in the army who have not yet been initiated\"<ref>F Clement ''ibid'', p 108</ref>!\n\nIn the wake of the [[encyclical]] Mirari Vos of 1832 and the resultant episcopal letter from cardinal Englebert Sterckx and the episcopate in 1837 banning Catholics from being or becoming Freemasons, Belgian freemasonry became less Catholic in character, though it remained deist.  However, it seems that the Belgian episcopate favoured the election of Stassart as Grand Master, having initially decided that the struggle against \"Orangism\" (i.e. Protestantism) was the priority and that a freemasonry detached from Protestantism would be nominally neutral but in fact favour Catholicism.<ref>MR Thielemans</ref>\n\nThe struggle between the pro- and anti-clerical movements reached a crescendo.  It had a bearing on public education, up to the point that in 1834 the \"Les Amis Philanthropes\" lodge founded the [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles|Universit\u00e9 libre et la\u00efque de Bruxelles]], on the suggestion of [[Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen]] in his discourse of 24 June 1834 to that lodge.  The project then expanded massively, with several Catholic freemasons choosing freemasonry over the Catholic Church.  Little by little Freemasonry came to recruit its members from the anti-clerical milieux, but the struggle was rough, as seen most of all in the changes in the Grand Lodge.  For example, the old \"Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" lodge at Namur came to be held at arm's length by its \"ancients\", members of the Primitive Scottish Rite, and so did not disappear despite the importance of the disaffiliations and dissensions caused by the encyclical.<ref name=\"Clement\" />  Other lodges, however, did not have the same opportunity.\n\nThe [[Goswin de Stassart|Baron de Stassart]] retired as Grand Master of the Grand Orient (until then a post held for life) on 16 June 1841, following his departure as governor of the Province of Brabant for not having favoured the election of a \"Grand Mar\u00e9chal du Palais\" (he made a decision of the clerical type of the \"Unionist\" government) and facing the rise to power of socio-political movements within the lodge.  6,000 people gathered in the [[Parc de Bruxelles]] to show their solidarity with him, a considerable number for this era.\n\n===Political phase===\n<!---\n[[Eug\u00e8ne Defacqz]] va lui succ\u00e9der. Il va temporiser et essayer de ramener de la s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9 dans les travaux des loges. Il voulait \u00e9galement que la Grande Ma\u00eetrise soit une fonction r\u00e9\u00e9ligible tous les 3 ans. Cela ne se fera que beaucoup plus tard. En [[1850]], [[Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen]] d\u00e9pose sur la table du Grand Orient une proposition d'abrogation de l'article 135 des statuts du grand Orient, qui interdisait les discussions de religion et de politique lors des r\u00e9unions. La proposition de Verhaegen est mise \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude. En novembre [[1852]], Defacqz donne sa d\u00e9mission de la Grande Ma\u00eetrise. Il ne reviendra pas en arri\u00e8re, mais le Grand Orient la refuse. Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen fera office de Grand Ma\u00eetre jusqu'en [[1862]], date de sa mort. En [[1854]], il obtiendra l'abrogation de l'article 135. Cette abrogation va provoquer un \u00e9tat d'anarchie important dans la ma\u00e7onnerie belge, de nombreux ma\u00e7ons la quitteront, des loges se mettront en sommeil, d'autres se mettront sous l'autorit\u00e9 exclusive du Supr\u00eame Conseil de Belgique qui rompt ses relations avec le Grand Orient. C'est le cas pour les deux loges bruxelloises, les \"Vrais Amis de l'Union\" et les \"Amis du Progr\u00e8s\", qui vont fusionner \u00e0 cette occasion, formant ainsi la loge la plus nombreuse de Belgique. La phase politique du Grand Orient d\u00e9bute. Elle portera surtout sur les probl\u00e8mes de l'enseignement. La politisation de certaines loges devenait tellement importante que Verhaegen et le Grand Orient vont devoir faire partiellement marche arri\u00e8re. La loge de [[Verviers]], semble-t-il, la plus extr\u00e9miste, se verra signifier sa dissolution ! Il faudra attendre [[1880]], pour que le calme revienne, que le Supr\u00eame Conseil se rapproche et r\u00e9alise une nouvelle convention avec le Grand Orient de Belgique. Le rapprochement de la loge le Septentrion de Gand avec le Grand Orient, qui s'\u00e9tait op\u00e9r\u00e9 durant les ann\u00e9es \"politiques\", se mat\u00e9rialisera par son affiliation en [[1883]]. Il ne subsistait \u00e0 ce moment en Belgique plus que 16 loges occup\u00e9es par environ 2800 ma\u00e7ons ! En [[1891]], la phase politique du Grand Orient se terminait par un dernier acte politique, la demande officielle du suffrage universel pur et simple.\n\nJoseph Van Schoor, s\u00e9nateur et administrateur de la jeune [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]], membre des \"Amis Philanthropes\" va succ\u00e9der \u00e0 [[Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen]]. Il y mettra des conditions et notamment l'interdiction aux loges, s'il y avait discussion, de d\u00e9lib\u00e9rer sur la chose politique ou religieuse. Ce point sera, plus tard, clairement re-pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 par [[Charles Magnette]]. D'autre part, avec l'accord d'[[Eug\u00e8ne Defacqz]], il deviendra officiellement son successeur. Enfin, il ouvrira le chantier de la r\u00e9vision des statuts du [[Grand Orient de Belgique]]. Il \u00e9vitera ainsi la scission d\u00e9finitive du Grand Orient de Belgique avec le Supr\u00eame Conseil de Belgique. Notons que le [[Grand Orient de France]] avait connu une \u00e9volution similaire, la scission avec le [[Supr\u00eame Conseil de France]], ira, au contraire, en s'approfondissant, avec finalement la cr\u00e9ation de la [[Grande Loge de France]] en [[1894]]. Van Schoor mettra une derni\u00e8re condition \u00e0 sa Grande Ma\u00eetrise, c'est d'avoir \u00e0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9 Pierre Van Humbeek alors pr\u00e9sident de la loge des \"Vrais Amis de l'Union et du Progr\u00e8s R\u00e9unis\", qui sera ministre de l'instruction publique en [[1874]], et qui, d'ailleurs, lui succ\u00e9dera. Cela se fera de bien curieuse fa\u00e7on et montre l'\u00e9tat de d\u00e9sordre de la ma\u00e7onnerie belge \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Comme cette loge ne faisait plus partie du Grand Orient de Belgique, il fallut trouver une solution. Van Humbeek s'affiliera \u00e0 la loge namuroise, la \"Bonne Amiti\u00e9\", laquelle le d\u00e9signera comme d\u00e9put\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Grand Orient, ce qui permit \u00e0 Van Humbeek d'entrer dans la Grande Commission de celui-ci! Les n\u00e9gociations pouvaient commencer et l'ensemble des loges existantes \u00e0 ce moment vont finalement renouer avec l'ob\u00e9dience.<br/>\nNotons que si la suppression de l'obligation de l'invocation du [[Grand Architecte de l'Univers]] par le [[Grand Orient de France]] en [[1877]] a eu des cons\u00e9quences schismatiques importantes internes (voir [[Querelle du Grand Architecte de l'Univers]]) et dans les relations internationales de la [[franc-ma\u00e7onnerie]] fran\u00e7aise, la m\u00eame mesure prise quelques ann\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t ([[1872]]) par le [[Grand Orient de Belgique]] n'a occasionn\u00e9 pour la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie belge quasi aucun remous interne ou ext\u00e9rieur.\n--->\n\n===Appeasement===\n<!---\nEn [[1883]] d\u00e9bute la Grand Ma\u00eetrise du Comte [[Eug\u00e8ne Goblet d'Alviella]], homme politique et ancien pr\u00e9sident de la loge les \"Amis Philanthropes\" qui marque une nouvelle expansion de la Franc-ma\u00e7onnerie belge, son repositionnement large dans la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie internationale (il renouera avec les ob\u00e9diences notamment allemandes qui avaient rompu suite \u00e0 l'abrogation de l'article 135).

Le premier coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement pour jeunes filles fut cr\u00e9\u00e9 \u00e0 l'initiative des \"Vrai Amis de l'Union et du Progr\u00e8s R\u00e9unis\", et des \"Amis Philanthropes\" \u00e0 Bruxelles en [[1864]], l'Institut qui s'appelle aujourd'hui Gatti de Gamond. \u00c0 Anvers, la loge \"les Amis du Commerce et de la Pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance R\u00e9unis\" va \u00e9galement se pencher sur l'am\u00e9lioration de l'\u00e9ducation des femmes.\n\nPr\u00e9sid\u00e9 par le prix Nobel de la paix, [[Henri La Fontaine|Henri Lafontaine]], membre de la loge les \"Amis Philanthropes\" et professeur \u00e0 l'[[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]] (l'Universit\u00e9 nouvelle), la Ligue belge des Droits des femmes invite Maria Deraismes \u00e0 Bruxelles.

Bruwier et ML Pirotte</ref>\n\nLe mouvement flamand et la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie belge. On ne peut pas dire que la p\u00e9riode hollandaise de la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie ([[1814]]-[[1830]]) verra une \"n\u00e9\u00e9rlandisation\" des loges situ\u00e9es en Flandre. La Grande loge d'administration m\u00e9ridionale \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e tr\u00e8s francophone et calqu\u00e9e sur ce qui existait au temps de l'Empire fran\u00e7ais. Il y avait cependant quelques travaux en Flamand. La loge le \"Septentrion\" de [[Gand]], m\u00eame si le flamand n'en \u00e9tait certainement pas exclus \u00e0 priori, n'a pas jou\u00e9, apparemment, un r\u00f4le majeur dans les mouvements flamands la\u00efcs. En effet, ceux-ci vont r\u00e9ellement \u00e9merger lors de la phase politique du [[Grand Orient de Belgique]]. Il s'agissait de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'emprise de l'[[\u00c9glise catholique romaine|\u00c9glise]] en [[Flandre]] sur les masses populaires. Cependant dans la partie flamande du pays, les franc-ma\u00e7ons se concentraient surtout dans les m\u00e9tropoles, Gand et Anvers, et la francisation progressive de la bourgeoise flamande \u00e9tait un fait r\u00e9el au cours du {{s-|XIX|e}}. Cette double caract\u00e9ristique va structurer le mouvement la\u00efc dans le nord du pays: il sera flamand et progressiste. D\u00e8s les ann\u00e9es [[1865]], c'est \u00e0 Anvers que le mouvement se structurera le plus autour du Willemsfonds et de la loge \"les Amis du Commerce et de la Pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance R\u00e9unis\". En [[1876]], la loge \"les Amis de Themis\" \u00e0 Anvers fut la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 travailler en flamand. En 1890, une scission de cette loge verra la cr\u00e9ation de la premi\u00e8re loge enti\u00e8rement flamande : \"Marnix de Sint-Aldegonde\".  Leurs actions, et on le comprend ais\u00e9ment, se concentraient principalement sur l'enseignement. Ils port\u00e8rent la \"question flamande\" sur la table du Grand Orient en 1874. Le Grand Orient adopta officiellement leur position politique en [[1875]], \u00e0 savoir la n\u00e9\u00e9rlandisation de l'enseignement de base en Flandre. Et en [[1883]], la nouvelle loi sur l'enseignement, vot\u00e9 par le parti lib\u00e9ral encore au pouvoir pour un an et tr\u00e8s proche \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque de la Franc-ma\u00e7onnerie, int\u00e9grera partiellement leur revendication.<ref>Els Witte</ref>\n--->\n\n== 20th century ==\nThe main defining feature of 20th century freemasonry was the creation of several female lodges, of mixed obediences.  The second half of the century was also characterised by the structuralisation of international freemasonry into two blocks.\n\n===To 1914===\nIn 1900, [[Eug\u00e8ne Goblet d'Alviella|Goblet d'Alviella]] became president of the Supreme Council (Upper Degrees of the [[Scottish Rite|Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]]), after having been president of the Grand Orient of Belgium.  He had an important international impact, organising the international conference of Supreme Councils in Brussels in 1907, at which 21/25 Supreme Councils were represented, including those from the United States of America but with the notable exceptions of the 3 \"Supreme Councils\" of Great Britain. This conference was repeated in Washington in 1912 and in Lausanne in 1922. In 1913, the Supreme Council of Belgium delivered the patents of constitutions from the Supreme Council of the Netherlands.  It was at this moment that Freemasonry first took on a new international unity.<ref>Clement (ter)</ref>\n\nWithout denying its past, at the start of the 20th century Belgian Freemasonry and its practices were now more classical in appearance, in an appeased spirit and very different to its appearance a hundred years before - obedience to the symbolic degrees (the first three degrees), to the Upper Degrees, often directed by the same man - in short, a Freemasonry that was expanding.  Nevertheless, from this communal base, Belgian Freemasonry little by little became more diverse.  A large part of Belgian Freemasonry as it stands today derives from this Grand Orient - Supr\u00eame Conseil unity at the start of the 20th century.  The lay Flemish struggle, emanating from the [[Antwerp]] and [[Ghent]] lodges, at this point concentrated on the Flemishisation of the [[University of Ghent]].\n\n===Women===\n{{See also|Women and Freemasonry}}\nThe main development in early 20th century Belgian Freemasonry, however, was the birth of mixed female-male Freemasonry and women's assertion of their equal right with men to become masons.  The first female Belgian Freemason was [[Isabelle Gatti de Gamond]], initiated in the \"Diderot\" lodge of the Grand Symbolic Scottish Rite Lodge (French in origin) around 1903.  She was later invited to a Masonic meeting at the \"Amis philanthropes\" lodge, but she fell sick (dying in 1905) and this meeting did not occur.  In 1905 the first lodge of [[Le Droit Humain]] was created in [[Amsterdam]], the Cazotte lodge (number 13), inaugurated by [[Georges Martin (Freemason)|Georges Martin]]: a delegation from the \"Amis du Commerce et de la Pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance R\u00e9unis\" and \"Amis Philanthropes\" lodges was sent to it and these two lodges decided to affiliate to it, with the idea of creating a lodge of this jurisdiction in Belgium.  Concerning the presence of women in a lodge, the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]] pronounced the recreation of [[rite of adoption|lodges of adoption]] in the image of those of 18th century French lodges of that type!  These lodges of adoption formed the basis for the creation of the  [[Grande Loge f\u00e9minine de France]] after the [[Second World War]].\n\nOn 21 November 1910, the \"les Amis Philanthropes\" lodge, under the presidency of [[Henri La Fontaine|Henri Lafontaine]], welcomed the founder of [[Le Droit Humain]] along with [[Maria Deraismes]], Georges Martin and other male and female Freemasons to a conference.  The Grand Orient quietly condemned the move, and the \"Les Amis Philanthropes\" lodge split, speeding up the formation of the first [[Le Droit Humain]] lodge in Belgium out of the pro-female masons who had split from \"Les Amis Philanthropes\".  This was to be the \"\u00c9galit\u00e9\" (\"Equality\") lodge, number 45, which was officially inaugurated in 1912.  Unfortunately the death of [[Isabelle Gatti de Gamond]] meant the new lodge had no high-profile woman to recruit for it and so was mainly made up of men.  Only in the inter-war period did women take up leadership responsibilities in this jurisdiction in Belgium, which became autonomous in 1928 with (at first) 6 lodges.<ref>See M Bruwier and ML Pirotte</ref>  This autonomy came with the 1928 formation of the [[Belgian Federation of Le Droit Humain|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration belge du Droit Humain]] as a mixed-sex Grand Lodge, and saw a continuing expansion (whilst the Grand Orient of Belgium seeing its numbers neither rise nor fall during the inter-war period and remaining hostile to the Droit Humain until after the Second World War).  The [[Grande Loge f\u00e9minine de France]] was created in 1952, with a solely female membership.  This jurisdiction later created lodges in other countries, with Belgium' first forming in 1974.  The [[Freemasonry in Belgium#Women's Grand Lodge of Belgium|Women's Grand Lodge Of Belgium]] formed in 1981.\n\n===1914-1945===\nDuring the First World War Belgium was almost wholly occupied by Germany and the lodges suspended their operations.  The period was marked by the \"Call to the Grand Lodges of Germany\" organised by [[Charles Magnette]], Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Belgium, on 27 September 1914, aiming to have the occupying troops exactions on the Belgians examined by an independent commission.  This received two polite responses from seven close jurisdictions.  Magnette relapsed on 7 November 1915 to prevent the massive deportation of Belgian workers to Germany and was arrested and imprisoned by the occupying authorities for subversion for the duration.<ref>GOB</ref>  The lodges resumed their work when peace came, but found new enemies in the dictators of the right and left (with the former finding Masonry's emphasis on free thought dangerous, and the latter reproaching it for \"class collaboration\").\n\nIn 1921 the \"Association Ma\u00e7onnique Internationale\" (A.M.I.) was created on the initiative of the Swiss Grand Lodge Alpina and with the active participation of [[Charles Magnette]].  Like the vast majority of international Freemasonry (with the notable exception of the Grand United Lodge of England), the Grand Orient of Belgium adhered to this organisation, though the Grand Lodges of New York and the Netherlands soon left it.\n\nOn the German invasion on 10 May 1940, Freemasonry was banned.  With the aid of a list of Freemasons published in a conservative Catholic newspaper,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} the occupiers arrested, deported and assassinated several Masons, such as Georges P\u00eatre, president of the supreme council in 1942, and [[Jules Hiernaux]], Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Belgium in 1944.  Belgian Masonic life continued in exile in London and New York, and even secretly in the concentration camp at [[Esterwegen]] (the \"[[Libert\u00e9 ch\u00e9rie]]\" lodge) and the PoW camp at [[Prenslau]] (the \"[[L'Obstin\u00e9e]]\" lodge).\n\n===Post-war===\nOn Belgium's liberation, Masonry resumed but its numbers had fallen by a quarter.  In 1950, the \"Association Ma\u00e7onnique Internationale\" was dissolved by the [[Grande Loge suisse Alpina]] which had created it.  On 15 May 1954 the Convention of Luxembourg was signed, combining the United Grand Lodges of Germany, the Grand Orient of the Netherlands, the [[Grande loge suisse Alpina]], etc.  This convention enumerated the six proofs of regularity to which jurisdictions had to subscribe in order to be mutually recognised.  The United Grand Lodge of England later joined this movement, becoming the regulator of Masonic regularity. The schism between [[Regular Masonic jurisdictions|\"regular\"]] and \"liberal\" Freemasonry became official at this date, even if in 1958 the Grand Orient of the Netherlands unsuccessfully tried to reconcile the Grands Orient de France and Grand Orient of Belgium to the international movement which it was creating.  In 1959 5 lodges aspiring to greater \"regularity\" formed the \"[[Freemasonry in Belgium#Grand Lodge of Belgium|Grand Lodge of Belgium]]\", dragging in their wake Belgium's Supreme Council, which broke off relations with the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]] in 1960.  The Grand Lodge of Belgium was recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England in 1965.  On 22 January 1961, in reaction, the [[CLIPSAS]] was created to gather together the \"liberal\" jurisdictions (most important among them the Grand Orient of Belgium, the Grand Orient de France and the Droit Humain).  This grouping ran into difficulties in 1995, leading to the creation of \"AMIL\".\n\nIn 1979, a schism occurred in the [[Freemasonry in Belgium#Grand Lodge of Belgium|Grand Lodge of Belgium]] with the creation of the [[Freemasonry in Belgium#Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium|Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium]], dragging along a so-called \"Grand et Supr\u00eame Conseil de Belgique\" via a schism in the Supreme Council of Belgium.  This new Grand Lodge finally became the only one in Belgium to be recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England.  This led to a rapprochement between the [[Freemasonry in Belgium#Grand Lodge of Belgium|Grand Lodge of Belgium]] and the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]], with accords of mutual recognition and cooperation officialised in 1989.\n\nNew Upper Degrees jurisdictions were also created: the \"[[Scottish Rite of 1962|Grand Coll\u00e8ge du Rite \u00c9cossais pour la Belgique]]\" (originally recruiting only from the Grand Orient of Belgium), the remains of the \"Supreme Council ''of'' Belgium\" (originally recruiting only from the Gand Lodge) and the \"Supreme Council ''for'' Belgium\" (originally recruiting from both). Later both these all-male \"Supreme Councils\" were merged. Even Belgium's male-female [[Belgian Federation of Le Droit Humain|Droit Humain]] and the [[Freemasonry in Belgium#Women's Grand Lodge of Belgium|Grande Loge F\u00e9minine]] have their own systems of Upper Degrees.\n\nOther jurisdictions and rites were also present in Belgian, but in a quite secretive manner.  Among them, the most important rite was the [[Rite of Memphis-Misraim]], long present in Belgium and now co-operating with most of the \"liberal\" Belgian masonic associations.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century, Belgian freemasonry thus had a very diversified appearance and a great wealth of practices, with a number of female and male freemasons that it has not reached since its origins.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*R Desmed.

The source of this fragmentation was to be found particularly in the complexity of its institutions, the influence of the government or surrounding powers, and its very deeply rooted local sense of identity.\n\nThe first Belgian lodge was founded in 1721 in [[Mons]], under the name \"La Parfaite Union\" (\"The Perfect Union\").  It has frequently changed its name and allegiance since then, but still exists today as number 1 of the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]].  Other, more short-lived lodges seem to have been created in [[Ghent]] and [[Tournai]] in 1730.  The first evidence of masonic activity in the provinces dates to 1743, in [[Brussels]].<ref>See De Schampheleire</ref>  This would be the \"La Discr\u00e8te Imp\u00e9riale\" (\"The Discrete Imperial\") lodge of [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] which would have number one on the tablet of the order of the Provincial Grand Lodge (Grande loge provinciale) of the Austrian Netherlands, the mother-lodge of London several times recognising it as the oldest in the region.  It disappeared with the Provincial Grand Lodge of the Austrian Netherlands.<ref>See of the AusB. Vander Schelden</ref>\n\nThanks to the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], from 1746 several lodges formed under the influence of French forces occupying the country and of the Grand Lodge of France (of which a French [[prince de sang]], [[Louis de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9 (1709-1771)|Louis de Bourbon Cond\u00e9, Comte de Clermont]], was Grand Master).  These lodges received their patents from the Grand Lodge of France, the Grand Lodge of London, the Grand Lodge of Holland or the Grand Lodge of Scotland - for example, the \"Parfaite Union\" (\"Perfect Union\") Lodge at [[Namur (city)|Namur]], one of the \"ancient\" lodges, which in 1777 became the \"Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" (\"Good Friendship\") lodge in Namur).  After the Treaty of la Barri\u00e8re in 1715, Batavian troops (also including English and Scottish troops) occupied the strongholds of the Austrian Netherlands (notably Namur, [[Tournai]], [[Veurne]], [[Ypres]], [[Warneton, Belgium|Warneton]]) for a long and difficult period, and it was probably this that led to the creation or confirmation of more lasting lodges.\n\nAnother event, within freemasonry itself, accelerated the demand for patents from the non-French masonic authorities.  Internal disputes within the Grand Lodge of France led to its suspension in 1767, a result of the Convent's secession from this Grand Lodge in Paris, having been excluded in previous years.<ref>See P. Chevalier</ref>  From then on lodges in the Austrian Netherlands came to feel isolated.  This was certainly the case for the \"Vraie et Parfaite Harmonie\" (\"True and Perfect Harmony\") lodge in Mons (English patent, received January 1770), probably also for the \"Discr\u00e8te Imp\u00e9riale\" in [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] (English patent, received June 1765) and perhaps for the  \"Parfaite Union/Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" in Namur (Scottish patent, received February 1770).  In 1770, the Provincial Grand Lodge of the Austrian Netherlands formed, dependent on the Grand Lodge of London (the \"Moderns\"), made up of 26 lodges and with the Marquis de Gage as its Grand Master.  It was centred on de Gage's own lodge \"la Vraie et Parfaite Harmonie\" in Mons, the most brilliant of the 18th century Austrian Netherlands.\n\nIt was in Brussels that Belgian Freemasonry was particularly important, with Masons frequently coming from its noble families.  Also the ULB (Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles) was also founded by several Masons, many of whom were also Catholics, following an appeal by the Lodges of Belgium.<ref>{{Request quotation|date=March 2009}} Itin\u00e9raire de la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie \u00e0 Bruxelles, Bruxelles, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 royale belge de G\u00e9ographie / Parcours ma\u00e7onnique, 2000 - (collection, Hommes et paysages ; 31)</ref>  To quote the writer Liane Ranieri<ref>Histoire de Bruxelles, Toulouse, Privat, 1976, p.352</ref>\"Originating from Brussels' Masonic lodges, Brussels' University largely benefitted from the communal [Masonic] authorities; [there were] 25 Masons out of its 31 administrators\".  An imperial edict of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] of January 1786 reduced the number of lodges in Brussels to 3 and banned them in all the other towns and cities.  The Marquis de Gage tried to stall the edict but to no avail, and on 26 June that same year he was dismissed.  Of the 3 official lodges in Brussels, only one truly continued the struggle.\n\nIt is useful to underline that the majority of 18th century lodges belonged to one man who became his lodge's President and so usually died out when he or his descendants died out.<ref name=\"Chevalier\">P. Chevalier</ref>  Examples of this include the \"Parfaite Union\" (Fonson family), \"Vraie et Parfaite harmonie\" (Marquis de Gage) and \"Union des c\u0153urs\" (\"Union of Hearts\", by the chevalier de Sicard) lodges. Others, like the \"Parfaite Union/Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" of Namur, did not have this characteristic and had presidents who succeeded each other quite regularly.  This was why Joseph II's edict more surely put to sleep the majority of lodges of this era.\n\nNevertheless, a number of lodges continued to operate in secret.  These were helped by the [[United States of Belgium|Brabant Revolution]], whose beginnings can be seen as early as 1787 and which broke out in earnest in 1789 in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].  As a result, there arose one lodge in Tournai, two in Mons, one in Namur, one in [[Antwerp]] and one in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]].\n\n====18th century lodges in Brussels====\n*One lodge, name unknown, c.1740.\n*L\u2019Union, 1742.\n*L\u2019Equit\u00e9, 1743.\n*L\u2019Union Parfaite, 1754.\n*Loge Saint-Charles.\n*La Constance de l\u2019Union, 1769.\n*La Constance Eprouv\u00e9e (20 mai 1770)\n*L\u2019Heureuse Rencontre, 1772.\n*La Parfaite Amiti\u00e9 (ou l\u2019Amiti\u00e9), 1772.\n*Les Vrais Amis de la Justice, 1775.\n*Les Vrais Amis de l\u2019Union, 1782.\n*L\u2019Union Fraternelle, 1784.\n*La Constance de l\u2019Union (or les Amis de l\u2019Union), 1784.\n\n=====[[Rite of adoption|Lodges of adoption]] (women)=====\n*La Parfaite Harmonie, 1782.\n*A l\u2019Heureuse Rencontre (Les Vrais Amis)\n*Au Chapitre de l\u2019Union, 1777.\n*Aux Vrais Amis de l\u2019Union.\n*Grande Loge de Saint-Andr\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9cosse, 1785.\n\n=====Secret Lodge=====\n*Au Pot d\u2019Etain, Grand Place.\n\n===Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge===\nThe lodges in the principality of [[Li\u00e8ge]], not submitted to the imperial edict of 1786, continued in a more classical manner.\n\nIn the principality of Li\u00e8ge, the first lodge seems to have been \"La Nymphe\" (\"The Nymph\") lodge of [[Chaudfontaine]] in 1749.  In 1760, the prince-bishop banned freemasonry, but his successor Fran\u00e7ois-Charles de Velbr\u00fcck (1772\u20131784) belonged to and protected the Order (during the 18th century, several Catholic priests were also Freemasons.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}})\n\nIn 1774 the \"Union des C\u0153urs\" lodge was founded in Li\u00e8ge by chevalier Pierre de Sicard, who had already founded several lodges from which he profited (according to U. Capitaine) - in the lodge's regulations, the cost of a mallet, an apron, a lodge rug and other Masonic equipment was precisely stipulated!  This was not the first time that the mercantile instinct had intruded into Freemasonry, with France's Grand Lodge also struggling against it at this time.  This was why, Ulysse Capitaine tells us, there was a huge transfer of \"brothers\" from this lodge to the \"la Parfaite Intelligence\" (\"The Perfect Intelligence\") lodge, created in 1775 by the [[Grand Orient de France]].  A schism quickly took place in this lodge, with the creation of the \"la Parfaite Egalit\u00e9\" (\"The Perfect Equality\") lodge, finally recognised by the Grand Orient de France in 1776.  Another lodge, the \"Indivisible\", in [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], was created by the Grand Lodge of Holland in 1778 and rejoined the Grand Orient de France (according to Ulysse Capitaine) in 1787.\n\n===The Grand Orient de Bouillon===\nThe [[Duchy of Bouillon]], annexed from the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge by French troops of Louis XIV, was a sovereign duchy set up for the Duc de Bouillon. Its dukes during the 18th century were Charles-Godefroy, then Godefroy-Charles de La Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne.  The La Tour d'Auvergne family in this era was strongly linked to the [[House of Stuart]], deposed from the English throne (the Duke was the brother-in-law of [[James III of England]]), as well as being enthusiastic freemasons.  This Grand Orient thus represented the \"[[Jacobitism|Jacobite]]\" tendency within Freemasonry (named after [[James II of England]]), a Freemasonry traditionally finding its roots among the Catholic Scottish nobility and in a format based on the upper degrees of freemasonry.  This Grand Orient was represented by one lodge, the \"Saint-Charles de la Parfaite Harmonie\", situated in Bouillon.  Its presence was historically confirmed in 1763, but few documents on it survive.  It was the origin for other lodges, such as \"Amiti\u00e9 et Fraternit\u00e9\" in 1786 in [[Dunkirk]]. Its influence was probably more important than the surviving documents seem to show.<ref>Andr\u00e9 de Kervella</ref>\n\n==1795 to 1814==\nThe French Revolution decimated freemasonry in France itself - from around 700 lodges and 30,000 masons during the [[ancien regime]], only around 30 lodges and a few thousand masons remained.<ref name=\"Chevalier\" /> - but led to a new start for Belgian freemasonry.  This was due to the new French republic's annexation of the Austrian Netherlands in 1794, and its merger into France from 1795 to 1814.  From 1798, thanks to French military lodges, the \"Les Amis Philanthrope\" lodge was created in Brussels, giving second wind to Belgian freemasonry and forming the basis for the most important Belgian Masonic works of the following century.  The military lodges also caused a massive expansion in the number of new lodges (see the list below).\n\nThe French period was characterised by an important expansion in Freemasonry in what would become Belgium.  These lodges were perhaps revolutionary, [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]] and Francophile.  They were above all, at least in appearances, strongly submitted to French imperial power - Napoleon, as emperor, favoured Freemasonry only because he controlled it.  It was at this time largely [[Deist]], if not Catholic, even if anti-clericalism was never really absent, and experience little tension with the Roman Catholic Church.  This period came to an end with Napoleon's final defeat at the [[battle of Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815, by which time Belgium had 27 lodges.\n\n==1815-1830==\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|treaty of Paris]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]] at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] annexed Belgium to the [[kingdom of the Netherlands]], with Belgian Freemasonry coming under Dutch instead of French influence.  Some of its lodges disappeared with the end of French control, some of which were revived later.  The Grand Lodge of the Netherlands (Grand Loge des Pays-Bas) formed at this time, with two administrative Grand Lodges (one for the north, known as Holland, and the other for the south, known as Belgium); the southern one included the \"Bonne amiti\u00e9\" lodge of Namur, which was number one on the southern administrative Grand Lodge's tablet.<ref>See G. de Froidcourt</ref> Prince Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric d'Orange-Nassau became the overall lodge's Serenest Grand Master and Prince Charles-Alexandre de Gavre, a member of the \"Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" lodge of Namur since the mid-1770s, became the southern lodge's official representative.  Nevertheless, few records survive on the relations between the two administrative lodges and between the Serenest Grand Master and the various lodges, especially those in Belgium.  These relations are illustrated by an episode in 1821 when the Belgian lodges suppressed the upper grades to replace them with a system of two contemporary grades to three top grades (\"\u00c9lu\" and \"Ma\u00eetre \u00c9lu\").\n\nIn effect, the [[Scottish Rite|Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]] was formalised in 33 grades in 1801 in Charlestown, to return to France in 1804.  This Rite also proved highly successful across Europe and the Americas.  It was in 1817 that a supreme council of this rite would be created in Belgium, on the initiative of the \"Les Amis Philantropes\" lodge.  In 1818 the Primitive Scottish Rite, also known as the Namur Rite, was officially constituted, with the Prince de Gavre as its Grand Master - its origins date back to the 1780s but it only ever had 4 lodges in Belgium and held its last ceremony there in 1866.<ref name=\"Clement\">(F. Clement)</ref>\n\nIt was not only the upper grades that were practised during this era - some lodges practiced the philosophical Scottish rite, others the rectified rite, the Misra\u00efm rite, the system of H\u00e9r\u00e9dom de Kilwinning, or even the system of two upper grades put in place by prince Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric d'Orange-Nassau, among others the \"le Septentrion\" lodge in Ghent.<ref>See de Schampeleire, 1973</ref>  Thus the diversity of practises in the late 18th century was carried over into the first half of the 19th century\n\n==The Grand Orient of Belgium==\n[[Image:Loge-parfaite-union-mons.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The \"La Parfaite Union\" lodge in [[Mons]], built to plans by the architect Hector Puchot in 1890]]\nThe period of Dutch influence came to an end with the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830.\n\n===Beginnings===\nThe birth of the [[kingdom of Belgium]] led in 1833 to the creation of the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]], supported by [[Leopold I of Belgium]], who had himself been initiated in the \"Loge l'Esp\u00e9rance\" at [[Berne]] in 1813.  It was proposed that he become its Serenest Grand Master, but he declined the offer and instead gave that post to baron [[Goswin de Stassart]], one of his closest collaborators.  Stassert had been initiated in Paris around 1803 and was affiliated to the \"Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" lodge of Namur on 1 May 1820, then to the \"Les Amis philanthropes\" lodge on 24 June 1835. Stassart took as his special representative [[Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen]].<ref>MR. Thielemans. Goswin, baron de Stassart (1780-1854). Politique et franc-ma\u00e7onnerie. \u00c9d. Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Belgique, 2008.</ref> \"La Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" took number one on the tablet of the Grand Orient of Belgium until 1898, when it ceded that position to the \"Parfaite Union\" lodge of Mons.  Some lodges remained faithful to the Grand-Orient des Pays-Bas -, the \"Septentrion\" in Ghent did so until 1883 and only joined the Grand Orient of Belgium late on.\n\nThe lodges in Li\u00e8ge, Huy and [[Verviers]] created the \"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration ma\u00e7onnique belge\" before joining the Grand Orient of Belgium in 1854.  The creation of a new Grand Lodge for the new country of Belgium had rapidly caused these lodges problems over article 135 in the Masonic statutes, which forbade political and religious discussions in lodges, and they made unsuccessful attempts to have its suppressed.  They then remained separate from the new Grand Lodge until the abrogation of this article in 1854.\n\nIn this era lodges were filled with military officers, so much so that F. Cl\u00e9ment protested \"\u2026, we demand if there are still any officers in the army who have not yet been initiated\"<ref>F Clement ''ibid'', p 108</ref>!\n\nIn the wake of the [[encyclical]] Mirari Vos of 1832 and the resultant episcopal letter from cardinal Englebert Sterckx and the episcopate in 1837 banning Catholics from being or becoming Freemasons, Belgian freemasonry became less Catholic in character, though it remained deist.  However, it seems that the Belgian episcopate favoured the election of Stassart as Grand Master, having initially decided that the struggle against \"Orangism\" (i.e. Protestantism) was the priority and that a freemasonry detached from Protestantism would be nominally neutral but in fact favour Catholicism.<ref>MR Thielemans</ref>\n\nThe struggle between the pro- and anti-clerical movements reached a crescendo.  It had a bearing on public education, up to the point that in 1834 the \"Les Amis Philanthropes\" lodge founded the [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles|Universit\u00e9 libre et la\u00efque de Bruxelles]], on the suggestion of [[Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen]] in his discourse of 24 June 1834 to that lodge.  The project then expanded massively, with several Catholic freemasons choosing freemasonry over the Catholic Church.  Little by little Freemasonry came to recruit its members from the anti-clerical milieux, but the struggle was rough, as seen most of all in the changes in the Grand Lodge.  For example, the old \"Bonne Amiti\u00e9\" lodge at Namur came to be held at arm's length by its \"ancients\", members of the Primitive Scottish Rite, and so did not disappear despite the importance of the disaffiliations and dissensions caused by the encyclical.<ref name=\"Clement\" />  Other lodges, however, did not have the same opportunity.\n\nThe [[Goswin de Stassart|Baron de Stassart]] retired as Grand Master of the Grand Orient (until then a post held for life) on 16 June 1841, following his departure as governor of the Province of Brabant for not having favoured the election of a \"Grand Mar\u00e9chal du Palais\" (he made a decision of the clerical type of the \"Unionist\" government) and facing the rise to power of socio-political movements within the lodge.  6,000 people gathered in the [[Parc de Bruxelles]] to show their solidarity with him, a considerable number for this era.\n\n===Political phase===\n<!---\n[[Eug\u00e8ne Defacqz]] va lui succ\u00e9der. Il va temporiser et essayer de ramener de la s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9 dans les travaux des loges. Il voulait \u00e9galement que la Grande Ma\u00eetrise soit une fonction r\u00e9\u00e9ligible tous les 3 ans. Cela ne se fera que beaucoup plus tard. En [[1850]], [[Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen]] d\u00e9pose sur la table du Grand Orient une proposition d'abrogation de l'article 135 des statuts du grand Orient, qui interdisait les discussions de religion et de politique lors des r\u00e9unions. La proposition de Verhaegen est mise \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude. En novembre [[1852]], Defacqz donne sa d\u00e9mission de la Grande Ma\u00eetrise. Il ne reviendra pas en arri\u00e8re, mais le Grand Orient la refuse. Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen fera office de Grand Ma\u00eetre jusqu'en [[1862]], date de sa mort. En [[1854]], il obtiendra l'abrogation de l'article 135. Cette abrogation va provoquer un \u00e9tat d'anarchie important dans la ma\u00e7onnerie belge, de nombreux ma\u00e7ons la quitteront, des loges se mettront en sommeil, d'autres se mettront sous l'autorit\u00e9 exclusive du Supr\u00eame Conseil de Belgique qui rompt ses relations avec le Grand Orient. C'est le cas pour les deux loges bruxelloises, les \"Vrais Amis de l'Union\" et les \"Amis du Progr\u00e8s\", qui vont fusionner \u00e0 cette occasion, formant ainsi la loge la plus nombreuse de Belgique. La phase politique du Grand Orient d\u00e9bute. Elle portera surtout sur les probl\u00e8mes de l'enseignement. La politisation de certaines loges devenait tellement importante que Verhaegen et le Grand Orient vont devoir faire partiellement marche arri\u00e8re. La loge de [[Verviers]], semble-t-il, la plus extr\u00e9miste, se verra signifier sa dissolution ! Il faudra attendre [[1880]], pour que le calme revienne, que le Supr\u00eame Conseil se rapproche et r\u00e9alise une nouvelle convention avec le Grand Orient de Belgique. Le rapprochement de la loge le Septentrion de Gand avec le Grand Orient, qui s'\u00e9tait op\u00e9r\u00e9 durant les ann\u00e9es \"politiques\", se mat\u00e9rialisera par son affiliation en [[1883]]. Il ne subsistait \u00e0 ce moment en Belgique plus que 16 loges occup\u00e9es par environ 2800 ma\u00e7ons ! En [[1891]], la phase politique du Grand Orient se terminait par un dernier acte politique, la demande officielle du suffrage universel pur et simple.\n\nJoseph Van Schoor, s\u00e9nateur et administrateur de la jeune [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]], membre des \"Amis Philanthropes\" va succ\u00e9der \u00e0 [[Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen]]. Il y mettra des conditions et notamment l'interdiction aux loges, s'il y avait discussion, de d\u00e9lib\u00e9rer sur la chose politique ou religieuse. Ce point sera, plus tard, clairement re-pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 par [[Charles Magnette]]. D'autre part, avec l'accord d'[[Eug\u00e8ne Defacqz]], il deviendra officiellement son successeur. Enfin, il ouvrira le chantier de la r\u00e9vision des statuts du [[Grand Orient de Belgique]]. Il \u00e9vitera ainsi la scission d\u00e9finitive du Grand Orient de Belgique avec le Supr\u00eame Conseil de Belgique. Notons que le [[Grand Orient de France]] avait connu une \u00e9volution similaire, la scission avec le [[Supr\u00eame Conseil de France]], ira, au contraire, en s'approfondissant, avec finalement la cr\u00e9ation de la [[Grande Loge de France]] en [[1894]]. Van Schoor mettra une derni\u00e8re condition \u00e0 sa Grande Ma\u00eetrise, c'est d'avoir \u00e0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9 Pierre Van Humbeek alors pr\u00e9sident de la loge des \"Vrais Amis de l'Union et du Progr\u00e8s R\u00e9unis\", qui sera ministre de l'instruction publique en [[1874]], et qui, d'ailleurs, lui succ\u00e9dera. Cela se fera de bien curieuse fa\u00e7on et montre l'\u00e9tat de d\u00e9sordre de la ma\u00e7onnerie belge \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Comme cette loge ne faisait plus partie du Grand Orient de Belgique, il fallut trouver une solution. Van Humbeek s'affiliera \u00e0 la loge namuroise, la \"Bonne Amiti\u00e9\", laquelle le d\u00e9signera comme d\u00e9put\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Grand Orient, ce qui permit \u00e0 Van Humbeek d'entrer dans la Grande Commission de celui-ci! Les n\u00e9gociations pouvaient commencer et l'ensemble des loges existantes \u00e0 ce moment vont finalement renouer avec l'ob\u00e9dience.<br/>\nNotons que si la suppression de l'obligation de l'invocation du [[Grand Architecte de l'Univers]] par le [[Grand Orient de France]] en [[1877]] a eu des cons\u00e9quences schismatiques importantes internes (voir [[Querelle du Grand Architecte de l'Univers]]) et dans les relations internationales de la [[franc-ma\u00e7onnerie]] fran\u00e7aise, la m\u00eame mesure prise quelques ann\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t ([[1872]]) par le [[Grand Orient de Belgique]] n'a occasionn\u00e9 pour la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie belge quasi aucun remous interne ou ext\u00e9rieur.\n--->\n\n===Appeasement===\n<!---\nEn [[1883]] d\u00e9bute la Grand Ma\u00eetrise du Comte [[Eug\u00e8ne Goblet d'Alviella]], homme politique et ancien pr\u00e9sident de la loge les \"Amis Philanthropes\" qui marque une nouvelle expansion de la Franc-ma\u00e7onnerie belge, son repositionnement large dans la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie internationale (il renouera avec les ob\u00e9diences notamment allemandes qui avaient rompu suite \u00e0 l'abrogation de l'article 135).

Il y eut par ailleurs des femmes invit\u00e9es aux r\u00e9unions ma\u00e7onniques de cette \u00e9poque.\n\nC'est en [[1882]] que [[Maria Deraismes]] fut initi\u00e9e dans la loge fran\u00e7aise \"Les Libres Penseurs\" de [[Le Pecq|Pecq]] de la \"Grande Loge Symbolique \u00c9cossaise\" (scission du Supr\u00eame Conseil de France).

Le premier coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement pour jeunes filles fut cr\u00e9\u00e9 \u00e0 l'initiative des \"Vrai Amis de l'Union et du Progr\u00e8s R\u00e9unis\", et des \"Amis Philanthropes\" \u00e0 Bruxelles en [[1864]], l'Institut qui s'appelle aujourd'hui Gatti de Gamond. \u00c0 Anvers, la loge \"les Amis du Commerce et de la Pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance R\u00e9unis\" va \u00e9galement se pencher sur l'am\u00e9lioration de l'\u00e9ducation des femmes.\n\nPr\u00e9sid\u00e9 par le prix Nobel de la paix, [[Henri La Fontaine|Henri Lafontaine]], membre de la loge les \"Amis Philanthropes\" et professeur \u00e0 l'[[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]] (l'Universit\u00e9 nouvelle), la Ligue belge des Droits des femmes invite Maria Deraismes \u00e0 Bruxelles. Le mouvement est lanc\u00e9, et, malgr\u00e9 les obstacles, la premi\u00e8re loge de la [[Le Droit humain (Belgique)|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration belge du Droit Humain]] sera cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1912.<ref>M. Bruwier et ML Pirotte</ref>\n\nLe mouvement flamand et la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie belge. On ne peut pas dire que la p\u00e9riode hollandaise de la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie ([[1814]]-[[1830]]) verra une \"n\u00e9\u00e9rlandisation\" des loges situ\u00e9es en Flandre. La Grande loge d'administration m\u00e9ridionale \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e tr\u00e8s francophone et calqu\u00e9e sur ce qui existait au temps de l'Empire fran\u00e7ais. Il y avait cependant quelques travaux en Flamand. La loge le \"Septentrion\" de [[Gand]], m\u00eame si le flamand n'en \u00e9tait certainement pas exclus \u00e0 priori, n'a pas jou\u00e9, apparemment, un r\u00f4le majeur dans les mouvements flamands la\u00efcs. En effet, ceux-ci vont r\u00e9ellement \u00e9merger lors de la phase politique du [[Grand Orient de Belgique]]. Il s'agissait de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'emprise de l'[[\u00c9glise catholique romaine|\u00c9glise]] en [[Flandre]] sur les masses populaires. Cependant dans la partie flamande du pays, les franc-ma\u00e7ons se concentraient surtout dans les m\u00e9tropoles, Gand et Anvers, et la francisation progressive de la bourgeoise flamande \u00e9tait un fait r\u00e9el au cours du {{s-|XIX|e}}. Cette double caract\u00e9ristique va structurer le mouvement la\u00efc dans le nord du pays: il sera flamand et progressiste. D\u00e8s les ann\u00e9es [[1865]], c'est \u00e0 Anvers que le mouvement se structurera le plus autour du Willemsfonds et de la loge \"les Amis du Commerce et de la Pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance R\u00e9unis\". En [[1876]], la loge \"les Amis de Themis\" \u00e0 Anvers fut la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 travailler en flamand. En 1890, une scission de cette loge verra la cr\u00e9ation de la premi\u00e8re loge enti\u00e8rement flamande : \"Marnix de Sint-Aldegonde\".  Leurs actions, et on le comprend ais\u00e9ment, se concentraient principalement sur l'enseignement. Ils port\u00e8rent la \"question flamande\" sur la table du Grand Orient en 1874. Le Grand Orient adopta officiellement leur position politique en [[1875]], \u00e0 savoir la n\u00e9\u00e9rlandisation de l'enseignement de base en Flandre. Et en [[1883]], la nouvelle loi sur l'enseignement, vot\u00e9 par le parti lib\u00e9ral encore au pouvoir pour un an et tr\u00e8s proche \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque de la Franc-ma\u00e7onnerie, int\u00e9grera partiellement leur revendication.<ref>Els Witte</ref>\n--->\n\n== 20th century ==\nThe main defining feature of 20th century freemasonry was the creation of several female lodges, of mixed obediences.  The second half of the century was also characterised by the structuralisation of international freemasonry into two blocks.\n\n===To 1914===\nIn 1900, [[Eug\u00e8ne Goblet d'Alviella|Goblet d'Alviella]] became president of the Supreme Council (Upper Degrees of the [[Scottish Rite|Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]]), after having been president of the Grand Orient of Belgium.  He had an important international impact, organising the international conference of Supreme Councils in Brussels in 1907, at which 21/25 Supreme Councils were represented, including those from the United States of America but with the notable exceptions of the 3 \"Supreme Councils\" of Great Britain. This conference was repeated in Washington in 1912 and in Lausanne in 1922. In 1913, the Supreme Council of Belgium delivered the patents of constitutions from the Supreme Council of the Netherlands.  It was at this moment that Freemasonry first took on a new international unity.<ref>Clement (ter)</ref>\n\nWithout denying its past, at the start of the 20th century Belgian Freemasonry and its practices were now more classical in appearance, in an appeased spirit and very different to its appearance a hundred years before - obedience to the symbolic degrees (the first three degrees), to the Upper Degrees, often directed by the same man - in short, a Freemasonry that was expanding.  Nevertheless, from this communal base, Belgian Freemasonry little by little became more diverse.  A large part of Belgian Freemasonry as it stands today derives from this Grand Orient - Supr\u00eame Conseil unity at the start of the 20th century.  The lay Flemish struggle, emanating from the [[Antwerp]] and [[Ghent]] lodges, at this point concentrated on the Flemishisation of the [[University of Ghent]].\n\n===Women===\n{{See also|Women and Freemasonry}}\nThe main development in early 20th century Belgian Freemasonry, however, was the birth of mixed female-male Freemasonry and women's assertion of their equal right with men to become masons.  The first female Belgian Freemason was [[Isabelle Gatti de Gamond]], initiated in the \"Diderot\" lodge of the Grand Symbolic Scottish Rite Lodge (French in origin) around 1903.  She was later invited to a Masonic meeting at the \"Amis philanthropes\" lodge, but she fell sick (dying in 1905) and this meeting did not occur.  In 1905 the first lodge of [[Le Droit Humain]] was created in [[Amsterdam]], the Cazotte lodge (number 13), inaugurated by [[Georges Martin (Freemason)|Georges Martin]]: a delegation from the \"Amis du Commerce et de la Pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance R\u00e9unis\" and \"Amis Philanthropes\" lodges was sent to it and these two lodges decided to affiliate to it, with the idea of creating a lodge of this jurisdiction in Belgium.  Concerning the presence of women in a lodge, the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]] pronounced the recreation of [[rite of adoption|lodges of adoption]] in the image of those of 18th century French lodges of that type!  These lodges of adoption formed the basis for the creation of the  [[Grande Loge f\u00e9minine de France]] after the [[Second World War]].\n\nOn 21 November 1910, the \"les Amis Philanthropes\" lodge, under the presidency of [[Henri La Fontaine|Henri Lafontaine]], welcomed the founder of [[Le Droit Humain]] along with [[Maria Deraismes]], Georges Martin and other male and female Freemasons to a conference.  The Grand Orient quietly condemned the move, and the \"Les Amis Philanthropes\" lodge split, speeding up the formation of the first [[Le Droit Humain]] lodge in Belgium out of the pro-female masons who had split from \"Les Amis Philanthropes\".  This was to be the \"\u00c9galit\u00e9\" (\"Equality\") lodge, number 45, which was officially inaugurated in 1912.  Unfortunately the death of [[Isabelle Gatti de Gamond]] meant the new lodge had no high-profile woman to recruit for it and so was mainly made up of men.  Only in the inter-war period did women take up leadership responsibilities in this jurisdiction in Belgium, which became autonomous in 1928 with (at first) 6 lodges.<ref>See M Bruwier and ML Pirotte</ref>  This autonomy came with the 1928 formation of the [[Belgian Federation of Le Droit Humain|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration belge du Droit Humain]] as a mixed-sex Grand Lodge, and saw a continuing expansion (whilst the Grand Orient of Belgium seeing its numbers neither rise nor fall during the inter-war period and remaining hostile to the Droit Humain until after the Second World War).  The [[Grande Loge f\u00e9minine de France]] was created in 1952, with a solely female membership.  This jurisdiction later created lodges in other countries, with Belgium' first forming in 1974.  The [[Freemasonry in Belgium#Women's Grand Lodge of Belgium|Women's Grand Lodge Of Belgium]] formed in 1981.\n\n===1914-1945===\nDuring the First World War Belgium was almost wholly occupied by Germany and the lodges suspended their operations.  The period was marked by the \"Call to the Grand Lodges of Germany\" organised by [[Charles Magnette]], Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Belgium, on 27 September 1914, aiming to have the occupying troops exactions on the Belgians examined by an independent commission.  This received two polite responses from seven close jurisdictions.  Magnette relapsed on 7 November 1915 to prevent the massive deportation of Belgian workers to Germany and was arrested and imprisoned by the occupying authorities for subversion for the duration.<ref>GOB</ref>  The lodges resumed their work when peace came, but found new enemies in the dictators of the right and left (with the former finding Masonry's emphasis on free thought dangerous, and the latter reproaching it for \"class collaboration\").\n\nIn 1921 the \"Association Ma\u00e7onnique Internationale\" (A.M.I.) was created on the initiative of the Swiss Grand Lodge Alpina and with the active participation of [[Charles Magnette]].  Like the vast majority of international Freemasonry (with the notable exception of the Grand United Lodge of England), the Grand Orient of Belgium adhered to this organisation, though the Grand Lodges of New York and the Netherlands soon left it.\n\nOn the German invasion on 10 May 1940, Freemasonry was banned.  With the aid of a list of Freemasons published in a conservative Catholic newspaper,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} the occupiers arrested, deported and assassinated several Masons, such as Georges P\u00eatre, president of the supreme council in 1942, and [[Jules Hiernaux]], Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Belgium in 1944.  Belgian Masonic life continued in exile in London and New York, and even secretly in the concentration camp at [[Esterwegen]] (the \"[[Libert\u00e9 ch\u00e9rie]]\" lodge) and the PoW camp at [[Prenslau]] (the \"[[L'Obstin\u00e9e]]\" lodge).\n\n===Post-war===\nOn Belgium's liberation, Masonry resumed but its numbers had fallen by a quarter.  In 1950, the \"Association Ma\u00e7onnique Internationale\" was dissolved by the [[Grande Loge suisse Alpina]] which had created it.  On 15 May 1954 the Convention of Luxembourg was signed, combining the United Grand Lodges of Germany, the Grand Orient of the Netherlands, the [[Grande loge suisse Alpina]], etc.  This convention enumerated the six proofs of regularity to which jurisdictions had to subscribe in order to be mutually recognised.  The United Grand Lodge of England later joined this movement, becoming the regulator of Masonic regularity. The schism between [[Regular Masonic jurisdictions|\"regular\"]] and \"liberal\" Freemasonry became official at this date, even if in 1958 the Grand Orient of the Netherlands unsuccessfully tried to reconcile the Grands Orient de France and Grand Orient of Belgium to the international movement which it was creating.  In 1959 5 lodges aspiring to greater \"regularity\" formed the \"[[Freemasonry in Belgium#Grand Lodge of Belgium|Grand Lodge of Belgium]]\", dragging in their wake Belgium's Supreme Council, which broke off relations with the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]] in 1960.  The Grand Lodge of Belgium was recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England in 1965.  On 22 January 1961, in reaction, the [[CLIPSAS]] was created to gather together the \"liberal\" jurisdictions (most important among them the Grand Orient of Belgium, the Grand Orient de France and the Droit Humain).  This grouping ran into difficulties in 1995, leading to the creation of \"AMIL\".\n\nIn 1979, a schism occurred in the [[Freemasonry in Belgium#Grand Lodge of Belgium|Grand Lodge of Belgium]] with the creation of the [[Freemasonry in Belgium#Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium|Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium]], dragging along a so-called \"Grand et Supr\u00eame Conseil de Belgique\" via a schism in the Supreme Council of Belgium.  This new Grand Lodge finally became the only one in Belgium to be recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England.  This led to a rapprochement between the [[Freemasonry in Belgium#Grand Lodge of Belgium|Grand Lodge of Belgium]] and the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]], with accords of mutual recognition and cooperation officialised in 1989.\n\nNew Upper Degrees jurisdictions were also created: the \"[[Scottish Rite of 1962|Grand Coll\u00e8ge du Rite \u00c9cossais pour la Belgique]]\" (originally recruiting only from the Grand Orient of Belgium), the remains of the \"Supreme Council ''of'' Belgium\" (originally recruiting only from the Gand Lodge) and the \"Supreme Council ''for'' Belgium\" (originally recruiting from both). Later both these all-male \"Supreme Councils\" were merged. Even Belgium's male-female [[Belgian Federation of Le Droit Humain|Droit Humain]] and the [[Freemasonry in Belgium#Women's Grand Lodge of Belgium|Grande Loge F\u00e9minine]] have their own systems of Upper Degrees.\n\nOther jurisdictions and rites were also present in Belgian, but in a quite secretive manner.  Among them, the most important rite was the [[Rite of Memphis-Misraim]], long present in Belgium and now co-operating with most of the \"liberal\" Belgian masonic associations.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century, Belgian freemasonry thus had a very diversified appearance and a great wealth of practices, with a number of female and male freemasons that it has not reached since its origins.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*R Desmed.

The Amateur Trapshooting Association (ATA)<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.shootata.com/\n| title = Amateur Trapshooting Association > Home\n| website = Shootata.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-27\n}}</ref> sanctions events throughout the United States and Canada, as well as the Pacific International Trapshooting Association (PITA) which sanctions events on the West Coast of North America.\n\nTrap shooting was originally developed, in part, to augment bird hunting and to provide a method of practice for bird hunters. Use of targets was introduced as a replacement for live [[pigeon-shooting]]. Indeed, one of the names for the targets used in shooting games is ''clay pigeons''. The layout of a modern trap shooting field differs from that of a skeet field and/or a sporting clays course.\n\nTrap shooting has been a sport since the late 18th century when real birds were used; usually the [[passenger pigeon]], which was extremely abundant at the time. Birds were placed under hats or in traps which were then released. Artificial birds were introduced around the time of the [[American Civil War]]. Glass balls (Bogardus) and subsequently \"clay\" targets were introduced in the later 1800s,<ref name = shotgungames/> gaining wide acceptance.\n\n==Arms and equipment==\n[[File:Skeet. William H. Keever, USA.JPEG|thumb|right|upright=1.2|A competitor at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] trap shooting with an over/under [[double-barreled shotgun]]]]\nTrap shooting is typically shot with a 12 gauge [[shotgun]]. Smaller [[gauge]] firearms (e.g. 16, 20, 28 gauge) can be used, but no allowance is given. Trap shooting is shot at either single or double target presentations. This refers to the number of clay targets which are launched simultaneously.\n\nBoth general purpose [[shotgun]]s and more specialized target-type shotguns are used in trap shooting, and may be [[double-barreled shotgun|double-barreled]] or single-barreled. Shooters who shoot all sub-events will often buy a combination-set of a single and double barrel for shooting both singles and double targets respectively. Self-loading ([[semi-automatic shotgun]]s) are popular for recreational shooting due to the lower perceived recoil and versatility because they can be used for singles, handicap, and doubles. Shotguns used in trap shooting can differ from field and skeet guns in several ways and normally are designed with a higher \"point of impact\" as the targets are intended to be shot as they rise.\n\nTrap shooting shotguns can be adjustable. Stocks may have a \"[[Monte Carlo stock|Monte Carlo]]\" (fixed, raised \"comb\") configuration and/or include a comb height adjustment, a butt plate adjustment for length, angle, or both. Trap guns typically have longer barrels of {{convert|750|\u2013|850|mm|in|abbr=on}}, possibly with porting and featuring tighter [[Choke (firearms)|chokes]] to compensate for the longer distances at which trap shooting targets are broken. The majority of trap shotguns built today feature interchangeable choke tubes as opposed to older guns which used chokes of a \"fixed\" constriction. Interchangeable choke tubes can come in a variety of constrictions and may use names such as \"modified\", \"improved cylinder\", and \"full\". Trap guns are built to withstand the demands and stress of constant and lengthy repeated use\u2014hundreds of shots in a single day of events, whereas typical field guns are built to be lighter, carried afield, and not shot in such quantity.\n\nCommon accessories include wearing a vest or pouch that will hold at least 25\u201350 cartridges or \"shells\" for singles and/or doubles events. Most ranges and clubs require eye and ear protection.\n\nShooting glasses may be something as simple as the eyeglasses or sunglasses one presently wears. Specialized shooting glasses typically have interchangeable colored lenses, are adjustable, and designed for high-impact resistance. A spectrum of different colored lenses are offered to compensate for light conditions as well as enhance the color of the target thrown while muting the color of the background. Adjustable glasses allow on-range changes for conditions of light, color, etc.\n\nHearing protection also comes in a variety of styles. Dense foam and electronics are used to reduce sound levels. Typical hearing protection is either an \"earmuff\" (worn over the ear) or an \"ear plug\" (worn in the [[ear canal]]). Some shooters use both simultaneously to gain greater noise reduction ([[Earplug#Noise Reduction Ratings (NRR)|NRR]]). There are also \"ear plugs\" molded to the shape of the ear, which can be used for listening to music while shooting.\n\n===Trap machines and target launching methods===\nTrap shooting requires the use of a target throwing device(s). American trap and DTL utilize a single trap machine which is typically enclosed within a traphouse, downrange from the shooters' shooting positions. The house provides protection for the machine (e.g. from weather and errant shots) and also acts to obscure the machine's oscillating throwing position. International or Olympic trap employs 15 trap machines housed within a large elongated traphouse recessed into the ground to form a \"bunker\" and/or resemble a trench. International or Olympic trap may at times be referred to as bunker trap.\n\nModern automatic throwing machines can store hundreds of clay targets in a carousel and systematically self-load targets onto the throwing mechanism. Manual electric target throwers require a person in the trap house with the trap machine to set the target(s) by hand onto the machine arm. For both types, an electrical signal, from the push of a button or a sound-activated device, causes the trap machine to throw its targets after the shooter calls for their bird(s).\n\nTemporary or informal trap shooting can utilize other methods to launch targets. The simplest is a \"hand thrower\" which is a hand-held arm which holds and releases that target when a person swings it. Another type of manual, non-electrical thrower utilizes a spring-loaded mechanism which is cocked and subsequently released by hand or foot.\n\n==Ammunition==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2019}}\n[[Image:Cal12 N\u00b08.jpg|thumb|A 12-gauge [[shotgun shell]] in a transparent plastic hull, allowing the contents to be seen]]\nAmerican trap typically uses lead shot ammunition, with shot sizes (for lead shot) ranging between #7 \u00bd and #9 (2.0\u20132.4&nbsp;mm)<!-- {{convert}} doesn't work with gauge, so I'll leave this alone -->. The major components of a shotshell are the \"hull\" (casing), \"primer\" (ignition device), \"powder\" ([[smokeless gunpowder]]), \"wad\" (shot cup and cushion), and \"shot\" (round pellets).\n{{further|Shotgun shell}}\nThe \"shot\" in a \"shotshell\" consists of approximately 300\u2013450 small spheres. Shotshells are allowed a maximum payload weight of {{convert|32|g|oz|frac=8|order=flip|abbr=on}} of shot. Velocity may vary but is limited based upon shot mass: {{convert|1290|ft/s|m/s}} for {{convert|32|g|oz|frac=8|order=flip|abbr=on}}, {{convert|1325|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} for {{convert|28|g|oz|frac=8|order=flip|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|1350|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} for {{convert|24|g|oz|frac=8|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Maximum loads are generally only needed for longer \"handicap\" yardages or the second shot in doubles trap. [[Steel shot]], which may be required at certain trap clubs or ranges, is used with slightly larger shot size (e.g. #6 or #7).\n\nQuality ammunition is readily available from a variety of companies including [[Winchester]], [[Remington]], Federal, [[Fiocchi]], and Rio. Ammunition may be marketed as \"premium\" or other. Manufacturers price their ammunition accordingly. The quality of the hull construction, shot, powder and primer components impacts the price of shotshells.\n\nReloading or self-loading of ammunition is popular among a segment of trap shooters, due in part to the sheer quantity of ammunition used in trap shooting as well as the fact that many ranges will have shells that are used only once and are able to be obtained by people who reload their own shells at little to no cost. Reloading can be economical and allows for the ability to customize a shotshell \"recipe\" to one's shooting, making reloading attractive and adds another dimension to the enjoyment of shotgun shooting sports. \n\n==History==\nTrap shooting has been around since the 18th century. A publication known as ''[[Sporting Magazine]]'' states that by the year 1793, trap shooting was \"well established\" in England.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Gun Digest Book of Trap & Skeet Shooting 5th edition |last=Snapp|first=Rick|publisher=Gun Digest Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-44020-388-6 |location=Iola, WI|page=17}}</ref><ref name =shotgungames>{{cite magazine|title=Shotgun games |last=Johnston |first=Jeff |magazine=American Hunter |date=July 2013 |pages=40-41}}</ref> The first recorded organized trap shooting in the United States is likely to have taken place at the Sportsman's Club of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1831.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Gun Digest Book of Trap & Skeet Shooting 5th Edition |last=Snapp |first=Rick |publisher=Gun Digest Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-44020-388-6 |location=Lola, WI|page=17}}</ref><ref name = shotgungames/> Originally, live birds were used as targets, released from under hats.<ref name = shotgungames/> Glass balls came into use as targets in the 1860s and began to partially replace live birds, but live targets are still used in some parts of the United States.<ref name=\"live\">Bensalem pigeon shoot highlights need for new law in Pennsylvania</ref><ref name = shotgungames/> The glass ball targets were invented by Charles Portlock, of Boston, and were used by notable shooters such as [[Annie Oakley]], [[William Frank Carver|Doc Carver]], and [[Adam Bogardus|Capt.

He was known as one of the most successful trap shooters in the early years of the sport. In the spring of 1883 he was defeated by a competitive shooter named Doc Carver. Carver idolized Bogardus and other renowned shooters. He attempted to attract the great Bogardus, but it wasn't until six years later that the two legends finally came together for a match, and the winner was the less-experienced Doc Carver. Carver won 19 out of 25 matches. In most of those matches they used Ligowsky targets.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1880 \"clay\" birds (disks) were invented by a man named Fred Kimble, although George Ligowsky took credit for the invention.<ref name=\"shotgungames\" /> The Ligowsky target was used widely in the early trap shooting community as a replacement for the glass ball targets. The downside of the Ligowsky targets was that they were too hard to break when hit. Fred Kimble made a more breakable target. Unlike the Ligowsky target, which was made of hard baked clay, the Kimble target was made of coal-tar, pitch and other ingredients.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Competition fast, friendly at station biannual skeet shoot 120414-M-EY704-765.jpg|thumb|A modern, automatic trap machine.]]\nThere were many different types of target throwers, also known as \u201ctraps,\u201d like one made by Bogardus, which was made to throw glass targets. This trap was able to throw the targets for a distance of {{convert|28 to 35|yd|m}}. It was operated by a person behind the shooter, who pulled a string and released an elastic spring, launching the target. The first automatic trap machine to launch clay targets was used in 1909.<ref name=\"shotgungames\" /> Following the invention of the automatic trap machines, doubles trap was introduced. It was a big success in the competition community. In the 1912 Olympics, [[Jay Graham]] became the first American to win the gold medal in doubles trap.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThree years later, in 1915 the American Amateur Trapshooting Association (AATA) was formed with [[John Philip Sousa]] as president. This organization was the first organized and run by amateurs. When the AATA was disbanded in 1919, it was absorbed by an organization called the American Trapshooting Association. In 1923 the American Trapshooting Association was renamed [[Amateur Trapshooting Association]], and the same organization is still active today.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==International versions==\n{{Main article|Olympic trap|Double trap}}\n\n===Olympic trap (bunker trap)===\n'''Olympic trap''', also known as international and/or bunker trap, is one of the [[ISSF shooting events]], introduced to the Olympic program in 1900; the current version was introduced in 1950. In international competitions the course of fire is 125 shots for men and 75 shots for women. There is a 25-shot final for the top six competitors. Several photos of a bunker facility are shown.\n\nOlympic trap uses 15 fixed-angle machines as opposed to the single oscillating machine used in American trap or DTL. The 15-machine, computer-controlled program is designed to deliver 10 left, 10 right and 5 straight-away targets to each competitor in a randomized sequence. A microphone release system is employed to provide uniformity in target release times.\n\nThe process of a round is as follows: There are six shooters, one to each station, with the sixth shooter initially starting at a holding station immediately behind shooter number one. At the beginning of first round of the day, test firing is allowed at the referee's permission. Upon receiving the start signal, the first shooter has 10 seconds to call for his target. After firing at his target, the first shooter waits for the second shooter to complete firing, then moves to station two, with the shooter on station six smoothly moving to station one. This procedure continues through the squad until the completion of the round.\n\nGenerally, the round is refereed by a person on the line, behind the shooters. They use a bicycle-type horn, or similar, to signal lost targets. The referee is assisted by one or two flankers to either side of the bunker who keep score. With modern technology, computer screens may be used both at the bunker and in the club house to show the rounds' progress. In major matches, there is a board, perhaps 1 \u00d7 2.5 m (4 \u00d7 8 feet), to one side that shows the scoring status clearly to all with large tiles: white to show hits, red to show misses.\n\nThe guns may be loaded\u2014but open-actioned\u2014between stations 1 through 5. Guns must be unloaded and open in the walk from station five back to one. The unloading must be done ''before'' the shooter makes the turn to step off station five. This open action requirement alone tends to discourage the use of auto-loading shotguns, as it is time consuming to unload if the second shell is not used. Additionally, there are issues of reliability and the loss of the advantage which a more open choke of the over-under shotgun type can provide for the first shot.\n\nSince the UIT, now ISSF, mandated the 24&nbsp;gram (7/8 ounce) shot load in 1991, chokes have tended to become tighter. Often competitors will use 0.64\u20130.72&nbsp;mm (0.025\u20130.030&nbsp;inch) for the first barrel and 0.80\u20131.00&nbsp;mm (0.032\u20130.040&nbsp;inch) for the second. Guns are regulated to shoot dead on or, at most 5\u20138&nbsp;cm (2\u20133&nbsp;inches) high. Considerable effort is expended to ensure a perfect fit as the relatively high 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) exit speed of the target allows no time for conscious compensation of a poor fit as it so often can occur in the slower 64&nbsp;km/h (40&nbsp;mph) exit speed target games of American trap and skeet.\n\n===Double trap===\n'''Double trap''' is a relatively new trap form. An Olympic event since 1996 (from 2008 it has Olympic status only for men), two targets are thrown simultaneously but at slightly different angles from the station three bank of machines. The target speed is about 80&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph), very close to that of ATA doubles.\n\nThe only unique item is that the targets are released with a variable delay up to 1 second. This was instituted to minimize the practice of spot-shooting the first target.\n\nThe ISSF has continuously adjusted the difficulties of its disciplines (trap, skeet, and double trap) to minimize the number of perfect scores, unlike ATA/NSSA where perfect scores are the norm. Missing a single target in a large ATA or NSSA match means the competitor has a limited chance of winning, whereas missing a target in Bunker or International Trap still allows a competitor a good shot at victory.\n\nWith her victory in women's skeet shooting at the [[2012 London Olympic games]], [[Kim Rhode]] became the first American to medal in 5 successive Olympic games. Her prior Olympic medals were for doubles trap shooting in 1996, 2000 and 2004 and for skeet shooting in 2008.<ref name =shotgungames/>\n\n==Nationally and regionally recognized versions==\n===American trap===\nAmerican trap is popular throughout the United States and may be the most popular form of clay target shooting in North America. It is widely practiced at clubs and facilities that offer trap shooting.\n\nTrap shooting outside of any official event is common and arguably the majority of American trap shooting. Most official events are governed by the [http://www.shootata.com/ Amateur Trapshooting Association or ATA]<ref>{{cite web|title = Amateur Trapshooting Association > Home|url = http://www.shootata.com|website = Shootata.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}</ref> and its rules. The ATA is the primary governing body of American trap shooting and is one of the largest shooting sports organizations in the world. The Pacific International Trap Association (PITA) is an independent governing body, and is active in the western US and British Columbia. PITA rules are nearly identical to ATA rules. Trapshooting outside of official events follows ATA rules and norms to widely varying degrees.\n\nThe ATA hosts the Grand American World Trap Shooting Championships, which is held every August. After decades in [[Vandalia, Ohio]], the \"Grand\" moved to the new [[World Shooting and Recreational Complex]] in [[Sparta, Illinois]]. The Grand attracts 4,500 (2015 numbers) shooters for the thirteen-day event. It was billed as the world's largest shooting event until the [[USA High School Clay Target League]]'s Minnesota State Championship held in [[Alexandria, MN]] reached over 5,000 participants in June, 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kstp.com/article/stories/s3823276.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930135521/http://kstp.com/article/stories/s3823276.shtml |archivedate=2015-09-30 }} </ref> The Grand American is still the largest ATA event.\n\nThe ATA sanctions registered trap shooting competitions at local clubs and facilities throughout North America, and it coordinates Zone competitions leading up to the Grand American each summer along with \"Satellite Grands\" throughout the U.S. State organizations hold state championship shoots each year, which are coordinated with and sanctioned by the ATA.\n\nAmerican Trap is broken down into three categories: singles, doubles, handicap. The targets are thrown by a machine located at approximately ground level and covered by a \"trap house.\" For singles and doubles, there are five \"stations\", each 16 yards (15.6 m) behind the trap house. In singles, each competitor shoots at five targets from each station. The trap machine oscillates left to right within a 54 degree arc (up to 27 degrees right and left of center), and at least a 34 degree arc (up to 17 degrees right and left of center).,<ref name = ATA2007>ATA Rules, ByLaws, Policies and Other Shooter Information by Amateur Trapshooting Association, Vandalia Ohio September 1, 2007 reprinting Page 48</ref> and the competitor does not know where in that arc the target will emerge. In doubles, the machine does not oscillate, but throws two targets simultaneously with each competitor shooting at five (5) pairs (10 targets) from each station. In the handicap events, the machine operates the same as in singles, but the shooters stand farther away from the trap house.\n\nRecent changes specify a minimum handicap yardage of 18 yards (16.5m). Each time a competitor wins an event or shoots a score of 96 or higher, s/he may earn additional yardage (also known as \"getting a punch\"), and must thereafter shoot from farther away from the traphouse. The increase in effective distance is designed to increase difficulty. The maximum distance at which a handicap sub-event is shot is 27 yards (24.7 m). Safety regulations prohibit members of a handicap squad from shooting at varying yardages of more than 2-3 yards (1.8m-2.7m) apart, depending upon the handicap classification. In American Trap, each shooter is allowed only one shot per target. Unless the target was an illegal target, in which case the target is either broken or has broken regulations the shooter may reshoot that bird.\n\nWhen shooting American Trap for practice or fun, a squad of up to five individuals will shoot a \"round\" of trap which equals 25 targets per participant. Registered ATA events may require each shooter to shoot 50, 100 or 200 targets, depending upon the scheduled sub-event. Many of these shoots are for personal average or handicap yardage.<ref name = ATA2007/>\n\nATA rules specify that shotgun gauges larger than 12 gauge (such as 10 gauge) are not permissible.<ref name = ATA2007/> Maximum shot velocity is 1290 FPS (Feet Per Second) for shot charges up to 1 1/8 oz. and 1325 FPS for shot charges up to 1 oz.<ref name = ATA2007/>\n\nA variant of standard trap is Wobble or Wobble trap. The main difference is a more variable target flight path than in standard trap shooting because the trap machine oscillates up and down as well as side to side. Shooters are allowed two shots per pull, and shooters at stations 1 and 5 stand at the 18 yard (16.5 m) mark while positions 2\u20134 stand at the 17 yard (15.5 m) mark. Although this version of trap is not sanctioned by the ATA, many shooters consider it to be both more challenging and engaging as well as a more realistic preparation for bird hunting.\n\n===Other nationally and regionally recognized forms===\n[[Down-The-Line]] (DTL) is a form of trap popular in [[Great Britain]], [[Australia]], and [[South Africa]]. The trap machine oscillates left to right within a 45 degree arc and each competitor shoots in turn, then moves station after having attempted 5 targets from each station in each round of 25 targets. Two shots are permitted at each target, but second shots incur a points penalty. 3 points are awarded for each first-barrel hit, 2 points for a second-barrel hit, and 0 for a miss. A perfect score in a 100-target competition is written as 100/300. The points score, rather than the number of targets hit, determines the winner and is used to determine classifications (AA, A, B and C class).\n\nIn the [[Nordic countries]] and [[Great Britain]] (which is part of the [[Nordic Shooting Region]]), a form of trap formerly known as ''Hunter's trap'' and now as Nordic trap is popular. It is easier than the Olympic version.\n\n==Etiquette and practices==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2020}}{{original research|section|date=February 2020}}\nTrap etiquette is expected and practiced more fully during official and competitive events, but, to a lesser extent, also during informal shooting. American Trapshooting, more so than other shooting disciplines, including Olympic \"international\" trap, develops a certain rhythm to a squad timing between shots. The manners of any other squad member(s) can affect the performance of individuals within a squad. Most persons using a semi-automatic shotgun employ a shell catcher - an ejected hull hitting an adjacent shooter in the head or arm can certainly disrupt their concentration. Most shooters carry a few extra shells in case they drop one or have a misfire. Shooters usually avoid picking up any dropped shell, or other item, until after the 5th shooter has fired their 5th shot of the station and the squad is about to rotate to the next position, or sometimes until the end of the entire round. Idle chatting between shots, vulgar calls, and unnecessary movement can be generally disruptive. Additionally, where voice-activated throwing systems are in use, talking between shots may be detected by nearby microphones and prematurely launch targets during another shooter's turn. \n\nCommands from the scorer and other shooters are as important to squad timing as the behaviors of the shooters on the squad. To start a squad the shooter will ask if the squad and puller are ready (usually by calling \"Squad ready?\" then \"Puller ready?\"), followed by asking to see one free target, traditionally saying, \"Let's see one.\" Especially during official and competitive events the scorer will call missed targets with a command of: loss, lost, etc. When the first shooter has fired their final shot of the position the scorer will sometimes call \"end\" or \"ready\" and will command \"all change\" or \"please move\" after fifth shooter has fired their last shot. The shooter on position five then moves behind the rest of the shooters on their way to the first station and will signal when he is ready to the first shooter who is now on station two. The standard call for a target is \"pull,\" but many shooters like to use their own variations of \"pull,\" or words that will help them concentrate on the target; such as, \"yah\", a grunt is acceptable, some may even use a whistle or beeper.\n\n==Technique==\nThe technique for trap shooting is fundamentally different from rifle or pistol shooting. The latter shoots one projectile and aims to place accurately at a usually stationary target, and usually with at least a few seconds to aim. Trap shooting involves shooting hundreds of pellets at a time, at a target that is moving quickly downrange, and often quickly laterally, typically with less than a second to move the gun and fire. Instructors generally refer to the process as \"pointing\" the shotgun rather than aiming it.<ref name = \"little\">''The Little Trapshooting Book'' by Frank Little  Published by Further Adventures Inc.

Teams compete at the local, state, and national level. Athletes are divided into four divisions based on academic grade level and experience: Rookie (fifth grade and below), Intermediate (sixth through eighth grades), Junior Varsity (ninth through twelfth grades), and Varsity (eleventh and twelfth grades with at least two years of experience at the Junior Varsity level). Trophies and college scholarships are awarded to third place, runner-up, and champion squads in each division at the SCTP National Championships, which are held concurrently with the first two days of the Grand American Trapshooting Championships in Sparta, Illinois.\n\nThe Amateur Trapshooting Association launched its youth program, AIM in October 2008. With about 3000 participants, the program, focusing on academics, integrity, and marksmanship, seeks to provide a safe and positive experience with firearms for youth, elementary through college age. AIM encourages good sportsmanship and personal responsibility through competition in order to make trap shooting a lifelong avocation. Categories and classes are designed to create a more level playing field and encourage genuine competition. Age based categories are established on the birthday of the shooter. Categories are Pre-Sub (11 and under), Sub-Junior (12\u201314), Junior (15\u201318) and Graduates/Collegiate (18\u201323). For purposes of determining age category the category declared by the participant on the first day he/she shoots shall be used. AIM Shooters have the opportunity to compete at local and State/Provincial levels as well as at the Grand American World Trapshooting Championships. The AIM Program offers the opportunity to compete in a unique sport that is heavily reliant on mental focus as well as enjoy the thrill and excitement of registered trap shooting.\n\nTo encourage young shooters, the ATA provides \"special categories\" for younger shooters who compete at ATA events. These categories include 'Junior' class for shooters who have not turned 18, and 'Sub-junior' for those not yet 15 as of the beginning of the ATA trap year (September 1). The ATA also allows shooters under the age of 18 to shoot for half-price at the Grand American as well as many other large ATA sponsored shoots. The ATA and state organizations such as the Texas Trapshooters' Association (TTA) award scholarships to college bound trap shooters based on citizenship, scholarship, and need. Numerous former TTA junior shooters are now attending college with the help of TTA and ATA scholarships.\n\nAdditionally, non-scholarship college teams are growing in popularity.

Non-Olympic shooting variants include [[Down-The-Line]], also known as \"DTL\", and Nordic Trap. American Trap is the predominant version in the United States and Canada.\n\nAmerican Trap has two independent governing bodies. The Amateur Trapshooting Association (ATA)<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.shootata.com/\n| title = Amateur Trapshooting Association > Home\n| website = Shootata.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-27\n}}</ref> sanctions events throughout the United States and Canada, as well as the Pacific International Trapshooting Association (PITA) which sanctions events on the West Coast of North America.\n\nTrap shooting was originally developed, in part, to augment bird hunting and to provide a method of practice for bird hunters. Use of targets was introduced as a replacement for live [[pigeon-shooting]]. Indeed, one of the names for the targets used in shooting games is ''clay pigeons''. The layout of a modern trap shooting field differs from that of a skeet field and/or a sporting clays course.\n\nTrap shooting has been a sport since the late 18th century when real birds were used; usually the [[passenger pigeon]], which was extremely abundant at the time. Birds were placed under hats or in traps which were then released. Artificial birds were introduced around the time of the [[American Civil War]]. Glass balls (Bogardus) and subsequently \"clay\" targets were introduced in the later 1800s,<ref name = shotgungames/> gaining wide acceptance.\n\n==Arms and equipment==\n[[File:Skeet. William H. Keever, USA.JPEG|thumb|right|upright=1.2|A competitor at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] trap shooting with an over/under [[double-barreled shotgun]]]]\nTrap shooting is typically shot with a 12 gauge [[shotgun]]. Smaller [[gauge]] firearms (e.g. 16, 20, 28 gauge) can be used, but no allowance is given. Trap shooting is shot at either single or double target presentations. This refers to the number of clay targets which are launched simultaneously.\n\nBoth general purpose [[shotgun]]s and more specialized target-type shotguns are used in trap shooting, and may be [[double-barreled shotgun|double-barreled]] or single-barreled. Shooters who shoot all sub-events will often buy a combination-set of a single and double barrel for shooting both singles and double targets respectively. Self-loading ([[semi-automatic shotgun]]s) are popular for recreational shooting due to the lower perceived recoil and versatility because they can be used for singles, handicap, and doubles. Shotguns used in trap shooting can differ from field and skeet guns in several ways and normally are designed with a higher \"point of impact\" as the targets are intended to be shot as they rise.\n\nTrap shooting shotguns can be adjustable. Stocks may have a \"[[Monte Carlo stock|Monte Carlo]]\" (fixed, raised \"comb\") configuration and/or include a comb height adjustment, a butt plate adjustment for length, angle, or both. Trap guns typically have longer barrels of {{convert|750|\u2013|850|mm|in|abbr=on}}, possibly with porting and featuring tighter [[Choke (firearms)|chokes]] to compensate for the longer distances at which trap shooting targets are broken. The majority of trap shotguns built today feature interchangeable choke tubes as opposed to older guns which used chokes of a \"fixed\" constriction. Interchangeable choke tubes can come in a variety of constrictions and may use names such as \"modified\", \"improved cylinder\", and \"full\". Trap guns are built to withstand the demands and stress of constant and lengthy repeated use\u2014hundreds of shots in a single day of events, whereas typical field guns are built to be lighter, carried afield, and not shot in such quantity.\n\nCommon accessories include wearing a vest or pouch that will hold at least 25\u201350 cartridges or \"shells\" for singles and/or doubles events. Most ranges and clubs require eye and ear protection.\n\nShooting glasses may be something as simple as the eyeglasses or sunglasses one presently wears. Specialized shooting glasses typically have interchangeable colored lenses, are adjustable, and designed for high-impact resistance. A spectrum of different colored lenses are offered to compensate for light conditions as well as enhance the color of the target thrown while muting the color of the background. Adjustable glasses allow on-range changes for conditions of light, color, etc.\n\nHearing protection also comes in a variety of styles. Dense foam and electronics are used to reduce sound levels. Typical hearing protection is either an \"earmuff\" (worn over the ear) or an \"ear plug\" (worn in the [[ear canal]]). Some shooters use both simultaneously to gain greater noise reduction ([[Earplug#Noise Reduction Ratings (NRR)|NRR]]). There are also \"ear plugs\" molded to the shape of the ear, which can be used for listening to music while shooting.\n\n===Trap machines and target launching methods===\nTrap shooting requires the use of a target throwing device(s). American trap and DTL utilize a single trap machine which is typically enclosed within a traphouse, downrange from the shooters' shooting positions. The house provides protection for the machine (e.g. from weather and errant shots) and also acts to obscure the machine's oscillating throwing position. International or Olympic trap employs 15 trap machines housed within a large elongated traphouse recessed into the ground to form a \"bunker\" and/or resemble a trench. International or Olympic trap may at times be referred to as bunker trap.\n\nModern automatic throwing machines can store hundreds of clay targets in a carousel and systematically self-load targets onto the throwing mechanism. Manual electric target throwers require a person in the trap house with the trap machine to set the target(s) by hand onto the machine arm. For both types, an electrical signal, from the push of a button or a sound-activated device, causes the trap machine to throw its targets after the shooter calls for their bird(s).\n\nTemporary or informal trap shooting can utilize other methods to launch targets. The simplest is a \"hand thrower\" which is a hand-held arm which holds and releases that target when a person swings it. Another type of manual, non-electrical thrower utilizes a spring-loaded mechanism which is cocked and subsequently released by hand or foot.\n\n==Ammunition==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2019}}\n[[Image:Cal12 N\u00b08.jpg|thumb|A 12-gauge [[shotgun shell]] in a transparent plastic hull, allowing the contents to be seen]]\nAmerican trap typically uses lead shot ammunition, with shot sizes (for lead shot) ranging between #7 \u00bd and #9 (2.0\u20132.4&nbsp;mm)<!-- {{convert}} doesn't work with gauge, so I'll leave this alone -->. The major components of a shotshell are the \"hull\" (casing), \"primer\" (ignition device), \"powder\" ([[smokeless gunpowder]]), \"wad\" (shot cup and cushion), and \"shot\" (round pellets).\n{{further|Shotgun shell}}\nThe \"shot\" in a \"shotshell\" consists of approximately 300\u2013450 small spheres. Shotshells are allowed a maximum payload weight of {{convert|32|g|oz|frac=8|order=flip|abbr=on}} of shot. Velocity may vary but is limited based upon shot mass: {{convert|1290|ft/s|m/s}} for {{convert|32|g|oz|frac=8|order=flip|abbr=on}}, {{convert|1325|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} for {{convert|28|g|oz|frac=8|order=flip|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|1350|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} for {{convert|24|g|oz|frac=8|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Maximum loads are generally only needed for longer \"handicap\" yardages or the second shot in doubles trap. [[Steel shot]], which may be required at certain trap clubs or ranges, is used with slightly larger shot size (e.g. #6 or #7).\n\nQuality ammunition is readily available from a variety of companies including [[Winchester]], [[Remington]], Federal, [[Fiocchi]], and Rio. Ammunition may be marketed as \"premium\" or other. Manufacturers price their ammunition accordingly. The quality of the hull construction, shot, powder and primer components impacts the price of shotshells.\n\nReloading or self-loading of ammunition is popular among a segment of trap shooters, due in part to the sheer quantity of ammunition used in trap shooting as well as the fact that many ranges will have shells that are used only once and are able to be obtained by people who reload their own shells at little to no cost. Reloading can be economical and allows for the ability to customize a shotshell \"recipe\" to one's shooting, making reloading attractive and adds another dimension to the enjoyment of shotgun shooting sports. \n\n==History==\nTrap shooting has been around since the 18th century. A publication known as ''[[Sporting Magazine]]'' states that by the year 1793, trap shooting was \"well established\" in England.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Gun Digest Book of Trap & Skeet Shooting 5th edition |last=Snapp|first=Rick|publisher=Gun Digest Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-44020-388-6 |location=Iola, WI|page=17}}</ref><ref name =shotgungames>{{cite magazine|title=Shotgun games |last=Johnston |first=Jeff |magazine=American Hunter |date=July 2013 |pages=40-41}}</ref> The first recorded organized trap shooting in the United States is likely to have taken place at the Sportsman's Club of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1831.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Gun Digest Book of Trap & Skeet Shooting 5th Edition |last=Snapp |first=Rick |publisher=Gun Digest Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-44020-388-6 |location=Lola, WI|page=17}}</ref><ref name = shotgungames/> Originally, live birds were used as targets, released from under hats.<ref name = shotgungames/> Glass balls came into use as targets in the 1860s and began to partially replace live birds, but live targets are still used in some parts of the United States.<ref name=\"live\">Bensalem pigeon shoot highlights need for new law in Pennsylvania</ref><ref name = shotgungames/> The glass ball targets were invented by Charles Portlock, of Boston, and were used by notable shooters such as [[Annie Oakley]], [[William Frank Carver|Doc Carver]], and [[Adam Bogardus|Capt.

He was known as one of the most successful trap shooters in the early years of the sport. In the spring of 1883 he was defeated by a competitive shooter named Doc Carver. Carver idolized Bogardus and other renowned shooters. He attempted to attract the great Bogardus, but it wasn't until six years later that the two legends finally came together for a match, and the winner was the less-experienced Doc Carver. Carver won 19 out of 25 matches. In most of those matches they used Ligowsky targets.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1880 \"clay\" birds (disks) were invented by a man named Fred Kimble, although George Ligowsky took credit for the invention.<ref name=\"shotgungames\" /> The Ligowsky target was used widely in the early trap shooting community as a replacement for the glass ball targets. The downside of the Ligowsky targets was that they were too hard to break when hit. Fred Kimble made a more breakable target. Unlike the Ligowsky target, which was made of hard baked clay, the Kimble target was made of coal-tar, pitch and other ingredients.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Competition fast, friendly at station biannual skeet shoot 120414-M-EY704-765.jpg|thumb|A modern, automatic trap machine.]]\nThere were many different types of target throwers, also known as \u201ctraps,\u201d like one made by Bogardus, which was made to throw glass targets. This trap was able to throw the targets for a distance of {{convert|28 to 35|yd|m}}. It was operated by a person behind the shooter, who pulled a string and released an elastic spring, launching the target. The first automatic trap machine to launch clay targets was used in 1909.<ref name=\"shotgungames\" /> Following the invention of the automatic trap machines, doubles trap was introduced. It was a big success in the competition community. In the 1912 Olympics, [[Jay Graham]] became the first American to win the gold medal in doubles trap.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThree years later, in 1915 the American Amateur Trapshooting Association (AATA) was formed with [[John Philip Sousa]] as president. This organization was the first organized and run by amateurs. When the AATA was disbanded in 1919, it was absorbed by an organization called the American Trapshooting Association. In 1923 the American Trapshooting Association was renamed [[Amateur Trapshooting Association]], and the same organization is still active today.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==International versions==\n{{Main article|Olympic trap|Double trap}}\n\n===Olympic trap (bunker trap)===\n'''Olympic trap''', also known as international and/or bunker trap, is one of the [[ISSF shooting events]], introduced to the Olympic program in 1900; the current version was introduced in 1950. In international competitions the course of fire is 125 shots for men and 75 shots for women. There is a 25-shot final for the top six competitors. Several photos of a bunker facility are shown.\n\nOlympic trap uses 15 fixed-angle machines as opposed to the single oscillating machine used in American trap or DTL. The 15-machine, computer-controlled program is designed to deliver 10 left, 10 right and 5 straight-away targets to each competitor in a randomized sequence. A microphone release system is employed to provide uniformity in target release times.\n\nThe process of a round is as follows: There are six shooters, one to each station, with the sixth shooter initially starting at a holding station immediately behind shooter number one. At the beginning of first round of the day, test firing is allowed at the referee's permission. Upon receiving the start signal, the first shooter has 10 seconds to call for his target. After firing at his target, the first shooter waits for the second shooter to complete firing, then moves to station two, with the shooter on station six smoothly moving to station one. This procedure continues through the squad until the completion of the round.\n\nGenerally, the round is refereed by a person on the line, behind the shooters. They use a bicycle-type horn, or similar, to signal lost targets. The referee is assisted by one or two flankers to either side of the bunker who keep score. With modern technology, computer screens may be used both at the bunker and in the club house to show the rounds' progress. In major matches, there is a board, perhaps 1 \u00d7 2.5 m (4 \u00d7 8 feet), to one side that shows the scoring status clearly to all with large tiles: white to show hits, red to show misses.\n\nThe guns may be loaded\u2014but open-actioned\u2014between stations 1 through 5. Guns must be unloaded and open in the walk from station five back to one. The unloading must be done ''before'' the shooter makes the turn to step off station five. This open action requirement alone tends to discourage the use of auto-loading shotguns, as it is time consuming to unload if the second shell is not used. Additionally, there are issues of reliability and the loss of the advantage which a more open choke of the over-under shotgun type can provide for the first shot.\n\nSince the UIT, now ISSF, mandated the 24&nbsp;gram (7/8 ounce) shot load in 1991, chokes have tended to become tighter. Often competitors will use 0.64\u20130.72&nbsp;mm (0.025\u20130.030&nbsp;inch) for the first barrel and 0.80\u20131.00&nbsp;mm (0.032\u20130.040&nbsp;inch) for the second. Guns are regulated to shoot dead on or, at most 5\u20138&nbsp;cm (2\u20133&nbsp;inches) high. Considerable effort is expended to ensure a perfect fit as the relatively high 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) exit speed of the target allows no time for conscious compensation of a poor fit as it so often can occur in the slower 64&nbsp;km/h (40&nbsp;mph) exit speed target games of American trap and skeet.\n\n===Double trap===\n'''Double trap''' is a relatively new trap form. An Olympic event since 1996 (from 2008 it has Olympic status only for men), two targets are thrown simultaneously but at slightly different angles from the station three bank of machines. The target speed is about 80&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph), very close to that of ATA doubles.\n\nThe only unique item is that the targets are released with a variable delay up to 1 second. This was instituted to minimize the practice of spot-shooting the first target.\n\nThe ISSF has continuously adjusted the difficulties of its disciplines (trap, skeet, and double trap) to minimize the number of perfect scores, unlike ATA/NSSA where perfect scores are the norm. Missing a single target in a large ATA or NSSA match means the competitor has a limited chance of winning, whereas missing a target in Bunker or International Trap still allows a competitor a good shot at victory.\n\nWith her victory in women's skeet shooting at the [[2012 London Olympic games]], [[Kim Rhode]] became the first American to medal in 5 successive Olympic games. Her prior Olympic medals were for doubles trap shooting in 1996, 2000 and 2004 and for skeet shooting in 2008.<ref name =shotgungames/>\n\n==Nationally and regionally recognized versions==\n===American trap===\nAmerican trap is popular throughout the United States and may be the most popular form of clay target shooting in North America. It is widely practiced at clubs and facilities that offer trap shooting.\n\nTrap shooting outside of any official event is common and arguably the majority of American trap shooting. Most official events are governed by the [http://www.shootata.com/ Amateur Trapshooting Association or ATA]<ref>{{cite web|title = Amateur Trapshooting Association > Home|url = http://www.shootata.com|website = Shootata.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}</ref> and its rules. The ATA is the primary governing body of American trap shooting and is one of the largest shooting sports organizations in the world. The Pacific International Trap Association (PITA) is an independent governing body, and is active in the western US and British Columbia. PITA rules are nearly identical to ATA rules. Trapshooting outside of official events follows ATA rules and norms to widely varying degrees.\n\nThe ATA hosts the Grand American World Trap Shooting Championships, which is held every August. After decades in [[Vandalia, Ohio]], the \"Grand\" moved to the new [[World Shooting and Recreational Complex]] in [[Sparta, Illinois]]. The Grand attracts 4,500 (2015 numbers) shooters for the thirteen-day event. It was billed as the world's largest shooting event until the [[USA High School Clay Target League]]'s Minnesota State Championship held in [[Alexandria, MN]] reached over 5,000 participants in June, 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kstp.com/article/stories/s3823276.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930135521/http://kstp.com/article/stories/s3823276.shtml |archivedate=2015-09-30 }} </ref> The Grand American is still the largest ATA event.\n\nThe ATA sanctions registered trap shooting competitions at local clubs and facilities throughout North America, and it coordinates Zone competitions leading up to the Grand American each summer along with \"Satellite Grands\" throughout the U.S. State organizations hold state championship shoots each year, which are coordinated with and sanctioned by the ATA.\n\nAmerican Trap is broken down into three categories: singles, doubles, handicap. The targets are thrown by a machine located at approximately ground level and covered by a \"trap house.\" For singles and doubles, there are five \"stations\", each 16 yards (15.6 m) behind the trap house. In singles, each competitor shoots at five targets from each station. The trap machine oscillates left to right within a 54 degree arc (up to 27 degrees right and left of center), and at least a 34 degree arc (up to 17 degrees right and left of center).,<ref name = ATA2007>ATA Rules, ByLaws, Policies and Other Shooter Information by Amateur Trapshooting Association, Vandalia Ohio September 1, 2007 reprinting Page 48</ref> and the competitor does not know where in that arc the target will emerge. In doubles, the machine does not oscillate, but throws two targets simultaneously with each competitor shooting at five (5) pairs (10 targets) from each station. In the handicap events, the machine operates the same as in singles, but the shooters stand farther away from the trap house.\n\nRecent changes specify a minimum handicap yardage of 18 yards (16.5m). Each time a competitor wins an event or shoots a score of 96 or higher, s/he may earn additional yardage (also known as \"getting a punch\"), and must thereafter shoot from farther away from the traphouse. The increase in effective distance is designed to increase difficulty. The maximum distance at which a handicap sub-event is shot is 27 yards (24.7 m). Safety regulations prohibit members of a handicap squad from shooting at varying yardages of more than 2-3 yards (1.8m-2.7m) apart, depending upon the handicap classification. In American Trap, each shooter is allowed only one shot per target. Unless the target was an illegal target, in which case the target is either broken or has broken regulations the shooter may reshoot that bird.\n\nWhen shooting American Trap for practice or fun, a squad of up to five individuals will shoot a \"round\" of trap which equals 25 targets per participant. Registered ATA events may require each shooter to shoot 50, 100 or 200 targets, depending upon the scheduled sub-event. Many of these shoots are for personal average or handicap yardage.<ref name = ATA2007/>\n\nATA rules specify that shotgun gauges larger than 12 gauge (such as 10 gauge) are not permissible.<ref name = ATA2007/> Maximum shot velocity is 1290 FPS (Feet Per Second) for shot charges up to 1 1/8 oz. and 1325 FPS for shot charges up to 1 oz.<ref name = ATA2007/>\n\nA variant of standard trap is Wobble or Wobble trap. The main difference is a more variable target flight path than in standard trap shooting because the trap machine oscillates up and down as well as side to side. Shooters are allowed two shots per pull, and shooters at stations 1 and 5 stand at the 18 yard (16.5 m) mark while positions 2\u20134 stand at the 17 yard (15.5 m) mark. Although this version of trap is not sanctioned by the ATA, many shooters consider it to be both more challenging and engaging as well as a more realistic preparation for bird hunting.\n\n===Other nationally and regionally recognized forms===\n[[Down-The-Line]] (DTL) is a form of trap popular in [[Great Britain]], [[Australia]], and [[South Africa]]. The trap machine oscillates left to right within a 45 degree arc and each competitor shoots in turn, then moves station after having attempted 5 targets from each station in each round of 25 targets. Two shots are permitted at each target, but second shots incur a points penalty. 3 points are awarded for each first-barrel hit, 2 points for a second-barrel hit, and 0 for a miss. A perfect score in a 100-target competition is written as 100/300. The points score, rather than the number of targets hit, determines the winner and is used to determine classifications (AA, A, B and C class).\n\nIn the [[Nordic countries]] and [[Great Britain]] (which is part of the [[Nordic Shooting Region]]), a form of trap formerly known as ''Hunter's trap'' and now as Nordic trap is popular. It is easier than the Olympic version.\n\n==Etiquette and practices==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2020}}{{original research|section|date=February 2020}}\nTrap etiquette is expected and practiced more fully during official and competitive events, but, to a lesser extent, also during informal shooting. American Trapshooting, more so than other shooting disciplines, including Olympic \"international\" trap, develops a certain rhythm to a squad timing between shots. The manners of any other squad member(s) can affect the performance of individuals within a squad. Most persons using a semi-automatic shotgun employ a shell catcher - an ejected hull hitting an adjacent shooter in the head or arm can certainly disrupt their concentration. Most shooters carry a few extra shells in case they drop one or have a misfire. Shooters usually avoid picking up any dropped shell, or other item, until after the 5th shooter has fired their 5th shot of the station and the squad is about to rotate to the next position, or sometimes until the end of the entire round. Idle chatting between shots, vulgar calls, and unnecessary movement can be generally disruptive. Additionally, where voice-activated throwing systems are in use, talking between shots may be detected by nearby microphones and prematurely launch targets during another shooter's turn. \n\nCommands from the scorer and other shooters are as important to squad timing as the behaviors of the shooters on the squad. To start a squad the shooter will ask if the squad and puller are ready (usually by calling \"Squad ready?\" then \"Puller ready?\"), followed by asking to see one free target, traditionally saying, \"Let's see one.\" Especially during official and competitive events the scorer will call missed targets with a command of: loss, lost, etc. When the first shooter has fired their final shot of the position the scorer will sometimes call \"end\" or \"ready\" and will command \"all change\" or \"please move\" after fifth shooter has fired their last shot. The shooter on position five then moves behind the rest of the shooters on their way to the first station and will signal when he is ready to the first shooter who is now on station two. The standard call for a target is \"pull,\" but many shooters like to use their own variations of \"pull,\" or words that will help them concentrate on the target; such as, \"yah\", a grunt is acceptable, some may even use a whistle or beeper.\n\n==Technique==\nThe technique for trap shooting is fundamentally different from rifle or pistol shooting. The latter shoots one projectile and aims to place accurately at a usually stationary target, and usually with at least a few seconds to aim. Trap shooting involves shooting hundreds of pellets at a time, at a target that is moving quickly downrange, and often quickly laterally, typically with less than a second to move the gun and fire. Instructors generally refer to the process as \"pointing\" the shotgun rather than aiming it.<ref name = \"little\">''The Little Trapshooting Book'' by Frank Little  Published by Further Adventures Inc.

There are a number of programs geared towards encouraging youth shooting.\n\nThe [[USA High School Clay Target League]] is the largest youth clay target shooting program in the world, with over 26,000 participants yearly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mnclaytarget.com/2018/04/04/nearly-12000-students-participate-mnshsctl-2018-spring-season/|title=NEARLY 12,000 STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN MNSHSCTL 2018 SPRING SEASON - Minnesota State High School Clay Target League|date=2018-04-04|work=Minnesota State High School Clay Target League|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}</ref> The USAHSCTL runs high-school trap shooting leagues in various states nationwide, the largest of which is Minnesota, where 12,000 students from nearly 450 schools compete.

The Minnesota State High School Clay Target League Championship is the largest trap shooting event in the world with over 8,000 student athletes participating in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/high-school-trap-shooting-is-going-over-with-a-bang-and-needs-more-help/485749961/|title=High School Trap Shooting is going over with a bang and needs more help|last1=Anderson|first1=Dennis|date=June 17, 2018|website=startribune.com|publisher=Star Tribune|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref> The League's motto is \"Safety, Fun, Marksmanship - In that order.\"\n\nThe [[Scholastic Clay Target Program]] (SCTP) is the second largest clay target program in the country, with just under 15,000 participants.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sssfonline.org/look-numbers-2017-scholastic-clay-target-program-sctp-scholastic-action-shooting-program-sasp-national-championships/|title=A look at the \u201cnumbers\u201d for the 2017 Scholastic Clay Target Program (SCTP) & Scholastic Action Shooting Program (SASP) National Championships - Scholastic Shooting Sports Foundation|date=2017-07-20|work=Scholastic Shooting Sports Foundation|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}</ref> SCTP promotes gun safety, personal responsibility, and sportsmanship among primary and secondary students. Teams compete at the local, state, and national level. Athletes are divided into four divisions based on academic grade level and experience: Rookie (fifth grade and below), Intermediate (sixth through eighth grades), Junior Varsity (ninth through twelfth grades), and Varsity (eleventh and twelfth grades with at least two years of experience at the Junior Varsity level). Trophies and college scholarships are awarded to third place, runner-up, and champion squads in each division at the SCTP National Championships, which are held concurrently with the first two days of the Grand American Trapshooting Championships in Sparta, Illinois.\n\nThe Amateur Trapshooting Association launched its youth program, AIM in October 2008. With about 3000 participants, the program, focusing on academics, integrity, and marksmanship, seeks to provide a safe and positive experience with firearms for youth, elementary through college age. AIM encourages good sportsmanship and personal responsibility through competition in order to make trap shooting a lifelong avocation. Categories and classes are designed to create a more level playing field and encourage genuine competition. Age based categories are established on the birthday of the shooter. Categories are Pre-Sub (11 and under), Sub-Junior (12\u201314), Junior (15\u201318) and Graduates/Collegiate (18\u201323). For purposes of determining age category the category declared by the participant on the first day he/she shoots shall be used. AIM Shooters have the opportunity to compete at local and State/Provincial levels as well as at the Grand American World Trapshooting Championships. The AIM Program offers the opportunity to compete in a unique sport that is heavily reliant on mental focus as well as enjoy the thrill and excitement of registered trap shooting.\n\nTo encourage young shooters, the ATA provides \"special categories\" for younger shooters who compete at ATA events. These categories include 'Junior' class for shooters who have not turned 18, and 'Sub-junior' for those not yet 15 as of the beginning of the ATA trap year (September 1). The ATA also allows shooters under the age of 18 to shoot for half-price at the Grand American as well as many other large ATA sponsored shoots. The ATA and state organizations such as the Texas Trapshooters' Association (TTA) award scholarships to college bound trap shooters based on citizenship, scholarship, and need. Numerous former TTA junior shooters are now attending college with the help of TTA and ATA scholarships.\n\nAdditionally, non-scholarship college teams are growing in popularity. Leading college trap teams{{whom|date=September 2019}} include those from [[Texas A&M University|Texas A & M]], [[Purdue University|Purdue]], [[Virginia Tech]], and [[Lindenwood University|Lindenwood (MO)]]. Teams from these schools dominate the [[Intercollegiate sports team champions#Trap & Skeet Shooting|U.S. intercollegiate trap championships]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Shotgun shooting sports]]\n", "name_user": "Skye.nel", "label": "safe", "comment": "inserted citation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_shooting"}
