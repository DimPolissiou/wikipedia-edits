The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|executive_producer = Lenny Duge\n|starring = See [[List of former Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) personnel|UWF alumni]]\n|country = United States\n|location = [[Reseda Country Club]] <small>(1990)</small><br>[[New York Penta]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Universal Studios Florida]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[War Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]] <small>(1990-1991)</small><br>[[Prime Ticket]] <small>(1992)</small><br>[[ESPN2]] <small>(1995)</small>\n|first_aired = October 1, 1990\n|last_aired = July 26, 1992\n|num_episodes = 69\n|list_episodes = List of UWF Fury Hour episodes\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year television deal with [[SportsChannel America]].

Trams departed from here towards Rajabazar, Howrah Station, Calcutta High Court, Dalhousie Square, Park Circus and [[Dharmatala]]. The first horse tram service of Kolkata was also started from Sealdah to Armenian Ghat, following the currently route 14 & 16 between Lebutala & Dalhousie Square. The Sealdah\u2013Lebutala & Dalhousie Square\u2013Armenian Ghat (later extended to High Court) stretch is now closed. That terminus was demolished in 1978 also with the Sealdah\u2013Lebutala tram track stretched through Boubazar Street for construction of the Sealdah flyover. Now tram services between Rajabazar\u2013Esplanade, Park Circus\u2013Burrabazar and other services pass through Sealdah. Currently, a car parking exists in place of the old tram terminus.\n\n==Operations==\n\n* There are three station terminals at Sealdah: '''Sealdah North''', '''Sealdah Main''' and '''Sealdah South'''. \n** The North section consists of Sealdah North and Sealdah Main buildings. It has 5 platforms in North and 9 platforms in main section, the platforms of North sections are 1, 2, 3, 4 & 4A\n** Sealdah main consists of platform no 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9C, 9B, 9A & 9D, one more platform is present beside platform no 9D which is used by only goods trains.\n** The South section consists of Sealdah South terminal, with 7 platforms 10A, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 & 14A.\nThe north and south sections have separate set of emerging tracks. The north and south section is connected by two links, one is Dumdum\u2013Majherhat link (popularly circular rail) and other is Bidhannagar Road\u2013Park Circus link (extension of circular rail). These two links were constructed to quickly travel between the two sections avoiding Sealdah.\n\nFor the financial department, there are DRM's, Sr.DFM's and ADFM's to look over. Sealdah North acts as the suburban train terminal for main division . The main division of Sealdah north operates trains plying between Kolkata and [[Hasnabad]], [[Bandel]], [[Gede railway station|Gede]], [[Ranaghat]], [[Shantipur]], [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanagar]], [[Berhampore, West Bengal|Berhampore]], [[Lalgola]], [[Dankuni]], [[Katwa]], [[Bardhaman]], [[Kanchrapara]], [[Barrackpore]], [[Kalyani, West Bengal|Kalyani, Kalyani Simanta]] and others. A narrow-gauge line earlier used to connect Shantipur and Krishnanagar but now it has been replaced with broad gauge. This narrow-gauge line further continued to [[Nabadwip Ghat]] and was served by DMU trains formerly<ref>{{cite web|title=Narrow Gauge in Nadia|url=https://www.irfca.org/gallery/Trips/east/shantipurNG/?g2_page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-08/kolkata/28141187_1_narrow-gauge-broad-gauge-railway-jobs |title = Mamata rolls out rly sops for Nadia | publisher= The Times of India, 8 January 2010 | accessdate = 2012-02-10 }}</ref> (all other lines run EMU trains). Now the suburban train service is also extended from Krishnanagar to [[Lalgola]],<ref>{{cite web|title=EMU Service starts upto Lalgola|url=http://www.millenniumpost.in/kolkata/er-introduces-additional-12-coach-emu-services-220315}}</ref> which part was previously served by electric loco-hauled trains only.

Naihati-Bandel (via [[Sampreeti Bridge]]) line connects Eastern Railway's [[Howrah\u2013Bardhaman main line|Howrah-Bardhaman main line]] at [[Bandel Junction railway station|Bandel Jn]].\n\nNow the poorly-patronized branch line between [[Dum Dum Cantonment railway station]] and Biman Bandar railway station ([[Dum Dum Airport]]) is closed and replaced by [[Kolkata Metro Line 4|Line 4]] (under construction) of the [[Kolkata Metro]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sevices End on Kolkata's Circular Railway|url=https://themetrorailguy.com/2016/10/13/services-end-on-kolkatas-circular-railway-to-facilitate-metros-construction/}}</ref>\n\nSealdah Main is the mail/express terminal for long distance trains to northern, north-western, north-eastern & eastern India, through Dankuni line and Bandel line. Krishnanagar line is also serving long distance intrastate trains.\n\nThe South section, consisting of Sealdah South terminal, acts as the terminal for local trains plying between Kolkata and [[Budge Budge]], [[Canning, South 24 Parganas|Canning]], [[Diamond Harbour]] and [[Namkhana]].\n\nThere is also an EMU carshed at Sealdah ([[Narkeldanga]]). Other EMU carsheds are at [[Barasat]] and [[Sonarpur]]. A diesel shunter loco shed is also situated at adjacent Beliaghata. A rail coach factory is set to come up at Halishahar-Kanchrapara (Bijpur) region in North 24 Parganas.\n\nBefore partition in 1947 of India, trains used to run up to present day [[Bangladesh]] along Gede line and Bangaon line. Now Gede line is used by [[Maitree Express]] up to [[Dhaka]] and Bangaon line is used by [[Bandhan Express]] up to [[Khulna]].\n\n== Lines ==\n\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Kalyani\u2013Kalyani Simanta\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Kalyani\u2013Ranaghat\u2013Taherpur\u2013Krishnanagar\u2013Berhampore\u2013Lalgola\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Kalyani\u2013Ranaghat\u2013Shantipur\u2013Krishnanagar\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Kalyani\u2013Ranaghat\u2013Gede\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Bandel\u2013Barddhaman\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Bandel\u2013Nabadwip Dham\u2013Katwa\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Barasat\u2013Bongaon\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Barasat\u2013Hasnabad\n* Sealdah\u2013Ballygunge\u2013Majherhat\u2013BBD Bag\u2013Kolkata\n* Sealdah\u2013Ballygunge\u2013Majherhat\u2013Budge Budge\n* Sealdah\u2013Ballygunge\u2013Sonarpur\u2013Canning\n* Sealdah\u2013Ballygunge\u2013Sonarpur\u2013Baruipur\u2013Diamond Harbour\n* Sealdah\u2013Ballygunge\u2013Sonarpur\u2013Baruipur\u2013Laxmikantapur\u2013Namkhana\n\n==Station Facilities==\n===Executive Lounge===\n[[IRCTC]] opened the first ''Executive Lounge'' at this station which is the first in any of the main stations in the state of West Bengal.

It also acts as an important suburban rail terminal. After completion, [[Kolkata Metro Line 2]] will pass through Sealdah.\n\n==History==\n\nSealdah railway station was started in 1869.<ref name=\"Sealdah History\">{{cite web|title=Sealdah History|url=http://www.irfca.org/~mrinal/sealdah.html|publisher=irfca.org/|accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Railway gazette international\">{{cite book|title=Railway gazette international|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unw7AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2012|year=1957|publisher=Reed Business Pub.|page=182}}</ref> Before 1978, there was a tram terminus at Sealdah station. Trams departed from here towards Rajabazar, Howrah Station, Calcutta High Court, Dalhousie Square, Park Circus and [[Dharmatala]]. The first horse tram service of Kolkata was also started from Sealdah to Armenian Ghat, following the currently route 14 & 16 between Lebutala & Dalhousie Square. The Sealdah\u2013Lebutala & Dalhousie Square\u2013Armenian Ghat (later extended to High Court) stretch is now closed. That terminus was demolished in 1978 also with the Sealdah\u2013Lebutala tram track stretched through Boubazar Street for construction of the Sealdah flyover. Now tram services between Rajabazar\u2013Esplanade, Park Circus\u2013Burrabazar and other services pass through Sealdah. Currently, a car parking exists in place of the old tram terminus.\n\n==Operations==\n\n* There are three station terminals at Sealdah: '''Sealdah North''', '''Sealdah Main''' and '''Sealdah South'''. \n** The North section consists of Sealdah North and Sealdah Main buildings. It has 5 platforms in North and 9 platforms in main section, the platforms of North sections are 1, 2, 3, 4 & 4A\n** Sealdah main consists of platform no 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9C, 9B, 9A & 9D, one more platform is present beside platform no 9D which is used by only goods trains.\n** The South section consists of Sealdah South terminal, with 7 platforms 10A, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 & 14A.\nThe north and south sections have separate set of emerging tracks. The north and south section is connected by two links, one is Dumdum\u2013Majherhat link (popularly circular rail) and other is Bidhannagar Road\u2013Park Circus link (extension of circular rail). These two links were constructed to quickly travel between the two sections avoiding Sealdah.\n\nFor the financial department, there are DRM's, Sr.DFM's and ADFM's to look over. Sealdah North acts as the suburban train terminal for main division . The main division of Sealdah north operates trains plying between Kolkata and [[Hasnabad]], [[Bandel]], [[Gede railway station|Gede]], [[Ranaghat]], [[Shantipur]], [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanagar]], [[Berhampore, West Bengal|Berhampore]], [[Lalgola]], [[Dankuni]], [[Katwa]], [[Bardhaman]], [[Kanchrapara]], [[Barrackpore]], [[Kalyani, West Bengal|Kalyani, Kalyani Simanta]] and others. A narrow-gauge line earlier used to connect Shantipur and Krishnanagar but now it has been replaced with broad gauge. This narrow-gauge line further continued to [[Nabadwip Ghat]] and was served by DMU trains formerly<ref>{{cite web|title=Narrow Gauge in Nadia|url=https://www.irfca.org/gallery/Trips/east/shantipurNG/?g2_page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-08/kolkata/28141187_1_narrow-gauge-broad-gauge-railway-jobs |title = Mamata rolls out rly sops for Nadia | publisher= The Times of India, 8 January 2010 | accessdate = 2012-02-10 }}</ref> (all other lines run EMU trains). Now the suburban train service is also extended from Krishnanagar to [[Lalgola]],<ref>{{cite web|title=EMU Service starts upto Lalgola|url=http://www.millenniumpost.in/kolkata/er-introduces-additional-12-coach-emu-services-220315}}</ref> which part was previously served by electric loco-hauled trains only.

Naihati-Bandel (via [[Sampreeti Bridge]]) line connects Eastern Railway's [[Howrah\u2013Bardhaman main line|Howrah-Bardhaman main line]] at [[Bandel Junction railway station|Bandel Jn]].\n\nNow the poorly-patronized branch line between [[Dum Dum Cantonment railway station]] and Biman Bandar railway station ([[Dum Dum Airport]]) is closed and replaced by [[Kolkata Metro Line 4|Line 4]] (under construction) of the [[Kolkata Metro]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sevices End on Kolkata's Circular Railway|url=https://themetrorailguy.com/2016/10/13/services-end-on-kolkatas-circular-railway-to-facilitate-metros-construction/}}</ref>\n\nSealdah Main is the mail/express terminal for long distance trains to northern, north-western, north-eastern & eastern India, through Dankuni line and Bandel line. Krishnanagar line is also serving long distance intrastate trains.\n\nThe South section, consisting of Sealdah South terminal, acts as the terminal for local trains plying between Kolkata and [[Budge Budge]], [[Canning, South 24 Parganas|Canning]], [[Diamond Harbour]] and [[Namkhana]].\n\nThere is also an EMU carshed at Sealdah ([[Narkeldanga]]). Other EMU carsheds are at [[Barasat]] and [[Sonarpur]]. A diesel shunter loco shed is also situated at adjacent Beliaghata. A rail coach factory is set to come up at Halishahar-Kanchrapara (Bijpur) region in North 24 Parganas.\n\nBefore partition in 1947 of India, trains used to run up to present day [[Bangladesh]] along Gede line and Bangaon line. Now Gede line is used by [[Maitree Express]] up to [[Dhaka]] and Bangaon line is used by [[Bandhan Express]] up to [[Khulna]].\n\n== Lines ==\n\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Kalyani\u2013Kalyani Simanta\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Kalyani\u2013Ranaghat\u2013Taherpur\u2013Krishnanagar\u2013Berhampore\u2013Lalgola\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Kalyani\u2013Ranaghat\u2013Shantipur\u2013Krishnanagar\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Kalyani\u2013Ranaghat\u2013Gede\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Bandel\u2013Barddhaman\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Naihati\u2013Bandel\u2013Nabadwip Dham\u2013Katwa\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Barasat\u2013Bongaon\n* Sealdah\u2013Dum Dum\u2013Barasat\u2013Hasnabad\n* Sealdah\u2013Ballygunge\u2013Majherhat\u2013BBD Bag\u2013Kolkata\n* Sealdah\u2013Ballygunge\u2013Majherhat\u2013Budge Budge\n* Sealdah\u2013Ballygunge\u2013Sonarpur\u2013Canning\n* Sealdah\u2013Ballygunge\u2013Sonarpur\u2013Baruipur\u2013Diamond Harbour\n* Sealdah\u2013Ballygunge\u2013Sonarpur\u2013Baruipur\u2013Laxmikantapur\u2013Namkhana\n\n==Station Facilities==\n===Executive Lounge===\n[[IRCTC]] opened the first ''Executive Lounge'' at this station which is the first in any of the main stations in the state of West Bengal.

ONE WILD RIDE!}}</ref> Pig, who is obsessed with pickles, Goat, who has musical dreams, Banana, who loves video games and Cricket, who is talented at mad science.<ref name=\"Andreeva 2013\" /> The four embark on surreal journeys on their own, which are then interwoven together; the action is set in Boopelite City, a gigantic and whirring metropolis where many of the buildings look like archaic clockworks. The streets are constantly teeming with characters of intensely varied description, and the sidewalks are crammed with anthropomorphic animals, robots, anthropomorphic foods, anthropomorphic sea creatures, and more. The four roommates live in a treehouse, which sits in the middle of the city, surrounded by the forest, the seas and anywhere else the friends could possibly go.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Pig (voiced by [[Matt L. Jones]]) \u2013 a dim-witted anthropomorphic [[pig]] who has a large liking for pickles. Pig is the \"fool\" of the group and causes most of their problems. Pig is hardly able to read by himself. He says his catchphrase \"that's my favorite!\", often when he sees something or someone he likes. His name may be short for Pignatius.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Pig Goat Banana Bricket |title=Let's Get Tiny |minutes=4}}<br>Pig \"I'm going to follow my dream and be the best blowhole in the history of blowholes, or my name isn't '''Pignatius Abalonea Plutonius''' the fourteenth.\"<br>Banana: (pauses after Pig screams and runs off) \"..That's not his name.\"</ref> Pig is resistant to what would normally be life-threatening injuries.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Zombie Broheims |series=PGBC |quote=Stomach spears, fun!}} (pulling spears out through his stomach after eating pickles stuffed full of spear-wielding munchkin warriors who impaled him afterward)</ref>\n* Goat (voiced by [[Candi Milo]]) \u2013 a sweet and cheerful anthropomorphic [[goat]] woman<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bananaland |series=PGBC |minutes=11}} Goat: \"I'm a one-woman band.\"</ref> who has been Pig's roommate for the past 29 years.<ref name=TwentyNine>{{cite episode |title=Bananaland |series=PGBC |minutes=18}} (Pig's segment) Pig: Who?<br>Goat: Goat. You know, your roommate for the past twenty nine years?<br>Pig: Oh, that Goat.</ref> She is the \"artist\" of the group being able to play the guitar and having a penchant for acting. Goat can be very easily irritated by others' antics and often displays anger, causing her to babble, speak [[gibberish]], and occasionally puff up her chest when angry (e.g. \"Flib flabbin' flibble flubbin!\"). Her catchphrase is \"Totally goatally\", which she says when she agrees with something. Goat has normal human-shaped ears (not goat-shaped) normally obscured underneath the locks of hair on the sides of her head. The horns on top of her head have holes in them.\n* Banana (voiced by [[Thomas F. Wilson]]) \u2013 a lazy, selfish anthropomorphic [[banana]] who enjoys playing video games. He has [[boy scouts]] for [[henchmen]]. Banana is the \"wise-guy\" of the group who loves to have fun and pull pranks. Banana is afraid of [[primates]] of all species, because they eat his kind. Banana tends to cry when put into pressure but quickly stops. He says his catchphrase \"Sweet mama's monkeys\" when he is surprised or shocked, and \"simpledy doo\" after finishing a task.\n* Cricket (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]) \u2013 an anthropomorphic [[cricket (insect)|cricket]] who is a genius inventor and speaks with a [[lisp]]. Cricket is the \"brains\" of the group. He is also the most responsible of the four and usually is forced to clean up their messes. Cricket has a [[Puppy love|crush]] on Goat, and while she has hugged him (and Banana/Pig simultaneously) and said she loves him, this can simply be behavior towards a [[friend zone|pal]]. He sometimes says \"Holy laser farts\", when he is surprised or shocked.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Burgerstein, Cricket's lab assistant (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]). He has a burger for a head and is made up of machines and other things. As his name implies, he is based on [[Frankenstein's Monster]]. He is called a \"burgerbrain\" by Cricket often, and Burgerstein grunts or babbles to express his intentions. In some episodes, Burgerstein temporarily becomes smart due to Cricket's inventions.\n* Goat's reflection (voiced by Milo) is see in many episodes as Goat looks in the mirror often for self-admiration or grooming. She is eventually revealed to be a distinct entity, and she and Goat get into an argument when TJ gives the reflection the 'Customer of the Day' award even though it was Goat who got him a souffl\u00e9.\n* [[Thomas Jefferson]] (later nicknamed TJ) debuts in \"The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts\" where he emerges from a nickel to battle Goat, and later saves the day by battling Lady Primavera. He later runs a smoothie caf\u00e9 in \"Zombie Broheims\" where he prevents Goat from being Customer of the Day because he swore to hate her forever. While discussing cookies she made, he calls [[Betsy Ross]] a [[hag]].\n* Sleazy Beave (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 a male [[beaver]] who debuted in \"Fudge-pocalypse\". Sleazy Beave is open to pretty much anything as he is nearly [[homeless]]. He was willingly about to get married to Delooney Hamshank (by the force of Ma Hamshank) but was then pranked by Pig who was wearing the wedding outfit. He appears to have a secondary [[superhero]] personality named The Masked Maniac as well.\n* Rasta Rat (voiced by Bennett) \u2013 Rasta Rat is a very laid-back [[rat]] who has [[dreadlocks]] and speaks in a [[Jamaican accent]]. He wears a green, red, and yellow [[beanie hat]]. A running gag is he constantly gets slammed onto the [[fourth wall]].\n* President of the Planet (voiced by [[James Adomian]]) \u2013 the [[dog]] who rules the entire planet. He can be a noble person when he wants to be, but can also be quite brute and honest in his [[opinions]], like when he told Goat that her superpower was complete garbage without a second thought in \"Super Space Meatball\".\n* Junior Rangers (voiced by [[Candi Milo]], [[Yuri Lowenthal]] and [[Maile Flanagan]]) \u2013 the Junior Rangers are the \"boy scout\" division of the Boopelite [[park rangers]]. They are a group of children varying in [[species]] who do various activities like real life Boy Scouts. They are watched over by Banana, who often lazes on the job. Some of the rangers do work for Banana that differs from normal activities, such as pranking the Hamshanks<ref>{{cite episode |title=Prank Thy Neighbor |series=PGBC}}</ref> or rescuing Banana from Big Ballah Koala.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Most Beautiful Roach in the World |series=PGBC}}</ref>\n**Barton<ref name=LGT>{{cite episode |title=Let's Get Tiny |series=PGBC |minutes=18}} \"I'm Barton\" .. \"I'm Tom\".</ref> is a rat.\n**Tom<ref name=LGT/> and Tabitha<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bananaland |series=PGBC |quote=Walk it off, Tabitha}}</ref> are [[alligator]]s or [[crocodile]]s.\n**an [[elephant]].\n* Ranger Rhino (voiced by Bennett) \u2013 a [[rhinoceros]] who is in charge of the Junior Rangers. He often tells off Banana for not doing his duty but still has a soft spot for him, such as in \"Wheelbarrow Full of Nachos\" he asks Banana to hang out with him.\n* Breakfast Burrito (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) \u2013 a very lazy [[burrito]]. For example, in \"The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts\", Banana simply asked him to put away a jar of [[peanut butter]], only for him to immediately sit on his couch and fall asleep.\n* Armpit Willy (voiced by DiMaggio) \u2013 an alligator who wears a [[beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]] and has thick, long armpit hairs.

The show follows the interwoven adventures of the titular quartet. It premiered on July 16, 2015, after the [[2015 Kids' Choice Sports Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/nickelodeon-pig-goat-banana-cricket-premiere-date-1201522587/|title=[WATCH] Nickelodeon's 'Pig Boat Banana Cricket': First Look At Animated Series \u2013 Variety|author=Reece Ristau|work=Variety|accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn June 25, 2015, Nickelodeon renewed ''Pig Goat Banana Cricket'' for a second season ahead of the series premiere.<ref name=\"seasontwo\">{{cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/candimilo/status/613760460605620224|title=Candi Milo on Twitter: \"Original record for the next season!! #NICKELODEON|publisher=Twitter.com}}</ref> The show's final episode aired in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n''Pig Goat Banana Cricket'' focuses on the titular quartet, a group of anthropomorphic best friends and roommates:<ref name=best/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ytv.com/shows/pig-goat-banana-cricket |title=Pig Goat Banana Cricket |website=YTV.com |quote=FOUR BEST FRIENDS. ONE WILD RIDE!}}</ref> Pig, who is obsessed with pickles, Goat, who has musical dreams, Banana, who loves video games and Cricket, who is talented at mad science.<ref name=\"Andreeva 2013\" /> The four embark on surreal journeys on their own, which are then interwoven together; the action is set in Boopelite City, a gigantic and whirring metropolis where many of the buildings look like archaic clockworks. The streets are constantly teeming with characters of intensely varied description, and the sidewalks are crammed with anthropomorphic animals, robots, anthropomorphic foods, anthropomorphic sea creatures, and more. The four roommates live in a treehouse, which sits in the middle of the city, surrounded by the forest, the seas and anywhere else the friends could possibly go.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Pig (voiced by [[Matt L. Jones]]) \u2013 a dim-witted anthropomorphic [[pig]] who has a large liking for pickles. Pig is the \"fool\" of the group and causes most of their problems. Pig is hardly able to read by himself. He says his catchphrase \"that's my favorite!\", often when he sees something or someone he likes. His name may be short for Pignatius.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Pig Goat Banana Bricket |title=Let's Get Tiny |minutes=4}}<br>Pig \"I'm going to follow my dream and be the best blowhole in the history of blowholes, or my name isn't '''Pignatius Abalonea Plutonius''' the fourteenth.\"<br>Banana: (pauses after Pig screams and runs off) \"..That's not his name.\"</ref> Pig is resistant to what would normally be life-threatening injuries.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Zombie Broheims |series=PGBC |quote=Stomach spears, fun!}} (pulling spears out through his stomach after eating pickles stuffed full of spear-wielding munchkin warriors who impaled him afterward)</ref>\n* Goat (voiced by [[Candi Milo]]) \u2013 a sweet and cheerful anthropomorphic [[goat]] woman<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bananaland |series=PGBC |minutes=11}} Goat: \"I'm a one-woman band.\"</ref> who has been Pig's roommate for the past 29 years.<ref name=TwentyNine>{{cite episode |title=Bananaland |series=PGBC |minutes=18}} (Pig's segment) Pig: Who?<br>Goat: Goat. You know, your roommate for the past twenty nine years?<br>Pig: Oh, that Goat.</ref> She is the \"artist\" of the group being able to play the guitar and having a penchant for acting. Goat can be very easily irritated by others' antics and often displays anger, causing her to babble, speak [[gibberish]], and occasionally puff up her chest when angry (e.g. \"Flib flabbin' flibble flubbin!\"). Her catchphrase is \"Totally goatally\", which she says when she agrees with something. Goat has normal human-shaped ears (not goat-shaped) normally obscured underneath the locks of hair on the sides of her head. The horns on top of her head have holes in them.\n* Banana (voiced by [[Thomas F. Wilson]]) \u2013 a lazy, selfish anthropomorphic [[banana]] who enjoys playing video games. He has [[boy scouts]] for [[henchmen]]. Banana is the \"wise-guy\" of the group who loves to have fun and pull pranks. Banana is afraid of [[primates]] of all species, because they eat his kind. Banana tends to cry when put into pressure but quickly stops. He says his catchphrase \"Sweet mama's monkeys\" when he is surprised or shocked, and \"simpledy doo\" after finishing a task.\n* Cricket (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]) \u2013 an anthropomorphic [[cricket (insect)|cricket]] who is a genius inventor and speaks with a [[lisp]]. Cricket is the \"brains\" of the group. He is also the most responsible of the four and usually is forced to clean up their messes. Cricket has a [[Puppy love|crush]] on Goat, and while she has hugged him (and Banana/Pig simultaneously) and said she loves him, this can simply be behavior towards a [[friend zone|pal]]. He sometimes says \"Holy laser farts\", when he is surprised or shocked.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Burgerstein, Cricket's lab assistant (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]). He has a burger for a head and is made up of machines and other things. As his name implies, he is based on [[Frankenstein's Monster]]. He is called a \"burgerbrain\" by Cricket often, and Burgerstein grunts or babbles to express his intentions. In some episodes, Burgerstein temporarily becomes smart due to Cricket's inventions.\n* Goat's reflection (voiced by Milo) is see in many episodes as Goat looks in the mirror often for self-admiration or grooming. She is eventually revealed to be a distinct entity, and she and Goat get into an argument when TJ gives the reflection the 'Customer of the Day' award even though it was Goat who got him a souffl\u00e9.\n* [[Thomas Jefferson]] (later nicknamed TJ) debuts in \"The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts\" where he emerges from a nickel to battle Goat, and later saves the day by battling Lady Primavera. He later runs a smoothie caf\u00e9 in \"Zombie Broheims\" where he prevents Goat from being Customer of the Day because he swore to hate her forever. While discussing cookies she made, he calls [[Betsy Ross]] a [[hag]].\n* Sleazy Beave (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 a male [[beaver]] who debuted in \"Fudge-pocalypse\". Sleazy Beave is open to pretty much anything as he is nearly [[homeless]]. He was willingly about to get married to Delooney Hamshank (by the force of Ma Hamshank) but was then pranked by Pig who was wearing the wedding outfit. He appears to have a secondary [[superhero]] personality named The Masked Maniac as well.\n* Rasta Rat (voiced by Bennett) \u2013 Rasta Rat is a very laid-back [[rat]] who has [[dreadlocks]] and speaks in a [[Jamaican accent]]. He wears a green, red, and yellow [[beanie hat]]. A running gag is he constantly gets slammed onto the [[fourth wall]].\n* President of the Planet (voiced by [[James Adomian]]) \u2013 the [[dog]] who rules the entire planet. He can be a noble person when he wants to be, but can also be quite brute and honest in his [[opinions]], like when he told Goat that her superpower was complete garbage without a second thought in \"Super Space Meatball\".\n* Junior Rangers (voiced by [[Candi Milo]], [[Yuri Lowenthal]] and [[Maile Flanagan]]) \u2013 the Junior Rangers are the \"boy scout\" division of the Boopelite [[park rangers]]. They are a group of children varying in [[species]] who do various activities like real life Boy Scouts. They are watched over by Banana, who often lazes on the job. Some of the rangers do work for Banana that differs from normal activities, such as pranking the Hamshanks<ref>{{cite episode |title=Prank Thy Neighbor |series=PGBC}}</ref> or rescuing Banana from Big Ballah Koala.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Most Beautiful Roach in the World |series=PGBC}}</ref>\n**Barton<ref name=LGT>{{cite episode |title=Let's Get Tiny |series=PGBC |minutes=18}} \"I'm Barton\" .. \"I'm Tom\".</ref> is a rat.\n**Tom<ref name=LGT/> and Tabitha<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bananaland |series=PGBC |quote=Walk it off, Tabitha}}</ref> are [[alligator]]s or [[crocodile]]s.\n**an [[elephant]].\n* Ranger Rhino (voiced by Bennett) \u2013 a [[rhinoceros]] who is in charge of the Junior Rangers. He often tells off Banana for not doing his duty but still has a soft spot for him, such as in \"Wheelbarrow Full of Nachos\" he asks Banana to hang out with him.\n* Breakfast Burrito (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) \u2013 a very lazy [[burrito]]. For example, in \"The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts\", Banana simply asked him to put away a jar of [[peanut butter]], only for him to immediately sit on his couch and fall asleep.\n* Armpit Willy (voiced by DiMaggio) \u2013 an alligator who wears a [[beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]] and has thick, long armpit hairs. His catchphrase is \"bushy bushy\".\n* Lady Primavera Van de Snuggles (voiced by [[Dyana Liu]]) debuts in \"The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts\" and returns in \"Gauntlet of Humiliation\", where she makes a cameo appearance by visiting Armpit Willy at his pool when Pig makes a fast food delivery to him.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Matt L.

Returning to his dorm room, he walks in on his roommate Carter and Carter\u2019s girlfriend, [[Tree Gelbman|Tree]]. He resumes work on an experimental quantum reactor with fellow students Samar and Dre. After Bronson, the school dean, shuts down the project for triggering several power outages, Ryan is murdered by someone dressed as Babyface and wakes up again on Tuesday the 19th. Tree explains her experience [[Happy Death Day#Plot|reliving Monday the 18th]], and she and Carter agree to help Ryan. They learn the reactor was responsible for creating the loop. The new Babyface tracks Ryan down, but Tree unmasks him to reveal another Ryan. The second Ryan warns that the original must die for the loop to close. Terrified, Ryan activates the reactor, releasing a powerful energy pulse that knocks everyone unconscious.\n\nTree wakes up in Carter's room on Monday the 18th, and relives her original time loop, but she soon realizes things are different after finding out that Carter is now dating a nicer Danielle. Ryan theorizes that the reactor caused Tree to drift into another dimension. When Tree learns her mother is still alive in this new reality, she decides to stay.\n\nThat night, Tree goes to the hospital to intercept serial killer John Tombs before he escapes but is confronted by a police officer. Babyface kills the officer, and Tree runs into Lori at the elevator, realizing she isn't the killer in this reality. Lori tells Tree that Babyface cannot be Tombs because she just took him in for surgery. Babyface stabs Lori, then chases Tree to the roof, where she accidentally falls to her death. She wakes at the beginning of her loop and demands that Ryan and his team help her escape it, requiring they test dozens of algorithms. At Carter's suggestion, Tree serves as the group's recorder, killing herself at the end of each day so they can start again. Eventually, her injuries catch up with her, and she faints. Waking up in the hospital, Tree steals a gun to go after Tombs, only to find Lori already dead. Tombs, disguised as Babyface, attacks, and Tree shoots him dead. However, a second Babyface appears, forcing Tree to kill herself and Babyface.\n\nThe group finally discovers the correct algorithm, but a technical issue forces a delay. Faced with a choice of which reality she wants to be in when both time loops close, Tree decides to remain in the current dimension. Carter urges Tree to consider the consequences of living a life that is not truly hers, and states that her experience with grief helped shape the person she is now. Tree hides from Babyface in a hotel. That evening, the news reports that Carter was murdered trying to save Lori at the hospital. Tree kills herself and deactivates the reactor so she can save Carter and Lori. The loop restarts and Tree decides to return to her own reality. She advises Lori to end her affair with her professor Dr. Butler, discovers that Danielle is cheating on Carter and has a final conversation with her mother.\n\nBronson confiscates the reactor before the group can activate it. Believing she is too weak to survive another loop, Tree insists they retrieve the device. The group enlists Danielle to distract Bronson while they recover the reactor. As Ryan readies the device, Tree goes to the hospital to rescue Lori from Tombs, but is trapped by the second Babyface\u2014revealed to be Dr. Butler trying to bury the evidence of his affair with Lori. Dr. Butler's wife Stephanie appears and shoots Lori, revealing she is in league with her husband, before he betrays and shoots her as well. Tree outsmarts Butler and kills him. Lori survives, and Tree and Carter kiss as the reactor activates, sending Tree back to her original dimension on Tuesday the 19th.\n\nLater, Tree, Carter, Ryan, Samar, and Dre are escorted by agents to a [[DARPA]] laboratory, where the reactor has been moved for further experimentation.

Returning to his dorm room, he walks in on his roommate Carter and Carter\u2019s girlfriend, [[Tree Gelbman|Tree]]. He resumes work on an experimental quantum reactor with fellow students Samar and Dre. After Bronson, the school dean, shuts down the project for triggering several power outages, Ryan is murdered by someone dressed as Babyface and wakes up again on Tuesday the 19th. Tree explains her experience [[Happy Death Day#Plot|reliving Monday the 18th]], and she and Carter agree to help Ryan. They learn the reactor was responsible for creating the loop. The new Babyface tracks Ryan down, but Tree unmasks him to reveal another Ryan. The second Ryan warns that the original must die for the loop to close. Terrified, Ryan activates the reactor, releasing a powerful energy pulse that knocks everyone unconscious.\n\nTree wakes up in Carter's room on Monday the 18th, and relives her original time loop, but she soon realizes things are different after finding out that Carter is now dating a nicer Danielle. Ryan theorizes that the reactor caused Tree to drift into another dimension. When Tree learns her mother is still alive in this new reality, she decides to stay.\n\nThat night, Tree goes to the hospital to intercept serial killer John Tombs before he escapes but is confronted by a police officer. Babyface kills the officer, and Tree runs into Lori at the elevator, realizing she isn't the killer in this reality. Lori tells Tree that Babyface cannot be Tombs because she just took him in for surgery. Babyface stabs Lori, then chases Tree to the roof, where she accidentally falls to her death. She wakes at the beginning of her loop and demands that Ryan and his team help her escape it, requiring they test dozens of algorithms. At Carter's suggestion, Tree serves as the group's recorder, killing herself at the end of each day so they can start again. Eventually, her injuries catch up with her, and she faints. Waking up in the hospital, Tree steals a gun to go after Tombs, only to find Lori already dead. Tombs, disguised as Babyface, attacks, and Tree shoots him dead. However, a second Babyface appears, forcing Tree to kill herself and Babyface.\n\nThe group finally discovers the correct algorithm, but a technical issue forces a delay. Faced with a choice of which reality she wants to be in when both time loops close, Tree decides to remain in the current dimension. Carter urges Tree to consider the consequences of living a life that is not truly hers, and states that her experience with grief helped shape the person she is now. Tree hides from Babyface in a hotel. That evening, the news reports that Carter was murdered trying to save Lori at the hospital. Tree kills herself and deactivates the reactor so she can save Carter and Lori. The loop restarts and Tree decides to return to her own reality. She advises Lori to end her affair with her professor Dr. Butler, discovers that Danielle is cheating on Carter and has a final conversation with her mother.\n\nBronson confiscates the reactor before the group can activate it. Believing she is too weak to survive another loop, Tree insists they retrieve the device. The group enlists Danielle to distract Bronson while they recover the reactor. As Ryan readies the device, Tree goes to the hospital to rescue Lori from Tombs, but is trapped by the second Babyface\u2014revealed to be Dr. Butler trying to bury the evidence of his affair with Lori. Dr. Butler's wife Stephanie appears and shoots Lori, revealing she is in league with her husband, before he betrays and shoots her as well. Tree outsmarts Butler and kills him. Lori survives, and Tree and Carter kiss as the reactor activates, sending Tree back to her original dimension on Tuesday the 19th.\n\nLater, Tree, Carter, Ryan, Samar, and Dre are escorted by agents to a [[DARPA]] laboratory, where the reactor has been moved for further experimentation. When the agents say they need a test subject in order to see how the machine works, Tree says she knows the perfect test subject. In her bedroom, Danielle wakes up, screaming in horror.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jessica Rothe]] as [[Tree Gelbman]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3496547/first-happy-death-day-2-casting-announced-jessica-rothe-returns-tree/ |title=First 'Happy Death Day 2' Casting Announced; Jessica Rothe Returns as Tree! |last=Squires |first=John |date=May 1, 2018 |access-date=June 28, 2018 |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612144358/https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3496547/first-happy-death-day-2-casting-announced-jessica-rothe-returns-tree/# |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Israel Broussard]] as Carter Davis<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comingsoon.net/movies/news/942519-jessica-rothe-israel-broussard-return-happy-death-day-2 |title=Jessica Rothe and Israel Broussard Return for Happy Death Day 2 |last=Hemmert |first=Kylie |date=May 1, 2018 |access-date=June 28, 2018 |work=[[ComingSoon.net]] |publisher=Evolve Media, LLC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233636/https://comingsoon.net/movies/news/942519-jessica-rothe-israel-broussard-return-happy-death-day-2# |archive-date=June 28, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Suraj Sharma]] as Samar Ghosh<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/05/happy-death-day-2-casting-jessica-rothe-israel-broussard-suraj-sharma-sarah-yarkin-1202380281/ |title='Happy Death Day 2': Jessica Rothe, Israel Broussard Return; Suraj Sharma & Sarah Yarkin Joining Blumhouse Sequel |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |date=May 1, 2018 |access-date=June 28, 2018 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC.]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711113004/https://deadline.com/2018/05/happy-death-day-2-casting-jessica-rothe-israel-broussard-suraj-sharma-sarah-yarkin-1202380281/# |archive-date=July 11, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Steve Zissis]] as Dean Bronson\n* [[Ruby Modine]] as Lori Spengler<ref>{{cite journal |last=McNary |first=Dave |title=Film News Roundup: Ruby Modine Returns for 'Happy Death Day 2' (EXCLUSIVE) |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/ruby-modine-returns-happy-death-day-2-1202796397/ |date=May 2, 2018 |access-date=June 28, 2018 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC.]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612233654/https://variety.com/2018/film/news/ruby-modine-returns-happy-death-day-2-1202796397/# |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* Phi Vu as Ryan Phan\n* Sarah Yarkin as Dre Morgan<ref>{{cite book |last=Baxter |first=Joseph |title=Happy Death Day 2 Reveals Cast and Production Date |url=https://denofgeek.com/us/movies/happy-death-day-2/271775/happy-death-day-2-reveals-cast-and-production-date |date=May 1, 2018 |access-date=June 28, 2018 |work=[[Den of Geek]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629023659/https://denofgeek.com/us/movies/happy-death-day-2/271775/happy-death-day-2-reveals-cast-and-production-date# |archive-date=June 29, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Rachel Matthews]] as Danielle Bouseman<ref>{{cite tweet |user=jessica_rothe |number=998705874645409792 |first=Jessica |last=Rothe |title=Come be in HAPPY DEATH DAY 2 with me and the rest of the wonderful cast!

The [[half reaction]], balanced with acid, is:\n\n:Reduction at cathode: 2 H<sup>+</sup>(''[[Aqueous solution|aq]]'') + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>(''[[gaseous|g]]'')\n\nAt the positively charged anode, an [[redox|oxidation]] reaction occurs, generating oxygen gas and giving electrons to the anode to complete the circuit:\n\n:Oxidation at anode: 2 H<sub>2</sub>O(''[[liquid|l]]'') \u2192 O<sub>2</sub>(''g'') + 4 H<sup>+</sup>(''aq'') + 4e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nThe same half-reactions can also be balanced with the base as listed below. Not all half-reactions must be balanced with acid or base. Many do, like the oxidation or reduction of water listed here. To add half reactions they must both be balanced with either acid or base. The acid-balanced reactions predominate in acidic (low pH) solutions, while the base-balanced reactions predominate in basic (high pH) solutions.\n\n{|\n|Cathode (reduction):\n|2 H<sub>2</sub>O(''l'') + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|\u2192\n|H<sub>2</sub>(''g'') + 2 OH<sup>\u2212</sup>(''aq'')\n|-\n|Anode (oxidation):\n|2 OH<sup>\u2212</sup>(''aq'')\n|\u2192 \n|1/2 O<sub>2</sub>(''g'') +  H<sub>2</sub>O(''l'') + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|}\nCombining either half reaction pair yields the same overall decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen:\n\n:Overall reaction: 2 H<sub>2</sub>O(''l'') \u2192 2 H<sub>2</sub>(''g'') + O<sub>2</sub>(''g'')\n\nThe number of hydrogen molecules produced is thus twice the number of oxygen molecules. Assuming equal temperature and pressure for both gases, the produced hydrogen gas has, therefore, twice the volume of the produced oxygen gas. The number of electrons pushed through the water is twice the number of generated hydrogen molecules and four times the number of generated oxygen molecules.\n\n==Thermodynamics==\n\n[[File:PourbaixWater.png|thumb|300px|right | [[Pourbaix diagram]] for water, including equilibrium regions for water, oxygen and hydrogen at STP. The vertical scale is the electrode potential of hydrogen or non-interacting electrode relative to an [[Standard hydrogen electrode|SHE]] electrode, the horizontal scale is the [[pH]] of the electrolyte (otherwise non-interacting). Neglecting [[overpotential]], above the top line the equilibrium condition is oxygen gas, and oxygen will bubble off of the electrode until equilibrium is reached. Likewise, below the bottom line, the equilibrium condition is hydrogen gas, and hydrogen will bubble off of the electrode until equilibrium is reached. ]]\n\nThe decomposition of pure water into hydrogen and oxygen at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is not favorable in [[thermochemistry|thermodynamic]] terms.\n\n{|\n|Anode (oxidation):\n|2 H<sub>2</sub>O(''l'')\n|\u2192 \n|O<sub>2</sub>(''g'') + 4 H<sup>+</sup>(''aq'') + 4e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|E<sup>o</sup> = +1.23 V (for the reduction half-equation)<ref>[[standard electrode potential (data page)]]</ref>\n|-\n|Cathode (reduction):\n|2 H<sup>+</sup>(''aq'') + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|\u2192\n|H<sub>2</sub>(''g'')\n|\n|E<sup>o</sup> = 0.00 V\n|}\n\nThus, the standard potential of the water electrolysis cell (E<sup>o</sup><sub>cell</sub> = E<sup>o</sup><sub>cathode</sub> \u2212 E<sup>o</sup><sub>anode</sub>) is \u22121.23 V at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C at pH 0 ([H<sup>+</sup>] = 1.0 M). At 25&nbsp;\u00b0C with pH 7 ([H<sup>+</sup>] = 1.0{{e|\u22127}} M), the potential is unchanged based on the [[Nernst equation]].  The thermodynamic standard cell potential can be obtained from standard-state free energy calculations to find \u0394G\u00b0 and then using the equation: \u0394G\u00b0= -nFE\u00b0(where E\u00b0 is the cell potential). In practice when an electrochemical cell is \"driven\" toward completion by applying reasonable potential, it is kinetically controlled. Therefore, activation energy, ion mobility (diffusion) and concentration, wire resistance, surface hindrance including bubble formation (causes electrode area blockage), and entropy, require a greater applied potential to overcome these factors. The amount of increase in potential required is termed the [[overpotential]].\n\n==Electrolyte selection==\n[[Image:Elektrolyse1.jpg|thumb|[[Hoffman voltameter]] connected to a [[direct current]] [[Switched-mode power supply|power supply]]]]\nIf the above described processes occur in pure water, H<sup>+</sup> [[cation]]s will be consumed/reduced at the cathode and OH<sup>\u2212</sup> [[anion]]s will be consumed/oxidised at the anode. This can be verified by adding a [[pH indicator]] to the water: the water near the cathode is basic while the water near the anode is acidic.  The negative hydroxide ions that approach the anode mostly combine with the positive hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) to form water.  The positive hydronium ions that approach the cathode mostly combine with negative hydroxide ions to form water.  Relatively few hydroniums/hydroxide ions reach the cathode/anode.  This can cause a concentration overpotential at both electrodes.\n\nPure water is a fairly good insulator since it has a low [[Self-ionization of water|autoionization]], K<sub>w</sub> = 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u221214</sup> at room temperature and thus pure water conducts current poorly, 0.055 \u00b5S\u00b7cm<sup>\u22121</sup>.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Light|first=Truman S.|last2=Licht|first2=Stuart|last3=Bevilacqua|first3=Anthony C.|last4=Morash|first4=Kenneth R.|date=1 January 2005|title=The Fundamental Conductivity and Resistivity of Water|journal=Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters|volume=8|issue=1|pages=E16\u2013E19|doi=10.1149/1.1836121|issn=1099-0062|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3669cfc9e592525ed60b98a254cfd1544bd1b1ce}}</ref>  Unless a very large potential is applied to cause an increase in the autoionization of water the electrolysis of pure water proceeds very slowly limited by the overall conductivity.\n\nIf a water-soluble electrolyte is added, the conductivity of the water rises considerably. The electrolyte disassociates into [[cation]]s and anions; the anions rush towards the anode and neutralize the buildup of positively charged H<sup>+</sup> there; similarly, the cations rush towards the cathode and neutralize the buildup of negatively charged OH<sup>\u2212</sup> there. This allows the continuous flow of electricity.<ref>[[Linus Pauling|Pauling, Linus]] (1970) ''General Chemistry'', Section 15-2. San Francisco.</ref>\n\n=== Electrolyte for water electrolysis ===\nCare must be taken in choosing an electrolyte since an anion from the electrolyte competes with the hydroxide ions to give up an [[electron]]. An electrolyte anion with less [[standard electrode potential]] than hydroxide will be oxidized instead of the hydroxide, and no oxygen gas will be produced. A [[cation]] with a greater [[standard electrode potential]] than a hydrogen ion will be reduced instead, and no hydrogen gas will be produced.\n\nThe following [[cations]] have lower [[Standard electrode potential|electrode potential]] than H<sup>+</sup> and are therefore suitable for use as electrolyte cations: [[Lithium|Li]]<sup>+</sup>, [[Rubidium|Rb]]<sup>+</sup>, [[Potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[Caesium|Cs]]<sup>+</sup>, [[Barium|Ba]]<sup>2+</sup>, [[Strontium|Sr]]<sup>2+</sup>, [[Calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>, [[Sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, and [[Magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>. [[Sodium]] and [[lithium]] are frequently used, as they form inexpensive, soluble salts.\n\nIf an [[acid]] is used as the electrolyte, the cation is H<sup>+</sup>, and there is no competitor for the H<sup>+</sup> created by disassociating water. The most commonly used anion is [[sulfate]] ({{chem|SO|4|2-}}), as it is very difficult to oxidize, with the standard potential for oxidation of this ion to the [[peroxydisulfate]] ion being +2.010 volts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=CRC handbook of chemistry and physics : a ready-reference book of chemical and physical data.|date=2012|publisher=CRC|others=Haynes, William M.|isbn=9781439880494|edition=93rd ed., 2012-2013|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|oclc=793213751}}</ref><!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP-->\n\nStrong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), and strong bases such as [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH), and [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) are frequently used as electrolytes due to their strong conducting abilities.\n\nA solid polymer electrolyte can also be used such as [[Nafion]] and when applied with a special catalyst on each side of the membrane can efficiently split the water molecule with as little as 1.5&nbsp; volts.

When the gap distance between cathode and anode even smaller than [[Debye length|Debye-length]] (1 micron in pure water, around 220&nbsp;nm in distilled water), the [[Double layer (surface science)|double layer]] regions from two electrodes can overlap with each other, leading to uniformly high electric field distributed inside the entire gap. Such a high electric field can significantly enhance the ion transport inside the water (mainly due to migration), further enhancing [[self-ionization of water]] and keeping the whole reaction continuing, and showing small resistance between the two electrodes. In this case, the two [[half-reaction]]s are coupled together and limited by electron-transfer steps (electrolysis current saturated when further reducing the electrode distance).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yifei|last2=Narayanan|first2=S.

Using NaCl (table salt) in an electrolyte solution results in [[chlorine]] gas rather than oxygen due to a [[Electrolysis#Competing half-reactions in solution electrolysis|competing half-reaction]]. With the correct electrodes and correct electrolyte, such as baking soda ([[sodium bicarbonate]]), hydrogen and oxygen gases will stream from the oppositely charged [[electrode]]s. Oxygen will collect at the positively charged electrode ([[anode]]) and hydrogen will collect at the negatively charged electrode ([[cathode]]). Note that hydrogen is positively charged in the H<sub>2</sub>O molecule, so it ends up at the negative electrode. (And vice versa for oxygen.)\n\nNote that an aqueous solution of water with chloride ions, when electrolyzed, will result in either OH<sup>\u2212</sup> if the concentration of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> is low, or in chlorine gas being preferentially discharged if the concentration of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> is greater than 25% by mass in the solution.\n\n[[Image:Elektrolyse2.jpg|thumb|Match test used to detect the presence of hydrogen gas]]\n\n===Hofmann voltameter===\n{{Main|Hofmann voltameter}}\n\nThe Hofmann voltameter is often used as a small-scale electrolytic cell. It consists of three joined upright cylinders. The inner cylinder is open at the top to allow the addition of water and the electrolyte. A [[platinum]] electrode is placed at the bottom of each of the two side cylinders, connected to the positive and negative terminals of a source of [[electricity]]. When current is run through the Hofmann voltameter, gaseous oxygen forms at the [[anode]] (positive) and gaseous hydrogen at the [[cathode]] (negative). Each gas displaces water and collects at the top of the two outer tubes, where it can be drawn off with a stopcock.\n\n=== Industrial ===\nMany industrial electrolysis cells are very similar to [[Hofmann voltameter]]s, with complex platinum plates or honeycombs as electrodes. Generally, the only time hydrogen is intentionally produced from electrolysis is for the specific point of use application such as is the case with [[oxyhydrogen]] torches or when extremely [[hydrogen purity|high purity hydrogen]] or oxygen is desired. The vast majority of hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbons and as a result, contains trace amounts of [[carbon monoxide]] among other impurities.

In nanogap electrochemical cells,  the two electrodes are so close to each other (even smaller than [[Debye length|Debye-length]] in pure water) that the mass transport rate can be even higher than the electron-transfer rate, leading to two [[half-reaction]]s coupled together and limited by electron-transfer step. Experiments show that the electrical current density from pure water electrolysis can be even larger than that from 1&nbsp; mol/L sodium hydroxide solution. The mechanism, \"Virtual Breakdown Mechanism\", is completely different from the well-established traditional electrochemical theory, due to such nanogap size effect.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Applications==\n\nAbout five percent of hydrogen gas produced worldwide is created by electrolysis. Currently, most industrial methods produce hydrogen from [[natural gas]] instead, in the [[steam reforming]] process.   The majority of the hydrogen produced through electrolysis is a side product in the production of [[chlorine#Production|chlorine]] and [[caustic soda]]. This is a prime example of a [[electrolysis#Competing for half-reactions in solution electrolysis|competing for side reaction]].\n\n:2NaCl + 2H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> + 2NaOH\n\nIn the [[chloralkali process]] (electrolysis of brine) a water/sodium chloride mixture is only half the electrolysis of water since the [[chloride]] ions are oxidized to [[chlorine]] rather than water being oxidized to oxygen. Thermodynamically, this would not be expected since the oxidation potential of the chloride ion is less than that of water, but the rate of the chloride reaction is much greater than that of water, causing it to predominate.  The hydrogen produced from this process is either burned (converting it back to water), used for the production of [[specialty chemicals]], or various other small-scale applications.\n\nWater electrolysis is also used to generate oxygen for the [[International Space Station]].<ref name=asme>{{cite web| title=Making Space Safer with Electrolysis| url=http://www.asme.org/kb/news---articles/articles/aerospace---defense/making-space-safer-with-electrolysis| publisher=[[ASME]]| accessdate=26 May 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515233531/http://www.asme.org/kb/news---articles/articles/aerospace---defense/making-space-safer-with-electrolysis| archive-date=15 May 2012| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=nasa>{{cite web| title=Breathing Easy on the Space Station| url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast13nov_1/| publisher=NASA Science| accessdate=26 May 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519020228/http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast13nov_1/| archive-date=19 May 2012| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHydrogen may later be used in a [[fuel cell]] as a storage method of energy and water.<ref name=storage>{{cite web|title=Solar Hydrogen Fuel Cell Water Heater (Educational Stand)|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/34346401/Solar-Hydrogen-Fuel-Cell-Water-Heater-Educational-Stand|via=[[Scribd]]|access-date=9 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808184750/https://www.scribd.com/doc/34346401/Solar-Hydrogen-Fuel-Cell-Water-Heater-Educational-Stand|archive-date=8 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Efficiency==\n\n=== Industrial output ===\nEfficiency of modern hydrogen generators is measured by ''energy consumed per standard volume of hydrogen'' (MJ/m<sup>3</sup>), assuming [[standard temperature and pressure]] of the H<sub>2</sub>.

The [[half reaction]], balanced with acid, is:\n\n:Reduction at cathode: 2 H<sup>+</sup>(''[[Aqueous solution|aq]]'') + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>(''[[gaseous|g]]'')\n\nAt the positively charged anode, an [[redox|oxidation]] reaction occurs, generating oxygen gas and giving electrons to the anode to complete the circuit:\n\n:Oxidation at anode: 2 H<sub>2</sub>O(''[[liquid|l]]'') \u2192 O<sub>2</sub>(''g'') + 4 H<sup>+</sup>(''aq'') + 4e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nThe same half-reactions can also be balanced with the base as listed below. Not all half-reactions must be balanced with acid or base. Many do, like the oxidation or reduction of water listed here. To add half reactions they must both be balanced with either acid or base. The acid-balanced reactions predominate in acidic (low pH) solutions, while the base-balanced reactions predominate in basic (high pH) solutions.\n\n{|\n|Cathode (reduction):\n|2 H<sub>2</sub>O(''l'') + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|\u2192\n|H<sub>2</sub>(''g'') + 2 OH<sup>\u2212</sup>(''aq'')\n|-\n|Anode (oxidation):\n|2 OH<sup>\u2212</sup>(''aq'')\n|\u2192 \n|1/2 O<sub>2</sub>(''g'') +  H<sub>2</sub>O(''l'') + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|}\nCombining either half reaction pair yields the same overall decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen:\n\n:Overall reaction: 2 H<sub>2</sub>O(''l'') \u2192 2 H<sub>2</sub>(''g'') + O<sub>2</sub>(''g'')\n\nThe number of hydrogen molecules produced is thus twice the number of oxygen molecules. Assuming equal temperature and pressure for both gases, the produced hydrogen gas has, therefore, twice the volume of the produced oxygen gas. The number of electrons pushed through the water is twice the number of generated hydrogen molecules and four times the number of generated oxygen molecules.\n\n==Thermodynamics==\n\n[[File:PourbaixWater.png|thumb|300px|right | [[Pourbaix diagram]] for water, including equilibrium regions for water, oxygen and hydrogen at STP. The vertical scale is the electrode potential of hydrogen or non-interacting electrode relative to an [[Standard hydrogen electrode|SHE]] electrode, the horizontal scale is the [[pH]] of the electrolyte (otherwise non-interacting). Neglecting [[overpotential]], above the top line the equilibrium condition is oxygen gas, and oxygen will bubble off of the electrode until equilibrium is reached. Likewise, below the bottom line, the equilibrium condition is hydrogen gas, and hydrogen will bubble off of the electrode until equilibrium is reached. ]]\n\nThe decomposition of pure water into hydrogen and oxygen at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is not favorable in [[thermochemistry|thermodynamic]] terms.\n\n{|\n|Anode (oxidation):\n|2 H<sub>2</sub>O(''l'')\n|\u2192 \n|O<sub>2</sub>(''g'') + 4 H<sup>+</sup>(''aq'') + 4e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|E<sup>o</sup> = +1.23 V (for the reduction half-equation)<ref>[[standard electrode potential (data page)]]</ref>\n|-\n|Cathode (reduction):\n|2 H<sup>+</sup>(''aq'') + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|\u2192\n|H<sub>2</sub>(''g'')\n|\n|E<sup>o</sup> = 0.00 V\n|}\n\nThus, the standard potential of the water electrolysis cell (E<sup>o</sup><sub>cell</sub> = E<sup>o</sup><sub>cathode</sub> \u2212 E<sup>o</sup><sub>anode</sub>) is \u22121.23 V at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C at pH 0 ([H<sup>+</sup>] = 1.0 M). At 25&nbsp;\u00b0C with pH 7 ([H<sup>+</sup>] = 1.0{{e|\u22127}} M), the potential is unchanged based on the [[Nernst equation]].  The thermodynamic standard cell potential can be obtained from standard-state free energy calculations to find \u0394G\u00b0 and then using the equation: \u0394G\u00b0= -nFE\u00b0(where E\u00b0 is the cell potential). In practice when an electrochemical cell is \"driven\" toward completion by applying reasonable potential, it is kinetically controlled. Therefore, activation energy, ion mobility (diffusion) and concentration, wire resistance, surface hindrance including bubble formation (causes electrode area blockage), and entropy, require a greater applied potential to overcome these factors. The amount of increase in potential required is termed the [[overpotential]].\n\n==Electrolyte selection==\n[[Image:Elektrolyse1.jpg|thumb|[[Hoffman voltameter]] connected to a [[direct current]] [[Switched-mode power supply|power supply]]]]\nIf the above described processes occur in pure water, H<sup>+</sup> [[cation]]s will be consumed/reduced at the cathode and OH<sup>\u2212</sup> [[anion]]s will be consumed/oxidised at the anode. This can be verified by adding a [[pH indicator]] to the water: the water near the cathode is basic while the water near the anode is acidic.  The negative hydroxide ions that approach the anode mostly combine with the positive hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) to form water.  The positive hydronium ions that approach the cathode mostly combine with negative hydroxide ions to form water.  Relatively few hydroniums/hydroxide ions reach the cathode/anode.  This can cause a concentration overpotential at both electrodes.\n\nPure water is a fairly good insulator since it has a low [[Self-ionization of water|autoionization]], K<sub>w</sub> = 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u221214</sup> at room temperature and thus pure water conducts current poorly, 0.055 \u00b5S\u00b7cm<sup>\u22121</sup>.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Light|first=Truman S.|last2=Licht|first2=Stuart|last3=Bevilacqua|first3=Anthony C.|last4=Morash|first4=Kenneth R.|date=1 January 2005|title=The Fundamental Conductivity and Resistivity of Water|journal=Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters|volume=8|issue=1|pages=E16\u2013E19|doi=10.1149/1.1836121|issn=1099-0062|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3669cfc9e592525ed60b98a254cfd1544bd1b1ce}}</ref>  Unless a very large potential is applied to cause an increase in the autoionization of water the electrolysis of pure water proceeds very slowly limited by the overall conductivity.\n\nIf a water-soluble electrolyte is added, the conductivity of the water rises considerably. The electrolyte disassociates into [[cation]]s and anions; the anions rush towards the anode and neutralize the buildup of positively charged H<sup>+</sup> there; similarly, the cations rush towards the cathode and neutralize the buildup of negatively charged OH<sup>\u2212</sup> there. This allows the continuous flow of electricity.<ref>[[Linus Pauling|Pauling, Linus]] (1970) ''General Chemistry'', Section 15-2. San Francisco.</ref>\n\n=== Electrolyte for water electrolysis ===\nCare must be taken in choosing an electrolyte since an anion from the electrolyte competes with the hydroxide ions to give up an [[electron]]. An electrolyte anion with less [[standard electrode potential]] than hydroxide will be oxidized instead of the hydroxide, and no oxygen gas will be produced. A [[cation]] with a greater [[standard electrode potential]] than a hydrogen ion will be reduced instead, and no hydrogen gas will be produced.\n\nThe following [[cations]] have lower [[Standard electrode potential|electrode potential]] than H<sup>+</sup> and are therefore suitable for use as electrolyte cations: [[Lithium|Li]]<sup>+</sup>, [[Rubidium|Rb]]<sup>+</sup>, [[Potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[Caesium|Cs]]<sup>+</sup>, [[Barium|Ba]]<sup>2+</sup>, [[Strontium|Sr]]<sup>2+</sup>, [[Calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>, [[Sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, and [[Magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>. [[Sodium]] and [[lithium]] are frequently used, as they form inexpensive, soluble salts.\n\nIf an [[acid]] is used as the electrolyte, the cation is H<sup>+</sup>, and there is no competitor for the H<sup>+</sup> created by disassociating water. The most commonly used anion is [[sulfate]] ({{chem|SO|4|2-}}), as it is very difficult to oxidize, with the standard potential for oxidation of this ion to the [[peroxydisulfate]] ion being +2.010 volts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=CRC handbook of chemistry and physics : a ready-reference book of chemical and physical data.|date=2012|publisher=CRC|others=Haynes, William M.|isbn=9781439880494|edition=93rd ed., 2012-2013|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|oclc=793213751}}</ref><!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP-->\n\nStrong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), and strong bases such as [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH), and [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) are frequently used as electrolytes due to their strong conducting abilities.\n\nA solid polymer electrolyte can also be used such as [[Nafion]] and when applied with a special catalyst on each side of the membrane can efficiently split the water molecule with as little as 1.5&nbsp; volts.

When the gap distance between cathode and anode even smaller than [[Debye length|Debye-length]] (1 micron in pure water, around 220&nbsp;nm in distilled water), the [[Double layer (surface science)|double layer]] regions from two electrodes can overlap with each other, leading to uniformly high electric field distributed inside the entire gap. Such a high electric field can significantly enhance the ion transport inside the water (mainly due to migration), further enhancing [[self-ionization of water]] and keeping the whole reaction continuing, and showing small resistance between the two electrodes. In this case, the two [[half-reaction]]s are coupled together and limited by electron-transfer steps (electrolysis current saturated when further reducing the electrode distance).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yifei|last2=Narayanan|first2=S.

Using NaCl (table salt) in an electrolyte solution results in [[chlorine]] gas rather than oxygen due to a [[Electrolysis#Competing half-reactions in solution electrolysis|competing half-reaction]]. With the correct electrodes and correct electrolyte, such as baking soda ([[sodium bicarbonate]]), hydrogen and oxygen gases will stream from the oppositely charged [[electrode]]s. Oxygen will collect at the positively charged electrode ([[anode]]) and hydrogen will collect at the negatively charged electrode ([[cathode]]). Note that hydrogen is positively charged in the H<sub>2</sub>O molecule, so it ends up at the negative electrode. (And vice versa for oxygen.)\n\nNote that an aqueous solution of water with chloride ions, when electrolyzed, will result in either OH<sup>\u2212</sup> if the concentration of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> is low, or in chlorine gas being preferentially discharged if the concentration of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> is greater than 25% by mass in the solution.\n\n[[Image:Elektrolyse2.jpg|thumb|Match test used to detect the presence of hydrogen gas]]\n\n===Hofmann voltameter===\n{{Main|Hofmann voltameter}}\n\nThe Hofmann voltameter is often used as a small-scale electrolytic cell. It consists of three joined upright cylinders. The inner cylinder is open at the top to allow the addition of water and the electrolyte. A [[platinum]] electrode is placed at the bottom of each of the two side cylinders, connected to the positive and negative terminals of a source of [[electricity]]. When current is run through the Hofmann voltameter, gaseous oxygen forms at the [[anode]] (positive) and gaseous hydrogen at the [[cathode]] (negative). Each gas displaces water and collects at the top of the two outer tubes, where it can be drawn off with a stopcock.\n\n=== Industrial ===\nMany industrial electrolysis cells are very similar to [[Hofmann voltameter]]s, with complex platinum plates or honeycombs as electrodes. Generally, the only time hydrogen is intentionally produced from electrolysis is for the specific point of use application such as is the case with [[oxyhydrogen]] torches or when extremely [[hydrogen purity|high purity hydrogen]] or oxygen is desired.

Thermodynamically, this would not be expected since the oxidation potential of the chloride ion is less than that of water, but the rate of the chloride reaction is much greater than that of water, causing it to predominate.  The hydrogen produced from this process is either burned (converting it back to water), used for the production of [[specialty chemicals]], or various other small-scale applications.\n\nWater electrolysis is also used to generate oxygen for the [[International Space Station]].<ref name=asme>{{cite web| title=Making Space Safer with Electrolysis| url=http://www.asme.org/kb/news---articles/articles/aerospace---defense/making-space-safer-with-electrolysis| publisher=[[ASME]]| accessdate=26 May 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515233531/http://www.asme.org/kb/news---articles/articles/aerospace---defense/making-space-safer-with-electrolysis| archive-date=15 May 2012| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=nasa>{{cite web| title=Breathing Easy on the Space Station| url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast13nov_1/| publisher=NASA Science| accessdate=26 May 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519020228/http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast13nov_1/| archive-date=19 May 2012| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHydrogen may later be used in a [[fuel cell]] as a storage method of energy and water.<ref name=storage>{{cite web|title=Solar Hydrogen Fuel Cell Water Heater (Educational Stand)|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/34346401/Solar-Hydrogen-Fuel-Cell-Water-Heater-Educational-Stand|via=[[Scribd]]|access-date=9 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808184750/https://www.scribd.com/doc/34346401/Solar-Hydrogen-Fuel-Cell-Water-Heater-Educational-Stand|archive-date=8 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Efficiency==\n\n=== Industrial output ===\nEfficiency of modern hydrogen generators is measured by ''energy consumed per standard volume of hydrogen'' (MJ/m<sup>3</sup>), assuming [[standard temperature and pressure]] of the H<sub>2</sub>.
