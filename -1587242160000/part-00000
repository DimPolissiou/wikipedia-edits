He became the first foreign-born Editor-in-Chief of the [[Columbia Law Review]].

He graduated from Odessa Gymnasium in 1919, before fleeing from [[Russia]] in 1920 at the time of the [[Russian Revolution]]. He moved to [[Leipzig, Germany]] where he studied for a year before moving to [[Vienna, Austria]] until 1924. After living in Vienna for 3 years he immigrated to [[Florence, Italy]] where he studied law.

Two years after his graduation from the University of Florence, his [[graduate thesis]] was published under the Italian title \"ll diritto come volont\u00e0 costante\", (\"The Law as a Constant Will\").

Because of this and the general growing antisemitism,  Pekelis and his family left Italy. He moved to [[Paris]] where he practiced law until 1940.

He wrote the script to the 2017 slasher film ''[[Happy Death Day]]''.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nLobdell did not begin to read comics until he was 17 years old, while lying in bed after lung surgery. Later, he went to college to study [[psychology]], but quit two years later when he began to write. While in college, he wrote for the college newspaper and interviewed Marvel editor [[Al Milgrom]]. Lobdell started submitting various stories to Marvel, but was systematically rejected by various editors, including [[Tom DeFalco]]. Later, DeFalco started editing [[Marvel Comics Presents]] (a bi-weekly book) requiring many writers, pencillers and inkers. Lobdell submitted a story about a character from [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]. Because the characters involved were rather obscure, DeFalco did not need to extract approval from other editors, and he decided to give Lobdell a chance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVGQ5km9BuY&feature=list_related&playnext=1&list=SP3E42FDB3CA564492|title=Ask Scott Lobdell, DC Universe Comic Book Writer, Anything!|accessdate=13 January 2019|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n===Marvel Comics===\nIn the 1990s, Lobdell became known for his work on [[Marvel Comics]]' [[X-Men]]-related titles, specifically ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', the main title itself, and the spin-off series that he conceived with artist [[Chris Bachalo]], ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]''. He wrote the first 28 issues of ''Generation X'', and at one point was writing both main X-Men titles for a lengthy run. ''Generation X'' focused on a number of young mutant students who attempted to become [[superhero]]es in their own right at a separate school with the guidance of veteran X-related characters [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and [[Emma Frost]]. He also had runs with the ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' and ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' titles. Scott Lobell was the primary creative force behind most of the major X-title related storylines, especially the major cross-overs, throughout a majority of the 1990s, including \"[[X-Cutioner's Song]]\", \"[[Fatal Attractions (comics)|Fatal Attractions]]\", \"[[Phalanx Covenant]]\", \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\", the \"[[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]\" saga, and \"[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]\". He returned briefly to Marvel in 2001, to try and tie up loose ends he left behind and wrote one last storyline, dubbed \"Eve of Destruction\".\n\nMany of the concepts and even characters created by Scott Lobdell and fellow X-Men writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] were used throughout the run of the popular 1990s ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]''. Lobdell is even referenced in episode #46 of the show, \"One Man's Worth\", where he poses as a human used to fuel [[Trevor Fitzroy]]'s mutant power to travel through time. The scene shows [[Master Mold]] saying \"Lobdell, I have a job for you.\" He is then grabbed by Fitzroy, who absorbs his life energy and creates a time portal.\n\nLobdell had writing stints on Marvel's ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'','' [[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]'' [[mini-series]] with artist [[Gene Ha]]. He also wrote several of the first issues of the \"[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]\" reboots of both [[Iron Man]] and [[Fantastic Four]].\n\nLobdell wrote the 1992 issue of ''Alpha Flight'' in which the superhero [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] \u2013 originally intended to be gay, but [[closeted]] by the publisher's existing policy against openly LGBT characters \u2013 declared that he is gay,<ref>[http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#106] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126025406/http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects |date=2013-01-26 }}</ref><ref>Mangels, Andy (2006), In and Out: A Brief History of Marvel's 2006 Gay Policies, Prism Comics, retrieved 2009-03-29</ref> in a storyline intended to also address the HIV/AIDS epidemic.<ref>Alpha Flight #106</ref> Royalties from that issue were donated to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.\n\n===Other work===\nLobdell wrote the script to ''[[Stan Lee's Mosaic]]'' and an upcoming film from [[POW!

He wrote the script to the 2017 slasher film ''[[Happy Death Day]]''.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nLobdell did not begin to read comics until he was 17 years old, while lying in bed after lung surgery. Later, he went to college to study [[psychology]], but quit two years later when he began to write. While in college, he wrote for the college newspaper and interviewed Marvel editor [[Al Milgrom]]. Lobdell started submitting various stories to Marvel, but was systematically rejected by various editors, including [[Tom DeFalco]]. Later, DeFalco started editing [[Marvel Comics Presents]] (a bi-weekly book) requiring many writers, pencillers and inkers. Lobdell submitted a story about a character from [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]. Because the characters involved were rather obscure, DeFalco did not need to extract approval from other editors, and he decided to give Lobdell a chance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVGQ5km9BuY&feature=list_related&playnext=1&list=SP3E42FDB3CA564492|title=Ask Scott Lobdell, DC Universe Comic Book Writer, Anything!|accessdate=13 January 2019|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n===Marvel Comics===\nIn the 1990s, Lobdell became known for his work on [[Marvel Comics]]' [[X-Men]]-related titles, specifically ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', the main title itself, and the spin-off series that he conceived with artist [[Chris Bachalo]], ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]''. He wrote the first 28 issues of ''Generation X'', and at one point was writing both main X-Men titles for a lengthy run. ''Generation X'' focused on a number of young mutant students who attempted to become [[superhero]]es in their own right at a separate school with the guidance of veteran X-related characters [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and [[Emma Frost]]. He also had runs with the ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' and ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' titles. Scott Lobell was the primary creative force behind most of the major X-title related storylines, especially the major cross-overs, throughout a majority of the 1990s, including \"[[X-Cutioner's Song]]\", \"[[Fatal Attractions (comics)|Fatal Attractions]]\", \"[[Phalanx Covenant]]\", \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\", the \"[[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]\" saga, and \"[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]\". He returned briefly to Marvel in 2001, to try and tie up loose ends he left behind and wrote one last storyline, dubbed \"Eve of Destruction\".\n\nMany of the concepts and even characters created by Scott Lobdell and fellow X-Men writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] were used throughout the run of the popular 1990s ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]''. Lobdell is even referenced in episode #46 of the show, \"One Man's Worth\", where he poses as a human used to fuel [[Trevor Fitzroy]]'s mutant power to travel through time. The scene shows [[Master Mold]] saying \"Lobdell, I have a job for you.\" He is then grabbed by Fitzroy, who absorbs his life energy and creates a time portal.\n\nLobdell had writing stints on Marvel's ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'','' [[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]'' [[mini-series]] with artist [[Gene Ha]]. He also wrote several of the first issues of the \"[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]\" reboots of both [[Iron Man]] and [[Fantastic Four]].\n\nLobdell wrote the 1992 issue of ''Alpha Flight'' in which the superhero [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] \u2013 originally intended to be gay, but [[closeted]] by the publisher's existing policy against openly LGBT characters \u2013 declared that he is gay,<ref>[http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#106] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126025406/http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects |date=2013-01-26 }}</ref><ref>Mangels, Andy (2006), In and Out: A Brief History of Marvel's 2006 Gay Policies, Prism Comics, retrieved 2009-03-29</ref> in a storyline intended to also address the HIV/AIDS epidemic.<ref>Alpha Flight #106</ref> Royalties from that issue were donated to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.\n\n===Other work===\nLobdell wrote the script to ''[[Stan Lee's Mosaic]]'' and an upcoming film from [[POW!

He did not enjoy the experience and after joining Acton County Grammar School aged 11, switched to the trumpet,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=25}} moving to the [[French horn]] when he joined the Middlesex Schools Symphony Orchestra.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=12}} He met [[Pete Townshend]] in the second year of school, and the two formed a [[trad jazz]] band, the Confederates. The group only played one gig together, before they decided that [[rock and roll]] was a more attractive prospect.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=26}} Entwistle, in particular, was having difficulty hearing his trumpet with rock bands, and decided to switch to playing guitar, but due to his large fingers, and also his fondness for the low guitar tones of [[Duane Eddy]], he decided to take up the bass guitar instead.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=29}} He made his own instrument at home, and soon attracted the attention of [[Roger Daltrey]], who had been the year above Entwistle at Acton County, but had since left to work in sheet metal. Daltrey was aware of Entwistle from school, and asked him to join as a bass guitarist for his band, the Detours.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=30,32}}\n\n==Career==\n===The Who===\n{{main|The Who}}\nAfter joining the Detours, Entwistle played a major role in encouraging [[Pete Townshend]]'s budding talent on the guitar, and insisting that Townshend be admitted into the band as well. Eventually, Roger Daltrey fired all the members of his band with the exception of Entwistle, Townshend and the drummer, [[Doug Sandom]], a semi-pro player who was several years older than the others. Daltrey relinquished the role of guitarist to Townshend in 1963, instead becoming frontman and lead singer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The band considered several changes of name, finally settling on the name The Who while Entwistle was still working as a tax clerk (temporarily performing as the High Numbers for four months in 1964).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1213203.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; The Who bassist Entwistle dies |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2002-06-28 |accessdate=2014-07-04}}</ref> When the band decided that the blond Daltrey needed to stand out more from the others, Entwistle dyed his naturally light brown hair black, and it remained so until the early 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAround 1963, Entwistle played in a London band called the Initials for a short while; the band broke up when a planned resident engagement in Spain fell through.\n\nIn 1967, Entwistle married his childhood sweetheart Alison Wise and bought a large [[semi-detached]] home in [[Acton, London|Stanmore]] Middlesex  filling it with all sorts of extraordinary artefacts, ranging from suits of armour to a tarantula spider. His eccentricity and taste for the bizarre was to remain with him throughout his life, and when he finally moved out of the city in 1978, to [[Stow-on-the-Wold]] in Gloucestershire, his 17-bedroom mansion, [[Quarwood]], resembled a museum. It also housed one of the largest guitar collections belonging to any rock musician.<ref name=\"thewho1\"/>\n\nEntwistle picked up two nicknames during his career as a musician. He was nicknamed \"The Ox\" because of his strong constitution and seeming ability to \"eat, drink or do more than the rest of them\". He was also later nicknamed \"Thunderfingers\". [[Bill Wyman]], bass guitarist for [[the Rolling Stones]], described him as \"the quietest man in private but the loudest man on stage\". Entwistle was one of the first to make use of [[Marshall micro stack|Marshall stacks]] in an attempt to hear himself over the noise of his band members, who famously leapt and moved about on the stage, with Townshend and [[Keith Moon]] smashing their instruments on numerous occasions (Moon even used explosives in his drum kit during one television performance on the ''[[Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]''). Townshend later remarked that Entwistle started using Marshall amplification to hear himself over Moon's rapid-fire drumming style, and Townshend himself also had to use them just to be heard over Entwistle. They both continued expanding and experimenting with their rigs, until they were both using twin stacks with new experimental [[prototype]] 200 watt amps, at a time when most bands used 50\u2013100 watt amplifiers with single cabinets. All of this quickly gained the Who a reputation for being \"the loudest band on the planet\"; they reached 126 decibels at a 1976 concert in London, listed in the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] as the loudest rock concert in history. The band had a strong influence at the time on their contemporaries' choice of equipment, with [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] both following suit. Although they pioneered and directly contributed to the development of the \"classic\" Marshall sound (at this point their equipment was being built or tweaked to their personal specifications), they only used Marshall equipment for a few years. Entwistle eventually switched to using a [[Hiwatt|Sound City]] rig, with Townshend following suit later as well. Townshend points out that [[Jimi Hendrix]], their new label mate, was influenced beyond just the band's volume. Both Entwistle and Townshend had begun experimenting with feedback from the amplifiers in the mid-1960s, and Hendrix did not begin destroying his instruments until after he had witnessed the Who's \"auto-destructive art\".\n[[File:John Entwistle in 1967 with The Who.jpg|thumb|220px|Entwistle backstage before a gig at [[Friedrich-Ebert-Halle]] in [[Ludwigshafen|Ludwigshafen, Germany]] on 12 April 1967|alt=]]\n\nEntwistle's wry and sometimes dark sense of humour clashed at times with Townshend's more introspective, intellectual work. Although he wrote songs on every Who album except for ''Quadrophenia'', he was frustrated at Townshend not allowing him to sing them himself. As he said, \"I got a couple [of songs] on per album but my problem was that I wanted to sing the songs and not let Roger sing them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/j/john_entwistle.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130726010940/http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/j/john_entwistle.html|url-status=dead|title=John Entwistle Quotes |publisher= BrainyQuote|date=26 July 2013|archivedate=26 July 2013 }}</ref> This was a large part of the reason{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} that he became the first member of the band to release a solo album, ''[[Smash Your Head Against the Wall]]'' (1971) which featured contributions from Keith Moon, [[Jerry Shirley]], [[Vivian Stanshall]], [[Neil Innes]] and the Who's roadie, Dave \"Cyrano\" Langston.\n\nHe was the only member of the band to have had formal musical training.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/john-entwistle-i-just-wanted-to-play-louder-than-anyone-else|title=John Entwistle: \"I just wanted to play louder than anyone else\"|first=Paul |last=Rees |website=[[Classic Rock Magazine]]|accessdate=12 June 2019}}</ref> In addition to the bass guitar, he contributed backing vocals and performed on the [[French horn]] (heard on \"[[Pictures of Lily]]\"), trumpet, piano, [[bugle]], and [[Jew's harp]], and on some occasions he sang the lead vocals on his compositions. He layered several horns to create the brass section as heard on songs such as \"[[5:15]]\", among others, while recording the Who's studio albums, and for concerts, arranged a [[horn section]] to perform with the band.\n\n[[File:John Entwisle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Entwistle playing at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], Toronto 1976]]\nWhile Entwistle was known for being the quietest member of the Who, he in fact often exerted major influences on the rest of the band. For instance, Entwistle was the first member of the band to wear a Union Jack waistcoat. This piece of clothing later became one of Townshend's signature garments.<ref>[{{cite document|last1=Eliscu|first1=Jenny|title=Rock & Roll: John Entwistle - The Who Bassist Dies at Fifty-Seven on the Eve of a Major U.S. Tour|publisher=Rolling Stone LLC|id={{ProQuest|1193455}}}}]</ref>\n\nIn 1974, he compiled ''[[Odds & Sods]]'', a collection of unreleased Who material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewho.com/music/odds-and-sods/|title=Odds And Sods|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2019}}</ref>\nEntwistle designed the cover art for the band's 1975 album ''[[The Who by Numbers]]'' and in a 1996 interview remarked that it had cost \u00a330 to create, while the ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' cover, designed by Pete Townshend, had cost \u00a316,000.\n\nEntwistle also experimented throughout his career with \"Bi-amping,\" where the high and low ends of the bass are sent through separate signal paths, allowing for more control over the output. At one point his rig became so loaded down with speaker cabinets and processing gear that it was dubbed \"Little Manhattan,\" in reference to the towering, skyscraper-like stacks, racks and blinking lights.\n\n====Songwriting====\nWhile Townshend emerged as the Who's songwriter-in-chief, Entwistle began making distinctive contributions to the band's catalogue, beginning with \"Whiskey Man\" and \"[[Boris the Spider]]\" on the ''[[A Quick One]]'' album in 1966, continuing with \"Doctor, Doctor\" and \"Someone's Coming\" (1967); \"Silas Stingy\", \"Heinz Baked Beans\" and \"Medac\" from ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' (1967); \"[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (The Who song)|Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde]]\" (1968); and \"[[Heaven and Hell (The Who song)|Heaven and Hell]]\", with which the Who opened their live shows between 1968 and 1970. Entwistle wrote \"Cousin Kevin\" and \"Fiddle About\" for the Who's 1969 album ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]'' because Townshend had specifically requested Entwistle to write 'nasty songs' that he felt uncomfortable with. \"[[My Wife]]\", Entwistle's driving, comedic song about marital strife from 1971's ''[[Who's Next]]'', also became a popular stage number. He wrote \"Success Story\" for ''[[The Who by Numbers]]'' (1975), for which he also drew the illustration on the album cover; \"[[Had Enough (The Who song)|Had Enough]]\", \"905\", and \"[[Trick of the Light (The Who song)|Trick of the Light]]\" for ''[[Who Are You]]'' (1978); \"[[The Quiet One (The Who song)|The Quiet One]]\" and \"You\" for ''[[Face Dances]]'' (1981); and \"It's Your Turn\", \"Dangerous\" and \"One at a Time\" for ''[[It's Hard]]'' (1982), his final album with the Who.<ref name=\"thewho1\"/>\n\n===Other work===\n\n====Solo career====\nIn 1971, Entwistle became the first member to release a solo album, ''[[Smash Your Head Against the Wall]]'', which earned him a cult following in the US for fans of his brand of black humour.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Other solo studio albums included: ''[[Whistle Rymes]]'' (1972), ''[[Rigor Mortis Sets In]]'' (1973), ''[[Mad Dog (album)|Mad Dog]]'' (1975), ''[[Too Late the Hero (album)|Too Late the Hero]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Rock (John Entwistle album)|The Rock]]'' (1996). The band was preoccupied with recording ''[[The Who by Numbers]]'' during the spring of 1975 and did not do any touring for most of the year, so Entwistle spent the summer performing solo concerts. He also fronted the John Entwistle Band on US club tours during the 1990s, and appeared with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]] in 1995. A talented artist, Entwistle held regular exhibitions of his paintings, with many of them featuring the Who.<ref name=\"thewho1\"/> In 1984 he became the first artist besides [[Arlen Roth]] to record an instructional video for Roth's company Hot Licks Video.\n\n====Later years====\nIn 1990, Entwistle toured with [[The Best (band)|the Best]], a short-lived [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] which included [[Keith Emerson]], [[Joe Walsh]], [[Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter]], and [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]]. Towards the end of his career, he formed the John Entwistle Project with longtime friend, drummer [[Steve Luongo]], and guitarist Mark Hitt, both formerly of Rat Race Choir. This evolved into \"The John Entwistle Band\", with Godfrey Townsend replacing Mark Hitt on guitar and joining harmony vocals. In 1996, the band went on the \"Left for Dead\" tour with Alan St. Jon joining on keyboards. After Entwistle toured with the Who for ''Quadrophenia'' in 1996\u201397, the John Entwistle Band set off on the \"Left for Dead \u2013 the Sequel\" tour in late 1998, now with Gordon Cotten on keyboards. After this second venture, the band released an album of highlights from the tour, titled ''Left for Live'' and a studio album ''[[Music from Van-Pires]]'' in 2000. The album featured lost demos of Who drummer [[Keith Moon]] together with newly recorded parts by the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/music-from-van-pires-mw0000976230|title=Music from Van-Pires - The John Entwistle Band - Songs, Reviews, Credits|website= [[AllMusic]]}}</ref> In 1995, Entwistle also toured and recorded with [[Ringo Starr]] in one of the incarnations of Starr's [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]]. This one also featured [[Billy Preston]], [[Randy Bachman]], and [[Mark Farner]]. In this ensemble, he played and sang \"[[Boris the Spider]]\" as his Who showpiece, along with \"[[My Wife]]\". Toward the end of his career he used a Status Graphite Buzzard Bass, which he had designed. From 1999 to early 2002, he played as part of the Who. Entwistle also played at [[Woodstock '99]], being the only performer there to have taken the stage at the original Woodstock. As a side project, he played the bass guitar in a country-rock album project of original songs called the Pioneers, with Mickey Wynne on lead guitar, Ron Magness on rhythm guitar and keyboards, Roy Michaels, Andre Beeka on vocals, and John Delgado playing drums. The album was released on Voiceprint. Shortly before his death, Entwistle had agreed to play some US dates with the band including Nashville's [[Grand Ole Opry]], following his final upcoming tour with the Who.\n\nIn 2001, he played in [[Alan Parsons]]' [[The Beatles|Beatles]] tribute show ''[[A Walk Down Abbey Road]]''. The show also featured [[Ann Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[David Pack]] of [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]], Godfrey Townsend, Steve Luongo, and [[John Beck (It Bites)|John Beck]]. That year he also played with the Who at [[the Concert for New York City]]. He also joined forces again with the John Entwistle Band for an 8-gig tour. This time Chris Clark played keyboards. From January\u2013February, 2002, Entwistle played his last concerts with the Who in a handful of dates in England, the last being on 8 February at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. In late 2002, an expanded 2-CD ''Left for Live Deluxe'' was released, highlighting the John Entwistle Band's performances.\n\n====Art====\nBetween 1996 and 2002, Entwistle attended dozens of art openings in his honour. He chatted with each collector, personalising their art with a quote and a sketch of \"[[Boris the Spider|Boris]]\". In early 2002, Entwistle finished what was his last drawing. \"Eyes Wide Shut\" represented a new style for Entwistle. Featuring [[Jimi Hendrix]], Pete Townshend, [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Eric Clapton]], Entwistle's style had evolved from simple line drawings and caricatures to a more lifelike representation of his subjects. He was more confident and relaxed with his art and ready to share that with his collectors.<ref name=\"thewho1\"/>\n\nEntwistle wrote this on one of his pictures:\n<blockquote>Now ... ! I'm still the Bass Guitarist. If you're reading this Bio at a show \u2013 don't forget to wave \u2013 I'm the one on the left. If you're reading this at an Art Show \u2013 Help support a starving Artist BUY SOMETHING!<ref name=\"thewho1\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nEntwistle died in Room 658 at the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]], on 27 June 2002, one day before the scheduled first show of the Who's [[The Who Tour 2002|2002 United States tour]].

He changed his style between songs and even during songs to alter the sound he produced. His fingering technique involved plucking strings very forcefully to produce a trebly, twangy sound. He changed his thumb position from [[pickup (music technology)|pick-up]] to the E string and occasionally even positioned his thumb near the pick-up. His plectrum technique involved holding the plectrum between his thumb and forefinger, with the rest of his fingers outstretched for balance.\n\nThe Who's studio recordings seldom did justice to Entwistle's playing, in part because he was better heard in concert, where he and Pete Townshend frequently exchanged roles, with Entwistle providing rapid melodic lines and Townshend anchoring the song with rhythmic chord work. At the same time, Townshend noted that Entwistle provided the true rhythmic timekeeping in the band, while Keith Moon, with his flourishes around the kit, was more like a keyboard player. In 1989, Entwistle pointed out that, by modern standards, \"the Who haven't got a proper bass player.\"<ref>Guitar Player's Chris Jisi in 1989</ref>\n\nEntwistle also developed what he called a \"typewriter\" approach to playing the bass. It involved positioning his right hand over the strings so all four fingers could be used to tap percussively on the strings, causing them to strike the fretboard with a distinctive twangy sound. This gave him the ability to play three or four strings at once, or to use several fingers on a single string. It allowed him to create passages that were both percussive and melodic. This method should not be confused with [[tapping]] or [[Slapping (music)|slapping]], and in fact predates these techniques. Modern players such as [[Ryan Martinie]] of [[Mudvayne]] have used similar techniques. Entwistle can be seen using this technique in [[Mike Gordon]]'s film, ''[[Rising Low]]''. Notable in his left-hand technique was his use of slides, positioning his left hand for octaves, and his use of the [[pentatonic]] when playing with the Who.\n\nEntwistle was notorious for the extremely high volume at which he played bass, going so far as to rig pick-ups to each string on his instruments. This led to him developing hearing loss, similar to Townshend. Although not as public about his problems as Townshend, he reputedly had to rely on lip reading to understand speech in his later years. [[Randy Bachman]] of [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]] claimed that towards the end of his life, Entwistle mostly played by feeling the rush of air from his giant amp stacks.<ref>''Randy Bachman's Vinyl Tap Stories'', p. 45</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nEntwistle identified his influences as a combination of his school training on French horn, trumpet, and piano (giving his fingers strength and dexterity).

In a music career that spanned more than 40 years, Entwistle was best known as the original bass guitarist for the English rock band [[the Who]]. He was the only member of the band to have formal musical training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0904339.html |title=24 X 7 |publisher=Infoplease.com |date=2002-06-27 |accessdate=2014-07-04}}{{fails verification|date=June 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Bassist of the Millennium\">{{cite web | url=http://www.johnentwistle.com/images/bass2kscans.html | title=Bassist of the Millennium | work=Guitar magazine | date=2000 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930020727/http://www.johnentwistle.com/images/bass2kscans.html | archivedate=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{fails verification|date=June 2019}} He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Who in 1990.\n\nEntwistle's instrumental approach used [[pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] lead lines, and a then-unusual treble-rich sound (\"full treble, full volume\") created by [[roundwound]] [[RotoSound]] steel bass strings.

His father, Herbert, played the trumpet{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=26}} and his mother, Maud (29 November 1922 \u2013 4 March 2011),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classicrockmen.livejournal.com/2848.html|title=Queenie Entwistle 29th November 1922 to 3rd March 2011|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref> played the piano.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=25}} His parents' marriage failed soon after he was born, and he was mostly raised by his mother at his grandparents' house in [[South Acton, London|South Acton]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=12}} Divorce was uncommon in the 1940s, and this contributed to Entwistle becoming reserved and socialising little.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=25}}\n\nHis musical career began aged 7, when he started taking piano lessons. He did not enjoy the experience and after joining Acton County Grammar School aged 11, switched to the trumpet,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=25}} moving to the [[French horn]] when he joined the Middlesex Schools Symphony Orchestra.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=12}} He met [[Pete Townshend]] in the second year of school, and the two formed a [[trad jazz]] band, the Confederates. The group only played one gig together, before they decided that [[rock and roll]] was a more attractive prospect.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=26}} Entwistle, in particular, was having difficulty hearing his trumpet with rock bands, and decided to switch to playing guitar, but due to his large fingers, and also his fondness for the low guitar tones of [[Duane Eddy]], he decided to take up the bass guitar instead.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=29}} He made his own instrument at home, and soon attracted the attention of [[Roger Daltrey]], who had been the year above Entwistle at Acton County, but had since left to work in sheet metal. Daltrey was aware of Entwistle from school, and asked him to join as a bass guitarist for his band, the Detours.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=30,32}}\n\n==Career==\n===The Who===\n{{main|The Who}}\nAfter joining the Detours, Entwistle played a major role in encouraging [[Pete Townshend]]'s budding talent on the guitar, and insisting that Townshend be admitted into the band as well. Eventually, Roger Daltrey fired all the members of his band with the exception of Entwistle, Townshend and the drummer, [[Doug Sandom]], a semi-pro player who was several years older than the others. Daltrey relinquished the role of guitarist to Townshend in 1963, instead becoming frontman and lead singer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The band considered several changes of name, finally settling on the name The Who while Entwistle was still working as a tax clerk (temporarily performing as the High Numbers for four months in 1964).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1213203.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; The Who bassist Entwistle dies |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2002-06-28 |accessdate=2014-07-04}}</ref> When the band decided that the blond Daltrey needed to stand out more from the others, Entwistle dyed his naturally light brown hair black, and it remained so until the early 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAround 1963, Entwistle played in a London band called the Initials for a short while; the band broke up when a planned resident engagement in Spain fell through.\n\nIn 1967, Entwistle married his childhood sweetheart Alison Wise and bought a large [[semi-detached]] home in [[Acton, London|Stanmore]] Middlesex  filling it with all sorts of extraordinary artefacts, ranging from suits of armour to a tarantula spider. His eccentricity and taste for the bizarre was to remain with him throughout his life, and when he finally moved out of the city in 1978, to [[Stow-on-the-Wold]] in Gloucestershire, his 17-bedroom mansion, [[Quarwood]], resembled a museum. It also housed one of the largest guitar collections belonging to any rock musician.<ref name=\"thewho1\"/>\n\nEntwistle picked up two nicknames during his career as a musician. He was nicknamed \"The Ox\" because of his strong constitution and seeming ability to \"eat, drink or do more than the rest of them\". He was also later nicknamed \"Thunderfingers\". [[Bill Wyman]], bass guitarist for [[the Rolling Stones]], described him as \"the quietest man in private but the loudest man on stage\". Entwistle was one of the first to make use of [[Marshall micro stack|Marshall stacks]] in an attempt to hear himself over the noise of his band members, who famously leapt and moved about on the stage, with Townshend and [[Keith Moon]] smashing their instruments on numerous occasions (Moon even used explosives in his drum kit during one television performance on the ''[[Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]''). Townshend later remarked that Entwistle started using Marshall amplification to hear himself over Moon's rapid-fire drumming style, and Townshend himself also had to use them just to be heard over Entwistle. They both continued expanding and experimenting with their rigs, until they were both using twin stacks with new experimental [[prototype]] 200 watt amps, at a time when most bands used 50\u2013100 watt amplifiers with single cabinets. All of this quickly gained the Who a reputation for being \"the loudest band on the planet\"; they reached 126 decibels at a 1976 concert in London, listed in the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] as the loudest rock concert in history. The band had a strong influence at the time on their contemporaries' choice of equipment, with [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] both following suit. Although they pioneered and directly contributed to the development of the \"classic\" Marshall sound (at this point their equipment was being built or tweaked to their personal specifications), they only used Marshall equipment for a few years. Entwistle eventually switched to using a [[Hiwatt|Sound City]] rig, with Townshend following suit later as well. Townshend points out that [[Jimi Hendrix]], their new label mate, was influenced beyond just the band's volume. Both Entwistle and Townshend had begun experimenting with feedback from the amplifiers in the mid-1960s, and Hendrix did not begin destroying his instruments until after he had witnessed the Who's \"auto-destructive art\".\n[[File:John Entwistle in 1967 with The Who.jpg|thumb|220px|Entwistle backstage before a gig at [[Friedrich-Ebert-Halle]] in [[Ludwigshafen|Ludwigshafen, Germany]] on 12 April 1967|alt=]]\n\nEntwistle's wry and sometimes dark sense of humour clashed at times with Townshend's more introspective, intellectual work. Although he wrote songs on every Who album except for ''Quadrophenia'', he was frustrated at Townshend not allowing him to sing them himself. As he said, \"I got a couple [of songs] on per album but my problem was that I wanted to sing the songs and not let Roger sing them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/j/john_entwistle.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130726010940/http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/j/john_entwistle.html|url-status=dead|title=John Entwistle Quotes |publisher= BrainyQuote|date=26 July 2013|archivedate=26 July 2013 }}</ref> This was a large part of the reason{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} that he became the first member of the band to release a solo album, ''[[Smash Your Head Against the Wall]]'' (1971) which featured contributions from Keith Moon, [[Jerry Shirley]], [[Vivian Stanshall]], [[Neil Innes]] and the Who's roadie, Dave \"Cyrano\" Langston.\n\nHe was the only member of the band to have had formal musical training.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/john-entwistle-i-just-wanted-to-play-louder-than-anyone-else|title=John Entwistle: \"I just wanted to play louder than anyone else\"|first=Paul |last=Rees |website=[[Classic Rock Magazine]]|accessdate=12 June 2019}}</ref> In addition to the bass guitar, he contributed backing vocals and performed on the [[French horn]] (heard on \"[[Pictures of Lily]]\"), trumpet, piano, [[bugle]], and [[Jew's harp]], and on some occasions he sang the lead vocals on his compositions. He layered several horns to create the brass section as heard on songs such as \"[[5:15]]\", among others, while recording the Who's studio albums, and for concerts, arranged a [[horn section]] to perform with the band.\n\n[[File:John Entwisle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Entwistle playing at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], Toronto 1976]]\nWhile Entwistle was known for being the quietest member of the Who, he in fact often exerted major influences on the rest of the band. For instance, Entwistle was the first member of the band to wear a Union Jack waistcoat. This piece of clothing later became one of Townshend's signature garments.<ref>[{{cite document|last1=Eliscu|first1=Jenny|title=Rock & Roll: John Entwistle - The Who Bassist Dies at Fifty-Seven on the Eve of a Major U.S. Tour|publisher=Rolling Stone LLC|id={{ProQuest|1193455}}}}]</ref>\n\nIn 1974, he compiled ''[[Odds & Sods]]'', a collection of unreleased Who material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewho.com/music/odds-and-sods/|title=Odds And Sods|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2019}}</ref>\nEntwistle designed the cover art for the band's 1975 album ''[[The Who by Numbers]]'' and in a 1996 interview remarked that it had cost \u00a330 to create, while the ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' cover, designed by Pete Townshend, had cost \u00a316,000.\n\nEntwistle also experimented throughout his career with \"Bi-amping,\" where the high and low ends of the bass are sent through separate signal paths, allowing for more control over the output. At one point his rig became so loaded down with speaker cabinets and processing gear that it was dubbed \"Little Manhattan,\" in reference to the towering, skyscraper-like stacks, racks and blinking lights.\n\n====Songwriting====\nWhile Townshend emerged as the Who's songwriter-in-chief, Entwistle began making distinctive contributions to the band's catalogue, beginning with \"Whiskey Man\" and \"[[Boris the Spider]]\" on the ''[[A Quick One]]'' album in 1966, continuing with \"Doctor, Doctor\" and \"Someone's Coming\" (1967); \"Silas Stingy\", \"Heinz Baked Beans\" and \"Medac\" from ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' (1967); \"[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (The Who song)|Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde]]\" (1968); and \"[[Heaven and Hell (The Who song)|Heaven and Hell]]\", with which the Who opened their live shows between 1968 and 1970. Entwistle wrote \"Cousin Kevin\" and \"Fiddle About\" for the Who's 1969 album ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]'' because Townshend had specifically requested Entwistle to write 'nasty songs' that he felt uncomfortable with. \"[[My Wife]]\", Entwistle's driving, comedic song about marital strife from 1971's ''[[Who's Next]]'', also became a popular stage number. He wrote \"Success Story\" for ''[[The Who by Numbers]]'' (1975), for which he also drew the illustration on the album cover; \"[[Had Enough (The Who song)|Had Enough]]\", \"905\", and \"[[Trick of the Light (The Who song)|Trick of the Light]]\" for ''[[Who Are You]]'' (1978); \"[[The Quiet One (The Who song)|The Quiet One]]\" and \"You\" for ''[[Face Dances]]'' (1981); and \"It's Your Turn\", \"Dangerous\" and \"One at a Time\" for ''[[It's Hard]]'' (1982), his final album with the Who.<ref name=\"thewho1\"/>\n\n===Other work===\n\n====Solo career====\nIn 1971, Entwistle became the first member to release a solo album, ''[[Smash Your Head Against the Wall]]'', which earned him a cult following in the US for fans of his brand of black humour.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Other solo studio albums included: ''[[Whistle Rymes]]'' (1972), ''[[Rigor Mortis Sets In]]'' (1973), ''[[Mad Dog (album)|Mad Dog]]'' (1975), ''[[Too Late the Hero (album)|Too Late the Hero]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Rock (John Entwistle album)|The Rock]]'' (1996). The band was preoccupied with recording ''[[The Who by Numbers]]'' during the spring of 1975 and did not do any touring for most of the year, so Entwistle spent the summer performing solo concerts. He also fronted the John Entwistle Band on US club tours during the 1990s, and appeared with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]] in 1995. A talented artist, Entwistle held regular exhibitions of his paintings, with many of them featuring the Who.<ref name=\"thewho1\"/> In 1984 he became the first artist besides [[Arlen Roth]] to record an instructional video for Roth's company Hot Licks Video.\n\n====Later years====\nIn 1990, Entwistle toured with [[The Best (band)|the Best]], a short-lived [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] which included [[Keith Emerson]], [[Joe Walsh]], [[Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter]], and [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]]. Towards the end of his career, he formed the John Entwistle Project with longtime friend, drummer [[Steve Luongo]], and guitarist Mark Hitt, both formerly of Rat Race Choir. This evolved into \"The John Entwistle Band\", with Godfrey Townsend replacing Mark Hitt on guitar and joining harmony vocals. In 1996, the band went on the \"Left for Dead\" tour with Alan St. Jon joining on keyboards. After Entwistle toured with the Who for ''Quadrophenia'' in 1996\u201397, the John Entwistle Band set off on the \"Left for Dead \u2013 the Sequel\" tour in late 1998, now with Gordon Cotten on keyboards. After this second venture, the band released an album of highlights from the tour, titled ''Left for Live'' and a studio album ''[[Music from Van-Pires]]'' in 2000. The album featured lost demos of Who drummer [[Keith Moon]] together with newly recorded parts by the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/music-from-van-pires-mw0000976230|title=Music from Van-Pires - The John Entwistle Band - Songs, Reviews, Credits|website= [[AllMusic]]}}</ref> In 1995, Entwistle also toured and recorded with [[Ringo Starr]] in one of the incarnations of Starr's [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]]. This one also featured [[Billy Preston]], [[Randy Bachman]], and [[Mark Farner]]. In this ensemble, he played and sang \"[[Boris the Spider]]\" as his Who showpiece, along with \"[[My Wife]]\". Toward the end of his career he used a Status Graphite Buzzard Bass, which he had designed. From 1999 to early 2002, he played as part of the Who. Entwistle also played at [[Woodstock '99]], being the only performer there to have taken the stage at the original Woodstock. As a side project, he played the bass guitar in a country-rock album project of original songs called the Pioneers, with Mickey Wynne on lead guitar, Ron Magness on rhythm guitar and keyboards, Roy Michaels, Andre Beeka on vocals, and John Delgado playing drums. The album was released on Voiceprint. Shortly before his death, Entwistle had agreed to play some US dates with the band including Nashville's [[Grand Ole Opry]], following his final upcoming tour with the Who.\n\nIn 2001, he played in [[Alan Parsons]]' [[The Beatles|Beatles]] tribute show ''[[A Walk Down Abbey Road]]''. The show also featured [[Ann Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[David Pack]] of [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]], Godfrey Townsend, Steve Luongo, and [[John Beck (It Bites)|John Beck]]. That year he also played with the Who at [[the Concert for New York City]]. He also joined forces again with the John Entwistle Band for an 8-gig tour. This time Chris Clark played keyboards. From January\u2013February, 2002, Entwistle played his last concerts with the Who in a handful of dates in England, the last being on 8 February at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. In late 2002, an expanded 2-CD ''Left for Live Deluxe'' was released, highlighting the John Entwistle Band's performances.\n\n====Art====\nBetween 1996 and 2002, Entwistle attended dozens of art openings in his honour. He chatted with each collector, personalising their art with a quote and a sketch of \"[[Boris the Spider|Boris]]\". In early 2002, Entwistle finished what was his last drawing. \"Eyes Wide Shut\" represented a new style for Entwistle. Featuring [[Jimi Hendrix]], Pete Townshend, [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Eric Clapton]], Entwistle's style had evolved from simple line drawings and caricatures to a more lifelike representation of his subjects. He was more confident and relaxed with his art and ready to share that with his collectors.<ref name=\"thewho1\"/>\n\nEntwistle wrote this on one of his pictures:\n<blockquote>Now ... !

He changed his style between songs and even during songs to alter the sound he produced. His fingering technique involved plucking strings very forcefully to produce a trebly, twangy sound. He changed his thumb position from [[pickup (music technology)|pick-up]] to the E string and occasionally even positioned his thumb near the pick-up. His plectrum technique involved holding the plectrum between his thumb and forefinger, with the rest of his fingers outstretched for balance.\n\nThe Who's studio recordings seldom did justice to Entwistle's playing, in part because he was better heard in concert, where he and Pete Townshend frequently exchanged roles, with Entwistle providing rapid melodic lines and Townshend anchoring the song with rhythmic chord work. At the same time, Townshend noted that Entwistle provided the true rhythmic timekeeping in the band, while Keith Moon, with his flourishes around the kit, was more like a keyboard player. In 1989, Entwistle pointed out that, by modern standards, \"the Who haven't got a proper bass player.\"<ref>Guitar Player's Chris Jisi in 1989</ref>\n\nEntwistle also developed what he called a \"typewriter\" approach to playing the bass. It involved positioning his right hand over the strings so all four fingers could be used to tap percussively on the strings, causing them to strike the fretboard with a distinctive twangy sound. This gave him the ability to play three or four strings at once, or to use several fingers on a single string. It allowed him to create passages that were both percussive and melodic. This method should not be confused with [[tapping]] or [[Slapping (music)|slapping]], and in fact predates these techniques. Modern players such as [[Ryan Martinie]] of [[Mudvayne]] have used similar techniques. Entwistle can be seen using this technique in [[Mike Gordon]]'s film, ''[[Rising Low]]''. Notable in his left-hand technique was his use of slides, positioning his left hand for octaves, and his use of the [[pentatonic]] when playing with the Who.\n\nEntwistle was notorious for the extremely high volume at which he played bass, going so far as to rig pick-ups to each string on his instruments. This led to him developing hearing loss, similar to Townshend. Although not as public about his problems as Townshend, he reputedly had to rely on lip reading to understand speech in his later years. [[Randy Bachman]] of [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]] claimed that towards the end of his life, Entwistle mostly played by feeling the rush of air from his giant amp stacks.<ref>''Randy Bachman's Vinyl Tap Stories'', p. 45</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nEntwistle identified his influences as a combination of his school training on French horn, trumpet, and piano (giving his fingers strength and dexterity). Musicians who influenced him included rock & roll guitarists [[Duane Eddy]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1398616/The-Whos-bassist-Entwistle-dies-at-57-on-eve-of-US-tour.html|title=The Who's bassist Entwistle dies at 57 on eve of US tour|first=Nicola Woolcock and Nicole|last=Martin|date=27 June 2002|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> and [[Gene Vincent]], and American soul and R&B bass guitarists such as [[James Jamerson]].<ref>https://www.loudersound.com/features/mike-watt-top-five-bassists-minutemen-firehose-stooges</ref> In turn, Entwistle has been a considerable influence on the playing styles and sounds used by generations of bass guitarists that have followed him, including [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]], <ref>Aerosmith (June 2, 2011). \"Tom Hamilton: Favorite Bass Players\".

The school merged with [[St. Joseph's Catholic College, Bradford|St. Joseph's Catholic College]] in September 2014 to form [[St Bede's and St Joseph's Catholic College]]. The school is based over both of the former school sites.\n\n==School history==\n===Grammar school===\nSt. Bede's Grammar School opened on 12 June 1900, in  Drewton Street, [[Bradford]].  Its first Headmaster was Rev. Dr. [[Arthur Hinsley]], later Rector of the [[Venerable English College, Rome]], Apostolic Delegate to [[Africa]], and Cardinal [[Archbishop of Westminster]] (1935\u20131943).\n\nIn 1919 the school was moved to its present site at Heaton Hall. The old Hall, home of the Rosse family, proved unsatisfactory as the number of pupils continued to grow and a new school was opened in 1939. Since then many additions and alterations have been made to the accommodation. A new technical wing was built in the 1950s, a new refectory and sixth form centre were added in the 1960s.\n\n===Comprehensive===\nThe school has had comprehensive status since the 1960s, and was no longer a grammar school. A Maths/English block was built in the 1970s. New Science laboratories were opened in 2001 and new ICT facilities were provided. By 2008 a new sports hall was opened by Labour Minister for Sports (at the time) [[Gerry Sutcliffe]].  A new extension containing new offices and classrooms was built in the late 2000s.\n\nFrom 2008 the school had one federated governing body with St Joseph's Catholic College and Yorkshire Martyrs Catholic College and when Yorkshire Martyrs closed in 2010 the boys transferred to St Bede's.  An Executive Headteacher was appointed in 2009 to oversee both St Bede's and St Joseph's.\n\n===Merger===\nThe school merged with [[St. Joseph's Catholic College, Bradford|St. Joseph's Catholic College]] in September 2014 to form [[St Bede's and St Joseph's Catholic College]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/11014636.Largest_Catholic_school_in_country_now_planned_as_St_Bede_s_and_St_Joseph_s_may_merge_in_Bradford/ |title=Largest Catholic school in country now planned as St Bede's and St Joseph's may merge in Bradford |newspaper=Bradford Telegraph and Argus |date=17 February 2014 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref> The former St. Bede's is now used as the upper school site of the new school.\n\n==Sixth Form==\nSt Bede's shared an associated sixth form with [[St. Joseph's Catholic College, Bradford|St. Joseph's Catholic College]] for many years.  In 2008 the sixth forms of St Bede's and St Joseph's joined with the sixth form of Yorkshire Martyrs Catholic College to form the Bradford Catholic Sixth Form.

During normal conditions, there was no discussion of estimating and building up stockpiles for use in emergencies.<ref name=\"play5\"/> The plan and guidelines were public. The estimate of resources and list of issues were not public, though they were not classified and reporters have obtained them and made them public.\n\nWhile the U.S. established the [[Strategic National Stockpile]] in 2003 as an emergency repository for antibiotics, vaccines and other critical medical supplies, it has not adequately served its role in the current pandemic.<ref name=wsj-prep/> In 2017, public health represented just 2.5% of all U.S. health spending ($274 per person).\n\nIn February 2020, when there were only a dozen cases in the U.S., and before anyone had died, the CDC advised Americans to prepare for an epidemic to contain the virus before it spreads throughout the U.S. [[Nancy Messonnier]], a director at the CDC, explained that with no vaccine or treatment available, Americans must be prepared to take other precautions.<ref>[https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-epidemic-how-to-prepare.html \"A US coronavirus outbreak is almost inevitable.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

The models can incorporate mitigation measures, seasonality, randomness, and other factors that can vary during a real epidemic. Similar tests are used by the insurance industry to understand risks posed by infrequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe Trump administration simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China in 2019 and found that the U.S. government response was \"underfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated\". Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported. It led President Trump to issue an executive order to make flu vaccines more readily available and of higher quality, and he provided additional funds for the pandemic threats program in the Department of Health and Human Services ([[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]]).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Before Virus Outbreak, a Cascade of Warnings Went Unheeded|date=March 19, 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 20, 2020|last2=Lipton|first2=Eric|issn=0362-4331|last3=Sullivan|first3=Eileen|last4=Crowley|first4=Michael}}</ref> White House economists published a study in September 2019 that warned a pandemic could kill half a million Americans and devastate the economy.<ref>''[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/coronavirus-economy-trump.html White House Economists Warned in 2019 a Pandemic Could Devastate America]'' March 31, 2020 New York Times</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the WHO also ran a simulation exercise of a global pandemic response involving more than 40 countries, although the results appear to be unavailable.<ref>[https://www.who.int/ihr/eoc-exercise/en/ \"Simulation exercise puts global pandemic readiness to the test\"], World Health Organization, Dec. 3, 2018</ref>\n\n===Potential response strategies===\n\nThe NSC created a pandemic playbook (called \"Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents\") in 2016 which laid out strategies and recommendations that an administration should take, including moving swiftly to fully detect potential outbreaks, securing supplemental funding and considering invoking the [[Defense Production Act of 1950|Defense Production Act]], and making sure there are sufficient personal protective equipment available for healthcare workers.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

At the same time, the DH.84 Dragon was used to inaugurate an Aer Lingus service on the Dublin-Liverpool route.\n\nThe airline was established as the national carrier under the [[Air Navigation and Transport Act]] (1936).<ref name=\"EI\" /> In 1937, the Irish government created Aer Rianta (now called [[Dublin Airport Authority]]), a company to assume financial responsibility for the new airline and the entire country's civil aviation infrastructure. In April 1937, Aer Lingus became wholly owned by the Irish government via Aer Rianta.\n\nThe airline's first General Manager was Dr J.F. (Jeremiah known as 'Jerry') Dempsey, a chartered accountant, who joined the company on secondment from Kennedy Crowley & Co (predecessor to [[KPMG]]) as Company Secretary in 1936 (aged 30) and was appointed to the role of General Manager in 1937. He retired 30 years later in 1967 at the age of 60.\n\nIn 1938, a [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide|de Havilland DH.89 Dragon Rapide]] replaced ''Iolar'', and the company purchased a second DH.86B. Two [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Lockheed 14s]] arrived in 1939, Aer Lingus' first all-metal aircraft.\n[[File:Aer Lingus DC-3 Manchester 1949.jpg|thumb|An Aer Lingus [[Douglas DC-3]] at [[Manchester Airport]] in 1948 wearing the first postwar livery.]]\n\nIn January 1940, a new airport opened in the Dublin suburb of Collinstown and Aer Lingus moved its operations there. It purchased a new [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]] and inaugurated new services to [[Liverpool]] and an internal service to [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]]. The airline's services were curtailed during World War II with the sole route being to Liverpool or [[City Airport Manchester|Barton Aerodrome]] Manchester depending on the fluctuating security situation.\n\n=== Post-war expansion ===\nOn 9 November 1945, regular services were resumed with an inaugural flight to London. From this point Aer Lingus aircraft, initially mostly [[Douglas DC-3]]s, were painted in a silver and green livery. The airline introduced its first flight attendants.\n\nIn 1946, a new Anglo-Irish agreement gave Aer Lingus exclusive UK traffic rights from Ireland in exchange for a 40% holding by [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and [[British European Airways]] (BEA). Because of Aer Lingus' growth the airline bought seven new [[Vickers VC.1 Viking|Vickers Viking]] aircraft in 1947, however, these proved to be uneconomical and were soon sold.\n[[File:Bristol 170.31 EI-AFS Aer Lingus Ringway 08.53 edited-2.jpg|thumb|A [[Bristol 170 Freighter]] at Manchester Airport in 1953.]]\n\nIn 1947, Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann came into existence to operate [[transatlantic flight]]s to [[New York City]] from Ireland. The airline ordered five new [[Lockheed L-749 Constellation]]s, but a change of government and a financial crisis prevented the service from starting. [[John A Costello]], the incoming [[Fine Gael]] [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister), was not a keen supporter of air travel and thought that flying the Atlantic was too grandiose a scheme for a small airline from a small country like Ireland.<ref name=Garvin>{{cite book| title=Preventing the Future, Why Ireland Remained so Poor for so long| first=Tom| last=Garvin| date=13 September 2005| publisher=Gill & MacMillan, Ltd.| isbn=978-0-7171-3970-5}}</ref>\n[[File:Aer Lingus Viscount 808 Manchester 1963.jpg|thumb|A [[Vickers Viscount]] 808 in \"green top\" livery at Manchester Airport in 1963.]]\n\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s, Aer Lingus introduced routes to [[Brussels Airport|Brussels]], [[Amsterdam Airport|Amsterdam]] via [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] and to Rome. Because of the expanding route structure, the airline became one of the early purchasers of [[Vickers Viscount]] 700s in 1951, which were placed in service in April 1954. In 1952, the airline expanded its all-freight services and acquired a small fleet of [[Bristol 170 Freighter]]s, which remained in service until 1957.\n\nProf. [[Patrick Lynch (economist)|Patrick Lynch]] was appointed the chairman of Aer Lingus and [[Aer Rianta]] in 1954<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/top-irish-economist-patrick-lynch-dies-26251868.html|title=Top Irish economist Patrick Lynch dies|website=independent|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/a-force-behind-country-s-economic-growth-in-the-60s-1.337754|title=A force behind country's economic growth in the 60s|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> and served in the position until 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/entertainment/niall-pioneers-definitive-book-on-national-airline-27774134.html|title=Niall pioneers definitive book on national airline|website=independent|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> In 1956, Aer Lingus introduced a new, green-top livery with a white lightning flash down the windows and the Irish flag displayed on the fin.\n\n=== First transatlantic service ===\n[[File:Boeing 720-048 EI-ALA Aer Lingus 1965.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 720]] in Aer Lingus-Irish International livery in 1965.]]\n\nOn 28 April 1958, Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann operated its first transatlantic service from [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] to New York. Three [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation]]s were used for the twice-weekly service aboard aircraft leased from the US airline [[Seaboard World Airlines|Seaboard and Western]] with Irish cabin crews. This arrangement continued until 1 January 1960 when Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann was renamed Aer Lingus \u2013 Irish International Airlines.\n\nAer Lingus bought seven [[Fokker F27 Friendship]]s, which were delivered between November 1958 and May 1959. These were used in short-haul services to the UK, gradually replacing the Dakotas, until Aer Lingus disposed of them during 1966 in favour of secondhand Viscount 800s.\n\nThe airline entered the jet age on 14 December 1960 when it received three [[Boeing 720]] for use on the New York route and the newest Aer Lingus destination [[Boston]].\n\nIn 1963, Aer Lingus added [[Aviation Traders Carvair]]s to the fleet. These aircraft could transport five cars which were loaded into the fuselage through the nose of the aircraft. The Carvair proved to be uneconomical for the airline partly due to the rise of [[Roll-on/roll-off|auto ferry services]], and the aircraft were used for freight services until disposed of.\n\nThe Boeing 720s proved to be a success for the airline on the transatlantic routes. To supplement these, Aer Lingus took delivery of its first larger Boeing 707 in 1964, and the type continued to serve the airline until 1986.\n\n=== Jet aircraft ===\n[[File:Aer Lingus Fokker Friendship Manchester 1965.jpg|thumb|A [[Fokker F27]] Friendship at [[Manchester Airport]] in 1965. The F27 was used on short-haul services between 1958 and 1966.]]\n\nConversion of the European fleet to jet equipment began in 1965 when the [[BAC One-Eleven]] started services from Dublin and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to Paris and via [[Manchester]] to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, D\u00fcsseldorf and Frankfurt. The airline adopted a new livery in the same year, with a large green [[shamrock (Irish symbol)|shamrock]] on the fin and titles of ''Aer Lingus-Irish International'' just above the windows. In 1966, the remainder of the company's shares held by [[Dublin Airport Authority|Aer Rianta]] were transferred to the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]].\n[[File:Carvair and ambassador at bristol airport 1965 arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Aviation Traders Carvair]] that was used as a vehicle freighter is seen loading a car at [[Bristol Airport]] in 1964.]]\n\nIn 1966, the company inaugurated a route from Shannon to [[Montr\u00e9al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Montreal]] and onward to [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]]. In 1968, flights from [[Belfast]], in [[Northern Ireland]], to New York City started, however, it was soon suspended due to the beginning of [[the Troubles]]. Aer Lingus introduced [[Boeing 737]]s to its fleet in 1969 to cope with the high demand for flights between Dublin and London. Later, Aer Lingus extended the 737 flights to all of its European networks.\n\nIn 1967, after 30 years of service, General Manager Dr J.F. Dempsey signed the contract for the airline's first two [[Boeing 747]] aircraft before he retired later that year.\n\n=== 1970s to present ===\n[[File:Aer Lingus BAC 1-11 at Zurich - July 1975.jpg|thumb|A BAC One-Eleven in the old livery at [[Zurich Airport]], Switzerland in 1975.]]\nOn 6 March 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of the first of two [[Boeing 747]]s for use on the transatlantic routes.<ref>{{citation| url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1971112500009?opendocument| title=Supplementary Estimates, 1971\u201372 \u2013 Vote 41: Transport and Power| publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas| date=25 November 1971| volume=257| number=3| page=9| quote=The company took delivery of two Boeing 747s (Jumbos) in March 1971, and they went into service in April and May.

In 1974, Aer Lingus unveiled a new livery which eliminated the word ''International'' from the fuselage titles. The livery included two colours of blue and one green, plus the white shamrock on the fin.\n\nIn 1977, Aer Lingus recruited its first female pilot, [[Gr\u00e1inne Cronin]] \u2013 the airline was the second in Europe (after [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]]) to introduce female pilots.<ref name=Murray>{{cite news| url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0526/1224271143395.html |title=Permission to land first woman Aer Lingus pilot retires| work=The Irish Times| date=26 May 2010| last=Murray| first=Ken| accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1979, Aer Lingus became the first European airline other than [[Alitalia]] to be used by [[Pope John Paul II]], when he flew aboard a specially modified Boeing 747 (EI-ASI or St. Patrick) from Rome to Dublin and later from Shannon to [[Boston]]. In the early 1980s, the 707s were phased out.\n\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-CFD), Dublin, February 1993.jpg|thumb|An Aer Lingus Commuter [[Saab 340]] at [[Dublin Airport]] in 1993.]]\n\nIn 1984, the airline formed a fully owned subsidiary, Aer Lingus Commuter, so that Aer Lingus could fly to larger cities in Ireland and Britain whose flying time from Dublin did not require jet aircraft. These services employed five of the Belfast-built [[Short 360]] after conducting a trial with the [[Short 330]]. Around this time Aer Lingus purchased a majority shareholding in the [[cargo airline]] [[Aer Turas]], owner of some [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]] freighter jets.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1989, new [[Boeing 737]]s arrived to replace the older ones, and six [[Fokker 50]]s were added to the ''Commuter'' fleet. During 1990, after the passage of the deregulation act for the airline industry in Ireland, Aer Lingus reconsidered its operational policies. It retired the BAC One-Elevens and replaced them with five new 737s. In 1991, four [[Saab 340]]Bs arrived at the commuter division to replace the [[Short 360]] aircraft. By 1992, Aer Lingus's entire original 737-200 fleet had been replaced and it was now the first carrier in the world operating all three versions of the second-generation 737. These were the \u2212300, \u2212400 and \u2212500 series, although the \u2212300 did not stay long in Aer Lingus service.\n\n==== Airbus operations ====\n[[File:aerlingus.a321-200.ei-cpe.arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Airbus A321]] landing at [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 2007.]]\n\nIn 1994, Aer Lingus started direct services between Dublin and the United States using the [[Airbus A330]] and in May of that year, Aer Lingus operated the first A330-300 [[ETOPS]] service over the North Atlantic. This led to the phasing out of the [[Boeing 747]] and the briefly operated [[Boeing 767]]-300ER. On 2 October 1995, the Boeing 747 service ceased operations after twenty-five years of service. By that time, over eight million people had travelled across the Atlantic in Aer Lingus Boeing 747s. The late 1990s saw Aer Lingus return to [[Belfast]] with service to New York via Shannon.  It also added [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] as a destination, but discontinued these flights in 2001.\n\nThe first [[Airbus]] short-haul aircraft arrived in 1998 in the form of the [[Airbus A321|A321]], initially to mainly operate the Dublin-Heathrow route. Six were delivered in 1998 and 1999 and three of these continue in service today. The first [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] was delivered in 2000, with three more added to the fleet by 2001.\n\nOn 1 February 2001, Aer Lingus Commuter merged back into the mainline operation. The business was severely affected by the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]].  In response, the airline cut staff numbers and destinations and reduced its fleet.  As a result, it weathered the storm and returned to profit, largely through lowering the airline's cost base, updating the fleet with modern Airbus equipment and developing new routes to mainland European destinations. Aer Lingus had previously largely neglected mainland Europe in favour of US and British destinations.  It positioned itself as competition to the European [[no frills|no-frills]] airlines while offering intercontinental flights, phased-out Business class travel for short-haul flights, but retained cargo services on a small number of routes.\n\nA large order for A320 aircraft saw deliveries commencing in 2004 and continuing to 2011. The delivery of these aircraft allowed the withdrawal of the [[Boeing 737]].  On 29 October 2005, Aer Lingus withdrew its last two 737 aircraft from service, marking the end of Boeing aircraft at Aer Lingus, and the beginning of an all-Airbus fleet.\n\nOn 27 October 2005, Aer Lingus announced its first scheduled service to Asia from March 2006 as [[Dubai International Airport]] in the United Arab Emirates, where Chief Executive [[Dermot Mannion]] was based when at [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]].<ref name=privatise>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1027/aerlingus-business.html |title=RT\u00c9 Business: Aer Lingus must privatise in 2006: CEO |work=RT\u00c9 News |date=27 October 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> Despite the Aer Lingus press release describing it as the first long-haul service outside the United States, there had in fact been a previous service to [[Montreal]] from 1966 to 1979.

These were used to expand long-haul operations as well as replace three older models. Deliveries of the A330 began in February 2009. In, 2011 Aer Lingus switched their remaining three A330 orders to A350-900s, with delivery no sooner than 2017.

Aer Lingus explained the move stating the carrier was repositioning as a low-cost carrier, which did not fit with Oneworld's pitch to the premium international frequent flyer.\n\nOn 6 February 2007, however, the airline announced its intention to form a new alliance with [[JetBlue]]. This new alliance was to act as a weblink between the two airlines, enabling Aer Lingus customers to book JetBlue destinations from the Aer Lingus website. In 2008, it also announced an alliance with [[United Airlines]] for connecting services within the US.\n\nWith the flotation of Aer Lingus on the stock exchange, Aer Lingus had planned to expand its route network, but this was put on hold due to the economic situation.\n\n==== First Ryanair takeover bid (2006) ====\nOn 5 October 2006, Ryanair launched a bid to buy Aer Lingus. Ryanair CEO [[Michael O'Leary (Ryanair)|Michael O'Leary]] said the move was a \"unique opportunity\" to form an Irish airline. The \"new\" airline would carry over 50&nbsp;million passengers a year. Ryanair said it had bought a 16% stake in Aer Lingus and was offering \u20ac2.80 for the remaining shares, a premium over the \u20ac2.20 the shares were trading for.

Significantly, this move restored the Belfast International to [[London Heathrow Airport]] link and Aer Lingus cooperated with its codeshare partner British Airways on this route to connect with BA's network at Heathrow. To do so, the airline discontinued its [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]]-Heathrow service, a move that generated political controversy in the west of Ireland, particularly as the Shannon-London route was still profitable. The airline predicted that this move would add one million additional passengers annually.<ref name=Appeals>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0807/aerlingus-business.html |work=RT\u00c9 News |title=Ryanair appeals to Government on Shannon |date=7 August 2007 |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref name=Belfast>{{cite web |url=http://www.belfastairport.com/en/content/4/58/airlines.html |publisher=Belfast International Airport |title=Airlines |accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> The Shannon to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] service has since been reinstated.\n\nAfter five years at Belfast International Airport, Aer Lingus announced on 19 July 2012 that it would be moving its operations to [[George Best Belfast City Airport]]. The airline transferred its Belfast \u2013 London Heathrow flights to there, and also announced the operation of a thrice-daily London Gatwick service (no longer operated), and on 31 March 2013, launched services to Faro and [[M\u00e1laga]]. Aer Lingus based 2 aircraft in Belfast City Airport for the Winter 2012\u20132013 season and a third aircraft arrived for the Summer 2013 season.\n\n==== Open Skies ====\nOn 22 March 2007, as a result of the [[EU\u2013US Open Skies Agreement]], Aer Lingus announced three new long-haul services to the United States. From Autumn 2007, Aer Lingus commenced direct flights to [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], San Francisco and Washington, D.C.-[[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles]], facilitated by the arrival of two new Airbus A330 aircraft in May 2007. The airline also serves [[Boston]] ([[Logan International Airport]]), Chicago ([[O'Hare International Airport]]), and New York ([[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]]). Aer Lingus ended its Middle-Eastern Route to [[Dubai International Airport|Dubai]] in March 2008 and ended its Los Angeles route in November 2008.

The Dublin-Los Angeles route was reintroduced on 4 May 2016.\n\n==== Effects of global financial crisis ====\nAfter reporting losses of \u20ac22&nbsp;million for the first half of the year, in October 2008, Aer Lingus announced a \u20ac74&nbsp;million cost-saving plan. This was to involve up to 1,500 job cuts including the loss of cabin crew bases in Shannon and Heathrow. The plan included scaled background operations in Cork and Shannon Airports; outsourcing check-in, baggage handling, cargo and catering services in Dublin; reduction in transatlantic services and replacing staff with US-based cabin crew; and a pay freeze through the end of 2009. This met with a largely negative response particularly from trade unions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/unions-to-discuss-draconian-aer-lingus-cost-cutting-plan-380613.html |title=Unions to discuss 'draconian' Aer Lingus cost-cutting plan| work=Irish Examiner |accessdate=10 July 2015|date=7 October 2008}}</ref> These cutbacks have since been cancelled, and new cutbacks including lower pay and a change in working conditions for ground staff have been implemented.\n\nIn December 2008, Aer Lingus announced that the Shannon \u2013 Heathrow service would resume from 29 March 2009 following new arrangements with the trade unions on staff costs and the Shannon Airport Authority on airport charges.<ref>{{cite news| title=Aer Lingus resumes Shannon-Heathrow route| work=RT\u00c9 News| date=22 December 2008| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/aerlingus.html| accessdate=1 January 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225030306/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/aerlingus.html| archivedate=25 December 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> However at the end of June 2009 the company had accumulated losses of \u20ac93&nbsp;million and Chairman Colm Barrington confirmed this situation could not continue.<ref>{{cite news| title=Aer Lingus 'will look for pay cuts'| work=RT\u00c9 News| date=28 September 2009| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0828/aerlingus-business.html| accessdate=1 January 2009}}</ref> In October 2009, newly appointed Chief Executive Christoph Mueller announced a radical cost-cutting plan that would lead to the loss of 676 jobs at the company and see pay and pension reductions for those being retained.

Part of the aircraft's elevator spring tab was found some distance from the rest of the wreckage, suggesting that it had become detached at an earlier stage. However, the accident report reached no definitive conclusion about the cause of the crash but did not exclude the possibility that another aircraft or airborne object was involved. Following persistent rumours that the aircraft's demise was linked with nearby British military exercises, a review of the case files by the [[Air Accident Investigation Unit]] took place in 1998.

At the same time, the DH.84 Dragon was used to inaugurate an Aer Lingus service on the Dublin-Liverpool route.\n\nThe airline was established as the national carrier under the [[Air Navigation and Transport Act]] (1936).<ref name=\"EI\" /> In 1937, the Irish government created Aer Rianta (now called [[Dublin Airport Authority]]), a company to assume financial responsibility for the new airline and the entire country's civil aviation infrastructure. In April 1937, Aer Lingus became wholly owned by the Irish government via Aer Rianta.\n\nThe airline's first General Manager was Dr J.F. (Jeremiah known as 'Jerry') Dempsey, a chartered accountant, who joined the company on secondment from Kennedy Crowley & Co (predecessor to [[KPMG]]) as Company Secretary in 1936 (aged 30) and was appointed to the role of General Manager in 1937. He retired 30 years later in 1967 at the age of 60.\n\nIn 1938, a [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide|de Havilland DH.89 Dragon Rapide]] replaced ''Iolar'', and the company purchased a second DH.86B. Two [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Lockheed 14s]] arrived in 1939, Aer Lingus' first all-metal aircraft.\n[[File:Aer Lingus DC-3 Manchester 1949.jpg|thumb|An Aer Lingus [[Douglas DC-3]] at [[Manchester Airport]] in 1948 wearing the first postwar livery.]]\n\nIn January 1940, a new airport opened in the Dublin suburb of Collinstown and Aer Lingus moved its operations there. It purchased a new [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]] and inaugurated new services to [[Liverpool]] and an internal service to [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]]. The airline's services were curtailed during World War II with the sole route being to Liverpool or [[City Airport Manchester|Barton Aerodrome]] Manchester depending on the fluctuating security situation.\n\n=== Post-war expansion ===\nOn 9 November 1945, regular services were resumed with an inaugural flight to London. From this point Aer Lingus aircraft, initially mostly [[Douglas DC-3]]s, were painted in a silver and green livery. The airline introduced its first flight attendants.\n\nIn 1946, a new Anglo-Irish agreement gave Aer Lingus exclusive UK traffic rights from Ireland in exchange for a 40% holding by [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and [[British European Airways]] (BEA). Because of Aer Lingus' growth the airline bought seven new [[Vickers VC.1 Viking|Vickers Viking]] aircraft in 1947, however, these proved to be uneconomical and were soon sold.\n[[File:Bristol 170.31 EI-AFS Aer Lingus Ringway 08.53 edited-2.jpg|thumb|A [[Bristol 170 Freighter]] at Manchester Airport in 1953.]]\n\nIn 1947, Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann came into existence to operate [[transatlantic flight]]s to [[New York City]] from Ireland. The airline ordered five new [[Lockheed L-749 Constellation]]s, but a change of government and a financial crisis prevented the service from starting. [[John A Costello]], the incoming [[Fine Gael]] [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister), was not a keen supporter of air travel and thought that flying the Atlantic was too grandiose a scheme for a small airline from a small country like Ireland.<ref name=Garvin>{{cite book| title=Preventing the Future, Why Ireland Remained so Poor for so long| first=Tom| last=Garvin| date=13 September 2005| publisher=Gill & MacMillan, Ltd.| isbn=978-0-7171-3970-5}}</ref>\n[[File:Aer Lingus Viscount 808 Manchester 1963.jpg|thumb|A [[Vickers Viscount]] 808 in \"green top\" livery at Manchester Airport in 1963.]]\n\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s, Aer Lingus introduced routes to [[Brussels Airport|Brussels]], [[Amsterdam Airport|Amsterdam]] via [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] and to Rome. Because of the expanding route structure, the airline became one of the early purchasers of [[Vickers Viscount]] 700s in 1951, which were placed in service in April 1954. In 1952, the airline expanded its all-freight services and acquired a small fleet of [[Bristol 170 Freighter]]s, which remained in service until 1957.\n\nProf. [[Patrick Lynch (economist)|Patrick Lynch]] was appointed the chairman of Aer Lingus and [[Aer Rianta]] in 1954<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/top-irish-economist-patrick-lynch-dies-26251868.html|title=Top Irish economist Patrick Lynch dies|website=independent|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/a-force-behind-country-s-economic-growth-in-the-60s-1.337754|title=A force behind country's economic growth in the 60s|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> and served in the position until 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/entertainment/niall-pioneers-definitive-book-on-national-airline-27774134.html|title=Niall pioneers definitive book on national airline|website=independent|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> In 1956, Aer Lingus introduced a new, green-top livery with a white lightning flash down the windows and the Irish flag displayed on the fin.\n\n=== First transatlantic service ===\n[[File:Boeing 720-048 EI-ALA Aer Lingus 1965.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 720]] in Aer Lingus-Irish International livery in 1965.]]\n\nOn 28 April 1958, Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann operated its first transatlantic service from [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] to New York. Three [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation]]s were used for the twice-weekly service aboard aircraft leased from the US airline [[Seaboard World Airlines|Seaboard and Western]] with Irish cabin crews. This arrangement continued until 1 January 1960 when Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann was renamed Aer Lingus \u2013 Irish International Airlines.\n\nAer Lingus bought seven [[Fokker F27 Friendship]]s, which were delivered between November 1958 and May 1959. These were used in short-haul services to the UK, gradually replacing the Dakotas, until Aer Lingus disposed of them during 1966 in favour of secondhand Viscount 800s.\n\nThe airline entered the jet age on 14 December 1960 when it received three [[Boeing 720]] for use on the New York route and the newest Aer Lingus destination [[Boston]].\n\nIn 1963, Aer Lingus added [[Aviation Traders Carvair]]s to the fleet. These aircraft could transport five cars which were loaded into the fuselage through the nose of the aircraft. The Carvair proved to be uneconomical for the airline partly due to the rise of [[Roll-on/roll-off|auto ferry services]], and the aircraft were used for freight services until disposed of.\n\nThe Boeing 720s proved to be a success for the airline on the transatlantic routes. To supplement these, Aer Lingus took delivery of its first larger Boeing 707 in 1964, and the type continued to serve the airline until 1986.\n\n=== Jet aircraft ===\n[[File:Aer Lingus Fokker Friendship Manchester 1965.jpg|thumb|A [[Fokker F27]] Friendship at [[Manchester Airport]] in 1965. The F27 was used on short-haul services between 1958 and 1966.]]\n\nConversion of the European fleet to jet equipment began in 1965 when the [[BAC One-Eleven]] started services from Dublin and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to Paris and via [[Manchester]] to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, D\u00fcsseldorf and Frankfurt. The airline adopted a new livery in the same year, with a large green [[shamrock (Irish symbol)|shamrock]] on the fin and titles of ''Aer Lingus-Irish International'' just above the windows. In 1966, the remainder of the company's shares held by [[Dublin Airport Authority|Aer Rianta]] were transferred to the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]].\n[[File:Carvair and ambassador at bristol airport 1965 arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Aviation Traders Carvair]] that was used as a vehicle freighter is seen loading a car at [[Bristol Airport]] in 1964.]]\n\nIn 1966, the company inaugurated a route from Shannon to [[Montr\u00e9al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Montreal]] and onward to [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]]. In 1968, flights from [[Belfast]], in [[Northern Ireland]], to New York City started, however, it was soon suspended due to the beginning of [[the Troubles]]. Aer Lingus introduced [[Boeing 737]]s to its fleet in 1969 to cope with the high demand for flights between Dublin and London. Later, Aer Lingus extended the 737 flights to all of its European networks.\n\nIn 1967, after 30 years of service, General Manager Dr J.F. Dempsey signed the contract for the airline's first two [[Boeing 747]] aircraft before he retired later that year.\n\n=== 1970s to present ===\n[[File:Aer Lingus BAC 1-11 at Zurich - July 1975.jpg|thumb|A BAC One-Eleven in the old livery at [[Zurich Airport]], Switzerland in 1975.]]\nOn 6 March 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of the first of two [[Boeing 747]]s for use on the transatlantic routes.<ref>{{citation| url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1971112500009?opendocument| title=Supplementary Estimates, 1971\u201372 \u2013 Vote 41: Transport and Power| publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas| date=25 November 1971| volume=257| number=3| page=9| quote=The company took delivery of two Boeing 747s (Jumbos) in March 1971, and they went into service in April and May.

In 1974, Aer Lingus unveiled a new livery which eliminated the word ''International'' from the fuselage titles. The livery included two colours of blue and one green, plus the white shamrock on the fin.\n\nIn 1977, Aer Lingus recruited its first female pilot, [[Gr\u00e1inne Cronin]] \u2013 the airline was the second in Europe (after [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]]) to introduce female pilots.<ref name=Murray>{{cite news| url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0526/1224271143395.html |title=Permission to land first woman Aer Lingus pilot retires| work=The Irish Times| date=26 May 2010| last=Murray| first=Ken| accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1979, Aer Lingus became the first European airline other than [[Alitalia]] to be used by [[Pope John Paul II]], when he flew aboard a specially modified Boeing 747 (EI-ASI or St. Patrick) from Rome to Dublin and later from Shannon to [[Boston]]. In the early 1980s, the 707s were phased out.\n\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-CFD), Dublin, February 1993.jpg|thumb|An Aer Lingus Commuter [[Saab 340]] at [[Dublin Airport]] in 1993.]]\n\nIn 1984, the airline formed a fully owned subsidiary, Aer Lingus Commuter, so that Aer Lingus could fly to larger cities in Ireland and Britain whose flying time from Dublin did not require jet aircraft. These services employed five of the Belfast-built [[Short 360]] after conducting a trial with the [[Short 330]]. Around this time Aer Lingus purchased a majority shareholding in the [[cargo airline]] [[Aer Turas]], owner of some [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]] freighter jets.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1989, new [[Boeing 737]]s arrived to replace the older ones, and six [[Fokker 50]]s were added to the ''Commuter'' fleet. During 1990, after the passage of the deregulation act for the airline industry in Ireland, Aer Lingus reconsidered its operational policies. It retired the BAC One-Elevens and replaced them with five new 737s. In 1991, four [[Saab 340]]Bs arrived at the commuter division to replace the [[Short 360]] aircraft. By 1992, Aer Lingus's entire original 737-200 fleet had been replaced and it was now the first carrier in the world operating all three versions of the second-generation 737. These were the \u2212300, \u2212400 and \u2212500 series, although the \u2212300 did not stay long in Aer Lingus service.\n\n==== Airbus operations ====\n[[File:aerlingus.a321-200.ei-cpe.arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Airbus A321]] landing at [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 2007.]]\n\nIn 1994, Aer Lingus started direct services between Dublin and the United States using the [[Airbus A330]] and in May of that year, Aer Lingus operated the first A330-300 [[ETOPS]] service over the North Atlantic. This led to the phasing out of the [[Boeing 747]] and the briefly operated [[Boeing 767]]-300ER. On 2 October 1995, the Boeing 747 service ceased operations after twenty-five years of service. By that time, over eight million people had travelled across the Atlantic in Aer Lingus Boeing 747s. The late 1990s saw Aer Lingus return to [[Belfast]] with service to New York via Shannon.  It also added [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] as a destination, but discontinued these flights in 2001.\n\nThe first [[Airbus]] short-haul aircraft arrived in 1998 in the form of the [[Airbus A321|A321]], initially to mainly operate the Dublin-Heathrow route. Six were delivered in 1998 and 1999 and three of these continue in service today. The first [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] was delivered in 2000, with three more added to the fleet by 2001.\n\nOn 1 February 2001, Aer Lingus Commuter merged back into the mainline operation. The business was severely affected by the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]].  In response, the airline cut staff numbers and destinations and reduced its fleet.  As a result, it weathered the storm and returned to profit, largely through lowering the airline's cost base, updating the fleet with modern Airbus equipment and developing new routes to mainland European destinations. Aer Lingus had previously largely neglected mainland Europe in favour of US and British destinations.  It positioned itself as competition to the European [[no frills|no-frills]] airlines while offering intercontinental flights, phased-out Business class travel for short-haul flights, but retained cargo services on a small number of routes.\n\nA large order for A320 aircraft saw deliveries commencing in 2004 and continuing to 2011. The delivery of these aircraft allowed the withdrawal of the [[Boeing 737]].  On 29 October 2005, Aer Lingus withdrew its last two 737 aircraft from service, marking the end of Boeing aircraft at Aer Lingus, and the beginning of an all-Airbus fleet.\n\nOn 27 October 2005, Aer Lingus announced its first scheduled service to Asia from March 2006 as [[Dubai International Airport]] in the United Arab Emirates, where Chief Executive [[Dermot Mannion]] was based when at [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]].<ref name=privatise>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1027/aerlingus-business.html |title=RT\u00c9 Business: Aer Lingus must privatise in 2006: CEO |work=RT\u00c9 News |date=27 October 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> Despite the Aer Lingus press release describing it as the first long-haul service outside the United States, there had in fact been a previous service to [[Montreal]] from 1966 to 1979.

These were used to expand long-haul operations as well as replace three older models. Deliveries of the A330 began in February 2009. In, 2011 Aer Lingus switched their remaining three A330 orders to A350-900s, with delivery no sooner than 2017.

Services from Belfast International commenced in December 2007. {{as of|2008|July}}, the airline had three [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] aircraft based at the airport, serving eleven European destinations. Significantly, this move restored the Belfast International to [[London Heathrow Airport]] link and Aer Lingus cooperated with its codeshare partner British Airways on this route to connect with BA's network at Heathrow. To do so, the airline discontinued its [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]]-Heathrow service, a move that generated political controversy in the west of Ireland, particularly as the Shannon-London route was still profitable. The airline predicted that this move would add one million additional passengers annually.<ref name=Appeals>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0807/aerlingus-business.html |work=RT\u00c9 News |title=Ryanair appeals to Government on Shannon |date=7 August 2007 |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref name=Belfast>{{cite web |url=http://www.belfastairport.com/en/content/4/58/airlines.html |publisher=Belfast International Airport |title=Airlines |accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> The Shannon to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] service has since been reinstated.\n\nAfter five years at Belfast International Airport, Aer Lingus announced on 19 July 2012 that it would be moving its operations to [[George Best Belfast City Airport]]. The airline transferred its Belfast \u2013 London Heathrow flights to there, and also announced the operation of a thrice-daily London Gatwick service (no longer operated), and on 31 March 2013, launched services to Faro and [[M\u00e1laga]]. Aer Lingus based 2 aircraft in Belfast City Airport for the Winter 2012\u20132013 season and a third aircraft arrived for the Summer 2013 season.\n\n==== Open Skies ====\nOn 22 March 2007, as a result of the [[EU\u2013US Open Skies Agreement]], Aer Lingus announced three new long-haul services to the United States. From Autumn 2007, Aer Lingus commenced direct flights to [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], San Francisco and Washington, D.C.-[[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles]], facilitated by the arrival of two new Airbus A330 aircraft in May 2007. The airline also serves [[Boston]] ([[Logan International Airport]]), Chicago ([[O'Hare International Airport]]), and New York ([[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]]). Aer Lingus ended its Middle-Eastern Route to [[Dubai International Airport|Dubai]] in March 2008 and ended its Los Angeles route in November 2008. The [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and the San Francisco routes were discontinued {{as of|2009|October|24|lc=y}}. Services from Washington, D.C. resumed on 28 March 2010 when the airline began flights from Washington D.C. to [[Madrid-Barajas Airport|Madrid]], Spain in a joint venture with United Airlines.

The Dublin-Los Angeles route was reintroduced on 4 May 2016.\n\n==== Effects of global financial crisis ====\nAfter reporting losses of \u20ac22&nbsp;million for the first half of the year, in October 2008, Aer Lingus announced a \u20ac74&nbsp;million cost-saving plan. This was to involve up to 1,500 job cuts including the loss of cabin crew bases in Shannon and Heathrow. The plan included scaled background operations in Cork and Shannon Airports; outsourcing check-in, baggage handling, cargo and catering services in Dublin; reduction in transatlantic services and replacing staff with US-based cabin crew; and a pay freeze through the end of 2009. This met with a largely negative response particularly from trade unions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/unions-to-discuss-draconian-aer-lingus-cost-cutting-plan-380613.html |title=Unions to discuss 'draconian' Aer Lingus cost-cutting plan| work=Irish Examiner |accessdate=10 July 2015|date=7 October 2008}}</ref> These cutbacks have since been cancelled, and new cutbacks including lower pay and a change in working conditions for ground staff have been implemented.\n\nIn December 2008, Aer Lingus announced that the Shannon \u2013 Heathrow service would resume from 29 March 2009 following new arrangements with the trade unions on staff costs and the Shannon Airport Authority on airport charges.<ref>{{cite news| title=Aer Lingus resumes Shannon-Heathrow route| work=RT\u00c9 News| date=22 December 2008| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/aerlingus.html| accessdate=1 January 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225030306/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/aerlingus.html| archivedate=25 December 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> However at the end of June 2009 the company had accumulated losses of \u20ac93&nbsp;million and Chairman Colm Barrington confirmed this situation could not continue.<ref>{{cite news| title=Aer Lingus 'will look for pay cuts'| work=RT\u00c9 News| date=28 September 2009| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0828/aerlingus-business.html| accessdate=1 January 2009}}</ref> In October 2009, newly appointed Chief Executive Christoph Mueller announced a radical cost-cutting plan that would lead to the loss of 676 jobs at the company and see pay and pension reductions for those being retained.

Part of the aircraft's elevator spring tab was found some distance from the rest of the wreckage, suggesting that it had become detached at an earlier stage. However, the accident report reached no definitive conclusion about the cause of the crash but did not exclude the possibility that another aircraft or airborne object was involved.

She spotted a market where she began to make her own. A key ingredient of the cream, [[lanolin]], was readily at hand.\n\n[[Coleraine, Victoria|Coleraine]], in the Western Victoria region, where her uncle was a shopkeeper, might have been an \"awful place\" but was home to some 75 million [[sheep]] that secreted abundant quantities of [[lanolin]]. These sheep were the wealth of the nation and the Western District's vast mobs of merinos produced the finest wool in the land. To disguise the lanolin's pungent odour, Rubinstein experimented with [[lavender]], [[pine]] bark and [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]].\n\nRubinstein had a falling out with her uncle, but after a stint as a bush governess began waitressing at the Winter Garden tearooms in [[Melbourne]]. There, she found an admirer willing to stump up the funds to launch her Cr\u00e8me Valaze, supposedly including herbs imported \"from the [[Carpathian Mountains]]\". Costing ten pence and selling for six shillings. Known to her customers only as Helena, Rubinstein could soon afford to open a salon in fashionable [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], selling glamour as a science to customers whose skin was \"diagnosed\" and a suitable treatment \"prescribed\".\n\nSydney was next, and within five years Australian operations were profitable enough to finance a Salon de Beaut\u00e9 Valaze in [[London]]. As such, Rubinstein formed one of the world's first cosmetic companies. Her business enterprise proved immensely successful and later in life, she used her enormous wealth to support charitable institutions in the fields of education, art and health.\n\nRubinstein rapidly expanded her operation. In 1908, her sister Ceska assumed the Melbourne shop's operation, when, with $100,000, Rubinstein moved to London and began what was to become an international enterprise. (Women at this time could not obtain bank loans, so the money was her own.)\n\n==Marriage and children - London and Paris==\nIn 1908, she married the Polish-born American journalist Edward William Titus in London.  They had two sons, Roy Valentine Titus (London, December 12, 1909 \u2013 New York, June 18, 1989) and Horace Titus (London, April 23, 1912 \u2013 New York, May 18, 1958).  They eventually moved to Paris where she opened a salon in 1912.  Her husband helped with writing the [[publicity]] and set up a small publishing house, published ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' and hired [[Samuel Putnam]] to translate famous model [[Alice Prin|Kiki]]'s memoirs.\n\nRubinstein threw lavish dinner parties and became known for apocryphal quips, such as when an intoxicated French ambassador expressed vitriol toward [[Edith Sitwell]] and her brother [[Sacheverell Sitwell|Sacheverell]]: \"Vos anc\u00eatres ont br\u00fbl\u00e9 Jeanne d'Arc!\" Rubinstein, who knew little French, asked a guest what the ambassador had said. \"He said, 'Your ancestors burned [[Joan of Arc]].'\"  Rubinstein replied, \"Well, someone had to do it.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Higgins|first=Patrick |title=''Madame: An Intimate Biography of Helena Rubinstein''|publisher=Viking Press|year=1971|pages= 17}}</ref>\n\nAt another ''f\u00eate'', [[Marcel Proust]] asked her what makeup a duchess might wear.  She summarily dismissed him because \"he smelt of mothballs.\" Rubinstein recollected later, \"How was I to know he was going to be famous?\"<ref name=\"city-journal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/14_3_urbanities-czarinas.html|title=''The Czarinas of Beauty''|last=Kanfer|first=Stefan |publisher=city-journal.org|accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref>\n\n==Move to the United States==\n[[File:Helena Rubinstein by Paul C\u00e9sar Helleu (1859-1927) cropped.jpg|thumb|Helena Rubinstein by [[Paul C\u00e9sar Helleu]] (1908)]]\n[[File:Helena Rubinstein Tel Aviv Museum 1959.jpg|thumb|Helena Rubinstein 1959 [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]], she and Titus moved to [[New York City]], where she opened a cosmetics salon in 1915, the forerunner of a chain throughout the country. Helena opened up the boundless American market, and she skillfully used it, despite the serious competitors and the face of Elizabeth Arden and Charles Revson . This was the beginning of her vicious rivalry with another notable woman of the cosmetics industry, [[Elizabeth Arden]]. Both Rubinstein and Arden, who died within 18 months of each other, were social climbers. They were both keenly aware of effective marketing and luxurious packaging, the attraction of beauticians in neat uniforms, the value of celebrity endorsements, the perceived [[Value-based pricing|value of overpricing]] and the promotion of the [[pseudoscience]] of skincare. The rivalry with Arden lasted all her life, they were too similar and went towards the same goals the same way. Rubinstein said of her rival, ''\"With her packaging and my product, we could have ruled the world.\"'' <ref>http://www.pbs.org/program/powder-and-the-glory/</ref>\n\nFrom 1917, Rubinstein took on the manufacturing and wholesale distribution of her products. The \"Day of Beauty\" in the various salons became a great success. The purported portrait of Rubinstein in her advertising was of a middle-age mannequin with a [[Gentile]] appearance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1928, she sold the American business to [[Lehman Brothers]] for $7.3 million, ($88 million in 2007). After the arrival of the [[Great Depression]], she bought back the nearly worthless stock for less than $1 million and eventually turned the shares into values of multimillion dollars,{{Vague|date=March 2020}} establishing salons and outlets in almost a dozen US cities. This saga, and Rubinstein's early business career, has been the subject of a recent Harvard Business School case.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-helena-rubinstein-used-tall-tales-to-turn-cosmetics-into-a-luxury-brand| title=Geoff Jones |publisher=Working Knowledge |accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref> Her subsequent spa at 715 Fifth Avenue included a restaurant, a gymnasium and rugs by painter [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. She commissioned artist [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] to design a powder compact as well a portrait of herself.\n\n===Divorce and remarriage===\nFreed of her former marriage vows, in 1938 Helena readily married Prince [[Artchil Gourielli-Tchkonia]] (sometimes spelled Courielli-Tchkonia; born in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], February 18, 1895, died in [[New York City]] November 21, 1955), whose somewhat clouded matrilinear claim to [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] nobility, stemmed from his having been born a member of the untitled noble Tchkonia family of [[Guria]], enticing the ambitious young man to appropriate the genuine title of his grandmother, born Princess Gourielli.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nGourielli-Tchkonia was 23 years younger than Rubinstein.  Eager for a regal title, Rubinstein pursued the handsome youth avidly, coming to name a male cosmetics line after her youthful prized catch.  Some have claimed that the marriage was a marketing ploy, including Rubinstein's being able to pass herself off as Helena Princess Gourielli.<ref>''Mrs. Astor and the Gilded Age''</ref>\n\nRubinstein took a packed lunch to work and was frugal in many matters, but bought top-fashion clothing and valuable fine art and furniture. She founded the Helena Rubinstein Pavilion of Contemporary Art in [[Tel Aviv]] and in 1957 she established the Helena Rubinstein travelling art scholarship in Australia.<ref name=\"adb\">{{cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110484b.htm|title=Rubinstein, Helena (1870\u20131965)|last=Poynter|first=J.

She also pioneered the use of pseudo-science in marketing, donning a lab coat in many advertisements, despite the fact that her only training had been a two-month tour of European skin-care facilities.

She spotted a market where she began to make her own. A key ingredient of the cream, [[lanolin]], was readily at hand.\n\n[[Coleraine, Victoria|Coleraine]], in the Western Victoria region, where her uncle was a shopkeeper, might have been an \"awful place\" but was home to some 75 million [[sheep]] that secreted abundant quantities of [[lanolin]]. These sheep were the wealth of the nation and the Western District's vast mobs of merinos produced the finest wool in the land. To disguise the lanolin's pungent odour, Rubinstein experimented with [[lavender]], [[pine]] bark and [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]].\n\nRubinstein had a falling out with her uncle, but after a stint as a bush governess began waitressing at the Winter Garden tearooms in [[Melbourne]]. There, she found an admirer willing to stump up the funds to launch her Cr\u00e8me Valaze, supposedly including herbs imported \"from the [[Carpathian Mountains]]\". Costing ten pence and selling for six shillings. Known to her customers only as Helena, Rubinstein could soon afford to open a salon in fashionable [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], selling glamour as a science to customers whose skin was \"diagnosed\" and a suitable treatment \"prescribed\".\n\nSydney was next, and within five years Australian operations were profitable enough to finance a Salon de Beaut\u00e9 Valaze in [[London]]. As such, Rubinstein formed one of the world's first cosmetic companies. Her business enterprise proved immensely successful and later in life, she used her enormous wealth to support charitable institutions in the fields of education, art and health.\n\nRubinstein rapidly expanded her operation. In 1908, her sister Ceska assumed the Melbourne shop's operation, when, with $100,000, Rubinstein moved to London and began what was to become an international enterprise. (Women at this time could not obtain bank loans, so the money was her own.)\n\n==Marriage and children - London and Paris==\nIn 1908, she married the Polish-born American journalist Edward William Titus in London.  They had two sons, Roy Valentine Titus (London, December 12, 1909 \u2013 New York, June 18, 1989) and Horace Titus (London, April 23, 1912 \u2013 New York, May 18, 1958).  They eventually moved to Paris where she opened a salon in 1912.  Her husband helped with writing the [[publicity]] and set up a small publishing house, published ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' and hired [[Samuel Putnam]] to translate famous model [[Alice Prin|Kiki]]'s memoirs.\n\nRubinstein threw lavish dinner parties and became known for apocryphal quips, such as when an intoxicated French ambassador expressed vitriol toward [[Edith Sitwell]] and her brother [[Sacheverell Sitwell|Sacheverell]]: \"Vos anc\u00eatres ont br\u00fbl\u00e9 Jeanne d'Arc!\" Rubinstein, who knew little French, asked a guest what the ambassador had said. \"He said, 'Your ancestors burned [[Joan of Arc]].'\"  Rubinstein replied, \"Well, someone had to do it.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Higgins|first=Patrick |title=''Madame: An Intimate Biography of Helena Rubinstein''|publisher=Viking Press|year=1971|pages= 17}}</ref>\n\nAt another ''f\u00eate'', [[Marcel Proust]] asked her what makeup a duchess might wear.

Helena opened up the boundless American market, and she skillfully used it, despite the serious competitors and the face of Elizabeth Arden and Charles Revson . This was the beginning of her vicious rivalry with another notable woman of the cosmetics industry, [[Elizabeth Arden]]. Both Rubinstein and Arden, who died within 18 months of each other, were social climbers. They were both keenly aware of effective marketing and luxurious packaging, the attraction of beauticians in neat uniforms, the value of celebrity endorsements, the perceived [[Value-based pricing|value of overpricing]] and the promotion of the [[pseudoscience]] of skincare. The rivalry with Arden lasted all her life, they were too similar and went towards the same goals the same way. Rubinstein said of her rival, ''\"With her packaging and my product, we could have ruled the world.\"'' <ref>http://www.pbs.org/program/powder-and-the-glory/</ref>\n\nFrom 1917, Rubinstein took on the manufacturing and wholesale distribution of her products. The \"Day of Beauty\" in the various salons became a great success. The purported portrait of Rubinstein in her advertising was of a middle-age mannequin with a [[Gentile]] appearance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1928, she sold the American business to [[Lehman Brothers]] for $7.3 million, ($88 million in 2007). After the arrival of the [[Great Depression]], she bought back the nearly worthless stock for less than $1 million and eventually turned the shares into values of multimillion dollars,{{Vague|date=March 2020}} establishing salons and outlets in almost a dozen US cities. This saga, and Rubinstein's early business career, has been the subject of a recent Harvard Business School case.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-helena-rubinstein-used-tall-tales-to-turn-cosmetics-into-a-luxury-brand| title=Geoff Jones |publisher=Working Knowledge |accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref> Her subsequent spa at 715 Fifth Avenue included a restaurant, a gymnasium and rugs by painter [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. She commissioned artist [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] to design a powder compact as well a portrait of herself.\n\n===Divorce and remarriage===\nFreed of her former marriage vows, in 1938 Helena readily married Prince [[Artchil Gourielli-Tchkonia]] (sometimes spelled Courielli-Tchkonia; born in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], February 18, 1895, died in [[New York City]] November 21, 1955), whose somewhat clouded matrilinear claim to [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] nobility, stemmed from his having been born a member of the untitled noble Tchkonia family of [[Guria]], enticing the ambitious young man to appropriate the genuine title of his grandmother, born Princess Gourielli.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nGourielli-Tchkonia was 23 years younger than Rubinstein.  Eager for a regal title, Rubinstein pursued the handsome youth avidly, coming to name a male cosmetics line after her youthful prized catch.  Some have claimed that the marriage was a marketing ploy, including Rubinstein's being able to pass herself off as Helena Princess Gourielli.<ref>''Mrs. Astor and the Gilded Age''</ref>\n\nRubinstein took a packed lunch to work and was frugal in many matters, but bought top-fashion clothing and valuable fine art and furniture.
