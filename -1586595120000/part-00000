It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

A trademark may be eligible for registration, or '''registrable''', if it performs the essential trademark function, and has '''distinctive character'''. Registrability can be understood as a continuum, with \"inherently distinctive\" marks at one end, \"generic\" and \"descriptive\" marks with no distinctive character at the other end, and \"suggestive\" and \"arbitrary\" marks lying between these two points. \"Descriptive\" marks must acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning\u2014consumers have come to recognize the mark as a source indicator\u2014to be protectable.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Battersby, Gregory J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51098248|title=Trademark & copyright disputes : litigation forms and analysis|date=2003-|publisher=Aspen Publishers|others=Grimes, Charles W.|isbn=0-7355-3515-9|location=New York, NY|oclc=51098248}}</ref> \"Generic\" terms are used to refer to the product or service itself and cannot be used as trademarks.\n\n==The spectrum of distinctiveness==\n\nIn [[United States trademark law]], [[Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v.

Courts often speak of marks falling along the following \"'''spectrum of distinctiveness''',\" also known within the US as the \"[[Abercrombie & Fitch|Abercrombie]] classification\" or \"Abercrombie factors\":<ref>''[[Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v.

Invented marks are [[neologism]]s which will not previously have been found in any [[dictionary]].\n\n===Arbitrary marks===\nAn '''arbitrary''' trademark is usually a common word which is used in a meaningless context (e.g. \"[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]\" for computers). Such marks consist of words or images which have some dictionary meaning before being adopted as trademarks, but which are used in connection with products or services unrelated to that dictionary meaning. Arbitrary marks are also immediately eligible for registration. ''Salty'' would be an arbitrary mark if it used in connection with e.g. telephones such as in ''Salty Telephones'', as the term \"[[salt]]\" has no particular connection with such products.\n\n===Suggestive marks===\nA '''suggestive''' mark tends to indicate the nature, quality, or a characteristic of the products or services in relation to which it is used, but does not describe this characteristic, and requires imagination on the part of the consumer to identify the characteristic. Suggestive marks invoke the consumer\u2019s perceptive imagination. An example of a suggestive mark is [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], a new technology of high-capacity data storage that utilizes a \"blue\" (actually [[Violet (color)|violet]]) [[laser]].\n\n===Descriptive marks===\nA '''descriptive''' mark is a term with a dictionary meaning which is used in connection with products or services directly related to that meaning.<ref name=\":0\" /> An example might be ''Salty'' used in connection with saltine crackers or anchovies. Such terms are not registrable unless it can be shown that distinctive character has been established in the term through extensive use in the [[marketplace]] (see further below). [[Lektronic]] was famously refused protection by the USPTO on the grounds of being descriptive for electronic goods.\n\n===Generic terms===\n{{Redirect|Generic term|other possible uses and contexts|Generic (disambiguation){{!}}Generic}}\nA '''generic term''' is the common name for the products or services in connection with which it is used, such as \"salt\" when used in connection with sodium chloride. A generic term is not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing the products or services of a business from the products or services of other businesses, and therefore cannot be afforded any legal protection.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is because there has to be some term which may generally be used by anyone\u2014including other manufacturers\u2014to refer to a product without using some organization's proprietary trademark. Marks which become generic after losing distinctive character are known as [[genericized trademark]]s. Marks which are a misspelling of a generic term (e.g., the elimination of a space) do not change the generic significance of the term.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/other/2005/76219917.pdf|title= In re NetEnterprise, Inc., Serial No. 76219917|work=USPTO|language=en|date=2005-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thettablog.blogspot.com/2005/05/netenterprise-generic-for-internet.html|title='NETENTERPRISE' Generic For An Internet Business, Says TTAB|work=TTABlog|language=en|date=2005-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessing distinctiveness==\nIn trademark litigation, courts are most frequently asked to distinguish between ''suggestive'' and ''descriptive'' marks on the one hand, and between ''descriptive'' and ''generic'' marks on the other. This is because suggestive marks, like fanciful and arbitrary marks, are presumed to be entitled to trademark protection, while descriptive marks are entitled to protection if they have become known as representing the producer of the goods, and generic marks can never receive protection. It can be seen from the examples above that the distinctive character of a term is closely related to the products or services in relation to which the term is used.\n\nA general method for assessing the distinctive character of a mark is to consider a consumer's reaction to a mark.<ref name=\":0\" /> The mark may only be inherently registrable if the consumer has never encountered the mark before. On the other hand, the mark is unlikely to be inherently registrable if it informs him about any characteristic of the relevant products or services (e.g. whether they are delicious, large, spicy, black, or sweet, in the case of fruit). In any other case the mark may not be registrable.\n\nAnother example of a descriptive mark would be a geographical word or phrase that merely indicates the origin of the product or service. For example, [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] based [[ice cream]] might find that the name \"Houston ice cream\" is denied trademark protection on the grounds that the word Houston is merely descriptive. However, they might have better luck with the name \"North Pole ice cream\". In the latter case, although North Pole is a geographical location, the ice cream is not actually made at the [[North Pole]], and no reasonable person would assume that the phrase North Pole is literally descriptive.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.findlaw.com/12international/countries/nz/articles/482.html| publisher= Findlaw|title=Trading on a good name| first=Baldwin Shelston| last= Waters|author2=Angela Sutton |date=July 2001}}</ref>\n\nTherefore marks that identify or describe a product or service, or that are in common use, or that are used as [[geographical indication]]s, generally cannot be registered as trademarks, and remain in the [[public domain]] for use by anyone.<ref name=\":0\" /> For example, a generic term such as \"apple\", or descriptive terms such as \"red\" or \"juicy\" could not be registered in relation to apples.\n\nPrimary consideration in the selection and use of trademarks should be given to marks which are inherently distinctive, as they possess the strongest distinctive character and do not require evidence of use to establish acquired distinctiveness. A fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive term can be inherently distinctive and registrable without proof of acquired distinctiveness.\nAlthough these categories are most easily applied in relation to trademarks comprising words, the same general principles are applied in relation to all kinds of trademarks. For example, a pine tree shape is descriptive when used on pine-scented products.\n\n===Acquired distinctiveness===\nA trademark with no distinctive character (i.e. a mark which is not inherently distinctive) is [[prima facie]] unregistrable.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Great Britain. Patent Office.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2647046|title=A century of trade marks : a commentary on the work and history of the Trade Marks Registry, which celebrates its centenary in 1976|date=1976|publisher=H.M.S.O|others=Moorby, R. L., Myall, D. G. A., Dyer, F. J. Ward.|isbn=0-11-511719-9|location=London|oclc=2647046}}</ref> However, most jurisdictions may still allow such marks to be registered if the trademark owner can demonstrate, typically by reference to '''evidence of use''', that consumers in the marketplace exclusively associate the mark, as used on the identified goods or in connection with the identified services, with a particular commercial origin or source (i.e. the trademark owner). \"Use\" may include authorized use by a licensee or other party. If the trade mark office is satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that a mark has \"acquired\" distinctive character ''as a [[de facto|matter of fact]]'', then the mark may be accepted for registration on the basis of '''acquired distinctiveness'''.\n\nThe nature and extent of acceptable evidence of use varies between jurisdictions, although the most useful evidence usually includes sales figures, details of advertising and promotional expenditure, and examples of promotional material. Consumer surveys may also help establish that consumers chiefly associate an otherwise non-distinctive mark with the trademark owner and its products or services. Generally, evidence of use may only be acceptable or relevant if it covers a certain period of time (e.g. three years prior to the filing date of the trademark application) and originates from within the jurisdiction where registration is sought.\n\nThe terminology of acquired distinctiveness is accepted in the [[European Union]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions such as [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and the common law jurisdiction of the [[United States]] (which also uses the term '''secondary meaning'''). In the U.S., if a trademark has been used for a continuous period of at least five years after the date of registration, the right to use the mark and the registration may become \"incontestable\" (e.g. invulnerable to cancellation for non-use, but not for becoming [[Genericized trademark|generic]]). In such cases the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] checks and confirms whether the request for incontestability meets formality requirements, but whether a registration is incontestable at law can only be determined during legal proceedings involving the registration.\n\nThe essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services, such that a trademark, properly called, indicates source or serves as a badge of origin. The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use. Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark, which can be enforced by way of an action for trademark infringement, while unregistered trademark rights may be enforced pursuant to the common law tort of [[passing off]].\n\nTrademark rights generally arise out of the use and/or registration (see below) of a mark in connection only with a specific type or range of products or services. Although it may sometimes be possible to take legal action to prevent the use of a mark in relation to products or services outside this range (e.g. for passing off), this does not mean that trademark law prevents the use of that mark by the general public. A common word, phrase, or other sign can only be removed from the public domain to the extent that a trademark owner is able to maintain exclusive rights over that sign in relation to certain products or services, assuming there are no other trademark objections. For a case study in both concepts, see ''[[Apple Corps v Apple Computer]].''\n\n===Maintaining distinctiveness===\nIf a court rules that a trademark has become \"[[genericized trademark|generic]]\" through common use (such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it), the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor example, the [[Bayer]] company's trademark \"[[Aspirin]]\" has been ruled generic in the United States, so other companies may use that name for [[acetylsalicylic acid]] as well (although it is still a trademark in [[Canada]]). [[Xerox]] for photocopiers and [[Band-Aid]] for adhesive bandages are both trademarks which are at risk of succumbing to death by becoming declared generic in certain countries, something that the respective trademark owners actively seek to prevent. In order to prevent marks becoming generic, trademark owners often contact those who appear to be using the trademark incorrectly, from web page authors to dictionary editors, and request that they cease the improper usage.\n\nThe proper use of a trademark means using the mark as an [[adjective]], not as a [[noun]] or a [[verb]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.inta.org/index.php?option=com_simplefaq&task=display&Itemid=60&catid=284&page=1&getcontent=1#FAQ75| publisher=[[International Trademark Association]]| title= How Do I Use a Trademark Properly?| work=Information and Publishing FAQ| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.3com.com/corpinfo/en_US/legal/trademark/prop_usage_tmb.html#1| title=Always Use a Trademark as an Adjective, Followed by the Appropriate Noun Descriptor(s)| publisher=3Com Legal| work=Trademarks and Brands| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html| title=Permissions and trademark guidelines| publisher=Adobe| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000943.html | title=A Guide to Proper Trademark Use | author=Pullum, Geoffrey K.  | accessdate=2006-12-05 | work= }}</ref> though for certain trademarks, use as nouns and, less commonly, verbs is common. For example, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] sent e-mails to many web authors using the term \"[[photoshopped]]\" telling them that they should only use the term \"modified by Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae software.\"  Xerox has also purchased print advertisements declaring that \"you cannot 'xerox' a document, but you can copy it on a Xerox Brand copying on machine.\" Another popular example is the use of the word \"[[frappuccino]]\" by [[Starbucks]] customers to mean any blended coffee beverage, though employees are instructed to only say \"frappuccino blended coffee\" or \"frappuccino blended cream\" when referring to such drinks. This rule is not hard-and-fast, however; for example, Lexis-Nexis has a U.S. trademark registration for \"Shepardize,\" [http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=74120780 Reg. No. 1743711], and defines \"Shepardizing on a web page as \"the process of looking up citations\" in \"a series of books called Shepard's Citations.\"<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-09-12|title=Farewell to Zimmerman\u2019s Research Guide|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/infopro/keeping-current/b/weblog/archive/2015/12/10/farewell-to-zimmerman-s-research-guide.aspx|website=www.lexisnexis.com}}</ref> Such efforts may or may not be successful in preventing genericism in the long run, which depends less on the mark owner's efforts and more on how the public actually perceives and uses the mark. In fact, legally it is more important that the trademark holder visibly and actively seems to attempt to prevent its trademark from becoming generic, regardless of real success.{{cn|date=January 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ghost mark]]s\n* [[:wikt:Transwiki:Glossary of legal terms in technology|Glossary of legal terms in technology]]\n* [[International Trademark Association]]\n* [[Madrid system]]\n* [[Proper adjective]]\n* [[Service mark]]s\n* [[Trade dress]]\n* [[Trademark attorney]]\n* [[Trademark dilution]]\n* [[Unregistered trademark]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|trademark}}\n{{Wikibooks|US Trademark Law}}\n* Canadian Trademark Law [https://web.archive.org/web/20080918044116/http://www.crollco.com/FAQs.php FAQ]\n\n{{Trademark law}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trademark Distinctiveness}}\n[[Category:Brand management]]\n[[Category:Intellectual property law]]\n[[Category:Product management]]\n[[Category:Trademark law|Distinctiveness]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}\n{{Globalize|date=November 2011}}\n}}\n  \n'''Trademark distinctiveness''' is an important concept in the law governing [[trademark]]s and [[service mark]]s.

For example, \"[[Kodak]]\" had no meaning before it was adopted and used as a trademark in relation to goods, whether photographic goods or otherwise. Invented marks are [[neologism]]s which will not previously have been found in any [[dictionary]].\n\n===Arbitrary marks===\nAn '''arbitrary''' trademark is usually a common word which is used in a meaningless context (e.g. \"[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]\" for computers). Such marks consist of words or images which have some dictionary meaning before being adopted as trademarks, but which are used in connection with products or services unrelated to that dictionary meaning. Arbitrary marks are also immediately eligible for registration. ''Salty'' would be an arbitrary mark if it used in connection with e.g. telephones such as in ''Salty Telephones'', as the term \"[[salt]]\" has no particular connection with such products.\n\n===Suggestive marks===\nA '''suggestive''' mark tends to indicate the nature, quality, or a characteristic of the products or services in relation to which it is used, but does not describe this characteristic, and requires imagination on the part of the consumer to identify the characteristic. Suggestive marks invoke the consumer\u2019s perceptive imagination. An example of a suggestive mark is [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], a new technology of high-capacity data storage that utilizes a \"blue\" (actually [[Violet (color)|violet]]) [[laser]].\n\n===Descriptive marks===\nA '''descriptive''' mark is a term with a dictionary meaning which is used in connection with products or services directly related to that meaning. An example might be ''Salty'' used in connection with saltine crackers or anchovies. Such terms are not registrable unless it can be shown that distinctive character has been established in the term through extensive use in the [[marketplace]] (see further below). [[Lektronic]] was famously refused protection by the USPTO on the grounds of being descriptive for electronic goods.\n\n===Generic terms===\n{{Redirect|Generic term|other possible uses and contexts|Generic (disambiguation){{!}}Generic}}\nA '''generic term''' is the common name for the products or services in connection with which it is used, such as \"salt\" when used in connection with sodium chloride. A generic term is not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing the products or services of a business from the products or services of other businesses, and therefore cannot be afforded any legal protection. This is because there has to be some term which may generally be used by anyone\u2014including other manufacturers\u2014to refer to a product without using some organization's proprietary trademark. Marks which become generic after losing distinctive character are known as [[genericized trademark]]s. Marks which are a misspelling of a generic term (e.g., the elimination of a space) do not change the generic significance of the term.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/other/2005/76219917.pdf|title= In re NetEnterprise, Inc., Serial No. 76219917|work=USPTO|language=en|date=2005-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thettablog.blogspot.com/2005/05/netenterprise-generic-for-internet.html|title='NETENTERPRISE' Generic For An Internet Business, Says TTAB|work=TTABlog|language=en|date=2005-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessing distinctiveness==\nIn trademark litigation, courts are most frequently asked to distinguish between ''suggestive'' and ''descriptive'' marks on the one hand, and between ''descriptive'' and ''generic'' marks on the other. This is because suggestive marks, like fanciful and arbitrary marks, are presumed to be entitled to trademark protection, while descriptive marks are entitled to protection if they have become known as representing the producer of the goods, and generic marks can never receive protection. It can be seen from the examples above that the distinctive character of a term is closely related to the products or services in relation to which the term is used.\n\nA general method for assessing the distinctive character of a mark is to consider a consumer's reaction to a mark. The mark may only be inherently registrable if the consumer has never encountered the mark before. On the other hand, the mark is unlikely to be inherently registrable if it informs him about any characteristic of the relevant products or services (e.g. whether they are delicious, large, spicy, black, or sweet, in the case of fruit). In any other case the mark may not be registrable.\n\nAnother example of a descriptive mark would be a geographical word or phrase that merely indicates the origin of the product or service. For example, [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] based [[ice cream]] might find that the name \"Houston ice cream\" is denied trademark protection on the grounds that the word Houston is merely descriptive. However, they might have better luck with the name \"North Pole ice cream\". In the latter case, although North Pole is a geographical location, the ice cream is not actually made at the [[North Pole]], and no reasonable person would assume that the phrase North Pole is literally descriptive.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.findlaw.com/12international/countries/nz/articles/482.html| publisher= Findlaw|title=Trading on a good name| first=Baldwin Shelston| last= Waters|author2=Angela Sutton |date=July 2001}}</ref>\n\nTherefore marks that identify or describe a product or service, or that are in common use, or that are used as [[geographical indication]]s, generally cannot be registered as trademarks, and remain in the [[public domain]] for use by anyone. For example, a generic term such as \"apple\", or descriptive terms such as \"red\" or \"juicy\" could not be registered in relation to apples.\n\nPrimary consideration in the selection and use of trademarks should be given to marks which are inherently distinctive, as they possess the strongest distinctive character and do not require evidence of use to establish acquired distinctiveness. A fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive term can be inherently distinctive and registrable without proof of acquired distinctiveness.\nAlthough these categories are most easily applied in relation to trademarks comprising words, the same general principles are applied in relation to all kinds of trademarks. For example, a pine tree shape is descriptive when used on pine-scented products.\n\n===Acquired distinctiveness===\nA trademark with no distinctive character (i.e. a mark which is not inherently distinctive) is [[prima facie]] unregistrable. However, most jurisdictions may still allow such marks to be registered if the trademark owner can demonstrate, typically by reference to '''evidence of use''', that consumers in the marketplace exclusively associate the mark, as used on the identified goods or in connection with the identified services, with a particular commercial origin or source (i.e. the trademark owner). \"Use\" may include authorized use by a licensee or other party. If the trade mark office is satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that a mark has \"acquired\" distinctive character ''as a [[de facto|matter of fact]]'', then the mark may be accepted for registration on the basis of '''acquired distinctiveness'''.\n\nThe nature and extent of acceptable evidence of use varies between jurisdictions, although the most useful evidence usually includes sales figures, details of advertising and promotional expenditure, and examples of promotional material. Consumer surveys may also help establish that consumers chiefly associate an otherwise non-distinctive mark with the trademark owner and its products or services. Generally, evidence of use may only be acceptable or relevant if it covers a certain period of time (e.g. three years prior to the filing date of the trademark application) and originates from within the jurisdiction where registration is sought.\n\nThe terminology of acquired distinctiveness is accepted in the [[European Union]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions such as [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and the common law jurisdiction of the [[United States]] (which also uses the term '''secondary meaning'''). In the U.S., if a trademark has been used for a continuous period of at least five years after the date of registration, the right to use the mark and the registration may become \"incontestable\" (e.g. invulnerable to cancellation for non-use, but not for becoming [[Genericized trademark|generic]]). In such cases the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] checks and confirms whether the request for incontestability meets formality requirements, but whether a registration is incontestable at law can only be determined during legal proceedings involving the registration.\n\nThe essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services, such that a trademark, properly called, indicates source or serves as a badge of origin. The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use. Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark, which can be enforced by way of an action for trademark infringement, while unregistered trademark rights may be enforced pursuant to the common law tort of [[passing off]].\n\nTrademark rights generally arise out of the use and/or registration (see below) of a mark in connection only with a specific type or range of products or services. Although it may sometimes be possible to take legal action to prevent the use of a mark in relation to products or services outside this range (e.g. for passing off), this does not mean that trademark law prevents the use of that mark by the general public. A common word, phrase, or other sign can only be removed from the public domain to the extent that a trademark owner is able to maintain exclusive rights over that sign in relation to certain products or services, assuming there are no other trademark objections. For a case study in both concepts, see ''[[Apple Corps v Apple Computer]].''\n\n===Maintaining distinctiveness===\nIf a court rules that a trademark has become \"[[genericized trademark|generic]]\" through common use (such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it), the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid.\n\nFor example, the [[Bayer]] company's trademark \"[[Aspirin]]\" has been ruled generic in the United States, so other companies may use that name for [[acetylsalicylic acid]] as well (although it is still a trademark in [[Canada]]). [[Xerox]] for photocopiers and [[Band-Aid]] for adhesive bandages are both trademarks which are at risk of succumbing to death by becoming declared generic in certain countries, something that the respective trademark owners actively seek to prevent. In order to prevent marks becoming generic, trademark owners often contact those who appear to be using the trademark incorrectly, from web page authors to dictionary editors, and request that they cease the improper usage.\n\nThe proper use of a trademark means using the mark as an [[adjective]], not as a [[noun]] or a [[verb]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.inta.org/index.php?option=com_simplefaq&task=display&Itemid=60&catid=284&page=1&getcontent=1#FAQ75| publisher=[[International Trademark Association]]| title= How Do I Use a Trademark Properly?| work=Information and Publishing FAQ| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.3com.com/corpinfo/en_US/legal/trademark/prop_usage_tmb.html#1| title=Always Use a Trademark as an Adjective, Followed by the Appropriate Noun Descriptor(s)| publisher=3Com Legal| work=Trademarks and Brands| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html| title=Permissions and trademark guidelines| publisher=Adobe| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000943.html | title=A Guide to Proper Trademark Use | author=Pullum, Geoffrey K.  | accessdate=2006-12-05 | work= }}</ref> though for certain trademarks, use as nouns and, less commonly, verbs is common. For example, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] sent e-mails to many web authors using the term \"[[photoshopped]]\" telling them that they should only use the term \"modified by Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae software.\"  Xerox has also purchased print advertisements declaring that \"you cannot 'xerox' a document, but you can copy it on a Xerox Brand copying on machine.\" Another popular example is the use of the word \"[[frappuccino]]\" by [[Starbucks]] customers to mean any blended coffee beverage, though employees are instructed to only say \"frappuccino blended coffee\" or \"frappuccino blended cream\" when referring to such drinks. This rule is not hard-and-fast, however; for example, Lexis-Nexis has a U.S. trademark registration for \"Shepardize,\" [http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=74120780 Reg. No. 1743711], and defines \"Shepardizing on a web page as \"the process of looking up citations\" in \"a series of books called Shepard's Citations.\"<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-09-12|title=Farewell to Zimmerman\u2019s Research Guide|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/infopro/keeping-current/b/weblog/archive/2015/12/10/farewell-to-zimmerman-s-research-guide.aspx|website=www.lexisnexis.com}}</ref> Such efforts may or may not be successful in preventing genericism in the long run, which depends less on the mark owner's efforts and more on how the public actually perceives and uses the mark. In fact, legally it is more important that the trademark holder visibly and actively seems to attempt to prevent its trademark from becoming generic, regardless of real success.{{cn|date=January 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ghost mark]]s\n* [[:wikt:Transwiki:Glossary of legal terms in technology|Glossary of legal terms in technology]]\n* [[International Trademark Association]]\n* [[Madrid system]]\n* [[Proper adjective]]\n* [[Service mark]]s\n* [[Trade dress]]\n* [[Trademark attorney]]\n* [[Trademark dilution]]\n* [[Unregistered trademark]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|trademark}}\n{{Wikibooks|US Trademark Law}}\n* Canadian Trademark Law [https://web.archive.org/web/20080918044116/http://www.crollco.com/FAQs.php FAQ]\n\n{{Trademark law}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trademark Distinctiveness}}\n[[Category:Brand management]]\n[[Category:Intellectual property law]]\n[[Category:Product management]]\n[[Category:Trademark law|Distinctiveness]]\n", "name_user": "Msel20", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add citations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_distinctiveness"}

Wee-Bey was also responsible for more mundane activities including driving and picking up money. He and [[Barksdale Organization#De'Londa Brice|De'Londa]]<ref>[http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/characters/delonda_brice.shtml HBO]</ref> have a son, [[Namond Brice|Namond]].

When Avon is cleaning up any possible trail of evidence leading back to him, Wee-Bey kills a witness who had previously been bought off. Wee-Bey gets involved in two different gun fights with legendary stick-up man [[Omar Little]], after torturing and killing Omar's partner, accomplice and lover [[Omar Little and Associates#Brandon Wright|Brandon]]. Their first encounter ends with Wee-Bey being shot in the leg, but he later defends Avon against Omar, shooting him in the shoulder and forcing him to retreat. Wee-Bey has the distinction of being the only character in the Wire to get the better of Omar in a one-to-one gunfight.\n\nWee-Bey was also linked to the body of a dancer from Orlando's strip club, a Barksdale [[Front organization|front company]]. Although not responsible for her death, he slept with her the evening before and showed little concern after she died from a drug overdose. Disgusted with his callous disposal of her body, [[Barksdale Organization#Shardene Innes|Shardene]] gives information to [[Lester Freamon]].\n\nHis downfall comes when he and [[Barksdale Organization#Little Man|Little Man]] kill [[Barksdale Organization#Wendell \"Orlando\" Blocker|Orlando]], who was working as a police informant. During the killing, Little Man shoots and critically wounds the undercover [[Kima Greggs]], in the car with Orlando. Wee-Bey is stunned to learn that the second shooting victim was an undercover cop. Stringer orders Wee-Bey to kill Little Man, stating that he is unreliable as a soldier, and flee town; [[D'Angelo Barksdale]] is responsible for driving Wee-Bey to [[Philadelphia]] (and taking care of his fish). When D'Angelo is arrested soon after, he gives the police information concerning Wee-Bey's whereabouts and his murder of Deirdre Kresson, a former girlfriend of Avon's.  Later, through a combination of the active wiretap and phone records, the police are able to determine Wee-Bey's exact location. To apprehend Wee-Bey unarmed, they lure him out of the house by having [[Ellis Carver|Carver]] break the windows on his car.  Once in custody, and guaranteed a life sentence for his involvement in Kima's shooting, Wee-Bey confesses to other murders, including several he did not commit, to protect those in the [[Barksdale Organization]].\n\n===Season two===\nWee-Bey is imprisoned with Avon, serving life without parole. He keeps artificial fish in his cell and enjoys a relatively easy life under Barksdale's protection.

He was a member of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] until its dissolution in 1994, then a member of the [[United Christian Democrats]] and finally of the [[Rebirth of Christian Democracy]].\n\n==Biography==\nPiccoli was born in [[Austria]], where his family had been deported during [[World War I]]. Son of Bennone, archivist in the Austrian administration, and Teresa Rigo, he was the last of four brothers (preceded by Ada, Nilo and Adone).\n\nReturning to Trentino after the conflict, he studied in the schools of Trento. Subsequently, he enrolled at the Ca 'Foscari University of Venice where he graduated in Foreign Languages and Literatures, presenting a thesis on Baudelaire's poetics. In these years he took part in the Catholic movement of Trentino, animated by the archbishop Celestino Endrici.\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], he was sent to the front as captain of the [[Alpini]]. He was engaged in [[France]], [[Albania]], [[Montenegro]], the [[Dauphin\u00e9]]; after 8 September 1943 he was taken prisoner and managed to escape from the German convoy which was to lead him to a concentration camp in [[Poland]].\n\nActively participate in the Resistance and the Liberation War, representing the Christian Democracy. On 7 May 1945, he was in charge of relations with the press. In August 1945 he founded the local newspaper \"Il Popolo Trentino\", which in 1951 took the name of [[l'Adige (newspaper)|L'Adige]], and was its editor in chief until 1977. Also during 1945 he married Maria Cescatti. After a long experience in journalism, he became general secretary of the International Federation of Catholic Journalists and for many years President of the Union of the Italian Catholic Press.  He became president of the diocesan junta of the Trentino [[Azione Cattolica|Catholic Action]], called in 1952 by Archbishop Carlo De Ferrari. During this mandate Piccoli, together with Monsignor Alfonso Cesconi, claims the need for distinction between the religious and spiritual formation tasks of Catholic associations and the political and autonomous role of the party. This position also cost him an intervention by [[L'Osservatore Romano]] and his removal from the diocesan presidency of the Trentino Catholic association. \n\nIn 1957 he became provincial secretary of the Trentino Christian Democracy. In the 1958 elections he was elected for the first time to the Chamber of Deputies. He was continuously elected as deputy until 1992, when he was elected senator in the constituency of [[Castellammare di Stabia]] (NA).\n\nWithin the part he participated in the current of Democratic Initiative, which marked the transition from the degasperian generation to the so-called \"second generation\" and, subsequently, in the early 1960s, participated in the foundation of the \"Dorotean faction\". On 19 January 1969, Piccoli was elected national secretary of the party, a position he voluntarily left in the autumn of the same year following the division of the Dorotean faction into the factions \"Popular Initiative\" (the majority area that referred to Piccoli, Rumor and Bisaglia) and \"Democratic Commitment\" (which instead brought together the exponents who recognize themselves in Emilio Colombo and Giulio Andreotti). Arnaldo Forlani succeeded him in as secretary.\n\nHe served as Minister of State Holdings from 1970 to 1972, he was elected President of the Christian Democratic Parliamentary Group of the Chamber in the VI Legislature (25 May 1972 to 4 July 1976); subsequently it was the group leader of DC also in the VII Legislature (from 15 July 1976 to 2 October 1978).  In 1978, after [[Aldo Moro]]'s death, he replaced him as president of the national party council.\n\nOn 5 March 5 1980 he was re-elected national political secretary, a position he held until 1982, initiating a process of opening up Christian Democracy to the Catholic world leading to the National Assembly of \"outsiders\" and the direct involvement in politics of many intellectuals from the Catholic area. After the 1982 Congress in Rome, which elected [[Ciriaco De Mita]] as political secretary, he was again called to the presidency of the National Council, a position held until May 1986.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1989 he held the position of President of the [[Christian Democratic International]], and was elected President of the Foreign Commission of the Chamber.

He was a member of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] until its dissolution in 1994, then a member of the [[United Christian Democrats]] and finally of the [[Rebirth of Christian Democracy]].\n\n==Biography==\nPiccoli was born in [[Austria]], where his family had been deported during [[World War I]]. Son of Bennone, archivist in the Austrian administration, and Teresa Rigo, he was the last of four brothers (preceded by Ada, Nilo and Adone).\n\nReturning to Trentino after the conflict, he studied in the schools of Trento. Subsequently he enrolled at the Ca 'Foscari University of Venice where he graduated in Foreign Languages and Literatures, presenting a thesis on Baudelaire's poetics. In these years he took part in the Catholic movement of Trentino, animated by the archbishop Celestino Endrici.\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], he was sent to the front as captain of the [[Alpini]]. He was engaged in [[France]], [[Albania]], [[Montenegro]], the [[Dauphin\u00e9]]; after 8 September 1943 he was taken prisoner and managed to escape from the German convoy which was to lead him to a concentration camp in [[Poland]].\n\nActively participate in the Resistance and the Liberation War, representing the Christian Democracy. On 7 May 1945, he was in charge of relations with the press. In August 1945 he founded the local newspaper \"Il Popolo Trentino\", which in 1951 took the name of [[l'Adige (newspaper)|L'Adige]], and was its editor in chief until 1977. Also during 1945 he married Maria Cescatti. After a long experience in journalism, he became general secretary of the International Federation of Catholic Journalists and for many years President of the Union of the Italian Catholic Press.  He became president of the diocesan junta of the Trentino [[Azione Cattolica|Catholic Action]], called in 1952 by Archbishop Carlo De Ferrari. During this mandate Piccoli, together with Monsignor Alfonso Cesconi, claims the need for distinction between the religious and spiritual formation tasks of Catholic associations and the political and autonomous role of the party. This position also cost him an intervention by [[L'Osservatore Romano]] and his removal from the diocesan presidency of the Trentino Catholic association. \n\nIn 1957 he became provincial secretary of the Trentino Christian Democracy. In the 1958 elections he was elected for the first time to the Chamber of Deputies. He he was continuously elected as deputy until 1992, when he was elected senator in the constituency of [[Castellammare di Stabia]] (NA).\n\nWithin the part he participated in the current of Democratic Initiative, which marked the transition from the degasperian generation to the so-called \"second generation\" and, subsequently, in the early 1960s, participated in the foundation of the \"Dorotean faction\". On 19 January 1969, Piccoli was elected national secretary of the party, a position he voluntarily left in the autumn of the same year following the division of the Dorotean faction into the factions \"Popular Initiative\" (the majority area that referred to Piccoli, Rumor and Bisaglia) and \"Democratic Commitment\" (which instead brought together the exponents who recognize themselves in Emilio Colombo and Giulio Andreotti). Arnaldo Forlani succeeded him in as secretary.\n\nHe served as Minister of State Holdings from 1970 to 1972, he was elected President of the Christian Democratic Parliamentary Group of the Chamber in the VI Legislature (25 May 1972 to 4 July 1976); subsequently it was the group leader of DC also in the VII Legislature (from 15 July 1976 to 2 October 1978).  In 1978, after [[Aldo Moro]]'s death, he replaced him as president of the national party council.\n\nOn 5 March 5 1980 he was re-elected national political secretary, a position he held until 1982, initiating a process of opening up Christian Democracy to the Catholic world leading to the National Assembly of \"outsiders\" and the direct involvement in politics of many intellectuals from the Catholic area. After the 1982 Congress in Rome, which elected [[Ciriaco De Mita]] as political secretary, he was again called to the presidency of the National Council, a position held until May 1986.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1989 he held the position of President of the [[Christian Democratic International]], and was elected President of the Foreign Commission of the Chamber. As president of the Foreign Commission, in April 1988 he made a trip to the [[Soviet Union]], during which he pronounced some phrases related to the Italian expedition to Russia in the Second World War that aroused controversial reactions (especially by MP [[Mirko Tremaglia]] of the [[Italian Social Movement]], also a member of the commission) and a debate in the Chamber.

and churches in the north and south used to colonize and convert the inhabitants during the [[Dutch Taiwan|Dutch]] and [[Spanish Taiwan|Spanish]] period; the [[Kingdom of Tungning|Tungning]] period when Taiwan was a base of [[anti-Qing sentiment]] and Minnan-style architecture was introduced; in [[Qing dynasty]] period, a mix of Chinese and Western architecture appeared and [[artillery battery]] flourished during Qing's [[Self-Strengthening Movement]]; During the [[Japanese rule of Taiwan]], the Minnan, [[Japanese culture|Japanese]] and [[Western culture|Western]] culture were main influencers in architectural designs and saw the introduction and use of [[reinforced concrete]]. Due to excessive Westernization as a colony, after the [[Retrocession Day|retrocession of Taiwan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] in 1945 from Japan at the end of World War II, Chinese classical style became popular and entered into international mainstream as a postmodern design style.

In more recent times, Taiwanese aborigines make use of them for holding church meetings, as places to cool down and to hold ancestral activities.

The Dutch used red bricks in construction while the Spanish used stone. Both sides made use of ports and constructed fortresses to consolidate their power on the island.
