However a vigil Mass may be held on the evening before a Holy Day; thus it has become customary to celebrate Mass on the evening of New Year's Eve. (New Year's Eve is a [[Silvester|feast day]] honoring [[Pope Sylvester I]] in the Roman Catholic calendar, but it is not widely recognized in the United States.){{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMany Christian congregations have New Year's Eve [[watchnight service]]s. Some, especially [[Lutheran]]s and [[Methodist]]s and those in the [[Black church|African American community]], have a tradition known as \"Watch Night\", in which the faithful congregate in services continuing past midnight, giving thanks for the blessings of the outgoing year and praying for divine favor during the upcoming year.

In [[Caracas]], the bells of the Cathedral of Caracas ring twelve times.<ref name=\":0\" /> During these special programs, is a tradition to broadcast songs about the end of the year. It is a non-working holiday. Popular songs include \"Viejo a\u00f1o\" (\"Old year\"), by [[Gaita Zuliana|Gaita]] group [[Maracaibo 15]], and \"Cinco pa' las 12\" (\"Five minutes before twelve\"), which was versioned by several popular singers including Nestor Zavarce, Nancy Ramos and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez El Puma]]. The unofficial hymn for the first minutes of the New Year is \"A\u00f1o Nuevo, Vida Nueva\" (\"New Year, New Life\"), by the band Billo's Caracas Boys. Many people play the national anthem in their houses.\n\nTraditions include wearing yellow underwear, eating [[Pan de jam\u00f3n]], and 12 grapes with sparkling wine.\n\nSpecial holiday programs are broadcast on Venezuelan television stations including [[Venevision]].\n\n==Asia==\n===Bangladesh===\nThe New Year celebrations take place in all around the country mostly in [[Dhaka]], [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Khulna]], [[Barishal]], [[Cox's Bazar]] etc. The celebrations mostly take place at night. On this day, people go to the parties at club or hotels, beaches, at the crowdy roadsides and bridges where firecrackers are blast out in the sky at night. The roadsides and bridges are also lighted up by colourful lights at night. People do a get-together as well as enjoy with their families.

The [[Christians]] go to the churches for a watch night service till midnight, praying for blessing in the coming new year as it is also part of the [[Christmastide]] season observances.\n\n===China===\nIn [[China]], although the celebrations of the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]] are not until a few weeks after the Gregorian New Year, celebrations of the Gregorian New Year are held in some areas, particularly in major cities. For example, celebrations with fireworks and rock concerts have taken place in [[Beijing]]'s Solana Blue Harbor Shopping Park, while cultural shows and other events are held at the city's Millennium Monument, [[Temple of Heaven]], [[Great Wall of China]], [[Olympic Green]], and the [[Summer Palace]]. Since 2011, a light and sound show has been held at [[The Bund (Shanghai)|The Bund]] in [[Shanghai]], a few minutes before midnight.\n\n====Hong Kong====\n[[File:HK NYE.jpg|thumb|Fireworks display in [[Hong Kong]].]]\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], many gather in shopping districts like [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Causeway Bay]] and [[Tsim Sha Tsui]]. Beginning in 2008, a 60-second numerical countdown to New Year's, consisting of [[LED]] lights and pyrotechnic display effects, on the facade of [[Two International Finance Centre]] was launched, followed by a fireworks display, alongside an exhibition of the [[A Symphony of Lights|Symphony of Lights]]. For the arrival of 2013, the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]] initiated the countdown, while the fireworks display and A Symphony of Lights show were extended to eight minutes.\n\nShopping malls are often major celebration venues. The [[Times Square (Hong Kong)|Times Square]] shopping mall, for instance, holds their own celebration of the ball drop held at [[Times Square]], [[New York City]]. There are also various district-wide celebrations.\n\n===Central Asia===\nIn [[Central Asia]], New Year's Eve celebrations were inherited from Soviet traditions; thus they are similar to those of Russia. An example of such traditions would be the playing of the national anthem at midnight and the presidential address before it.\n\n===India===\nIn India as a land of diverse cultures and practices, apart from the Gregorian new year, there is Parsi New Year, Hindu New Year(which might differ from region to region), Muslim New Year, etc. Celebration for culture-specific new years is different from the celebrations of the Gregorian new year. Gregorian new year celebration is mostly by way of parties late night and a working holiday followed by it. Most celebrations for December 31 take place in the major metropolitan cities like [[Kochi]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]], [[Pune]], [[Ahmedabad]]. New Year is also celebrated in other cities and towns around the country like [[Agra]], [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Cuttack]], [[Vadodara]], etc., There are lots of shows, events, awards and parties organized all over India. Big and small celebrities and personalities perform as well as enjoy in these parties. Many Discos and Pubs organize big singers, DJs or local talent to liven up the night with their music and songs.

More often people like to celebrate New Year Eve with their family. Hotels and resorts are also decked up in anticipation of tourist arrival and intense competition makes them entice the tourists with exciting New Year offers. Many people across the country also follow old traditions. The[[Christians|Christian]] community often go to church for a watch night service till midnight praying for blessing in the coming new year.\n\n===Indonesia===\nNew Year's Eve celebrations in [[Medan]] ([[Capital city|capital]] of [[North Sumatra]]), included the [[:id:Dunia Terbalik|Dunia Terbalik New Year Countdown Celebrations fireworks]] which was part of the event called \"[[Pelita Harapan University|Medan Pelita Harapan University]] Down Eve Countdown.\" The event, which celebrated the arrival of 2018, attracted 400,000 spectators along both sides of the [[CIMB Niaga]]. The [[countdown]] was televised live in [[Indonesia]] via [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] [[high-definition television|high-definition]] on [[satellite television|satellite transmission]], and aired on [[RCTI|RCTI HD]]'s [[:id:Dunia Terbalik|Dunia Terbalik]] and was sponsored by [[Charoen Pokphand Foods|Fiesta Black Tea]]. It included various national performances such as the \"Dunia Terbalik All Star\" performance, which reached more than 1.9 million viewers. Over 200 local and overseas media organizations covered the spectacular that generated a publicity value of more than [[Indonesian rupiah|RP]]1000 million.\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|\u014cmisoka}}\n[[File:Tokyo Tower in New Year's Eve 2012.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Tokyo Tower on New Year's Eve, 2012]]\nIn [[Japan]], New Year's Eve is used to prepare for and welcome ''Toshigami'' (\u5e74\u795e), the New Year's god. People clean their home and prepare [[Kadomatsu]] or [[Shimenawa]] to welcome the god before New Year's Eve. Buddhist temples ring their bells 108 times<ref name=telegraph/> at midnight in the traditional ''Joya no Kane'' (\u9664\u591c\u306e\u9418). The rings represent the 108 elements of ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|bon\u014d]]'' (\u7169\u60a9), mental states that lead people to take unwholesome actions.\n\nIn most cities and urban areas across Japan, New Year's Eve celebrations are usually accompanied by concerts, countdowns, fireworks and other events. In [[Tokyo]], the two most crowded celebrations are held at the Shibuya crossing in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] and the [[Z\u014dj\u014d-ji|Zojoji Temple]] in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]. People gather around the Zojoji Temple to release helium balloons with New Year's wishes up in the sky and watch the lighting of [[Tokyo Tower]] and [[Tokyo Skytree]] with a year number displayed on the observatory at the stroke of midnight.\n\nThree notable music-oriented television specials air near New Year's Eve. Since 1951, [[NHK]] has traditionally broadcast ''[[K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]]'' (''Red and White Song Battle'') on New Year's Eve, a music competition where two teams of popular musicians (the red and white teams, which predominantly contain female and male performers respectively) perform songs, with the winning team determined by a panel of judges and televotes. The special is traditionally one of the most-watched television programs of the year in Japan. Although it did air on 31 December from 1959 to 2006, the [[Japan Record Award]]s ceremony, recognizing outstanding achievements in the [[Music of Japan|Japanese music industry]], is held annually on 30 December since 2007 and is broadcast by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]. Since 1996, [[Fuji Television]] has broadcast ''Johnny's Countdown''\u2014a live concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]] organized by the talent agency [[Johnny & Associates]].\n\n===Korea===\nThere are two New Years celebrated in both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], which are Lunar New Year and Solar New Year. The Solar New Year are always celebrated on the first day of January while Lunar New Year varies. Sometimes there are some traits that both North and South Korea celebrate, while some traits are celebrated differently or only on one side.\n\nIn both Koreas, they call New Year's Day \uc124\ub0a0 (Seoll-Nal). They eat a special soup called \ub5a1\uad6d (Tteok-Guk) which is a hot soup with thin, flat rice cakes and most of the times, eggs are inserted. The Koreans believe that one would get to earn one age if the soup is eaten New Year's Day. They say if one dares to not eat the soup on New Year's Day, then he or she will lose luck.\n\nMost cities and urban areas in both Koreas host New Year's Eve gatherings. In South Korea, two of the biggest celebrations take place in [[Seoul]]: the ringing of [[Bosingak]] bell 33 times at midnight and fireworks display at [[Myeong-dong]], and an LED laser light show and fireworks display at the [[Lotte World Tower]] in [[Songpa District|Songpa-gu]]. In [[Pyongyang]], North Korea, the chimes of the clock at the Grand People's Study House and the national fireworks display along [[Kim Il-sung Square]], [[Juche Tower]] and the surrounding areas signal the start of the New Year. The celebration in Pyongyang, however, also marks the beginning of the [[North Korean calendar]] or the Juche Year, which is based on 15 April 1912, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s date of birth, the celebrations are more recent in origin with the fireworks displays dating from 2013.\n\nFor 2018-2019, Kim Il-sung Square held its first large-scale public celebration, which featured a concert performance by the state [[Moranbong Band]], midnight fireworks, and a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] light show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/12/north-korea-rings-in-new-year-with-midnight-concert-drone-show/|title=North Korea rings in new year with midnight concert, drone show|date=1 January 2019|website=NK News|language=en-US|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\n[[File:2018 New Year Fireworks in George Town, Penang.jpg|left|thumb|Fireworks in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]] on 1 January 2018]]\n[[File:MALAM TAHUN BARU (5309956791).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fireworks in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia]]\n''Ambang Tahun Baru'', a celebration sponsored by the government was held at [[Dataran Merdeka|Merdeka Square]], the field opposite the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]] in the [[Malaysia]]n capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the early days.

As a modern tradition, New Year's Eve as well as New Year's Day are public holidays, and are two of the biggest holidays of the year. They celebrate New Year's Eve with their family. It is common, just like in the former Soviet Union, that the [[National Anthem of Mongolia]] is to be played at the midnight hour on television.\n\n===Pakistan===\nNew Year's Eve is usually celebrated with fireworks in big cities (e.g. [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]]). Musical nights and concerts are also held.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMany Pakistani youngsters enjoy the type of celebrations held the world over. The elite and educated classes participate in night-long activities in urban and cosmopolitan cities like Karachi, Lahore, and the capital of Islamabad.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Philippines===\nIn the [[Philippines]], New Year's Eve (''Bisperas ng Bagong Taon'') is a special non-working holiday. [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] usually celebrate New Year's Eve in the company of family or close friends. Traditionally, most households would visit the churches and attend year-end service and afterwards, would host or attend a midnight feast called the ''Media Noche''. Typical dishes included holiday fare, ''[[pancit]]'' (for long life) and ''[[Jam\u00f3n|Ham\u00f3n]]''. ''[[Lechon]]'' (roasted pig), is usually prepared, as is barbecued food. Some refrain from serving chicken, as their scratching and pecking for food is unlucky, being an idiom for a hand-to-mouth existence.\n\nMany opt to wear new, bright, or colourful clothes with circular patterns, such as [[polka dot]]s, or display sweets and twelve round fruits as the centrepiece, in the belief that circles attract money and fortune and that candies represent a sweeter year ahead. Several customs must only be done at midnight: some throw about coins to increase wealth in the coming year, or jump to increase their height, while some follow the [[Spanish influence on Filipino culture|Spanish custom]] of eating twelve grapes, one for each month of the year. People also make loud noises by blowing on cardboard or plastic horns, called ''torotot'', banging on pots and pans, playing loud music, blowing car horns, or by igniting firecrackers, in the belief that the din scares away bad luck and evil spirits. [[Bamboo cannon]]s are also fired on the night in some places.\n\nUrban areas usually host many New Year's Eve parties and countdown celebrations hosted by the private sector with the help of the local government. These parties, which include balls hosted by hotels, usually display their own fireworks and are often very well-attended. Within Metro Manila, popular locations for celebrations include the area along [[Manila Bay]] at [[Roxas Boulevard]] or [[Luneta Park]] in [[Manila]], the intersection of Ayala and Makati Avenues in [[Makati City]], [[Resorts World Manila]] and [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay City]], [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] in Diliman and [[Eastwood City]] in Libis, [[Quezon City]], [[Bonifacio Global City]] in [[Taguig City]], [[Entertainment City]] in [[Para\u00f1aque|Para\u00f1aque City]], and the [[Philippine Arena]] at [[Ciudad de Victoria]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]] and [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]], [[Bulacan]].

It is a public holiday. In most cities and urban areas across [[Thailand]], New Year's Eve celebrations are accompanied by countdowns, fireworks, concerts and other major events, notably, the CentralWorld Square at [[CentralWorld]] and the area along [[Chao Phraya River]] at [[ICONSIAM]] and [[Asiatique]] in [[Bangkok]], and the Pattaya Beach in [[Pattaya]], while public places such as hotels, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, also host New Year's Eve parties by offering food, entertainment and music to the guests, and they usually stay open until the next morning.\n{{-}}\n\n==Europe==\n===Albania===\nPreparations for New Year's Eve in [[Albania]] start with the Christmas tree, which in Albania is known as \"New Year's Tree\" or \"New Year's Pine\".

Many people dance to this at parties or in the street. Large crowds gather in the streets of Vienna, where the municipal government organises a series of stages where bands and orchestras play. Fireworks are set off by both municipal governments and individuals.\n\n===Belgium===\nIn [[Belgium]], New Year's Eve (''Sint Sylvester Vooravond'' (\"Saint Sylvester's Eve\") or ''Oudjaar'' (\"old year\")) is celebrated with family parties, called ''r\u00e9veillons'' in the [[Wallonia|French speaking areas]]. On television, a stand-up comedian reviews the past year after which a musical or variety show signals midnight, when everyone kisses, exchanges good luck greetings, and toasts the New Year and absent relatives and friends with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. Many people light fireworks or go into the street to watch them. Most cities have their own fireworks display: the most famous is at [[Mont des Arts]] in Brussels. Cities, caf\u00e9s and restaurants are crowded. Free bus services and special New Year's Eve taxis (the ''Responsible Young Drivers'') bring everyone home afterwards.\n\nOn 1 January (''Nieuwjaarsdag'' in Dutch) children read their \"New Year's letter\" and give holiday greeting cards of decorated paper featuring golden cherubs and angels, colored roses and ribbon-tied garlands to parents and godparents, on decorated paper.\n\nBelgian farmers also wish their animals a happy New Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanplace.com/newyear/newyrcustom/belgium.html|title=Belgian New Year: Sint Sylvester Vooranvond|author= Christine OKeeffe|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Bosnia and Herzegovina===\nNew Year is widely celebrated in [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]].

New Year's Eve is the noisiest day of the year. People generally gather with friends at parties, in pubs, clubs, in the streets, or city squares to eat, drink, and celebrate the new year. Fireworks are a popular tradition; in large cities such as [[Bratislava]], or [[Prague]], the fireworks start before noon and steadily increase until midnight. In the first minutes after midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health, and go outside for the fireworks.\n\nIn both countries all major TV stations air entertainment shows before and after the midnight countdown, which is followed by the National anthem of each country. The Presidents of the republics gave their [[New Year speech]] in the morning \u2013 the new Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman renewed the tradition of Christmas speeches. In recent years however the Czechoslovak national anthem is played at midnight, in honor of the shared history of both nations.\n\n===Denmark===\n[[File:CopenhagenNYE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|New Year fireworks over [[Copenhagen]]]]\nPeople in [[Denmark]] may go to parties or entertain guests at home.

Meals should not be completely finished\u2014some food should be left for ancestors and spirits who visit the house on New Year's Eve.\n\nTraditional New Year food includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes and swedes with hog's head, and white and blood sausage. Vegetarians can eat potato salad with navy beet{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and p\u00e2t\u00e9. Gingerbread and marzipan are very popular for dessert. Traditional New Year drinks include beer and mead, but mulled wine and champagne have become modern favourites.\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with family or friends. Late supper is served, often featuring wieners, [[Janssons frestelse]], and potato salad. Some municipalities organize fireworks at midnight. Consumer fireworks are also very popular. A Finnish tradition is [[molybdomancy]] \u2013 to tell the fortunes of the New Year by melting \"tin\" (actually lead) in a tiny pan on the stove and throwing it quickly in a bucket of cold water. The resulting blob of metal is analyzed, for example by interpreting shadows it casts by candlelight. These predictions are however never taken seriously.\n\nThe Finnish Broadcasting Company broadcasts the reception of the New Year at [[Helsinki Senate Square]]. Countdown to New Year is with the [[Helsinki Cathedral]] clock. In the afternoon programme, the German comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]'' is shown every year. On the radio, just before midnight, the poem ''Hymyilev\u00e4 Apollo'' (Smiling Apollo) by [[Eino Leino]] is read.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |title=Eino Leino |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170013/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |archivedate=5 March 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Eiffel Tower on the New Year Eve at midnight.webm|thumb|(video) Celebrations in 2014]]\nIn [[France]], New Year's Eve (''la Saint-Sylvestre'') is usually celebrated with a feast, ''le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre''<ref>\"[https://www.vibescout.com/fr/post/reveillon-du-nouvel le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre]\" .Vibescout.com.

A traditional type of flat pastry cake, ''la galette des rois'', made of two sheets of puff pastry, filled with ''frangipane'' (almond paste) is eaten. The cake contains a ''f\u00e8ve'', a small china doll; whomever finds it becomes king or queen and gets to wear a gold paper crown and choose his or her partner. This tradition can last up to two weeks.\n\n===Germany===\nIn [[Germany]], parties are common on New Year's Eve. Fireworks are very popular, both with individuals and at large municipal displays. 31 December and the three days leading up to it are the only four days of the year on which fireworks may be sold in Germany. Every year [[Berlin]] hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in all of Europe, attended by over a million people. The focal point is the [[Brandenburg Gate]], where midnight fireworks are centered. Germans toast the New Year with a glass of [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|Sekt]] (German sparkling wine) or champagne.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Molybdomancy]] {{lang|de|(Bleigie\u00dfen)}} is another German New Year's Eve tradition, which involves telling fortunes by the shapes made by molten lead dropped into cold water. Other auspicious actions are to touch a chimney sweep or rub some ash on your forehead for good luck and health. [[Berliner (doughnut)|Jam-filled doughnuts]] with or without alcoholic fillings are eaten. Finally a tiny [[marzipan pig]] is consumed for more good luck.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In some northern regions of Germany (e.g. [[East Frisia]]) the making of ''{{ill|Speckendicken|de}}'' (also {{lang|de|Speckdicken}}) is another tradition \u2013 people go door to door visiting their neighbors and partaking in this dish.

The version traditionally broadcast on German television was originally recorded in 1963, and was occasionally used as filler programming by [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] due to popular demand; in 1972, ''Dinner for One'' received its traditional New Year's Eve scheduling. The sketch, as well as its catchphrase \"the same procedure as every year\", are well known in German pop culture. ''Dinner for One'' is also broadcast on or around New Year's Eve in other European countries, although it is, ironically, relatively unknown in the United Kingdom.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/12/30/bvdinner30.xml | title = Gesundheit to an old favourite | author = Peake, Mike | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 30 December 2006 | accessdate = 1 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"slate-dinnerforone\">{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2005/12/the_mystery_of_dinner_for_one.html|website=Slate|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Greece===\nA midnight fireworks display is held over the historic [[Parthenon]] temple in the capital of [[Athens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38477734|title=World celebrations ring in new year|work=BBC News|date=2017-01-01|access-date=2020-01-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nA common tradition among [[Greek Orthodox]] families is the cutting of a [[vasilopita]] (\"King's pie\" or \"St. Basil's pie\") at midnight.

The accompanying beverage is traditionally beer (commonly either Christmas beer or lager beer). Dessert will often be vanilla pudding or rice cream, and there will be cakes and coffee later in the evening \u2013 commonly accompanied by a glass of cognac. Then, at close to 12 am on New Year's Day, people will go outside to send up fireworks. Fireworks are only permitted to be sold to the general public on the days leading up to New Year's Eve, and only to be launched that night.\n\nDue to the general use of fireworks, more fires occur on New Year's Eve than on any other day of the year in Norway.

The tradition is to drink champagne and eat twelve raisins \u2013 one for each month of the year, making a wish for each. Another Portuguese tradition is a special cake called ''[[Bolo-Rei]]'' (literally: King Cake). ''Bolo-Rei'' is a round cake with a large hole in the centre, resembling a crown covered with crystallised and dried fruit. It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and crystallised fruit. Inside is hidden the characteristic ''fava'' ([[broad bean]]). Tradition dictates that whoever finds the ''fava'' has to pay for the ''Bolo-Rei'' next year. Initially, a small prize (usually a small metal toy) was also included within the cake. However, the inclusion of the prize was forbidden by the European Union for safety reasons. The Portuguese brought the recipe of the ''[[Gateau des Rois]]'' from France in the second half of the 19th century. To this day, this recipe is a very well kept secret.\n\nIn [[Lisbon]] the New Year is celebrated with a grand concert. The New Year's Concert is held at the CCB ([[Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m]]) on the evening of 1 January, featuring the prestigious Lisbon Metropolitan Orchestra.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Vanghelion.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Romexpo]] indoors during ''Vanghelion'' New Year's Eve party.]]\nTraditional celebrations of New Year's Eve (''Revelion'') are the norm in [[Romania]]. Romanians follow centuries-old customs, rituals, and conventions. Children sing \"[[Plugu\u0219orul]]\" and \"Sorcova\", traditional carols that wish goodwill, happiness and success.\n\nParties are common in the evening. Since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Romanians have gathered in the [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]] in [[Bucharest]]. Other significant parties occur in [[Pia\u021ba Constitu\u021biei]].

The practices date back to the early 20th century: due to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]'s stance of [[state atheism]] and a larger series of [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|anti-religious policies]], the celebration of Christmas and other religious holidays was widely discouraged. In particular, [[Christmas tree]]s were singled out for originating from [[World War I]] enemy [[Germany]], and being a symbol of the [[bourgeoisie]]. In 1935, Soviet politician [[Pavel Postyshev]] and other high-ranking officials began to promote the concept of New Year trees as a wide, secular tradition\u2014representing happiness and prosperity among youth. Even with the reinstatement of religious holidays after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Novy God has remained a popular celebration in modern Russia.<ref name=\"Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996\">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/father-frost-and-the-snow-maiden-deliver-russias-winter-warmer-1316564.html| title=Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996| accessdate=12 December 2010| newspaper=The Independent| location=London| date=31 December 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/9424/yolka-russia-new-year-tree-pagan-soviet-christmas|title=Yolka: the story of Russia's 'New Year tree', from pagan origins to Soviet celebrations|website=The Calvert Journal|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"MIG\">{{cite book|title=Echo of Islam|year=1993|publisher=MIG|quote=In the former Soviet Union, fir trees were usually put up to mark New Year's day, following a tradition established by the officially atheist state.}}</ref><ref name=\"Dice2009\">{{cite book|last=Dice|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Christmas and Hanukkah|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438119717|page=44|quote=The Christmas tree, or Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era.

Indoors, families celebrate New Year's Eve with an abundance of food. Serbs decorate trees, ''Novogodi\u0161nja jelka'', at New Year's Eve, rather than at Christmas Eve. Near, or after midnight, Santa Claus (''Deda Mraz'') visits houses and leaves presents under the tree, to be unpacked then or, if the family is asleep, to be discovered in the morning.\n\nSerbian New Year's celebrations take place in [[Belgrade]], and several other major cities such as [[Novi Sad]] and [[Ni\u0161]]. As of mid-December, cities are extensively decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the influence of the [[Julian calendar]]. Throughout the region, especially amongst former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics, Belgrade is the most popular destination for major parties.\n\nOn 13 January, a large part of the population{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} celebrates \"[[Old New Year|Serbian New Year]]\", according to the Julian calendar. Usually, one concert is organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament in Belgrade, while fireworks are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]], where people also gather. Other cities also organize such celebrations.\n\n===Slovenia===\nIn [[Slovenia]], New Year's Eve is known as a Saint Sylvester's Day (Silvestrovo). Streets are decorated for December. In larger cities like [[Ljubljana]], [[Maribor]], [[Celje]] or [[Koper]] there are concerts, culture programmes and countdowns followed by fireworks. There is also a special programme on national TV. Tradition is that the family comes together and has dinner. At midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health. People have already decorated the Christmas tree before Christmas and children are waiting for the third \"Goodman of December \u2013 Dedek Mraz.\"\n\n===Spain===\n[[File:Nochevieja puertadelsol 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]]'s [[Puerta del Sol]] on New Year's Eve, 2005.]]\nSpanish New Year's Eve (''Nochevieja'' or ''Fin de A\u00f1o'') celebrations usually begin with a family dinner, traditionally including [[shrimp]] or [[prawns]], and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[capon]]. The actual countdown is primarily followed from the clock on top of the [[Royal House of the Post Office]] in [[Puerta del Sol]] Square in [[Madrid]]. It is traditional to eat [[Twelve Grapes]], one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909 when grape growers in [[Alicante]] thought of it as a way to cut down on the large production surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet each other and toast with sparkling wine such as [[Cava (Spanish wine)|cava]], [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] or [[cider]]. The song \"Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s\" by the Spanish group [[Mecano]], is frequently played. The event is broadcast live on major Spanish networks including [[Antena 3 (Spanish TV channel)|Antena 3]] and [[Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|RTVE]].\n\nEarlier in the evening at around 20:00, there is a 10k run called [[San Silvestre Vallecana]], which starts on [[Paseo de la Castellana]], next to [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]], and ends at the [[Campo de F\u00fatbol de Vallecas|Vallecas Stadium]].  Professional runners come to Madrid for this 10k.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAfter the family dinner and the grapes, many young people attend ''cotillones de nochevieja'' parties (named for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''cotill\u00f3n'', which refers to party supplies like confetti, party blowers, and party hats) at pubs, clubs, and similar places. Parties usually last until the next morning and range from small, personal celebrations at local bars to huge parties with guests numbering the thousands at hotel convention rooms. Early the next morning, party attendees usually gather to have the traditional winter breakfast of hot chocolate and fried pastry (''chocolate con [[churro]]s'').\n\n===Sweden===\n[[File:New Years Eve 2008-2009 -1.jpg|thumb|[[Gothenburg]] fireworks on New Year's Eve, 2008.]]\nIn [[Sweden]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with families or with friends. A few hours before and after midnight, people usually party and eat a special dinner, often three courses. New Year's Eve is celebrated with large fireworks displays throughout the country, especially in the cities. People over the age of 18 are allowed to buy fireworks, which are sold by local stores or by private people. While watching or lighting fireworks at midnight, people usually drink champagne. The Swedish lottery television show ''[[BingoLotto]]'' features a special New Year's Eve edition to commemorate the holiday.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn [[Switzerland]], New Year's Eve is typically celebrated in private gatherings or public events.\n\nThe final of the [[Spengler Cup]] ice hockey tournament is traditionally held on New Year's Eve.\n\n===Turkey===\n[[File:Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], Istanbul.]]\n[[File:Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 2010-11 Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131 S\u00fcslemeleri.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]], [[\u0130stanbul]].]]\nNumerous decorations and customs traditionally associated with Christmas and [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayrams]] are part of [[secular]] New Year's Eve celebrations in [[Turkey]]. Homes and streets are lit in glittering lights. Small gifts are exchanged, and large family dinners are organized with family and friends, featuring a special [[Stuffed turkey|turkey]] dish stuffed with a [[zante currant]], [[pine nuts]], [[pimiento]] and [[dill]] ''[[pilaf|i\u00e7 pilav]]'', [[dolma]], hot [[b\u00f6rek]], [[baklava]], and various other [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish dishes]], accompanied with [[rak\u0131]], [[Turkish wine]], or [[boza]], [[Sharbat|\u015ferbet]], [[salep]], and [[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee|coffee]]. Even though Turkish people generally do not celebrate [[Christmas]], decorating Christmas trees is a very popular tradition on New Year's Eve in Turkey, and the Turks associate [[Santa Claus]] with New Year's Eve.\n\nTelevision and radio channels are known to continuously broadcast a variety of special New Year's Eve programs, while [[Municipality|municipalities]] all around the country organize fundraising events for the poor, in addition to celebratory public shows such as concerts and family-friendly events, as well as more traditional forms of entertainment such as the [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] [[shadow theatre|shadow-theater]], and even performances by the [[Mehter]]\u2014the [[Janissary]] Band that was founded during the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPublic and private parties with large public attendances are organised in a number of cities and towns, particularly in the largest metropolitan areas such as [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[Izmir]], [[Adana]], [[Bursa]] and [[Antalya]], with the biggest celebrations taking place in Istanbul's [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[Beyo\u011flu]], [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]] and [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] districts and Ankara's [[K\u0131z\u0131lay Square]], which generally feature dancing, concerts, laser and light shows as well as the traditional countdown and fireworks display.\n\n===Ukraine===\n[[File:Christmas tree in Kyiv, 2019-2020.jpg|thumb|New Year celebration in [[Kiev]]]]\nIn the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, New Year's has the same cultural significance as Christmas has in the United States, but without the religious connotations. Ukrainian families traditionally install spruce trees at home, the equivalent of a Christmas tree. Families gather to eat a large feast and reflect on the past year. They have a large celebration, make toasts, and make wishes for a happy New Year. Families give presents to their friends as well as informal acquaintances. As Ukrainians are traditionally a closely-knit community, it is seen as a taboo to not give presents to those the family associates with. Children stay up until midnight, waiting for the New Year. During these celebrations, many Ukrainians tune to special New Year shows, which have become a long-standing tradition for Ukrainian TV. And just before midnight the [[President of Ukraine]] gives his New Year's message to the nation, and when the clock strikes 12, the National Anthem [[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]] is played in all TV and radio stations as well as in Independence Square in Kiev and other cities where holiday celebrations are held.\n\nThe first New year dish in Ukraine which associates with the New year for every Ukrainian person is the Olivier salad. It has become the main \u00abcharacter\u00bb of many jokes and anecdotes. There are several versions about where the name Olivier comes from, but most people say that it appeared thanks to the French chef Olivier, who lived in the USSR in the 1960s and was the owner of a French restaurant in Moscow. He was the first one to cook this dish. Nowadays this salad is also called Russian, potato and meat salad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diolli.com/new-year-dishes-in-ukraine/|title=New year dish - Ukrainian food - Diolli.com|date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nNew Year is often considered a \"pre-celebration\" for Greek Catholics and Eastern Orthodox living in Eastern Europe, primarily in Ukraine, since Christmas is celebrated on 7 January.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====England====\n{{Main|New Year's Eve in London}}\n[[File:LondonTrafSQNYE.jpg|thumb|right|Thousands of people gather in [[central London]] for New Year celebrations, including fireworks at the [[London Eye]] at midnight]]\nThe most prominent New Year's Eve (Old Year's Night) celebration in England is that of [[Central London]], where the arrival of midnight is greeted with the chimes of [[Big Ben]].

The celebration is focused on a major street party along [[Princes Street]]. The cannon is fired at [[Edinburgh Castle]] at the stroke of midnight, followed by a large fireworks display. Edinburgh hosts a festival of four or five days, beginning on 28 December, and lasting until New Year's Day or 2 January, which is also a [[bank holiday]] in Scotland.\n\nOther cities across Scotland, such as [[Aberdeen]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Stirling]] have large organised celebrations too, including fireworks at midnight.\n\n[[BBC Scotland]] [[Hogmanay Live|broadcast the celebrations]] in Edinburgh to a Scottish audience, with the celebrations also screened across the world.

The race celebrates the life and achievements of Welsh runner [[Guto Nyth Br\u00e2n]].\n\nFounded in 1958 by local runner Bernard Baldwin, it is run over the 5-kilometre route of Guto's first competitive race. The main race starts with a church service at [[Llanwynno]], and then a wreath is laid on Guto's grave in [[Llanwynno]] graveyard. After lighting a torch, it is carried to the nearby town of Mountain Ash, where the main race takes place.\n\nThe race consists of a double circuit of the town centre, starting in Henry Street and ending in Oxford Street, by the commemorative statue of Guto. Traditionally, the race was timed to end at midnight, but in recent times it was rescheduled for the convenience of family entertainment, now concluding at around 9 pm.\n\nThis has resulted in a growth in size and scale, and the proceedings now start with an afternoon of street entertainment, and fun run races for children, concluding with the church service, elite runners' race, and presentations.\n\n==Middle East==\n===Israel===\nNew Year's Eve (''Sylvester'') in [[Israel]], is celebrated by parties, social get togethers, concerts, and dining out in major cities such as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tel Aviv]].

The dinner features traditional dishes such as tabouli, hummus, kibbi, and other Lebanese foods. These celebrations could also take place in restaurants and clubs.

After the dinner, individuals light fireworks and continue partying outside. A radio station broadcasts a countdown to midnight. When the clock strikes midnight, fireworks are lit across the country. People start exchanging hugs and wishes for the new year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe main event takes place at midnight where fireworks are lit along with thousands of life-size effigies called \"A\u00f1o Viejo\".

The effigy represents things you disliked from the previous year and are made to look like famous celebrities, politicians, public servants, cartoons, etc. They are burnt right at midnight to shed the old year and represent a new beginning. Some of the braver Ecuadorians jump through these burning effigies 12 times to represent a wish for every month.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Guatemala===\nIn [[Guatemala]], banks close on New Year's Eve, and businesses close at noon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atozworldtravel.com/worldtravel2_country.asp?nid=20.17&next_nid=20.18&cid=58&parent=Society%20and%20Culture#NewYearsDay |title=Guatemala: Society and Culture / Holidays and Festivals |publisher=Atozworldtravel.com |accessdate=31 December 2010}}</ref> In the town of [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]], people usually gather at the Santa Catalina Clock Arch to celebrate New Year's Eve ({{lang-es|Fin del A\u00f1o}}).

Every year the length of them is compared, and high praises are held for the company that has managed to import the largest ribbon. These celebrations start at 10 am and finish the next day. The day is usually filled with laughter, dance, music, and drinking. When the night starts, the big street parties are already at full capacity. The most popular fiesta is the one that is held at caf\u00e9 't Vat in the main tourist district.

However a vigil Mass may be held on the evening before a Holy Day; thus it has become customary to celebrate Mass on the evening of New Year's Eve. (New Year's Eve is a [[Silvester|feast day]] honoring [[Pope Sylvester I]] in the Roman Catholic calendar, but it is not widely recognized in the United States.){{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMany Christian congregations have New Year's Eve [[watchnight service]]s. Some, especially [[Lutheran]]s and [[Methodist]]s and those in the [[Black church|African American community]], have a tradition known as \"Watch Night\", in which the faithful congregate in services continuing past midnight, giving thanks for the blessings of the outgoing year and praying for divine favor during the upcoming year. In the English-speaking world, Watch Night can be traced back to [[John Wesley]], the founder of Methodism,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&mid=11612|title=Watch Night services provide spiritual way to bring in New Year|publisher=The United Methodist Church Interpreter Magazine|date=November\u2013December 2006|last=Butler|first=Joey|accessdate=10 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301064835/http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&mid=11612|archivedate=1 March 2012}}</ref> who learned the custom from the [[Moravian Brethren]] who came to England in the 1730s.

In [[Caracas]], the bells of the Cathedral of Caracas ring twelve times.<ref name=\":0\" /> During these special programs, is a tradition to broadcast songs about the end of the year. It is a non-working holiday. Popular songs include \"Viejo a\u00f1o\" (\"Old year\"), by [[Gaita Zuliana|Gaita]] group [[Maracaibo 15]], and \"Cinco pa' las 12\" (\"Five minutes before twelve\"), which was versioned by several popular singers including Nestor Zavarce, Nancy Ramos and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez El Puma]]. The unofficial hymn for the first minutes of the New Year is \"A\u00f1o Nuevo, Vida Nueva\" (\"New Year, New Life\"), by the band Billo's Caracas Boys. Many people play the national anthem in their houses.\n\nTraditions include wearing yellow underwear, eating [[Pan de jam\u00f3n]], and 12 grapes with sparkling wine.\n\nSpecial holiday programs are broadcast on Venezuelan television stations including [[Venevision]].\n\n==Asia==\n===Bangladesh===\nThe New Year celebrations take place in all around the country mostly in [[Dhaka]], [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Khulna]], [[Barishal]], [[Cox's Bazar]] etc. The celebrations mostly take place at night.

The [[Christians]] go to the churches for a watch night service till midnight, praying for blessing in the coming new year as it is also part of the [[Christmastide]] season observances.\n\n===China===\nIn [[China]], although the celebrations of the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]] are not until a few weeks after the Gregorian New Year, celebrations of the Gregorian New Year are held in some areas, particularly in major cities. For example, celebrations with fireworks and rock concerts have taken place in [[Beijing]]'s Solana Blue Harbor Shopping Park, while cultural shows and other events are held at the city's Millennium Monument, [[Temple of Heaven]], [[Great Wall of China]], [[Olympic Green]], and the [[Summer Palace]]. Since 2011, a light and sound show has been held at [[The Bund (Shanghai)|The Bund]] in [[Shanghai]], a few minutes before midnight.\n\n====Hong Kong====\n[[File:HK NYE.jpg|thumb|Fireworks display in [[Hong Kong]].]]\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], many gather in shopping districts like [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Causeway Bay]] and [[Tsim Sha Tsui]]. Beginning in 2008, a 60-second numerical countdown to New Year's, consisting of [[LED]] lights and pyrotechnic display effects, on the facade of [[Two International Finance Centre]] was launched, followed by a fireworks display, alongside an exhibition of the [[A Symphony of Lights|Symphony of Lights]]. For the arrival of 2013, the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]] initiated the countdown, while the fireworks display and A Symphony of Lights show were extended to eight minutes.\n\nShopping malls are often major celebration venues. The [[Times Square (Hong Kong)|Times Square]] shopping mall, for instance, holds their own celebration of the ball drop held at [[Times Square]], [[New York City]]. There are also various district-wide celebrations.\n\n===Central Asia===\nIn [[Central Asia]], New Year's Eve celebrations were inherited from Soviet traditions; thus they are similar to those of Russia. An example of such traditions would be the playing of the national anthem at midnight and the presidential address before it.\n\n===India===\nIn India as a land of diverse cultures and practices, apart from the Gregorian new year, there is Parsi New Year, Hindu New Year(which might differ from region to region), Muslim New Year, etc. Celebration for culture-specific new years is different from the celebrations of the Gregorian new year. Gregorian new year celebration is mostly by way of parties late night and a working holiday followed by it. Most celebrations for December 31 take place in the major metropolitan cities like [[Kochi]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]], [[Pune]], [[Ahmedabad]]. New Year is also celebrated in other cities and towns around the country like [[Agra]], [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Cuttack]], [[Vadodara]], etc., There are lots of shows, events, awards and parties organized all over India. Big and small celebrities and personalities perform as well as enjoy in these parties. Many Discos and Pubs organize big singers, DJs or local talent to liven up the night with their music and songs.

Many people across the country also follow old traditions. The[[Christians|Christian]] community often go to church for a watch night service till midnight praying for blessing in the coming new year.\n\n===Indonesia===\nNew Year's Eve celebrations in [[Medan]] ([[Capital city|capital]] of [[North Sumatra]]), included the [[:id:Dunia Terbalik|Dunia Terbalik New Year Countdown Celebrations fireworks]] which was part of the event called \"[[Pelita Harapan University|Medan Pelita Harapan University]] Down Eve Countdown.\" The event, which celebrated the arrival of 2018, attracted 400,000 spectators along both sides of the [[CIMB Niaga]]. The [[countdown]] was televised live in [[Indonesia]] via [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] [[high-definition television|high-definition]] on [[satellite television|satellite transmission]], and aired on [[RCTI|RCTI HD]]'s [[:id:Dunia Terbalik|Dunia Terbalik]] and was sponsored by [[Charoen Pokphand Foods|Fiesta Black Tea]]. It included various national performances such as the \"Dunia Terbalik All Star\" performance, which reached more than 1.9 million viewers. Over 200 local and overseas media organizations covered the spectacular that generated a publicity value of more than [[Indonesian rupiah|RP]]1000 million.\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|\u014cmisoka}}\n[[File:Tokyo Tower in New Year's Eve 2012.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Tokyo Tower on New Year's Eve, 2012]]\nIn [[Japan]], New Year's Eve is used to prepare for and welcome ''Toshigami'' (\u5e74\u795e), the New Year's god. People clean their home and prepare [[Kadomatsu]] or [[Shimenawa]] to welcome the god before New Year's Eve. Buddhist temples ring their bells 108 times<ref name=telegraph/> at midnight in the traditional ''Joya no Kane'' (\u9664\u591c\u306e\u9418). The rings represent the 108 elements of ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|bon\u014d]]'' (\u7169\u60a9), mental states that lead people to take unwholesome actions.\n\nIn most cities and urban areas across Japan, New Year's Eve celebrations are usually accompanied by concerts, countdowns, fireworks and other events. In [[Tokyo]], the two most crowded celebrations are held at the Shibuya crossing in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] and the [[Z\u014dj\u014d-ji|Zojoji Temple]] in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]. People gather around the Zojoji Temple to release helium balloons with New Year's wishes up in the sky and watch the lighting of [[Tokyo Tower]] and [[Tokyo Skytree]] with a year number displayed on the observatory at the stroke of midnight.\n\nThree notable music-oriented television specials air near New Year's Eve. Since 1951, [[NHK]] has traditionally broadcast ''[[K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]]'' (''Red and White Song Battle'') on New Year's Eve, a music competition where two teams of popular musicians (the red and white teams, which predominantly contain female and male performers respectively) perform songs, with the winning team determined by a panel of judges and televotes. The special is traditionally one of the most-watched television programs of the year in Japan. Although it did air on 31 December from 1959 to 2006, the [[Japan Record Award]]s ceremony, recognizing outstanding achievements in the [[Music of Japan|Japanese music industry]], is held annually on 30 December since 2007 and is broadcast by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]. Since 1996, [[Fuji Television]] has broadcast ''Johnny's Countdown''\u2014a live concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]] organized by the talent agency [[Johnny & Associates]].\n\n===Korea===\nThere are two New Years celebrated in both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], which are Lunar New Year and Solar New Year. The Solar New Year are always celebrated on the first day of January while Lunar New Year varies. Sometimes there are some traits that both North and South Korea celebrate, while some traits are celebrated differently or only on one side.\n\nIn both Koreas, they call New Year's Day \uc124\ub0a0 (Seoll-Nal). They eat a special soup called \ub5a1\uad6d (Tteok-Guk) which is a hot soup with thin, flat rice cakes and most of the times, eggs are inserted. The Koreans believe that one would get to earn one age if the soup is eaten New Year's Day. They say if one dares to not eat the soup on New Year's Day, then he or she will lose luck.\n\nMost cities and urban areas in both Koreas host New Year's Eve gatherings. In South Korea, two of the biggest celebrations take place in [[Seoul]]: the ringing of [[Bosingak]] bell 33 times at midnight and fireworks display at [[Myeong-dong]], and an LED laser light show and fireworks display at the [[Lotte World Tower]] in [[Songpa District|Songpa-gu]]. In [[Pyongyang]], North Korea, the chimes of the clock at the Grand People's Study House and the national fireworks display along [[Kim Il-sung Square]], [[Juche Tower]] and the surrounding areas signal the start of the New Year. The celebration in Pyongyang, however, also marks the beginning of the [[North Korean calendar]] or the Juche Year, which is based on 15 April 1912, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s date of birth, the celebrations are more recent in origin with the fireworks displays dating from 2013.\n\nFor 2018-2019, Kim Il-sung Square held its first large-scale public celebration, which featured a concert performance by the state [[Moranbong Band]], midnight fireworks, and a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] light show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/12/north-korea-rings-in-new-year-with-midnight-concert-drone-show/|title=North Korea rings in new year with midnight concert, drone show|date=1 January 2019|website=NK News|language=en-US|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\n[[File:2018 New Year Fireworks in George Town, Penang.jpg|left|thumb|Fireworks in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]] on 1 January 2018]]\n[[File:MALAM TAHUN BARU (5309956791).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fireworks in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia]]\n''Ambang Tahun Baru'', a celebration sponsored by the government was held at [[Dataran Merdeka|Merdeka Square]], the field opposite the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]] in the [[Malaysia]]n capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the early days.

As a modern tradition, New Year's Eve as well as New Year's Day are public holidays, and are two of the biggest holidays of the year. They celebrate New Year's Eve with their family. It is common, just like in the former Soviet Union, that the [[National Anthem of Mongolia]] is to be played at the midnight hour on television.\n\n===Pakistan===\nNew Year's Eve is usually celebrated with fireworks in big cities (e.g. [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]]).

[[Filipino people|Filipinos]] usually celebrate New Year's Eve in the company of family or close friends. Traditionally, most households would visit the churches and attend year-end service and afterwards, would host or attend a midnight feast called the ''Media Noche''. Typical dishes included holiday fare, ''[[pancit]]'' (for long life) and ''[[Jam\u00f3n|Ham\u00f3n]]''. ''[[Lechon]]'' (roasted pig), is usually prepared, as is barbecued food. Some refrain from serving chicken, as their scratching and pecking for food is unlucky, being an idiom for a hand-to-mouth existence.\n\nMany opt to wear new, bright, or colourful clothes with circular patterns, such as [[polka dot]]s, or display sweets and twelve round fruits as the centrepiece, in the belief that circles attract money and fortune and that candies represent a sweeter year ahead. Several customs must only be done at midnight: some throw about coins to increase wealth in the coming year, or jump to increase their height, while some follow the [[Spanish influence on Filipino culture|Spanish custom]] of eating twelve grapes, one for each month of the year. People also make loud noises by blowing on cardboard or plastic horns, called ''torotot'', banging on pots and pans, playing loud music, blowing car horns, or by igniting firecrackers, in the belief that the din scares away bad luck and evil spirits. [[Bamboo cannon]]s are also fired on the night in some places.\n\nUrban areas usually host many New Year's Eve parties and countdown celebrations hosted by the private sector with the help of the local government. These parties, which include balls hosted by hotels, usually display their own fireworks and are often very well-attended. Within Metro Manila, popular locations for celebrations include the area along [[Manila Bay]] at [[Roxas Boulevard]] or [[Luneta Park]] in [[Manila]], the intersection of Ayala and Makati Avenues in [[Makati City]], [[Resorts World Manila]] and [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay City]], [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] in Diliman and [[Eastwood City]] in Libis, [[Quezon City]], [[Bonifacio Global City]] in [[Taguig City]], [[Entertainment City]] in [[Para\u00f1aque|Para\u00f1aque City]], and the [[Philippine Arena]] at [[Ciudad de Victoria]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]] and [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]], [[Bulacan]].

(23741249829).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Prague]] New Year Fireworks]]\nNew Year's Eve (''Silvestr/Silvester'') celebrations and traditions in [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] are very similar. New Year's Eve is the noisiest day of the year. People generally gather with friends at parties, in pubs, clubs, in the streets, or city squares to eat, drink, and celebrate the new year. Fireworks are a popular tradition; in large cities such as [[Bratislava]], or [[Prague]], the fireworks start before noon and steadily increase until midnight. In the first minutes after midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health, and go outside for the fireworks.\n\nIn both countries all major TV stations air entertainment shows before and after the midnight countdown, which is followed by the National anthem of each country. The Presidents of the republics gave their [[New Year speech]] in the morning \u2013 the new Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman renewed the tradition of Christmas speeches. In recent years however the Czechoslovak national anthem is played at midnight, in honor of the shared history of both nations.\n\n===Denmark===\n[[File:CopenhagenNYE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|New Year fireworks over [[Copenhagen]]]]\nPeople in [[Denmark]] may go to parties or entertain guests at home.

These are lucky numbers in Estonia; it is believed that for each meal consumed, the person gains the strength of that many men the following year. Meals should not be completely finished\u2014some food should be left for ancestors and spirits who visit the house on New Year's Eve.\n\nTraditional New Year food includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes and swedes with hog's head, and white and blood sausage. Vegetarians can eat potato salad with navy beet{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and p\u00e2t\u00e9. Gingerbread and marzipan are very popular for dessert. Traditional New Year drinks include beer and mead, but mulled wine and champagne have become modern favourites.\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with family or friends. Late supper is served, often featuring wieners, [[Janssons frestelse]], and potato salad. Some municipalities organize fireworks at midnight. Consumer fireworks are also very popular. A Finnish tradition is [[molybdomancy]] \u2013 to tell the fortunes of the New Year by melting \"tin\" (actually lead) in a tiny pan on the stove and throwing it quickly in a bucket of cold water. The resulting blob of metal is analyzed, for example by interpreting shadows it casts by candlelight. These predictions are however never taken seriously.\n\nThe Finnish Broadcasting Company broadcasts the reception of the New Year at [[Helsinki Senate Square]]. Countdown to New Year is with the [[Helsinki Cathedral]] clock. In the afternoon programme, the German comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]'' is shown every year. On the radio, just before midnight, the poem ''Hymyilev\u00e4 Apollo'' (Smiling Apollo) by [[Eino Leino]] is read.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |title=Eino Leino |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170013/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |archivedate=5 March 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Eiffel Tower on the New Year Eve at midnight.webm|thumb|(video) Celebrations in 2014]]\nIn [[France]], New Year's Eve (''la Saint-Sylvestre'') is usually celebrated with a feast, ''le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre''<ref>\"[https://www.vibescout.com/fr/post/reveillon-du-nouvel le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre]\" .Vibescout.com.

The celebration can be a simple, intimate dinner with friends and family or, ''une soir\u00e9e dansante'', a much fancier ball.\n\nOn New Year's Day (''le Jour de l'An'') friends and family exchange [[New Year's resolutions]], kisses, and wishes. Some people eat [[ice cream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/france/new-year-day|title=New Year's Day in France}}</ref>\n\nThe holiday period ends on 6 January with the celebration of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] (''Jour des Rois''). A traditional type of flat pastry cake, ''la galette des rois'', made of two sheets of puff pastry, filled with ''frangipane'' (almond paste) is eaten. The cake contains a ''f\u00e8ve'', a small china doll; whomever finds it becomes king or queen and gets to wear a gold paper crown and choose his or her partner. This tradition can last up to two weeks.\n\n===Germany===\nIn [[Germany]], parties are common on New Year's Eve. Fireworks are very popular, both with individuals and at large municipal displays. 31 December and the three days leading up to it are the only four days of the year on which fireworks may be sold in Germany. Every year [[Berlin]] hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in all of Europe, attended by over a million people. The focal point is the [[Brandenburg Gate]], where midnight fireworks are centered. Germans toast the New Year with a glass of [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|Sekt]] (German sparkling wine) or champagne.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Molybdomancy]] {{lang|de|(Bleigie\u00dfen)}} is another German New Year's Eve tradition, which involves telling fortunes by the shapes made by molten lead dropped into cold water. Other auspicious actions are to touch a chimney sweep or rub some ash on your forehead for good luck and health. [[Berliner (doughnut)|Jam-filled doughnuts]] with or without alcoholic fillings are eaten. Finally a tiny [[marzipan pig]] is consumed for more good luck.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In some northern regions of Germany (e.g. [[East Frisia]]) the making of ''{{ill|Speckendicken|de}}'' (also {{lang|de|Speckdicken}}) is another tradition \u2013 people go door to door visiting their neighbors and partaking in this dish.

The version traditionally broadcast on German television was originally recorded in 1963, and was occasionally used as filler programming by [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] due to popular demand; in 1972, ''Dinner for One'' received its traditional New Year's Eve scheduling. The sketch, as well as its catchphrase \"the same procedure as every year\", are well known in German pop culture. ''Dinner for One'' is also broadcast on or around New Year's Eve in other European countries, although it is, ironically, relatively unknown in the United Kingdom.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/12/30/bvdinner30.xml | title = Gesundheit to an old favourite | author = Peake, Mike | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 30 December 2006 | accessdate = 1 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"slate-dinnerforone\">{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2005/12/the_mystery_of_dinner_for_one.html|website=Slate|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Greece===\nA midnight fireworks display is held over the historic [[Parthenon]] temple in the capital of [[Athens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38477734|title=World celebrations ring in new year|work=BBC News|date=2017-01-01|access-date=2020-01-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nA common tradition among [[Greek Orthodox]] families is the cutting of a [[vasilopita]] (\"King's pie\" or \"St. Basil's pie\") at midnight.

An ancient tradition in southern regions which is rarely followed today was disposing of old or unused items by dropping them from the window.\n\nDinner is traditionally eaten with relatives and friends. It often includes [[zampone]] or [[cotechino]] (a meal made with [[pig's trotters]] or entrails), and lentils. At 20:30, the President reads a television message of greetings to Italians.\n\nAt midnight, fireworks are displayed all across the country. Rarely followed today is the tradition that consist in eating [[lentil]] stew when bell tolls midnight, one spoonful per bell. This is supposed to bring good fortune; the round lentils represent coins.\n\n===Malta===\n[[Malta]] organized its first New Year's street party in 2009 in [[Floriana]].

New Year's Day is celebrated by day-long fireworks shows. The day is celebrated together with family or friends at home or in restaurants, clubs, caf\u00e9s and hotels. During the day-time celebration, children get gifts. Evening celebrations include food, music, and dancing to both traditional Macedonian folk music, and modern music. New Year's Eve is celebrated on 31 December and also on 14 January according to the Macedonian Orthodox Calendar.\n\n===Norway===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nIn [[Norway]] New Year's Eve (''Nytt\u00e5rsaften'') is the second biggest celebration of the year, after [[Christmas Eve]]. While Christmas Eve is a family celebration, New Year's Eve is an opportunity to celebrate with friends.\n\nTraditionally, there is first a feast, commonly consisting of stuffed, roast turkey with potatoes, sprouts, gravy and [[Waldorf salad]]. The accompanying beverage is traditionally beer (commonly either Christmas beer or lager beer). Dessert will often be vanilla pudding or rice cream, and there will be cakes and coffee later in the evening \u2013 commonly accompanied by a glass of cognac. Then, at close to 12 am on New Year's Day, people will go outside to send up fireworks. Fireworks are only permitted to be sold to the general public on the days leading up to New Year's Eve, and only to be launched that night.\n\nDue to the general use of fireworks, more fires occur on New Year's Eve than on any other day of the year in Norway. Accordingly, most Norwegian cities, and many towns, host a large, public fireworks display in order to discourage private use of fireworks in built-up areas. People will then congregate in a central square or similar to watch and celebrate.\n\n===Poland===\nIn [[Poland]] New Year's Eve (''Sylwester'') celebrations include both indoor and outdoor festivities. A large open-air concert is held in the [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Square]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. 150,000 to 200,000 revelers celebrate the New Year with live music and a fireworks display over [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|St. Mary's Basilica]].<ref name=\"onet\">{{cite web|last=\u015awierczek|first=Marcin|title=Tylko w Onet.tv \u2013 sylwester z krakowskiego Rynku na \u017cywo!|publisher=[[Onet.tv]] from Polish Press Agency|location=[[Krak\u00f3w]]|year=2008|url=http://muzyka.onet.pl/10172,1888447,newsy.html|accessdate=31 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117013012/http://muzyka.onet.pl/10172,1888447,newsy.html|archivedate=17 January 2009}}</ref> Similar festivities are held in other cities around Poland.\n\nFor those who do not wish to spend the New Year in the city, the mountains are a popular destination.

The tradition is to drink champagne and eat twelve raisins \u2013 one for each month of the year, making a wish for each. Another Portuguese tradition is a special cake called ''[[Bolo-Rei]]'' (literally: King Cake). ''Bolo-Rei'' is a round cake with a large hole in the centre, resembling a crown covered with crystallised and dried fruit. It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and crystallised fruit. Inside is hidden the characteristic ''fava'' ([[broad bean]]). Tradition dictates that whoever finds the ''fava'' has to pay for the ''Bolo-Rei'' next year. Initially, a small prize (usually a small metal toy) was also included within the cake. However, the inclusion of the prize was forbidden by the European Union for safety reasons. The Portuguese brought the recipe of the ''[[Gateau des Rois]]'' from France in the second half of the 19th century. To this day, this recipe is a very well kept secret.\n\nIn [[Lisbon]] the New Year is celebrated with a grand concert. The New Year's Concert is held at the CCB ([[Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m]]) on the evening of 1 January, featuring the prestigious Lisbon Metropolitan Orchestra.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Vanghelion.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Romexpo]] indoors during ''Vanghelion'' New Year's Eve party.]]\nTraditional celebrations of New Year's Eve (''Revelion'') are the norm in [[Romania]].

Children sing \"[[Plugu\u0219orul]]\" and \"Sorcova\", traditional carols that wish goodwill, happiness and success.\n\nParties are common in the evening. Since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Romanians have gathered in the [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]] in [[Bucharest]]. Other significant parties occur in [[Pia\u021ba Constitu\u021biei]].

The practices date back to the early 20th century: due to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]'s stance of [[state atheism]] and a larger series of [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|anti-religious policies]], the celebration of Christmas and other religious holidays was widely discouraged. In particular, [[Christmas tree]]s were singled out for originating from [[World War I]] enemy [[Germany]], and being a symbol of the [[bourgeoisie]]. In 1935, Soviet politician [[Pavel Postyshev]] and other high-ranking officials began to promote the concept of New Year trees as a wide, secular tradition\u2014representing happiness and prosperity among youth. Even with the reinstatement of religious holidays after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Novy God has remained a popular celebration in modern Russia.<ref name=\"Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996\">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/father-frost-and-the-snow-maiden-deliver-russias-winter-warmer-1316564.html| title=Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996| accessdate=12 December 2010| newspaper=The Independent| location=London| date=31 December 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/9424/yolka-russia-new-year-tree-pagan-soviet-christmas|title=Yolka: the story of Russia's 'New Year tree', from pagan origins to Soviet celebrations|website=The Calvert Journal|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"MIG\">{{cite book|title=Echo of Islam|year=1993|publisher=MIG|quote=In the former Soviet Union, fir trees were usually put up to mark New Year's day, following a tradition established by the officially atheist state.}}</ref><ref name=\"Dice2009\">{{cite book|last=Dice|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Christmas and Hanukkah|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438119717|page=44|quote=The Christmas tree, or Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era.

Indoors, families celebrate New Year's Eve with an abundance of food. Serbs decorate trees, ''Novogodi\u0161nja jelka'', at New Year's Eve, rather than at Christmas Eve. Near, or after midnight, Santa Claus (''Deda Mraz'') visits houses and leaves presents under the tree, to be unpacked then or, if the family is asleep, to be discovered in the morning.\n\nSerbian New Year's celebrations take place in [[Belgrade]], and several other major cities such as [[Novi Sad]] and [[Ni\u0161]]. As of mid-December, cities are extensively decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the influence of the [[Julian calendar]]. Throughout the region, especially amongst former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics, Belgrade is the most popular destination for major parties.\n\nOn 13 January, a large part of the population{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} celebrates \"[[Old New Year|Serbian New Year]]\", according to the Julian calendar. Usually, one concert is organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament in Belgrade, while fireworks are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]], where people also gather. Other cities also organize such celebrations.\n\n===Slovenia===\nIn [[Slovenia]], New Year's Eve is known as a Saint Sylvester's Day (Silvestrovo). Streets are decorated for December. In larger cities like [[Ljubljana]], [[Maribor]], [[Celje]] or [[Koper]] there are concerts, culture programmes and countdowns followed by fireworks. There is also a special programme on national TV. Tradition is that the family comes together and has dinner. At midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health. People have already decorated the Christmas tree before Christmas and children are waiting for the third \"Goodman of December \u2013 Dedek Mraz.\"\n\n===Spain===\n[[File:Nochevieja puertadelsol 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]]'s [[Puerta del Sol]] on New Year's Eve, 2005.]]\nSpanish New Year's Eve (''Nochevieja'' or ''Fin de A\u00f1o'') celebrations usually begin with a family dinner, traditionally including [[shrimp]] or [[prawns]], and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[capon]]. The actual countdown is primarily followed from the clock on top of the [[Royal House of the Post Office]] in [[Puerta del Sol]] Square in [[Madrid]]. It is traditional to eat [[Twelve Grapes]], one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909 when grape growers in [[Alicante]] thought of it as a way to cut down on the large production surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet each other and toast with sparkling wine such as [[Cava (Spanish wine)|cava]], [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] or [[cider]]. The song \"Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s\" by the Spanish group [[Mecano]], is frequently played. The event is broadcast live on major Spanish networks including [[Antena 3 (Spanish TV channel)|Antena 3]] and [[Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|RTVE]].\n\nEarlier in the evening at around 20:00, there is a 10k run called [[San Silvestre Vallecana]], which starts on [[Paseo de la Castellana]], next to [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]], and ends at the [[Campo de F\u00fatbol de Vallecas|Vallecas Stadium]].  Professional runners come to Madrid for this 10k.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAfter the family dinner and the grapes, many young people attend ''cotillones de nochevieja'' parties (named for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''cotill\u00f3n'', which refers to party supplies like confetti, party blowers, and party hats) at pubs, clubs, and similar places. Parties usually last until the next morning and range from small, personal celebrations at local bars to huge parties with guests numbering the thousands at hotel convention rooms. Early the next morning, party attendees usually gather to have the traditional winter breakfast of hot chocolate and fried pastry (''chocolate con [[churro]]s'').\n\n===Sweden===\n[[File:New Years Eve 2008-2009 -1.jpg|thumb|[[Gothenburg]] fireworks on New Year's Eve, 2008.]]\nIn [[Sweden]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with families or with friends. A few hours before and after midnight, people usually party and eat a special dinner, often three courses. New Year's Eve is celebrated with large fireworks displays throughout the country, especially in the cities. People over the age of 18 are allowed to buy fireworks, which are sold by local stores or by private people. While watching or lighting fireworks at midnight, people usually drink champagne. The Swedish lottery television show ''[[BingoLotto]]'' features a special New Year's Eve edition to commemorate the holiday.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn [[Switzerland]], New Year's Eve is typically celebrated in private gatherings or public events.\n\nThe final of the [[Spengler Cup]] ice hockey tournament is traditionally held on New Year's Eve.\n\n===Turkey===\n[[File:Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], Istanbul.]]\n[[File:Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 2010-11 Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131 S\u00fcslemeleri.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]], [[\u0130stanbul]].]]\nNumerous decorations and customs traditionally associated with Christmas and [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayrams]] are part of [[secular]] New Year's Eve celebrations in [[Turkey]]. Homes and streets are lit in glittering lights. Small gifts are exchanged, and large family dinners are organized with family and friends, featuring a special [[Stuffed turkey|turkey]] dish stuffed with a [[zante currant]], [[pine nuts]], [[pimiento]] and [[dill]] ''[[pilaf|i\u00e7 pilav]]'', [[dolma]], hot [[b\u00f6rek]], [[baklava]], and various other [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish dishes]], accompanied with [[rak\u0131]], [[Turkish wine]], or [[boza]], [[Sharbat|\u015ferbet]], [[salep]], and [[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee|coffee]]. Even though Turkish people generally do not celebrate [[Christmas]], decorating Christmas trees is a very popular tradition on New Year's Eve in Turkey, and the Turks associate [[Santa Claus]] with New Year's Eve.\n\nTelevision and radio channels are known to continuously broadcast a variety of special New Year's Eve programs, while [[Municipality|municipalities]] all around the country organize fundraising events for the poor, in addition to celebratory public shows such as concerts and family-friendly events, as well as more traditional forms of entertainment such as the [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] [[shadow theatre|shadow-theater]], and even performances by the [[Mehter]]\u2014the [[Janissary]] Band that was founded during the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPublic and private parties with large public attendances are organised in a number of cities and towns, particularly in the largest metropolitan areas such as [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[Izmir]], [[Adana]], [[Bursa]] and [[Antalya]], with the biggest celebrations taking place in Istanbul's [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[Beyo\u011flu]], [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]] and [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] districts and Ankara's [[K\u0131z\u0131lay Square]], which generally feature dancing, concerts, laser and light shows as well as the traditional countdown and fireworks display.\n\n===Ukraine===\n[[File:Christmas tree in Kyiv, 2019-2020.jpg|thumb|New Year celebration in [[Kiev]]]]\nIn the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, New Year's has the same cultural significance as Christmas has in the United States, but without the religious connotations. Ukrainian families traditionally install spruce trees at home, the equivalent of a Christmas tree. Families gather to eat a large feast and reflect on the past year. They have a large celebration, make toasts, and make wishes for a happy New Year. Families give presents to their friends as well as informal acquaintances. As Ukrainians are traditionally a closely-knit community, it is seen as a taboo to not give presents to those the family associates with. Children stay up until midnight, waiting for the New Year. During these celebrations, many Ukrainians tune to special New Year shows, which have become a long-standing tradition for Ukrainian TV. And just before midnight the [[President of Ukraine]] gives his New Year's message to the nation, and when the clock strikes 12, the National Anthem [[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]] is played in all TV and radio stations as well as in Independence Square in Kiev and other cities where holiday celebrations are held.\n\nThe first New year dish in Ukraine which associates with the New year for every Ukrainian person is the Olivier salad. It has become the main \u00abcharacter\u00bb of many jokes and anecdotes. There are several versions about where the name Olivier comes from, but most people say that it appeared thanks to the French chef Olivier, who lived in the USSR in the 1960s and was the owner of a French restaurant in Moscow. He was the first one to cook this dish. Nowadays this salad is also called Russian, potato and meat salad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diolli.com/new-year-dishes-in-ukraine/|title=New year dish - Ukrainian food - Diolli.com|date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nNew Year is often considered a \"pre-celebration\" for Greek Catholics and Eastern Orthodox living in Eastern Europe, primarily in Ukraine, since Christmas is celebrated on 7 January.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====England====\n{{Main|New Year's Eve in London}}\n[[File:LondonTrafSQNYE.jpg|thumb|right|Thousands of people gather in [[central London]] for New Year celebrations, including fireworks at the [[London Eye]] at midnight]]\nThe most prominent New Year's Eve (Old Year's Night) celebration in England is that of [[Central London]], where the arrival of midnight is greeted with the chimes of [[Big Ben]]. In recent years, a major fireworks display has also been held, with fireworks launched from the nearby [[London Eye]] Ferris wheel. On New Year's Eve 2010, an estimated 250,000 people gathered to view an eight-minute fireworks display around and above the London Eye which was, for the first time, set to a musical soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12093696 | work=BBC News | title=London Eye fireworks mark new year 2011 | date=1 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/01/uk-welcomes-new-year-fireworks | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Batty | title=New Year's Eve in the UK: 'The best fireworks ever' | date=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nOther major New Year events are held in the cities of [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].\n\n====Scotland====\n{{main|Hogmanay}}\n{{see also|Edinburgh's Hogmanay}}\n[[File:EdinburghNYE.jpg|thumb|[[Hogmanay]] fireworks in [[Edinburgh]].]]\nIn [[Scotland]], New Year's (''[[Hogmanay]]'') is celebrated with several different customs, such as [[First-Foot]]ing, which involves friends or family members going to each other's houses with a gift of whisky and sometimes a lump of coal.\n\n[[Edinburgh]], the Scottish capital, hosts one of the world's most famous New Year celebrations. The celebration is focused on a major street party along [[Princes Street]]. The cannon is fired at [[Edinburgh Castle]] at the stroke of midnight, followed by a large fireworks display. Edinburgh hosts a festival of four or five days, beginning on 28 December, and lasting until New Year's Day or 2 January, which is also a [[bank holiday]] in Scotland.\n\nOther cities across Scotland, such as [[Aberdeen]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Stirling]] have large organised celebrations too, including fireworks at midnight.\n\n[[BBC Scotland]] [[Hogmanay Live|broadcast the celebrations]] in Edinburgh to a Scottish audience, with the celebrations also screened across the world.

The race celebrates the life and achievements of Welsh runner [[Guto Nyth Br\u00e2n]].\n\nFounded in 1958 by local runner Bernard Baldwin, it is run over the 5-kilometre route of Guto's first competitive race. The main race starts with a church service at [[Llanwynno]], and then a wreath is laid on Guto's grave in [[Llanwynno]] graveyard. After lighting a torch, it is carried to the nearby town of Mountain Ash, where the main race takes place.\n\nThe race consists of a double circuit of the town centre, starting in Henry Street and ending in Oxford Street, by the commemorative statue of Guto. Traditionally, the race was timed to end at midnight, but in recent times it was rescheduled for the convenience of family entertainment, now concluding at around 9 pm.\n\nThis has resulted in a growth in size and scale, and the proceedings now start with an afternoon of street entertainment, and fun run races for children, concluding with the church service, elite runners' race, and presentations.\n\n==Middle East==\n===Israel===\nNew Year's Eve (''Sylvester'') in [[Israel]], is celebrated by parties, social get togethers, concerts, and dining out in major cities such as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tel Aviv]].

The dinner features traditional dishes such as tabouli, hummus, kibbi, and other Lebanese foods. These celebrations could also take place in restaurants and clubs. Game shows are also organized where people can try to win money. The countdown to New Year's is broadcast through the leading TV channel and the celebrations usually continue until sunrise. Fireworks are lit throughout the night.\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nAs the [[Islamic calendar]] is the official civic calendar, the [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice]]\u2014Saudi Arabia's [[Islamic religious police|religious police]], has enforced a ban on public festivities of the Gregorian New Year.
