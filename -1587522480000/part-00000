Due to the high costs of producing and acquiring talent for shows outside the typical areas of [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]], plus the significantly low ratings such shows received in [[Miami Beach]], the remaining shows were moved to Los Angeles to regain traction, but never did. Diller eventually sold the TV assets to [[Univision]] after rejecting a bid from [[The Walt Disney Company]]. [[The USA Network]] and its assets were later sold off to [[Vivendi]].

Along with this acquisition, Diller also purchased the rights to the [[USA Network]] from the [[Bronfman]] family. Due to Home Shopping getting more notoriety on the cable networks from his former dealings with the QVC Network, Diller sought to repurpose the broadcast stations into independent, locally run stations as part of a station group dubbed [[USA Broadcasting]] of which the flagship station was [[WAMI-TV]] in [[Miami Beach, Florida]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe purpose of the network was to have the flagship, WAMI, produce sports and news programming while testing locally produced general-interest programming for the other stations in the group. Due to the high costs of producing and acquiring talent for shows outside the typical areas of [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]], plus the significantly low ratings such shows received in [[Miami Beach]], the remaining shows were moved to Los Angeles to regain traction, but never did. Diller eventually sold the TV assets to [[Univision]] after rejecting a bid from [[The Walt Disney Company]]. [[The USA Network]] and its assets were later sold off to [[Vivendi]]. Diller retained the assets of the Home Shopping Network and the subsequent Internet assets he acquired later to bolster the HSN Online stable that later became [[IAC/InterActiveCorp]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n===2000s===\n[[Image:Barry Diller, Web 2.0 Conference 2005.jpg|thumb|150px|Barry Diller at the Web 2.0 Conference 2005]]\nDiller was the Chairman of [[Expedia Group|Expedia]] and the Chairman of [[IAC/InterActiveCorp]], an interactive commerce conglomerate and the parent of companies including [[HomeAdvisor]], [[Match.com]], [[Citysearch]], and [[Connected Ventures]], home of [[Vimeo]] and [[CollegeHumor]]IAC/InterActiveCorp is also the parent company of [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]], [[Urbanspoon|UrbanSpoon]], [[The Daily Beast]], and more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mastersofscale.com/barry-diller-learn-to-unlearn/|title=Barry Diller: Learn to unlearn {{!}} Masters of Scale Podcast|work=WaitWhat|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2005, IAC/InterActiveCorp acquired [[Ask.com]], marking a strategic move into the Internet search category.
