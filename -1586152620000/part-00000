It is part of the [[Ranji Trophy]] Elite Group and has seen scattered success over its many years in the Ranji Trophy circuit. It falls into the South Zone in the [[Duleep Trophy]]. Over its long history in the [[Ranji Trophy]] it has won twice and come runner up three times and has made one appearance in the [[Irani Trophy]].\n\n==Competition history==\nHyderabad was the third team in the history of the Ranji Trophy to win the tournament, when it did so in the 1937/38 tournament, beating defending champions Nawanagar in a nailbiting one wicket victory. However, it wouldn't be until 1943 that it would appear in another final and this time, it was thrashed comprehensively by a strong [[Baroda cricket team|Baroda]]. In 1965 it lost to the [[Mumbai cricket team]] and in doing so, failed to break the famous Mumbai winning streak in the 1960s (Mumbai won every year in the 1960s). Its next taste of success was in 1987, where it beat Delhi through first innings lead. It also appeared in the 2000 final but, once again, was unable to beat Mumbai.\n[[File:Hyd Cricket Ranji Team1937-38.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Members of 1937-38 Ranji trophy winning Hyderabad team]]\nThis made up for one appearance in the [[Irani Trophy]], in which it faced up against a 1987 Rest of India side. The match was drawn and Hyderabad won based on its 27-run first innings lead. This was after it was awarded 16-penalty runs for slow over rate on behalf of the Rest of India team.

It is part of the [[Ranji Trophy]] Elite Group and has seen scattered success over its many years in the Ranji Trophy circuit. It falls into the South Zone in the [[Duleep Trophy]]. Over its long history in the [[Ranji Trophy]] it has won twice and come runner up three times and has made one appearance in the [[Irani Trophy]].\n\n==Competition history==\nHyderabad was the third team in the history of the Ranji Trophy to win the tournament, when it did so in the 1937/38 tournament, beating defending champions Nawanagar in a nailbiting one wicket victory. However, it wouldn't be until 1943 that it would appear in another final and this time, it was thrashed comprehensively by a strong [[Baroda cricket team|Baroda]]. In 1965 it lost to the [[Mumbai cricket team]] and in doing so, failed to break the famous Mumbai winning streak in the 1960s (Mumbai won every year in the 1960s). Its next taste of success was in 1987, where it beat Delhi through first innings lead. It also appeared in the 2000 final but, once again, was unable to beat Mumbai.\n[[File:Hyd Cricket Ranji Team1937-38.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Members of 1937-38 Ranji trophy winning Hyderabad team]]\nThis made up for one appearance in the [[Irani Trophy]], in which it faced up against a 1987 Rest of India side. The match was drawn and Hyderabad won based on its 27-run first innings lead. This was after it was awarded 16-penalty runs for slow over rate on behalf of the Rest of India team.

The order for the invasion was put forward in \"[[F\u00fchrer Directive]] No. 25\", which [[Adolf Hitler]] issued on 27 March 1941, following the [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=55}}\n\nThe invasion commenced with an overwhelming [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|air attack on Belgrade]] and facilities of the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] (VVKJ) by the [[Luftwaffe]] (German Air Force) and attacks by [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German land forces]] from southwestern [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. These attacks were followed by German thrusts from [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] and the [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]. Italian forces were limited to air and artillery attacks until 11 April, when the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian army]] attacked towards [[Ljubljana]] (in modern-day [[Slovenia]]) and through [[Istria]] and [[Lika]] and down the [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian coast]]. On the same day, Hungarian forces entered Yugoslav [[Ba\u010dka]] and [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]], but like the Italians they faced practically no resistance. A Yugoslav attack into the northern parts of the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939\u20131943)|Italian protectorate of Albania]] met with initial success, but was inconsequential due to the collapse of the rest of the Yugoslav forces.\n\nScholars have proposed several theories for the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]'s sudden collapse, including poor training and equipment, generals eager to secure a quick cessation of hostilities, and a sizeable [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalist]] [[fifth column]]. The invasion ended when an [[armistice]] was signed on 17 April 1941, based on the [[unconditional surrender]] of the Yugoslav army, which came into effect at noon on 18 April. Yugoslavia was then [[Military occupation|occupied]] and [[Partition (politics)|partitioned]] by the Axis powers. Some areas of Yugoslavia were [[Annexation|annexed]] by neighboring Axis countries, some areas remained occupied, and in other areas Axis [[puppet state]]s such as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}, or NDH) were created during the invasion on 10 April. Along with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s [[Greco-Italian War|stalled invasion of Greece]] on 28 October 1940, and the German-led [[Battle of Greece|invasion of Greece]] (Operation ''Marita'') and [[Battle of Crete|invasion of Crete]] (Operation ''Merkur''), the invasion of Yugoslavia was part of the German [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Balkanfeldzug}}).\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Greco-Italian War|Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nIn October 1940, [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism|Fascist Italy]] had attacked the [[Kingdom of Greece]] only to be forced back into [[Albanian Kingdom (1939\u20131943)|Albania]]. German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] recognised the need to go to the aid of his ally, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]. Hitler did this not only to restore diminished [[Axis powers|Axis]] prestige, but also to prevent Britain from bombing the Romanian [[Ploie\u0219ti]] oilfields from which [[Nazi Germany]] obtained most of its oil.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|p=64}}\n\nIn 1940 and early 1941, [[Kingdom of Hungary (Regency)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] all agreed to adhere to the [[Tripartite Pact]] and thus join the Axis. Hitler then pressured Yugoslavia to join as well.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=34}} The Regent, [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], yielded to this pressure, and declared [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|Yugoslavia's accession]] to the Pact on 25 March 1941.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=39}} This move was highly unpopular with the [[Serb]]-dominated officer corps of the military and some segments of the public: a large part of the Serbian population, as well as liberals and Communists.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=41}} Military officers (mainly Serbs) executed a coup d'\u00e9tat on 27 March 1941, and forced the Regent to resign, while [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]], though only 17, was declared of age.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=43\u201347}}\n\n==Preparation==\nUpon hearing news of the coup in Yugoslavia, Hitler called his military advisers to Berlin on 27 March. On the same day as the coup he issued [[F\u00fchrer Directives|F\u00fchrer Directive 25]], which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state.{{sfn|Trevor-Roper|1964|p=108}} Hitler took the coup as a personal insult, and was so angered that he was determined, in his words, \"to destroy Yugoslavia militarily and as a state\" (''Jugoslawien milit\u00e4risch und als Staatsgebilde zu zerschlagen''),{{sfn|Dedijer|1956|p=3}} and to do so \"with pitiless harshness\"<ref>International Military Tribunal, The Trial of German Major War Criminals, Judgement: [http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/judgment/j-invasion-yugoslavia.html The Aggression Against Yugoslavia And Greece], p. 32.</ref> and \"without waiting for possible declarations of loyalty of the new government\".{{sfn|Shirer|2002|p=824}}\n\nHungary had joined the Tripartite Pact on 20 November 1940. On 12 December it also concluded a treaty with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia calling for \"permanent peace and eternal friendship\".{{sfn|Klajn|2007|p=104}} The Hungarian leadership was split after Germany's War Directive 25 was delivered on 27 March 1941. Regent [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] and the military favoured taking part in the invasion of Yugoslavia and mobilized the following day. Prime Minister [[P\u00e1l Teleki]] sought to prevent German troops passing through Hungary and cited the peace treaty with Yugoslavia as an impediment to cooperation with the Germans.{{sfn|Klajn|2007|p=105}}\n\nOn 1 April Yugoslavia redesignated its Assault Command as the [[Chetnik Command]], after [[Chetniks in occupied Serbia (1916\u201318)|the Serb guerrilla forces]] from [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|World War I]] which had resisted the [[Central Powers]].

The 19 German [[division (military)|divisions]] included five [[panzer division]]s, two [[motorised infantry]] divisions and two [[Mountain warfare|mountain]] divisions. The German force also included three well-equipped independent motorised infantry regiments and was supported by over 750 aircraft. The Italian [[Second Army (Italy)|2nd Army]] and [[Ninth Army (Italy)|9th Army]] committed a total of 22 divisions and 666 aircraft to the operation.

German troops entered each of these countries under different pretenses and at different times. The first country to receive a German military mission was Romania. Ostensibly to train the Romanian armed forces, its real purpose was to protect Romania's petroleum resources and prepare for an attack on the Soviet Union. The ''Wehrmacht'' entered Bulgaria more circumspectly, first with the intention of providing aerial defense against any force attacking Romania's oilfields and later with that of invading Greece in support of Italy. German troops did not enter Hungary until the attack on Yugoslavia was already planned and Hungary's participation had been secured.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n====Deployment in Romania====\nKing [[Carol II of Romania]], starting from the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] to the Soviet Union, proposed in a letter to Adolf Hitler on 2 July 1940 that Germany send a military mission to Romania.{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=36}} The Romanian government asked that a mission be sent urgently on 7 September 1940, the day after Carol's abdication.{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=79}} The decision to aid Romania was taken on 19 September, and Hungary was asked to provide transit to German soldiers on 30 September.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=440\u201341}} The first troops entered Romania on 10 October.{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=71}} They entered [[Bucharest]] two days later (12 October) to shouts of ''Heil!''{{sfn|Schreiber|2006|pp=408\u201309}} The official explanation for the presence of German troops was that they were there to train the Romanian army. Hitler's directive to the troops on 10 October had stated that \"it is necessary to avoid even the slightest semblance of military occupation of Romania.\"{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=79}} In the second half of October, the Romanian leader, [[Ion Antonescu]], asked that the military mission be expanded. The Germans happily obliged the request, since the [[Petrochemical industry in Romania|oil fields and refineries at Ploie\u0219ti]] were vital to their war effort. Romania was also an important launching point for an attack on the Soviet Union, which made the presence of German troops a violation of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of 23 August 1939.{{sfn|Vogel|2006|pp=452\u201353}}\n\nBy the middle of November the [[13th Motorised Infantry Division]] had been assembled in Romania, and reinforced by the [[4th Panzer Regiment]], engineers and signal troops, as well as six fighter and two reconnaissance ''Luftwaffe'' squadrons, and some antiaircraft artillery.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=10\u201311}} A total of seventy batteries of artillery were moved into Romania.{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=79}} On 23 November, Romania signed the Tripartite Pact. At the time Germany informed Romania that she would not be expected to participate in an attack on Greece, but that Germany wanted to use Romanian territory to provide a base for a German attack. On 24 November, Antonescu met with [[Wilhelm Keitel]], chief of the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'', to discuss common defense. As a result of this meeting, the [[16th Panzer Division]] was sent to Romania in late December. The 12th Army and First Panzer Group, along with heavy bridging equipment for the planned crossing of the Danube, followed in January 1941.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=10\u201311}} By January 1941 the total number of German effectives in Romania was 170,639.{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=79}} Those elements of the 12th Army that were to invade Yugoslavia from Romania assembled near [[Timi\u0219oara]] (Temeschwar).\n\nBetween November 1940 and February 1941 the ''Luftwaffe'' gradually moved 135 fighters and reconnaissance aircraft into Romania (in 22\u201326 squadrons). In early April 1941 they moved a further 600 aircraft from France, Africa, and Sicily into Romania and Bulgaria in a period of ten days. The fighter and reconnaissance craft were sent to fields in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], [[Deva, Romania|Deva]], and [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin|Turnu Severin]].{{sfn|US Army|1986|p=39}} On 12 February Britain broke off diplomatic relations with Romania on the grounds that it was an enemy-occupied country.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=470}}\n\n====Deployment in Bulgaria====\nTwo events in early November 1940 convinced Hitler of the need to station troops, especially the ''Luftwaffe'', in Bulgaria. The first was false reports that the British were constructing an airfield on [[Lemnos]], from which they could bomb [[Ploie\u0219ti]]. The second was the beginning of British air raids originating from Greek bases against Italian shipping on 6 November. Planning for the German invasion of Greece from Bulgaria began on 12 November.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nAlready on 13 November, the Soviets were (incorrectly) accusing the Germans of having troops in neutral Bulgaria. On 18 November, Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria]] met with Hitler and promised to participate in an attack on Greece, but only at the last moment.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=12\u201316}} Shortly thereafter a secret German team under Colonel [[Kurt Zeitzler]] entered Bulgaria to establish fuel depots, arrange for troop billeting and scout the terrain. They were soon followed by hundreds of ''Luftwaffe'' personnel to establish air observation stations. By the end of December over a thousand German troops in civilian clothing were active in Bulgaria, although the latter's government continued to deny it.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=36\u201337}} Bombers and dive-bombers were also gradually moved into Bulgaria, beginning in November. By the end of March 1941, the ''Luftwaffe'' had 355 aircraft in the country.{{sfn|US Army|1986|p=39}}\n\nOn 17 February 1941, Bulgaria signed a [[Bulgarian\u2013Turkish Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Turkey]], paving the way for its adherence to the Tripartite Pact, which was signed by Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]] in Vienna on 1 March.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=44\u201345}} When Ivan V. Petrov, member of the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|National Assembly]] from [[Yablanitsa]], asked why the Assembly had not been consulted, Filov pointed out that the constitution only required parliamentary approval prior to ratification. The signing was ratified by a vote in the Assembly of 140 to 20.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=44\u201345}} The first German troops crossed the Danube from Romania on 28 February, a day before Bulgaria joined the pact.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=171}} The greater part of the 12th Army, augmented by [[8th Air Corps (Germany)|VIII.

They were welcomed by the Russophile population, who believed that Germany and the Soviet Union were allied.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=46}} The 12th Army was originally deployed solely for an attack on Greece. After receiving Directive No. 25, which projected an invasion of Yugoslavia in the direction of Belgrade on 8 April, the force was redeployed in three groups: one along the Turkish border, one along the Greek border and one along the Yugoslav border. Motorized transport was brought in from Romania to achieve this feat in a few days.{{sfn|US Army|1986|p=32}}\n\n====Deployment in Hungary====\n=====German troops=====\nAlthough German troops had been refused the right to transit Hungary for the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, they were permitted to pass through Hungary as civilians on their way to Romania in 1940. In September 1940 the Hungarian legation in Berlin had granted over 6,500 transit visas to Germans traveling to Romania.{{sfn|B\u00e1n|2004|pp=100\u201301}} On 30 September, shortly after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, Ribbentrop and General Keitel asked the Hungarian foreign minister, [[Istv\u00e1n Cs\u00e1ky]], who was in Vienna, to grant the Germans use of transit facilities for German military \"study groups\" to pass through to Romania.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=462\u201364}} They were still awaiting final confirmation on 3 October.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=440\u201341}} The arrangement agreed was that six trains would pass through Hungary at night carrying German soldiers in sealed cars.

Despite some official denials, the troops movements were reported by [[Reuters]] and the American ambassador received a full report.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=462\u201364}} According to contemporary British intelligence, three divisions had passed through Hungary to Romania by 2 November. On 20 November, Hungarian Prime Minister P\u00e1l Teleki signed the Tripartite Pact after a meeting with Hitler in [[Berchtesgarden]]. At the meeting, Hitler spoke of his intention to aid Italy against Greece, thereby preparing the Hungarians for his future demands.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nOn 13 December 1940\u2014the day after the [[Hungaro-Yugoslav Non-Aggression Pact]] and the day Hitler issued [[Operation Marita|F\u00fchrer Directive No. 20]]\u2014major German troop movements began. The Germans had initially promised to supply 180 locomotives for the transfers, but later the Hungarians were complaining that only 130 had arrived. On 24 December, [[Istv\u00e1n Horthy]], President of [[Hungarian State Railways]] (HSR), demanded negotiations before implementing requested German increases, but Ambassador [[Otto von Erdmannsdorf]] informed him that it had all been settled in Vienna by Keitel and Cs\u00e1ky.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=462\u201364}} The German traffic was so large that on 28 December the HSR had to suspend travel on all its trains for several days on account of a shortage of coal. Hungarian officials tried to meet all German demands without going further than the governments had agreed. Even sabotage was used on occasion to prevent having to give the Germans more support than required.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=463 n. 2, citing a group of documents, N.G. 2546, detailing acts of disruption}} On 18 January 1941 an agreement was reached to store German supplies in Hungarian warehouses under Hungarian guard, with only a German officer in Budapest to serve as a liaison. These supplies were to be used in the campaign against Greece.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=462\u201364}}\n\n=====Hungarian troops=====\n[[File:H Werth.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hungarian chief-of-staff Werth was a leading proponent and key planner of Hungary's involvement in the invasion.]]\nOn the day of the ''coup'' in Belgrade, Hitler informed the Hungarian ambassador, [[D\u00f6me Szt\u00f3jay]], that events in Yugoslavia might necessitate intervention and that Hungary's help would in such a case be desired. A Hungarian response was hammered out in council and delivered the following day (28 March). On 30 March, General [[Friedrich Paulus]] arrived in Budapest and met with [[Henrik Werth]], chief of the Hungarian general staff, and Major General [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Dese\u0151]]. The Hungarians proposed they mobilize five divisions for the attack on Yugoslavia. Two were to be held in reserve, while the [[I Corps (Hungary)|First]], [[V Corps (Hungary)|Fifth]] and [[Gyorshadtest|Mobile Corps]] were to conduct the main attack on [[Subotica]] (''Szabadka''), with a secondary operation east of the river [[Tisza]].{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=481}} Because of Romania's request that Hungarian troops not operate in the [[Banat]], Paulus modified the Hungarian plan and kept their troops west of the Tisza. This final plan \"was put down in map form\", according to Paulus' account, and must have been telephoned to Berlin immediately so as to make into Operational Order No. 25, issued by [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] that same day.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=481}}\n\nThis final plan committed one Hungarian corps of three brigades west of the Danube from [[Lake Balaton]] to [[Barcs]], and twelve brigades (nine on the front and three in reserve) for an offensive in [[Ba\u010dka]] (''B\u00e1cska''). The [[Danube Flotilla (Hungary)|Danube Flotilla]] was to cover the flanks, and the air force was to stand by for orders. The \"Carpathian Group\", composed of [[VIII Corps (Hungary)|Eighth Corps]], the 1st Mountain Brigade and the 8th Border Guard (''Chasseur'') Brigade, was mobilized on the Soviet border, with the Mobile Corps held in reserve.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=481\u201382}}\n\nThese arrangements were agreed to by Werth, he later claimed, \"on the basis of the authorization received\" on 28 April\u2014although this was not the government's view of what had been authorized. Werth applied for permission to mobilize on 1 April, since a mobilization order had to be approved by the cabinet and issued by the regent over the signature of the minister of defense. Werth expected the Germans to begin operations, with the use of Hungarian territory and communications, on 12 April and the Hungarians to complete mobilization by 6 April and begin their offensive on the 15th.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=481\u201382}} A meeting of the Supreme Defense Council was convened for 1 April to discuss Werth's request. After a long debate, it approved his mobilization plan, but refused to place Hungarian troops under German command and restricted Hungarian operations to the occupation of territory abandoned by the Yugoslavs. On 2 April Germany responded that the Paulus\u2013Werth agreement was final, and German staff officers began arriving in Budapest that day. That same day the British informed Hungary that she would be treated as an enemy state if Germany made use of her territory or facilities in an attack on Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=487}} On the morning of 3 April, P\u00e1l Teleki committed suicide; the regent immediately cancelled the mobilization order already given except for the Border Guard and the Mobile Corps, which prompted Werth to resign. Horthy then authorized the mobilization of the [[IV Corps (Hungary)|Fourth]] and Fifth Corps and the Mountain Brigade, and Werth withdrew his resignation.{{sfn|Macartney|1957|p=4}} This occurred so late in the day that zero hour for mobilization to begin was given as midnight of 5 April.

The 1st Army Group with the 4th and 7th Armies, composed mainly of Croatian troops, was in Croatia and Slovenia defending the Italian, German (Austrian) and Hungarian frontiers.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=59}}<ref>Geschichte, pp. 317\u2013318</ref>\n\nThe strength of each \"Army\" amounted to little more than a [[corps]], with the Army Groups consisting of the units deployed as follows:\n\n* '''3rd Army Group''''s 3rd Army consisted of four infantry divisions and one cavalry odred; the 3rd Territorial Army with three infantry divisions and one independent motorized artillery regiment; the 5th Army with four infantry divisions, one cavalry division, two odred and one independent motorized artillery regiment and the 6th Army with three infantry divisions, the two Royal Guards brigades (odred) and three infantry odred.\n* '''2nd Army Group''''s 1st Army had one infantry and one cavalry division, three odred and six frontier defence regiments; the 2nd Army had three infantry divisions and one frontier defence regiment.\n* '''1st Army Group''' consisted of the 4th Army, with three infantry divisions and one odred, whilst the 7th Army had two infantry divisions, one cavalry division, three mountain odred, two infantry odred and nine frontier defence regiments.\n* The Strategic, \"'''Supreme Command'''\" Reserve in [[Bosnia]] comprised four infantry divisions, four independent infantry regiments, one tank battalion, two motorized engineer battalions, two motorized heavy artillery regiments, 15 independent artillery battalions and two independent anti-aircraft artillery battalions.\n* '''Coastal Defence Force''', on the [[Adriatic]] opposite [[Zadar]] comprised one infantry division and two odred, in addition to fortress brigades and anti-aircraft units at [[\u0160ibenik]] and [[Kotor]].<ref>Fatutta & Covelli, 1975. p.52.</ref>\n\nOn the eve of invasion, clothing and footwear were available for only two-thirds or so of the potential front-line troops and only partially for other troops; some other essential supplies were available for only a third of the front-line troops; medical and sanitary supplies were available for only a few weeks, and supplies of food for men and feed for livestock were available for only about two months. In all cases there was little or no possibility of replenishment.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=61}}\n\nBeyond the problems of inadequate equipment and incomplete mobilization, the Yugoslav Army suffered badly from the Serbo-Croat schism in Yugoslav politics. \"Yugoslav\" resistance to the invasion collapsed overnight. The main reason was that none of the subordinate national groups, including Slovenes and Croats, were prepared to fight in defence of a Serbian Yugoslavia. Also, so that the Slovenes did not feel abandoned, defences were built on Yugoslavia's northern border when the natural line of defence was much further south, based on the rivers Sava and Drina. The only effective opposition to the invasion was from wholly Serbian units within the borders of Serbia itself.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The Germans, thrusting north-west from [[Skopje]], were held up at Kacanik Pass and lost several tanks (P39, Buckley C \"Greece and Crete 1941\" HMSO 1977).

The Italian part in the ground offensive began when their 2nd Army attacked from northeastern Italy towards [[Ljubljana]] and down the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, meeting virtually no resistance. On the same day, the Hungarian 3rd Army crossed the Yugoslav border and advanced toward [[Novi Sad]], but like the Italians, they met no serious resistance. On 12 April, German troops captured Belgrade,{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=68}} and Ljubljana fell to the Italians.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=69}} On 14 and 15 April, King Peter and the government flew out of the country,{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=71\u201372}} and the Yugoslav Supreme Command was captured by the Germans near [[Sarajevo]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=68\u201369}} The surrender was signed on 17 April, and came into effect at noon on 18 April.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=73}}\n\n===Air operations===\nFollowing the Belgrade Coup on 27 March 1941, the Yugoslav armed forces were put on alert, although the army was not fully mobilised for fear of provoking Hitler. The VVKJ command decided to disperse its forces away from their main bases to a system of 50 auxiliary airfields that had previously been prepared. However, many of these airfields lacked facilities and had inadequate drainage which prevented the continued operation of all but the very lightest aircraft in the adverse weather conditions encountered in April 1941.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=174}}\n\nDespite having, on paper at any rate, a substantially stronger force of relatively modern aircraft than the combined British and Greek air forces to the south, the VVKJ could simply not match the overwhelming ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Regia Aeronautica'' superiority in terms of numbers, tactical deployment and combat experience.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=178}}\n\nThe bomber and maritime force hit targets in Italy, Germany (Austria), Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania and Greece, as well as attacking German, Italian and Hungarian troops. Meanwhile, the fighter squadrons inflicted not insignificant losses on escorted Luftwaffe bomber raids on Belgrade and Serbia, as well as upon ''Regia Aeronautica'' raids on Dalmatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Montenegro. The VVKJ also provided direct air support to the hard pressed Yugoslav Army by strafing attacking troop and mechanized columns in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia (sometimes taking off and strafing the troops attacking the very base being evacuated).{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=178\u2013229}}\n\nAfter a combination of air combat losses, losses on the ground to enemy air attack on bases and the overrunning of airfields by enemy troops, after 11 days the VVKJ almost ceased to exist. However, continued domestic aircraft production during the invasion supplied the VVKJ with an additional eight Hurricane Is, six [[Dornier Do 17]]Ks, four Blenheim Is, two [[Ikarus IK 2]]s, one [[Rogozarski IK-3]] and one Messerschmitt Bf 109 from the local aeronautical industry's aircraft factories and workshops.{{sfn|Savi\u0107|Cigli\u0107|2002|p=8}}\n\nAt the beginning of the April war, the VVKJ was armed with some 60 German designed Do 17Ks, purchased by Yugoslavia in the autumn of 1938, together with a manufacturing licence. The sole operator was ''3 vazduhoplovni puk'' (3rd bomber regiment) composed of two bomber groups; the 63rd Bomber Group stationed at [[Petrovec]] airfield near [[Skopje]] and the 64th Bomber Group stationed at Milesevo airfield near [[Pri\u0161tina]]. Other auxiliary airfields had also been prepared to aid in dispersal.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=179}}\n\nDuring the course of hostilities, the State Aircraft Factory in [[Kraljevo]] managed to produce six more aircraft of this type. Of the final three, two were delivered to the VVKJ on 10 April and one was delivered on 12 April 1941.{{sfn|Savi\u0107|Cigli\u0107|2002|p=8}}\n\nOn 6 April, Luftwaffe dive-bombers and ground-attack fighters destroyed 26 of the Yugoslav Dorniers in the initial assault on their airfields, but the remaining aircraft were able to effectively hit back with numerous attacks on German mechanized columns and upon Bulgarian airfields.{{sfn|Cigli\u0107|Savi\u0107|2007|p=32\u201338}} By the end of the campaign total Yugoslav losses stood at four destroyed in aerial combat and 45 destroyed on the ground.{{sfn|Goss|2005|p=10}}\nOn 14 and 15 April, the seven remaining Do 17K flew to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] airfield in [[Montenegro]] and took part in the evacuation of [[Petar II Karadjordjevic|King Petar II]] and members of the Yugoslav government to Greece. During this operation, Yugoslav gold reserves were also airlifted to Greece by the seven Do 17s,{{sfn|Goss|2005|p=10}} as well as by SM-79Ks and Lockheed Electra's but after completing their mission, five Do 17Ks were destroyed on the ground when Italian aircraft attacked the Greek-held Paramitia airfield. Only two Do 17Ks escaped destruction in Greece and later joined the British Royal Air Force ([[RAF]]) in the [[Kingdom of Egypt]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=260}}\n\nAt 16:00 on 15 April the C-in-C of ''Luftflotte 4'', ''Generaloberst'' [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]] received orders from [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] to wind down the air-offensive and transfer the bulk of the dive-bomber force to support the campaign in Greece.{{sfn|Weal|1998|p=29}}\n\nA total of 18 bomber, transport and maritime patrol aircraft (two Dornier Do 17Ks, four Savoia Marchetti SM-79Ks, three Lockheed Electra's, eight Dornier Do-22Ks and one Rogozarski SIM-XIV-H) succeeded in escaping to the Allied base in [[Egypt]] at the end of the campaign.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=260}}\n\n====Bombing of Belgrade====\n{{Main|Operation Retribution (1941)}}\n\n''Luftflotte 4'' of the Luftwaffe, with a strength of seven Combat Formations (''[[Kampfgruppen]]'') had been committed to the campaign in the Balkans.{{sfn|Goss|2005|p=89}} At 07:00 on 6 April the Luftwaffe opened the assault on Yugoslavia by conducting a saturation-type bombing raid on the capital, \"Operation Retribution\" (''Unternehmen Strafgericht'').{{sfn|Vogel|2006|p=497}} Flying in relays from airfields in Austria and Romania, 300 aircraft, of which a quarter were [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stukas'', protected by a heavy fighter escort began the attack.{{sfn|Weal|1998|p=25}} The dive-bombers were to silence the Yugoslav [[anti-aircraft]] defences while the medium bombers consisting mainly Dornier Do 17s and [[Junkers Ju 88]] attacked the city. The initial raid was carried out at 15-minute intervals in three distinct waves, each lasting for approximately 20 minutes. Thus, the city was subjected to a rain of bombs for almost one and a half hours. The German bombers directed their main effort against the center of the city, where the principal government buildings were located. The medium bomber ''Kampfgruppen'' continued their attack on the city for several days while the Stuka [[dive bomber]] wings (''Stukageschwader'') were soon diverted to Yugoslav airfields.{{sfn|Weal|1998|p=25}}\n\nWhen the attack was over, some 4,000 inhabitants lay dead under the debris. This blow virtually destroyed all means of communication between the Yugoslav high command and the forces in the field, although most of the elements of the general staff managed to escape to one of the suburbs.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=208}}\n\nHaving thus delivered the knockout blow to the Yugoslavian nerve center, the Luftwaffe was able to devote its maximum effort to military targets such as Yugoslav airfields, routes of communication, and troop concentrations, and to the close support of German ground operations.{{sfn|Weal|1998|p=27}}\n\nThe VVKJ put up its Belgrade defence interceptors from the six squadrons of the 32nd and 51st Fighter Groups to attack each wave of bombers, although as the day wore on the four squadrons from the 31st and 52nd Fighter Groups, based in central Serbia, also took part. The [[Messerschmitt 109]]E, Hurricane Is and Rogozarski IK-3 fighters scored at least twenty \"kills\" amongst the attacking bombers and their escorting fighters on 6 April and a further dozen shot down on 7 April. The desperate defence by the VVKJ over Belgrade cost it some 20 fighters shot down and 15 damaged.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=200}}\n\n===Ground operations===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1975-036-23, Jugoslawien, gefangene serbische Offiziere.jpg|thumb|Captured Yugoslavian officers before their deportation to Germany]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1973-035-12, Jugoslawien, zerst\u00f6rter jugosl.

The German ''46th Panzer Corps'' had advanced across the Slavonian plain from Austria to attack Belgrade from the west, whilst the ''41st Panzer Corps'' threatened the city from the north after launching its offensive drive from Romania and Hungary. By 11 April, Yugoslavia was criss-crossed by German armoured columns and the only resistance that remained was a large nucleus of the Yugoslav Army around the capital. On 11 April, a German Officer, [[Fritz Klingenberg]] with 5 men, moved into Belgrade to reconnoitre the city. However, after some scattered combat with Yugoslav troops, they entered the centre of the city, whereupon they bluffed about their size and incoming threats of bombardment.

Here the 3rd Yugoslav Army, in cooperation with the Greek Army, was to launch an offensive against the Italian forces in [[Albania]]. This was in order to secure space to enable the withdrawal of the main Yugoslav Army to the south. This would be via Albanian territory in order to reach Greece and the Allied forces to be based there. The strategy was based on the premise that the Yugoslav Army would, together with the Greek and British Armies, form a new version of the [[Salonika Front]] of World War I.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=57}}\n\nOn 8 April the hard-pressed VVKJ sent a squadron of fourteen [[Breguet 19]] light bombers to the city of [[Florina]] in northern Greece to provide assistance to both the Yugoslav and Greek Armies on the Macedonian front.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=215}} The squadron performed numerous bombing and strafing missions during the course of the campaign.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=228}}\n\nThe 3rd Yugoslav Army of the 3rd Army Group was tasked with conducting offensive operations against the Italian army in northern Albania.

The Kosovska Division crossed the border in the [[Prizren]] area of Kosovo and was advancing through the [[Drin River]] valley. The Vardarska Division gained some local success at [[Debar]], while the rest of the army's units were still assembling.<ref name=\"Fatutta & Covelli, 1975, p. 49\">Fatutta & Covelli, 1975, p. 49.</ref>\n\nThe next day, the 8th, found the Zetska Division steadily advancing along the [[Podgorica]]\u2013[[Shkod\u00ebr]] road. The Komski cavalry Odred successfully crossed the dangerous Prokletije mountains and reached the village of Koljegcava in the Valjbone River Valley. South of them the Kosovska Division broke through the Italian defences in the Drin River Valley, but due to the fall of Skopje to the attacks by the German Army, the Vardarska Division was forced to stop its operations in Albania.<ref name=\"Fatutta & Covelli, 1975, p. 49\"/>\n\nThere was little further progress for the Yugoslavs on 9 April 1941, because although the Zetska Division continued advancing towards Shkod\u00ebr and the Komski Odred reached the Drin River, the Kosovska Division had to halt all combat activities on the Albanian Front due to the appearance of German troops in Prizren.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016230-0009, Bersaglieri in Jugoslawien.jpg|thumb|Italian Bersaglieri during the invasion]]\nOn 10 April 1941 the Zetska Division was still steadily fighting its way towards Shkod\u00ebr and had advanced 50&nbsp;km in some places.

The Yugoslav forces launched their attack on 9 April but by 13 April the Italian forces had counter-attacked and were in Benkovac by 14 April.<ref>Fatutta & Covelli, 1975, p. 51.</ref> The naval prong to this attack faltered when the destroyer ''Beograd'' was damaged by near misses from Italian aircraft off \u0160ibenik when her starboard engine was put out of action, after which she limped to Kotor, escorted by the remainder of the force, for repair.<ref name=\"Whitely, 2001, p. 312\">Whitely, 2001, p. 312.</ref> Italian air raids on Kotor badly damaged the minelayer ''Kobac'', which was beached to prevent sinking.<ref name=\"Enrico Cernuschi pp. 20\">Enrico Cernuschi, ''Le operazioni navali contro la Jugoslavia, 6\u201318 aprile 1941'', on \"Storia Militare\" n. 242, pp. 20 to 39.</ref>\n\nThe maritime patrol float-planes of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force flew reconnaissance and attack missions during the campaign, as well as providing air cover for mine-laying operations off Zara. Their operations included attacks on the Albanian port of [[Durr\u00ebs]], as well as strikes against Italian re-supply convoys to Albania. On 9 April, one [[Dornier Do 22]]K floatplane notably took on an Italian convoy of 12 steamers with an escort of eight destroyers crossing the Adriatic during the day, attacking single-handed in the face of intense AA fire.<ref>Shores, et al., 1987, p. 218.</ref> No Italian ships, however, were sunk by Yugoslav forces;<ref name=\"Enrico Cernuschi pp. 20\"/> an Italian tanker was claimed damaged by a near miss off the Italian coast near [[Bari]].\n\nThe Royal Yugoslav Navy also had at its disposal four large, heavily armed and armoured river [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s in its riverine flotilla. They were used to patrol the Danube, Drava and Sava rivers in the northern parts of Yugoslavia and its border with Hungary. These monitors, ''Drava'', ''Sava'', ''Morava'' and ''Vardar'', had been inherited from the Austrian Navy at the end of World War I. All were of around 400-500t with a main armament of two 120&nbsp;mm guns, two or three 66&nbsp;mm guns, 120&nbsp;mm mortars, 40&nbsp;mm [[AA gun]]s and machine guns. At the start of the campaign they had carried out offensive operations by shelling the airfield at [[Moh\u00e1cs]] in Hungary on 6 April and again two days later, but had to begin withdrawing towards [[Novi Sad]] by 11 April after coming under repeated attack by German dive-bombers.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=223}}\n\nEarly in the morning of 12 April, a squadron of German Ju 87 dive-bombers attacked the Yugoslav monitors on the Danube. ''Drava'', commanded by Aleksandar Beri\u0107,<ref>{{cite book |title=Pomorska enciklopedija, Volume 2 |last=Krle\u017ea |first=Miroslav |author2=Vladislav Brajkovi\u0107 |author3=Petar Marde\u0161i\u0107 |page=240 |year=1972 |publisher=Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod }}</ref> was hit by several of them but they were unable to penetrate ''Drava'''s 300&nbsp;mm thick deck armour, until, by chance, one put a bomb straight down the funnel, killing 54 of the 67-man crew. During the attack anti-aircraft gunners on the monitors claimed three dive-bombers shot down.\nThe remaining three monitors were scuttled by their crews later on 12 April as German and Hungarian forces had occupied the bases and the river systems upon which they operated.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=224}}\n\n===Romanian involvement===\nWhile Romania did not take part in the actual invasion of Yugoslavia, it did provide artillery support for the German forces invading from its territory. Operating on orders from the 3rd Section of the Romanian General Staff, Romanian artillery opened fire against Yugoslav barges on the Danube on 6 April. Romanian and German units from the Romanian bank of the Danube repeatedly exchanged fire with Yugoslav forces between 6 and 11 April. The main Romanian force was at [[Berzasca|Liubcova]], consisting in a battery of 120 mm/L10 naval howitzers in a fortified position. Nearby, there was also a section (2 pieces) of 120 mm/L35 naval howitzers as well as a section of 47 mm light naval guns.<ref>George Cristian Maior, Enciclopedica Pub.

During the twelve days of combat the total casualty figures came to 558 men: 151 were listed as killed, 392 as wounded, and 15 as missing in action. During the XLI Panzer Corps drive on Belgrade, for example, the only officer killed in action fell victim to a civilian sniper's bullet. The Luftwaffe lost approximately 60 aircraft shot down over Yugoslavia, costing the lives of at least 70 aircrew. The Italian Army took heavier casualties in northern Albania from the Yugoslav offensive there (Italian casualties on all fronts during the invasion amounted to some 800 killed and 2,500 wounded<ref>Enrico Cernuschi, ''Le operazioni aeronavali contro la Jugoslavia, 6\u20138 aprile 1941'', in ''Storia Militare'' no. 242, p. 32.</ref>),<ref name=\"Fatutta & Covelli, 1975\"/> whilst the Italian Air Force lost approximately 10 aircraft shot down, with a further 22 damaged. The [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian Army]] suffered some 350 casualties (120 killed, 223 wounded and 13 missing in action) from the shelling by Yugoslav riverine forces of its frontier installations and in its attacks upon the Yugoslav frontier forces in Vojvodina,<ref name=\"Niehorster, 1998, p. 66\"/> with one quarter of a Hungarian parachute 'battalion' becoming casualties when a transport aircraft filled with 30 troops went down during an abortive drop on 12 April.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=222}} The Hungarians also lost five Fiat fighters and one [[Weiss WM-21 S\u00f3lyom]] reconnaissance aircraft during the fighting.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe Germans took between 254,000 and 345,000 Yugoslav prisoners (excluding a considerable number of ethnic Germans and Hungarians who had been conscripted into the Yugoslav Army and who were quickly released after screening) and the Italians took 30,000 more.{{sfn|US Army|1986|p=64}}<ref>Geschichte, p. 325</ref>\n\nApproximately 1,000 army and several hundred VVKJ personnel (including one mobile-workshop unit of six vehicles) escaped via Greece to Egypt.{{sfn|Cigli\u0107|Savi\u0107|2007|p=32}}\n\nIn their brief fight, the VVKJ suffered the loss of 49 aircraft to Axis fighters and anti-aircraft fire, with many more damaged beyond repair. These losses had cost the lives of 27 fighter pilots and 76 bomber aircrew. 85 more aircraft had been destroyed on the ground by air attack, while many others had been destroyed or disabled by their own crews, or had crashed during operations, or in evacuation flights.\n\nDespite these losses, more than 70 Yugoslav aircraft escaped to Allied territory, mostly to Greece, but eight Dornier and Savoia Marchetti bombers set course for the USSR, with four making it safely. Several dozen of the escapee aircraft were destroyed in a devastating strafing attack by the Italian air force on Paramitia airfield in Greece, with nine bombers and transports making it to Egypt. More than 300 operational, auxiliary and training aircraft were captured and passed on to the newly created [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]],{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=310}} Finland, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nAccording to the provisions of the surrender document, the Italians took possession of most of the Yugoslav Navy (one of its four destroyers, the ''Ljubljana'', had spent the campaign in dry-dock).<ref name=\"Whitely, 2001, p. 312\"/> However, in defiance of the said provisions, one destroyer, the ''Zagreb'', was blown up at Kotor by two of its junior officers and one of the British-built submarines and two MTBs succeeded in escaping to Alexandria in Egypt to continue to serve with the Allied cause.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=356}} A fourth destroyer was captured while under construction in the Kotor shipyard, the ''Split'', but the Regia Marina was not able to finish her before the armistice in 1943. Eventually, she was recovered after the war by the Yugoslavs and completed under the original name.<ref>Whitely, 2001, p. 313.</ref> Ten Yugoslav Navy maritime patrol float-planes escaped to Greece, with nine making it to Egypt, where they formed a squadron under RAF command.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=261}}\n\n==Armistice and surrender==\n[[File:Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1941-43.png|thumb|right|Occupation and partition of Yugoslavia 1941]]\n\nThe Axis victory was swift. As early as 14 April the Yugoslav high command had decided to seek an armistice and authorised the army and army group commanders to negotiate local ceasefires. That day the commanders of the 2nd and 5th Armies asked the Germans for terms, but were rejected. Only unconditional surrender could form the basis for negotiations they were told. That evening, the high command sent an emissary to the headquarters of the [[1st Panzer Group]] to ask for armistice, and in response General von Kleist sent the commander of the 2nd Army, von Weichs, to Belgrade to negotiate terms. He arrived on the afternoon of 15 April and drew up an armistice based on unconditional surrender.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nOn 16 April, a Yugoslav delegate arrived in Belgrade, but as he did not have authority to sign the document, he was given a draft of the agreement and an aircraft was placed at his disposal to bring in authorised representatives of the government. Finally, on 17 April, after only eleven days of fighting, the pre-coup Foreign Minister [[Aleksandar Cincar-Markovi\u0107]] and General [[Milojko Jankovi\u0107]] signed the armistice and unconditionally surrendered all Yugoslav troops. It came into effect the following day (18 April) at noon.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=63\u201364}} At the signing, the Hungarians and Bulgarians were represented by liaison officers, but they did not sign the document because their countries were not officially at war with Yugoslavia.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=63\u201364}} The Italian representative, Colonel Luigi Buonofati, signed the document after noting that \"the same terms are valid for the Italian army\".{{sfn|Dedijer|1956|p=9}}\n\nScholars have proposed a number of theories for the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]'s sudden collapse, including poor training and equipment, generals eager to secure a quick cessation of hostilities, and a sizeable Croatian and other non-Serb [[fifth column]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=63\u201368}}{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|pp=383\u2013388}}{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=28}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=204\u2013207}} According to Tomasevich, the insistence of the Yugoslav Army on defending all the borders assured its failure from the start. After the surrender, Yugoslavia was subsequently divided amongst Germany, Hungary, Italy and Bulgaria, with most of Serbia being occupied by Germany. The Italian-backed Croatian fascist leader [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] declared an [[Independent State of Croatia]] before the invasion was even over.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=52\u201353}} Many Serbian nationalists blamed the loss on \"fifth columnist\" Croats who stood to gain from Italian and German rule, ignoring the primary failure of the Yugoslav Army and its almost entirely Serbian leadership.<ref name=\"DoniaFine1994\">{{cite book|author1=Robert J.

[[Axis powers]] which began on 6 April 1941 during [[World War II]]. The order for the invasion was put forward in \"[[F\u00fchrer Directive]] No. 25\", which [[Adolf Hitler]] issued on 27 March 1941, following the [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=55}}\n\nThe invasion commenced with an overwhelming [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|air attack on Belgrade]] and facilities of the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] (VVKJ) by the [[Luftwaffe]] (German Air Force) and attacks by [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German land forces]] from southwestern [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. These attacks were followed by German thrusts from [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] and the [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]. Italian forces were limited to air and artillery attacks until 11 April, when the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian army]] attacked towards [[Ljubljana]] (in modern-day [[Slovenia]]) and through [[Istria]] and [[Lika]] and down the [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian coast]]. On the same day, Hungarian forces entered Yugoslav [[Ba\u010dka]] and [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]], but like the Italians they faced practically no resistance. A Yugoslav attack into the northern parts of the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939\u20131943)|Italian protectorate of Albania]] met with initial success, but was inconsequential due to the collapse of the rest of the Yugoslav forces.\n\nScholars have proposed several theories for the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]'s sudden collapse, including poor training and equipment, generals eager to secure a quick cessation of hostilities, and a sizeable [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalist]] [[fifth column]]. The invasion ended when an [[armistice]] was signed on 17 April 1941, based on the [[unconditional surrender]] of the Yugoslav army, which came into effect at noon on 18 April. Yugoslavia was then [[Military occupation|occupied]] and [[Partition (politics)|partitioned]] by the Axis powers. Some areas of Yugoslavia were [[Annexation|annexed]] by neighboring Axis countries, some areas remained occupied, and in other areas Axis [[puppet state]]s such as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}, or NDH) were created during the invasion on 10 April. Along with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s [[Greco-Italian War|stalled invasion of Greece]] on 28 October 1940, and the German-led [[Battle of Greece|invasion of Greece]] (Operation ''Marita'') and [[Battle of Crete|invasion of Crete]] (Operation ''Merkur''), the invasion of Yugoslavia was part of the German [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Balkanfeldzug}}).\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Greco-Italian War|Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nIn October 1940, [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism|Fascist Italy]] had attacked the [[Kingdom of Greece]] only to be forced back into [[Albanian Kingdom (1939\u20131943)|Albania]]. German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] recognised the need to go to the aid of his ally, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]. Hitler did this not only to restore diminished [[Axis powers|Axis]] prestige, but also to prevent Britain from bombing the Romanian [[Ploie\u0219ti]] oilfields from which [[Nazi Germany]] obtained most of its oil.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|p=64}}\n\nIn 1940 and early 1941, [[Kingdom of Hungary (Regency)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] all agreed to adhere to the [[Tripartite Pact]] and thus join the Axis. Hitler then pressured Yugoslavia to join as well.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=34}} The Regent, [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], yielded to this pressure, and declared [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|Yugoslavia's accession]] to the Pact on 25 March 1941.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=39}} This move was highly unpopular with the [[Serb]]-dominated officer corps of the military and some segments of the public: a large part of the Serbian population, as well as liberals and Communists.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=41}} Military officers (mainly Serbs) executed a coup d'\u00e9tat on 27 March 1941, and forced the Regent to resign, while [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]], though only 17, was declared of age.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=43\u201347}}\n\n==Preparation==\nUpon hearing news of the coup in Yugoslavia, Hitler called his military advisers to Berlin on 27 March. On the same day as the coup he issued [[F\u00fchrer Directives|F\u00fchrer Directive 25]], which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state.{{sfn|Trevor-Roper|1964|p=108}} Hitler took the coup as a personal insult, and was so angered that he was determined, in his words, \"to destroy Yugoslavia militarily and as a state\" (''Jugoslawien milit\u00e4risch und als Staatsgebilde zu zerschlagen''),{{sfn|Dedijer|1956|p=3}} and to do so \"with pitiless harshness\"<ref>International Military Tribunal, The Trial of German Major War Criminals, Judgement: [http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/judgment/j-invasion-yugoslavia.html The Aggression Against Yugoslavia And Greece], p. 32.</ref> and \"without waiting for possible declarations of loyalty of the new government\".{{sfn|Shirer|2002|p=824}}\n\nHungary had joined the Tripartite Pact on 20 November 1940. On 12 December it also concluded a treaty with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia calling for \"permanent peace and eternal friendship\".{{sfn|Klajn|2007|p=104}} The Hungarian leadership was split after Germany's War Directive 25 was delivered on 27 March 1941. Regent [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] and the military favoured taking part in the invasion of Yugoslavia and mobilized the following day. Prime Minister [[P\u00e1l Teleki]] sought to prevent German troops passing through Hungary and cited the peace treaty with Yugoslavia as an impediment to cooperation with the Germans.{{sfn|Klajn|2007|p=105}}\n\nOn 1 April Yugoslavia redesignated its Assault Command as the [[Chetnik Command]], after [[Chetniks in occupied Serbia (1916\u201318)|the Serb guerrilla forces]] from [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|World War I]] which had resisted the [[Central Powers]].

The 19 German [[division (military)|divisions]] included five [[panzer division]]s, two [[motorised infantry]] divisions and two [[Mountain warfare|mountain]] divisions. The German force also included three well-equipped independent motorised infantry regiments and was supported by over 750 aircraft. The Italian [[Second Army (Italy)|2nd Army]] and [[Ninth Army (Italy)|9th Army]] committed a total of 22 divisions and 666 aircraft to the operation.

German troops entered each of these countries under different pretenses and at different times. The first country to receive a German military mission was Romania. Ostensibly to train the Romanian armed forces, its real purpose was to protect Romania's petroleum resources and prepare for an attack on the Soviet Union. The ''Wehrmacht'' entered Bulgaria more circumspectly, first with the intention of providing aerial defense against any force attacking Romania's oilfields and later with that of invading Greece in support of Italy. German troops did not enter Hungary until the attack on Yugoslavia was already planned and Hungary's participation had been secured.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n====Deployment in Romania====\nKing [[Carol II of Romania]], starting from the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] to the Soviet Union, proposed in a letter to Adolf Hitler on 2 July 1940 that Germany send a military mission to Romania.{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=36}} The Romanian government asked that a mission be sent urgently on 7 September 1940, the day after Carol's abdication.{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=79}} The decision to aid Romania was taken on 19 September, and Hungary was asked to provide transit to German soldiers on 30 September.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=440\u201341}} The first troops entered Romania on 10 October.{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=71}} They entered [[Bucharest]] two days later (12 October) to shouts of ''Heil!''{{sfn|Schreiber|2006|pp=408\u201309}} The official explanation for the presence of German troops was that they were there to train the Romanian army. Hitler's directive to the troops on 10 October had stated that \"it is necessary to avoid even the slightest semblance of military occupation of Romania.\"{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=79}} In the second half of October, the Romanian leader, [[Ion Antonescu]], asked that the military mission be expanded. The Germans happily obliged the request, since the [[Petrochemical industry in Romania|oil fields and refineries at Ploie\u0219ti]] were vital to their war effort. Romania was also an important launching point for an attack on the Soviet Union, which made the presence of German troops a violation of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of 23 August 1939.{{sfn|Vogel|2006|pp=452\u201353}}\n\nBy the middle of November the [[13th Motorised Infantry Division]] had been assembled in Romania, and reinforced by the [[4th Panzer Regiment]], engineers and signal troops, as well as six fighter and two reconnaissance ''Luftwaffe'' squadrons, and some antiaircraft artillery.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=10\u201311}} A total of seventy batteries of artillery were moved into Romania.{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=79}} On 23 November, Romania signed the Tripartite Pact. At the time Germany informed Romania that she would not be expected to participate in an attack on Greece, but that Germany wanted to use Romanian territory to provide a base for a German attack. On 24 November, Antonescu met with [[Wilhelm Keitel]], chief of the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'', to discuss common defense. As a result of this meeting, the [[16th Panzer Division]] was sent to Romania in late December. The 12th Army and First Panzer Group, along with heavy bridging equipment for the planned crossing of the Danube, followed in January 1941.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=10\u201311}} By January 1941 the total number of German effectives in Romania was 170,639.{{sfn|Giurescu|2000|p=79}} Those elements of the 12th Army that were to invade Yugoslavia from Romania assembled near [[Timi\u0219oara]] (Temeschwar).\n\nBetween November 1940 and February 1941 the ''Luftwaffe'' gradually moved 135 fighters and reconnaissance aircraft into Romania (in 22\u201326 squadrons). In early April 1941 they moved a further 600 aircraft from France, Africa, and Sicily into Romania and Bulgaria in a period of ten days. The fighter and reconnaissance craft were sent to fields in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], [[Deva, Romania|Deva]], and [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin|Turnu Severin]].{{sfn|US Army|1986|p=39}} On 12 February Britain broke off diplomatic relations with Romania on the grounds that it was an enemy-occupied country.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=470}}\n\n====Deployment in Bulgaria====\nTwo events in early November 1940 convinced Hitler of the need to station troops, especially the ''Luftwaffe'', in Bulgaria. The first was false reports that the British were constructing an airfield on [[Lemnos]], from which they could bomb [[Ploie\u0219ti]]. The second was the beginning of British air raids originating from Greek bases against Italian shipping on 6 November. Planning for the German invasion of Greece from Bulgaria began on 12 November.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nAlready on 13 November, the Soviets were (incorrectly) accusing the Germans of having troops in neutral Bulgaria. On 18 November, Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria]] met with Hitler and promised to participate in an attack on Greece, but only at the last moment.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=12\u201316}} Shortly thereafter a secret German team under Colonel [[Kurt Zeitzler]] entered Bulgaria to establish fuel depots, arrange for troop billeting and scout the terrain. They were soon followed by hundreds of ''Luftwaffe'' personnel to establish air observation stations. By the end of December over a thousand German troops in civilian clothing were active in Bulgaria, although the latter's government continued to deny it.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=36\u201337}} Bombers and dive-bombers were also gradually moved into Bulgaria, beginning in November. By the end of March 1941, the ''Luftwaffe'' had 355 aircraft in the country.{{sfn|US Army|1986|p=39}}\n\nOn 17 February 1941, Bulgaria signed a [[Bulgarian\u2013Turkish Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Turkey]], paving the way for its adherence to the Tripartite Pact, which was signed by Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]] in Vienna on 1 March.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=44\u201345}} When Ivan V. Petrov, member of the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|National Assembly]] from [[Yablanitsa]], asked why the Assembly had not been consulted, Filov pointed out that the constitution only required parliamentary approval prior to ratification. The signing was ratified by a vote in the Assembly of 140 to 20.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=44\u201345}} The first German troops crossed the Danube from Romania on 28 February, a day before Bulgaria joined the pact.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=171}} The greater part of the 12th Army, augmented by [[8th Air Corps (Germany)|VIII.

They were welcomed by the Russophile population, who believed that Germany and the Soviet Union were allied.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=46}} The 12th Army was originally deployed solely for an attack on Greece. After receiving Directive No. 25, which projected an invasion of Yugoslavia in the direction of Belgrade on 8 April, the force was redeployed in three groups: one along the Turkish border, one along the Greek border and one along the Yugoslav border. Motorized transport was brought in from Romania to achieve this feat in a few days.{{sfn|US Army|1986|p=32}}\n\n====Deployment in Hungary====\n=====German troops=====\nAlthough German troops had been refused the right to transit Hungary for the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, they were permitted to pass through Hungary as civilians on their way to Romania in 1940. In September 1940 the Hungarian legation in Berlin had granted over 6,500 transit visas to Germans traveling to Romania.{{sfn|B\u00e1n|2004|pp=100\u201301}} On 30 September, shortly after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, Ribbentrop and General Keitel asked the Hungarian foreign minister, [[Istv\u00e1n Cs\u00e1ky]], who was in Vienna, to grant the Germans use of transit facilities for German military \"study groups\" to pass through to Romania.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=462\u201364}} They were still awaiting final confirmation on 3 October.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=440\u201341}} The arrangement agreed was that six trains would pass through Hungary at night carrying German soldiers in sealed cars.

Despite some official denials, the troops movements were reported by [[Reuters]] and the American ambassador received a full report.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=462\u201364}} According to contemporary British intelligence, three divisions had passed through Hungary to Romania by 2 November. On 20 November, Hungarian Prime Minister P\u00e1l Teleki signed the Tripartite Pact after a meeting with Hitler in [[Berchtesgarden]]. At the meeting, Hitler spoke of his intention to aid Italy against Greece, thereby preparing the Hungarians for his future demands.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nOn 13 December 1940\u2014the day after the [[Hungaro-Yugoslav Non-Aggression Pact]] and the day Hitler issued [[Operation Marita|F\u00fchrer Directive No. 20]]\u2014major German troop movements began. The Germans had initially promised to supply 180 locomotives for the transfers, but later the Hungarians were complaining that only 130 had arrived. On 24 December, [[Istv\u00e1n Horthy]], President of [[Hungarian State Railways]] (HSR), demanded negotiations before implementing requested German increases, but Ambassador [[Otto von Erdmannsdorf]] informed him that it had all been settled in Vienna by Keitel and Cs\u00e1ky.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=462\u201364}} The German traffic was so large that on 28 December the HSR had to suspend travel on all its trains for several days on account of a shortage of coal. Hungarian officials tried to meet all German demands without going further than the governments had agreed. Even sabotage was used on occasion to prevent having to give the Germans more support than required.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=463 n. 2, citing a group of documents, N.G. 2546, detailing acts of disruption}} On 18 January 1941 an agreement was reached to store German supplies in Hungarian warehouses under Hungarian guard, with only a German officer in Budapest to serve as a liaison. These supplies were to be used in the campaign against Greece.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=462\u201364}}\n\n=====Hungarian troops=====\n[[File:H Werth.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hungarian chief-of-staff Werth was a leading proponent and key planner of Hungary's involvement in the invasion.]]\nOn the day of the ''coup'' in Belgrade, Hitler informed the Hungarian ambassador, [[D\u00f6me Szt\u00f3jay]], that events in Yugoslavia might necessitate intervention and that Hungary's help would in such a case be desired. A Hungarian response was hammered out in council and delivered the following day (28 March). On 30 March, General [[Friedrich Paulus]] arrived in Budapest and met with [[Henrik Werth]], chief of the Hungarian general staff, and Major General [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Dese\u0151]]. The Hungarians proposed they mobilize five divisions for the attack on Yugoslavia. Two were to be held in reserve, while the [[I Corps (Hungary)|First]], [[V Corps (Hungary)|Fifth]] and [[Gyorshadtest|Mobile Corps]] were to conduct the main attack on [[Subotica]] (''Szabadka''), with a secondary operation east of the river [[Tisza]].{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=481}} Because of Romania's request that Hungarian troops not operate in the [[Banat]], Paulus modified the Hungarian plan and kept their troops west of the Tisza. This final plan \"was put down in map form\", according to Paulus' account, and must have been telephoned to Berlin immediately so as to make into Operational Order No. 25, issued by [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] that same day.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=481}}\n\nThis final plan committed one Hungarian corps of three brigades west of the Danube from [[Lake Balaton]] to [[Barcs]], and twelve brigades (nine on the front and three in reserve) for an offensive in [[Ba\u010dka]] (''B\u00e1cska''). The [[Danube Flotilla (Hungary)|Danube Flotilla]] was to cover the flanks, and the air force was to stand by for orders. The \"Carpathian Group\", composed of [[VIII Corps (Hungary)|Eighth Corps]], the 1st Mountain Brigade and the 8th Border Guard (''Chasseur'') Brigade, was mobilized on the Soviet border, with the Mobile Corps held in reserve.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=481\u201382}}\n\nThese arrangements were agreed to by Werth, he later claimed, \"on the basis of the authorization received\" on 28 April\u2014although this was not the government's view of what had been authorized. Werth applied for permission to mobilize on 1 April, since a mobilization order had to be approved by the cabinet and issued by the regent over the signature of the minister of defense. Werth expected the Germans to begin operations, with the use of Hungarian territory and communications, on 12 April and the Hungarians to complete mobilization by 6 April and begin their offensive on the 15th.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=481\u201382}} A meeting of the Supreme Defense Council was convened for 1 April to discuss Werth's request. After a long debate, it approved his mobilization plan, but refused to place Hungarian troops under German command and restricted Hungarian operations to the occupation of territory abandoned by the Yugoslavs. On 2 April Germany responded that the Paulus\u2013Werth agreement was final, and German staff officers began arriving in Budapest that day. That same day the British informed Hungary that she would be treated as an enemy state if Germany made use of her territory or facilities in an attack on Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=487}} On the morning of 3 April, P\u00e1l Teleki committed suicide; the regent immediately cancelled the mobilization order already given except for the Border Guard and the Mobile Corps, which prompted Werth to resign. Horthy then authorized the mobilization of the [[IV Corps (Hungary)|Fourth]] and Fifth Corps and the Mountain Brigade, and Werth withdrew his resignation.{{sfn|Macartney|1957|p=4}} This occurred so late in the day that zero hour for mobilization to begin was given as midnight of 5 April.

The 1st Army Group with the 4th and 7th Armies, composed mainly of Croatian troops, was in Croatia and Slovenia defending the Italian, German (Austrian) and Hungarian frontiers.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=59}}<ref>Geschichte, pp. 317\u2013318</ref>\n\nThe strength of each \"Army\" amounted to little more than a [[corps]], with the Army Groups consisting of the units deployed as follows:\n\n* '''3rd Army Group''''s 3rd Army consisted of four infantry divisions and one cavalry odred; the 3rd Territorial Army with three infantry divisions and one independent motorized artillery regiment; the 5th Army with four infantry divisions, one cavalry division, two odred and one independent motorized artillery regiment and the 6th Army with three infantry divisions, the two Royal Guards brigades (odred) and three infantry odred.\n* '''2nd Army Group''''s 1st Army had one infantry and one cavalry division, three odred and six frontier defence regiments; the 2nd Army had three infantry divisions and one frontier defence regiment.\n* '''1st Army Group''' consisted of the 4th Army, with three infantry divisions and one odred, whilst the 7th Army had two infantry divisions, one cavalry division, three mountain odred, two infantry odred and nine frontier defence regiments.\n* The Strategic, \"'''Supreme Command'''\" Reserve in [[Bosnia]] comprised four infantry divisions, four independent infantry regiments, one tank battalion, two motorized engineer battalions, two motorized heavy artillery regiments, 15 independent artillery battalions and two independent anti-aircraft artillery battalions.\n* '''Coastal Defence Force''', on the [[Adriatic]] opposite [[Zadar]] comprised one infantry division and two odred, in addition to fortress brigades and anti-aircraft units at [[\u0160ibenik]] and [[Kotor]].<ref>Fatutta & Covelli, 1975. p.52.</ref>\n\nOn the eve of invasion, clothing and footwear were available for only two-thirds or so of the potential front-line troops and only partially for other troops; some other essential supplies were available for only a third of the front-line troops; medical and sanitary supplies were available for only a few weeks, and supplies of food for men and feed for livestock were available for only about two months. In all cases there was little or no possibility of replenishment.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=61}}\n\nBeyond the problems of inadequate equipment and incomplete mobilization, the Yugoslav Army suffered badly from the Serbo-Croat schism in Yugoslav politics. \"Yugoslav\" resistance to the invasion collapsed overnight. The main reason was that none of the subordinate national groups, including Slovenes and Croats, were prepared to fight in defence of a Serbian Yugoslavia. Also, so that the Slovenes did not feel abandoned, defences were built on Yugoslavia's northern border when the natural line of defence was much further south, based on the rivers Sava and Drina. The only effective opposition to the invasion was from wholly Serbian units within the borders of Serbia itself.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The Germans, thrusting north-west from [[Skopje]], were held up at Kacanik Pass and lost several tanks (P39, Buckley C \"Greece and Crete 1941\" HMSO 1977).

The Italian part in the ground offensive began when their 2nd Army attacked from northeastern Italy towards [[Ljubljana]] and down the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, meeting virtually no resistance. On the same day, the Hungarian 3rd Army crossed the Yugoslav border and advanced toward [[Novi Sad]], but like the Italians, they met no serious resistance. On 12 April, German troops captured Belgrade,{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=68}} and Ljubljana fell to the Italians.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=69}} On 14 and 15 April, King Peter and the government flew out of the country,{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=71\u201372}} and the Yugoslav Supreme Command was captured by the Germans near [[Sarajevo]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=68\u201369}} The surrender was signed on 17 April, and came into effect at noon on 18 April.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=73}}\n\n===Air operations===\nFollowing the Belgrade Coup on 27 March 1941, the Yugoslav armed forces were put on alert, although the army was not fully mobilised for fear of provoking Hitler. The VVKJ command decided to disperse its forces away from their main bases to a system of 50 auxiliary airfields that had previously been prepared. However, many of these airfields lacked facilities and had inadequate drainage which prevented the continued operation of all but the very lightest aircraft in the adverse weather conditions encountered in April 1941.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=174}}\n\nDespite having, on paper at any rate, a substantially stronger force of relatively modern aircraft than the combined British and Greek air forces to the south, the VVKJ could simply not match the overwhelming ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Regia Aeronautica'' superiority in terms of numbers, tactical deployment and combat experience.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=178}}\n\nThe bomber and maritime force hit targets in Italy, Germany (Austria), Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania and Greece, as well as attacking German, Italian and Hungarian troops. Meanwhile, the fighter squadrons inflicted not insignificant losses on escorted Luftwaffe bomber raids on Belgrade and Serbia, as well as upon ''Regia Aeronautica'' raids on Dalmatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Montenegro. The VVKJ also provided direct air support to the hard pressed Yugoslav Army by strafing attacking troop and mechanized columns in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia (sometimes taking off and strafing the troops attacking the very base being evacuated).{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=178\u2013229}}\n\nAfter a combination of air combat losses, losses on the ground to enemy air attack on bases and the overrunning of airfields by enemy troops, after 11 days the VVKJ almost ceased to exist. However, continued domestic aircraft production during the invasion supplied the VVKJ with an additional eight Hurricane Is, six [[Dornier Do 17]]Ks, four Blenheim Is, two [[Ikarus IK 2]]s, one [[Rogozarski IK-3]] and one Messerschmitt Bf 109 from the local aeronautical industry's aircraft factories and workshops.{{sfn|Savi\u0107|Cigli\u0107|2002|p=8}}\n\nAt the beginning of the April war, the VVKJ was armed with some 60 German designed Do 17Ks, purchased by Yugoslavia in the autumn of 1938, together with a manufacturing licence. The sole operator was ''3 vazduhoplovni puk'' (3rd bomber regiment) composed of two bomber groups; the 63rd Bomber Group stationed at [[Petrovec]] airfield near [[Skopje]] and the 64th Bomber Group stationed at Milesevo airfield near [[Pri\u0161tina]]. Other auxiliary airfields had also been prepared to aid in dispersal.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=179}}\n\nDuring the course of hostilities, the State Aircraft Factory in [[Kraljevo]] managed to produce six more aircraft of this type. Of the final three, two were delivered to the VVKJ on 10 April and one was delivered on 12 April 1941.{{sfn|Savi\u0107|Cigli\u0107|2002|p=8}}\n\nOn 6 April, Luftwaffe dive-bombers and ground-attack fighters destroyed 26 of the Yugoslav Dorniers in the initial assault on their airfields, but the remaining aircraft were able to effectively hit back with numerous attacks on German mechanized columns and upon Bulgarian airfields.{{sfn|Cigli\u0107|Savi\u0107|2007|p=32\u201338}} By the end of the campaign total Yugoslav losses stood at four destroyed in aerial combat and 45 destroyed on the ground.{{sfn|Goss|2005|p=10}}\nOn 14 and 15 April, the seven remaining Do 17K flew to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] airfield in [[Montenegro]] and took part in the evacuation of [[Petar II Karadjordjevic|King Petar II]] and members of the Yugoslav government to Greece. During this operation, Yugoslav gold reserves were also airlifted to Greece by the seven Do 17s,{{sfn|Goss|2005|p=10}} as well as by SM-79Ks and Lockheed Electra's but after completing their mission, five Do 17Ks were destroyed on the ground when Italian aircraft attacked the Greek-held Paramitia airfield. Only two Do 17Ks escaped destruction in Greece and later joined the British Royal Air Force ([[RAF]]) in the [[Kingdom of Egypt]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=260}}\n\nAt 16:00 on 15 April the C-in-C of ''Luftflotte 4'', ''Generaloberst'' [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]] received orders from [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] to wind down the air-offensive and transfer the bulk of the dive-bomber force to support the campaign in Greece.{{sfn|Weal|1998|p=29}}\n\nA total of 18 bomber, transport and maritime patrol aircraft (two Dornier Do 17Ks, four Savoia Marchetti SM-79Ks, three Lockheed Electra's, eight Dornier Do-22Ks and one Rogozarski SIM-XIV-H) succeeded in escaping to the Allied base in [[Egypt]] at the end of the campaign.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=260}}\n\n====Bombing of Belgrade====\n{{Main|Operation Retribution (1941)}}\n\n''Luftflotte 4'' of the Luftwaffe, with a strength of seven Combat Formations (''[[Kampfgruppen]]'') had been committed to the campaign in the Balkans.{{sfn|Goss|2005|p=89}} At 07:00 on 6 April the Luftwaffe opened the assault on Yugoslavia by conducting a saturation-type bombing raid on the capital, \"Operation Retribution\" (''Unternehmen Strafgericht'').{{sfn|Vogel|2006|p=497}} Flying in relays from airfields in Austria and Romania, 300 aircraft, of which a quarter were [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stukas'', protected by a heavy fighter escort began the attack.{{sfn|Weal|1998|p=25}} The dive-bombers were to silence the Yugoslav [[anti-aircraft]] defences while the medium bombers consisting mainly Dornier Do 17s and [[Junkers Ju 88]] attacked the city. The initial raid was carried out at 15-minute intervals in three distinct waves, each lasting for approximately 20 minutes. Thus, the city was subjected to a rain of bombs for almost one and a half hours. The German bombers directed their main effort against the center of the city, where the principal government buildings were located. The medium bomber ''Kampfgruppen'' continued their attack on the city for several days while the Stuka [[dive bomber]] wings (''Stukageschwader'') were soon diverted to Yugoslav airfields.{{sfn|Weal|1998|p=25}}\n\nWhen the attack was over, some 4,000 inhabitants lay dead under the debris. This blow virtually destroyed all means of communication between the Yugoslav high command and the forces in the field, although most of the elements of the general staff managed to escape to one of the suburbs.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=208}}\n\nHaving thus delivered the knockout blow to the Yugoslavian nerve center, the Luftwaffe was able to devote its maximum effort to military targets such as Yugoslav airfields, routes of communication, and troop concentrations, and to the close support of German ground operations.{{sfn|Weal|1998|p=27}}\n\nThe VVKJ put up its Belgrade defence interceptors from the six squadrons of the 32nd and 51st Fighter Groups to attack each wave of bombers, although as the day wore on the four squadrons from the 31st and 52nd Fighter Groups, based in central Serbia, also took part. The [[Messerschmitt 109]]E, Hurricane Is and Rogozarski IK-3 fighters scored at least twenty \"kills\" amongst the attacking bombers and their escorting fighters on 6 April and a further dozen shot down on 7 April. The desperate defence by the VVKJ over Belgrade cost it some 20 fighters shot down and 15 damaged.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=200}}\n\n===Ground operations===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1975-036-23, Jugoslawien, gefangene serbische Offiziere.jpg|thumb|Captured Yugoslavian officers before their deportation to Germany]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1973-035-12, Jugoslawien, zerst\u00f6rter jugosl.

The German ''46th Panzer Corps'' had advanced across the Slavonian plain from Austria to attack Belgrade from the west, whilst the ''41st Panzer Corps'' threatened the city from the north after launching its offensive drive from Romania and Hungary. By 11 April, Yugoslavia was criss-crossed by German armoured columns and the only resistance that remained was a large nucleus of the Yugoslav Army around the capital. On 11 April, a German Officer, [[Fritz Klingenberg]] with 5 men, moved into Belgrade to reconnoitre the city. However, after some scattered combat with Yugoslav troops, they entered the centre of the city, whereupon they bluffed about their size and incoming threats of bombardment.

Here the 3rd Yugoslav Army, in cooperation with the Greek Army, was to launch an offensive against the Italian forces in [[Albania]]. This was in order to secure space to enable the withdrawal of the main Yugoslav Army to the south. This would be via Albanian territory in order to reach Greece and the Allied forces to be based there. The strategy was based on the premise that the Yugoslav Army would, together with the Greek and British Armies, form a new version of the [[Salonika Front]] of World War I.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=57}}\n\nOn 8 April the hard-pressed VVKJ sent a squadron of fourteen [[Breguet 19]] light bombers to the city of [[Florina]] in northern Greece to provide assistance to both the Yugoslav and Greek Armies on the Macedonian front.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=215}} The squadron performed numerous bombing and strafing missions during the course of the campaign.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=228}}\n\nThe 3rd Yugoslav Army of the 3rd Army Group was tasked with conducting offensive operations against the Italian army in northern Albania.

The Kosovska Division crossed the border in the [[Prizren]] area of Kosovo and was advancing through the [[Drin River]] valley. The Vardarska Division gained some local success at [[Debar]], while the rest of the army's units were still assembling.<ref name=\"Fatutta & Covelli, 1975, p. 49\">Fatutta & Covelli, 1975, p. 49.</ref>\n\nThe next day, the 8th, found the Zetska Division steadily advancing along the [[Podgorica]]\u2013[[Shkod\u00ebr]] road. The Komski cavalry Odred successfully crossed the dangerous Prokletije mountains and reached the village of Koljegcava in the Valjbone River Valley. South of them the Kosovska Division broke through the Italian defences in the Drin River Valley, but due to the fall of Skopje to the attacks by the German Army, the Vardarska Division was forced to stop its operations in Albania.<ref name=\"Fatutta & Covelli, 1975, p. 49\"/>\n\nThere was little further progress for the Yugoslavs on 9 April 1941, because although the Zetska Division continued advancing towards Shkod\u00ebr and the Komski Odred reached the Drin River, the Kosovska Division had to halt all combat activities on the Albanian Front due to the appearance of German troops in Prizren.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016230-0009, Bersaglieri in Jugoslawien.jpg|thumb|Italian Bersaglieri during the invasion]]\nOn 10 April 1941 the Zetska Division was still steadily fighting its way towards Shkod\u00ebr and had advanced 50&nbsp;km in some places.

The Yugoslav forces launched their attack on 9 April but by 13 April the Italian forces had counter-attacked and were in Benkovac by 14 April.<ref>Fatutta & Covelli, 1975, p. 51.</ref> The naval prong to this attack faltered when the destroyer ''Beograd'' was damaged by near misses from Italian aircraft off \u0160ibenik when her starboard engine was put out of action, after which she limped to Kotor, escorted by the remainder of the force, for repair.<ref name=\"Whitely, 2001, p. 312\">Whitely, 2001, p. 312.</ref> Italian air raids on Kotor badly damaged the minelayer ''Kobac'', which was beached to prevent sinking.<ref name=\"Enrico Cernuschi pp. 20\">Enrico Cernuschi, ''Le operazioni navali contro la Jugoslavia, 6\u201318 aprile 1941'', on \"Storia Militare\" n. 242, pp. 20 to 39.</ref>\n\nThe maritime patrol float-planes of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force flew reconnaissance and attack missions during the campaign, as well as providing air cover for mine-laying operations off Zara. Their operations included attacks on the Albanian port of [[Durr\u00ebs]], as well as strikes against Italian re-supply convoys to Albania. On 9 April, one [[Dornier Do 22]]K floatplane notably took on an Italian convoy of 12 steamers with an escort of eight destroyers crossing the Adriatic during the day, attacking single-handed in the face of intense AA fire.<ref>Shores, et al., 1987, p. 218.</ref> No Italian ships, however, were sunk by Yugoslav forces;<ref name=\"Enrico Cernuschi pp. 20\"/> an Italian tanker was claimed damaged by a near miss off the Italian coast near [[Bari]].\n\nThe Royal Yugoslav Navy also had at its disposal four large, heavily armed and armoured river [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s in its riverine flotilla. They were used to patrol the Danube, Drava and Sava rivers in the northern parts of Yugoslavia and its border with Hungary. These monitors, ''Drava'', ''Sava'', ''Morava'' and ''Vardar'', had been inherited from the Austrian Navy at the end of World War I. All were of around 400-500t with a main armament of two 120&nbsp;mm guns, two or three 66&nbsp;mm guns, 120&nbsp;mm mortars, 40&nbsp;mm [[AA gun]]s and machine guns. At the start of the campaign they had carried out offensive operations by shelling the airfield at [[Moh\u00e1cs]] in Hungary on 6 April and again two days later, but had to begin withdrawing towards [[Novi Sad]] by 11 April after coming under repeated attack by German dive-bombers.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=223}}\n\nEarly in the morning of 12 April, a squadron of German Ju 87 dive-bombers attacked the Yugoslav monitors on the Danube. ''Drava'', commanded by Aleksandar Beri\u0107,<ref>{{cite book |title=Pomorska enciklopedija, Volume 2 |last=Krle\u017ea |first=Miroslav |author2=Vladislav Brajkovi\u0107 |author3=Petar Marde\u0161i\u0107 |page=240 |year=1972 |publisher=Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod }}</ref> was hit by several of them but they were unable to penetrate ''Drava'''s 300&nbsp;mm thick deck armour, until, by chance, one put a bomb straight down the funnel, killing 54 of the 67-man crew. During the attack anti-aircraft gunners on the monitors claimed three dive-bombers shot down.\nThe remaining three monitors were scuttled by their crews later on 12 April as German and Hungarian forces had occupied the bases and the river systems upon which they operated.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=224}}\n\n===Romanian involvement===\nWhile Romania did not take part in the actual invasion of Yugoslavia, it did provide artillery support for the German forces invading from its territory. Operating on orders from the 3rd Section of the Romanian General Staff, Romanian artillery opened fire against Yugoslav barges on the Danube on 6 April. Romanian and German units from the Romanian bank of the Danube repeatedly exchanged fire with Yugoslav forces between 6 and 11 April. The main Romanian force was at [[Berzasca|Liubcova]], consisting in a battery of 120 mm/L10 naval howitzers in a fortified position. Nearby, there was also a section (2 pieces) of 120 mm/L35 naval howitzers as well as a section of 47 mm light naval guns.<ref>George Cristian Maior, Enciclopedica Pub.

During the twelve days of combat the total casualty figures came to 558 men: 151 were listed as killed, 392 as wounded, and 15 as missing in action. During the XLI Panzer Corps drive on Belgrade, for example, the only officer killed in action fell victim to a civilian sniper's bullet. The Luftwaffe lost approximately 60 aircraft shot down over Yugoslavia, costing the lives of at least 70 aircrew. The Italian Army took heavier casualties in northern Albania from the Yugoslav offensive there (Italian casualties on all fronts during the invasion amounted to some 800 killed and 2,500 wounded<ref>Enrico Cernuschi, ''Le operazioni aeronavali contro la Jugoslavia, 6\u20138 aprile 1941'', in ''Storia Militare'' no. 242, p. 32.</ref>),<ref name=\"Fatutta & Covelli, 1975\"/> whilst the Italian Air Force lost approximately 10 aircraft shot down, with a further 22 damaged. The [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian Army]] suffered some 350 casualties (120 killed, 223 wounded and 13 missing in action) from the shelling by Yugoslav riverine forces of its frontier installations and in its attacks upon the Yugoslav frontier forces in Vojvodina,<ref name=\"Niehorster, 1998, p. 66\"/> with one quarter of a Hungarian parachute 'battalion' becoming casualties when a transport aircraft filled with 30 troops went down during an abortive drop on 12 April.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=222}} The Hungarians also lost five Fiat fighters and one [[Weiss WM-21 S\u00f3lyom]] reconnaissance aircraft during the fighting.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe Germans took between 254,000 and 345,000 Yugoslav prisoners (excluding a considerable number of ethnic Germans and Hungarians who had been conscripted into the Yugoslav Army and who were quickly released after screening) and the Italians took 30,000 more.{{sfn|US Army|1986|p=64}}<ref>Geschichte, p. 325</ref>\n\nApproximately 1,000 army and several hundred VVKJ personnel (including one mobile-workshop unit of six vehicles) escaped via Greece to Egypt.{{sfn|Cigli\u0107|Savi\u0107|2007|p=32}}\n\nIn their brief fight, the VVKJ suffered the loss of 49 aircraft to Axis fighters and anti-aircraft fire, with many more damaged beyond repair. These losses had cost the lives of 27 fighter pilots and 76 bomber aircrew. 85 more aircraft had been destroyed on the ground by air attack, while many others had been destroyed or disabled by their own crews, or had crashed during operations, or in evacuation flights.\n\nDespite these losses, more than 70 Yugoslav aircraft escaped to Allied territory, mostly to Greece, but eight Dornier and Savoia Marchetti bombers set course for the USSR, with four making it safely. Several dozen of the escapee aircraft were destroyed in a devastating strafing attack by the Italian air force on Paramitia airfield in Greece, with nine bombers and transports making it to Egypt. More than 300 operational, auxiliary and training aircraft were captured and passed on to the newly created [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]],{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=310}} Finland, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nAccording to the provisions of the surrender document, the Italians took possession of most of the Yugoslav Navy (one of its four destroyers, the ''Ljubljana'', had spent the campaign in dry-dock).<ref name=\"Whitely, 2001, p. 312\"/> However, in defiance of the said provisions, one destroyer, the ''Zagreb'', was blown up at Kotor by two of its junior officers and one of the British-built submarines and two MTBs succeeded in escaping to Alexandria in Egypt to continue to serve with the Allied cause.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=356}} A fourth destroyer was captured while under construction in the Kotor shipyard, the ''Split'', but the Regia Marina was not able to finish her before the armistice in 1943. Eventually, she was recovered after the war by the Yugoslavs and completed under the original name.<ref>Whitely, 2001, p. 313.</ref> Ten Yugoslav Navy maritime patrol float-planes escaped to Greece, with nine making it to Egypt, where they formed a squadron under RAF command.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=261}}\n\n==Armistice and surrender==\n[[File:Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1941-43.png|thumb|right|Occupation and partition of Yugoslavia 1941]]\n\nThe Axis victory was swift. As early as 14 April the Yugoslav high command had decided to seek an armistice and authorised the army and army group commanders to negotiate local ceasefires. That day the commanders of the 2nd and 5th Armies asked the Germans for terms, but were rejected. Only unconditional surrender could form the basis for negotiations they were told. That evening, the high command sent an emissary to the headquarters of the [[1st Panzer Group]] to ask for armistice, and in response General von Kleist sent the commander of the 2nd Army, von Weichs, to Belgrade to negotiate terms. He arrived on the afternoon of 15 April and drew up an armistice based on unconditional surrender.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nOn 16 April, a Yugoslav delegate arrived in Belgrade, but as he did not have authority to sign the document, he was given a draft of the agreement and an aircraft was placed at his disposal to bring in authorised representatives of the government. Finally, on 17 April, after only eleven days of fighting, the pre-coup Foreign Minister [[Aleksandar Cincar-Markovi\u0107]] and General [[Milojko Jankovi\u0107]] signed the armistice and unconditionally surrendered all Yugoslav troops. It came into effect the following day (18 April) at noon.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=63\u201364}} At the signing, the Hungarians and Bulgarians were represented by liaison officers, but they did not sign the document because their countries were not officially at war with Yugoslavia.{{sfn|US Army|1986|pp=63\u201364}} The Italian representative, Colonel Luigi Buonofati, signed the document after noting that \"the same terms are valid for the Italian army\".{{sfn|Dedijer|1956|p=9}}\n\nScholars have proposed a number of theories for the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]'s sudden collapse, including poor training and equipment, generals eager to secure a quick cessation of hostilities, and a sizeable Croatian and other non-Serb [[fifth column]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=63\u201368}}{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|pp=383\u2013388}}{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=28}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=204\u2013207}} According to Tomasevich, the insistence of the Yugoslav Army on defending all the borders assured its failure from the start. After the surrender, Yugoslavia was subsequently divided amongst Germany, Hungary, Italy and Bulgaria, with most of Serbia being occupied by Germany. The Italian-backed Croatian fascist leader [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] declared an [[Independent State of Croatia]] before the invasion was even over.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=52\u201353}} Many Serbian nationalists blamed the loss on \"fifth columnist\" Croats who stood to gain from Italian and German rule, ignoring the primary failure of the Yugoslav Army and its almost entirely Serbian leadership.<ref name=\"DoniaFine1994\">{{cite book|author1=Robert J.
