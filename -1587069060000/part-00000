The first edition (paperback) was published in Oct. 2010 by Doubleday in UK.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe book follows the early adventures of Bartimaeus in service to King Solomon.\n==Setting==\nThe story is set in a fantasy version of [[City of David|ancient Jerusalem]], during the reign of biblical King [[Solomon]], about 950BCE.\n\n==Principal characters==\n===Magicians===\n*'''Solomon''', biblical King of Israel, ~970-931BC\n*'''Asmira''', captain of the guard for Queen of Sheba\n*'''Balkis (Queen of Sheba)'''\n*'''[[Ezekiel]]''', a magician in service to Solomon\n*'''Khaba the Cruel'''\n\n===Spirits===\n*'''Bartimaeus''', a mid-level djinn\n*'''Faquarl''', a djinn\n*'''Ammet''', a marid\n*'''Spirit of the Ring'''\n*'''Philocretes''', an afrit\n\n===Organisations===\n*'''High Magicians''' of Solomon\n\n==Magical objects, spells and places==\n*'''Ring of Solomon'''\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{plot|date=January 2018}}\nThe story opens in [[Jerusalem]] with the djinni Bartimaeus currently in the service of one of the seventeen High Magicians of [[King Solomon]] of [[Israel]], whom the king rules with the use of a mighty Ring. Ezekiel commands Bartimaeus to retrieve a magical [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] from the ancient city of [[Eridu]]. Bartimaeus succeeds, and then tricks the [[magician (paranormal)|magician]] into commanding him to use the artefact against him. It sends a spurt of water at him, knocking him from his protective circle. Bartimaeus devours the old man and by the magician's death is released and returns to the Other Place.\n\nThe king, upon learning of Bartimaeus's murder of Ezekiel, is insulted that a mere djinni is the perpetrator. To make Bartimaeus pay for his actions he commands Khaba, an Egyptian and another of the seventeen, to summon Bartimaeus back into his service and punish him. The king also proposes to the queen of Sheba and is refused.\n\nThe scene shifts to the [[Sheba]]n capital of [[Marib]] where Balkis, the aforementioned queen, receives a message from a fierce [[marid]] supposedly in Solomon's service: either pay a ransom of 40 sacks of [[frankincense]] or be destroyed, and gives her two weeks to pay. Balkis decides to send her loyal guard captain Asmira to Jerusalem to assassinate Solomon.\n\nBack in Jerusalem, now in Khaba's service, Bartimaeus is commanded to perform many degrading jobs, including grain counting, sewage treatment, and [[artichoke]] collecting. Another unpleasant element is that one of his fellow [[slave]]s is his old rival Faquarl.  Khaba assembles the eight djinn under his command and informs them that they have been commissioned to build [[Solomon's Temple]] on the [[Temple Mount]] and that they are to build it without using any magic whatsoever.  Bartimaeus uses his trademark wit to infuriate Khaba and the magician unleashes his flail upon the djinn and threatens to place them in his essence cages (devices similar to the Mournful Orb in ''[[The Amulet of Samarkand]]'') should they displease him a second time.\n\nAt first, Khaba and his subordinate closely supervise the stages of construction but after a while they stop showing up at the building site and the attitudes of the djinn grow lax. They begin assuming nonhuman forms and start using magic to build the temple (both actions directly in violation of Solomon's edicts).  Several days later, Solomon makes an unexpected appearance on the building site. The other djinn manage to revert to human form and disguise their use of magic but Bartimaeus is caught in the form of a [[pygmy hippopotamus]] in a skirt (a comic reference to one of Solomon's 700 wives, \"the one from [[Moab]]\").  The king interrogates Bartimaeus and the djinni reluctantly admits his guilt while covering for the other spirits.  As Solomon prepares to use the Ring on Bartimaeus, the djinni resorts to grovelling to appease the king. Bartimaeus's pathetic display amuses Solomon, who agrees to spare the djinni's life and instead punishes him (and Khaba, whom Solomon blames for failing to keep his spirits in line) by sending them to hunt down the local bandits.\n\nSeveral days later, out in the [[desert]], Bartimaeus and Faquarl find and defeat bandits attacking the traveller Asmira. Faquarl insists on eating her but Bartimaeus hopes she can intercede with Khaba on their behalf. Asmira is then escorted to Jerusalem by Khaba and manages to persuade him to reluctantly dismiss the two djinn.  Faquarl gains his freedom but Bartimaeus is imprisoned in a small bottle by Khaba and his principal slave, the marid Ammet, as punishment for his earlier crimes.  Asmira tries to use her feminine wiles to convince Khaba to get her near Solomon but fails. Asmira frees Bartimaeus from the bottle and commands him as his new master to help her kill Solomon. The pair sneak through the palace gardens and scale the tower wall to Solomon's chamber, evading obstacles through Bartimaeus' magical efforts.\n\nThey encounter the king in his [[observatory]] and Asmira stabs him with her dagger, only to discover that it is an [[illusion]] set up to trap them.  Bartimaeus escapes, but Asmira is captured and taken before the true King Solomon.  Meanwhile Bartimaeus encounters the trapped [[afrit]] Philocretes and learns the secret behind Solomon and the Ring, that it causes immense pain to the bearer, in this case King Solomon.  He then sneaks into the chamber where Solomon is interrogating Asmira and steals the Ring.  Asmira takes the Ring from him, only to discover that its energies indeed inflict pain upon whoever touches it or uses it.  Solomon then maintains that he never sent any ransom demand to Sheba, which causes Asmira to doubt herself and her loyalty to Queen Balkis. In the end, Asmira refrains from killing the king, choosing instead to take the Ring back to Sheba in spite of Solomon's warnings and Bartimaeus' demoralising analysis of her motives.  Suddenly Khaba arrives, subdues both girl and djinni and claims the Ring for himself. Khaba commands the Spirit of the Ring to destroy several of his rival magicians as well as Solomon's palace, but Asmira manages to use her last throwing knife to slice off Khaba's finger, with the ring still on it, and commands Bartimaeus to throw it into the sea. Although weakened by his use of the Ring, Khaba attempts to destroy both Asmira and Solomon, who manage to hold off Khaba's other servants for a brief time.\n\nMeanwhile Bartimeaus has fled the palace with the powerful Ammet in hot pursuit.  The two eventually reach the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and, Bartimaeus dips the ring in the sea, fulfilling his command.  In an unexpected move, he then puts the Ring on and commands the Spirit to seal Ammet inside a wine jar at the bottom of the sea for a few thousand years. Returning to Jerusalem, Bartimaeus knocks out Khaba and returns the Ring to Asmira who gives it back to Solomon. The king imprisons Khaba and pardons both Asmira and Bartimaeus for their deeds.  Solomon then summons Queen Balkis to Jerusalem and clears up the misunderstanding.  However, a spiteful Balkis disowns her loyal guard from her service. Solomon then offers Asmira the opportunity to work for him instead.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Asmira willingly dismisses Bartimaeus, revealing her intention to turn down Solomon's offer in favour of choosing her own path in life, and the two part ways on friendly terms.\n\n==Reception==\nThe book received generally positive reception<ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Stroud |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7640705-the-ring-of-solomon |title=The Ring of Solomon (Bartimaeus, #0.5) by Jonathan Stroud \u2013 Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists |publisher=Goodreads.com |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> and was praised for its portrayal of complex characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatchamacallitreviews.blogspot.com/2010/11/ring-of-solomon-by-jonathan-stroud.html |title=Whatchamacallit Reviews: The Ring of Solomon: By Jonathan Stroud |website=Whatchamacallitreviews.blogspot.com |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Bartimaeus}}\n{{Jonathan Stroud}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ring of Solomon}}\n[[Category:Bartimaeus]]\n[[Category:2010 British novels]]\n[[Category:British children's novels]]\n[[Category:Children's fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Historical fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Israel]]\n[[Category:Doubleday (publisher) books]]\n[[Category:2010 children's books]]\n\n\n{{2010s-fantasy-novel-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{For|the legendary ring|Seal of Solomon}}{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox book  | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name          = The Ring of Solomon\n| title_orig    = \n| translator    = \n| image         = The Ring of Solomon.png\n| caption       = Original cover\n| author        = [[Jonathan Stroud]]\n| cover_artist  = \n| country       = UK\n| language      = English\n| genre         = [[Children's literature|Children's]], [[Fantasy novel]]\n| publisher     = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date  = 14 October 2010\n| media_type    = Print (paperback & hardback)\n| pages         = 448 pp (first edition, paperback)\n| isbn          = 1-4231-2372-7\n| oclc          = 758069020\n| preceded_by   = [[Ptolemy's Gate]]\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n'''''The Ring of Solomon''''' is a children's novel of [[alternate history]], [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].

Harris Chapel, built in 1892, is the oldest building on the campus.|alt=]]\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe school was founded in 1886 by [[Artemas Lester]], a [[Circuit rider (Religious)|circuit-riding]] Methodist minister who wanted to provide the residents of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] with an education. The college was funded in part by production from an agricultural program, or college farm. Students who could not afford education were allowed to work on the farm to earn tuition.\n\nOriginally known as '''McTyeire Institute''' for the small village where the school was located, the college struggled for the first year until an [[Athens, Georgia]], judge, [[Young Harris|Young L.G. Harris]], donated enough money to keep the school open. The school was later renamed '''Young Harris Institute''' and became Young Harris College in honor of its benefactor, as was the [[Young Harris, Georgia|surrounding town]] in 1895.<ref name=\"NEW\" /> A fire destroyed the college's main classroom building in 1911, but it was rebuilt by local townspeople and named Sharp Hall in honor of the college president at the time. The ''Young Harris Academy'' was founded in the late 19th century and provided a [[primary education]] for thousands of students until it closed after [[World War II]].<ref name=HIST>[http://www.yhc.edu/pages/yhc.php?id=1208 \"A History of YHC\"] Young Harris College website</ref>\n\n===Bequest===\nMargaret Adger Pitts, who died in 1998, left an estate valued at $192 million, mostly in [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] stock acquired by her father in the 1920s.

Harris Society (EBE) and Phi Delta Society (PD).\n\nDuring the 1960s, these organizations became more social than academic. YHDS was chartered as Upsilon Delta Sigma fraternity in 1967 and paired up with the Susan B. Harris Society, which became known as Sigma Beta Sigma sorority.

The college was funded in part by production from an agricultural program, or college farm. Students who could not afford education were allowed to work on the farm to earn tuition.\n\nOriginally known as '''McTyeire Institute''' for the small village where the school was located, the college struggled for the first year until an [[Athens, Georgia]], judge, [[Young Harris|Young L.G. Harris]], donated enough money to keep the school open. The school was later renamed '''Young Harris Institute''' and became Young Harris College in honor of its benefactor, as was the [[Young Harris, Georgia|surrounding town]] in 1895.<ref name=\"NEW\" /> A fire destroyed the college's main classroom building in 1911, but it was rebuilt by local townspeople and named Sharp Hall in honor of the college president at the time.

The Young Harris Debating Society (YHDS) and the Phi Chi Debating Society (PC) were academic in nature, and lasted through the 1950s. Young Harris women formed the literary societies Susan B. Harris Society (EBE) and Phi Delta Society (PD).\n\nDuring the 1960s, these organizations became more social than academic. YHDS was chartered as Upsilon Delta Sigma fraternity in 1967 and paired up with the Susan B. Harris Society, which became known as Sigma Beta Sigma sorority. Phi Chi fraternity linked to Phi Delta sorority. On January 3, 1968, Kappa Tau Omega became the third fraternity on campus with nine charter members. Alpha Iota formed as the third sorority in the early 1970s.<ref name=UDS>{{cite web|last=Rayburn|first=Eric|title=Upsilon Delta Sigma History|url=http://www.upsilondeltasigma.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=21&Itemid=17|work=1991|publisher=Upsilon Delta Sigma Fraternity|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>  In the fall of 1987, [http://www.zetapi.org/Page.aspx?PageControlID=1&PageContentID=1 Zeta Pi] formed as the fourth fraternity on campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zetapi.org/Page.aspx?PageControlID=1&PageContentID=1 |title=Zeta Pi Fraternity - Young Harris College |publisher=Zetapi.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\nOn February 19, 2010, Young Harris college gained its first nationally affiliated fraternity when 28 undergraduate men formed [[Kappa Sigma]]'s Rho-Pi chapter.

Planetarium Shows are featured at the O. Wayne Rollins Planetarium. There are three student publications: the Corn Creek Revue literary magazine, the Mosaic religious-life publication and the Enotah annual yearbook.\n\nCommunity service opportunities are offered through Greek societies, clubs, and religious organizations, as well as off-campus community organizations.\n\n===Dining and recreation===\nDining, recreational and student-center activities, movies, and games are available at the Rollins Campus Center, which also houses a library. Dining options include choices of dining-hall meals and two on-campus chain restaurants. Students at Young Harris College purchase a meal plan. Outside of the meal plan, students may also visit diners and restaurants in Young Harris and nearby towns.\n\nOff Campus recreational activities are available, as well. Area lakes and rivers offer boating, swimming, skiing, rafting, and kayaking. Local parks and other organizations provide picnicking areas, hiking trails, farms, and vineyards. Further exploration may include caving and mountain climbing. Several small towns in Georgia and North Carolina, within a 30-minute drive of campus, feature theaters, galleries, antique stores, thrift shops, and shopping centers.\n\nCupid Falls waterfall is within easy walking distance of campus. Day trips may be made to [[Chatuge Lake|Lake Chatuge]], [[Vogel State Park]], and [[Brasstown Bald]]. The nearest metropolitan cities are [[Atlanta]], Georgia, and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] (each approximately a two-hour drive from Young Harris).\n\n==Alumni==\nYoung Harris College is highly regarded in Georgia and has had more of an impact on the state's politics and society than would be expected from a small school in the mountains.{{Citation needed|reason=This may be true, but needs a reference citation from an outside source.|date=March 2014}} Over the last 100+ years, many Young Harris students have chosen careers in public service; the ministry and teaching have been traditional vocations.

She roasts, crushes and brews the coffee on the spot.]]\nThe '''culture in Africa''' is varied and manifold, consisting of a mixture of countries with various tribes that each have their own unique characteristic from the continent of [[Africa]]. It is a product of the diverse populations that today inhabit the continent of Africa and the [[African Diaspora]]. African culture is expressed in its arts and crafts, folklore and religion, clothing, cuisine, music and languages.<ref>{{Cite web|title = African Culture and People|url = http://goafrica.about.com/od/peopleandculture/|website = About.com Travel|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref> Expressions of culture are abundant within Africa, with large amounts of cultural diversity being found not only across different countries but also within single countries. Even though African cultures are widely diverse, they are also, when closely studied, seen to have many similarities; for example, the morals they uphold, their love and respect for their culture as well as the strong respect they hold for the aged and the important, i.e. [[Monarchies in Africa|kings]] and chiefs.\n\nAfrica has influenced and been influenced by other continents. This can be portrayed in the willingness to adapt to the ever-changing modern world rather than staying rooted to their static culture. The Westernized few, persuaded by European culture and Christianity, first denied African traditional culture, but with the increase of African [[nationalism]], a cultural recovery occurred. The governments of most African nations encourage national dance and music groups, museums, and to a lower degree, artists and writers.\n\n==Historical overview==\n[[File:Egypt bookofthedead.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sample of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' of the [[scribe]] Nebqed, c.

The French were able to accept an African as French if that person gave up their African culture and adopted French ways. Knowledge of the Portuguese language and culture and abandonment of traditional African ways defined one as civilized.<ref>Khapoya, op. cit. p. 126f</ref> [[Kenya]]n social commentator Mwiti Mugambi argues that the future of Africa can only be forged from accepting and mending the sociocultural present. For Mugambi, colonial cultural hangovers, pervasive Western cultural inundation, and aid-giving arm-twisting donors are, he argues, here to stay and no amount of looking into Africa's past will make them go away. However, [[Maulana Karenga]] states:\n{{Quotation|Our culture provides us with an ethos we must honor in both thought and practice. By ethos, we mean a people's self-understanding as well as its self-presentation in the world through its thought and practice in the other six areas of culture. It is above all a cultural challenge.

African arts and crafts find expression in a variety of [[woodcarving]]s, [[brass]] and [[leather]] art works. African arts and crafts also include [[sculpture]], [[painting]]s, [[pottery]], [[ceremonial]] and [[religious]] [[headgear]] and [[Clothing|dress]]. [[Maulana Karenga]] states that in African art, the object was not as important as the soul force behind the creation of the object. He also states that All art must be revolutionary and in being revolutionary it must be collective, committing, and functional.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n[[File:Masques BaKongo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kongo people|BaKongo]] masks from the [[Bas-Congo|Kongo Central region]]]]\nCertain African cultures have always placed emphasis on personal appearance and [[jewelry]] has remained an important personal [[Fashion accessory|accessory]]. Many pieces of such jewelry are made of [[cowry]] shells and similar materials. Similarly, [[mask]]s are made with elaborate designs and are an important part of some cultures in Africa. Masks are used in various ceremonies depicting ancestors and spirits, mythological characters and deities.\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum L54.5 Fragment of a Head (3).jpg|thumb|A terra-cotta head sculpture (1100-1500) of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], showing extraordinary naturalism. This head represents the oni, or king of [[Ife]].]]\nIn many traditional arts and craft traditions in Africa, certain themes significant to those particular cultures recur, including a couple, a woman with a child, a male with a weapon or animal, and an outsider or a stranger. Couples may represent ancestors, community founder, married couple or twins. The couple theme rarely exhibits intimacy of men and women. The mother with the child or children reveals intense desire of the women to have children. The theme is also representative of mother mars and the people as her children. The man with the weapon or animal theme symbolizes honor and power. A stranger may be from some other tribe or someone from a different country, and more distorted portrayal of the stranger indicates proportionately greater gap from the stranger.\n\n==Folklore and religion==\n{{See also|African traditional religions|Religion in Africa}}\n[[File:Central mosque in Nouakchott.jpg|thumb|right|Central mosque in [[Nouakchott]], [[Mauritania]]]]\nLike all human cultures, African folklore and religion represents a variety of social facets of the various cultures in Africa.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Like almost all civilizations and cultures, flood myths have been circulating in different parts of Africa. Culture and religion share space and are deeply intertwined in African cultures. In Ethiopia, Christianity and Islam form the core aspects of Ethiopian culture and inform dietary customs as well as rituals and rites.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, 1997, `History of the Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History, Lawrenceville, New Jersey.</ref> According to a [[Pygmy]] myth, Chameleon, hearing a strange noise in a tree, cut open its trunk and water came out in a great flood that spread all over the land.\n\n[[File:Kenyan dancers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kenya]]n boys and girls performing a traditional folklore dance]]\nFolktales also play an important role in many African cultures. Stories reflect a group cultural identity and preserving the stories of Africa will help preserve an entire culture. Storytelling affirms pride and identity in a culture. In Africa, stories are created by and for the ethnic group telling them. Different ethnic groups in Africa have different rituals or ceremonies for storytelling, which creates a sense of belonging to a cultural group. To outsiders hearing an ethnic group's stories, it provides an insight into the community's beliefs, views, and customs. For people within the community, it allows them to encompass their group's uniqueness. They show the human desires and fears of a group, such as love, marriage, and death. Folktales are also seen as a tool for education and entertainment. They provide a way for children to understand the material and social environment. Every story has a moral to teach people, such as goodwill prevail over evil. For entertainment, stories are set in fantastic, non-human worlds. Often, the main character of the story would be a talking animal or something unnatural would happen to a human character. Even though folktales are for entertainment, they bring a sense of belonging and pride to communities in Africa.<ref>Florence, Namulundah. The Bukusu of Kenya: Folktales, Culture and Social Identities. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic, 2011. Print.</ref>\n\nThere are different types of African stories: animal tales and day-to-day tales. Animal tales more oriented towards entertainment, but still have morals and lessons to them. Animal tales are normally divided into trickster tales and ogre tales. In the animal tales, a certain animal would always have the same character or role in each story so the audience does not have to worry about characterization. The Hare was always the trickster, clever and cunning, while the Hyena was always being tricked by the Hare. Ogres are always cruel, greedy monsters. The messengers in all the stories were the Birds. Day-to-Day tales are the most serious tales, never including humor, that explained the everyday life and struggles of an African community. These tales take on matters such as famine, escape from death, courtship, and family matters, using a song form when the climax of the story was being told.\n\nAfrican stories all have a certain structure to them. Villagers would gather around a common meeting place at the end of the day to listen and tell their stories. Storytellers had certain commands to start and end the stories, \"Ugai Itha\" to get the audience's attention and begin the story, and \"Rukirika\" to signal the end of a tale. Each scene of a story is depicted with two characters at a time, so the audience does not get overwhelmed. In each story, victims are able to overcome their predators and take justice out on the culprit. Certain tools were used in African folktales. For example, idiophones, such as drums, were used to make the sounds of different animals. Repetition and call-back techniques in the form of prose or poem were also used to get the audience involved in the stories.<ref>Mwangi, Rose. Kikuyu Folktales.

The latter garment is basically cotton cloth, about 90&nbsp; cm wide, woven in long strips which are then sewn together. Sometimes shiny threads are woven into the [[Textile|fabric]] for an elegant effect. Men wear pants and a knee-length shirt with a white [[collar (clothing)|collar]], and perhaps a sweater. Men often wear knee-high socks, while women might not wear socks at all. Men as well as women wear shawls, the ''netela''.\n[[File:Traditional Maasai Dance.jpg|thumb|right|Maasai wearing traditional clothes named ''Matavuvale'' while performing [[African dance#Examples|Adumu]], a traditional dance]]\n\nZulus wear a variety of attire, both traditional for ceremonial or culturally celebratory occasions, and modern westernised clothing for everyday use. Traditional male clothing is usually light, consisting of a two-part apron (similar to a loincloth) used to cover the genitals and buttocks. The front piece is called the ''umutsha'' (pronounced {{IPA-zu|umtifash}}), and is usually made of [[Springbok (antelope)|springbok]] or other animal hide twisted into different bands which cover the genitals. The rear piece, called the ''ibheshu'' {{IPA|[ibe\u02d0\u0283u]}}, is made of a single piece of springbok or [[cattle]] hide, and its length is usually used as an indicator of age and social position; longer amabheshu (plural of ibheshu) are worn by older men. Married men will usually also wear a headband, called the ''umqhele'' {{IPA|[um\u01c3\u02b0\u025ble]}}, which is usually also made of springbok hide, or [[leopard]] hide by men of higher social status, such as chiefs. Zulu men will also wear cow tails as bracelets and anklets called ''imishokobezi'' {{IPA|[imi\u0283o\u0260o\u0253\u025b\u02d0zi]}} during ceremonies and rituals, such as weddings or dances.\n\nIn the Muslim parts of Africa, daily attire also often reflects Islamic tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|African cuisine}}\n[[File:Fufu.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Fufu]]'' (right) is a staple meal in [[West Africa]] and [[Central Africa]]. It is served here with some [[peanut soup]].]]\nThe various cuisines of Africa use a combination of locally available [[fruit]]s, [[cereal grain]]s and [[vegetable]]s, as well as [[milk]] and [[meat]] products. In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features a preponderance of milk, [[curd]] and [[whey]] products. In much of tropical Africa, however, cow's milk is rare and cannot be produced locally (owing to various diseases that affect livestock). The continent's diverse demographic makeup is reflected in the many different eating and drinking habits, dishes, and preparation techniques of its manifold populations.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |title=The African Cookbook |author=Bea Sandler |others=Diane and Leo Dillon (Illust.) |publisher=Carol Publishing Group |year=1993 |isbn=0-8065-1398-5 |accessdate=2008-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216154309/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |archive-date=2008-12-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However it is important to consider the affordability of and access of these products on daily basis.\n\nIn [[Central Africa]], the basic ingredients are plantains and cassava. [[Fufu]]-like starchy foods (usually made from fermented cassava roots) are served with grilled meat and sauces. A variety of local ingredients are used while preparing other dishes like [[spinach]] stew, cooked with tomato, peppers, chillis, onions, and peanut butter. Cassava plants are also consumed as cooked [[Leaf vegetable|greens]]. Groundnut (peanut) stew is also prepared, containing [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[okra]], [[ginger]], and other spices. Another favorite is Bambara, a [[porridge]] of rice, peanut butter, and sugar. Beef and chicken are favorite meat dishes, but game meat preparations containing [[crocodile]], [[monkey]], [[antelope]] and [[warthog]] are also served occasionally.\n[[File:Cuscus.jpg|thumb|left|Fresh [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan]] ''[[couscous]]'' with vegetables and chickpeas]]\n\nThe cuisine of the [[African Great Lakes]] region varies from area to area. In the inland savannah, the traditional cuisine of cattle-keeping peoples is distinctive in that meat products are generally absent. [[Cattle]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s were regarded as a form of [[currency]] and a store of wealth, and are not generally consumed as food. In some areas, traditional peoples consume the milk and blood of cattle, but rarely the meat. Elsewhere, other peoples are farmers who grow a variety of grains and vegetables. [[Maize]] (corn) is the basis of [[ugali]], the East African version of West Africa's [[fufu]]. Ugali is a starch dish eaten with meats or stews. In [[Uganda]], steamed, green [[banana]]s called [[matoke]] provide the starch filler of many meals.\n\nIn the [[Horn of Africa]], the main traditional dishes in [[Ethiopian cuisine]] and [[Eritrean cuisine]] are ''[[Wat (food)|tsebhis]]'' (stews) served with ''[[injera]]''<ref name=\"webcitation\">[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/WARSAISANDIEGO/our_culture.htm&date=2009-10-25+11:44:57 \"Eritrean Food Practices.\"] [https://www.webcitation.org Webcitation.org].

Eritrean and [[Ethiopian cuisine]] (especially in the northern half) are very similar, given the shared history of the two countries. The related [[Somali cuisine]] consists of an exotic [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] of diverse culinary influences. Varieties of ''bariis'' (rice), the most popular probably being [[basmati]], usually serve as the main dish. ''Xalwo'' (halwo) or [[halva]] is a popular confection served during special occasions such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] celebrations or wedding receptions.<ref>Barlin Ali, ''Somali Cuisine'', (AuthorHouse: 2007), p.79</ref> After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using [[frankincense]] (''lubaan'') or [[incense]] (''cuunsi''), which is prepared inside an [[Censer|incense burner]] referred to as a ''[[dabqaad]]''. All food is served [[halal]].\n[[File:Potjiekos2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''[[Potjiekos]]'' is a traditional [[Afrikaner]] stew made with meat and vegetables and cooked over coals in [[cast-iron]] pots.]]\n\nThe roots of [[North African cuisine]] can be traced back to the ancient empires of North Africa, particularly in Egypt where many of the country's dishes and culinary traditions date back to ancient Egypt. Over several centuries traders, travelers, invaders, migrants and immigrants all have influenced the cuisine of North Africa. Most of the North African countries today have several similar dishes, sometimes almost the same dish with a different name (the Moroccan ''tangia'' and the Tunisian ''coucha'' are both essentially the same dish: a meat stew prepared in an [[urn]] and cooked overnight in a public oven), sometimes with a slight change in ingredients and cooking style. To add to the confusion, two completely different dishes may also share the same name (for example, a \"tajine\" dish is a slow-cooked stew in Morocco, whereas the Tunisian \"tajine\" is a baked [[omelette]]/[[quiche]]-like dish). There are noticeable differences between the cooking styles of different nations &ndash; there's the sophisticated, full-bodied flavours of [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan palace cookery]], the fiery dishes of [[Tunisian cuisine]], and the humbler, simpler cuisines of [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Foods of North Africa |url=http://www.specialtyfood.com/do/news/ViewNewsArticle?id=2402 |first=Paula |last=Wolfert |publisher=[[National Association for the Specialty Food Trade]], Inc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021074848/http://specialtyfood.com/do/news/ViewNewsArticle?id=2402 |archivedate=2007-10-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe cooking of Southern Africa is sometimes called 'rainbow cuisine', as the food in this region is a blend of many culinary traditions, including those of the [[Khoisan people|Khoisan]], [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[European cuisine|European]] and [[Asian cuisine|Asian]] populations. Basic ingredients include seafood, meat products (including wild game), poultry, as well as grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. Fruits include [[apple]]s, [[grape]]s, [[mango]]es, [[banana]]s and [[papaya]]s, [[avocado]], [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[peach]]es and [[apricot]]s. Desserts may simply be fruit. However, there are some more western style puddings, such as the Angolan [[Cocada amarela]], which was inspired by [[Portuguese cuisine]]. Meat products include lamb, as well as game like [[venison]], [[ostrich]], and [[impala]]. The seafood includes a wide variety such as [[crayfish]], [[prawn]]s, [[tuna]], [[mussel]]s, [[oyster]]s, calamari, [[mackerel]], and [[lobster]]. There are also several types of traditional and modern [[alcoholic beverage]]s including many European-style [[beer]]s.\n\nA typical West African meal is heavy with [[starch]]y items, meat, spices, and flavors. A wide array of staples are eaten across the region, including those of Fufu, [[Banku]] and [[Kenkey]] (originating from [[Ghana]]), Foutou, [[Couscous]], T\u00f4, and [[Garri]], which are served alongside soups and stews. Fufu is often made from starchy [[root vegetable]]s such as [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[Xanthosoma|cocoyams]], or [[cassava]], but also from cereal grains like millet, sorghum or plantains. The staple grain or starch varies region to region and ethnic group to ethnic group, although corn has gained significant ground as it is cheap, swells to greater volumes and creates a beautiful white final product that is greatly desired. Banku and Kenkey are maize dough staples, and Gari is made from dried grated cassavas. Rice-dishes are also widely eaten in the region, especially in the dry [[Sahel]] belt inland. Examples of these include [[Benachin]] from [[The Gambia]] and [[Jollof rice]], a pan-West African rice dish similar to Arab [[kabsah]].\n\n==African music==\n{{See also|African popular music|Music of Africa}}\n[[File:Kwarastatedrummers.jpg|thumb|[[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] [[drum]]mers at celebration in Ojumo Oro, [[Kwara State]], [[Nigeria]]]]\nTraditional Sub-Saharan African music is as diverse as the region's various populations. The common perception of Sub-Saharan African music is that it is rhythmic music centered on the drums, and indeed, a large part of Sub-Saharan music, mainly among speakers of [[Niger\u2013Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages]], is rhythmic and centered on the drum. Sub-Saharan music is polyrhythmic, usually consisting of multiple rhythms in one composition. Dance involves moving multiple body parts. These aspects of Sub-Saharan music were transferred to the new world by enslaved Sub-Saharan Africans and can be seen in its influence on music forms as [[Samba]], [[Jazz]], [[Rhythm and Blues]], [[Rock & Roll]], [[Salsa music|Salsa]], and [[Rap]] music.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bowden, Rob(2007). Africa South of the Sahara. Coughlan Publishing: p. 40, {{ISBN|1-4034-9910-1}}.</ref>\n\nOther African musical traditions also involve strings, horns, and very little poly-rhythms. Music from the eastern Sahel and along the Nile, among the [[Nilo-Saharan]], made extensive use of strings and horns in ancient times. Dancing involve swaying body movements and footwork. Among the [[Khoisan]]s extensive use of string instruments with emphasis on footwork.<ref>[[Christopher Ehret]], (2002). The Civilizations of Africa. Charlottesville: University of Virginia, p. 103, {{ISBN|0-8139-2085-X}}.</ref>\n\nModern Sub-Saharan African music has been influenced by music from the New World (Jazz, Salsa, Rhythm and Blues etc.). Popular styles include [[Mbalax]] in [[Senegal]] and [[Gambia]], [[Highlife]] in [[Ghana]], [[Zoblazo]] in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], [[Makossa]] in [[Cameroon]], [[Soukous]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Kizomba]] in [[Angola]], and [[Mbaqanga]] in [[South Africa]].

Among the most prominent languages spoken are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]. Very few countries of Africa use any single language and for this reason, several official languages coexist, African and European.

It is a product of the diverse populations that today inhabit the continent of Africa and the [[African Diaspora]]. African culture is expressed in its arts and crafts, folklore and religion, clothing, cuisine, music and languages.<ref>{{Cite web|title = African Culture and People|url = http://goafrica.about.com/od/peopleandculture/|website = About.com Travel|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref> Expressions of culture are abundant within Africa, with large amounts of cultural diversity being found not only across different countries but also within single countries. Even though African cultures are widely diverse, they are also, when closely studied, seen to have many similarities; for example, the morals they uphold, their love and respect for their culture as well as the strong respect they hold for the aged and the important, i.e. [[Monarchies in Africa|kings]] and chiefs.\n\nAfrica has influenced and been influenced by other continents. This can be portrayed in the willingness to adapt to the ever-changing modern world rather than staying rooted to their static culture. The Westernized few, persuaded by European culture and Christianity, first denied African traditional culture, but with the increase of African [[nationalism]], a cultural recovery occurred. The governments of most African nations encourage national dance and music groups, museums, and to a lower degree, artists and writers.\n\n==Historical overview==\n[[File:Egypt bookofthedead.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sample of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' of the [[scribe]] Nebqed, c.

For Mugambi, colonial cultural hangovers, pervasive Western cultural inundation, and aid-giving arm-twisting donors are, he argues, here to stay and no amount of looking into Africa's past will make them go away. However, [[Maulana Karenga]] states:\n{{Quotation|Our culture provides us with an ethos we must honor in both thought and practice.

African arts and crafts also include [[sculpture]], [[painting]]s, [[pottery]], [[ceremonial]] and [[religious]] [[headgear]] and [[Clothing|dress]]. [[Maulana Karenga]] states that in African art, the object was not as important as the soul force behind the creation of the object. He also states that All art must be revolutionary and in being revolutionary it must be collective, committing, and functional.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n[[File:Masques BaKongo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kongo people|BaKongo]] masks from the [[Bas-Congo|Kongo Central region]]]]\nCertain African cultures have always placed emphasis on personal appearance and [[jewelry]] has remained an important personal [[Fashion accessory|accessory]].

Masks are used in various ceremonies depicting ancestors and spirits, mythological characters and deities.\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum L54.5 Fragment of a Head (3).jpg|thumb|A terra-cotta head sculpture (1100-1500) of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], showing extraordinary naturalism. This head represents the oni, or king of [[Ife]].]]\nIn many traditional arts and craft traditions in Africa, certain themes significant to those particular cultures recur, including a couple, a woman with a child, a male with a weapon or animal, and an outsider or a stranger. Couples may represent ancestors, community founder, married couple or twins. The couple theme rarely exhibits intimacy of men and women. The mother with the child or children reveals intense desire of the women to have children. The theme is also representative of mother mars and the people as her children. The man with the weapon or animal theme symbolizes honor and power. A stranger may be from some other tribe or someone from a different country, and more distorted portrayal of the stranger indicates proportionately greater gap from the stranger.\n\n==Folklore and religion==\n{{See also|African traditional religions|Religion in Africa}}\n[[File:Central mosque in Nouakchott.jpg|thumb|right|Central mosque in [[Nouakchott]], [[Mauritania]]]]\nLike all human cultures, African folklore and religion represents a variety of social facets of the various cultures in Africa.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Like almost all civilizations and cultures, flood myths have been circulating in different parts of Africa. Culture and religion share space and are deeply intertwined in African cultures. In Ethiopia, Christianity and Islam form the core aspects of Ethiopian culture and inform dietary customs as well as rituals and rites.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, 1997, `History of the Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History, Lawrenceville, New Jersey.</ref> According to a [[Pygmy]] myth, Chameleon, hearing a strange noise in a tree, cut open its trunk and water came out in a great flood that spread all over the land.\n\n[[File:Kenyan dancers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kenya]]n boys and girls performing a traditional folklore dance]]\nFolktales also play an important role in many African cultures. Stories reflect a group cultural identity and preserving the stories of Africa will help preserve an entire culture. Storytelling affirms pride and identity in a culture. In Africa, stories are created by and for the ethnic group telling them. Different ethnic groups in Africa have different rituals or ceremonies for storytelling, which creates a sense of belonging to a cultural group. To outsiders hearing an ethnic group's stories, it provides an insight into the community's beliefs, views, and customs. For people within the community, it allows them to encompass their group's uniqueness. They show the human desires and fears of a group, such as love, marriage, and death. Folktales are also seen as a tool for education and entertainment. They provide a way for children to understand the material and social environment. Every story has a moral to teach people, such as goodwill prevail over evil. For entertainment, stories are set in fantastic, non-human worlds. Often, the main character of the story would be a talking animal or something unnatural would happen to a human character. Even though folktales are for entertainment, they bring a sense of belonging and pride to communities in Africa.<ref>Florence, Namulundah. The Bukusu of Kenya: Folktales, Culture and Social Identities. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic, 2011. Print.</ref>\n\nThere are different types of African stories: animal tales and day-to-day tales. Animal tales more oriented towards entertainment, but still have morals and lessons to them. Animal tales are normally divided into trickster tales and ogre tales. In the animal tales, a certain animal would always have the same character or role in each story so the audience does not have to worry about characterization. The Hare was always the trickster, clever and cunning, while the Hyena was always being tricked by the Hare. Ogres are always cruel, greedy monsters. The messengers in all the stories were the Birds. Day-to-Day tales are the most serious tales, never including humor, that explained the everyday life and struggles of an African community. These tales take on matters such as famine, escape from death, courtship, and family matters, using a song form when the climax of the story was being told.\n\nAfrican stories all have a certain structure to them. Villagers would gather around a common meeting place at the end of the day to listen and tell their stories. Storytellers had certain commands to start and end the stories, \"Ugai Itha\" to get the audience's attention and begin the story, and \"Rukirika\" to signal the end of a tale. Each scene of a story is depicted with two characters at a time, so the audience does not get overwhelmed. In each story, victims are able to overcome their predators and take justice out on the culprit. Certain tools were used in African folktales. For example, idiophones, such as drums, were used to make the sounds of different animals. Repetition and call-back techniques in the form of prose or poem were also used to get the audience involved in the stories.<ref>Mwangi, Rose. Kikuyu Folktales.

The latter garment is basically cotton cloth, about 90&nbsp; cm wide, woven in long strips which are then sewn together. Sometimes shiny threads are woven into the [[Textile|fabric]] for an elegant effect. Men wear pants and a knee-length shirt with a white [[collar (clothing)|collar]], and perhaps a sweater. Men often wear knee-high socks, while women might not wear socks at all. Men as well as women wear shawls, the ''netela''.\n[[File:Traditional Maasai Dance.jpg|thumb|right|Maasai wearing traditional clothes named ''Matavuvale'' while performing [[African dance#Examples|Adumu]], a traditional dance]]\n\nZulus wear a variety of attire, both traditional for ceremonial or culturally celebratory occasions, and modern westernised clothing for everyday use. Traditional male clothing is usually light, consisting of a two-part apron (similar to a loincloth) used to cover the genitals and buttocks. The front piece is called the ''umutsha'' (pronounced {{IPA-zu|umtifash}}), and is usually made of [[Springbok (antelope)|springbok]] or other animal hide twisted into different bands which cover the genitals. The rear piece, called the ''ibheshu'' {{IPA|[ibe\u02d0\u0283u]}}, is made of a single piece of springbok or [[cattle]] hide, and its length is usually used as an indicator of age and social position; longer amabheshu (plural of ibheshu) are worn by older men. Married men will usually also wear a headband, called the ''umqhele'' {{IPA|[um\u01c3\u02b0\u025ble]}}, which is usually also made of springbok hide, or [[leopard]] hide by men of higher social status, such as chiefs. Zulu men will also wear cow tails as bracelets and anklets called ''imishokobezi'' {{IPA|[imi\u0283o\u0260o\u0253\u025b\u02d0zi]}} during ceremonies and rituals, such as weddings or dances.\n\nIn the Muslim parts of Africa, daily attire also often reflects Islamic tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|African cuisine}}\n[[File:Fufu.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Fufu]]'' (right) is a staple meal in [[West Africa]] and [[Central Africa]].

In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features a preponderance of milk, [[curd]] and [[whey]] products. In much of tropical Africa, however, cow's milk is rare and cannot be produced locally (owing to various diseases that affect livestock). The continent's diverse demographic makeup is reflected in the many different eating and drinking habits, dishes, and preparation techniques of its manifold populations.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |title=The African Cookbook |author=Bea Sandler |others=Diane and Leo Dillon (Illust.) |publisher=Carol Publishing Group |year=1993 |isbn=0-8065-1398-5 |accessdate=2008-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216154309/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |archive-date=2008-12-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However it is important to consider the affordability of and access of these products on daily basis.\n\nIn [[Central Africa]], the basic ingredients are plantains and cassava. [[Fufu]]-like starchy foods (usually made from fermented cassava roots) are served with grilled meat and sauces. A variety of local ingredients are used while preparing other dishes like [[spinach]] stew, cooked with tomato, peppers, chillis, onions, and peanut butter. Cassava plants are also consumed as cooked [[Leaf vegetable|greens]]. Groundnut (peanut) stew is also prepared, containing [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[okra]], [[ginger]], and other spices. Another favorite is Bambara, a [[porridge]] of rice, peanut butter, and sugar. Beef and chicken are favorite meat dishes, but game meat preparations containing [[crocodile]], [[monkey]], [[antelope]] and [[warthog]] are also served occasionally.\n[[File:Cuscus.jpg|thumb|left|Fresh [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan]] ''[[couscous]]'' with vegetables and chickpeas]]\n\nThe cuisine of the [[African Great Lakes]] region varies from area to area. In the inland savannah, the traditional cuisine of cattle-keeping peoples is distinctive in that meat products are generally absent. [[Cattle]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s were regarded as a form of [[currency]] and a store of wealth, and are not generally consumed as food. In some areas, traditional peoples consume the milk and blood of cattle, but rarely the meat. Elsewhere, other peoples are farmers who grow a variety of grains and vegetables. [[Maize]] (corn) is the basis of [[ugali]], the East African version of West Africa's [[fufu]]. Ugali is a starch dish eaten with meats or stews. In [[Uganda]], steamed, green [[banana]]s called [[matoke]] provide the starch filler of many meals.\n\nIn the [[Horn of Africa]], the main traditional dishes in [[Ethiopian cuisine]] and [[Eritrean cuisine]] are ''[[Wat (food)|tsebhis]]'' (stews) served with ''[[injera]]''<ref name=\"webcitation\">[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/WARSAISANDIEGO/our_culture.htm&date=2009-10-25+11:44:57 \"Eritrean Food Practices.\"] [https://www.webcitation.org Webcitation.org].

Eritrean and [[Ethiopian cuisine]] (especially in the northern half) are very similar, given the shared history of the two countries. The related [[Somali cuisine]] consists of an exotic [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] of diverse culinary influences. Varieties of ''bariis'' (rice), the most popular probably being [[basmati]], usually serve as the main dish. ''Xalwo'' (halwo) or [[halva]] is a popular confection served during special occasions such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] celebrations or wedding receptions.<ref>Barlin Ali, ''Somali Cuisine'', (AuthorHouse: 2007), p.79</ref> After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using [[frankincense]] (''lubaan'') or [[incense]] (''cuunsi''), which is prepared inside an [[Censer|incense burner]] referred to as a ''[[dabqaad]]''.

Over several centuries traders, travelers, invaders, migrants and immigrants all have influenced the cuisine of North Africa. Most of the North African countries today have several similar dishes, sometimes almost the same dish with a different name (the Moroccan ''tangia'' and the Tunisian ''coucha'' are both essentially the same dish: a meat stew prepared in an [[urn]] and cooked overnight in a public oven), sometimes with a slight change in ingredients and cooking style. To add to the confusion, two completely different dishes may also share the same name (for example, a \"tajine\" dish is a slow-cooked stew in Morocco, whereas the Tunisian \"tajine\" is a baked [[omelette]]/[[quiche]]-like dish). There are noticeable differences between the cooking styles of different nations &ndash; there's the sophisticated, full-bodied flavours of [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan palace cookery]], the fiery dishes of [[Tunisian cuisine]], and the humbler, simpler cuisines of [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Foods of North Africa |url=http://www.specialtyfood.com/do/news/ViewNewsArticle?id=2402 |first=Paula |last=Wolfert |publisher=[[National Association for the Specialty Food Trade]], Inc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021074848/http://specialtyfood.com/do/news/ViewNewsArticle?id=2402 |archivedate=2007-10-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe cooking of Southern Africa is sometimes called 'rainbow cuisine', as the food in this region is a blend of many culinary traditions, including those of the [[Khoisan people|Khoisan]], [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[European cuisine|European]] and [[Asian cuisine|Asian]] populations.

The seafood includes a wide variety such as [[crayfish]], [[prawn]]s, [[tuna]], [[mussel]]s, [[oyster]]s, calamari, [[mackerel]], and [[lobster]]. There are also several types of traditional and modern [[alcoholic beverage]]s including many European-style [[beer]]s.\n\nA typical West African meal is heavy with [[starch]]y items, meat, spices, and flavors. A wide array of staples are eaten across the region, including those of Fufu, [[Banku]] and [[Kenkey]] (originating from [[Ghana]]), Foutou, [[Couscous]], T\u00f4, and [[Garri]], which are served alongside soups and stews. Fufu is often made from starchy [[root vegetable]]s such as [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[Xanthosoma|cocoyams]], or [[cassava]], but also from cereal grains like millet, sorghum or plantains. The staple grain or starch varies region to region and ethnic group to ethnic group, although corn has gained significant ground as it is cheap, swells to greater volumes and creates a beautiful white final product that is greatly desired. Banku and Kenkey are maize dough staples, and Gari is made from dried grated cassavas. Rice-dishes are also widely eaten in the region, especially in the dry [[Sahel]] belt inland. Examples of these include [[Benachin]] from [[The Gambia]] and [[Jollof rice]], a pan-West African rice dish similar to Arab [[kabsah]].\n\n==African music==\n{{See also|African popular music|Music of Africa}}\n[[File:Kwarastatedrummers.jpg|thumb|[[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] [[drum]]mers at celebration in Ojumo Oro, [[Kwara State]], [[Nigeria]]]]\nTraditional Sub-Saharan African music is as diverse as the region's various populations. The common perception of Sub-Saharan African music is that it is rhythmic music centered on the drums, and indeed, a large part of Sub-Saharan music, mainly among speakers of [[Niger\u2013Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages]], is rhythmic and centered on the drum. Sub-Saharan music is polyrhythmic, usually consisting of multiple rhythms in one composition. Dance involves moving multiple body parts. These aspects of Sub-Saharan music were transferred to the new world by enslaved Sub-Saharan Africans and can be seen in its influence on music forms as [[Samba]], [[Jazz]], [[Rhythm and Blues]], [[Rock & Roll]], [[Salsa music|Salsa]], and [[Rap]] music.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bowden, Rob(2007). Africa South of the Sahara. Coughlan Publishing: p. 40, {{ISBN|1-4034-9910-1}}.</ref>\n\nOther African musical traditions also involve strings, horns, and very little poly-rhythms. Music from the eastern Sahel and along the Nile, among the [[Nilo-Saharan]], made extensive use of strings and horns in ancient times. Dancing involve swaying body movements and footwork. Among the [[Khoisan]]s extensive use of string instruments with emphasis on footwork.<ref>[[Christopher Ehret]], (2002). The Civilizations of Africa. Charlottesville: University of Virginia, p. 103, {{ISBN|0-8139-2085-X}}.</ref>\n\nModern Sub-Saharan African music has been influenced by music from the New World (Jazz, Salsa, Rhythm and Blues etc.). Popular styles include [[Mbalax]] in [[Senegal]] and [[Gambia]], [[Highlife]] in [[Ghana]], [[Zoblazo]] in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], [[Makossa]] in [[Cameroon]], [[Soukous]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Kizomba]] in [[Angola]], and [[Mbaqanga]] in [[South Africa]]. New World styles like Salsa, R&B/Rap, Reggae, and Zouk also have widespread popularity.\n\nLike the musical genres of the [[Nile Valley]] and the [[Horn of Africa]],<ref name=\"Mdacacos\">{{cite book|last=Abdullahi|first=Mohamed Diriye|title=Culture and customs of Somalia|publisher=Greenwood|year=2001|pages=[https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00diri/page/170 170\u2013171]|isbn=978-0-313-31333-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00diri/page/170}}</ref> North African music has close ties with [[Middle Eastern music]] and utilizes similar melodic [[Mode (music)|modes]] (''maqamat'').<ref name=\"Hoppenstand\">{{cite book|last=Hoppenstand|first=Gary|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Popular Culture, Volume 4|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313332555|page=205}}</ref> It has a considerable range, from the [[Music of Egypt|music of ancient Egypt]] to the [[Berber music|Berber]] and the [[Tuareg music]] of the desert nomads.

Its popular contemporary genres include the [[Music of Algeria|Algerian]] [[Ra\u00ef]]. [[Music of Somalia|Somali music]] is typically [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]], using five [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] per [[octave]] in contrast to a [[Heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] (seven note) scale such as the [[major scale]].<ref name=\"Mdacacos\"/> In [[Music of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]], the music of the highlands uses a fundamental modal system called ''[[qenet]]'', of which there are four main modes: ''tezeta'', ''bati'', ''[[Ambassel scale|ambassel]]'', and ''anchihoy''.<ref name=Grove356>{{NewGrove2001|article=Ethiopia|last=Shelemay|first=Kay Kaufman|vol=viii|pages=356}}</ref> Three additional modes are variations on the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor.<ref name=\"Barihun\">[[Abatte Barihun]], liner notes of the album Ras Deshen, 200.</ref> Some songs take the name of their qenet, such as [[tizita]], a song of reminiscence.<ref name=Grove356 />\n\n==Languages==\n{{Main|Languages of Africa}}\nThe main ethnolinguistic divisions in Africa are [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] (North Africa, Horn of Africa), [[Niger\u2013Congo]] (including speakers from the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] branch) in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, [[Nilo-Saharan]] in parts of the [[Sahara]] and the [[Sahel]] and parts of [[Eastern Africa]], and [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] (indigenous minorities of [[Southern Africa]]).<ref>Greenberg, Joseph H.

Bloomington: Indiana University.</ref> The continent of Africa speaks hundreds of languages, and if dialects spoken by various ethnic groups are also included, the number is much higher. These languages and dialects do not have the same importance: some are spoken by only few hundred people, others are spoken by millions. Among the most prominent languages spoken are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]. Very few countries of Africa use any single language and for this reason, several official languages coexist, African and European.

It was  powered by two 890&nbsp;hp [[Bristol Perseus|Bristol Perseus XIIIC]] air-cooled radial engines driving three-bladed D.H hydromatic variable-pitch propellers.  Two pilots were seated side by side with a [[radio]] operator behind them in the cockpit, with the cabin accommodating 12\u201317 passengers.

It had oval cabin windows instead of rectangular ones, and seating for 22 soldiers.\n\nA proposed order for 40 was cancelled to leave de Havillands free to produce [[De Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]] trainers. The sole Hertfordshire crashed with the loss of 11 lives at Mill Hill, Hertfordshire on 23 October 1940, apparently due to jamming of the [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]].\n\n==Operational service==\n[[File:DH.95 Flamingo Redhill 1953.jpg|thumb|right|DH.95 Flamingo G-AFYH of [[British Air Transport]] at Redhill airfield, Surrey, in June 1953]]\n\nFollowing the success of the first test flights [[Jersey Airways]] ordered three 17-seat aircraft, and this was followed by orders from the Egyptian government and the Air Ministry. The Air Ministry aircraft were to be used by the Air Council and the [[King's Flight]].\n\nThe prototype, fitted with 12 passenger seats, was delivered to [[Jersey Airways]] in May 1939 for two months evaluation and became the first revenue-earning Flamingo. The first services carried mail only but in July a regular weekend passenger service was operated.\n\nIn October 1939 the prototype was bought by the Air Council, being delivered to [[No. 24 Squadron RAF]] where it operated until it was lost in an accident in October 1940. The second aircraft was to be the first for Guernsey and Jersey Airlines but it was impressed into military service and delivered to 24 Squadron, the other two on order were never built due to the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nThe King's Flight aircraft was to be used in the event of the royal family having to leave the country but in the end it was passed to 24 Squadron for communications and liaison duties. \n\nEarly in 1940 [[BOAC]] ordered eight aircraft to be powered by the Perseus XVI and originally intended as ten-seaters. The first [[BOAC]] aircraft was delivered to [[Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport|Whitchurch]] on 5 September 1940. The second BOAC aircraft was impressed by the Air Ministry and allocated for Admiralty use at [[RNAS Donibristle]]. To replace the impressed aircraft BOAC were later allotted the aircraft ordered by the Egyptian Government. After a period of training all the BOAC Flamingos were moved to Cairo to operate in the Middle East. The BOAC aircraft were named after English Kings and were named ''K-class'' by the airline.\n\nThe Flamingo was Winston Churchill's favorite short/medium range transport and he flew it to visit Reynaud and the French leadership as the front collapsed on May 16th 1940\n\nThe BOAC Flamingoes were not popular, and following three accidents \u2013 one of which was fatal \u2013 and with a lack of spares, the airline decided to withdraw the type. In 1943 the five airworthy aircraft were shipped back to the United Kingdom. They did not return to service and were scrapped in the early 1950s.\n\nMost of the RAF aircraft were withdrawn from use during the war and were slowly scrapped to provide spares for the remaining aircraft. The Admiralty aircraft was due to be withdrawn and scrapped but in August 1944 it [[Ground loop (aviation) |ground looped]] at [[RAF Gatwick|Gatwick]] and was abandoned. In 1946 the former Admiralty aircraft was bought by Southern Aircraft (Gatwick) and rebuilt using former BOAC spare parts. It flew again in 1947 and was delivered to British Air Transport at Redhill, gaining a Certificate of Airworthiness. It operated a number of charter flight until it was temporarily withdrawn from use in 1949.\n\nBritish Air Transport also arranged to restore three former BOAC aircraft, the scheme was abandoned although the aircraft were in an advanced stage of reconstruction. In 1952, British Air Transport restored the original former Admiralty aircraft which flew again on 27 May 1952.

Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the [[Christology|nature of Jesus]], the authority of [[apostolic succession]], [[ecclesiology]], [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]], and [[papal primacy]] may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations\u2014often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties\u2014are sometimes known as \"[[branches of Christianity]]\". These branches differ in many ways, especially through differences in practices and belief.\n\nIndividual [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]] vary widely in the degree to which they recognize one another. Several groups claim to be the direct and [[One true church|sole authentic successor]] of the church founded by [[Jesus Christ]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]]. Others, however, believe in denominationalism, where some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels, beliefs, and practices<!--from Denominationalism 3/22/15-->. Because of this concept, some Christian bodies reject the term \"denomination\" to describe themselves, to avoid implying equivalency with other churches or denominations.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, which has over 1.3 billion members<ref name=\"Annuario\">{{cite web|url=https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2019/03/06/190306b.html|title=Presentation of the Pontifical Yearbook 2019 and the Annuarium Statisticum Ecclesiae 2017|date=6 March 2019|publisher=[[Holy See Press Office]]|access-date=6 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307110120/https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2019/03/06/190306b.html|archive-date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\u2013slightly over half of all Christians worldwide\u2013does not view itself as a denomination, but as the original pre-denominational Church,<ref name=olsen1999>Olson, Roger E.

The Eastern Orthodox Church together with [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] constitute [[Eastern Christianity]]. There are smaller groups of [[Eastern Catholics]] which are in communion with the Bishop of Rome as well as [[Protestant Eastern Christianity|Protestant Eastern Christians]] that have adopted Protestant theology but have cultural and historical ties with other Eastern Christians. Eastern Christian denominations are represented mostly in [[Eastern Europe]], [[North Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[Horn of Africa|Northeast Africa]], and [[India]] (especially [[South India]]).\n\nChristians have various doctrines about the Church (the body of the faithful that they believe Jesus Christ established) and about how the divine church corresponds to Christian denominations. Both Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox hold that their own organizations faithfully represent the [[Four Marks of the Church|one holy catholic and apostolic Church]] to the exclusion of the other. Sixteenth-century Protestants separated from the Catholic Church because of [[Theology|theologies]] and [[Ritual|practices]] that they considered to be in violation of their own interpretation.

Protestantism includes many groups which do not share any ecclesiastical governance and have widely diverging beliefs and practices.\n\nChristianity has denominational families (or movements) and also has individual denominations (or communions). The difference between a denomination and a denominational family is sometimes unclear to outsiders. Some denominational families can be considered major branches.  Groups that are members of a branch, while sharing historical ties and similar doctrines, are not necessarily in [[communion (Christianity)|communion]] with one another.\n\nThere were some movements considered heresies by the [[History of Christianity|early Church]] which do not exist today and are not generally referred to as denominations. Examples include the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] (who had believed in an [[esotericism|esoteric]] [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] called [[gnosis]]), the [[Ebionite]]s (who denied the divinity of Jesus), and the [[Arianism|Arians]] (who subordinated the [[God the Son|Son]] to the [[God the Father|Father]] by denying the [[pre-existence of Christ]], thus placing [[Jesus]] as a created being), [[Bogumilism]] and [[Bosnian Church]]. The greatest divisions in Christianity today, however, are between the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and the various denominations formed during and after the [[Protestant Reformation]]. There also exists a number of [[non-Trinitarian]] groups. There also exist some non-traditional groups that the majority of other Christians view as [[apostasy|apostate]] or [[heresy|heretical]], and not as legitimate versions of Christianity.\n\nComparisons between denominational churches must be approached with caution. For example, in some churches, congregations are part of a larger church organization, while in other groups, each congregation is an independent [[autonomous entity|autonomous]] organization. This issue is further complicated by the existence of groups of congregations with a common heritage that are officially nondenominational and have no centralized authority or records, but which are identified as denominations by non-adherents. Study of such churches in denominational terms is therefore a more complex proposition.\n\nSome groups count membership based on adult believers and [[baptism|baptized]] children of believers, while others only count adult baptized believers. Others may count membership based on those adult believers who have formally affiliated themselves with the congregation. In addition, there may be political motives of advocates or opponents of a particular group to inflate or deflate membership numbers through [[propaganda]] or outright deception.\n\n===Denominationalism===\nDenominationalism is the belief that some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels, beliefs, and practices.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> The idea was first articulated by [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] within the [[Puritan]] movement. They argued that differences among Christians were inevitable, but that separation based on these differences was not necessarily [[schism (religion)|schism]]. Christians are obligated to practice their beliefs rather than remain within a church with which they disagree, but they must also recognize their imperfect knowledge and not condemn other Christians as [[apostate]] over unimportant matters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seminary.fresno.edu/resources/life-in-a-muddy-world-reflections-on-denominationalism |title=Life in a Muddy World: Reflections on Denominationalism |first=Bruce |last=Guenther |publisher=Fresno Pacific Biblical Seminary; first published in Fall/Winter 2008 edition of In Touch Magazine.

As of 2011, divisions are becoming less sharp, and there is increasing cooperation between denominations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[theology|Theological]] denominationalism ultimately denies reality to any apparent doctrinal differences among the \"denominations\", reducing all differences to mere matters ''de nomina'' (\"of names\").{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nA denomination in this sense is created when part of a church no longer feel they can accept the leadership of that church as a spiritual leadership due to a different view of doctrine or what they see as immoral behaviour, but the schism does not in any way reflect either group leaving the Church as a theoretical whole.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThis particular doctrine is rejected by [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodoxy]]. In these churches, it is not possible to have a separation over doctrinal or leadership issues, and any such attempts automatically are a type of [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. Some Protestant groups reject denominationalism as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Taxonomy===\n{{Christian denomination tree}}\n\n==Historical schisms and divisions==\n[[File:Major branches within Christianity kr.png|180px|thumb|\u3163left|Diagram of Non-denominational systems in Christianity]]\nChristianity has not been a monolithic faith since the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]] or [[Apostolic Age]], if ever, and today there exist a large variety of groups that share a common history and tradition within and without [[mainstream]] Christianity. Christianity is the largest religion in the world (making up approximately one-third of the population) and the various divisions have commonalities and differences in tradition, [[theology]], [[ecclesiology|church government]], doctrine, and language.\n\nThe largest [[schism]] or division in many classification schemes is between the families of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity]]. After these two larger families come distinct branches of Christianity. Most classification schemes list six (in order of size: [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the Church of the East, which was originally referred to as [[Nestorianism]] but in modern times is embodied by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]).\n\nUnlike Roman Catholicism, Protestantism is a general movement that has no universal governing authority. As such, diverse groups such as [[Adventism|Adventists]], [[Anabaptists]], [[Baptists]], [[Binitarianism|Binitarians]], [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismatics]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Evangelical Christianity|Evangelicals]], [[Holiness movement|Holiness churches]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed]], and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] (depending on one's classification scheme) are all a part of the same family but have distinct doctrinal variations within each group{{snd}}[[Lutherans]] see themselves not to be a part of the rest of what they call \"Reformed Protestantism\" due to radical differences in sacramental theology and historical approach to the Reformation itself (both Reformed and Lutherans see their reformation in the sixteenth century to be a 'reforming' of the Catholic Church, not a rejection of it entirely). From these come denominations, which in the West, have independence from the others in their doctrine.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]], due to their [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures, are not said to be made up of denominations, rather, they include kinds of regional councils and individual congregations and church bodies, which do not officially differ from one another in doctrine.\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{See also|History_of_Oriental_Orthodoxy#Chalcedonian_Schism}}\nThe initial differences between the East and West traditions stem from socio-cultural and ethno-linguistic divisions in and between the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]]s. Since the West (that is, Western Europe) spoke [[Latin]] as its ''[[lingua franca]]'' and the East (Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and northern Africa) largely used [[Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]] to transmit writings, theological developments were difficult to translate from one branch to the other. In the course of [[ecumenical council]]s (large gatherings of Christian leaders), some church bodies split from the larger family of Christianity. Many earlier [[heresy|heretical]] groups either died off for lack of followers or suppression by the early [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|proto-orthodox]] Church at large (such as [[Apollinarianism|Apollinarians]], [[Montanism|Montanists]], and [[Ebionites]]).\n\nThe first significant, lasting split in historic Christianity came from the [[Church of the East]], who left following the [[Christology|Christological]] controversy over [[Nestorianism]] in 431 (the Assyrians in 1994 released a common Christological statement with the [[Catholic Church]]). Today, the Assyrian and Catholic Church view this schism as largely linguistic, due to problems of translating very delicate and precise terminology from Latin to [[Aramaic]] and vice versa (see [[Council of Ephesus]]).\n\nFollowing the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, the next large split came with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] churches dividing themselves, with the dissenting churches becoming today's [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodox]]. The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], whose representatives were not able to attend the council did not accept new dogmas and now is also seen as an Oriental Orthodox church. In modern times, there have also been moves towards healing this split, with common Christological statements being made between [[Pope John Paul II]] and Syriac Patriarch [[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas]], as well as between representatives of both Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy.\n\nThere has been a claim that the [[Chalcedonian Definition|Chalcedonian Creed]] restored Nestorianism, however this is refuted by maintaining the following distinctions associated with the ''person'' of Christ: two hypostases, two natures (Nestorian); one hypostasis, one nature (Monophysite); one hypostasis, two natures (Orthodox/Catholic).<ref>Chapman, J. (1911). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10489b.htm Monophysites and Monophysitism.] in The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved June 4, 2009</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{main|East-West Schism}}\nIn Western Christianity, there were a handful of geographically isolated movements that preceded the spirit of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Cathars]] were a very strong movement in medieval southwestern France, but did not survive into modern times. In northern [[Italy]] and southeastern [[France]], [[Peter Waldo]] founded the [[Waldensians]] in the 12th century. This movement has largely been absorbed by modern-day Protestant groups. In [[Bohemia]], a movement in the early 15th century by [[Jan Hus]] called the [[Hussite]]s defied Catholic [[dogma]] and still exists to this day (alternately known as the [[Moravian Church]]).\n\nAlthough the church as a whole did not experience any major divisions for centuries afterward, the Eastern and Western groups drifted until the point where patriarchs from both families [[excommunication|excommunicated]] one another in about 1054 in what is known as the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]]. The political and theological reasons for the schism are complex, but one major controversy was the inclusion and acceptance in the West of the [[filioque clause]] into the [[Nicene Creed]], which the East viewed as erroneous. Another was the definition of [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|papal primacy]].\n\nBoth West and East agreed that the Patriarch of Rome was owed a \"primacy of honour\" by the other patriarchs (those of [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Constantinople]] and [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]), but the West also contended that this primacy extended to jurisdiction, a position rejected by the Eastern patriarchs. Various attempts at dialogue between the two groups would occur, but it was only in the 1960s, under Pope [[Paul VI]] and [[Patriarch Athenagoras]], that significant steps began to be made to mend the relationship between the two.\n\n[[File:Lutherstadt Wittenberg 09-2016 photo06.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Door of the ''Schlosskirche'' (castle church) in Wittenberg to which Luther is said to have nailed his [[95 Theses]] on 31st October 1517, sparking the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].]]\n\n===Protestant Reformation (16th century)===\n{{main|Protestant Reformation}}\n\nThe Protestant Reformation began with the posting of [[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]]'' in [[Saxony]] on October 31, 1517, written as a set of grievances to reform the pre-Reformation Western Church. [[Martin Luther (resources)|Luther's writings]], combined with the work of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] theologian [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and French theologian and politician [[John Calvin]] sought to reform existing problems in doctrine and practice. Due to the reactions of ecclesiastical office holders at the time of the reformers, these reformers separated from the Catholic Church, instigating a rift in [[Western Christianity]].\n\nIn [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England]] declared himself to be supreme head of the [[Church of England]] with the [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1531, founding the Church of England, repressing both Lutheran reformers and those loyal to the pope. [[Thomas Cranmer]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] introduced the Reformation, in a form compromising between the Calvinists and Lutherans.\n\n===Old and Liberal Catholic Churches (19th-20th centuries)===\n\nThe [[Old Catholic Church]] split from the [[Catholic Church]] in the 1870s because of the promulgation of the [[dogma]] of [[papal infallibility]] as promoted by the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1869\u20131870. The term 'Old Catholic' was first used in 1853 to describe the members of the See of Utrecht that were not under Papal authority. The Old Catholic movement grew in America but has not maintained ties with Utrecht, although talks are under way between independent Old Catholic bishops and Utrecht.\n\nThe [[Liberal Catholic Church]] started in 1916 via an Old Catholic bishop in London, bishop Matthew, who consecrated bishop James Wedgwood to the Episcopacy. This stream has in its relatively short existence known many splits, which operate worldwide under several names.\n\n===Eastern Christianity===\nIn the Eastern world, the largest body of believers in modern times is the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], sometimes imprecisely called \"Greek Orthodox\" because from the time of Christ through the Byzantine empire, Greek was its common language. However, the term \"[[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]]\" actually refers to only one portion of the entire Eastern Orthodox Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church believes itself to be the continuation of the original Christian Church established by [[Jesus Christ]], and the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. The Orthodox and Catholics have been separated since the 11th century, following the [[East\u2013West Schism]], with each of them claiming to represent the original pre-schism Church.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox consider themselves to be spiritually one body, which is administratively grouped into several [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] jurisdictions (also commonly referred to as \"churches\", despite being parts of one Church). They do not recognize any single bishop as universal church leader, but rather each bishop governs only his own [[diocese]]. The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] is known as the Ecumenical Patriarch, and holds the title \"[[primus inter pares|first among equals]]\", meaning only that if a great council is called, the patriarch sits as president of the council. He has no more power than any other bishop. Currently, the largest [[synod]] with the most members is the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Others include the ancient Patriarchates of [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antioch]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian]] and [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian]] Orthodox churches, and several smaller ones.\n[[File:Church of Saint John the Arab.jpg|thumb|225px|A 6th century Nestorian church, St. John the Arab, in the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] village of [[Andac|Geramon]].]]\nThe second largest Eastern Christian communion is [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodoxy]], which is organized in a similar manner, with six national autocephalous groups and two autonomous bodies, although there are greater internal differences than among the Eastern Orthodox (especially in the diversity of [[rite]]s being used). The six autocephalous Oriental Orthodox churches are the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] (Egyptian), [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]], [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenian]], [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church|Malankara]] (Indian), [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Eritrean]] Orthodox churches. In the Aramaic-speaking areas of the [[Middle East]], the Syriac Orthodox Church has long been dominant. Although the region of modern-day [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]] has had a strong body of believers since the infancy of Christianity, these regions only gained autocephaly in 1963 and 1994 respectively. The Oriental Orthodox are distinguished from the Eastern Orthodox by doctrinal differences concerning the union of human and divine natures in the person of Jesus Christ, and the two communions separated as a consequence of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in the year 451, although there have been recent moves towards reconciliation. Since these groups are relatively obscure in the West, literature on them has sometimes included the [[Church of the East]], which, like the Oriental Orthodox, originated in the 1st century A.D., but has not been in communion with them since before the [[Council of Ephesus]] of 431.\n\nLargely [[aniconic]], the Church of the East represents a third Eastern Christian tradition in its own right. In recent centuries, it has split into three Churches. The largest (since the early 20th century) is the [[Baghdad]]-based [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] formed from groups that entered communion with Rome at different times, beginning in 1552. The second-largest is what since 1976<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&dq=Assyrian+officially+1976&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOqPzw45LeAhWoDcAKHSd0BrMQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&q=Assyrian%20officially%201976&f=false Wilhelm Baum, Dietmar W. Winkler (editors), ''The Church of the East: A Concise History'' (Routledge 2003), p. 4]</ref> is officially called the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and which from 1933 to 2015 was headquartered first in [[Cyprus]] and then in the [[United States]], but whose present Catholicos-Patriarch, [[Gewargis III]], elected in 2015, lives in [[Erbil]], [[Iraq]]. The third is the [[Ancient Church of the East]], distinct since 1964 and headed by [[Addai II Giwargis]], resident in Baghdad.\n\nThere are also the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], most of which are counterparts of those listed above, sharing with them the same theological and liturgical traditions, but differing from them in that they recognize the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]] as the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|universal head of the Church]]. They are fully part of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic communion]], on the same level juridically as the [[Latin Church]]. Most of their members do not describe themselves as \"[[Roman Catholic (term)|''Roman'' Catholics]]\", a term they associate with membership of the Latin Church, and speak of themselves in relation to whichever Church they belong to: [[Maronite Church|Maronites]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkites]], [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholics]], [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholics]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholics]], etc.<ref>[http://www.crisismagazine.com/2011/we-are-non-roman-catholics Robert Spencer, \"We are Non-Roman Catholics\" in ''Crisis Magazine'', 22 November 2011]</ref>\n\nAnd finally the smallest Eastern Christian group founded in early 20th century is [[Byzantine Rite Lutheranism]] where accept Byzantine Rite as Church's liturgy while retaining their Lutheran traditions like [[Ukrainian Lutheran Church]]. It is considered part of [[Reformed Eastern Christianity]].\n\n===Western Christianity===\n{{Denominations of Christianity}}\n\nThe [[Latin Church|Latin portion]] of the [[Catholic Church]], along with [[Anglicanism]] and [[Protestantism]], comprise the three major divisions of [[Christianity]] in the Western world. Catholics do not describe themselves as a denomination but rather as the original Church; which all other branches broke off from in [[schism (religious)|schism]]. The [[Baptist]], [[Methodism|Methodist]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches are generally considered to be Protestant denominations, although strictly speaking, of these three, only the Lutherans took part in the official [[Protestation at Speyer]] after the decree of the [[Second Diet of Speyer]] mandated the burning of Luther's works and the end of the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nAnglicanism was generally classified as Protestant, but since the \"Tractarian\" or [[Oxford Movement]] of the 19th century, led by [[John Henry Newman]], Anglican writers emphasize a more [[Catholic (term)|catholic]] understanding of the church and characterize it as more properly understood as its own tradition\u2014a ''via media'' (\"middle way\"), ''both'' Protestant and Catholic. The American province of the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Episcopal Church USA]], describes itself as a modern ''via media'' church in this tradition. A case is sometimes also made to regard Lutheranism in a similar way, considering the catholic character of its foundational documents (the [[Augsburg Confession]] and other documents contained in the [[Book of Concord]]) and its existence prior to the Anglican, Anabaptist, and [[Reformed]] churches, from which nearly all other Protestant denominations derive.\n\nOne central tenet of Catholicism (which is a common point between Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some other Churches), is its practice of [[apostolic succession]]. \"Apostle\" means \"one who is sent out\". Jesus commissioned the first [[twelve apostles]] (see [[Biblical Figures]] for the list of the Twelve), and they, in turn laid hands on subsequent church leaders to ordain (commission) them for ministry. In this manner, Catholics and Anglicans trace their ordained ministers all the way back to the original Twelve.\n\nCatholics believe that the [[Pope]] has authority which can be traced directly to the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]] whom they hold to be the original head of and first Pope of the [[Christian Church|Church]]. There are smaller churches, such as the [[Old Catholic Church]] which rejected the definition of [[Papal Infallibility]] at the [[First Vatican Council]], and [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] who believe that Anglicanism is a continuation of historical [[Catholicism]] and who incorporate many Catholic beliefs and practices. The Catholic Church refers to itself simply by the terms ''Catholic'' and ''Catholicism'' (which mean universal).\n\nSometimes, Catholics, based on a strict interpretation of ''[[extra ecclesiam nulla salus]]'' (\"Outside the Church, there is no salvation\"), rejected any notion those outside its communion could be regarded as part of any true Catholic Christian faith, an attitude rejected by the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962{{ndash}}1965).<ref name=\"UnitatisRed\">\u00abIt remains true that all who have been justified by faith in Baptism are members of Christ's body, and have a right to be called Christian, and so are correctly accepted as brothers by the children of the Catholic Church.\u00bb [https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html Second Vatican Council, Decree on Ecumenism ''Unitatis Redintegratio'', n.3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306113628/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html |date=March 6, 2013 }}</ref> Catholicism has a hierarchical structure in which supreme authority for matters of faith and practice are the exclusive domain of the Pope, who sits on the Throne of Peter, and the bishops when acting in union with him. Most Catholics are unaware of the existence of [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholicism]] which represents a relatively recent split from the Catholic Church and is particularly vocal in rejecting their use of the term ''Catholic''.\n\nEach Protestant movement has developed freely, and many have split over theological issues. For instance, a number of movements grew out of spiritual [[Revivalism|revivals]], such as [[Pentecostalism]]. Doctrinal issues and matters of [[conscience]] have also divided Protestants. The [[Anabaptist]] tradition, made up of the [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]], rejected the Roman Catholic and Lutheran doctrines of [[pedobaptism|infant baptism]]; this tradition is also noted for its belief in [[pacifism]]. Still others formed out of administrative issues; [[Methodism]] branched off as its own group of denominations when the [[American Revolutionary War]] complicated the movement's ability to ordain ministers (it had begun as a movement within the Church of England). In Methodism's case, it has undergone a number of administrative schisms and mergers with other denominations (especially those associated with the [[holiness movement]] in the 20th century).\n\nMany churches with roots in [[Restorationism]] reject being identified as Protestant or even as a denomination at all, as they use only the Bible and not creeds, and model the church after what they feel is the first-century church found in scripture; the [[Churches of Christ]] are one example; [[African Initiated Church]]es, like [[Kimbanguism]], mostly fall within Protestantism, with varying degrees of syncretism. The measure of mutual acceptance between the denominations and movements varies, but is growing largely due to the [[ecumenism|ecumenical movement]] in the 20th century and overarching Christian bodies such as the [[World Council of Churches]].\n\n===Christians with Jewish roots===\n{{Main|Jewish Christian|Messianic Judaism|Hebrew Christian movement}}\n[[Messianic Jews]] maintain a Jewish identity while accepting Jesus as the [[Messiah]] and the [[New Testament]] as authoritative. After the founding of the church, the [[Jewish Christian|disciples of Jesus]] generally retained their ethnic origins while accepting the [[Gospel]] message. The [[Council of Jerusalem|first church council was called in Jerusalem]] to address just this issue, and the deciding opinion was written by [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], the first bishop of Jerusalem and a pivotal figure in the Christian movement. The history of Messianic Judaism includes many movements and groups and defies any simple classification scheme.\n\nThe 19th century saw at least 250,000 Jews convert to Christianity according to existing records of various societies.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Stanley N | last1 = Gundry | first2 = Louis | last2 = Goldberg | title = How Jewish is Christianity?: 2 views on the Messianic movement | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sYfcuBdLqyEC&pg=PA24 | publisher = Google | format = Books | page = 24}}.</ref> Data from the [[Pew Research Center]] has it that, as of 2013, about 1.6 million adult [[American Jews]] identify themselves as [[Christians]], most as [[Protestant]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/02/how-many-jews-are-there-in-the-united-states/|title=How many Jews are there in the United States?|work=Pew Research Center}}</ref><ref name=\"pew: portrait\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/chapter-1-population-estimates/|title=A PORTRAIT OF JEWISH AMERICANS: Chapter 1: Population Estimates|work=Pew Research Center}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/.premium-1.549713|title=American-Jewish Population Rises to 6.8 Million|work=haaretz}}</ref> According to the same data, most of the Jews who identify themselves as some sort of Christian (1.6 million) were raised as Jews or are Jews by ancestry.<ref name=\"pew: portrait\" />\n\n==Modern history==\n\n===Quakers===\nSome denominations which arose alongside the Western Christian tradition consider themselves Christian, but neither Catholic nor wholly Protestant, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). Quakerism began as an evangelical Christian movement in 17th century [[England]], eschewing priests and all formal Anglican or [[Catholic sacraments]] in their worship, including many of those practices that remained among the stridently Protestant [[Puritan]]s such as baptism with water. They were known in America for helping with the Underground Railroad, and like the Mennonites, Quakers traditionally refrain from participation in war.\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n{{Main|Latter Day Saint movement|Mormonism}}\n{{See also|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|Mormonism and Christianity}}\nMost Latter Day Saint denominations are derived from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)]] established by [[Joseph Smith]] in 1830. The largest worldwide denomination is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], often referred to as [[Mormonism]]. Various considerably smaller sects broke from this movement after its relocation to the Rocky Mountains in the mid-1800s. Several of these broke away over the abandonment of practicing [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]] after the [[1890 Manifesto]]. Most of the \"Prairie Saint\" denominations (see below) were established after [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]] by the remnants of the Latter Day Saints who did not go west with [[Brigham Young]]. Many of these opposed some of the 1840s theological developments in favor of 1830s theological understandings and practices. Other denominations are defined by either a belief in Joseph Smith as a [[prophet]] or acceptance of the [[Book of Mormon]] as [[religious text|scripture]]. [[Mormons]] generally consider themselves to be [[Restorationism|restorationist]], believing that Smith, as [[prophet, seer, and revelator]], restored the original and true Church of Christ to the earth. Some Latter Day Saint denominations are regarded by other Christians as being [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] or even non-Christian, but the Latter Day Saints are predominantly in disagreement with these claims. Mormons see themselves as believing in a [[God in Mormonism|Godhead]] comprising the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost as separate personages united in purpose. Mormons regard traditional definitions of the [[Trinity]] as aberrations of true doctrine and emblematic of the [[Great Apostasy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Articles of Faith, no. 1|url=http://mormon.org/articles-of-faith|access-date=2014-01-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531162806/http://mormon.org/articles-of-faith|archive-date=2013-05-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> but they do not accept certain trinitarian definitions in the [[List of Christian creeds|post-apostolic creeds]], such as the [[Athanasian Creed]].\n\n===Second Great Awakening===\n{{Main|Second Great Awakening|Restorationism|Restoration Movement}}\nThe Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement began on the American frontier during the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1790\u20131870) of the early 19th century.

The second began in western Pennsylvania and Virginia (now West Virginia) and was led by [[Thomas Campbell (clergyman)|Thomas Campbell]] and his son, [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]]; they used the name \"[[Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement)|Disciples of Christ]]\". Both groups sought to restore the whole Christian church on the pattern set forth in the [[New Testament]], and both believed that [[creed]]s kept Christianity divided. In 1832 they joined in fellowship with a handshake.\n\nAmong other things, they were united in the belief that [[Jesus]] is the Christ, the [[Son of God]]; that Christians should celebrate the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|first day of each week]]; and that [[Believer's baptism|baptism of adult believers]] by [[Immersion baptism|immersion in water]] is a necessary condition for [[salvation]]. Because the founders wanted to abandon all denominational labels, they used the biblical names for the followers of Jesus.<ref name=\"McAlister & Tucker, 1975\">McAlister, Lester G. and Tucker, William E.

There are three main branches in the US: the [[Churches of Christ]], the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]], and the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]. Other U.S.-based groups affiliated with the movement are the [[International Churches of Christ]] and the [[International Christian Churches]]. Non-U.S. groups include the [[Churches of Christ in Australia]], the [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]], the [[Churches of Christ in Europe]]. The [[Plymouth Brethren]] are a similar though historically unrelated group which originated in the United Kingdom. Some churches, such as [[Churches of Christ]] or the [[Plymouth Brethren]] reject formal ties with other churches within the movement.\n\nOther Christian groups originating during the Second Great Awakening including the [[Millerites|Adventist movement]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Albin |first1=Barry |title=A Spiritual History of the Western Tradition |page=124}}</ref> the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Van Voorst, Robert E.|title=RELG: World (with Religion CourseMate with eBook Printed Access Card)|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=288|year=2012|isbn=978-1-1117-2620-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvNWxEEaf50C&pg=PT303}}</ref> and [[Christian Science]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eddy |first1=Mary Baker |title=Manual of the Mother Church |publisher=CSPS |page=17 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18039}}</ref> founded within fifty years of one another, all consider themselves to be restorative of primitive Christianity and the early church.

Their common denominator is that they sought God in \"Spirit and Truth\", ([[Gospel of John]] 4:24) rather than in the Church of official Orthodoxy or ancient rites of [[Old Believers]]. Rejecting the official church, they considered their religious organization as a homogeneous community, without division into laymen and clergy.\n\nIn the 1830s, Ivan Grigorev Kanygin founded religious communities with communal practices in the [[Novouzensk]] region. They called themselves Communists or Methodists, but from the 1870s became known as \"Mormons\", by comparison with the contemporaneous American movement. An unrelated community known as \"Samara Mormons\" developed near the [[Volga]] city of [[Samara, Russia|Samara]]. They avoided alcohol, tobacco, and swearing, cooperated in commercial enterprises, and governed themselves by \"apostles\" and \"prophets\".\n\nA more recent charismatic movement in Russia is the \"[[Vissarion|Church of the Last Testament]]\", which established a substantial settlement in the Siberian Taiga in the 1990s.\n\n===Iglesia ni Cristo===\nDue to a number of similarities, some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writers describe the doctrines of the Philippines originating [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] as restorationist in outlook and theme.<ref name=annharper>{{cite journal|title=The Iglesia ni Cristo and Evangelical Christianity|journal=Journal of Asian Mission|year=2001|first=Ann C.|last=Harper|volume=3|issue=1|pages=101\u2013119|id=|url=http://www.apologeticsindex.org/docs/iglesia_ni_cristo_and_evangelical_christianity.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-11-05}}</ref> INC, however, does not consider itself to be part of the [[Restoration Movement]].

These churches share a [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] predisposition and understanding of the [[Bible]] and were strongly influenced by the [[Transcendentalist]] movement\u2014particularly the work of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]. Another antecedent of this movement was [[Swedenborgianism]], founded in 1787 on the writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who claimed to have received a new revelation from Jesus Christ through continuous heavenly visions which he experienced over a period of at least twenty-five years.<ref>William James, [http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JamVari.sgm&images=images/modeg&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=parsed&tag=public&part=all \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. pp.92-93.

It was founded in 1922 in Switzerland by the Lutheran theologian and minister Friedrich Rittlemeyer, inspired by [[Rudolf Steiner]], the Austrian philosopher and founder of [[anthroposophy]]. Christian Community congregations exist as financially independent groups with regional and international administrative bodies overseeing their work. There are approximately 350 worldwide. The international headquarters are in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe Christian Community does not require its members to conform to any specific teaching or behaviour.<ref>Tom Ravetz: ''Free From Dogma. Theological Reflections in The Christian Community.'' Edinburgh 2009\n</ref> Seven sacraments are celebrated within the Community: the [[Eucharist]], generally called the ''Act of Consecration of Man'', and six other sacraments: [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], [[Marriage]], The Last [[Anointing]], Sacramental Consultation (replacing [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), and [[Ordination]].<ref>Evelyn Francis Capel and Tom Ravetz, ''Seven Sacraments in the Christian Community'', Floris Books, 1999</ref>\n\n=== Way Followers Christian Institution ===\nA Christian denomination founded in 2016 by Arthur David Beaman and approved as a tax-exempt church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/81-1380942|title=Guidestar|last=|first=|date=|website=www.guidestar.org|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref> It classifies itself as a contemporary version of the [[Ebionites]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestabor.com/ebionites-nazarenes-tracking-the-original-followers-of-jesus/|title=Ebionites & Nazarenes: Tracking the Original Followers of Jesus|date=2015-12-30|website=TaborBlog|language=en|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref> The original Jewish Christian Church in Jerusalem, headed by James the Just, was Ebionite. Members of the [[Way Followers Christian Institution]] (WFCI) follow the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. They are not strict observers of the Torah. Rather, they interpret the Torah in a contemporary context, such as interpreting the dietary laws, [[Kashrut]], as being God's way of keeping the Israelites from eating unhealthy food in an age where disease was not understood as it is today. They also use contemporary relevant sections of the Didache in their religious ethics and services.\n\nContained within the WFCI is a religious order, the Society of James the Just (SJJ).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamesthejustsociety.org|title=jamesthejustsociety.org|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2019|website=Society of James the Just|access-date=}}</ref> The SJJ also serves as a charitable ministry within the WFCI, providing services for the poor.\n\n===Other movements===\nProtestant denominations have shown a strong tendency towards diversification and fragmentation, giving rise to numerous churches and movements, especially in Anglo-American religious history, where the process is cast in terms of a series of \"[[Great Awakening]]s\".\nThe most recent wave of diversification, known as the [[Fourth Great Awakening]] took place during the 1960s to 1980s and resulted in phenomena such as the [[Charismatic Movement]], the [[Jesus movement]], and a great number of [[Parachurch organization]]s based in [[Evangelicalism]].\n\nMany independent churches and movements considered themselves to be [[Nondenominational|non-denominational]], but may vary greatly in doctrine. Many of these, like the [[Local churches (affiliation)|local churches]] movement, reflect the core teachings of traditional Christianity. Others however, such as [[The Way International]], have been denounced as cults by the [[Christian anti-cult movement]].\n\nTwo movements, which are entirely unrelated in their founding, but share a common element of an additional Messiah (or incarnation of Christ) are the [[Unification Church]] and the [[Rastafari movement]]. These movements fall outside of traditional [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] of Christian groups, though both cite the Christian Bible as a basis for their beliefs.\n\n[[Syncretism]] of Christian beliefs with local and tribal religions is a phenomenon that occurs throughout the world. An example of this is the [[Native American Church]]. The ceremonies of this group are strongly tied to the use of [[peyote]]. (Parallels may be drawn here with the Rastafari [[Entheogen|spiritual use]] of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].) While traditions vary from tribe to tribe, they often include a belief in Jesus as a Native American cultural hero, an intercessor for man, or a spiritual guardian; belief in the Bible; and an association of Jesus with peyote.\n\nThere are also some Christians that reject organized religion altogether. Some [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] - often those of a Protestant background - believe that the [[Ministry of Jesus|original teachings of Jesus]] were corrupted by Roman statism (compare [[Early Christianity]] and [[State church of the Roman Empire]]), and that earthly authority such as government, or indeed the established Church, do not and should not have power over them. Following \"[[Ethic of reciprocity|The Golden Rule]]\", many oppose the use of physical force in any circumstance, and advocate [[nonviolence]].

The [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], meaning the large majority, all self-describe as [[Church (congregation)|church]]es, whereas many [[List of the largest Protestant denominations|Protestant denominations]] self-describe as congregations or [[Communion (Christian)|fellowship]]s. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the [[Christology|nature of Jesus]], the authority of [[apostolic succession]], [[ecclesiology]], [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]], and [[papal primacy]] may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations\u2014often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties\u2014are sometimes known as \"[[branches of Christianity]]\". These branches differ in many ways, especially through differences in practices and belief.\n\nIndividual [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]] vary widely in the degree to which they recognize one another. Several groups claim to be the direct and [[One true church|sole authentic successor]] of the church founded by [[Jesus Christ]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]]. Others, however, believe in denominationalism, where some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels, beliefs, and practices<!--from Denominationalism 3/22/15-->. Because of this concept, some Christian bodies reject the term \"denomination\" to describe themselves, to avoid implying equivalency with other churches or denominations.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, which has over 1.3 billion members<ref name=\"Annuario\">{{cite web|url=https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2019/03/06/190306b.html|title=Presentation of the Pontifical Yearbook 2019 and the Annuarium Statisticum Ecclesiae 2017|date=6 March 2019|publisher=[[Holy See Press Office]]|access-date=6 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307110120/https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2019/03/06/190306b.html|archive-date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\u2013slightly over half of all Christians worldwide\u2013does not view itself as a denomination, but as the original pre-denominational Church,<ref name=olsen1999>Olson, Roger E.

The Eastern Orthodox Church together with [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] constitute [[Eastern Christianity]]. There are smaller groups of [[Eastern Catholics]] which are in communion with the Bishop of Rome as well as [[Protestant Eastern Christianity|Protestant Eastern Christians]] that have adopted Protestant theology but have cultural and historical ties with other Eastern Christians. Eastern Christian denominations are represented mostly in [[Eastern Europe]], [[North Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[Horn of Africa|Northeast Africa]], and [[India]] (especially [[South India]]).\n\nChristians have various doctrines about the Church (the body of the faithful that they believe Jesus Christ established) and about how the divine church corresponds to Christian denominations. Both Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox hold that their own organizations faithfully represent the [[Four Marks of the Church|one holy catholic and apostolic Church]] to the exclusion of the other. Sixteenth-century Protestants separated from the Catholic Church because of [[Theology|theologies]] and [[Ritual|practices]] that they considered to be in violation of their own interpretation.

Such supposed founders were referred to as [[heresiarch]]s. This was done even when the party thus labeled viewed itself as belonging to the one true church. This allowed the Catholic party to claim that the other church was founded by the founder, while the Catholic church was founded by Christ. This was done intentionally in order to \"produce the appearance of the fragmentation within Christianity\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=juQ9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22framed+to+produce+the+appearance+of+fragmentation+within+Christianity%22&source=bl&ots=Gd_MFTtuPx&sig=ACfU3U2Yi5QXGWDD8Sgriulgs7XB4wD6yg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijwIyW6KrhAhUCWa0KHUAVAZMQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22framed%20to%20produce%20the%20appearance%20of%20fragmentation%20within%20Christianity%22&f=false Making Christians: Clement of Alexandria and the Rhetoric of Legitimacy] by Denise Kimber Buell, 1999</ref>\u2013a problem which the Catholic side would then attempt to remedy on its own terms.\n\nAlthough Catholics reject [[branch theory]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] used the \"two lungs\" concept to relate Catholicism with Eastern Orthodoxy.<ref>[http://www.osservatoreromano.va/en/news/europe-breathes-with-both-lungs Modern culture runs risk of amnesia], from a speech given May 20th, 2010</ref>\n\n==Major branches==\n\n{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[Christianity]] can be taxonomically divided into five main groups: the [[Church of the East]], [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodoxy]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], and [[Protestantism]]. Protestantism includes many groups which do not share any ecclesiastical governance and have widely diverging beliefs and practices.\n\nChristianity has denominational families (or movements) and also has individual denominations (or communions). The difference between a denomination and a denominational family is sometimes unclear to outsiders. Some denominational families can be considered major branches.  Groups that are members of a branch, while sharing historical ties and similar doctrines, are not necessarily in [[communion (Christianity)|communion]] with one another.\n\nThere were some movements considered heresies by the [[History of Christianity|early Church]] which do not exist today and are not generally referred to as denominations. Examples include the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] (who had believed in an [[esotericism|esoteric]] [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] called [[gnosis]]), the [[Ebionite]]s (who denied the divinity of Jesus), and the [[Arianism|Arians]] (who subordinated the [[God the Son|Son]] to the [[God the Father|Father]] by denying the [[pre-existence of Christ]], thus placing [[Jesus]] as a created being), [[Bogumilism]] and [[Bosnian Church]]. The greatest divisions in Christianity today, however, are between the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and the various denominations formed during and after the [[Protestant Reformation]]. There also exists a number of [[non-Trinitarian]] groups. There also exist some non-traditional groups that the majority of other Christians view as [[apostasy|apostate]] or [[heresy|heretical]], and not as legitimate versions of Christianity.\n\nComparisons between denominational churches must be approached with caution. For example, in some churches, congregations are part of a larger church organization, while in other groups, each congregation is an independent [[autonomous entity|autonomous]] organization. This issue is further complicated by the existence of groups of congregations with a common heritage that are officially nondenominational and have no centralized authority or records, but which are identified as denominations by non-adherents. Study of such churches in denominational terms is therefore a more complex proposition.\n\nSome groups count membership based on adult believers and [[baptism|baptized]] children of believers, while others only count adult baptized believers. Others may count membership based on those adult believers who have formally affiliated themselves with the congregation. In addition, there may be political motives of advocates or opponents of a particular group to inflate or deflate membership numbers through [[propaganda]] or outright deception.\n\n===Denominationalism===\nDenominationalism is the belief that some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels, beliefs, and practices.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> The idea was first articulated by [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] within the [[Puritan]] movement. They argued that differences among Christians were inevitable, but that separation based on these differences was not necessarily [[schism (religion)|schism]]. Christians are obligated to practice their beliefs rather than remain within a church with which they disagree, but they must also recognize their imperfect knowledge and not condemn other Christians as [[apostate]] over unimportant matters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seminary.fresno.edu/resources/life-in-a-muddy-world-reflections-on-denominationalism |title=Life in a Muddy World: Reflections on Denominationalism |first=Bruce |last=Guenther |publisher=Fresno Pacific Biblical Seminary; first published in Fall/Winter 2008 edition of In Touch Magazine.

As of 2011, divisions are becoming less sharp, and there is increasing cooperation between denominations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[theology|Theological]] denominationalism ultimately denies reality to any apparent doctrinal differences among the \"denominations\", reducing all differences to mere matters ''de nomina'' (\"of names\").{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nA denomination in this sense is created when part of a church no longer feel they can accept the leadership of that church as a spiritual leadership due to a different view of doctrine or what they see as immoral behaviour, but the schism does not in any way reflect either group leaving the Church as a theoretical whole.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThis particular doctrine is rejected by [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodoxy]]. In these churches, it is not possible to have a separation over doctrinal or leadership issues, and any such attempts automatically are a type of [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. Some Protestant groups reject denominationalism as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Taxonomy===\n{{Christian denomination tree}}\n\n==Historical schisms and divisions==\n[[File:Major branches within Christianity kr.png|180px|thumb|\u3163left|Diagram of Non-denominational systems in Christianity]]\nChristianity has not been a monolithic faith since the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]] or [[Apostolic Age]], if ever, and today there exist a large variety of groups that share a common history and tradition within and without [[mainstream]] Christianity. Christianity is the largest religion in the world (making up approximately one-third of the population) and the various divisions have commonalities and differences in tradition, [[theology]], [[ecclesiology|church government]], doctrine, and language.\n\nThe largest [[schism]] or division in many classification schemes is between the families of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity]]. After these two larger families come distinct branches of Christianity. Most classification schemes list six (in order of size: [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the Church of the East, which was originally referred to as [[Nestorianism]] but in modern times is embodied by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]).\n\nUnlike Roman Catholicism, Protestantism is a general movement that has no universal governing authority. As such, diverse groups such as [[Adventism|Adventists]], [[Anabaptists]], [[Baptists]], [[Binitarianism|Binitarians]], [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismatics]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Evangelical Christianity|Evangelicals]], [[Holiness movement|Holiness churches]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed]], and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] (depending on one's classification scheme) are all a part of the same family but have distinct doctrinal variations within each group{{snd}}[[Lutherans]] see themselves not to be a part of the rest of what they call \"Reformed Protestantism\" due to radical differences in sacramental theology and historical approach to the Reformation itself (both Reformed and Lutherans see their reformation in the sixteenth century to be a 'reforming' of the Catholic Church, not a rejection of it entirely). From these come denominations, which in the West, have independence from the others in their doctrine.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]], due to their [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures, are not said to be made up of denominations, rather, they include kinds of regional councils and individual congregations and church bodies, which do not officially differ from one another in doctrine.\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{See also|History_of_Oriental_Orthodoxy#Chalcedonian_Schism}}\nThe initial differences between the East and West traditions stem from socio-cultural and ethno-linguistic divisions in and between the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]]s. Since the West (that is, Western Europe) spoke [[Latin]] as its ''[[lingua franca]]'' and the East (Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and northern Africa) largely used [[Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]] to transmit writings, theological developments were difficult to translate from one branch to the other. In the course of [[ecumenical council]]s (large gatherings of Christian leaders), some church bodies split from the larger family of Christianity. Many earlier [[heresy|heretical]] groups either died off for lack of followers or suppression by the early [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|proto-orthodox]] Church at large (such as [[Apollinarianism|Apollinarians]], [[Montanism|Montanists]], and [[Ebionites]]).\n\nThe first significant, lasting split in historic Christianity came from the [[Church of the East]], who left following the [[Christology|Christological]] controversy over [[Nestorianism]] in 431 (the Assyrians in 1994 released a common Christological statement with the [[Catholic Church]]). Today, the Assyrian and Catholic Church view this schism as largely linguistic, due to problems of translating very delicate and precise terminology from Latin to [[Aramaic]] and vice versa (see [[Council of Ephesus]]).\n\nFollowing the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, the next large split came with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] churches dividing themselves, with the dissenting churches becoming today's [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodox]]. The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], whose representatives were not able to attend the council did not accept new dogmas and now is also seen as an Oriental Orthodox church. In modern times, there have also been moves towards healing this split, with common Christological statements being made between [[Pope John Paul II]] and Syriac Patriarch [[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas]], as well as between representatives of both Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy.\n\nThere has been a claim that the [[Chalcedonian Definition|Chalcedonian Creed]] restored Nestorianism, however this is refuted by maintaining the following distinctions associated with the ''person'' of Christ: two hypostases, two natures (Nestorian); one hypostasis, one nature (Monophysite); one hypostasis, two natures (Orthodox/Catholic).<ref>Chapman, J. (1911). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10489b.htm Monophysites and Monophysitism.] in The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved June 4, 2009</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{main|East-West Schism}}\nIn Western Christianity, there were a handful of geographically isolated movements that preceded the spirit of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Cathars]] were a very strong movement in medieval southwestern France, but did not survive into modern times. In northern [[Italy]] and southeastern [[France]], [[Peter Waldo]] founded the [[Waldensians]] in the 12th century. This movement has largely been absorbed by modern-day Protestant groups. In [[Bohemia]], a movement in the early 15th century by [[Jan Hus]] called the [[Hussite]]s defied Catholic [[dogma]] and still exists to this day (alternately known as the [[Moravian Church]]).\n\nAlthough the church as a whole did not experience any major divisions for centuries afterward, the Eastern and Western groups drifted until the point where patriarchs from both families [[excommunication|excommunicated]] one another in about 1054 in what is known as the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]]. The political and theological reasons for the schism are complex, but one major controversy was the inclusion and acceptance in the West of the [[filioque clause]] into the [[Nicene Creed]], which the East viewed as erroneous. Another was the definition of [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|papal primacy]].\n\nBoth West and East agreed that the Patriarch of Rome was owed a \"primacy of honour\" by the other patriarchs (those of [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Constantinople]] and [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]), but the West also contended that this primacy extended to jurisdiction, a position rejected by the Eastern patriarchs. Various attempts at dialogue between the two groups would occur, but it was only in the 1960s, under Pope [[Paul VI]] and [[Patriarch Athenagoras]], that significant steps began to be made to mend the relationship between the two.\n\n[[File:Lutherstadt Wittenberg 09-2016 photo06.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Door of the ''Schlosskirche'' (castle church) in Wittenberg to which Luther is said to have nailed his [[95 Theses]] on 31st October 1517, sparking the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].]]\n\n===Protestant Reformation (16th century)===\n{{main|Protestant Reformation}}\n\nThe Protestant Reformation began with the posting of [[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]]'' in [[Saxony]] on October 31, 1517, written as a set of grievances to reform the pre-Reformation Western Church. [[Martin Luther (resources)|Luther's writings]], combined with the work of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] theologian [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and French theologian and politician [[John Calvin]] sought to reform existing problems in doctrine and practice. Due to the reactions of ecclesiastical office holders at the time of the reformers, these reformers separated from the Catholic Church, instigating a rift in [[Western Christianity]].\n\nIn [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England]] declared himself to be supreme head of the [[Church of England]] with the [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1531, founding the Church of England, repressing both Lutheran reformers and those loyal to the pope. [[Thomas Cranmer]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] introduced the Reformation, in a form compromising between the Calvinists and Lutherans.\n\n===Old and Liberal Catholic Churches (19th-20th centuries)===\n\nThe [[Old Catholic Church]] split from the [[Catholic Church]] in the 1870s because of the promulgation of the [[dogma]] of [[papal infallibility]] as promoted by the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1869\u20131870. The term 'Old Catholic' was first used in 1853 to describe the members of the See of Utrecht that were not under Papal authority. The Old Catholic movement grew in America but has not maintained ties with Utrecht, although talks are under way between independent Old Catholic bishops and Utrecht.\n\nThe [[Liberal Catholic Church]] started in 1916 via an Old Catholic bishop in London, bishop Matthew, who consecrated bishop James Wedgwood to the Episcopacy. This stream has in its relatively short existence known many splits, which operate worldwide under several names.\n\n===Eastern Christianity===\nIn the Eastern world, the largest body of believers in modern times is the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], sometimes imprecisely called \"Greek Orthodox\" because from the time of Christ through the Byzantine empire, Greek was its common language. However, the term \"[[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]]\" actually refers to only one portion of the entire Eastern Orthodox Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church believes itself to be the continuation of the original Christian Church established by [[Jesus Christ]], and the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. The Orthodox and Catholics have been separated since the 11th century, following the [[East\u2013West Schism]], with each of them claiming to represent the original pre-schism Church.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox consider themselves to be spiritually one body, which is administratively grouped into several [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] jurisdictions (also commonly referred to as \"churches\", despite being parts of one Church). They do not recognize any single bishop as universal church leader, but rather each bishop governs only his own [[diocese]]. The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] is known as the Ecumenical Patriarch, and holds the title \"[[primus inter pares|first among equals]]\", meaning only that if a great council is called, the patriarch sits as president of the council. He has no more power than any other bishop. Currently, the largest [[synod]] with the most members is the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Others include the ancient Patriarchates of [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antioch]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian]] and [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian]] Orthodox churches, and several smaller ones.\n[[File:Church of Saint John the Arab.jpg|thumb|225px|A 6th century Nestorian church, St. John the Arab, in the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] village of [[Andac|Geramon]].]]\nThe second largest Eastern Christian communion is [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodoxy]], which is organized in a similar manner, with six national autocephalous groups and two autonomous bodies, although there are greater internal differences than among the Eastern Orthodox (especially in the diversity of [[rite]]s being used). The six autocephalous Oriental Orthodox churches are the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] (Egyptian), [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]], [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenian]], [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church|Malankara]] (Indian), [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Eritrean]] Orthodox churches. In the Aramaic-speaking areas of the [[Middle East]], the Syriac Orthodox Church has long been dominant. Although the region of modern-day [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]] has had a strong body of believers since the infancy of Christianity, these regions only gained autocephaly in 1963 and 1994 respectively. The Oriental Orthodox are distinguished from the Eastern Orthodox by doctrinal differences concerning the union of human and divine natures in the person of Jesus Christ, and the two communions separated as a consequence of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in the year 451, although there have been recent moves towards reconciliation. Since these groups are relatively obscure in the West, literature on them has sometimes included the [[Church of the East]], which, like the Oriental Orthodox, originated in the 1st century A.D., but has not been in communion with them since before the [[Council of Ephesus]] of 431.\n\nLargely [[aniconic]], the Church of the East represents a third Eastern Christian tradition in its own right. In recent centuries, it has split into three Churches. The largest (since the early 20th century) is the [[Baghdad]]-based [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] formed from groups that entered communion with Rome at different times, beginning in 1552. The second-largest is what since 1976<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&dq=Assyrian+officially+1976&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOqPzw45LeAhWoDcAKHSd0BrMQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&q=Assyrian%20officially%201976&f=false Wilhelm Baum, Dietmar W. Winkler (editors), ''The Church of the East: A Concise History'' (Routledge 2003), p. 4]</ref> is officially called the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and which from 1933 to 2015 was headquartered first in [[Cyprus]] and then in the [[United States]], but whose present Catholicos-Patriarch, [[Gewargis III]], elected in 2015, lives in [[Erbil]], [[Iraq]]. The third is the [[Ancient Church of the East]], distinct since 1964 and headed by [[Addai II Giwargis]], resident in Baghdad.\n\nThere are also the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], most of which are counterparts of those listed above, sharing with them the same theological and liturgical traditions, but differing from them in that they recognize the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]] as the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|universal head of the Church]]. They are fully part of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic communion]], on the same level juridically as the [[Latin Church]]. Most of their members do not describe themselves as \"[[Roman Catholic (term)|''Roman'' Catholics]]\", a term they associate with membership of the Latin Church, and speak of themselves in relation to whichever Church they belong to: [[Maronite Church|Maronites]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkites]], [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholics]], [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholics]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholics]], etc.<ref>[http://www.crisismagazine.com/2011/we-are-non-roman-catholics Robert Spencer, \"We are Non-Roman Catholics\" in ''Crisis Magazine'', 22 November 2011]</ref>\n\nAnd finally the smallest Eastern Christian group founded in early 20th century is [[Byzantine Rite Lutheranism]] where accept Byzantine Rite as Church's liturgy while retaining their Lutheran traditions like [[Ukrainian Lutheran Church]]. It is considered part of [[Reformed Eastern Christianity]].\n\n===Western Christianity===\n{{Denominations of Christianity}}\n\nThe [[Latin Church|Latin portion]] of the [[Catholic Church]], along with [[Anglicanism]] and [[Protestantism]], comprise the three major divisions of [[Christianity]] in the Western world. Catholics do not describe themselves as a denomination but rather as the original Church; which all other branches broke off from in [[schism (religious)|schism]]. The [[Baptist]], [[Methodism|Methodist]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches are generally considered to be Protestant denominations, although strictly speaking, of these three, only the Lutherans took part in the official [[Protestation at Speyer]] after the decree of the [[Second Diet of Speyer]] mandated the burning of Luther's works and the end of the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nAnglicanism was generally classified as Protestant, but since the \"Tractarian\" or [[Oxford Movement]] of the 19th century, led by [[John Henry Newman]], Anglican writers emphasize a more [[Catholic (term)|catholic]] understanding of the church and characterize it as more properly understood as its own tradition\u2014a ''via media'' (\"middle way\"), ''both'' Protestant and Catholic. The American province of the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Episcopal Church USA]], describes itself as a modern ''via media'' church in this tradition. A case is sometimes also made to regard Lutheranism in a similar way, considering the catholic character of its foundational documents (the [[Augsburg Confession]] and other documents contained in the [[Book of Concord]]) and its existence prior to the Anglican, Anabaptist, and [[Reformed]] churches, from which nearly all other Protestant denominations derive.\n\nOne central tenet of Catholicism (which is a common point between Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some other Churches), is its practice of [[apostolic succession]]. \"Apostle\" means \"one who is sent out\". Jesus commissioned the first [[twelve apostles]] (see [[Biblical Figures]] for the list of the Twelve), and they, in turn laid hands on subsequent church leaders to ordain (commission) them for ministry. In this manner, Catholics and Anglicans trace their ordained ministers all the way back to the original Twelve.\n\nCatholics believe that the [[Pope]] has authority which can be traced directly to the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]] whom they hold to be the original head of and first Pope of the [[Christian Church|Church]]. There are smaller churches, such as the [[Old Catholic Church]] which rejected the definition of [[Papal Infallibility]] at the [[First Vatican Council]], and [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] who believe that Anglicanism is a continuation of historical [[Catholicism]] and who incorporate many Catholic beliefs and practices. The Catholic Church refers to itself simply by the terms ''Catholic'' and ''Catholicism'' (which mean universal).\n\nSometimes, Catholics, based on a strict interpretation of ''[[extra ecclesiam nulla salus]]'' (\"Outside the Church, there is no salvation\"), rejected any notion those outside its communion could be regarded as part of any true Catholic Christian faith, an attitude rejected by the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962{{ndash}}1965).<ref name=\"UnitatisRed\">\u00abIt remains true that all who have been justified by faith in Baptism are members of Christ's body, and have a right to be called Christian, and so are correctly accepted as brothers by the children of the Catholic Church.\u00bb [https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html Second Vatican Council, Decree on Ecumenism ''Unitatis Redintegratio'', n.3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306113628/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html |date=March 6, 2013 }}</ref> Catholicism has a hierarchical structure in which supreme authority for matters of faith and practice are the exclusive domain of the Pope, who sits on the Throne of Peter, and the bishops when acting in union with him. Most Catholics are unaware of the existence of [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholicism]] which represents a relatively recent split from the Catholic Church and is particularly vocal in rejecting their use of the term ''Catholic''.\n\nEach Protestant movement has developed freely, and many have split over theological issues. For instance, a number of movements grew out of spiritual [[Revivalism|revivals]], such as [[Pentecostalism]]. Doctrinal issues and matters of [[conscience]] have also divided Protestants. The [[Anabaptist]] tradition, made up of the [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]], rejected the Roman Catholic and Lutheran doctrines of [[pedobaptism|infant baptism]]; this tradition is also noted for its belief in [[pacifism]]. Still others formed out of administrative issues; [[Methodism]] branched off as its own group of denominations when the [[American Revolutionary War]] complicated the movement's ability to ordain ministers (it had begun as a movement within the Church of England). In Methodism's case, it has undergone a number of administrative schisms and mergers with other denominations (especially those associated with the [[holiness movement]] in the 20th century).\n\nMany churches with roots in [[Restorationism]] reject being identified as Protestant or even as a denomination at all, as they use only the Bible and not creeds, and model the church after what they feel is the first-century church found in scripture; the [[Churches of Christ]] are one example; [[African Initiated Church]]es, like [[Kimbanguism]], mostly fall within Protestantism, with varying degrees of syncretism. The measure of mutual acceptance between the denominations and movements varies, but is growing largely due to the [[ecumenism|ecumenical movement]] in the 20th century and overarching Christian bodies such as the [[World Council of Churches]].\n\n===Christians with Jewish roots===\n{{Main|Jewish Christian|Messianic Judaism|Hebrew Christian movement}}\n[[Messianic Jews]] maintain a Jewish identity while accepting Jesus as the [[Messiah]] and the [[New Testament]] as authoritative. After the founding of the church, the [[Jewish Christian|disciples of Jesus]] generally retained their ethnic origins while accepting the [[Gospel]] message. The [[Council of Jerusalem|first church council was called in Jerusalem]] to address just this issue, and the deciding opinion was written by [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], the first bishop of Jerusalem and a pivotal figure in the Christian movement. The history of Messianic Judaism includes many movements and groups and defies any simple classification scheme.\n\nThe 19th century saw at least 250,000 Jews convert to Christianity according to existing records of various societies.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Stanley N | last1 = Gundry | first2 = Louis | last2 = Goldberg | title = How Jewish is Christianity?: 2 views on the Messianic movement | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sYfcuBdLqyEC&pg=PA24 | publisher = Google | format = Books | page = 24}}.</ref> Data from the [[Pew Research Center]] has it that, as of 2013, about 1.6 million adult [[American Jews]] identify themselves as [[Christians]], most as [[Protestant]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/02/how-many-jews-are-there-in-the-united-states/|title=How many Jews are there in the United States?|work=Pew Research Center}}</ref><ref name=\"pew: portrait\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/chapter-1-population-estimates/|title=A PORTRAIT OF JEWISH AMERICANS: Chapter 1: Population Estimates|work=Pew Research Center}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/.premium-1.549713|title=American-Jewish Population Rises to 6.8 Million|work=haaretz}}</ref> According to the same data, most of the Jews who identify themselves as some sort of Christian (1.6 million) were raised as Jews or are Jews by ancestry.<ref name=\"pew: portrait\" />\n\n==Modern history==\n\n===Quakers===\nSome denominations which arose alongside the Western Christian tradition consider themselves Christian, but neither Catholic nor wholly Protestant, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). Quakerism began as an evangelical Christian movement in 17th century [[England]], eschewing priests and all formal Anglican or [[Catholic sacraments]] in their worship, including many of those practices that remained among the stridently Protestant [[Puritan]]s such as baptism with water. They were known in America for helping with the Underground Railroad, and like the Mennonites, Quakers traditionally refrain from participation in war.\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n{{Main|Latter Day Saint movement|Mormonism}}\n{{See also|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|Mormonism and Christianity}}\nMost Latter Day Saint denominations are derived from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)]] established by [[Joseph Smith]] in 1830. The largest worldwide denomination is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], often referred to as [[Mormonism]]. Various considerably smaller sects broke from this movement after its relocation to the Rocky Mountains in the mid-1800s. Several of these broke away over the abandonment of practicing [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]] after the [[1890 Manifesto]]. Most of the \"Prairie Saint\" denominations (see below) were established after [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]] by the remnants of the Latter Day Saints who did not go west with [[Brigham Young]]. Many of these opposed some of the 1840s theological developments in favor of 1830s theological understandings and practices. Other denominations are defined by either a belief in Joseph Smith as a [[prophet]] or acceptance of the [[Book of Mormon]] as [[religious text|scripture]]. [[Mormons]] generally consider themselves to be [[Restorationism|restorationist]], believing that Smith, as [[prophet, seer, and revelator]], restored the original and true Church of Christ to the earth. Some Latter Day Saint denominations are regarded by other Christians as being [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] or even non-Christian, but the Latter Day Saints are predominantly in disagreement with these claims. Mormons see themselves as believing in a [[God in Mormonism|Godhead]] comprising the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost as separate personages united in purpose. Mormons regard traditional definitions of the [[Trinity]] as aberrations of true doctrine and emblematic of the [[Great Apostasy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Articles of Faith, no. 1|url=http://mormon.org/articles-of-faith|access-date=2014-01-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531162806/http://mormon.org/articles-of-faith|archive-date=2013-05-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> but they do not accept certain trinitarian definitions in the [[List of Christian creeds|post-apostolic creeds]], such as the [[Athanasian Creed]].\n\n===Second Great Awakening===\n{{Main|Second Great Awakening|Restorationism|Restoration Movement}}\nThe Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement began on the American frontier during the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1790\u20131870) of the early 19th century.

The second began in western Pennsylvania and Virginia (now West Virginia) and was led by [[Thomas Campbell (clergyman)|Thomas Campbell]] and his son, [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]]; they used the name \"[[Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement)|Disciples of Christ]]\". Both groups sought to restore the whole Christian church on the pattern set forth in the [[New Testament]], and both believed that [[creed]]s kept Christianity divided. In 1832 they joined in fellowship with a handshake.\n\nAmong other things, they were united in the belief that [[Jesus]] is the Christ, the [[Son of God]]; that Christians should celebrate the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|first day of each week]]; and that [[Believer's baptism|baptism of adult believers]] by [[Immersion baptism|immersion in water]] is a necessary condition for [[salvation]]. Because the founders wanted to abandon all denominational labels, they used the biblical names for the followers of Jesus.<ref name=\"McAlister & Tucker, 1975\">McAlister, Lester G. and Tucker, William E.

There are three main branches in the US: the [[Churches of Christ]], the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]], and the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]. Other U.S.-based groups affiliated with the movement are the [[International Churches of Christ]] and the [[International Christian Churches]]. Non-U.S. groups include the [[Churches of Christ in Australia]], the [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]], the [[Churches of Christ in Europe]]. The [[Plymouth Brethren]] are a similar though historically unrelated group which originated in the United Kingdom. Some churches, such as [[Churches of Christ]] or the [[Plymouth Brethren]] reject formal ties with other churches within the movement.\n\nOther Christian groups originating during the Second Great Awakening including the [[Millerites|Adventist movement]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Albin |first1=Barry |title=A Spiritual History of the Western Tradition |page=124}}</ref> the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Van Voorst, Robert E.|title=RELG: World (with Religion CourseMate with eBook Printed Access Card)|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=288|year=2012|isbn=978-1-1117-2620-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvNWxEEaf50C&pg=PT303}}</ref> and [[Christian Science]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eddy |first1=Mary Baker |title=Manual of the Mother Church |publisher=CSPS |page=17 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18039}}</ref> founded within fifty years of one another, all consider themselves to be restorative of primitive Christianity and the early church.

Their common denominator is that they sought God in \"Spirit and Truth\", ([[Gospel of John]] 4:24) rather than in the Church of official Orthodoxy or ancient rites of [[Old Believers]]. Rejecting the official church, they considered their religious organization as a homogeneous community, without division into laymen and clergy.\n\nIn the 1830s, Ivan Grigorev Kanygin founded religious communities with communal practices in the [[Novouzensk]] region. They called themselves Communists or Methodists, but from the 1870s became known as \"Mormons\", by comparison with the contemporaneous American movement. An unrelated community known as \"Samara Mormons\" developed near the [[Volga]] city of [[Samara, Russia|Samara]]. They avoided alcohol, tobacco, and swearing, cooperated in commercial enterprises, and governed themselves by \"apostles\" and \"prophets\".\n\nA more recent charismatic movement in Russia is the \"[[Vissarion|Church of the Last Testament]]\", which established a substantial settlement in the Siberian Taiga in the 1990s.\n\n===Iglesia ni Cristo===\nDue to a number of similarities, some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writers describe the doctrines of the Philippines originating [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] as restorationist in outlook and theme.<ref name=annharper>{{cite journal|title=The Iglesia ni Cristo and Evangelical Christianity|journal=Journal of Asian Mission|year=2001|first=Ann C.|last=Harper|volume=3|issue=1|pages=101\u2013119|id=|url=http://www.apologeticsindex.org/docs/iglesia_ni_cristo_and_evangelical_christianity.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-11-05}}</ref> INC, however, does not consider itself to be part of the [[Restoration Movement]].

These churches share a [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] predisposition and understanding of the [[Bible]] and were strongly influenced by the [[Transcendentalist]] movement\u2014particularly the work of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]. Another antecedent of this movement was [[Swedenborgianism]], founded in 1787 on the writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who claimed to have received a new revelation from Jesus Christ through continuous heavenly visions which he experienced over a period of at least twenty-five years.<ref>William James, [http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JamVari.sgm&images=images/modeg&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=parsed&tag=public&part=all \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. pp.92-93.

It was founded in 1922 in Switzerland by the Lutheran theologian and minister Friedrich Rittlemeyer, inspired by [[Rudolf Steiner]], the Austrian philosopher and founder of [[anthroposophy]]. Christian Community congregations exist as financially independent groups with regional and international administrative bodies overseeing their work. There are approximately 350 worldwide. The international headquarters are in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe Christian Community does not require its members to conform to any specific teaching or behaviour.<ref>Tom Ravetz: ''Free From Dogma. Theological Reflections in The Christian Community.'' Edinburgh 2009\n</ref> Seven sacraments are celebrated within the Community: the [[Eucharist]], generally called the ''Act of Consecration of Man'', and six other sacraments: [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], [[Marriage]], The Last [[Anointing]], Sacramental Consultation (replacing [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), and [[Ordination]].<ref>Evelyn Francis Capel and Tom Ravetz, ''Seven Sacraments in the Christian Community'', Floris Books, 1999</ref>\n\n=== Way Followers Christian Institution ===\nA Christian denomination founded in 2016 by Arthur David Beaman and approved as a tax-exempt church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/81-1380942|title=Guidestar|last=|first=|date=|website=www.guidestar.org|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref> It classifies itself as a contemporary version of the [[Ebionites]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestabor.com/ebionites-nazarenes-tracking-the-original-followers-of-jesus/|title=Ebionites & Nazarenes: Tracking the Original Followers of Jesus|date=2015-12-30|website=TaborBlog|language=en|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref> The original Jewish Christian Church in Jerusalem, headed by James the Just, was Ebionite. Members of the [[Way Followers Christian Institution]] (WFCI) follow the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. They are not strict observers of the Torah. Rather, they interpret the Torah in a contemporary context, such as interpreting the dietary laws, [[Kashrut]], as being God's way of keeping the Israelites from eating unhealthy food in an age where disease was not understood as it is today. They also use contemporary relevant sections of the Didache in their religious ethics and services.\n\nContained within the WFCI is a religious order, the Society of James the Just (SJJ).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamesthejustsociety.org|title=jamesthejustsociety.org|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2019|website=Society of James the Just|access-date=}}</ref> The SJJ also serves as a charitable ministry within the WFCI, providing services for the poor.\n\n===Other movements===\nProtestant denominations have shown a strong tendency towards diversification and fragmentation, giving rise to numerous churches and movements, especially in Anglo-American religious history, where the process is cast in terms of a series of \"[[Great Awakening]]s\".\nThe most recent wave of diversification, known as the [[Fourth Great Awakening]] took place during the 1960s to 1980s and resulted in phenomena such as the [[Charismatic Movement]], the [[Jesus movement]], and a great number of [[Parachurch organization]]s based in [[Evangelicalism]].\n\nMany independent churches and movements considered themselves to be [[Nondenominational|non-denominational]], but may vary greatly in doctrine. Many of these, like the [[Local churches (affiliation)|local churches]] movement, reflect the core teachings of traditional Christianity. Others however, such as [[The Way International]], have been denounced as cults by the [[Christian anti-cult movement]].\n\nTwo movements, which are entirely unrelated in their founding, but share a common element of an additional Messiah (or incarnation of Christ) are the [[Unification Church]] and the [[Rastafari movement]]. These movements fall outside of traditional [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] of Christian groups, though both cite the Christian Bible as a basis for their beliefs.\n\n[[Syncretism]] of Christian beliefs with local and tribal religions is a phenomenon that occurs throughout the world. An example of this is the [[Native American Church]]. The ceremonies of this group are strongly tied to the use of [[peyote]]. (Parallels may be drawn here with the Rastafari [[Entheogen|spiritual use]] of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].) While traditions vary from tribe to tribe, they often include a belief in Jesus as a Native American cultural hero, an intercessor for man, or a spiritual guardian; belief in the Bible; and an association of Jesus with peyote.\n\nThere are also some Christians that reject organized religion altogether. Some [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] - often those of a Protestant background - believe that the [[Ministry of Jesus|original teachings of Jesus]] were corrupted by Roman statism (compare [[Early Christianity]] and [[State church of the Roman Empire]]), and that earthly authority such as government, or indeed the established Church, do not and should not have power over them. Following \"[[Ethic of reciprocity|The Golden Rule]]\", many oppose the use of physical force in any circumstance, and advocate [[nonviolence]].

In 1963, Michels began providing outside plant construction and installation of buried telephone cable systems. The company expanded again in 1970, forming a Sewer, Water and Tunnel Division.<ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/michels-corporation</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Michels began producing crushed [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] to supply materials for various road and building construction projects throughout eastern [[Wisconsin]]. The next year, 1977, Michels began constructing rural water distribution systems throughout the [[Northern Plains]]. As part of this development, the company constructed water mains, laterals and residential water service.\n \nMichels branched out into [[fiber optic]] cable systems in 1983. The company built customized equipment, including the design and fabrication of rail-mounted cable plows.\n\nIn 1988, Michels began a new method known as [[horizontal directional drilling]] to construct underground utilities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.trenchlessonline.com/index/webapp-stories-action?id=804 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531113650/http://www.trenchlessonline.com/index/webapp-stories-action?id=804 |archive-date=2009-05-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The company expanded on this when it designed and manufactured the most powerful directional drilling rig to date in 1996. The rig was called \"Hercules-1200\" for its 1,200,000 pounds of push/pullback.\n\nMichels acquired Superior Electric Company of [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], in 1997, and changed the name to Michels Power. The company also established Michels Directional Crossings Co. in [[Canada]].\n\nTwo years later, Michels acquired [[Redmond, Washington]]-based Pilchuck Contractors, Inc., to add to its West Coast capabilities. Michels also manufactured a second \"Hercules-1200\" in 1999.<ref>http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-109669469/2003-large-directional-drilling.html</ref>\n\nIn 2001, what had been Michels Pipeline Construction became Michels Corporation due to the wide array of services the company had become involved in. Michels Corporation continued expanding in 2002, acquiring BBC as part of its Mid-America Line and Cable division. Michels also acquired Anderson Bros. & Johnson of [[Wausau, Wisconsin]], the only company to mine deep-red granite in North America.\n\nIn 2003, the company also added yet another division in Michels Drilled Foundations.\n\nMichels Mid-American Line and Cable changed its name to Michels Communications in 2004. The company also made another move on the West Coast, acquiring the [[cured-in-place pipe]] business of Gelco Services, Inc., based in Salem, Ore. The pipe rehabilitation operations are now called Michels Pipe Services. Michels also manufactured another [[drilling rig]], the DD-840, bringing its total fleet to more than 65 drilling rigs.  \n\nMichels Paving was formed in 2005, offering paving services to public and private sectors. This move was bolstered by the assets of recently acquired PCC Construction Co. and its sister companies.<ref>http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11263024_ITM</ref><ref>http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/rbi/WBM042805_6</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Michels Sewer, Water and Tunnel division took on a new identity as Michels Tunneling.<ref>http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-33560502_ITM</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Michels celebrated its 50th anniversary. <ref>http://trenchlessonline.com/family-values/</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Michels acquired Continental Fabrication Services, a full-service pipe fabrication operation in Carrollton, Mo. \n\nIn 2012, Michels acquired the foundations business of Edward E.

In 1963, Michels began providing outside plant construction and installation of buried telephone cable systems. The company expanded again in 1970, forming a Sewer, Water and Tunnel Division.<ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/michels-corporation</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Michels began producing crushed [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] to supply materials for various road and building construction projects throughout eastern [[Wisconsin]]. The next year, 1977, Michels began constructing rural water distribution systems throughout the [[Northern Plains]]. As part of this development, the company constructed water mains, laterals and residential water service.\n \nMichels branched out into [[fiber optic]] cable systems in 1983. The company built customized equipment, including the design and fabrication of rail-mounted cable plows.\n\nIn 1988, Michels began a new method known as [[horizontal directional drilling]] to construct underground utilities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.trenchlessonline.com/index/webapp-stories-action?id=804 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531113650/http://www.trenchlessonline.com/index/webapp-stories-action?id=804 |archive-date=2009-05-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The company expanded on this when it designed and manufactured the most powerful directional drilling rig to date in 1996. The rig was called \"Hercules-1200\" for its 1,200,000 pounds of push/pullback.\n\nMichels acquired Superior Electric Company of [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], in 1997, and changed the name to Michels Power. The company also established Michels Directional Crossings Co. in [[Canada]].\n\nTwo years later, Michels acquired [[Redmond, Washington]]-based Pilchuck Contractors, Inc., to add to its West Coast capabilities. Michels also manufactured a second \"Hercules-1200\" in 1999.<ref>http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-109669469/2003-large-directional-drilling.html</ref>\n\nIn 2001, what had been Michels Pipeline Construction became Michels Corporation due to the wide array of services the company had become involved in. Michels Corporation continued expanding in 2002, acquiring BBC as part of its Mid-America Line and Cable division. Michels also acquired Anderson Bros. & Johnson of [[Wausau, Wisconsin]], the only company to mine deep-red granite in North America.\n\nIn 2003, the company also added yet another division in Michels Drilled Foundations.\n\nMichels Mid-American Line and Cable changed its name to Michels Communications in 2004. The company also made another move on the West Coast, acquiring the [[cured-in-place pipe]] business of Gelco Services, Inc., based in Salem, Ore. The pipe rehabilitation operations are now called Michels Pipe Services. Michels also manufactured another [[drilling rig]], the DD-840, bringing its total fleet to more than 65 drilling rigs.  \n\nMichels Paving was formed in 2005, offering paving services to public and private sectors.

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, but their visibility depends on the life stage of the organism. A characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often referred to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli). The membranes' proximity to one another often makes them difficult to distinguish. This structure is often also referred to as the tri-layered structure. Beneath the inner membrane a [[Basal lamina|basal (internal) lamina]] can be seen. This basal lamina separates the epicytic foldings from the rest of the cell. These epicytic foldings form the outer surface of G. garnhami and hundreds of these can be observed at the surface enlarging the surface of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vivier |first1=E |last2=Petitprez |first2=A |title=The outer membrane complex and its development at the time of the formation of daughter cells in Toxoplasma gondii|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |date=November 1969 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=329\u201342 |doi=10.1083/jcb.43.2.329 |pmid=5344151|pmc=2107857 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=M.

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, but their visibility depends on the life stage of the organism. A characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often referred to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli). The membranes' proximity to one another often makes them difficult to distinguish. This structure is often also referred to as the tri-layered structure. Beneath the inner membrane a [[Basal lamina|basal (internal) lamina]] can be seen. This basal lamina separates the epicytic foldings from the rest of the cell. These epicytic foldings form the outer surface of G. garnhami and hundreds of these can be observed at the surface enlarging the surface of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vivier |first1=E |last2=Petitprez |first2=A |title=The outer membrane complex and its development at the time of the formation of daughter cells in Toxoplasma gondii|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |date=November 1969 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=329\u201342 |doi=10.1083/jcb.43.2.329 |pmid=5344151|pmc=2107857 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=M.

Up to 10 000 gregarines can be present in one host without an effect of the shedding or food-uptake of the host.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harry |first1=Owen G. |title=Gregarines: their Effect on the Growth of the Desert Locust ( Schistocerca gregaria ) |journal=Nature |date=March 1970 |volume=225 |issue=5236 |pages=964\u2013966 |doi=10.1038/225964a0 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/225964a0 |language=en |issn=1476-4687}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n{{EB1911 Poster|Gregarines}}\n* [http://tolweb.org/Gregarina/124806 Tree of Life Gregarina]\n* [http://tolweb.org/movies/Gregarina/124806 Gregarina Movies]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Conoidasida]]\n[[Category:Endoparasites]]\n[[Category:Alveolata]]\n[[Category:Apicomplexa stubs]]\n", "name_user": "Garnhami", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregarina_garnhami"}
