He helped found The [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] (also known as the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade) and helped achieve passage of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] of 1807, which ended British trade in slaves.\n\nIn his later years Clarkson campaigned for the abolition of slavery worldwide; it was then concentrated in the Americas. In 1840, he was the key speaker at the [[Anti-Slavery Society]]'s (today known as [[Anti-Slavery International]]) first conference in London, England which campaigned to end slavery in other countries.\n\n==Early life and education==\nClarkson was the eldest son of Rev. John Clarkson (1710\u20131766), an Anglican priest and curate of [[Walsoken]], [[Norfolk]]. He was baptised on 26 May 1760.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.wisbechmuseum.org.uk/blog/post.php?s=2019-12-19-first-museum-job-and-parish-registers|title=parish registers|website=wisbechmiseum.org|accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref>\nHis brother John was born on 4 April 1764. They had a sister Anne.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Clarksons of Wisbech|author=Ellen Gibson Wilson|publisher=Wisbech Society|year=1992}}</ref> Both boys attended [[Wisbech Grammar School]], Hill Street where the family lived and their father was headmaster; Thomas went on to [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London in 1775. He did his undergraduate work at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], beginning in 1779.<ref>{{acad|id=CLRK779T2|name=Clarkson, Thomas}}</ref> An excellent student, he appears to have enjoyed his time at university, although he was also a serious, devout man. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in 1783 and was set to continue at Cambridge to follow in his father's footsteps and enter the [[Anglican Church]]. He was ordained a [[deacon#Anglicanism|deacon]] but never proceeded to priest's orders.\n\n==Revelation of the horrors of slavery==\nIt was at Cambridge in 1785 that Clarkson entered a [[Latin]] essay competition that was to set him on the course for most of the remainder of his life. The topic of the essay, set by university vice-chancellor [[Peter Peckard]], was ''Anne liceat invitos in servitutem dare'' (\"Is it lawful to enslave the unconsenting?\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0275%2FClarkson|title=Janus: Papers of Thomas Clarkson|publisher=University of Cambridge}}</ref> and it led Clarkson to consider the question of the [[slave trade]]. He read everything he could on the subject, including the works of [[Anthony Benezet]], a [[Quaker]] [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], as well as first hand accounts of the African slave trade such as [[Francis Moore (geographer)|Francis Moore's]] ''Travels into the Interior Parts of Africa''. He also researched the topic by meeting and interviewing those who had personal experience of the slave trade and of slavery.\n\nAfter winning the prize, Clarkson had what he called a spiritual revelation from God as he travelled by horseback between [[Cambridge]] and London. He broke up his journey at [[Wadesmill]], near [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], Hertfordshire. He later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>As it is usual to read these essays publicly in the senate-house soon after the prize is adjudged, I was called to Cambridge for this purpose. I went and performed my office. On returning however to London, the subject of it almost wholly engrossed my thoughts. I became at times very seriously affected while upon the road. I stopped my horse occasionally, and dismounted and walked. I frequently tried to persuade myself in these intervals that the contents of my Essay could not be true. The more however I reflected upon them, or rather upon the authorities on which they were founded, the more I gave them credit. Coming in sight of Wades Mill in Hertfordshire, I sat down disconsolate on the turf by the roadside and held my horse. Here a thought came into my mind, that if the contents of the Essay were true, it was time some person should see these calamities to their end. Agitated in this manner I reached home. This was in the summer of 1785.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clarkson\n|first=Thomas\n|authorlink=Thomas Clarkson\n|date=1808\n|volume=1\n|title=The History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave-Trade by the British Parliament|publisher=[[Longman, Hurst, Rees and Orme]]\n|location=London\n|pages=209&ndash;210\n|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/12428/pg12428-images.html}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis experience and sense of calling ultimately led him to devote his life to abolishing the slave trade.\n\nHaving translated the essay into English so that it could gain a wider audience, Clarkson published it in pamphlet-form in 1786 as ''An essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species, particularly the African, translated from a Latin Dissertation.'' It was honoured with the first prize in the University of Cambridge, for the year 1785.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10611\n|title=An Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species, Particularly the African.

These included influential men such as [[James Ramsay (abolitionist)|James Ramsay]] and [[Granville Sharp]], many Quakers, and other [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]]s. The movement had been gathering strength for some years, having been founded by [[Quakers]] both in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and in the United States, with support from other nonconformists, primarily Methodists and Baptists, on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1783, 300 Quakers, chiefly from the London area, presented [[British Parliament|Parliament]] with their signatures on the first petition against the slave trade.\n\nFollowing this step, a small offshoot group formed the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]], a small non-denominational group that could lobby more successfully by incorporating Anglicans, who sat in Parliament. (Quakers were barred from Parliament until the early nineteenth century, whereas clergy of the Anglican Church had the right to seats in the House of Lords). The twelve founding members included nine Quakers, and three pioneering Anglicans: Clarkson, [[Granville Sharp]], and Philip Sansom. They were sympathetic to the religious revival that had predominantly nonconformist origins, but which sought wider non-denominational support for a \"Great Awakening\" amongst believers.\n\n==Anti-slavery campaign==\nEncouraged by publication of Clarkson's essay, an informal committee was set up between small groups from the petitioning Quakers, Clarkson and others, with the goal of lobbying members of parliament (MPs). In May 1787, they formed the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]]. The Committee included [[Granville Sharp]] as chairman and [[Josiah Wedgwood]], as well as Clarkson. Clarkson also approached the young [[William Wilberforce]], who as an Anglican and an MP was connected within the British Parliament. Wilberforce was one of few parliamentarians to have had sympathy with the Quaker petition; he had already put a question about the slave trade before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and became known as one of the earliest Anglican abolitionists.\n\nClarkson took a leading part in the affairs of the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]], and was tasked to collect evidence to support the abolition of the slave trade. He faced much opposition from supporters of the trade in some of the cities he visited. The slave traders were an influential group because the trade was a legitimate and highly lucrative business, generating prosperity for many of the ports.\n\n[[Liverpool]] was a major base of slave trading syndicates and home port for their ships. In 1787, Clarkson was attacked and nearly killed when visiting the city, as a gang of sailors was paid to assassinate him. He barely escaped with his life. Elsewhere, however, he gathered support. Clarkson's speech at the collegiate church in Manchester (now [[Manchester Cathedral]]) on 28 October 1787 galvanised the anti-slavery campaign in the city. That same year, Clarkson published the pamphlet ''A Summary View of the Slave Trade and of the Probable Consequences of Its Abolition''.\n\nClarkson was very effective at giving the Committee a high public profile: he spent the next two years travelling around England, promoting the cause and gathering evidence. He interviewed 20,000 sailors during his research. He obtained equipment used on slave-ships, such as iron handcuffs, leg-shackles, and [[thumbscrew (torture)|thumbscrews]]; instruments for forcing open slaves' jaws; and branding irons. He published engravings of the tools in pamphlets and displayed the instruments at public meetings.\n\n[[File:Seven Stars Bristol.jpg|thumb|Clarkson visited [[Seven Stars Public House, Bristol|The Seven Stars]] in Bristol for research.]]\nClarkson's research took him to English ports such as [[Bristol]], where he received much data from the landlord of the [[Seven Stars Public House, Bristol|Seven Stars pub]]. (The building still stands in Thomas Lane.) He also travelled repeatedly to [[Liverpool]] and London, collecting vital evidence to support the abolitionist case.<ref name=\"collecting\"/>\n\nClarkson visited ''The Lively,'' an African trading ship. Although not a slave ship, it carried cargo of high quality goods: [[carved ivory]] and [[woven textiles]], [[beeswax]], and produce such as [[palm oil]] and [[Capsicum|peppers]]. Impressed by the high quality of craftsmanship and skill expressed in these items, Clarkson was horrified to think that the people who could create such items were being enslaved. He bought samples from the ship and started a collection to which he added over the years. It included crops, spices and [[raw material]]s, along with refined trade goods.<ref name=\"abolition\"/>\n  \t\t  \t\t\nClarkson noticed that pictures and artefacts could influence public opinion more than words alone. He began to display items from his collection of fine goods to reinforce his anti-slavery lectures. Demonstrating that Africans were highly skilled artisans, he argued for an alternative humane trading system based on goods rather than labourers. He carried a \"box\" featuring his collection, which became an important part his public meetings. It was an early example of a visual aid.<ref name=\"abolition\">[http://abolition.e2bn.org/box.html Home: \"Thomas Clarkson\"], Abolition Project website. Retrieved 28 September 2014.</ref>\n\nHe rode by horseback some 35,000&nbsp;miles for evidence and visited local anti-slave trade societies founded across the country. He enlisted the help of [[Alexander Falconbridge]] and James Arnold, two ship's surgeons whom he met in Liverpool. They had been on many voyages aboard slave ships, and were able to recount their experiences in detail for publication.<ref name=\"collecting\">[http://abolition.e2bn.org/box_58.html \"Thomas Clarkson: Collecting Evidence\"], The Abolition Project website. Retrieved 28 September 2014.</ref>\n\nClarkson also continued to write against the slave trade. He filled his works with vivid firsthand descriptions from sailors, surgeons and others who had been involved in the slave traffic. In 1788 Clarkson published large numbers of his ''Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade'' (1788). Another example was his \"An Essay on the Slave Trade\" (1789), the account of a sailor who had served aboard a slave ship. These works provided a grounding for William Wilberforce's first abolitionist speech in the House of Commons on 12 May 1789, and his 12 propositions.\n\n[[Olaudah Equiano]] (Gustavus Vassa) a member of the [[Sons of Africa]] published his memoir, one of the genre of what became known as [[slave narratives]] \u2013 accounts by slaves who achieved freedom. As an African with direct experience of the slave trade and slavery, Equiano was pleased that his book became highly influential in the anti-slavery movement. Clarkson wrote to the Rev. Mr. Jones at [[Trinity College (Cambridge)|Trinity College]], to introduce Equiano to him and the community. He asked for aid from the Rev. Jones in selling copies of the memoir and arranging for Equiano to visit Cambridge to lecture.\n\nIn 1791 Wilberforce introduced the first Bill to abolish the slave trade; it was easily defeated by 163 votes to 88. As Wilberforce continued to bring the issue of the slave trade before Parliament, Clarkson travelled and wrote anti-slavery works. Based on a plan of a slave ship he acquired in Portsmouth, he had an image drawn of slaves loaded on the slave ship ''Brookes;'' he published this in London in 1791, took the image with him on lectures, and provided it to Wilberforce with other anti-slave trade materials for use in parliament.<ref name=\"diagram\">[http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/asset72540_1315-abolition.html \"Brookes' Diagram-Clarkson's Box\"], The Abolition Project, 2009. Retrieved 28 September 2014</ref> (See image \"Brookes' Diagram-Clarkson's Box\", The Abolition Project, 2009.)\n[[File:Thomas Clarkson, 1760-1846 RMG E9112.tiff|thumb|left|Portrait of Clarkson, circa 1840]]\nThis was the beginning of their protracted parliamentary campaign, during which Wilberforce introduced a motion in favour of abolition almost every year. Clarkson, Wilberforce and the other members of the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] and their supporters, were responsible for generating and sustaining a national movement that mobilised public opinion as never before. Parliament, however, refused to pass the bill. The outbreak of [[Napoleonic Wars|War with France]] effectively prevented further debate for many years.\n\nBy 1794, Clarkson's health was failing, as he suffered from exhaustion. He retired from the campaign and spent some time in the [[Lake District]], where he bought an estate at [[Ullswater]]. There he became a friend of the poet [[William Wordsworth]].\n\nIn January 1796 he married Catherine Buck of [[Bury St Edmunds]], Suffolk; their only child Thomas was born in 1796. They moved back to the south of England for the sake of Catherine's health, and settled at [[Bury St Edmunds]] from 1806 to 1816. Next they lived at Playford Hall, located halfway between [[Ipswich]] and [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]].\n\nWhen the war with France appeared to be almost over, in 1804 Clarkson and his allies revived the anti-slave trade campaign. After his ten years' retreat, he mounted his horse to travel again all over Great Britain and canvass support for the measure. He appeared to have returned with all his old enthusiasm and vigour. He was especially active in persuading MPs to back the parliamentary campaign.\n\nPassage of the [[Slave Trade Act]] in 1807 ended the trade and provided for British naval support to enforce the law. Clarkson directed his efforts toward enforcement and extending the campaign to the rest of Europe, as Spain and France continued a trade in their American colonies. The United States also prohibited the international trade in 1807, and operated chiefly in the Caribbean to interdict illegal slave ships. In 1808 Clarkson published a book about the progress in abolition of the slave trade.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarkson|first=Thomas|title=The History of the Rise, Progress And Accomplishment of the Abolition of the Slave \u2013 Trade by the British Parliament|year=1808|publisher=James P. Parke|location=Philadelphia}}</ref> He travelled to Paris in 1814 and [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1818, trying to reach international agreement on a timetable for abolition of the trade.  He contributed the article on the \"Slave Trade\" for ''[[Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia]],'' Vol. 33, 1816.\n\n==Later career==\n{{Anti-Slavery Society Convention 1840|align=right|size=250px|caption=Clarkson is the central figure in this painting which is of the 1840 Anti-Slavery Convention.<ref name=npg>[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?search=ap&npgno=599&eDate=&lDate= The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840], [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]], 1841, [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], London, NPG599, Given by [[Anti-Slavery International|British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]] in 1880</ref> <small>Move your cursor to identify his relatives and the great and good (or click icon to enlarge).</small>}} \nIn 1823 the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery (later known as the [[Anti-Slavery Society]]) was formed. Clarkson travelled the country to build support for its goal. He covered 10,000&nbsp;miles, and activated the network of sympathetic anti-slavery societies which had been formed. This resulted in 777 petitions being delivered to parliament demanding the total emancipation of slaves. When the society adopted a policy of immediate emancipation, Clarkson and Wilberforce appeared together for the last time to lend their support. In 1833 the [[Slavery Abolition Act]] was passed, with emancipation to be completed by 1838 in the British colonies.\n\nClarkson lived an additional 13&nbsp;years. Although his eyesight was failing, he continued to campaign for abolition, focusing on the United States, where slavery had expanded in the Deep South and some states west of the Mississippi River. He was the principal speaker in 1840 at the opening of the first [[World's Anti-Slavery Convention]] in [[Freemasons' Hall, London|Freemasons' Hall]], London, chaired by [[Thomas Binney]]. The conference was designed to build support for abolishing slavery worldwide and included delegates from France, the USA, [[Haiti]] (established in 1804 as the first black republic in the Western Hemisphere) and [[Jamaica]].\n\nThe scene at Clarkson's opening address was painted in a commemorative work, now in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]], London. The emancipated slave, [[Henry Beckford]] (a Baptist deacon in Jamaica), is shown in the right foreground. Clarkson and the prominent abolitionist Quaker [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]] were to the left, the main axis of interest. In 1846 Clarkson was host to [[Frederick Douglass]], an American former slave who had escaped to freedom in the North and became a prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], on his first visit to England.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], ''[[Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution]]'', New York: HarperCollins, 2006 Pbk, p. 420.</ref> Douglass spoke at numerous meetings and attracted considerable attention and support. At risk after passage in the US of the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]], Douglass was grateful when British friends raised the money and negotiated purchase of his freedom from his former master.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Clarkson Memorial cropped.jpg|150px|thumb|The [[Clarkson Memorial]], Wisbech]]\nThroughout his life Clarkson was a frequent guest of [[Joseph Hardcastle (1752\u20131818)|Joseph Hardcastle]] (the first treasurer of the [[London Missionary Society]]) at Hatcham House in [[Deptford]]. Then a rural [[Surrey]] village, it is now part of inner London. Here in the early 1790s he met his wife, a niece of Mrs Hardcastle. Here Clarkson wrote much of his ''History of the Abolition of the Slave Trade'' (1808).\n\nThomas was not the only notable member of his family. His younger brother [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|John Clarkson]] (1764\u20131828) at the age of 28 took a major part in organising and co-ordinating the relocation of approximately 1200 [[Black Loyalists]] to Africa in early 1792. They were among the 3000 United States ex-slaves given their freedom by the British and granted land in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. This group chose to go to the new colony of [[Sierra Leone]] founded by the British in West Africa, founding [[Freetown]].\n\nJohn Clarkson was appointed as its first Governor and helped the settlers survive terrible conditions in the first year. He also aided the settlers in their goal of political independence, which was more than the Sierra Leone commercial company wanted, and they forced him to resign. John Clarkson died in 1828 in [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]], and was buried in St Mary's churchyard.\n\nThomas Clarkson died on 26 September 1846 in [[Playford, Suffolk]].<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5545 Hugh Brogan's biography of Clarkson]. (May require log in)</ref> He was buried in the village on 2 October at St Mary's Church.\n\nThe Clarkson chest and Clarkson Collection are now on display in [[Wisbech & Fenland Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=\nhttps://www.wisbechmuseum.org.uk/clarkson/index.php|title=Clarkson Collection|website=wisbechmuseum.org.uk|accessdate= 12 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:CllarksonGrave.JPG|thumb|Clarkson's grave]]\n*In 1834, after the abolition of slavery in Jamaica, Free Villages were founded for the settlement of freedmen. The town of Clarksonville, named in his honour, was established in St. Ann, Jamaica.\n*In 1839 a mission station in South Africa was named Clarkson by Moravian missionary H.P. Hallbeck in honour of Clarkson and his abolition work. https://www.sahistory.org.za/places/clarkson \n*In 1857, an obelisk commemorating Clarkson was erected in St. Mary's churchyard.\n*In 1879, a monument to Clarkson was erected in Wadesmill; it reads: \"On this spot where stands this monument in the month of June 1785 Thomas Clarkson resolved to devote his life to bringing about the abolition of the slave trade.\"<ref>{{NHLE |desc=Clarkson monument on High Cross Hill |num=1281321 |accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n*The [[Clarkson Memorial]] was erected in his birthplace of Wisbech to commemorate his life and work.

He helped found The [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] (also known as the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade) and helped achieve passage of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] of 1807, which ended British trade in slaves.\n\nIn his later years Clarkson campaigned for the abolition of slavery worldwide; it was then concentrated in the Americas. In 1840, he was the key speaker at the [[Anti-Slavery Society]]'s (today known as [[Anti-Slavery International]]) first conference in London, England which campaigned to end slavery in other countries.\n\n==Early life and education==\nClarkson was the eldest son of Rev. John Clarkson (1710\u20131766), an Anglican priest and curate of [[Walsoken]], [[Norfolk]]. He was baptised on 26 May 1760.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.wisbechmuseum.org.uk/blog/post.php?s=2019-12-19-first-museum-job-and-parish-registers|title=parish registers|website=wisbechmiseum.org|accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref>\nHis brother John was born on 4 April 1764. They had a sister Anne.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Clarksons of Wisbech|author=Ellen Gibson Wilson|publisher=Wisbech Society|year=1992}}</ref> Both boys attended [[Wisbech Grammar School]], Hill Street where the family lived and their father was headmaster; Thomas went on to [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London in 1775. He did his undergraduate work at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], beginning in 1779.<ref>{{acad|id=CLRK779T2|name=Clarkson, Thomas}}</ref> An excellent student, he appears to have enjoyed his time at university, although he was also a serious, devout man. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in 1783 and was set to continue at Cambridge to follow in his father's footsteps and enter the [[Anglican Church]]. He was ordained a [[deacon#Anglicanism|deacon]] but never proceeded to priest's orders.\n\n==Revelation of the horrors of slavery==\nIt was at Cambridge in 1785 that Clarkson entered a [[Latin]] essay competition that was to set him on the course for most of the remainder of his life. The topic of the essay, set by university vice-chancellor [[Peter Peckard]], was ''Anne liceat invitos in servitutem dare'' (\"Is it lawful to enslave the unconsenting?\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0275%2FClarkson|title=Janus: Papers of Thomas Clarkson|publisher=University of Cambridge}}</ref> and it led Clarkson to consider the question of the [[slave trade]]. He read everything he could on the subject, including the works of [[Anthony Benezet]], a [[Quaker]] [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], as well as first hand accounts of the African slave trade such as [[Francis Moore (geographer)|Francis Moore's]] ''Travels into the Interior Parts of Africa''. He also researched the topic by meeting and interviewing those who had personal experience of the slave trade and of slavery.\n\nAfter winning the prize, Clarkson had what he called a spiritual revelation from God as he travelled by horseback between [[Cambridge]] and London. He broke up his journey at [[Wadesmill]], near [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], Hertfordshire. He later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>As it is usual to read these essays publicly in the senate-house soon after the prize is adjudged, I was called to Cambridge for this purpose. I went and performed my office. On returning however to London, the subject of it almost wholly engrossed my thoughts. I became at times very seriously affected while upon the road. I stopped my horse occasionally, and dismounted and walked. I frequently tried to persuade myself in these intervals that the contents of my Essay could not be true. The more however I reflected upon them, or rather upon the authorities on which they were founded, the more I gave them credit. Coming in sight of Wades Mill in Hertfordshire, I sat down disconsolate on the turf by the roadside and held my horse. Here a thought came into my mind, that if the contents of the Essay were true, it was time some person should see these calamities to their end. Agitated in this manner I reached home. This was in the summer of 1785.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clarkson\n|first=Thomas\n|authorlink=Thomas Clarkson\n|date=1808\n|volume=1\n|title=The History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave-Trade by the British Parliament|publisher=[[Longman, Hurst, Rees and Orme]]\n|location=London\n|pages=209&ndash;210\n|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/12428/pg12428-images.html}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis experience and sense of calling ultimately led him to devote his life to abolishing the slave trade.\n\nHaving translated the essay into English so that it could gain a wider audience, Clarkson published it in pamphlet-form in 1786 as ''An essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species, particularly the African, translated from a Latin Dissertation.'' It was honoured with the first prize in the University of Cambridge, for the year 1785.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10611\n|title=An Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species, Particularly the African.

These included influential men such as [[James Ramsay (abolitionist)|James Ramsay]] and [[Granville Sharp]], many Quakers, and other [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]]s. The movement had been gathering strength for some years, having been founded by [[Quakers]] both in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and in the United States, with support from other nonconformists, primarily Methodists and Baptists, on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1783, 300 Quakers, chiefly from the London area, presented [[British Parliament|Parliament]] with their signatures on the first petition against the slave trade.\n\nFollowing this step, a small offshoot group formed the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]], a small non-denominational group that could lobby more successfully by incorporating Anglicans, who sat in Parliament. (Quakers were barred from Parliament until the early nineteenth century, whereas clergy of the Anglican Church had the right to seats in the House of Lords). The twelve founding members included nine Quakers, and three pioneering Anglicans: Clarkson, [[Granville Sharp]], and Philip Sansom. They were sympathetic to the religious revival that had predominantly nonconformist origins, but which sought wider non-denominational support for a \"Great Awakening\" amongst believers.\n\n==Anti-slavery campaign==\nEncouraged by publication of Clarkson's essay, an informal committee was set up between small groups from the petitioning Quakers, Clarkson and others, with the goal of lobbying members of parliament (MPs). In May 1787, they formed the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]]. The Committee included [[Granville Sharp]] as chairman and [[Josiah Wedgwood]], as well as Clarkson. Clarkson also approached the young [[William Wilberforce]], who as an Anglican and an MP was connected within the British Parliament. Wilberforce was one of few parliamentarians to have had sympathy with the Quaker petition; he had already put a question about the slave trade before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and became known as one of the earliest Anglican abolitionists.\n\nClarkson took a leading part in the affairs of the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]], and was tasked to collect evidence to support the abolition of the slave trade. He faced much opposition from supporters of the trade in some of the cities he visited. The slave traders were an influential group because the trade was a legitimate and highly lucrative business, generating prosperity for many of the ports.\n\n[[Liverpool]] was a major base of slave trading syndicates and home port for their ships. In 1787, Clarkson was attacked and nearly killed when visiting the city, as a gang of sailors was paid to assassinate him. He barely escaped with his life. Elsewhere, however, he gathered support. Clarkson's speech at the collegiate church in Manchester (now [[Manchester Cathedral]]) on 28 October 1787 galvanised the anti-slavery campaign in the city. That same year, Clarkson published the pamphlet ''A Summary View of the Slave Trade and of the Probable Consequences of Its Abolition''.\n\nClarkson was very effective at giving the Committee a high public profile: he spent the next two years travelling around England, promoting the cause and gathering evidence. He interviewed 20,000 sailors during his research. He obtained equipment used on slave-ships, such as iron handcuffs, leg-shackles, and [[thumbscrew (torture)|thumbscrews]]; instruments for forcing open slaves' jaws; and branding irons. He published engravings of the tools in pamphlets and displayed the instruments at public meetings.\n\n[[File:Seven Stars Bristol.jpg|thumb|Clarkson visited [[Seven Stars Public House, Bristol|The Seven Stars]] in Bristol for research.]]\nClarkson's research took him to English ports such as [[Bristol]], where he received much data from the landlord of the [[Seven Stars Public House, Bristol|Seven Stars pub]]. (The building still stands in Thomas Lane.) He also travelled repeatedly to [[Liverpool]] and London, collecting vital evidence to support the abolitionist case.<ref name=\"collecting\"/>\n\nClarkson visited ''The Lively,'' an African trading ship. Although not a slave ship, it carried cargo of high quality goods: [[carved ivory]] and [[woven textiles]], [[beeswax]], and produce such as [[palm oil]] and [[Capsicum|peppers]]. Impressed by the high quality of craftsmanship and skill expressed in these items, Clarkson was horrified to think that the people who could create such items were being enslaved. He bought samples from the ship and started a collection to which he added over the years. It included crops, spices and [[raw material]]s, along with refined trade goods.<ref name=\"abolition\"/>\n  \t\t  \t\t\nClarkson noticed that pictures and artefacts could influence public opinion more than words alone. He began to display items from his collection of fine goods to reinforce his anti-slavery lectures. Demonstrating that Africans were highly skilled artisans, he argued for an alternative humane trading system based on goods rather than labourers. He carried a \"box\" featuring his collection, which became an important part his public meetings. It was an early example of a visual aid.<ref name=\"abolition\">[http://abolition.e2bn.org/box.html Home: \"Thomas Clarkson\"], Abolition Project website. Retrieved 28 September 2014.</ref>\n\nHe rode by horseback some 35,000&nbsp;miles for evidence and visited local anti-slave trade societies founded across the country. He enlisted the help of [[Alexander Falconbridge]] and James Arnold, two ship's surgeons whom he met in Liverpool. They had been on many voyages aboard slave ships, and were able to recount their experiences in detail for publication.<ref name=\"collecting\">[http://abolition.e2bn.org/box_58.html \"Thomas Clarkson: Collecting Evidence\"], The Abolition Project website. Retrieved 28 September 2014.</ref>\n\nClarkson also continued to write against the slave trade. He filled his works with vivid firsthand descriptions from sailors, surgeons and others who had been involved in the slave traffic. In 1788 Clarkson published large numbers of his ''Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade'' (1788). Another example was his \"An Essay on the Slave Trade\" (1789), the account of a sailor who had served aboard a slave ship. These works provided a grounding for William Wilberforce's first abolitionist speech in the House of Commons on 12 May 1789, and his 12 propositions.\n\n[[Olaudah Equiano]] (Gustavus Vassa) a member of the [[Sons of Africa]] published his memoir, one of the genre of what became known as [[slave narratives]] \u2013 accounts by slaves who achieved freedom. As an African with direct experience of the slave trade and slavery, Equiano was pleased that his book became highly influential in the anti-slavery movement. Clarkson wrote to the Rev. Mr. Jones at [[Trinity College (Cambridge)|Trinity College]], to introduce Equiano to him and the community. He asked for aid from the Rev. Jones in selling copies of the memoir and arranging for Equiano to visit Cambridge to lecture.\n\nIn 1791 Wilberforce introduced the first Bill to abolish the slave trade; it was easily defeated by 163 votes to 88. As Wilberforce continued to bring the issue of the slave trade before Parliament, Clarkson travelled and wrote anti-slavery works. Based on a plan of a slave ship he acquired in Portsmouth, he had an image drawn of slaves loaded on the slave ship ''Brookes;'' he published this in London in 1791, took the image with him on lectures, and provided it to Wilberforce with other anti-slave trade materials for use in parliament.<ref name=\"diagram\">[http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/asset72540_1315-abolition.html \"Brookes' Diagram-Clarkson's Box\"], The Abolition Project, 2009. Retrieved 28 September 2014</ref> (See image \"Brookes' Diagram-Clarkson's Box\", The Abolition Project, 2009.)\n[[File:Thomas Clarkson, 1760-1846 RMG E9112.tiff|thumb|left|Portrait of Clarkson, circa 1840]]\nThis was the beginning of their protracted parliamentary campaign, during which Wilberforce introduced a motion in favour of abolition almost every year. Clarkson, Wilberforce and the other members of the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] and their supporters, were responsible for generating and sustaining a national movement that mobilised public opinion as never before. Parliament, however, refused to pass the bill. The outbreak of [[Napoleonic Wars|War with France]] effectively prevented further debate for many years.\n\nBy 1794, Clarkson's health was failing, as he suffered from exhaustion. He retired from the campaign and spent some time in the [[Lake District]], where he bought an estate at [[Ullswater]]. There he became a friend of the poet [[William Wordsworth]].\n\nIn January 1796 he married Catherine Buck of [[Bury St Edmunds]], Suffolk; their only child Thomas was born in 1796. They moved back to the south of England for the sake of Catherine's health, and settled at [[Bury St Edmunds]] from 1806 to 1816. Next they lived at Playford Hall, located halfway between [[Ipswich]] and [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]].\n\nWhen the war with France appeared to be almost over, in 1804 Clarkson and his allies revived the anti-slave trade campaign. After his ten years' retreat, he mounted his horse to travel again all over Great Britain and canvass support for the measure. He appeared to have returned with all his old enthusiasm and vigour. He was especially active in persuading MPs to back the parliamentary campaign.\n\nPassage of the [[Slave Trade Act]] in 1807 ended the trade and provided for British naval support to enforce the law. Clarkson directed his efforts toward enforcement and extending the campaign to the rest of Europe, as Spain and France continued a trade in their American colonies. The United States also prohibited the international trade in 1807, and operated chiefly in the Caribbean to interdict illegal slave ships. In 1808 Clarkson published a book about the progress in abolition of the slave trade.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarkson|first=Thomas|title=The History of the Rise, Progress And Accomplishment of the Abolition of the Slave \u2013 Trade by the British Parliament|year=1808|publisher=James P. Parke|location=Philadelphia}}</ref> He travelled to Paris in 1814 and [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1818, trying to reach international agreement on a timetable for abolition of the trade.  He contributed the article on the \"Slave Trade\" for ''[[Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia]],'' Vol. 33, 1816.\n\n==Later career==\n{{Anti-Slavery Society Convention 1840|align=right|size=250px|caption=Clarkson is the central figure in this painting which is of the 1840 Anti-Slavery Convention.<ref name=npg>[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?search=ap&npgno=599&eDate=&lDate= The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840], [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]], 1841, [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], London, NPG599, Given by [[Anti-Slavery International|British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]] in 1880</ref> <small>Move your cursor to identify his relatives and the great and good (or click icon to enlarge).</small>}} \nIn 1823 the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery (later known as the [[Anti-Slavery Society]]) was formed. Clarkson travelled the country to build support for its goal. He covered 10,000&nbsp;miles, and activated the network of sympathetic anti-slavery societies which had been formed. This resulted in 777 petitions being delivered to parliament demanding the total emancipation of slaves. When the society adopted a policy of immediate emancipation, Clarkson and Wilberforce appeared together for the last time to lend their support. In 1833 the [[Slavery Abolition Act]] was passed, with emancipation to be completed by 1838 in the British colonies.\n\nClarkson lived an additional 13&nbsp;years. Although his eyesight was failing, he continued to campaign for abolition, focusing on the United States, where slavery had expanded in the Deep South and some states west of the Mississippi River. He was the principal speaker in 1840 at the opening of the first [[World's Anti-Slavery Convention]] in [[Freemasons' Hall, London|Freemasons' Hall]], London, chaired by [[Thomas Binney]]. The conference was designed to build support for abolishing slavery worldwide and included delegates from France, the USA, [[Haiti]] (established in 1804 as the first black republic in the Western Hemisphere) and [[Jamaica]].\n\nThe scene at Clarkson's opening address was painted in a commemorative work, now in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]], London. The emancipated slave, [[Henry Beckford]] (a Baptist deacon in Jamaica), is shown in the right foreground. Clarkson and the prominent abolitionist Quaker [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]] were to the left, the main axis of interest. In 1846 Clarkson was host to [[Frederick Douglass]], an American former slave who had escaped to freedom in the North and became a prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], on his first visit to England.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], ''[[Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution]]'', New York: HarperCollins, 2006 Pbk, p. 420.</ref> Douglass spoke at numerous meetings and attracted considerable attention and support. At risk after passage in the US of the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]], Douglass was grateful when British friends raised the money and negotiated purchase of his freedom from his former master.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Clarkson Memorial cropped.jpg|150px|thumb|The [[Clarkson Memorial]], Wisbech]]\nThroughout his life Clarkson was a frequent guest of [[Joseph Hardcastle (1752\u20131818)|Joseph Hardcastle]] (the first treasurer of the [[London Missionary Society]]) at Hatcham House in [[Deptford]]. Then a rural [[Surrey]] village, it is now part of inner London. Here in the early 1790s he met his wife, a niece of Mrs Hardcastle. Here Clarkson wrote much of his ''History of the Abolition of the Slave Trade'' (1808).\n\nThomas was not the only notable member of his family. His younger brother [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|John Clarkson]] (1764\u20131828) at age 28 took a major part in organising and co-ordinating the relocation of approximately 1200 [[Black Loyalists]] to Africa in early 1792. They were among the 3000 United States ex-slaves given their freedom by the British and granted land in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. This group chose to go to the new colony of [[Sierra Leone]] founded by the British in West Africa, founding [[Freetown]].\n\nJohn Clarkson was appointed as its first Governor and helped the settlers survive terrible conditions in the first year. He also aided the settlers in their goal of political independence, which was more than the Sierra Leone commercial company wanted, and they forced him to resign. John Clarkson died in 1828 in [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]], and was buried in St Mary's churchyard.\n\nThomas Clarkson died on 26 September 1846 in [[Playford, Suffolk]].<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5545 Hugh Brogan's biography of Clarkson]. (May require log in)</ref> He was buried in the village on 2 October at St Mary's Church.\n\nThe Clarkson chest and Clarkson Collection are now on display in [[Wisbech & Fenland Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=\nhttps://www.wisbechmuseum.org.uk/clarkson/index.php|title=Clarkson Collection|website=wisbechmuseum.org.uk|accessdate= 12 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:CllarksonGrave.JPG|thumb|Clarkson's grave]]\n*In 1834, after the abolition of slavery in Jamaica, Free Villages were founded for the settlement of freedmen. The town of Clarksonville, named in his honour, was established in St. Ann, Jamaica.\n*In 1839 a mission station in South Africa was named Clarkson by Moravian missionary H.P. Hallbeck in honour of Clarkson and his abolition work. https://www.sahistory.org.za/places/clarkson \n*In 1857, an obelisk commemorating Clarkson was erected in St. Mary's churchyard.\n*In 1879, a monument to Clarkson was erected in Wadesmill; it reads: \"On this spot where stands this monument in the month of June 1785 Thomas Clarkson resolved to devote his life to bringing about the abolition of the slave trade.\"<ref>{{NHLE |desc=Clarkson monument on High Cross Hill |num=1281321 |accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n*The [[Clarkson Memorial]] was erected in his birthplace of Wisbech to commemorate his life and work.

The open fronted 10 bed wards, orientated north and east, were designed to maximize patient fresh air and sunlight.
