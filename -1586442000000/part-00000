One fateful encounter brings her standing against Bollywood superstar Rishabh Kundra alias RK. She fights a case of hit and run on behalf of her friend Mukund against RK and sends him to jail. \n\nMukund proposes Madhu and they get engaged. RK insinuates that Madhu is his girlfriend and humiliates her mother Padmini and guardian Shamsher Malik\u2019s relationship. He says they are having a secret affair for last 20 years. Mukund breaks off his engagement thinking Madhu has an affair with RK.\n\nMadhu visits RK\u2019s set and slaps him who puts forward an offer of forty lakh rupees for her father Balraj\u2019s treatment as he was badly beaten up on RK\u2019s set after he had showed up to kill RK after a public stunt. RK asks Madhu to marry him which she accepts. Rude and egotistical, RK becomes hell-bent on ruining Madhubala\u2019s life and tries to insult her in any way he can but is possessive of her.\n\nEventually, things turn normal and Madhu falls in love with RK. RK's half-brother Sikandar Bhatia's wife Deepali, who is in fact RK's ex-girlfriend had married Sikandar as he was being launched in a big-budgeted film and RK was a struggling actor at that time. She wants Madhu to leave RK but in vain. \n\nShamsher is determined to kill RK who had forcefully kept Madhu captive at his home. Unaware of the changed scenario, he shoots RK who is saved by Madhu as she donates blood to him. She witnesses a big change in her feelings for RK who too develops a soft corner for Madhu and is no longer rude to her. She brings a lot of changes in RK\u2019s life like she restores his faith in God and his relationship with his mother. \n\nMadhu teaches RK many other lessons of life and everyone is thankful to her for this. They confess their love. RK helps Padmini and Shamsher in getting married and even when Balraj abducts all but is shot to death by Padmini. RK asks Madhu to leave her family and come away with him to lead a peaceful life because he needs a break and wants to spend his time with her. \n\nMadhu blindly agrees and RK says he wants to marry her properly before leaving so that they can take their relationship forward. During the marriage, RK suddenly stops and tells he had never loved her; it was his plan to entangle her in his love and then destroy her life when he leaves him. \n\nDevastated, Madhu decides to part her ways. Everyone is furious at RK for deserting Madhu and tries to convince him to bring her back as he is nothing without her but he doesn\u2019t budge on his decision. Madhu gets job as a hairstylist at RK\u2019s film set. He is once again rude to her and adamant to make her leave, trying to play hard but she has answers. \n\nRK regrets his decision to leave Madhu when he suspects her getting ahead with a mysterious man. He cannot stand the thought of Madhu with someone else and realizes his mistake; he decides to win her back and abducts her to forcefully make her live with him at his home. Earlier, Madhu not relents.\n\nLater, Madhu decides to play along and this time she would leave RK with help from Sultan, the mystery man who RK assumes to be Madhu's lover. She wants to teach RK a lesson and make him realize the pain of a broken heart. He is unable to accept his feelings for Madhu. Wanting her plan to succeed, Madhu leaves saying she won't comeback unless he confesses his love. \n\nAs per Madhu's expectations, RK confesses his love and proposes her in front of all. Madhu agrees and the preparation for the grand wedding begins. Just a few days before the wedding, Madhu realizes she cannot execute her plan because she loves RK and cannot leave him. Sultan wants Madhu to back off because he thinks that RK will kill Madhu when he learns her evil plan.\n\nMadhu changes her mind and breaks Sultan's heart as he loves her too. Although heartbroken after learning Madhu\u2019s plan, RK decides to leave all the bad memories behind, forgive Madhubala and then officially marry her. Sultan, who hates RK for taking away Madhu, seeks revenge. He discovers being RK\u2019s half-brother and uses this as a device to humiliate him in public.\n\nSultan refers RK as a bastard whose father Mohan had first married Meera who gave birth to Sultan. RK realizes Sultan is doing all this to win Madhu and accidentally kills him. He is sent to jail. Madhu finds out Sultan is alive and it was a plan to send RK to jail and take her away. \n\nSultan realizes RK wouldn\u2019t so easily let Madhu go and now so on tortures her to get a divorce from RK and come to him in order to save him. Helpless, Madhu agrees. Enraged, RK refuses but later connects all dots and learns that it is Sultan who is behind all this drama and forcing Madhu to divorce him. \n\nRK eventually kills Sultan with the police's help and saves Madhu. Due to his inability to shoot for movies owing to personal problems and slapping producer Amar Bahl, RK is banned from Bollywood and decides to produce his own film. Veteran director Mehul Chopra agrees to help him ans chooses Madhu as the heroine but RK refuses and is actually fascinated by the idea of her being his heroine. \n\nRK finds a heroine but is dissatisfied and vows not to pressurize Madhu to sign the film. On inauguration day, the heroine is rendered unable to attend the inaugural conference by Amar Bahl and RK's stepfather Kulbhushan Bhatia who hates him. Thinking that his career is over, RK is about to commit suicide when his assistant Bittu Sharma calls and informs him Madhu has stepped in as the heroine. \n\nSuper excited, RK appears as leading actor of his film in front of media with Madhu who marks her entry into Bollywood. He confesses in front of all that he loves Madhu and thanks to her for becoming his heroine. RK\u2019s aunt Paabo is told by a saint that Madhu is not right for him. Madhu is brainwashed by Paabo and made to perform some perilous religious tasks but later finds out it was all Paabo and Deepali\u2019s plot to oust her from RK\u2019s life.\n\nMadhu refuses to leave RK. During shooting, RK gets injured and suffers paralysis. Madhu decides to take over and complete the movie. RK develops insecurity towards her due to her rising fame and being ignored by everyone because he is handicapped. Madhu becomes pregnant but RK doesn\u2019t want a baby when he is going through a lot of trouble. This breaks Madhu\u2019s heart and she is unhappy with his wishes. \n\nThe movie \u201cIshq Ek Junoon\u201d becomes a superhit, bringing RK out of his financial and career problems. Due to stress, Madhu suffers miscarriage and blames RK. He misunderstands her thought of becoming a superstar like him and tries his best to avert her mind from getting into the film industry. Later, everything gets all right and Madhu becomes a heroine like she was destined to be.\n\nEnters RK's doppelganger Keval Ram Kushwaha alias KRK, who is hired by Kulbhushan to avenge all the insults RK had thrown at him. Kulbhushan wants KRK to steal away all RK\u2019s money and render him bankrupt. KRK agrees to take RK\u2019s place in need of money. He is a nobleman and decides to leave RK\u2019s life when he realizes of separating him from Madhu.\n\nKRK returns back to his hometown with prize money from RK for speaking up the truth and showing decency. Kulbhushan is arrested and sent to jail. Madhu is revealed to be pregnant once again and gives birth to a girl whom RK also names Madhubala. He prophesies that she will become a superstar like her parents.\n\n===Twenty years later===\n\nRK and Madhu are dead. Their grown-up daughter Madhubala looks like just Madhu and works for Abhay Kapoor who makes her fall in love with him. They announce their marriage, but Abhay gets Madhubala married to Raja, a mentally challenged and second look-alike of RK. Abhay reveals he wanted to avenge death of his father Harshvardhan who committed suicide after being incriminated for killing RK and Madhu. \n\nRaja turns out to be KRK's son and finally becomes a normal person. Due to his lifestyle of a gangster, Madhubala hates, insults and accuses him by crossing her all limits. She raises question on his manhood. Angry, dejected and drunk, Raja gets doped and instigated by his brother-in-law who tells him to punish Madhubala for unnecessarily raising questions.\n\nThis leads to the raging Raja raping Madhubala who files a case against him and gets him jailed but withdraws it after some time. Raja\u2019s aunt Baiji dies. Being in jail and unable to donate blood to save her life, he thinks Madhubala is responsible for it and begins hating and torturing her. It is revealed Raja's brother-in-law plotted this to take over the family property.\n\nMadhubala gets pregnant with Raja's child and later requests him to forgive her which Raja does; they remarry and begin living separately from his family. Raja opens a garage to start earning living. One night, a producer assumes him as RK and proposes to do a film with him that the producer had wanted to do with RK and Madhu. \n\nMadhubala reads Madhu\u2019s diary, learning that Madhu\u2019s last wish was to make a film on her and RK\u2019s life. Madhubala convinces Raja to sign the film; they start their career and appear as Madhu and RK, giving the first shot of their film. Raja states it is not the end but beginning of a new life as they were always destined to live and be superstars together.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Drashti Dhami]] as\n** Madhubala \"Madhu\" Choudhary\u2013 Padmini and Balraj's daughter, Trishna's sister, RK's wife, Madhubala's mother (2012\u20132014)\n** Madhubala Kundra\u2013 Madhu and RK's daughter, Raja's wife (2014)\n* [[Vivian Dsena]] as\n** Rishabh Kundra/ RK\u2013 Radha and Mohan's son, Meera and Kulbhushan's stepson, Sultan and Sikandar's half-brother, Madhu's husband, Madhubala's father (2012\u20132014)\n** Keval Ram Kushwaha/ KRK\u2013 Jugnu's brother, Kulbhushan's accomplice, Abhimanyu and Raja's father (2013\u20132014)\n** Raja Kushwaha/ Ram Kumar/ Raju\u2013 KRK's son, Abhimanyu's brother, Madhubala's husband (2014)\n* [[Spandan Chaturvedi]] as Young Madhubala Kundra (2014)\n===Recurring=== \n* [[Pallavi Purohit]] as Padmini Shekhari\u2013 Balraj's ex-wife, Madhu and Trishna's mother, Shamsher's wife, Madhubala's maternal grandmother\n* [[Aarti Puri]] as Trishna Chaudhary\u2013 Padmini and Balraj's daughter, Madhu's sister, Madhubala's sororal aunt\n* Shama Deshpande as Radha Upadhyay\u2013 Mohan's widowed/second wife, Kulbhushan's wife, RK and Sikandar's mother, Madhubala's paternal grandmother\n* [[Raza Murad]] as Kulbhushan Bhatia/ Kukku\u2013 Radha's second husband, RK's stepfather, Sikandar's father\n* [[Sikandar Kharbanda]] as Sikandar Bhatia\u2013 Radha and Kulbhushan's son, RK's half-brother, Deepali's husband\n* Seema Mishra as Deepali Singh\u2013 RK's ex-girlfriend, Sikandar's wife\n* [[Navneet Nishan]]/Seema Kapoor as Pabbo\u2013 RK's paternal aunt\n* [[Avinesh Rekhi]] as Sultan Kundra\u2013 Meera and Mohan's son, RK's half-brother, Madhu's obsessive lover\n* [[Siddharth Vasudev]] as Bhujang Shastri\n* [[Zarina Wahab]] as Meera Malik\u2013 Mohan's ex-wife, Sultan's mother\n* Kannan Arunachalam as Rashid Baig\u2013 Mohan's ex-driver\n* [[Raj Zutshi]] as Balraj Choudhary\u2013 Padmini's ex-husband, Madhu and Trishna's father, Madhubala's maternal grandfather\n* [[Shagufta Ali]] as Badi Chaudhrain\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Guruji\n* [[Sushmita Mukherjee]] as Dai Maa\n* Indresh Malik as Bittu Sharma\u2013 RK's personal secretary, Leela's husband\n* [[Rakhee Tandon (actress)|Rakhee Tandon]] as Roma Malik\u2013 Shamsher's sister,\n* [[Bhupinder Singh (actor)|Bhupinder Singh]] as Shamsher Malik\u2013 Padmini's second husband, Madhu and Trishna's stepfather\n* [[Prashant Chawla]] as Sunny Sharma\n* Swati Anand as Leelavati Agashey/ Leela\u2013 Bittu's wife\n* Shweta Vyal/[[Tanvi Thakkar]] as Sweety Sharma\n* [[Vaishnavi Dhanraj]] as Riya\n* [[Manini Mishra]] as Ila\n* [[Usha Nadkarni]] as Sonali Devi\n* [[Manish Naggdev]] as Mukund Dixit\n* [[Ahsaas Channa]] as Swati Dixit\n* [[Anita Hassanandani]] as Sanya \n* [[Vinay Apte]] as Shivdutt Marathe \n* [[Neelu Kohli]] as Harjeet Kaur/Bebe\n* [[Arbaaz Ali Khan]] as [[Director]] Harshvardhan \"Harsh\" Kapoor\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Mohini Verma\n* Puneet Sachdev as Nikhil Lamba\n* [[Kishwer Merchant]] as Ananya Prakash\n* Gunjan Utreja as Abhay Kapoor\n* Rajesh Balwani as Lakhan Kapoor\n* [[Utkarsha Naik]] as Dolly Kaur Singh\n* [[Fenil Umrigar]] as Aisha Dande\n* Ravi Khanvilkar as Jugnesh Ram Kushwaha/ Jugnu\n* [[Shoaib Ibrahim]] as Abhimanyu Kushwaha\n* [[Shraddha Jaiswal]] as Agni\n* [[Shalini Arora]]/[[Jaya Bhattacharya]] as Baiji Devi\n* [[Shital Thakkar]] as Tara\n* Jaswant Menaria as Bhanu Pratap Singh\n* Pooja Sahu as Faguni Kushwaha\n* [[Neha Pendse]] as Priya\n\n==Broadcast==\n\nIt was dubbed into [[Telugu Language|Telugu]] as ''Madhubala- O Prema O Paga'' telecasted on [[Gemini TV]].\n\nThe theme song \"Hum Hai Deewane\" and \"Ishq Tu Hi Hai Mera\" was composed by [[Shalin Sharma]], while \"Ishq Hai\" was composed by Saurabh Kalsi.

During the marriage, RK suddenly stops and tells he had never loved her; it was his plan to entangle her in his love and then destroy her life when he leaves him. \n\nDevastated, Madhu decides to part her ways. Everyone is furious at RK for deserting Madhu and tries to convince him to bring her back as he is nothing without her but he doesn\u2019t budge on his decision. Madhu gets job as a hairstylist at RK\u2019s film set. He is once again rude to her and adamant to make her leave, trying to play hard but she has answers. \n\nRK regrets his decision to leave Madhu when he suspects her getting ahead with a mysterious man. He cannot stand the thought of Madhu with someone else and realizes his mistake; he decides to win her back and abducts her to forcefully make her live with him at his home. Earlier, Madhu not relents.\n\nLater, Madhu decides to play along and this time she would leave RK with help from Sultan, the mystery man who RK assumes to be Madhu's lover. She wants to teach RK a lesson and make him realize the pain of a broken heart. He is unable to accept his feelings for Madhu. Wanting her plan to succeed, Madhu leaves saying she won't comeback unless he confesses his love. \n\nAs per Madhu's expectations, RK confesses his love and proposes her in front of all. Madhu agrees and the preparation for the grand wedding begins. Just a few days before the wedding, Madhu realizes she cannot execute her plan because she loves RK and cannot leave him. Sultan wants Madhu to back off because he thinks that RK will kill Madhu when he learns her evil plan.\n\nMadhu changes her mind and breaks Sultan's heart as he loves her too. Although heartbroken after learning Madhu\u2019s plan, RK decides to leave all the bad memories behind, forgive Madhubala and then officially marry her. Sultan, who hates RK for taking away Madhu, seeks revenge. He discovers being RK\u2019s half-brother and uses this as a device to humiliate him in public.\n\nSultan refers RK as a bastard whose father Mohan had first married Meera who gave birth to Sultan. RK realizes Sultan is doing all this to win Madhu and accidentally kills him. He is sent to jail. Madhu finds out Sultan is alive and it was a plan to send RK to jail and take her away. \n\nSultan realizes RK wouldn\u2019t so easily let Madhu go and now so on tortures her to get a divorce from RK and come to him in order to save him. Helpless, Madhu agrees. Enraged, RK refuses but later connects all dots and learns that it is Sultan who is behind all this drama and forcing Madhu to divorce him. \n\nRK eventually kills Sultan with the police's help and saves Madhu. Due to his inability to shoot for movies owing to personal problems and slapping producer Amar Bahl, RK is banned from Bollywood and decides to produce his own film. Veteran director Mehul Chopra agrees to help him ans chooses Madhu as the heroine but RK refuses and is actually fascinated by the idea of her being his heroine. \n\nRK finds a heroine but is dissatisfied and vows not to pressurize Madhu to sign the film. On inauguration day, the heroine is rendered unable to attend the inaugural conference by Amar Bahl and RK's stepfather Kulbhushan Bhatia who hates him. Thinking that his career is over, RK is about to commit suicide when his assistant Bittu Sharma calls and informs him Madhu has stepped in as the heroine. \n\nSuper excited, RK appears as leading actor of his film in front of media with Madhu who marks her entry into Bollywood. He confesses in front of all that he loves Madhu and thanks to her for becoming his heroine. RK\u2019s aunt Paabo is told by a saint that Madhu is not right for him. Madhu is brainwashed by Paabo and made to perform some perilous religious tasks but later finds out it was all Paabo and Deepali\u2019s plot to oust her from RK\u2019s life.\n\nMadhu refuses to leave RK. During shooting, RK gets injured and suffers paralysis. Madhu decides to take over and complete the movie. RK develops insecurity towards her due to her rising fame and being ignored by everyone because he is handicapped. Madhu becomes pregnant but RK doesn\u2019t want a baby when he is going through a lot of trouble. This breaks Madhu\u2019s heart and she is unhappy with his wishes. \n\nThe movie \u201cIshq Ek Junoon\u201d becomes a superhit, bringing RK out of his financial and career problems. Due to stress, Madhu suffers miscarriage and blames RK. He misunderstands her thought of becoming a superstar like him and tries his best to avert her mind from getting into the film industry. Later, everything gets all right and Madhu becomes a heroine like she was destined to be.\n\nEnters RK's doppelganger Keval Ram Kushwaha alias KRK, who who is hired by Kulbhushan to avenge all the insults RK had thrown at him. Kulbhushan wants KRK to steal away all RK\u2019s money and render him bankrupt. KRK agrees to take RK\u2019s place in need of money. He is a nobleman and decides to leave RK\u2019s life when he realizes of separating him from Madhu.\n\nKRK returns back to his hometown with prize money from RK for speaking up the truth and showing decency. Kulbhushan is arrested and sent to jail. Madhu is revealed to be pregnant once again and gives birth to a girl whom RK also names Madhubala. He prophesies that she will become a superstar like her parents.\n\n===Twenty years later===\n\nRK and Madhu are dead. Their grown-up daughter Madhubala looks like just Madhu and works for Abhay Kapoor who makes her fall in love with him. They announce their marriage, but Abhay gets Madhubala married to Raja, a mentally challenged and second look-alike of RK. Abhay reveals he wanted to avenge death of his father Harshvardhan who committed suicide after being incriminated for killing RK and Madhu. \n\nRaja turns out to be KRK's son and finally becomes a normal person. Due to his lifestyle of a gangster, Madhubala hates, insults and accuses him by crossing her all limits. She raises question on his manhood. Angry, dejected and drunk, Raja gets doped and instigated by his brother-in-law who tells him to punish Madhubala for unnecessarily raising questions.\n\nThis leads to the raging Raja raping Madhubala who files a case against him and gets him jailed but withdraws it after some time. Raja\u2019s aunt Baiji dies. Being in jail and unable to donate blood to save her life, he thinks Madhubala is responsible for it and begins hating and torturing her. It is revealed Raja's brother-in-law plotted this to take over the family property.\n\nMadhubala gets pregnant with Raja's child and later requests him to forgive her which Raja does; they remarry and begin living separately from his family. Raja opens a garage to start earning living. One night, a producer assumes him as RK and proposes to do a film with him that the producer had wanted to do with RK and Madhu. \n\nMadhubala reads Madhu\u2019s diary, learning that Madhu\u2019s last wish was to make a film on her and RK\u2019s life. Madhubala convinces Raja to sign the film; they start their career and appear as Madhu and RK, giving the first shot of their film.

Over the principal doorway there is a lifesize bronze statue of the Virgin and Child by [[Girolamo Lombardo]]; the three superb bronze doors executed at the latter end of the 16th century under the reign of [[Pope Paul V|Paul V]] (1605\u20131621) are also by Lombardo (1506-1590), his sons and his pupils, among them [[Tiburzio Vergelli]] (1551-1609), who also made the fine bronze [[baptismal font|font]] in the interior. The doors and hanging lamps are by the same artists.<ref name=fodors/>\n\nThe richly decorated [[campanile]] (1750 to 1754), by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]],<ref name=fodors/> is of great height; the principal bell, presented by [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] in 1516, weighs 11 tons.\n\nThe interior of the church has [[mosaic]]s by [[Domenichino]] and [[Guido Reni]] and other works of art, including statues by [[Raffaello da Montelupo]]. In the [[Sacristy|sacristies]] on each side of the right [[transept]] are [[fresco]]es, on the right by [[Melozzo da Forl\u00ec]], on the left by [[Luca Signorelli]] and in both there are some fine [[intarsia]]s; the basilica as a whole is thus a collaborative work by generations of architects and artists.\n\n==The ''Santa Casa''==\n[[File:Santuario della Santa Casa in Loreto - Casa Santa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Marble screen around the Holy House]]\n\nThe main attraction of Loreto is the Holy House itself (in [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''Santa Casa di Loreto''). It has been a [[Catholic]] pilgrimage destination since at least the 14th century and a popular tourist destination for non-Catholics as well.\n\n===Description===\n====The \"house\"====\nThe \"house\" itself is a plain stone building, 8.5&nbsp;m  by 3.8 m  and 4.1 m  high; it has a door on the north side and a window on the west. A niche contains a small [[black Madonna|black image of the Virgin and Child]], a statue in [[Lebanon cedar]], richly adorned with jewels (for more see [[Basilica della Santa Casa#Our Lady of Loreto|below]]).\n\n====The sculpted marble screen====\nAround the house is a tall marble screen designed by Bramante and executed under Popes Leo&nbsp;X, [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] and [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], by [[Andrea Sansovino]], Girolamo Lombardo, [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli|Bandinelli]], [[Guglielmo della Porta]] and others in the [[baroque]] style. The four sides represent the [[Annunciation]], the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]], the Arrival of the Santa Casa at Loreto and the [[Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary|Nativity of the Virgin]], respectively.\n\n===The treasury===\nThe treasury contains a large variety of rich and curious votive offerings. The architectural design is finer than the details of the sculpture. The apse is decorated with 19th-century German frescoes.\n\n==Tradition==\n[[File:Loreto Fresko.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fresco by [[Melozzo da Forl\u00ec]] in the sacristy of St Marc]]\n\nThe town has been a popular pilgrimage site{{for what|date=April 2020}} since the 13th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===In Nazareth===\nLate medieval religious traditions developed suggesting that this was the house in which the [[Holy Family]] (Mary, Joseph and Jesus) had lived while in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] at the start of the first century AD, and which was miraculously flown over to Europe by four angels just before the final expulsion of the Christian [[Crusaders]] from the [[Holy Land]], in order to protect it from [[Muslim]] soldiers. According to this narrative, the house at [[Nazareth]] in which [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] had been born and brought up, potentially received the [[Annunciation]], and had lived during the childhood of Christ{{dubious|Is it really part of the legend? A married woman moved to her husband's house.|date=April 2020}} and after his [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]], and was converted into a church by the [[Twelve Apostles]].{{dubious|Poor use of punctuation. Is it meant to say that she lived in the house after the Ascension, or that the Apostles made it into a church  after the Ascension? If the former, we do have different, strong post-Ascension traditions placing Mary in Jerusalem and Ephesus, NOT Nazareth.|date=April 2020}}{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 336, [[Helena (Empress)|Empress Helena]] made a pilgrimage to Nazareth and allegedly directed that a basilica be erected over it, in which worship continued until the fall of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. However, there is no firm historical evidence that Helena did in fact make such a intervention.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===To Dalmatia and Italy===\nThe tale further states that, threatened with destruction by Muslim soldiers, the house was miraculously carried by [[angel]]s through the air and initially deposited in 1291 on a hill at [[Tersatto]] (now Trsat, a suburb of [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]), where an appearance of the Virgin and numerous [[miracle|miraculous]] cures attested to its sanctity. The miraculous translation of the house is said to have been confirmed by investigations made at Nazareth by messengers from the governor of [[Dalmatia]]. In 1294, angels again carried it across the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the woods near [[Recanati]] (although the reasoning is not clear as to why this happened); from these woods (Latin ''lauretum'', Italian ''Colle dei Lauri'' or from the name of its proprietress Laureta) the chapel derived the name which it still retains (Lat. ''sacellum glorios\u00e6 Virginis in Laureto''). From this spot it was afterwards removed to the present hill in 1295, with a slight adjustment being required to fix it in its current site. It is this house that gave rise to the title ''Our Lady of Loreto'', sometimes applied to the Virgin; the miracle is occasionally represented in religious art wherein the house is borne by an angelic host.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Papal support===\n[[papal bull|Bulls]] in favour of the Shrine at Loreto were issued by [[Pope Sixtus IV|Pope Sixtus IV]] in 1491 (although, since Sixtus IV died in 1484, either the date is erroneous, or else the pope should be Innocent VIII), and by [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] in 1507, the last alluding to the translation of the house with some caution (''ut pie creditur et fama est''). While, like most miracles, the translation of the house is not a matter of faith for Catholics, nonetheless, in the late 17th century, [[Pope Innocent XII|Innocent XII]] appointed a ''missa cum officio proprio'' (a special [[mass]]) for the Feast of the Translation of the Holy House, which as late as the 20th century was enjoined in the [[Spanish Breviary]] as a [[Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite#History|greater double]] on December 10. This mass was recently restored by Pope Francis in 2019.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 4 October 2012, [[Benedict XVI]] visited the Shrine to mark the 50th anniversary of [[John XXIII]]'s visit. In his visit, Benedict formally entrusted the [[World Synod of Bishops]] and the Year of Faith to the Virgin of Loreto.<ref name=cns>{{cite news |title= Pope at Marian shrine entrusts Year of Faith, synod to Mary |url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1204169.htm |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121205203916/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1204169.htm |url-status= dead |archive-date=5 December 2012 |access-date=18 December 2012 |newspaper= Catholic News Service |date=4 October 2012 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2012/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20121004_loreto_en.html Pastoral visit of Benedict XVI to Loreto] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130102054537/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2012/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20121004_loreto_en.html |date=2 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/prayers/documents/hf_ben-xvi_20070901_prayer-loreto_en.html Benedict XVI, Prayer to Our Lady of Loreto] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130102120718/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/prayers/documents/hf_ben-xvi_20070901_prayer-loreto_en.html |date= January 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Historicity==\nThe documented history of the house can only be traced as far back as the close of the [[Crusades]], around the 14th century. An early brief reference is made in the ''Italia Illustrata'' of [[Flavius Blondus]] (1392\u20131463), secretary to Popes [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene&nbsp;IV]], [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], [[Pope Calixtus III|Calixtus III]] and [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]]; it can be read in its entirety in the ''Redemptoris mundi Matris Ecclesi\u00e6 Lauretana historia'', by a certain Teremannus, contained in the ''Opera Omnia'' (1576) of [[Mantuanus|Baptista Mantuanus]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to [[Herbert Thurston]], in some respects the Lauretan tradition is \"beset with difficulties of the gravest kind\", which were noted in a 1906 work on the subject. There are documents which indicate that a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin already existed at Loreto in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that is, 180 years before the time of the supposed translation; and there is no mention of the supposed miraculous translation of the Holy House in 1472. Thurston notes that papal confirmations of the Loreto tradition are relatively late (the first Bull mentioning the translation is that of Julius II in 1507), but that they are at first very guarded in expression, for Julius introduces the clause \"''ut pie creditur et fama est''\", \"as is piously believed and reported to be\".<ref name=Thurston>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13454b.htm Thurston, Herbert. \"Santa Casa di Loreto.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 December 2017</ref> Thurston suggests that a miracle-working statue or picture of the Madonna was brought from Tersato in [[Illyria]] to Loreto by some pious Christians and was then confounded with the ancient rustic chapel in which it was harboured, the veneration formerly given to the statue afterwards passing to the building.<ref name=Thurston/>\n\nFinally, he draws comparisons to the shrine at [[Our Lady of Walsingham|Walsingham]], the principal English shrine of the Blessed Virgin, the legend of \"Our Lady's house\" (written down about 1465, and consequently earlier than the Loreto translation tradition) supposes that in the time of St. Edward the Confessor a chapel was built at Walsingham, which exactly reproduced the dimensions of the Holy House of Nazareth. When the carpenters could not complete it upon the site that had been chosen, it was transferred and erected by angels' hands at a spot two hundred feet away.<ref>\"The Month\", September 1901</ref>\n\nIn modern times, the Church traced the linguistic origins of the story to a local aristocratic family called \"Angelos\", which were responsible for the transfer.<ref name=kerr>{{cite news|last=Kerr|first=David|title=Pope entrusts Year of Faith, evangelization synod to Mary|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-entrusts-year-of-faith-evangelization-synod-to-mary/|accessdate=18 December 2012|newspaper=Catholic News Agency|date=4 October 2012}}</ref> According to Papal archivist Giuseppe Lapponi, it seems that a family by the name of Angeli saved the bricks of the Holy House from the Muslim invasion. Excavations beneath the House of Loreto found coins, two of which are connected to the Angeli family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/o/our-lady-of-loreto-and-aviation.php |title=Roten SM, Johann. \"Our Lady of Loreto and Aviation\", International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton |publisher=Udayton.edu |date=1920-03-24 |accessdate=2020-01-19}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Our Lady of Loreto.jpg|thumb|The venerated Marian image of ''Our Lady of Loreto''.

Over the principal doorway there is a lifesize bronze statue of the Virgin and Child by [[Girolamo Lombardo]]; the three superb bronze doors executed at the latter end of the 16th century under the reign of [[Pope Paul V|Paul V]] (1605\u20131621) are also by Lombardo (1506-1590), his sons and his pupils, among them [[Tiburzio Vergelli]] (1551-1609), who also made the fine bronze [[baptismal font|font]] in the interior. The doors and hanging lamps are by the same artists.<ref name=fodors/>\n\nThe richly decorated [[campanile]] (1750 to 1754), by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]],<ref name=fodors/> is of great height; the principal bell, presented by [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] in 1516, weighs 11 tons.\n\nThe interior of the church has [[mosaic]]s by [[Domenichino]] and [[Guido Reni]] and other works of art, including statues by [[Raffaello da Montelupo]]. In the [[Sacristy|sacristies]] on each side of the right [[transept]] are [[fresco]]es, on the right by [[Melozzo da Forl\u00ec]], on the left by [[Luca Signorelli]] and in both there are some fine [[intarsia]]s; the basilica as a whole is thus a collaborative work by generations of architects and artists.\n\n==The ''Santa Casa''==\n[[File:Santuario della Santa Casa in Loreto - Casa Santa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Marble screen around the Holy House]]\n\nThe main attraction of Loreto is the Holy House itself (in [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''Santa Casa di Loreto''). It has been a [[Catholic]] pilgrimage destination since at least the 14th century and a popular tourist destination for non-Catholics as well.\n\n===Description===\n====The \"house\"====\nThe \"house\" itself is a plain stone building, 8.5&nbsp;m  by 3.8 m  and 4.1 m  high; it has a door on the north side and a window on the west. A niche contains a small [[black Madonna|black image of the Virgin and Child]], a statue in [[Lebanon cedar]], richly adorned with jewels (for more see [[Basilica della Santa Casa#Our Lady of Loreto|below]]).\n\n====The sculpted marble screen====\nAround the house is a tall marble screen designed by Bramante and executed under Popes Leo&nbsp;X, [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] and [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], by [[Andrea Sansovino]], Girolamo Lombardo, [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli|Bandinelli]], [[Guglielmo della Porta]] and others in the [[baroque]] style. The four sides represent the [[Annunciation]], the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]], the Arrival of the Santa Casa at Loreto and the [[Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary|Nativity of the Virgin]], respectively.\n\n===The treasury===\nThe treasury contains a large variety of rich and curious votive offerings. The architectural design is finer than the details of the sculpture. The apse is decorated with 19th-century German frescoes.\n\n==Tradition==\n[[File:Loreto Fresko.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fresco by [[Melozzo da Forl\u00ec]] in the sacristy of St Marc]]\n\nThe town has been a popular pilgrimage site{{for what|date=April 2020}} since the 13th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===In Nazareth===\nLate medieval religious traditions developed suggesting that this was the house in which the [[Holy Family]] (Mary, Joseph and Jesus) had lived while in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] at the start of the first century AD, and which was miraculously flown over to Europe by four angels just before the final expulsion of the Christian [[Crusaders]] from the [[Holy Land]], in order to protect it from [[Muslim]] soldiers. According to this narrative, the house at [[Nazareth]] in which [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] had been born and brought up, potentially received the [[Annunciation]], and had lived during the childhood of Christ{{dubious|Is it really part of the legend? A married woman moved to her husband's house.|date=April 2020}} and after his [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]], and was converted into a church by the [[Twelve Apostles]].{{dubious|Poor use of punctuation. Is it meant to say that she lived in the house after the Ascension, or that the Apostles made it into a church  after the Ascension? If the former, we do have different, strong post-Ascension traditions placing Mary in Jerusalem and Ephesus, NOT Nazareth.|date=April 2020}}{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 336, [[Helena (Empress)|Empress Helena]] made a pilgrimage to Nazareth and allegedly directed that a basilica be erected over it, in which worship continued until the fall of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. However, there is no firm historical evidence that Helena did in fact make such a intervention.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===To Dalmatia and Italy===\nThe tale further states that, threatened with destruction by Muslim soldiers, the house was miraculously carried by [[angel]]s through the air and initially deposited in 1291 on a hill at [[Tersatto]] (now Trsat, a suburb of [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]), where an appearance of the Virgin and numerous [[miracle|miraculous]] cures attested to its sanctity. The miraculous translation of the house is said to have been confirmed by investigations made at Nazareth by messengers from the governor of [[Dalmatia]]. In 1294, angels again carried it across the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the woods near [[Recanati]] (although the reasoning is not clear as to why this happened); from these woods (Latin ''lauretum'', Italian ''Colle dei Lauri'' or from the name of its proprietress Laureta) the chapel derived the name which it still retains (Lat. ''sacellum glorios\u00e6 Virginis in Laureto''). From this spot it was afterwards removed to the present hill in 1295, with a slight adjustment being required to fix it in its current site. It is this house that gave rise to the title ''Our Lady of Loreto'', sometimes applied to the Virgin; the miracle is occasionally represented in religious art wherein the house is borne by an angelic host.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Papal support===\n[[papal bull|Bulls]] in favour of the Shrine at Loreto were issued by [[Pope Sixtus IV|Pope Sixtus IV]] in 1491 (although, since Sixtus IV died in 1484, euther the date is erroneous, or else the pope should be Innocent VIII), and by [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] in 1507, the last alluding to the translation of the house with some caution (''ut pie creditur et fama est''). While, like most miracles, the translation of the house is not a matter of faith for Catholics, nonetheless, in the late 17th century, [[Pope Innocent XII|Innocent XII]] appointed a ''missa cum officio proprio'' (a special [[mass]]) for the Feast of the Translation of the Holy House, which as late as the 20th century was enjoined in the [[Spanish Breviary]] as a [[Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite#History|greater double]] on December 10. This mass was recently restored by Pope Francis in 2019.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 4 October 2012, [[Benedict XVI]] visited the Shrine to mark the 50th anniversary of [[John XXIII]]'s visit. In his visit, Benedict formally entrusted the [[World Synod of Bishops]] and the Year of Faith to the Virgin of Loreto.<ref name=cns>{{cite news |title= Pope at Marian shrine entrusts Year of Faith, synod to Mary |url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1204169.htm |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121205203916/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1204169.htm |url-status= dead |archive-date=5 December 2012 |access-date=18 December 2012 |newspaper= Catholic News Service |date=4 October 2012 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2012/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20121004_loreto_en.html Pastoral visit of Benedict XVI to Loreto] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130102054537/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2012/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20121004_loreto_en.html |date=2 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/prayers/documents/hf_ben-xvi_20070901_prayer-loreto_en.html Benedict XVI, Prayer to Our Lady of Loreto] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130102120718/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/prayers/documents/hf_ben-xvi_20070901_prayer-loreto_en.html |date= January 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Historicity==\nThe documented history of the house can only be traced as far back as the close of the [[Crusades]], around the 14th century. An early brief reference is made in the ''Italia Illustrata'' of [[Flavius Blondus]] (1392\u20131463), secretary to Popes [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene&nbsp;IV]], [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], [[Pope Calixtus III|Calixtus III]] and [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]]; it can be read in its entirety in the ''Redemptoris mundi Matris Ecclesi\u00e6 Lauretana historia'', by a certain Teremannus, contained in the ''Opera Omnia'' (1576) of [[Mantuanus|Baptista Mantuanus]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to [[Herbert Thurston]], in some respects the Lauretan tradition is \"beset with difficulties of the gravest kind\", which were noted in a 1906 work on the subject. There are documents which indicate that a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin already existed at Loreto in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that is, 180 years before the time of the supposed translation; and there is no mention of the supposed miraculous translation of the Holy House in 1472. Thurston notes that papal confirmations of the Loreto tradition are relatively late (the first Bull mentioning the translation is that of Julius II in 1507), but that they are at first very guarded in expression, for Julius introduces the clause \"''ut pie creditur et fama est''\", \"as is piously believed and reported to be\".<ref name=Thurston>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13454b.htm Thurston, Herbert. \"Santa Casa di Loreto.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 December 2017</ref> Thurston suggests that a miracle-working statue or picture of the Madonna was brought from Tersato in [[Illyria]] to Loreto by some pious Christians and was then confounded with the ancient rustic chapel in which it was harboured, the veneration formerly given to the statue afterwards passing to the building.<ref name=Thurston/>\n\nFinally, he draws comparisons to the shrine at [[Our Lady of Walsingham|Walsingham]], the principal English shrine of the Blessed Virgin, the legend of \"Our Lady's house\" (written down about 1465, and consequently earlier than the Loreto translation tradition) supposes that in the time of St. Edward the Confessor a chapel was built at Walsingham, which exactly reproduced the dimensions of the Holy House of Nazareth. When the carpenters could not complete it upon the site that had been chosen, it was transferred and erected by angels' hands at a spot two hundred feet away.<ref>\"The Month\", September 1901</ref>\n\nIn modern times, the Church traced the linguistic origins of the story to a local aristocratic family called \"Angelos\", which were responsible for the transfer.<ref name=kerr>{{cite news|last=Kerr|first=David|title=Pope entrusts Year of Faith, evangelization synod to Mary|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-entrusts-year-of-faith-evangelization-synod-to-mary/|accessdate=18 December 2012|newspaper=Catholic News Agency|date=4 October 2012}}</ref> According to Papal archivist Giuseppe Lapponi, it seems that a family by the name of Angeli saved the bricks of the Holy House from the Muslim invasion. Excavations beneath the House of Loreto found coins, two of which are connected to the Angeli family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/o/our-lady-of-loreto-and-aviation.php |title=Roten SM, Johann. \"Our Lady of Loreto and Aviation\", International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton |publisher=Udayton.edu |date=1920-03-24 |accessdate=2020-01-19}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Our Lady of Loreto.jpg|thumb|The venerated Marian image of ''Our Lady of Loreto''.

The show aired at 9pm on weekdays and had a repeat telecast at 8am the following day. It stars [[Shaun Chen]] , [[Chen Hanwei]] & [[Jesseca Liu]] as the casts of this series. This Drama entailed a lot of cameo appearances by famous Singaporean artists such as [[Zoe Tay]], [[Rebecca Lim]], [[Xiang Yun]], [[Jack Neo]], [[Carrie Wong]] and more.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThrough the lives of Zhou Fada ([[Shaun Chen]]), Ye Xiaoying ([[Chen Hanwei]]) and Zhang Weixiong ([[Jesseca Liu]]), three ordinary characters who grew up in Dakota Crescent, a series of interesting, exciting and personal stories will unfold\u2026\n\nZhou Fada, also known as Big Brother, is a man with a strong sense of justice, loyalty and compassion. He always like to help neighbor handle the promblem in need. But because of his overzealous and reckless character, his good intentions often turn out to cause more trouble than help.\n\nYe Xiaoying is Fada's uncle, who always dreams of achieving phenomenal success in life, but he never did live up to his dreams as he is essentially just a slacker. He is very good at keeping out of trouble, by tactically avoiding tricky situations. His motto in life is: A man's greatest power is not his fists, but his tongue. He believes that being good with words can help one sail through career and relationships smoothly, but the fact is, his career and love affairs are almost always on the rocks.\n\nZhang Weixiong is a manly name, but the owner of the name is actually a cute girl. When her mother was pregnant with her, the ultrasound scan showed that it was a baby boy, so her father went to the fortune teller and got her this dashing manly name. Who would have expected that it was a baby girl! But they went along with the name \u201cWei Xiong\u201d after all. Weixiong is just like her name; she has great ambitions and a gusty character, and people in the neighborhood see her as the future elite. Unfortunately, that is just her pretense. She is actually very timid and cowardly, but she believes that in order to survive in this dog-eat-dog world, you will have to \u201cnever say die\u201d. So even though she is crumbling from fear inside, she would always put up a strong front, and her strong-headedness always gets her into trouble. If not for the help of Big Brother Fada, with this personality, she might have much consequences to suffer.\n\nThis three characters, together known as \u201cThe Great Hero\u201d, are the three musketeers of the neighborhood, and from them, we will get to know many other members of [[Dakota Crescent]], and also their inspiring, interesting and heart-warming stories.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Zhou

The show aired at 9pm on weekdays and had a repeat telecast at 8am the following day. It stars [[Shaun Chen]] , [[Chen Hanwei]] & [[Jesseca Liu]] as the casts of this series. This Drama entailed a lot of cameo appearances by famous Singaporean artists such as [[Zoe Tay]], [[Rebecca Lim]], [[Xiang Yun]], [[Jack Neo]], [[Carrie Wong]] and more.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThrough the lives of Zhou Fada ([[Shaun Chen]]), Ye Xiaoying ([[Chen Hanwei]]) and Zhang Weixiong ([[Jesseca Liu]]), three ordinary characters who grew up in Dakota Crescent, a series of interesting, exciting and personal stories will unfold\u2026\n\nZhou Fada, also known as Big Brother, is a man with a strong sense of justice, loyalty and compassion. He always like to help neighbor handle the promblem in need. But because of his overzealous and reckless character, his good intentions often turn out to cause more trouble than help.\n\nYe Xiaoying is Fada's uncle, who always dreams of achieving phenomenal success in life, but he never did live up to his dreams as he is essentially just a slacker. He is very good at keeping out of trouble, by tactically avoiding tricky situations. His motto in life is: A man's greatest power is not his fists, but his tongue. He believes that being good with words can help one sail through career and relationships smoothly, but the fact is, his career and love affairs are almost always on the rocks.\n\nZhang Weixiong is a manly name, but the owner of the name is actually a cute girl. When her mother was pregnant with her, the ultrasound scan showed that it was a baby boy, so her father went to the fortune teller and got her this dashing manly name. Who would have expected that it was a baby girl! But they went along with the name \u201cWei Xiong\u201d after all. Weixiong is just like her name; she has great ambitions and a gusty character, and people in the neighborhood see her as the future elite. Unfortunately, that is just her pretense. She is actually very timid and cowardly, but she believes that in order to survive in this dog-eat-dog world, you will have to \u201cnever say die\u201d. So even though she is crumbling from fear inside, she would always put up a strong front, and her strong-headedness always gets her into trouble. If not for the help of Big Brother Fada, with this personality, she might have much consequences to suffer.\n\nThis three characters, together known as \u201cThe Great Hero\u201d, are the three musketeers of the neighborhood, and from them, we will get to know many other members of [[Dakota Crescent]], and also their inspiring, interesting and heart-warming stories.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Zhou

The district is located in the eastern part of the city, directly east of downtown Wiesbaden, and has about 12,300 inhabitants.  Formerly an independent municipality, the town was incorporated into Wiesbaden on April 1, 1928. While ''Bierstadt'' can be translated ''Beer Town'', the name is actually derived from [[Saint Brigid of Kildare]], Ireland (''Birgid'' in German).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Nikolauskirche WB.jpg|thumb|left|Church of St. Nicholas, Bierstadt|200px]]\nThe earliest traces of settlement in the Bierstadt area date to the [[Stone Age]]. However, Bierstadt was first mentioned in historical records, as \"Birgidestad\", in a deed of gift on March 12, 927. The town was founded by Irish monks, who named it after the Irish national saint, St. Brigid. In the 11th\u201312th centuries, the (now Protestant) Church of St. Nicholas was built. The church is not only the oldest existing church in Wiesbaden, but, after the Roman-era Heathens' Wall in downtown Wiesbaden, is the second oldest building of any kind in the city.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], Bierstadt came under the dominion of [[Nassau (state)|Nassau]], but was subject to strong influences from the [[Archdiocese of Mainz]]. In the wake of the Reformation, Bierstadt came fully under the control of Nassau.\n\nAfter the [[Thirty Years' War]], the town had only 17 inhabitants. Efforts at reconstruction were set back through a fire in 1691. By the middle of the 18th century, Bierstadt had about 500 residents.\n\nThe remains of a medieval watchtower, the  ''Bierstadter Warte'', are located on a height between Wiesbaden and the district. The Warte is now part of the coat of arms.\nIn 1898, a large observation tower, the [[Wiesbaden Bismarck Tower]], was planned to be built at this site. A temporary wooden tower was constructed in 1910, but funding for the permanent structure could not be obtained. The temporary tower was demolished in 1918.\n\nDuring the [[Third Reich]], Nazism dominated in Bierstadt. On November 9, 1938, the Bierstadt synagogue, dating to 1827, was destroyed.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], about 1800 homes were built in Bierstadt for occupation forces of the [[United States Army]]. The Aukamm and Crestview developments are located on the northwest and west side of Bierstadt, respectively.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nBierstadt has a library and two schools, including one primary school - Grundschule Bierstadt, and  a gymnasium named Theodor-Fliedner-Schule which was formerly a middle school.

The district is located in the eastern part of the city, directly east of downtown Wiesbaden, and has about 12,300 inhabitants.  Formerly an independent municipality, the town was incorporated into Wiesbaden on April 1, 1928. While ''Bierstadt'' can be translated ''Beer Town'', the name is actually derived from [[Saint Brigid of Kildare]], Ireland (''Birgid'' in German).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Nikolauskirche WB.jpg|thumb|left|Church of St. Nicholas, Bierstadt|200px]]\nThe earliest traces of settlement in the Bierstadt area date to the [[Stone Age]]. However, Bierstadt was first mentioned in historical records, as \"Birgidestad\", in a deed of gift on March 12, 927. The town was founded by Irish monks, who named it after the Irish national saint, St. Brigid. In the 11th\u201312th centuries, the (now Protestant) Church of St. Nicholas was built. The church is not only the oldest existing church in Wiesbaden, but, after the Roman-era Heathens' Wall in downtown Wiesbaden, is the second oldest building of any kind in the city.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], Bierstadt came under the dominion of [[Nassau (state)|Nassau]], but was subject to strong influences from the [[Archdiocese of Mainz]]. In the wake of the Reformation, Bierstadt came fully under the control of Nassau.\n\nAfter the [[Thirty Years' War]], the town had only 17 inhabitants. Efforts at reconstruction were set back through a fire in 1691. By the middle of the 18th century, Bierstadt had about 500 residents.\n\nThe remains of a medieval watchtower, the  ''Bierstadter Warte'', are located on a height between Wiesbaden and the district. The Warte is now part of the coat of arms.\nIn 1898, a large observation tower, the [[Wiesbaden Bismarck Tower]], was planned to be built at this site. A temporary wooden tower was constructed in 1910, but funding for the permanent structure could not be obtained. The temporary tower was demolished in 1918.\n\nDuring the [[Third Reich]], Nazism dominated in Bierstadt. On November 9, 1938, the Bierstadt synagogue, dating to 1827, was destroyed.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], about 1800 homes were built in Bierstadt for occupation forces of the [[United States Army]]. The Aukamm and Crestview developments are located on the northwest and west side of Bierstadt, respectively.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nBierstadt has a library and two schools, including one primary school - Grundschule Bierstadt, and  a gymnasium named Theodor-Fliedner-Schule which was formerly a middle school. Bierstadt is next to the ''Aukammtal'' and has access to the German Federal Route 455.\n\nBierstadt has two churches. In addition to the Protestant church (formerly the church of St. Nicholas), there is the [[Roman Catholic]] church of St. Birgid.\n\n==Twinning==\nSince 1991, Bierstadt has had a partnership with the [[France|French]] commune of [[Terrasson-Lavilledieu]]. The town of Terrasson is located on the banks of the [[V\u00e9z\u00e8re]] in southwestern France, about 150&nbsp;km east of [[Bordeaux]] in the heart of [[Aquitaine]], with which Hesse maintains a regional partnership.\n\n== Sources ==\n* adapted from [[:de:Wiesbaden-Bierstadt|German Wikipedia]]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://centennial.legion.org/france/postgr07 Post GR07] at American Legion Centennial Celebration (centennial.legion.org)\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20041226015846/http://www.wiesbaden.de/leben_wi/stadtteile/bierstadt.php (in German)\n*http://www.marlionetta.de\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20030801182401/http://www.fc34bierstadt.de/\n*http://www.kornmayer.com\n\n{{Wiesbaden}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Boroughs of Wiesbaden]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bierstadt"}
