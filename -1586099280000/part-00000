He made significant contributions to the [[real analysis|theory of functions of a real variable]], the [[calculus of variations]], and [[measure theory]]. His work also includes important results in [[conformal mapping|conformal representations]] and in the theory of boundary correspondence. In 1909, Carath\u00e9odory pioneered the ''Axiomatic Formulation of Thermodynamics'' along a purely geometrical approach.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Caratheodory Constantin and Stephanos.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Constantin Caratheodory with his father, [[Alexander Karatheodori Pasha]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Governor]] of [[Crete]] and [[Ambassador]] of [[Berlin]].]]\n\nConstantin Carath\u00e9odory was born in [[Berlin]] to [[Greeks|Greek]] parents and grew up in [[Brussels]]. His father Stephanos, a lawyer, served as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ambassador to [[Belgium]], [[St. Petersburg]] and Berlin. His mother, Despina, n\u00e9e Petrokokkinos, was from the island of [[Chios]]. The Carath\u00e9odory family, originally from [[Bosnochori]] or [[Vyssa]], was well established and respected in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], and its members held many important governmental positions.\n\nThe Carath\u00e9odory family spent 1874\u201375 in Constantinople, where Constantin's paternal grandfather lived, while his father Stephanos was on leave. Then in 1875 they went to Brussels when Stephanos was appointed there as Ottoman Ambassador. In Brussels, Constantin's younger sister Julia was born. The year 1879 was a tragic one for the family since Constantin's paternal grandfather died in that year, but much more tragically, Constantin's mother Despina died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Cannes]]. Constantin's maternal grandmother took on the task of bringing up Constantin and Julia in his father's home in Belgium. They employed a German maid who taught the children to speak German. Constantin was already bilingual in French and Greek by this time.\n\nConstantin began his formal schooling at a private school in Vanderstock in 1881. He left after two years and then spent time with his father on a visit to Berlin, and also spent the winters of 1883\u201384 and 1884\u201385 on the [[Italian Riviera]]. Back in Brussels in 1885 he attended a grammar school for a year where he first began to become interested in mathematics. In 1886, he entered the high school Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Royal d'Ixelles and studied there until his graduation in 1891. Twice during his time at this school Constantin won a prize as the best mathematics student in Belgium.\n\n[[Image:Caratheodory family.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Constantin Caratheodory (left) pictured sitting with his father, brother in law and sister, Carlsbad 1898]]\n\nAt this stage Carath\u00e9odory began training as a military engineer. He attended the \u00c9cole Militaire de Belgique from October 1891 to May 1895 and he also studied at the \u00c9cole d'Application from 1893 to 1896. In 1897 [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a war broke out]] between the Ottoman Empire and Greece. This put Carath\u00e9odory in a difficult position since he sided with the Greeks, yet his father served the government of the Ottoman Empire. Since he was a trained engineer he was offered a job in the British colonial service. This job took him to Egypt where he worked on the construction of the [[Assiut]] dam until April 1900. During periods when construction work had to stop due to floods, he studied mathematics from some textbooks he had with him, such as [[Camille Jordan|Jordan's]] ''Cours d'Analyse'' and Salmon's text on the analytic geometry of [[conic sections]].

Continued working from Bavarian Academy of Science\n\n===Doctoral students===\nCarath\u00e9odory had about 20 doctoral students among these being [[Hans Rademacher]], known for his work on analysis and number theory, and [[Paul Finsler]] known for his creation of [[Finsler space]].\n\n===Academic contacts in Germany===\nCarath\u00e9odory's contacts in Germany were many and included such famous names as: [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein|Klein]], [[Einstein]], [[Hermann Amandus Schwarz|Schwarz]], [[Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r|Fej\u00e9r]]. During the difficult period of World War II his close associates at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences were Perron and Tietze.\n\n===Academic contacts in Greece===\nWhile in Germany Carath\u00e9odory retained numerous links with the Greek academic world about which detailed information may be found in Georgiadou's book. He was directly involved with the reorganization of Greek universities. An especially close friend and colleague in Athens was Nicolaos Kritikos who had attended his lectures at G\u014fttingen, later going with him to Smyrna, then becoming professor at Athens Polytechnic. Kritikos and Carath\u00e9odory helped the Greek topologist [[Christos Papakyriakopoulos]] take a doctorate in topology at Athens University in 1943 under very difficult circumstances. While teaching in Athens University Carath\u00e9odory had as undergraduate student Evangelos Stamatis who subsequently achieved considerable distinction as a scholar of ancient Greek mathematical classics.<ref>J P Christianidis & N Kastanis: ''In memoriam Evangelos S Stamatis (1898\u20131990) Historia Mathematica 19 (1992) 99-105''</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Caratheodorys theorem example.png|thumb|200px|An illustration of [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (convex hull)]] for a square in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>.]]\n[[Image:Caratheodory and Fej\u00e9r.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Constantin Caratheodory (left) with Hungarian mathematician [[Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r]] (1880\u20131959) (standing to the right).]]\n\n===Calculus of variations===\nIn his doctoral dissertation Carath\u00e9odory originated his method based on the use of the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] to construct a field of extremals. The ideas are closely related to light propagation in optics. The method became known as ''the royal road to the calculus of variations''.<ref>H. Boerner, ''Carath\u00e9odory und die Variationsrechnung'', in A Panayotopolos (ed.), Proceedings of C. Carath\u00e9odory International Symposium, September 1973, Athens (Athens, 1974), 80\u201390.</ref> More recently the same idea has been taken into the theory of [[optimal control]].<ref>[[Richard Bellman|Bellman]] for his ''Dynamic programming'' in its continuous-time form used Carath\u00e9odory's work in the form of the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation]]. [[Rudolf E. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n|K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]] also explicitly used Carath\u00e9odory's formulation in his initial papers on optimal control. See e.g. R. E. Kalman: ''Contributions to the theory of optimal control''. Boletin de la Sociedad Matematica Mexicana 1960</ref> The method can also be extended to multiple integrals.\n\n===Real analysis===\nHe proved an [[Carath\u00e9odory's existence theorem|existence theorem]] for the  solution to ordinary differential equations under mild regularity conditions.\n\n===Theory of measure===\nHe is credited with the [[Carath\u00e9odory extension theorem]] which is fundamental to modern measure theory. Later Carath\u00e9odory extended the theory from sets to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.\n\n===Theory of functions of a complex variable===\nHe greatly extended the theory of [[conformal transformation]]<ref>A. Shields: ''Carath\u00e9odory and Conformal Mapping'' Math. Intelligencer vol.10(1), 1988</ref> proving his [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (conformal mapping)|theorem]] about the extension of conformal mapping to the boundary of Jordan domains.  In studying boundary correspondence he originated the theory of [[prime end]]s.\n\n===Thermodynamics===\nIn 1909, Carath\u00e9odory published a pioneering work \"Investigations on the Foundations of Thermodynamics\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carath\u00e9odory|first=Constantin|title=Untersuchungen ueber die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik|trans-title=Examination of the foundations of Thermodynamics| journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=67|issue=3|year=1909|pages=355\u2013386|doi=10.1007/bf01450409|translator-last=Delphinich|translator-first=D. H.|url=http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/caratheodory_-_thermodynamics.pdf}}</ref> in which he formulated the [[Laws of Thermodynamics]] axiomatically. It has been said{{according to whom|date=January 2014}} that he was using only mechanical concepts and the theory of [[Johann Friedrich Pfaff|Pfaff']]<nowiki/>s differential forms. But in reality he also relied heavily on the concept of an [[adiabatic process]]. The physical meaning of the term adiabatic rests on the concepts of [[heat]] and [[temperature]]. Thus, in Bailyn's survey of thermodynamics, Carath\u00e9odory's approach is called \"mechanical\", as distinct from \"thermodynamic\".<ref>Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, Woodbury NY, {{isbn|0-88318-797-3}}.</ref> Carath\u00e9odory's \"first axiomatically rigid foundation of thermodynamics\" was acclaimed by [[Max Born]]<ref>Max Born: ''The Born\u2013Einstein Letters'', MacMillan 1971</ref> but criticized by [[Max Planck]].<ref>[http://web.ist.utl.pt/ist12219/data/68.pdf Constantin Carath\u00e9odory and the axiomatic thermodynamics]'' by Lionello Pogliani and Mario N. Berberan-Santos</ref>\n\nIn his theory he simplified the basic concepts, for instance ''heat'' is not an essential concept but a derived one. He formulated the axiomatic principle of irreversibility in thermodynamics stating that inaccessibility of states is related to the existence of entropy, where temperature is the integration function. The [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] was expressed via the following axiom: \"In the neighbourhood of any initial state, there are states which cannot be approached arbitrarily close through adiabatic changes of state.\" In this connexion he coined the term [[adiabatic accessibility]].<ref>adiabatic accessibility = [[:de:Adiabatische Erreichbarkeit|adiabatische Erreichbarkeit]]; see also Elliott H. Lieb, Jakob Yngvason: [http://de.arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9708200 ''The Physics and Mathematics of the Second Law of Thermodynamics''], Phys. Rep. 310, 1\u201396 (1999) and Elliott H.

Lieb'', 2005, {{isbn|978-3-540-22297-2}}</ref>\n\n===Optics===\nCarath\u00e9odory's work in [[optics]] is closely related to his method in the calculus of variations.  In 1926<ref>''\u00dcber den Zusammenhang der Theorie der absoluten optischen Instrumente mit einem Satz der Variationsrechnung'', M\u00fcnchener Sitzb. Math. -naturw Abteilung 1926 1\u201318; Ges.

II 181\u2013197.</ref> he gave a strict and general proof that no system of lenses and mirrors can avoid [[Aberration in optical systems|aberration]], except for the trivial case of plane mirrors.\nIn his later work he gave the theory of the [[Schmidt telescope]].\n\n===Historical===\nDuring the 2nd World War Carath\u00e9odory edited two volumes of [[Euler]]'s Complete Works dealing with the Calculus of Variations which were submitted for publication in 1946.<ref>Euler Opera Omnia, Series 1 (a) vol.24: ''Methodus inveniendi lineas curvas maximi minimive gaudentes sive solutio problematis isoperimetrici latissimo sensu accepti''.

In 1920 Carath\u00e9odory was appointed Dean of the University and took a major part in establishing the institution, touring Europe to buy books and equipment. The university however never actually admitted students due to the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|War in Asia Minor]] which ended in the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]].

He later worked from the Bavarian Academy of Sciences until his death in 1950.\n\nThe new Greek University in the broader area of the Southeast Mediterranean region, as originally envisioned by Carath\u00e9odory, finally materialised with the establishment of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in 1925.<ref name=\"Brief History of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki\">{{cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/history|title=Brief History|publisher=Aristotle University of Thessaloniki|accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistic talent ==\nCarath\u00e9odory excelled at languages, much like many members of his family did. [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[French language|French]] were his first languages, and he mastered [[German language|German]] with such perfection, that his writings composed in the German language are stylistic masterworks.<ref>Denker, Forscher und Entdecker: eine Geschichte der Bayerischen Akademie\n By Dietmar Willoweit p.263</ref> Carath\u00e9odory also spoke and wrote [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and the [[ancient languages]] without any effort. Such an impressive linguistic arsenal enabled him to communicate and exchange ideas directly with other mathematicians during his numerous travels, and greatly extend his fields of knowledge.\n\nMuch more than that, Carath\u00e9odory was a treasured conversation partner for his fellow professors in the Munich Department of Philosophy. The well-respected, German [[philology|philologist]], professor of ancient languages Kurt von Fritz praised Carath\u00e9odory, saying that from him one could learn an endless amount about the old and new Greece, the old Greek language, and Hellenic mathematics. Fritz had numerous philosophical discussions with Carath\u00e9odory.\n\nThe Greek language was spoken exclusively in Carath\u00e9odory's house \u2013 his son Stephanos and daughter Despina went to a German high school, but they obtained daily additional instruction in Greek language and culture from a Greek priest.

He made significant contributions to the [[real analysis|theory of functions of a real variable]], the [[calculus of variations]], and [[measure theory]]. His work also includes important results in [[conformal mapping|conformal representations]] and in the theory of boundary correspondence. In 1909, Carath\u00e9odory pioneered the ''Axiomatic Formulation of Thermodynamics'' along a purely geometrical approach.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Caratheodory Constantin and Stephanos.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Constantin Caratheodory with his father, [[Alexander Karatheodori Pasha]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Governor]] of [[Crete]] and [[Ambassador]] of [[Berlin]].]]\n\nConstantin Carath\u00e9odory was born in [[Berlin]] to [[Greeks|Greek]] parents and grew up in [[Brussels]]. His father Stephanos, a lawyer, served as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ambassador to [[Belgium]], [[St. Petersburg]] and Berlin. His mother, Despina, n\u00e9e Petrokokkinos, was from the island of [[Chios]]. The Carath\u00e9odory family, originally from [[Bosnochori]] or [[Vyssa]], was well established and respected in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], and its members held many important governmental positions.\n\nThe Carath\u00e9odory family spent 1874\u201375 in Constantinople, where Constantin's paternal grandfather lived, while his father Stephanos was on leave. Then in 1875 they went to Brussels when Stephanos was appointed there as Ottoman Ambassador. In Brussels, Constantin's younger sister Julia was born. The year 1879 was a tragic one for the family since Constantin's paternal grandfather died in that year, but much more tragically, Constantin's mother Despina died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Cannes]]. Constantin's maternal grandmother took on the task of bringing up Constantin and Julia in his father's home in Belgium. They employed a German maid who taught the children to speak German. Constantin was already bilingual in French and Greek by this time.\n\nConstantin began his formal schooling at a private school in Vanderstock in 1881. He left after two years and then spent time with his father on a visit to Berlin, and also spent the winters of 1883\u201384 and 1884\u201385 on the [[Italian Riviera]]. Back in Brussels in 1885 he attended a grammar school for a year where he first began to become interested in mathematics. In 1886, he entered the high school Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Royal d'Ixelles and studied there until his graduation in 1891. Twice during his time at this school Constantin won a prize as the best mathematics student in Belgium.\n\n[[Image:Caratheodory family.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Constantin Caratheodory (left) pictured sitting with his father, brother in law and sister, Carlsbad 1898]]\n\nAt this stage Carath\u00e9odory began training as a military engineer. He attended the \u00c9cole Militaire de Belgique from October 1891 to May 1895 and he also studied at the \u00c9cole d'Application from 1893 to 1896. In 1897 [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a war broke out]] between the Ottoman Empire and Greece. This put Carath\u00e9odory in a difficult position since he sided with the Greeks, yet his father served the government of the Ottoman Empire. Since he was a trained engineer he was offered a job in the British colonial service. This job took him to Egypt where he worked on the construction of the [[Assiut]] dam until April 1900. During periods when construction work had to stop due to floods, he studied mathematics from some textbooks he had with him, such as [[Camille Jordan|Jordan's]] ''Cours d'Analyse'' and Salmon's text on the analytic geometry of [[conic sections]]. He also visited the [[Pyramid of Cheops|Cheops pyramid]] and made measurements which he wrote up and published in 1901.<ref>Brussells 1901 (Hayez);Ges. math. Schr. V. 273-281</ref> He also published a book on Egypt in the same year which contained a wealth of information on the history and geography of the country. <ref>H Aigyptos, Syllogos Ophelimon Biblion, no 14, 118 pp Athens 1901, 1928, New York 1920</ref>\n\n== Studies and university career ==\nCarath\u00e9odory studied engineering in [[Belgium]] at the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]], where he was considered a charismatic and brilliant student.\n\n===University career===\n\n* 1900  Studies at [[University of Berlin]].\n* 1902  Completed graduation at [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] (1904 Ph.D, 1905 Habilitation)\n* 1908  Dozent at [[University of Bonn|Bonn]]\n* 1909  Ordinary Professor at [[University of Hannover|Hannover Technical High School]].\n* 1910  Ordinary Professor at [[Wroc\u0142aw University of Technology|Breslau Technical High School]].\n* 1913  Professor following Klein at [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]].\n* 1919  Professor at [[University of Berlin]]\n* 1919  Elected to [[Prussian Academy of Science]].\n* 1920  University Dean at [[Ionian University of Smyrna]] (later, [[University of the Aegean]]).\n* 1922  Professor at [[University of Athens]].\n* 1922  Professor at [[Athens Polytechnic]].\n* 1924  Professor following Lindemann at [[University of Munich]].\n* 1938  Retirement from Professorship. Continued working from Bavarian Academy of Science\n\n===Doctoral students===\nCarath\u00e9odory had about 20 doctoral students among these being [[Hans Rademacher]], known for his work on analysis and number theory, and [[Paul Finsler]] known for his creation of [[Finsler space]].\n\n===Academic contacts in Germany===\nCarath\u00e9odory's contacts in Germany were many and included such famous names as: [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein|Klein]], [[Einstein]], [[Hermann Amandus Schwarz|Schwarz]], [[Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r|Fej\u00e9r]]. During the difficult period of World War II his close associates at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences were Perron and Tietze.\n\n===Academic contacts in Greece===\nWhile in Germany Carath\u00e9odory retained numerous links with the Greek academic world about which detailed information may be found in Georgiadou's book. He was directly involved with the reorganization of Greek universities. An especially close friend and colleague in Athens was Nicolaos Kritikos who had attended his lectures at G\u014fttingen, later going with him to Smyrna, then becoming professor at Athens Polytechnic. Kritikos and Carath\u00e9odory helped the Greek topologist [[Christos Papakyriakopoulos]] take a doctorate in topology at Athens University in 1943 under very difficult circumstances. While teaching in Athens University Carath\u00e9odory had as undergraduate student Evangelos Stamatis who subsequently achieved considerable distinction as a scholar of ancient Greek mathematical classics.<ref>J P Christianidis & N Kastanis: ''In memoriam Evangelos S Stamatis (1898\u20131990) Historia Mathematica 19 (1992) 99-105''</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Caratheodorys theorem example.png|thumb|200px|An illustration of [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (convex hull)]] for a square in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>.]]\n[[Image:Caratheodory and Fej\u00e9r.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Constantin Caratheodory (left) with Hungarian mathematician [[Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r]] (1880\u20131959) (standing to the right).]]\n\n===Calculus of variations===\nIn his doctoral dissertation Carath\u00e9odory originated his method based on the use of the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] to construct a field of extremals. The ideas are closely related to light propagation in optics. The method became known as ''the royal road to the calculus of variations''.<ref>H. Boerner, ''Carath\u00e9odory und die Variationsrechnung'', in A Panayotopolos (ed.), Proceedings of C. Carath\u00e9odory International Symposium, September 1973, Athens (Athens, 1974), 80\u201390.</ref> More recently the same idea has been taken into the theory of [[optimal control]].<ref>[[Richard Bellman|Bellman]] for his ''Dynamic programming'' in its continuous-time form used Carath\u00e9odory's work in the form of the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation]]. [[Rudolf E. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n|K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]] also explicitly used Carath\u00e9odory's formulation in his initial papers on optimal control. See e.g. R. E. Kalman: ''Contributions to the theory of optimal control''. Boletin de la Sociedad Matematica Mexicana 1960</ref> The method can also be extended to multiple integrals.\n\n===Real analysis===\nHe proved an [[Carath\u00e9odory's existence theorem|existence theorem]] for the  solution to ordinary differential equations under mild regularity conditions.\n\n===Theory of measure===\nHe is credited with the [[Carath\u00e9odory extension theorem]] which is fundamental to modern measure theory. Later Carath\u00e9odory extended the theory from sets to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.\n\n===Theory of functions of a complex variable===\nHe greatly extended the theory of [[conformal transformation]]<ref>A. Shields: ''Carath\u00e9odory and Conformal Mapping'' Math. Intelligencer vol.10(1), 1988</ref> proving his [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (conformal mapping)|theorem]] about the extension of conformal mapping to the boundary of Jordan domains.  In studying boundary correspondence he originated the theory of [[prime end]]s.\n\n===Thermodynamics===\nIn 1909, Carath\u00e9odory published a pioneering work \"Investigations on the Foundations of Thermodynamics\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carath\u00e9odory|first=Constantin|title=Untersuchungen ueber die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik|trans-title=Examination of the foundations of Thermodynamics| journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=67|issue=3|year=1909|pages=355\u2013386|doi=10.1007/bf01450409|translator-last=Delphinich|translator-first=D.

It has been said{{according to whom|date=January 2014}} that he was using only mechanical concepts and the theory of [[Johann Friedrich Pfaff|Pfaff']]<nowiki/>s differential forms. But in reality he also relied heavily on the concept of an [[adiabatic process]]. The physical meaning of the term adiabatic rests on the concepts of [[heat]] and [[temperature]]. Thus, in Bailyn's survey of thermodynamics, Carath\u00e9odory's approach is called \"mechanical\", as distinct from \"thermodynamic\".<ref>Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, Woodbury NY, {{isbn|0-88318-797-3}}.</ref> Carath\u00e9odory's \"first axiomatically rigid foundation of thermodynamics\" was acclaimed by [[Max Born]]<ref>Max Born: ''The Born\u2013Einstein Letters'', MacMillan 1971</ref> but criticized by [[Max Planck]].<ref>[http://web.ist.utl.pt/ist12219/data/68.pdf Constantin Carath\u00e9odory and the axiomatic thermodynamics]'' by Lionello Pogliani and Mario N. Berberan-Santos</ref>\n\nIn his theory he simplified the basic concepts, for instance ''heat'' is not an essential concept but a derived one. He formulated the axiomatic principle of irreversibility in thermodynamics stating that inaccessibility of states is related to the existence of entropy, where temperature is the integration function. The [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] was expressed via the following axiom: \"In the neighbourhood of any initial state, there are states which cannot be approached arbitrarily close through adiabatic changes of state.\" In this connexion he coined the term [[adiabatic accessibility]].<ref>adiabatic accessibility = [[:de:Adiabatische Erreichbarkeit|adiabatische Erreichbarkeit]]; see also Elliott H. Lieb, Jakob Yngvason: [http://de.arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9708200 ''The Physics and Mathematics of the Second Law of Thermodynamics''], Phys. Rep. 310, 1\u201396 (1999) and Elliott H.

He later worked from the Bavarian Academy of Sciences until his death in 1950.\n\nThe new Greek University in the broader area of the Southeast Mediterranean region, as originally envisioned by Carath\u00e9odory, finally materialised with the establishment of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in 1925.<ref name=\"Brief History of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki\">{{cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/history|title=Brief History|publisher=Aristotle University of Thessaloniki|accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistic talent ==\nCarath\u00e9odory excelled at languages, much like many members of his family did.

The well-respected, German [[philology|philologist]], professor of ancient languages Kurt von Fritz praised Carath\u00e9odory, saying that from him one could learn an endless amount about the old and new Greece, the old Greek language, and Hellenic mathematics.
