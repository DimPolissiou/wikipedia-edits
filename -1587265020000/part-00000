It held a [[royal charter]] for Bermuda until 1684, when it was dissolved, and [[the Crown]] assumed responsibility for the administration of Bermuda as a [[crown colony|royal colony]].\n\n==Bermuda under the Virginia Company==\n{{see also|Jamestown supply missions}}\n[[Image:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|\"[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]\", by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]]]]\nBermuda had been settled, inadvertently, in 1609 by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] when its flagship, ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was wrecked on the reefs to its east.<ref>A Discovery of The Barmudas, Sylvester Jordain</ref> The Admiral of the Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]], was at the helm as the ship fought a storm that had broken apart [[Third Supply|a relief fleet]] destined for [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the Virginian settlement established by the Company two years earlier.

During the building, ''Sea Venture'''s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When [[Sea Venture|''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'']] set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for [[Kingdom of England|England]], some dead. Those aboard the two ships included [[Sir Thomas Gates]], the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, [[William Strachey]], whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', and [[John Rolfe]], who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610. Matthew Somers was keen to receive his inheritance (Sir George and his wife were childless, but had raised his two nephews), and took ''Patience'' to Somers' hometown, [[Lyme Regis]], and not to Virginia.\n\nWhen news reached England of the adventures of ''Sea Venture'''s survivors, the royal charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include Bermuda on the 12th of March, 1612, at Westminster, with the archipelago granted by the Crown unto the ''Treasurer and Company of Aduenturers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first colony in Virginia''. The new colony was officially named ''Virgineola'', although this was soon changed to ''The Somers Isles'' or ''The Somers Islands'' in honour of Sir George Somers.\n\nA [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]], Richard Moore, arrived in 1612 with settlers, aboard ''Plough'', to join those left behind by ''Sea Venture'' and ''Patience''. The new settlers were primarily tenant farmers, who gave seven years of indentured servitude to the Company in exchange for the cost of transport. Although the primary industry was envisioned to be agriculture, the early Governors enthusiastically, if mostly unsuccessfully, attempted to develop other industries also. These included pearl diving (there are no pearls in Bermuda) and [[ambergris]]. The first two slaves to arrive in Bermuda, one black, one Native American, were brought in for their skills as pearl divers.\n\nFree of the endemic warfare and other hardships which plagued the continental settlement, Bermuda thrived from the beginning, though it was never to be particularly profitable for its investors. Its population quickly surpassed that of Jamestown, and consideration was given to abandoning the North American continent and evacuating its settlers to Bermuda.\n\n==Formation of the Somers Isles Company==\nThe Virginia Company ran Bermuda until 1613, when the colony was transferred to Sir [[William Wade (English politician)|William Wade]] et cetera in exchange for \u00a32,000, who then resigned to the Crown in 1614. The Crown briefly adminstered the Colony directly before the adventurers (shareholders) of the Virginia Company formed a second company, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda was transferred in 1615. The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1622, with the administration of its continental colony passing to [[the Crown]]. The Somers Isles Company, with its separate charter, continued to administer Bermuda for another six decades.\n\nThe original Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company listed in the letters patent were essentially the same as those of the Virginia Company.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.

This approach, which does not require wireless controller hardware, is ideal for deployments with a high-density of mobile users, such as hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, schools, conference centers, assisted living facilities, and [[Multi-Dwelling Unit]]s (MDUs) such as apartment buildings. This method of instantiating a wireless network does not require onsite [[wireless LAN controller]] hardware; as the access points are managed via the cloud network. Ostensibly this reduces equipment costs and eases management. This technology also enables businesses or [[Value-added reseller|Value-Added Resellers]] to create multiple private wireless networks using the same public access infrastructure.\n\n===Skydog===\nSkydog is a combination [[802.11n]] [[Wireless router|Wi-Fi router]], cloud service and [[HTML5]]-based application. Skydog gives consumer visibility into and control over the home Wi-Fi network. They can view and control any device connected to the network and prioritize resources by user, device or application. The solution was a consumer version of the company's enterprise product.\n\nSkydog's capabilities represent a break from historical use of Wi-Fi routers, most of which were primarily used to provide wireless connectivity to a household's Internet connection and little else. Some existing high-end routers allow for remote access and the instantiation of parental controls. Skydog claimed their cloud solution integrated parental controls, a mobile experience, and more granular control over specific devices, users, and applications connecting to the home network.

This approach, which does not require wireless controller hardware, is ideal for deployments with a high-density of mobile users, such as hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, schools, conference centers, assisted living facilities, and [[Multi-Dwelling Unit]]s (MDUs) such as apartment buildings. This method of instantiating a wireless network does not require onsite [[wireless LAN controller]] hardware; as the access points are managed via the cloud network. Ostensibly this reduces equipment costs and eases management. This technology also enables businesses or [[Value-added reseller|Value-Added Resellers]] to create multiple private wireless networks using the same public access infrastructure.\n\n===Skydog===\nSkydog is a combination [[802.11n]] [[Wireless router|Wi-Fi router]], cloud service and [[HTML5]]-based application. Skydog gives consumer visibility into and control over the home Wi-Fi network. They can view and control any device connected to the network and prioritize resources by user, device or application. The solution was a consumer version of the company's enterprise product.\n\nSkydog's capabilities represent a break from historical use of Wi-Fi routers, most of which were primarily used to provide wireless connectivity to a household's Internet connection and little else. Some existing high-end routers allow for remote access and the instantiation of parental controls. Skydog claimed their cloud solution integrated parental controls, a mobile experience, and more granular control over specific devices, users, and applications connecting to the home network. Consumers could then better control distribution of bandwidth and monitor activity on their network. PowerCloud Systems marketed the solution primarily to families with children using the Internet, saying that it allows parents to better understand and manage how their kids use the Web.\n\nSkydog was originally funded via Kickstarter in Spring 2013.

Cort\u00e9s was part of the generation of Spanish explorers and conquistadors who began the first phase of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].\n\nBorn in [[Medell\u00edn, Spain]], to a family of lesser [[nobility]], Cort\u00e9s chose to pursue adventure and riches in the [[New World]]. He went to [[Hispaniola]] and later to [[Cuba]], where he received an ''[[encomienda]]'' (the right to the labor of certain subjects). For a short time, he served as ''[[alcalde]]'' (magistrate) of the second Spanish town founded on the island. In 1519, he was elected captain of the third expedition to the mainland, which he partly funded. His enmity with the Governor of Cuba, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], resulted in the recall of the expedition at the last moment, an order which Cort\u00e9s ignored.\n\nArriving on the continent, Cort\u00e9s executed a successful strategy of allying with some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] against others. He also used a native woman, [[La Malinche|Do\u00f1a Marina]], as an [[interpreter]]. She later bore his first son. When the Governor of Cuba sent emissaries to arrest Cort\u00e9s, he fought them and won, using the extra troops as reinforcements. Cort\u00e9s wrote letters directly to the king asking to be acknowledged for his successes instead of being punished for mutiny. After he overthrew the [[Aztec Empire]], Cort\u00e9s was awarded the title of ''[[Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca|Marqu\u00e9s del Valle de Oaxaca]]'', while the more prestigious title of [[New Spain|Viceroy]] was given to a high-ranking nobleman, [[Antonio de Mendoza]]. In 1541 Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain, where he died six years later of natural causes but embittered.\n\nBecause of the controversial undertakings of Cort\u00e9s and the scarcity of reliable sources of information about him, it is difficult to describe his personality or motivations. Early lionizing of the conquistadores did not encourage deep examination of Cort\u00e9s. Modern reconsideration has done little to enlarge understanding regarding him. As a result of these historical trends, descriptions of Cort\u00e9s tend to be simplistic, and either damning or idealizing.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Name==\n{{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n{{See also|Spanish naming customs}}\n\nCort\u00e9s himself used the form \"Hernando\" or \"Fernando\" for his first name, as seen in his signature and the title of an early portrait.<ref>See information box for his signature and painting.</ref> [[William Hickling Prescott]]'s ''Conquest of Mexico'' (1843) also refers to him as Hernando Cort\u00e9s.  At some point writers began using the shortened form of \"Hern\u00e1n\" more generally.\n\n==Early life==\nCort\u00e9s was born in 1485 in the town of [[Medell\u00edn (Spain)|Medell\u00edn]], then a village in the [[Kingdom of Castile]], now a municipality of the modern-day [[provinces of Spain|province]] of [[Badajoz (province)|Badajoz]] in [[Extremadura]], [[Spain]]. His father, Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s de Monroy, born in 1449 to Rodrigo or Ruy Fern\u00e1ndez de Monroy and his wife Mar\u00eda Cort\u00e9s, was an [[infantry]] [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] of distinguished ancestry but slender means. Hern\u00e1n's mother was Catal\u00edna Pizarro Altamirano.<ref name=\"Machado, J. T 1970\">Machado, J. T. Montalv\u00e3o, ''Dos Pizarros de Espanha aos de Portugal e Brasil'', Author's Edition, 1st Edition, Lisbon, 1970.</ref>\n\nThrough his mother, Hern\u00e1n was second cousin once removed of [[Francisco Pizarro]], who later conquered the [[Inca Empire]] of modern-day [[Peru]], and not to be confused with another Francisco Pizarro, who joined Cort\u00e9s to conquer the [[Aztec]]s. (His maternal grandmother, Leonor S\u00e1nchez Pizarro Altamirano, was first cousin of Pizarro's father Gonazalo Pizarro y Rodriguez.)<ref name=\"Machado, J. T 1970\"/> Through his father, Hern\u00e1n was related to [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]], the third [[Governor of Hispaniola]]. His paternal great-grandfather was [[Rodrigo de Monroy y Almaraz, 5th Lord of Monroy]].\n\nAccording to his [[biographer]], [[chaplain]], and friend [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]], Cort\u00e9s was pale and sickly as a child. At the age of 14, he was sent to study Latin under an uncle in Salamanca. Modern historians have misconstrued this personal tutoring as time enrolled at the University of Salamanca.<ref>David A.

However, those two years in [[Salamanca]], plus his long period of training and experience as a notary, first in Valladolid and later in [[Hispaniola]], gave him knowledge of the legal codes of Castile that he applied to help justify his unauthorized conquest of Mexico.<ref>Boruchoff, \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s,\" [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Hernan_Cortes.aspx Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s], ''Encyclopedia</ref>\n\nAt this point in his life, Cort\u00e9s was described by G\u00f3mara as ruthless, haughty, and mischievous.<ref name=\"Hernan Cort\u00e9s\">[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/imperialism/notes/cortez.html Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, \"Hernan Cort\u00e9s\"], The Latin Library</ref> The 16-year-old youth had returned home to feel constrained life in his small provincial town.

(This island is now divided between [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]). Cort\u00e9s suffered an injury and was prevented from traveling. He spent the next year wandering the country, probably spending most of his time in Spain's southern ports of [[Cadiz]], [[Palos de la Frontera|Palos]], [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda|Sanlucar]], and [[Seville]]. He finally left for Hispaniola in 1504 and became a colonist.<ref>Crow, John A. ''The Epic of Latin America''. Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 1992. 4th ed. p. 73</ref>\n\n===Arrival===\nCort\u00e9s reached Hispaniola in a ship commanded by Alonso Quintero, who tried to deceive his superiors and reach the New World before them in order to secure personal advantages. Quintero's mutinous conduct may have served as a model for Cort\u00e9s in his subsequent career. The history of the conquistadores is rife with accounts of rivalry, jockeying for positions, mutiny, and betrayal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coloquio.com/famosos/cortes.htm |title=Famous Hispanics: Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s |publisher=Coloquio.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref>\n\nUpon his arrival in 1504 in [[Santo Domingo]], the capital of Hispaniola, the 18-year-old Cort\u00e9s registered as a citizen; this entitled him to a building plot and land to farm. Soon afterward, Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando granted him an ''[[encomienda]]'' and appointed him as a notary of the town of [[Azua de Compostela]]. His next five years seemed to help establish him in the colony; in 1506, Cort\u00e9s took part in the conquest of Hispaniola and Cuba. The expedition leader awarded him a large estate of land and Indian slaves for his efforts.\n\n===Cuba (1511\u20131519)===\nIn 1511, Cort\u00e9s  accompanied [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], an aide of the Governor of Hispaniola, in his expedition to conquer Cuba. Vel\u00e1zquez was appointed [[Governor of New Spain]]. At the age of 26, Cort\u00e9s was made clerk to the treasurer with the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown received the ''quinto'', or customary one fifth of the profits from the expedition.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez was so impressed with Cort\u00e9s that he secured a high political position for him in the colony. He became secretary for Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. Cort\u00e9s was twice appointed municipal magistrate (''[[alcalde]]'') of [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]]. In Cuba, Cort\u00e9s became a man of substance with an ''[[encomienda]]'' to provide Indian labor for his mines and cattle. This new position of power also made him the new source of leadership, which opposing forces in the colony could then turn to. In 1514, Cort\u00e9s led a group which demanded that more Indians be assigned to the settlers.\n\nAs time went on, relations between Cort\u00e9s and Governor Vel\u00e1zquez became strained.<ref name=Hassig94>Hassig, Ross. ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman Group UK Limited, 1994, pp. 45\u201346</ref> This began once news reached Vel\u00e1zquez that [[Juan de Grijalva]] had established a colony on the mainland where there was a bonanza of silver and gold, and Vel\u00e1zquez decided to send him help. Cort\u00e9s was appointed [[Captain-General]] of this new expedition in October 1518, but was advised to move fast before Vel\u00e1zquez changed his mind.<ref name=Hassig94/>\n\nWith Cort\u00e9s' experience as an administrator, knowledge gained from many failed expeditions, and his impeccable rhetoric he was able to gather six ships and 300 men, within a month. Vel\u00e1zquez's jealousy exploded and he decided to put the expedition in other hands. However, Cort\u00e9s quickly gathered more men and ships in other Cuban ports.\n\nCort\u00e9s also found time to become romantically involved with Catalina Xu\u00e1rez (or Ju\u00e1rez), the sister-in-law of Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. Part of Vel\u00e1zquez's displeasure seems to have been based on a belief that Cort\u00e9s was trifling with Catalina's affections. Cort\u00e9s was temporarily distracted by one of Catalina's sisters but finally married Catalina, reluctantly, under pressure from Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. However, by doing so, he hoped to secure the good will of both her family and that of Vel\u00e1zquez.<ref>Sanderson Beck, [http://www.san.beck.org/11-2-SpanishConquest.html#3 \"Cort\u00e8s in Mexico\"]</ref>\n\nIt was not until he had been almost 15 years in the Indies that Cort\u00e9s began to look beyond his substantial status as mayor of the capital of Cuba and as a man of affairs in the thriving colony. He missed the first two expeditions, under the orders of [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (discoverer of Yucat\u00e1n)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] and then [[Juan de Grijalva]], sent by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez to [[Mexico]] in 1518.\n\n== Destroying the ships ==\nThere are differing perceptions about what happened to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's ships.

At the last minute, due to the old argument between the two, Vel\u00e1zquez changed his mind and revoked Cort\u00e9s's charter. He ignored the orders and, in an act of open [[mutiny]], went anyway in February 1519. He stopped in [[Trinidad, Cuba]], to hire more soldiers and obtain more horses.

The [[Otomi people|Otomis]] initially, and then the [[Tlaxcalans]] fought with the Spanish in a series of three battles from 2 to 5 September 1519, and at one point, Diaz remarked, \"they surrounded us on every side\".

Catalina lacked the noble title of ''do\u00f1a,'' so at this point his marriage with her no longer raised his status. Their marriage had been childless. Since Cort\u00e9s had sired children with a variety of indigenous women, including a son around 1522 by his cultural translator, [[La Malinche|Do\u00f1a Marina]], Cort\u00e9s knew he was capable of fathering children. Cort\u00e9s's only male heir at this point was illegitimate, but nonetheless named after Cort\u00e9s's father, Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s.

In 1529 he had been accorded the noble designation of ''[[Don (honorific)|don]]'', but more importantly was given the noble title of Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca and married the Spanish noblewoman Do\u00f1a Juana de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga.

During the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery|Catholic Church]] had seen early attempts at conversion in the Caribbean islands by Spanish friars, particularly the mendicant orders. Cort\u00e9s made a request to the Spanish monarch to send [[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars to Mexico to convert the vast indigenous populations to Christianity. In his fourth letter to the king, Cort\u00e9s pleaded for friars rather than diocesan or secular priests because those clerics were in his view a serious danger to the Indians' conversion.\n\n<blockquote>If these people [Indians] were now to see the affairs of the Church and the service of God in the hands of canons or other dignitaries, and saw them indulge in the vices and profanities now common in Spain, knowing that such men were the ministers of God, it would bring our Faith into much harm that I believe any further preaching would be of no avail.<ref>Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, ''Letters from Mexico'', translated and edited by A.R. Pagden. New York: Grossman Publishers, 1971, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe wished the mendicants to be the main evangelists.  Mendicant friars did not usually have full priestly powers to perform all the sacraments needed for conversion of the Indians and growth of the neophytes in the Christian faith, so Cort\u00e9s laid out a solution to this to the king.\n\n<blockquote>Your Majesty should likewise beseech His Holiness [the pope] to grant these powers to the two principal persons in the religious orders that are to come here, and that they should be his delegates, one from the Order of St. Francis and the other from the Order of St. Dominic. They should bring the most extensive powers Your Majesty is able to obtain, for, because these lands are so far from the Church of Rome, and we, the Christians who now reside here and shall do so in the future, are so far from the proper remedies of our consciences and, as we are human, so subject to sin, it is essential that His Holiness should be generous with us and grant to these persons most extensive powers, to be handed down to persons actually in residence here whether it be given to the general of each order or to his provincials.<ref>Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, ''Letters from Mexico'', translated and edited by A.R. Pagden. New York: Grossman Publishers, 1971, p. 334</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Franciscans arrived in May 1524, a symbolically powerful group of twelve known as the [[Twelve Apostles of Mexico]], led by Fray [[Mart\u00edn de Valencia]].  Franciscan [[Geronimo de Mendieta]] claimed that Cort\u00e9s's most important deed was the way he met this first group of Franciscans. The conqueror himself was said to have met the friars as they approached the capital, kneeling at the feet of the friars who had walked from the coast. This story was told by Franciscans to demonstrate Cort\u00e9s piety and humility and was a powerful message to all, including the Indians, that Cort\u00e9s's earthly power was subordinate to the spiritual power of the friars. However, one of the first twelve Franciscans, Fray [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]] does not mention it in his history.<ref>John Leddy Phelan, ''The Snake Person Kingdom of the Franciscans in the New World,'' chapter 3, \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, the Moses of the New World,\" Berkeley: University of California Press, second edition, revised, 1971, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> Cort\u00e9s and the Franciscans had a particularly strong alliance in Mexico, with Franciscans seeing him as \"the new Moses\" for conquering Mexico and opening it to Christian evangelization. In Motolinia's 1555 response to Dominican [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], he praises Cort\u00e9s.\n\n<blockquote>And as to those who murmur against the Marqu\u00e9s del Valle [Cort\u00e9s], God rest him, and who try to blacken and obscure his deeds, I believe that before God their deeds are not as acceptable as those of the Marqu\u00e9s. Although as a human he was a sinner, he had faith and works of a good Christian, and a great desire to employ his life and property in widening and augmenting the fair of Jesus Christ, and dying for the conversion of these gentiles ... Who has loved and defended the Indians of this new world like Cort\u00e9s? ... Through this captain, God opened the door for us to preach his holy gospel and it was he who caused the Indians to revere the holy sacraments and respect the ministers of the church.<ref>Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, \"The Franciscan reply (to the Dominicans) in ''Letters and People of the Spanish Indies, Sixteenth Century,'' translated and edited by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and Enrique Otte.

Whereas Book XII of the Florentine Codex concludes with an account of Spaniards' search for gold, in Sahag\u00fan's 1585 revised account, he ends with praise of Cort\u00e9s for requesting the Franciscans be sent to Mexico to convert the Indians.<ref>Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, ''Conquest of New Spain, 1585 Revision,'' translated by Howard F.

Fearing that [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] might head an insurrection in Mexico, he brought him with him to Honduras. In a controversial move, Cuauht\u00e9moc was executed during the journey. Raging over Olid's treason, Cort\u00e9s issued a decree to arrest Vel\u00e1zquez, whom he was sure was behind Olid's treason.

In 1521, year of the Conquest, Charles was attending to matters in his German domains and Bishop [[Adrian of Utrecht]] functioned as regent in Spain.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez and Fonseca persuaded the regent to appoint a commissioner (a ''[[Juez de residencia]]'', [[Luis Ponce de Le\u00f3n (governor of New Spain)|Luis Ponce de Le\u00f3n]]) with powers to investigate Cort\u00e9s's conduct and even arrest him.

The Licentiate then fell ill and died shortly after his arrival, appointing [[Marcos de Aguilar]] as ''alcalde mayor''. The aged Aguilar also became sick and appointed [[Alonso de Estrada]] governor, who was confirmed in his functions by a royal decree in August 1527. Cort\u00e9s, suspected of poisoning them, refrained from taking over the government.\n\nEstrada sent Diego de Figueroa to the south. De Figueroa raided graveyards and extorted contributions, meeting his end when the ship carrying these treasures sank. Albornoz persuaded Alonso de Estrada to release [[Gonzalo de Salazar]] and Chirinos. When Cort\u00e9s complained angrily after one of his adherents' hands was cut off, Estrada ordered him exiled. Cort\u00e9s sailed for Spain in 1528 to appeal to King Charles.\n\n===First return to Spain (1528) and Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca===\n[[Image:Jakob Seisenegger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''Emperor Charles V with Hound'' (1532), a painting by the 16th-century artist [[Jakob Seisenegger]].]]\nIn 1528, Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain to appeal to the justice of his master, Charles V. Juan Altamirano and [[Alonso Valiente]] stayed in Mexico and acted as Cort\u00e9s' representatives during his absence. Cort\u00e9s presented himself with great splendor before Charles V's court. By this time Charles had returned and Cort\u00e9s forthrightly responded to his enemy's charges. Denying he had held back on gold due the crown, he showed that he had contributed more than the quinto (one-fifth) required. Indeed, he had spent lavishly to build the new capital of Mexico City on the ruins of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, leveled during the siege that brought down the Aztec empire.\n\nHe was received by Charles with every distinction, and decorated with the [[order of Santiago]]. In return for his efforts in expanding the still young [[Spanish Empire]], Cort\u00e9s was rewarded in 1529 by being accorded the noble title of ''[[Don (honorific)|don]]'' but more importantly named the ''\"Marqu\u00e9s del Valle de [[Oaxaca]]\"'' ([[Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca|Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca]] and married the Spanish noblewoman Do\u00f1a Juana Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, after the 1522 death of his much less distinguished first wife, Catalina Su\u00e1rez.  The noble title and senorial estate of the Marquesado was passed down to his descendants until 1811. The Oaxaca Valley was one of the wealthiest regions of New Spain, and Cort\u00e9s had 23,000 [[vassal]]s in 23 named [[encomiendas]] in perpetuity.<ref name=Grunberg/><ref>Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521\u20131555.

During his travel to Spain, his property was mismanaged by abusive colonial administrators. He sided with local natives in a lawsuit. The natives documented the abuses in the [[Huexotzinco Codex]].\n\nThe entailed estate and title passed to his legitimate son Don [[Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, 2nd Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca|Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s]] upon Cort\u00e9s's death in 1547, who became the Second Marquess. Don Mart\u00edn's association with the so-called Encomenderos' Conspiracy endangered the entailed holdings, but they were restored and remained the continuing reward for Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's family through the generations.\n\n===Return to Mexico===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\n[[Image:Hernan Fernando Cortes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, with his coat of arms on the upper left corner. 16th c.

Although Cort\u00e9s still retained military authority and permission to continue his conquests, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] was appointed in 1535 to administer New Spain's civil affairs. This division of power led to continual dissension, and caused the failure of several enterprises in which Cort\u00e9s was engaged.\n\nOn returning to Mexico, Cort\u00e9s found the country in a state of [[anarchy]]. There was a strong suspicion in court circles of an intended rebellion by Cort\u00e9s, and a charge was brought against him that cast a fatal blight upon his character and plans. He was accused of murdering his first wife. The proceedings of the investigation were kept secret.\n\nNo report, either exonerating or condemning Cort\u00e9s, was published. Had the Government declared him innocent, it would have greatly increased his popularity. Had it declared him a criminal, a crisis would have been precipitated by the accused and his party. Silence was the only safe policy, but that silence is suggestive that grave danger was feared from his influence.\n\nAfter reasserting his position and reestablishing some sort of order, Cort\u00e9s retired to his estates at [[Palace of Cort\u00e9s, Cuernavaca|Cuernavaca]], about 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) south of Mexico City. There he concentrated on the building of his palace and on Pacific exploration. Remaining in Mexico between 1530 and 1541, Cort\u00e9s quarreled with [[Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n]] and disputed the right to explore the territory that is today [[California]] with [[Antonio de Mendoza]], the first viceroy.\n\nCort\u00e9s acquired several silver mines in [[Zumpango del Rio]] in 1534.  By the early 1540s, he owned 20 silver mines in [[Sultepec]], 12 in [[Taxco]], and 3 in [[Zacualpan, State of Mexico|Zacualpan]].  Earlier, Cort\u00e9s had claimed the silver in the [[Tamazula de Gordiano|Tamazula]] area.<ref name=\"Bakewell\">{{cite book|author=West, Robert.

Cort\u00e9s also spent time exploring the Pacific coast of Mexico. The [[Gulf of California]] was originally named the ''Sea of Cort\u00e9s'' by its discoverer [[Francisco de Ulloa]] in 1539.

In February 1544 he made a claim on the royal treasury, but was ignored for the next three years. Disgusted, he decided to return to Mexico in 1547. When he reached Seville, he was stricken with [[dysentery]]. He died in [[Castilleja de la Cuesta]], [[Seville]] province, on December 2, 1547, from a case of [[pleurisy]] at the age of 62.\n\nHe left his many [[mestizo]] and white children well cared for in his will, along with every one of their mothers. He requested in his will that his remains eventually be buried in Mexico. Before he died he had the Pope remove the \"natural\" status of four of his children (legitimizing them in the eyes of the church), including [[Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s (son of do\u00f1a Marina)|Martin]], the son he had with Do\u00f1a Marina (also known as La Malinche), said to be his favourite.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} His daughter, Do\u00f1a Catalina, however, died shortly after her father's death.\n[[File:Busto de Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in the [[General Archive of the Indies]] in [[Seville]]]]\nAfter his death, his body was moved more than eight times for several reasons. On December 4, 1547 he was buried in the [[mausoleum]] of the Duke of Medina in the church of San Isidoro del Campo, Sevilla. Three years later (1550) due to the space being required by the duke, his body was moved to the altar of Santa Catarina in the same church. In his testament, Cort\u00e9s asked for his body to be buried in the monastery he had ordered to be built in Coyoacan in M\u00e9xico, ten years after his death, but the monastery was never built. So in 1566, his body was sent to New Spain and buried in the church of  San Francisco de Texcoco, where his mother and one of his sisters were buried.\n[[File:Tumba de Cort\u00e9s.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Cort\u00e9s in the Hospital de Jes\u00fas Nazareno, which he founded in Mexico City.]]\nIn 1629, ''Don Pedro Cort\u00e9s fourth \"Marquez del Valle'', his last male descendant, died, so the viceroy decided to move the bones of Cort\u00e9s along with those of his descendant to the Franciscan church in M\u00e9xico. This was delayed for nine years, while his body stayed in the main room of the palace of the viceroy. Eventually it was moved to the Sagrario of  Franciscan church, where it stayed for 87 years. In 1716, it was moved to another place in the same church. In 1794, his bones were moved to the \"[[Hospital de Jes\u00fas Nazareno|Hospital de Jesus]]\" (founded by Cort\u00e9s), where a statue by [[Manuel Tols\u00e1|Tols\u00e1]] and a mausoleum were made.

(\"Cortez\", p. 60).</ref>\n\n==Disputed interpretation of his life==\n\nThere are relatively few sources to the early life of Cort\u00e9s; his fame arose from his participation in the conquest of Mexico and it was only after this that people became interested in reading and writing about him.\n\nProbably the best source is his letters to the king which he wrote during the campaign in Mexico, but they are written with the specific purpose of putting his efforts in a favourable light and so must be read critically. Another main source is the biography written by Cort\u00e9s's private chaplain [[Lopez de G\u00f3mara]], which was written in Spain several years after the conquest. G\u00f3mara never set foot in the Americas and knew only what Cort\u00e9s had told him, and he had an affinity for knightly romantic stories which he incorporated richly in the biography. The third major source is written as a reaction to what its author calls \"the lies of Gomara\", the eyewitness account written by the Conquistador [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] does not paint Cort\u00e9s as a [[romantic hero]] but rather tries to emphasize that Cort\u00e9s's men should also be remembered as important participants in the undertakings in Mexico.\n[[File:1000 pesetas, 12 de octubre de 1992, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|1000 Spanish peseta note issued in 1992]]\nIn the years following the conquest more critical accounts of the Spanish arrival in Mexico were written. The [[Dominican friar]] [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]] wrote his ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'' which raises strong accusations of brutality and heinous violence towards the Indians; accusations against both the conquistadors in general and Cort\u00e9s in particular.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/515/ |title=Mirror of the Cruel and Horrible Spanish Tyranny Perpetrated in the Netherlands, by the Tyrant, the Duke of Alba, and Other Commanders of King Philip II |work=[[World Digital Library]] |year=1620 |access-date=25 August 2013 |last=de las Casas |first=Bartolom\u00e9 |author-link=Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas |last2=Gysius |first2=Johannes |author2-link=Johannes Gysius |editor-last=Lons |editor-first=Dirck Eversen |editor2-last=Vinckeboons |editor2-first=David |editor2-link=David Vinckboons |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref> The accounts of the conquest given in the [[Florentine Codex]] by the Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] and his native informants are also less than flattering towards Cort\u00e9s. The scarcity of these sources has led to a sharp division in the description of Cort\u00e9s's personality and a tendency to describe him as either a vicious and ruthless person or a noble and honorable cavalier.\n\n===Representations in Mexico===\n[[Image:Monumento de Moctezuma y Hernan Cort\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|Monument in [[Mexico City]] commemorating the encounter of Cort\u00e9s and Moctezuma at the Hospital de Jes\u00fas Nazareno.]]\nIn M\u00e9xico there are few representations of Cort\u00e9s. However, many landmarks still bear his name, from the castle [[Palace of Cortes, Cuernavaca|Palacio de Cort\u00e9s]] in the city of [[Cuernavaca]] to some street names throughout the republic.\n\nThe pass between the volcanoes [[Iztacc\u00edhuatl]] and [[Popocat\u00e9petl]] where Cort\u00e9s took his soldiers on their march to Mexico City. It is known as the [[Paso de Cort\u00e9s]].\n\nThe [[mural]]ist [[Diego Rivera]] painted several representation of him but the most famous, depicts him as a powerful and ominous figure along with Malinche in a mural in the [[National Palace of Mexico|National Palace]] in Mexico City.\n\n[[Image:Monumento al Mestizaje.jpg|thumb|left|Monument in Mexico City known as \"Monumento al Mestizaje\".]]\nIn 1981, President [[Lopez Portillo]] tried to bring Cort\u00e9s to public recognition. First, he made public a copy of the bust of Cort\u00e9s made by [[Manuel Tols\u00e1]] in the [[Hospital de Jes\u00fas Nazareno]] with an official ceremony, but soon a nationalist group tried to destroy it, so it had to be taken out of the public.<ref name=\"letraslibres1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.letraslibres.com/index.php?art=9040 |title=Reconocer a Cort\u00e9s |first=Leonardo |last=Tarife\u00f1o |work=Letras Libres |date=September 2003 |access-date=23 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720144235/http://www.letraslibres.com/index.php?art=9040 |archive-date=20 July 2011 |publisher=Editorial Vuelta}}</ref>  Today the copy of the bust is in the \"Hospital de Jes\u00fas Nazareno\" <ref>{{cite web |url=http://rutastranquilas.blogspot.com/2011_01_01_archive.html |title=Recuerdos de Espa\u00f1a en Mexico: Hern\u00e1n Cortes |date=5 February 2003 |access-date=19 February 2011 |author=MariaRosa |work=[[BlogSpot]]}}</ref> while the original is in Naples, Italy, in the [[Villa Pignatelli]].\n\nLater, another monument, known as \"Monumento al Mestizaje\" by Juli\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez y M.

It was published for the first time in volume IV of \"Documentos para la Historia de Espa\u00f1a\", and subsequently reprinted. \n\nThe ''Segunda Carta de Relacion'', bearing the date of October 30, 1520, appeared in print at [[Seville]] in 1522. The [[Third letter of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s to the Emperor Charles V|third letter]], dated May 15, 1522, appeared at Seville in 1523. The fourth, October 20, 1524, was printed at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1525. The fifth, on the Honduras expedition, is contained in volume IV of the ''Documentos para la Historia de Espa\u00f1a''. The important letter mentioned in the text has been published under the heading of ''Carta in\u00e9dita de Cort\u00e9s'' by Ycazbalceta. A great number of minor documents, either by Cort\u00e9s or others, for or against him, are dispersed through the voluminous collection above cited and through the ''Colecci\u00f3n de Documentos de Indias'', as well as in the ''Documentos para la Historia de M\u00e9xico'' of Ycazbalceta.

Cort\u00e9s was part of the generation of Spanish colonizers who began the first phase of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].\n\nBorn in [[Medell\u00edn, Spain]], to a family of lesser [[nobility]], Cort\u00e9s chose to pursue adventure and riches in the [[New World]]. He went to [[Hispaniola]] and later to [[Cuba]], where he received an ''[[encomienda]]'' (the right to the labor of certain subjects). For a short time, he served as ''[[alcalde]]'' (magistrate) of the second Spanish town founded on the island. In 1519, he was elected captain of the third expedition to the mainland, which he partly funded. His enmity with the Governor of Cuba, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], resulted in the recall of the expedition at the last moment, an order which Cort\u00e9s ignored.\n\nArriving on the continent, Cort\u00e9s executed a successful strategy of allying with some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] against others. He also used a native woman, [[La Malinche|Do\u00f1a Marina]], as an [[interpreter]]. She later bore his first son. When the Governor of Cuba sent emissaries to arrest Cort\u00e9s, he fought them and won, using the extra troops as reinforcements. Cort\u00e9s wrote letters directly to the king asking to be acknowledged for his successes instead of being punished for mutiny. After he overthrew the [[Aztec Empire]], Cort\u00e9s was awarded the title of ''[[Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca|Marqu\u00e9s del Valle de Oaxaca]]'', while the more prestigious title of [[New Spain|Viceroy]] was given to a high-ranking nobleman, [[Antonio de Mendoza]]. In 1541 Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain, where he died six years later of natural causes but embittered.\n\nBecause of the controversial undertakings of Cort\u00e9s and the scarcity of reliable sources of information about him, it is difficult to describe his personality or motivations. Early lionizing of the conquistadores did not encourage deep examination of Cort\u00e9s. Modern reconsideration has done little to enlarge understanding regarding him. As a result of these historical trends, descriptions of Cort\u00e9s tend to be simplistic, and either damning or idealizing.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Name==\n{{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n{{See also|Spanish naming customs}}\n\nCort\u00e9s himself used the form \"Hernando\" or \"Fernando\" for his first name, as seen in his signature and the title of an early portrait.<ref>See information box for his signature and painting.</ref> [[William Hickling Prescott]]'s ''Conquest of Mexico'' (1843) also refers to him as Hernando Cort\u00e9s.  At some point writers began using the shortened form of \"Hern\u00e1n\" more generally.\n\n==Early life==\nCort\u00e9s was born in 1485 in the town of [[Medell\u00edn (Spain)|Medell\u00edn]], then a village in the [[Kingdom of Castile]], now a municipality of the modern-day [[provinces of Spain|province]] of [[Badajoz (province)|Badajoz]] in [[Extremadura]], [[Spain]]. His father, Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s de Monroy, born in 1449 to Rodrigo or Ruy Fern\u00e1ndez de Monroy and his wife Mar\u00eda Cort\u00e9s, was an [[infantry]] [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] of distinguished ancestry but slender means. Hern\u00e1n's mother was Catal\u00edna Pizarro Altamirano.<ref name=\"Machado, J. T 1970\">Machado, J. T. Montalv\u00e3o, ''Dos Pizarros de Espanha aos de Portugal e Brasil'', Author's Edition, 1st Edition, Lisbon, 1970.</ref>\n\nThrough his mother, Hern\u00e1n was second cousin once removed of [[Francisco Pizarro]], who later conquered the [[Inca Empire]] of modern-day [[Peru]], and not to be confused with another Francisco Pizarro, who joined Cort\u00e9s to conquer the [[Aztec]]s. (His maternal grandmother, Leonor S\u00e1nchez Pizarro Altamirano, was first cousin of Pizarro's father Gonazalo Pizarro y Rodriguez.)<ref name=\"Machado, J. T 1970\"/> Through his father, Hern\u00e1n was related to [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]], the third [[Governor of Hispaniola]]. His paternal great-grandfather was [[Rodrigo de Monroy y Almaraz, 5th Lord of Monroy]].\n\nAccording to his [[biographer]], [[chaplain]], and friend [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]], Cort\u00e9s was pale and sickly as a child. At the age of 14, he was sent to study Latin under an uncle in Salamanca. Modern historians have misconstrued this personal tutoring as time enrolled at the University of Salamanca.<ref>David A. Boruchoff, \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s,\" ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', 2nd. ed. (2008), vol. 2, pp. 146\u201349 [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Hernan_Cortes.aspx Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]</ref>\n\nAfter two years, Cort\u00e9s returned home to Medell\u00edn, much to the irritation of his parents, who had hoped to see him equipped for a profitable legal career. However, those two years in [[Salamanca]], plus his long period of training and experience as a notary, first in Valladolid and later in [[Hispaniola]], gave him knowledge of the legal codes of Castile that he applied to help justify his unauthorized conquest of Mexico.<ref>Boruchoff, \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s,\" [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Hernan_Cortes.aspx Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s], ''Encyclopedia</ref>\n\nAt this point in his life, Cort\u00e9s was described by G\u00f3mara as ruthless, haughty, and mischievous.<ref name=\"Hernan Cort\u00e9s\">[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/imperialism/notes/cortez.html Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, \"Hernan Cort\u00e9s\"], The Latin Library</ref> The 16-year-old youth had returned home to feel constrained life in his small provincial town. By this time, news of the exciting discoveries of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the New World was streaming back to Spain.\n\n==Early career in the New World==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2019}}\nPlans were made for Cort\u00e9s to sail to the Americas with a family acquaintance and distant relative, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]], the newly appointed [[Governor of Hispaniola]]. (This island is now divided between [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]). Cort\u00e9s suffered an injury and was prevented from traveling. He spent the next year wandering the country, probably spending most of his time in Spain's southern ports of [[Cadiz]], [[Palos de la Frontera|Palos]], [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda|Sanlucar]], and [[Seville]]. He finally left for Hispaniola in 1504 and became a colonist.<ref>Crow, John A. ''The Epic of Latin America''. Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 1992. 4th ed. p. 73</ref>\n\n===Arrival===\nCort\u00e9s reached Hispaniola in a ship commanded by Alonso Quintero, who tried to deceive his superiors and reach the New World before them in order to secure personal advantages. Quintero's mutinous conduct may have served as a model for Cort\u00e9s in his subsequent career. The history of the conquistadores is rife with accounts of rivalry, jockeying for positions, mutiny, and betrayal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coloquio.com/famosos/cortes.htm |title=Famous Hispanics: Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s |publisher=Coloquio.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref>\n\nUpon his arrival in 1504 in [[Santo Domingo]], the capital of Hispaniola, the 18-year-old Cort\u00e9s registered as a citizen; this entitled him to a building plot and land to farm. Soon afterward, Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando granted him an ''[[encomienda]]'' and appointed him as a notary of the town of [[Azua de Compostela]]. His next five years seemed to help establish him in the colony; in 1506, Cort\u00e9s took part in the conquest of Hispaniola and Cuba. The expedition leader awarded him a large estate of land and Indian slaves for his efforts.\n\n===Cuba (1511\u20131519)===\nIn 1511, Cort\u00e9s  accompanied [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], an aide of the Governor of Hispaniola, in his expedition to conquer Cuba. Vel\u00e1zquez was appointed [[Governor of New Spain]]. At the age of 26, Cort\u00e9s was made clerk to the treasurer with the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown received the ''quinto'', or customary one fifth of the profits from the expedition.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez was so impressed with Cort\u00e9s that he secured a high political position for him in the colony. He became secretary for Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. Cort\u00e9s was twice appointed municipal magistrate (''[[alcalde]]'') of [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]]. In Cuba, Cort\u00e9s became a man of substance with an ''[[encomienda]]'' to provide Indian labor for his mines and cattle. This new position of power also made him the new source of leadership, which opposing forces in the colony could then turn to. In 1514, Cort\u00e9s led a group which demanded that more Indians be assigned to the settlers.\n\nAs time went on, relations between Cort\u00e9s and Governor Vel\u00e1zquez became strained.<ref name=Hassig94>Hassig, Ross. ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman Group UK Limited, 1994, pp. 45\u201346</ref> This began once news reached Vel\u00e1zquez that [[Juan de Grijalva]] had established a colony on the mainland where there was a bonanza of silver and gold, and Vel\u00e1zquez decided to send him help. Cort\u00e9s was appointed [[Captain-General]] of this new expedition in October 1518, but was advised to move fast before Vel\u00e1zquez changed his mind.<ref name=Hassig94/>\n\nWith Cort\u00e9s' experience as an administrator, knowledge gained from many failed expeditions, and his impeccable rhetoric he was able to gather six ships and 300 men, within a month. Vel\u00e1zquez's jealousy exploded and he decided to put the expedition in other hands. However, Cort\u00e9s quickly gathered more men and ships in other Cuban ports.\n\nCort\u00e9s also found time to become romantically involved with Catalina Xu\u00e1rez (or Ju\u00e1rez), the sister-in-law of Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. Part of Vel\u00e1zquez's displeasure seems to have been based on a belief that Cort\u00e9s was trifling with Catalina's affections. Cort\u00e9s was temporarily distracted by one of Catalina's sisters but finally married Catalina, reluctantly, under pressure from Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. However, by doing so, he hoped to secure the good will of both her family and that of Vel\u00e1zquez.<ref>Sanderson Beck, [http://www.san.beck.org/11-2-SpanishConquest.html#3 \"Cort\u00e8s in Mexico\"]</ref>\n\nIt was not until he had been almost 15 years in the Indies that Cort\u00e9s began to look beyond his substantial status as mayor of the capital of Cuba and as a man of affairs in the thriving colony. He missed the first two expeditions, under the orders of [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (discoverer of Yucat\u00e1n)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] and then [[Juan de Grijalva]], sent by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez to [[Mexico]] in 1518.\n\n== Destroying the ships ==\nThere are differing perceptions about what happened to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's ships.

At the last minute, due to the old argument between the two, Vel\u00e1zquez changed his mind and revoked Cort\u00e9s's charter.

Since Cort\u00e9s had sired children with a variety of indigenous women, including a son around 1522 by his cultural translator, [[La Malinche|Do\u00f1a Marina]], Cort\u00e9s knew he was capable of fathering children.

During the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery|Catholic Church]] had seen early attempts at conversion in the Caribbean islands by Spanish friars, particularly the mendicant orders. Cort\u00e9s made a request to the Spanish monarch to send [[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars to Mexico to convert the vast indigenous populations to Christianity. In his fourth letter to the king, Cort\u00e9s pleaded for friars rather than diocesan or secular priests because those clerics were in his view a serious danger to the Indians' conversion.\n\n<blockquote>If these people [Indians] were now to see the affairs of the Church and the service of God in the hands of canons or other dignitaries, and saw them indulge in the vices and profanities now common in Spain, knowing that such men were the ministers of God, it would bring our Faith into much harm that I believe any further preaching would be of no avail.<ref>Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, ''Letters from Mexico'', translated and edited by A.R. Pagden. New York: Grossman Publishers, 1971, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe wished the mendicants to be the main evangelists.  Mendicant friars did not usually have full priestly powers to perform all the sacraments needed for conversion of the Indians and growth of the neophytes in the Christian faith, so Cort\u00e9s laid out a solution to this to the king.\n\n<blockquote>Your Majesty should likewise beseech His Holiness [the pope] to grant these powers to the two principal persons in the religious orders that are to come here, and that they should be his delegates, one from the Order of St. Francis and the other from the Order of St. Dominic. They should bring the most extensive powers Your Majesty is able to obtain, for, because these lands are so far from the Church of Rome, and we, the Christians who now reside here and shall do so in the future, are so far from the proper remedies of our consciences and, as we are human, so subject to sin, it is essential that His Holiness should be generous with us and grant to these persons most extensive powers, to be handed down to persons actually in residence here whether it be given to the general of each order or to his provincials.<ref>Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, ''Letters from Mexico'', translated and edited by A.R. Pagden. New York: Grossman Publishers, 1971, p. 334</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Franciscans arrived in May 1524, a symbolically powerful group of twelve known as the [[Twelve Apostles of Mexico]], led by Fray [[Mart\u00edn de Valencia]].  Franciscan [[Geronimo de Mendieta]] claimed that Cort\u00e9s's most important deed was the way he met this first group of Franciscans. The conqueror himself was said to have met the friars as they approached the capital, kneeling at the feet of the friars who had walked from the coast. This story was told by Franciscans to demonstrate Cort\u00e9s piety and humility and was a powerful message to all, including the Indians, that Cort\u00e9s's earthly power was subordinate to the spiritual power of the friars. However, one of the first twelve Franciscans, Fray [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]] does not mention it in his history.<ref>John Leddy Phelan, ''The Snake Person Kingdom of the Franciscans in the New World,'' chapter 3, \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, the Moses of the New World,\" Berkeley: University of California Press, second edition, revised, 1971, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> Cort\u00e9s and the Franciscans had a particularly strong alliance in Mexico, with Franciscans seeing him as \"the new Moses\" for conquering Mexico and opening it to Christian evangelization. In Motolinia's 1555 response to Dominican [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], he praises Cort\u00e9s.\n\n<blockquote>And as to those who murmur against the Marqu\u00e9s del Valle [Cort\u00e9s], God rest him, and who try to blacken and obscure his deeds, I believe that before God their deeds are not as acceptable as those of the Marqu\u00e9s. Although as a human he was a sinner, he had faith and works of a good Christian, and a great desire to employ his life and property in widening and augmenting the fair of Jesus Christ, and dying for the conversion of these gentiles ... Who has loved and defended the Indians of this new world like Cort\u00e9s? ... Through this captain, God opened the door for us to preach his holy gospel and it was he who caused the Indians to revere the holy sacraments and respect the ministers of the church.<ref>Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, \"The Franciscan reply (to the Dominicans) in ''Letters and People of the Spanish Indies, Sixteenth Century,'' translated and edited by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and Enrique Otte.

Fearing that [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] might head an insurrection in Mexico, he brought him with him to Honduras. In a controversial move, Cuauht\u00e9moc was executed during the journey.

The Licentiate then fell ill and died shortly after his arrival, appointing [[Marcos de Aguilar]] as ''alcalde mayor''. The aged Aguilar also became sick and appointed [[Alonso de Estrada]] governor, who was confirmed in his functions by a royal decree in August 1527. Cort\u00e9s, suspected of poisoning them, refrained from taking over the government.\n\nEstrada sent Diego de Figueroa to the south. De Figueroa raided graveyards and extorted contributions, meeting his end when the ship carrying these treasures sank. Albornoz persuaded Alonso de Estrada to release [[Gonzalo de Salazar]] and Chirinos. When Cort\u00e9s complained angrily after one of his adherents' hands was cut off, Estrada ordered him exiled. Cort\u00e9s sailed for Spain in 1528 to appeal to King Charles.\n\n===First return to Spain (1528) and Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca===\n[[Image:Jakob Seisenegger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''Emperor Charles V with Hound'' (1532), a painting by the 16th-century artist [[Jakob Seisenegger]].]]\nIn 1528, Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain to appeal to the justice of his master, Charles V.

By this time Charles had returned and Cort\u00e9s forthrightly responded to his enemy's charges. Denying he had held back on gold due the crown, he showed that he had contributed more than the quinto (one-fifth) required. Indeed, he had spent lavishly to build the new capital of Mexico City on the ruins of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, leveled during the siege that brought down the Aztec empire.\n\nHe was received by Charles with every distinction, and decorated with the [[order of Santiago]].

The natives documented the abuses in the [[Huexotzinco Codex]].\n\nThe entailed estate and title passed to his legitimate son Don [[Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, 2nd Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca|Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s]] upon Cort\u00e9s's death in 1547, who became the Second Marquess. Don Mart\u00edn's association with the so-called Encomenderos' Conspiracy endangered the entailed holdings, but they were restored and remained the continuing reward for Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's family through the generations.\n\n===Return to Mexico===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\n[[Image:Hernan Fernando Cortes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, with his coat of arms on the upper left corner. 16th c. Attributed to the Master Saldana. Museo Nacional de Historia. [[Chapultepec Castle]]]]\nCort\u00e9s returned to Mexico in 1530 with new titles and honors, but with diminished power. Although Cort\u00e9s still retained military authority and permission to continue his conquests, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] was appointed in 1535 to administer New Spain's civil affairs. This division of power led to continual dissension, and caused the failure of several enterprises in which Cort\u00e9s was engaged.\n\nOn returning to Mexico, Cort\u00e9s found the country in a state of [[anarchy]]. There was a strong suspicion in court circles of an intended rebellion by Cort\u00e9s, and a charge was brought against him that cast a fatal blight upon his character and plans. He was accused of murdering his first wife. The proceedings of the investigation were kept secret.\n\nNo report, either exonerating or condemning Cort\u00e9s, was published. Had the Government declared him innocent, it would have greatly increased his popularity. Had it declared him a criminal, a crisis would have been precipitated by the accused and his party. Silence was the only safe policy, but that silence is suggestive that grave danger was feared from his influence.\n\nAfter reasserting his position and reestablishing some sort of order, Cort\u00e9s retired to his estates at [[Palace of Cort\u00e9s, Cuernavaca|Cuernavaca]], about 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) south of Mexico City. There he concentrated on the building of his palace and on Pacific exploration. Remaining in Mexico between 1530 and 1541, Cort\u00e9s quarreled with [[Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n]] and disputed the right to explore the territory that is today [[California]] with [[Antonio de Mendoza]], the first viceroy.\n\nCort\u00e9s acquired several silver mines in [[Zumpango del Rio]] in 1534.  By the early 1540s, he owned 20 silver mines in [[Sultepec]], 12 in [[Taxco]], and 3 in [[Zacualpan, State of Mexico|Zacualpan]].  Earlier, Cort\u00e9s had claimed the silver in the [[Tamazula de Gordiano|Tamazula]] area.<ref name=\"Bakewell\">{{cite book|author=West, Robert.

Cort\u00e9s also spent time exploring the Pacific coast of Mexico. The [[Gulf of California]] was originally named the ''Sea of Cort\u00e9s'' by its discoverer [[Francisco de Ulloa]] in 1539. This was the last major expedition by Cort\u00e9s.\n\n==Later life and death==\n\n===Second return to Spain===\nAfter his exploration of Baja California, Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain in 1541, hoping to confound his angry civilians, who had brought many lawsuits against him (for debts, abuse of power, etc.).<ref name=Grunberg/>\n\nOn his return he was utterly neglected, and could scarcely obtain an audience. On one occasion he forced his way through a crowd that surrounded the emperor's carriage, and mounted on the footstep.

In February 1544 he made a claim on the royal treasury, but was ignored for the next three years. Disgusted, he decided to return to Mexico in 1547. When he reached Seville, he was stricken with [[dysentery]]. He died in [[Castilleja de la Cuesta]], [[Seville]] province, on December 2, 1547, from a case of [[pleurisy]] at the age of 62.\n\nHe left his many [[mestizo]] and white children well cared for in his will, along with every one of their mothers. He requested in his will that his remains eventually be buried in Mexico. Before he died he had the Pope remove the \"natural\" status of four of his children (legitimizing them in the eyes of the church), including [[Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s (son of do\u00f1a Marina)|Martin]], the son he had with Do\u00f1a Marina (also known as La Malinche), said to be his favourite.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} His daughter, Do\u00f1a Catalina, however, died shortly after her father's death.\n[[File:Busto de Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in the [[General Archive of the Indies]] in [[Seville]]]]\nAfter his death, his body was moved more than eight times for several reasons. On December 4, 1547 he was buried in the [[mausoleum]] of the Duke of Medina in the church of San Isidoro del Campo, Sevilla. Three years later (1550) due to the space being required by the duke, his body was moved to the altar of Santa Catarina in the same church. In his testament, Cort\u00e9s asked for his body to be buried in the monastery he had ordered to be built in Coyoacan in M\u00e9xico, ten years after his death, but the monastery was never built. So in 1566, his body was sent to New Spain and buried in the church of  San Francisco de Texcoco, where his mother and one of his sisters were buried.\n[[File:Tumba de Cort\u00e9s.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Cort\u00e9s in the Hospital de Jes\u00fas Nazareno, which he founded in Mexico City.]]\nIn 1629, ''Don Pedro Cort\u00e9s fourth \"Marquez del Valle'', his last male descendant, died, so the viceroy decided to move the bones of Cort\u00e9s along with those of his descendant to the Franciscan church in M\u00e9xico. This was delayed for nine years, while his body stayed in the main room of the palace of the viceroy. Eventually it was moved to the Sagrario of  Franciscan church, where it stayed for 87 years. In 1716, it was moved to another place in the same church. In 1794, his bones were moved to the \"[[Hospital de Jes\u00fas Nazareno|Hospital de Jesus]]\" (founded by Cort\u00e9s), where a statue by [[Manuel Tols\u00e1|Tols\u00e1]] and a mausoleum were made. There was a public ceremony and all the churches in the city rang their bells.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nIn 1823, after the independence of M\u00e9xico, it seemed imminent that his body would be desecrated, so the mausoleum was removed, the statue and the coat of arms were sent to [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], to be protected by the Duke of Terranova.

(\"Cortez\", p. 60).</ref>\n\n==Disputed interpretation of his life==\n\nThere are relatively few sources to the early life of Cort\u00e9s; his fame arose from his participation in the conquest of Mexico and it was only after this that people became interested in reading and writing about him.\n\nProbably the best source is his letters to the king which he wrote during the campaign in Mexico, but they are written with the specific purpose of putting his efforts in a favourable light and so must be read critically. Another main source is the biography written by Cort\u00e9s's private chaplain [[Lopez de G\u00f3mara]], which was written in Spain several years after the conquest. G\u00f3mara never set foot in the Americas and knew only what Cort\u00e9s had told him, and he had an affinity for knightly romantic stories which he incorporated richly in the biography. The third major source is written as a reaction to what its author calls \"the lies of Gomara\", the eyewitness account written by the Conquistador [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] does not paint Cort\u00e9s as a [[romantic hero]] but rather tries to emphasize that Cort\u00e9s's men should also be remembered as important participants in the undertakings in Mexico.\n[[File:1000 pesetas, 12 de octubre de 1992, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|1000 Spanish peseta note issued in 1992]]\nIn the years following the conquest more critical accounts of the Spanish arrival in Mexico were written. The [[Dominican friar]] [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]] wrote his ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'' which raises strong accusations of brutality and heinous violence towards the Indians; accusations against both the conquistadors in general and Cort\u00e9s in particular.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/515/ |title=Mirror of the Cruel and Horrible Spanish Tyranny Perpetrated in the Netherlands, by the Tyrant, the Duke of Alba, and Other Commanders of King Philip II |work=[[World Digital Library]] |year=1620 |access-date=25 August 2013 |last=de las Casas |first=Bartolom\u00e9 |author-link=Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas |last2=Gysius |first2=Johannes |author2-link=Johannes Gysius |editor-last=Lons |editor-first=Dirck Eversen |editor2-last=Vinckeboons |editor2-first=David |editor2-link=David Vinckboons |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref> The accounts of the conquest given in the [[Florentine Codex]] by the Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] and his native informants are also less than flattering towards Cort\u00e9s.

Thus, she is a constant target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes they are going to wear for [[Halloween]], and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.\n\nAt the science fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet [[tarantula]] has escaped, and Carly Beth is terrified of tarantulas. Steve creeps up behind her during the chaos, and pinches her leg to make it seem that the tarantula is biting her. Carly Beth flies into a frenzied panic, destroys her and Sabrina's project and is again humiliated in front of her teachers and classmates. Carly Beth vows that she will definitely make Steve pay for what he did to her. She plots to go to a new store that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as payback.\n\nOn Halloween day, she goes to the party store, but it is closed. However, the store manager appears and allows her into the shop. She dismisses the masks she sees on display as not good enough for scaring anyone. But she sneaks into a back room and discovers a row of hideously deformed masks. She is startled to find that the masks feel warm and like human skin, not rubber or plastic. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after she takes the mold of her head that her mother made, she puts on the mask and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them. She starts acting more and more aggressively as the night goes on: she chokes Sabrina, throws apples at a house, and frightens children she does not know. When she manages to scare Chuck and Steve, she loses the head her mother made, but no longer cares.\n\nWhile at Sabrina's house, Carly Beth is shocked to find she is unable to remove the mask and that the mask has, in fact, become her face. She returns to the store and finds the owner waiting for her. The store owner tells her that the \"mask\" is actually a real living face. All the masks in the back room are deformed, monstrous, living faces. The store owner made them; they started out beautiful but then became hideous. Every so often, a person puts one on and the mask possesses them. It can only be removed by a \"symbol of love\", but if it attaches itself to her or another person again, it will be forever. Carly Beth screams in horror, and the other masks begin to pursue her. While running away from the masks, she realizes that the mold her mother made is a symbol of love. Carly Beth finds the mold and uses it to deter the masks and remove the mask from her face. She returns home to her mother, tossing the mask away. Noah later bursts in and asks her, \"How do I look in your mask?\"\n\n==Reception==\n''The Haunted Mask'' was featured on ''USA Today''{{'}}s Top 150 Best-Selling Books database for 43 weeks, attaining a peak position of 107.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/21/the-haunted-mask/2444877/isbn/9780439918725/ | title=The Haunted Mask | work=[[USA Today]] | accessdate=May 20, 2017}}</ref> In 2001, it was listed as the 249th bestselling children's paperback book of all time by ''Publishers Weekly'', having sold 1.42 million copies.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20011217/28595-all-time-bestselling-children-s-books.html | title=All-Time Bestselling Children's Books | work=Publishers Weekly | date=December 17, 2001 | accessdate=May 4, 2018 | author=Hochman Turvey, Debbie | editor1-last=Roback | editor1-first=Diane | editor2-last=Britton | editor2-first=Jason}}</ref>\n\nTerreece Clarke from [[Common Sense Media]] rated the book three stars out of five, commenting that it \"is ideal for reluctant readers and Halloween-themed sleepovers\" and \"is one of the better books in the ''Goosebumps'' series\".<ref name=\"commonsensemedia\"/> ''[[Flavorwire]]''{{'}}s Kevin Pires listed the book as one of his ten favorite ''Goosebumps'' books, stating \"Tim Jacobus' [...] gripping illustration and Stine's straightforward plot made ''The Haunted Mask'' an emblem for the series.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://flavorwire.com/419028/celebrate-r-l-stines-70th-birthday-with-his-10-best-goosebumps-books/view-all | title=Celebrate R.L.

L. Stine]]. The book follows Carly Beth, a girl who buys a [[Halloween]] mask from a store. After putting on the mask, she starts acting differently and discovers that the mask has become her face; she is unable to pull the mask off. R. L. Stine says he got the idea for the book from his son who had put on a Halloween mask he had trouble getting off.\n\n''The Haunted Mask'' was featured on the ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' bestseller list, and cited by one reviewer as \"ideal for reluctant readers and Halloween-themed sleepovers.\" In the mid-1990s, the book was [[The Haunted Mask (Goosebumps episode)|adapted for television]] and released on VHS on March 12, 1996. ''The Haunted Mask'' has three published sequels: ''The Haunted Mask II'', ''The Scream of the Haunted Mask'' and a stand-alone story, ''Wanted: The Haunted Mask''.\n\n==Background==\n''The Haunted Mask'' was written by R. L. Stine and originally illustrated by [[Tim Jacobus]]. The author says the idea for the book came from his son Matthew Stine, who put on a mask that he had trouble getting off during Halloween.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/13-things-you-want-know-about-rl-stine/ | title=13 Things You Want to Know About R.L.

Thus, she is a constant target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes they are going to wear for [[Halloween]], and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.\n\nAt the science fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet [[tarantula]] has escaped, and Carly Beth is terrified of tarantulas. Steve creeps up behind her during the chaos, and pinches her leg to make it seem that the tarantula is biting her. Carly Beth flies into a frenzied panic, destroys her and Sabrina's project and is again humiliated in front of her teachers and classmates. Carly Beth vows that she will definitely make Steve pay for what he did to her. She plots to go to a new store that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as payback.\n\nOn Halloween day, she goes to the party store, but it is closed. However, the store manager appears and allows her into the shop. She dismisses the masks she sees on display as not good enough for scaring anyone. But she sneaks into a back room and discovers a row of hideously deformed masks. She is startled to find that the masks feel warm and like human skin, not rubber or plastic. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after she takes the mold of her head that her mother made, she puts on the mask and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them. She starts acting more and more aggressively as the night goes on: she chokes Sabrina, throws apples at a house, and frightens children she does not know. When she manages to scare Chuck and Steve, she loses the head her mother made, but no longer cares.\n\nWhile at Sabrina's house, Carly Beth is shocked to find she is unable to remove the mask and that the mask has, in fact, become her face. She returns to the store and finds the owner waiting for her. The store owner tells her that the \"mask\" is actually a real living face. All the masks in the back room are deformed, monstrous, living faces. The store owner made them; they started out beautiful but then became hideous. Every so often, a person puts one on and the mask possesses them. It can only be removed by a \"symbol of love\", but if it attaches itself to her or another person again, it will be forever. Carly Beth screams in horror, and the other masks begin to pursue her. While running away from the masks, she realizes that the mold her mother made is a symbol of love. Carly Beth finds the mold and uses it to deter the masks and remove the mask from her face. She returns home to her mother, tossing the mask away. Noah later bursts in and asks her, \"How do I look in your mask?\"\n\n==Reception==\n''The Haunted Mask'' was featured on ''USA Today''{{'}}s Top 150 Best-Selling Books database for 43 weeks, attaining a peak position of 107.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/21/the-haunted-mask/2444877/isbn/9780439918725/ | title=The Haunted Mask | work=[[USA Today]] | accessdate=May 20, 2017}}</ref> In 2001, it was listed as the 249th bestselling children's paperback book of all time by ''Publishers Weekly'', having sold 1.42 million copies.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20011217/28595-all-time-bestselling-children-s-books.html | title=All-Time Bestselling Children's Books | work=Publishers Weekly | date=December 17, 2001 | accessdate=May 4, 2018 | author=Hochman Turvey, Debbie | editor1-last=Roback | editor1-first=Diane | editor2-last=Britton | editor2-first=Jason}}</ref>\n\nTerreece Clarke from [[Common Sense Media]] rated the book three stars out of five, commenting that it \"is ideal for reluctant readers and Halloween-themed sleepovers\" and \"is one of the better books in the ''Goosebumps'' series\".<ref name=\"commonsensemedia\"/> ''[[Flavorwire]]''{{'}}s Kevin Pires listed the book as one of his ten favorite ''Goosebumps'' books, stating \"Tim Jacobus' [...] gripping illustration and Stine's straightforward plot made ''The Haunted Mask'' an emblem for the series.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://flavorwire.com/419028/celebrate-r-l-stines-70th-birthday-with-his-10-best-goosebumps-books/view-all | title=Celebrate R.L.
