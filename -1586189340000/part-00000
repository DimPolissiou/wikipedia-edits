The name almost certainly originated with a small farmstead, the \"ham\" or farm of a man called Daecca, as ''D\u00e6ccan hamm'' in [[Old English]] means ''home of a man called D\u00e6cca''.<ref name=mills29>{{Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=64}}</ref> The charter was made to reflect a transfer of land from Aethelred, kinsman of [[Saebbi of Essex|King Saebbi of Essex]], to Barking Abbey.<ref>On the context of the charter https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol5/pp190-214</ref>\n\n===Manor of Barking===\nDagenham has been historically defined by its [[Civil Parish#Ancient parishes|Ancient Parish]] boundaries, which were subsequently re-used by the [[Municipal Borough of Dagenham]] up until 1965. The parish of Dagenham was formed in the medieval period to serve - along with parish of [[Barking, London|Barking]] (which included [[Ilford|Great Ilford]] until the 19th century)<ref>on the history of the Manor of Barking https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol5/pp190-214</ref> - the people of the huge manor of Barking, which was owned by the Nunnery of [[Barking Abbey]]. This reversed the usual situation where a parish would serve one or more manors.\nAs with other manors, the area held by the declined over time, but the parish boundaries based on its former extent remained constant. Barking Abbey was dissolved in 1539.\n\n===Pre-urban landscape===\nLike most Essex [[River Thames|Thames-side]] parishes, Dagenham was laid out on a N-S axis to give it a share of the marshes by the river, the agricultural land in the centre and the woods and commons on the poorer soils on the high ground in the north. Dagenham included a significant part of the now mostly lost [[Hainault Forest]].\n\n===Dagenham Breach===\nDagenham was protected from the Thames by defences built in the 17th century by Dutch engineers. In 1704 an exceptionally high tide swept away fourteen feet of embankment and flooded nearly 5,000 acres of land. The breach widened over time to a width of 400 feet, allowing the Thames to strip  the top layer of marsh clay from the flood plain and deposited it as a mud bank in the Thames where it became a danger to shipping.\n\nThe gap in the wall was replaced by 1714 in a celebrated act of civil engineering. The closure of the gap left behind a large lake, known as Dagenham Breach, which became a popular spot for anglers. The lake is still there, but much has silted up or been filled in, and it is now surrounded by industry.<ref>http://www.barkinghistory.co.uk/dagenham-breach.html</ref>\n\n===Whitebait Dinners===\nDagenham was formerly home to the famous annual whitebait feast. The custom appears to have been started by the King's Commissioner of Works to celebrate the closure of the breach in the seawall around 1714\u201320, and was held every subsequent spring, on or around [[Trinity Sunday]].\n\nMany years later, [[Sir Robert Preston, 6th Baronet|Sir Robert Preston MP]], invited his friend [[George Rose (politician)|George Rose]] the Secretary of the Treasury and others to celebrate the feast, and on another occasion Rose invited the Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]. Thereafter it became an obligatory ritual of government for the entire cabinet to come to Dagenham and celebrate the security of the Thames and over time this simple but hearty meal based on Whitebait and local Essex Ale grew more lavish, including turtle, grouse, champagne and a range of other luxury food and drink. Eventually the cabinet tired of the long trip to Dagenham and moved the event to [[Greenwich]].<ref>Simon Schama \u2013 Landscape and Memory p352-354</ref>\n\n===Economic development===\n[[File:Ford Dagenham.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ford Dagenham|Ford Dagenham Terminal]]]]\nIn 1931 the [[Ford of Britain|Ford Motor Company]] relocated from [[Trafford Park]] in Manchester, to a [[Ford Dagenham|plant in Dagenham]], which was already the location of supplier Briggs Motorway Bodies. A 500-acre (2&nbsp;km\u00b2) riverside site was developed to become Europe's largest car plant, a vast [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] site with its own [[blast furnace]]s and power station, importing iron ore and exporting finished vehicles. By the 1950s Ford had taken over Briggs at Dagenham and its other sites at [[Doncaster]], [[Southampton]], [[Croydon]] and [[Romford]]. At its peak the Dagenham plant had {{convert|4000000|ft2}} of floor space and employed over 40,000 people, although this number gradually fell during the final three decades of the 20th century as production methods advanced and Ford invested in other European factories as well.<ref>Ford UK \u2013 [http://www.ford.co.uk/ie/htg_fib/-/htg_fib_WW21970/-/-/-/- History of Ford in Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217091509/http://www.ford.co.uk/ie/htg_fib/-/htg_fib_WW21970/-/-/-/- |date=17 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn 20 February 2002, full production was discontinued due to overcapacity in Europe and the relative difficulty of upgrading the 60-year-old site compared with other European sites such as [[Almussafes]] ([[Valencia (province)|Valencia]], [[Spain]]) and [[Cologne]]. Other factors leading to the closure of the Auto-assembly line were the need of the site for the new Diesel Centre of Excellence, which produces half of Ford's Diesel Engines worldwide, and the UK employment laws when compared to Spanish, German and Belgian laws. In 2005 Cummins went into a joint venture and offered $15 million (US) to reinstate the factory. Ford and Cummins offered a good redundancy package, billed as one of the best in UK manufacturing.

Each ward elects three councillors to [[Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council]]. The whole area is within the [[City and East (London Assembly constituency)|City and East London Assembly Constituency]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Beam valley park.jpg|thumb|The [[River Rom|River Beam]] in the south of Dagenham]]\nDagenham is located approximately {{convert|11.5|mi|km|1}} east of [[Charing Cross]] in Central London. The [[Becontree]] estate is largely in the pre-1965 borough of Dagenham, which also  also included [[Becontree Heath]], part of [[Rush Green, London|Rush Green]], Old Dagenham village, and the southern section around [[Dagenham Dock]] and adjacent to the [[River Thames]]. This southern section, which includes [[Ford Dagenham]], is part of the [[London Riverside]] section of the [[Thames Gateway]] redevelopment zone. The Dagenham [[post town]] includes the whole of the Becontree estate, including those sections that were in the former (pre 1965) boroughs of Barking and Ilford. Parts of the former borough of Dagenham - part of Chadwell Heath, part of Collier Row and part of Rush Green - are in the Romford Post town.\n\n(Dagenham is the name of a post town, and of a pre-1965 borough (and parish before that) with very different boundaries to the post town. Perhaps because of the name 'London Borough of Barking & Dagenham', adopted on 1 January 1980 to replace 'London Borough of Barking', there is an apparent popular - but incorrect - assumption that everywhere in that borough is either in Barking or in Dagenham. From 1965 it was true to say that everywhere in the then new London Borough was in one of the two former boroughs, but in the mid 1990s substantial areas of the London Borough of Redbridge were transferred to the borough, such that the entire Becontree and Padnall Estates were in LB Barking and Dagenham. Furthermore, parts of three post towns - Barking, Dagenham and Romford - cover the borough. The parliamentary constituency of Dagenham, formed in 1945, ceased to exist from the 2010 General Election, the six easternmost wards of LB Barking & Dagenham having become part of the Dagenham & Rainham Constituency,  with three wards in LB Havering, leaving most LB Barking & Dagenham wards in the enlarged Barking constituency.)\n\n==Demography==\nDagenham is a working class area. During the 2000s [does this mean 2000-09?] there was a large influx of migrants, in particular Africans.<ref name=\"observer article industrial history\">{{cite news | author = Asthana, Anushka |author-link=Anushka Asthana| title = Dagenham's heyday: 'It was all just one big happy family then' | work = [[The Observer]] | date = 21 March 2010 | pages = 18\u201319 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/mar/21/dagenham-barking-ford-industrial-history | accessdate = 23 March 2010}}</ref> The current population of the former (pre 1965) Borough of Dagenham could be approximated from the population of the current wards which together most closely match the area, but the former boundary between the borough and neighbouring Barking, with which it merged in 1965, no longer corresponds to any ward boundaries.\n\nAt the time of the 2011 census, the Alibon ward (north of Heathway station) was 61% White British and 15% Black African.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/alibon-e05000027|title=Alibon - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|website=UK Census Data}}</ref> Goresbrook ward (southwest from Heathway) was 57% White British and 17% Black African.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/goresbrook-e05000033|title=Goresbrook - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|website=UK Census Data}}</ref> River ward (south of Heathway) was 51% White British and 19% Black African.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/river-e05000038|title=River - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|website=UK Census Data}}</ref> Village ward (east from Heathway) was 58% White British and 19% Black African.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/village-e05000041|title=Village - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|website=UK Census Data}}</ref> Eastbrook ward (around Eastbrookend Country) was 69% White British and 11% Black African.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/eastbrook-e05000030|title=Eastbrook - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|website=UK Census Data}}</ref> Heath ward (north of Heathway) was 60% White British and 17% Black African.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/heath-e05000034|title=Heath - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|website=UK Census Data}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nDagenham is connected to the [[London Underground]] services from three stations, [[Becontree tube station|Becontree]] (in the pre-1965 borough of Barking), [[Dagenham East tube station|Dagenham East]] and [[Dagenham Heathway tube station|Dagenham Heathway]], all on the [[District line]].

Nine successive members of the Fanshawe family served as [[Remembrancer]] to the Crown, following Henry Fanshawe's appointment to the position by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1566. The appointment made possible the family's rise to prominence.\n\nIn the post town of Romford and the pre-1965 borough of Dagenham, on the corner of Whalebone Lane and the Eastern Avenue, diagonally opposite the [[Moby-Dick]] public house, is the site of Marks Manor House, a large 15th-century moated building demolished in the early 19th century. During [[World War II]] the adjoining fields were used by the [[Royal Artillery]] for an anti-aircraft battery; later a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] for Germans was erected there.

They were the Nationwide Conference champions in the 2006/07 season.\n\nMotorcycle speedway was staged at the greyhound stadium in Ripple Road in the mid to late 1930s. The club run events focussed on training but a team called the Dagenham Daggers did take part in local competitions. It is possible that the venture was operational as early as 1931 a meeting at Caxton (Cambridgeshire) was advertised as Caxton Speedway v Dagenham Speedway.\n\nDagenham's leading cricket club [[Goresbrook Cricket Club]] are based at the May & Baker Sports Club in Rainham Road South, in 2011 the club won the Essex County Cricket League for the first time in its history.\n\nDagenham has a [[List of King George V Playing Fields (Greater London)|King George's Field]] in memorial to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. The park, which has been in existence for over a century [give date], was renamed in 1953 by [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. Dagenham also has many other parks such as Valence - and Parsloes (which lies partly in the pre-1965 borough of Barking).

The name almost certainly originated with a small farmstead, the \"ham\" or farm of a man called Daecca, as ''D\u00e6ccan hamm'' in [[Old English]] means ''home of a man called D\u00e6cca''.<ref name=mills29>{{Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=64}}</ref> The charter was made to reflect a transfer of land from Aethelred, kinsman of [[Saebbi of Essex|King Saebbi of Essex]], to Barking Abbey.<ref>On the context of the charter https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol5/pp190-214</ref>\n\n===Manor of Barking===\nDagenham has been historically defined by its [[Civil Parish#Ancient parishes|Ancient Parish]] boundaries, which were subsequently re-used by the [[Municipal Borough of Dagenham]] up until 1965. The parish of Dagenham was formed in the medieval period to serve - along with parish of [[Barking, London|Barking]] (which included [[Ilford|Great Ilford]] until the 19th century)<ref>on the history of the Manor of Barking https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol5/pp190-214</ref> - the people of the huge manor of Barking, which was owned by the Nunnery of [[Barking Abbey]]. This reversed the usual situation where a parish would serve one or more manors.\nAs with other manors, the area held by the declined over time, but the parish boundaries based on its former extent remained constant. Barking Abbey was dissolved in 1539.\n\n===Pre-urban landscape===\nLike most Essex [[River Thames|Thames-side]] parishes, Dagenham was laid out on a N-S axis to give it a share of the marshes by the river, the agricultural land in the centre and the woods and commons on the poorer soils on the high ground in the north. Dagenham included a significant part of the now mostly lost [[Hainault Forest]].\n\n===Dagenham Breach===\nDagenham was protected from the Thames by defences built in the 17th century by Dutch engineers. In 1704 an exceptionally high tide swept away fourteen feet of embankment and flooded nearly 5,000 acres of land. The breach widened over time to a width of 400 feet, allowing the Thames to strip  the top layer of marsh clay from the flood plain and deposited it as a mud bank in the Thames where it became a danger to shipping.\n\nThe gap in the wall was replaced by 1714 in a celebrated act of civil engineering. The closure of the gap left behind a large lake, known as Dagenham Breach, which became a popular spot for anglers. The lake is still there, but much has silted up or been filled in, and it is now surrounded by industry.<ref>http://www.barkinghistory.co.uk/dagenham-breach.html</ref>\n\n===Whitebait Dinners===\nDagenham was formerly home to the famous annual whitebait feast. The custom appears to have been started by the King's Commissioner of Works to celebrate the closure of the breach in the seawall around 1714\u201320, and was held every subsequent spring, on or around [[Trinity Sunday]].\n\nMany years later, [[Sir Robert Preston, 6th Baronet|Sir Robert Preston MP]], invited his friend [[George Rose (politician)|George Rose]] the Secretary of the Treasury and others to celebrate the feast, and on another occasion Rose invited the Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]. Thereafter it became an obligatory ritual of government for the entire cabinet to come to Dagenham and celebrate the security of the Thames and over time this simple but hearty meal based on Whitebait and local Essex Ale grew more lavish, including turtle, grouse, champagne and a range of other luxury food and drink.

A 500-acre (2&nbsp;km\u00b2) riverside site was developed to become Europe's largest car plant, a vast [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] site with its own [[blast furnace]]s and power station, importing iron ore and exporting finished vehicles. By the 1950s Ford had taken over Briggs at Dagenham and its other sites at [[Doncaster]], [[Southampton]], [[Croydon]] and [[Romford]]. At its peak the Dagenham plant had {{convert|4000000|ft2}} of floor space and employed over 40,000 people, although this number gradually fell during the final three decades of the 20th century as production methods advanced and Ford invested in other European factories as well.<ref>Ford UK \u2013 [http://www.ford.co.uk/ie/htg_fib/-/htg_fib_WW21970/-/-/-/- History of Ford in Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217091509/http://www.ford.co.uk/ie/htg_fib/-/htg_fib_WW21970/-/-/-/- |date=17 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn 20 February 2002, full production was discontinued due to overcapacity in Europe and the relative difficulty of upgrading the 60-year-old site compared with other European sites such as [[Almussafes]] ([[Valencia (province)|Valencia]], [[Spain]]) and [[Cologne]]. Other factors leading to the closure of the Auto-assembly line were the need of the site for the new Diesel Centre of Excellence, which produces half of Ford's Diesel Engines worldwide, and the UK employment laws when compared to Spanish, German and Belgian laws. In 2005 Cummins went into a joint venture and offered $15 million (US) to reinstate the factory. Ford and Cummins offered a good redundancy package, billed as one of the best in UK manufacturing.

The [[Becontree]] estate is largely in the pre-1965 borough of Dagenham, which also  also included [[Becontree Heath]], part of [[Rush Green, London|Rush Green]], Old Dagenham village, and the southern section around [[Dagenham Dock]] and adjacent to the [[River Thames]]. This southern section, which includes [[Ford Dagenham]], is part of the [[London Riverside]] section of the [[Thames Gateway]] redevelopment zone. The Dagenham [[post town]] includes the whole of the Becontree estate, including those sections that were in the former (pre 1965) boroughs of Barking and Ilford. Parts of the former borough of Dagenham - part of Chadwell Heath, part of Collier Row and part of Rush Green - are in the Romford Post town.\n\n(Dagenham is the name of a post town, and of a pre-1965 borough (and parish before that) with very different boundaries to the post town. Perhaps because of the name 'London Borough of Barking & Dagenham', adopted on 1 January 1980 to replace 'London Borough of Barking', there is an apparent popular - but incorrect - assumption that everywhere in that borough is either in Barking or in Dagenham. From 1965 it was true to say that everywhere in the then new London Borough was in one of the two former boroughs, but in the mid 1990s substantial areas of the London Borough of Redbridge were transferred to the borough, such that the entire Becontree and Padnall Estates were in LB Barking and Dagenham. Furthermore, parts of three post towns - Barking, Dagenham and Romford - cover the borough. The parliamentary constituency of Dagenham, formed in 1945, ceased to exist from the 2010 General Election, the six easternmost wards of LB Barking & Dagenham having become part of the Dagenham & Rainham Constituency,  with three wards in LB Havering, leaving most LB Barking & Dagenham wards in the enlarged Barking constituency.)\n\n==Demography==\nDagenham is a working class area.

He has made state visits to Bhutan and Nepal and Japan within the first 100 days of his government followed by visits of Myanmar and Australia and also hosted Asia leaders like Australian Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] and Vietnamese Prime Minister [[Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng]] apart from inviting [[SAARC]] leaders in his inauguration ceremony.

The region plays a vital role in India's economy as it supplies nearly two third of India's total oil import, bilateral trade is also flourishing in recent years particularly with UAE and other Gulf states. Over the years millions of Indians mostly working class have migrated to the gulf looking for jobs and they account for a sizeable share in the total remittances received from abroad.\n\n===Link West policy===\nIn an attempt to strengthen ties with India's western neighbors specially the [[Persian gulf|gulf countries]], Modi proposed this policy to complement his [[Act East policy]] concerning East Asia.

It was held as part of an agreement between CONMEBOL (the South American football confederation) and [[CONCACAF]] (the football confederation for North and Central America and the Caribbean) as a special edition between the usual four-year cycle, and featured an expanded field of 16 teams (an increase from the usual 12), with all ten teams from CONMEBOL and six teams from CONCACAF.

anthem of Chile]] was played for Uruguay. Many Uruguayan players seemed confused. The [[National Anthem of Uruguay|correct anthem]] was never played. Copa Am\u00e9rica organizers released the following statement via [[Twitter]]:<blockquote>This evening during the pre-match ceremony, due to human error, we inadvertently played the incorrect National Anthem [sic]. We sincerely apologize to the Uruguayan Federation, the Uruguay National Team, the people of Uruguay and to the fans for this mistake. We will work with all parties involved to ensure such an error this does not occur again.</blockquote>\n\nUruguayan midfielder [[Diego Fag\u00fandez]] said the incident showed \"much disrespect\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/06/05/copa-america-uruguay-mexico-wrong-national-anthem-video|title=Copa America plays wrong anthem for Uruguay|first=SI|last=Wire}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 June, Colombian nationals heavily criticized Adidas for misspelling the country name in an advertisement, substituting \"Columbia\" for \"Colombia\".

Brazilian goalkeeper [[Alisson Becker|Alisson]] dropped the ball, and it went over the line into his own goal. The replays seemed to show the ball was not completely out of bounds before being crossed, but the goal did not stand. The match ended in a 0\u20130 draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavy.com/sports/2016/06/brazil-vs-ecuador-copa-america-score-results-highlights-2016-who-won-match/|title=Who Won the Brazil vs. Ecuador Match in Copa America?|first=Jonathan|last=Adams|date=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 June, during the game between Chile and Bolivia, a penalty kick was awarded to Chile after [[Luis Alberto Guti\u00e9rrez]] was whistled for a handball. The assistant referee made the call, but it appeared that Guti\u00e9rrez had tucked his arm behind his back, and the ball hit off his shoulder. [[Arturo Vidal]] converted the ensuing penalty at the 90'+10' mark (eight minutes of stoppage time were added to the second half due to an injury to [[Ronald Eguino]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screengrabber.deadspin.com/ronald-eguino-knocked-out-by-kick-to-the-head-returns-1781795767|title=Ronald Eguino Knocked Out By Kick To The Head, Returns Moments Later|first=Timothy|last=Burke}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/report?gameId=444712|title=Chile vs. Bolivia - Football Match Report - June 10, 2016 - ESPN|website=ESPNFC.com|access-date=2016-06-16}}</ref> to secure the three points for Chile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/06/10/chile-bolivia-copa-america-live-score-gamecast|title=Chile beats Bolivia on controversial penalty kick|first=SI|last=Staff}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 June, during the game between Peru and Brazil, [[Ra\u00fal Ruid\u00edaz]] scored by guiding the ball into the net with his arm. After a lengthy discussion between the referee and his assistant, the goal was allowed to stand, and Brazil went on to lose 1\u20130, resulting in their elimination from the tournament.
