It is an ''audava'' r\u0101gam (or ''owdava'' r\u0101ga, meaning pentatonic scale). It is a ''[[janya]]'' r\u0101ga (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven ''[[swara]]s'' (musical notes). ''Gambhiranata'' is also known as ''Shuddha Nata''.<ref name=\"raganidhi\">''Raganidhi'' by P.

Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH Publications</ref> in Carnatic music classification \u2013 ''audava'' meaning 'of 5'). Its ascending and descending scale structure (''{{IAST|\u0101roha\u1e47a-avaroha\u1e47a}}'') is as follows:\n\n*[[Arohana|{{IAST|\u0101roha\u1e47a}}]] : {{svaraC|S|G3|M1|P|N3|S'|foot=yes}}\n*[[Avarohana|{{IAST|avaroha\u1e47a}}]] : {{svaraC|S'|N3|P|M1|G3|S|foot=yes}}\n\nThe notes used in this scale are ''shadjam, antara gandharam, shuddha madhyamam, panchamam'' and ''kakali nishadam'' (see [[Swara#Swaras in Carnatic music|''swaras'' in Carnatic music]] for details on below notation and terms). ''Gambhiranata'' is considered a ''janya'' r\u0101gam of ''[[Chalanata]]'', the 36th ''[[Melakarta]]'' r\u0101gam, though it can be derived from 8 other melakarta r\u0101gams, by dropping both ''rishabham'' and ''dhaivatam''.\n\n==Popular Compositions==\n''Gambhiranata'' r\u0101gam lends itself for elaboration due to the pentatonic nature and symmetricity of the scale. The ''[[mallari]]'' tune played in ''[[Nadhaswaram]]'' at temple processions are set to this musical scale.<ref name=\"ragas\" /> Here are some compositions set to this scale.\n\n*''Sri jalandharam'' composed by [[Jayachamaraja Wodeyar Bahadur|Jayachamaraja Wodeyar]]\n*''Jayadevaki kishora'' by [[Swati Tirunal]]\n*''Sharanambe vani'' by [[Purandaradasa]]\n*''Ini aedu kavalai'' by [[Periyasaamy Thooran]]\n*'' Varnam - Amma Anandadayini'' by [[M.

It is an ''audava'' r\u0101gam (or ''owdava'' r\u0101ga, meaning pentatonic scale). It is a ''[[janya]]'' r\u0101ga (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven ''[[swara]]s'' (musical notes). ''Gambhiranata'' is also known as ''Shuddha Nata''.<ref name=\"raganidhi\">''Raganidhi'' by P. Subba Rao, Pub. 1964, The Music Academy of Madras</ref>\n\n==Structure and Lakshana==\n[[Image:Gambhiranata scale.svg|thumb|right|300px|''Gambhiranata'' scale with ''shadjam'' at C]]\n\n''Gambhiranata'' is a symmetric r\u0101ga that does not contain ''rishabham'' or ''dhaivatam''. It is a pentatonic scale (''audava-audava'' ragam<ref name=\"raganidhi\" /><ref name=\"ragas\">''Ragas in Carnatic music'' by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH Publications</ref> in Carnatic music classification \u2013 ''audava'' meaning 'of 5'). Its ascending and descending scale structure (''{{IAST|\u0101roha\u1e47a-avaroha\u1e47a}}'') is as follows:\n\n*[[Arohana|{{IAST|\u0101roha\u1e47a}}]] : {{svaraC|S|G3|M1|P|N3|S'|foot=yes}}\n*[[Avarohana|{{IAST|avaroha\u1e47a}}]] : {{svaraC|S'|N3|P|M1|G3|S|foot=yes}}\n\nThe notes used in this scale are ''shadjam, antara gandharam, shuddha madhyamam, panchamam'' and ''kakali nishadam'' (see [[Swara#Swaras in Carnatic music|''swaras'' in Carnatic music]] for details on below notation and terms). ''Gambhiranata'' is considered a ''janya'' r\u0101gam of ''[[Chalanata]]'', the 36th ''[[Melakarta]]'' r\u0101gam, though it can be derived from 8 other melakarta r\u0101gams, by dropping both ''rishabham'' and ''dhaivatam''.\n\n==Popular Compositions==\n''Gambhiranata'' r\u0101gam lends itself for elaboration due to the pentatonic nature and symmetricity of the scale. The ''[[mallari]]'' tune played in ''[[Nadhaswaram]]'' at temple processions are set to this musical scale.<ref name=\"ragas\" /> Here are some compositions set to this scale.\n\n*''Sri jalandharam'' composed by [[Jayachamaraja Wodeyar Bahadur|Jayachamaraja Wodeyar]]\n*''Jayadevaki kishora'' by [[Swati Tirunal]]\n*''Sharanambe vani'' by [[Purandaradasa]]\n*''Ini aedu kavalai'' by [[Periyasaamy Thooran]]\n*'' Varnam - Amma Anandadayini'' by [[M.

These councils hold their elections on the same timetable, and were due to hold an election in 2020 but not in 2021. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the May 2020 elections were postponed to May 2021. The remaining three metropolitan boroughs elect their councillors in full every four years. [[Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council]] was due to hold an election for all councillors in May 2020, but this was postponed to 2021. [[Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council]] was due to elect their councillors in 2021. [[Birmingham City Council]] holds its elections on a four-year cycle from 2018, so is not due to hold an election until 2022.\n\nDue to boundary changes, [[Salford City Council]] is also to elect all of its councillors in 2021, before returning to the thirds schedule.

As indicated below, magnitude is measured on the [[Richter magnitude scale]] (''M<sub>L</sub>'') or the [[moment magnitude scale]] (''M<sub>w</sub>''), or the [[surface-wave magnitude| surface wave magnitude scale]] (''M<sub>s</sub>'') for very old earthquakes. The present list is not exhaustive, and reliable and precise magnitude data is scarce for earthquakes that occurred prior to the development of modern measuring instruments.\n\n==Geological Background ==\n[[File:Japan separation.png|thumb|270px|left|The islands comprising the [[Japanese Archipelago]] were separated from mainland Asia by [[back-arc spreading]]]]\n\nThe islands of Japan are primarily the result of several large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-[[Silurian]] to the [[Pleistocene]] as a result of the [[subduction]] of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] beneath the continental [[Amurian Plate]] and [[Okinawa Plate]] to the south, and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]] under the [[Okhotsk Plate]] to the north.\n\nJapan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the [[Eurasia]]n continent. The subducting plates, being deeper than the Eurasian plate, pulled Japan eastward, opening the [[Sea of Japan]] around 15 million years ago.<ref name=\"Barnes\">{{cite web|url=http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1501.pdf|author=Barnes, Gina L.|title=Origins of the Japanese Islands: The New \"Big Picture\"|publisher=[[University of Durham]]|date=2003|accessdate=August 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428043510/http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1501.pdf|archive-date=April 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The [[Strait of Tartary]] and the [[Korea Strait]] opened much later. Today the Japanese archipelago is considered a mature island arc and is the result of several generations of subducting plates. Approximately 15,000&nbsp;km of oceanic floor has passed under the Japanese area in the last 450 million years, with most being fully subducted.<ref name=\"Barnes\"/>\n\nJapan is situated in a [[Volcano|volcanic]] zone on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].<ref name=\"Barnes\"/> Frequent low intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in [[tsunami]]s, occur several times a century. Most of the earthquakes following that occurred in Japan happened because of a destructive plate boundary. This is when continental and oceanic plates collide and the heavier, more dense oceanic plate \u2018sinks\u2019 underneath the continental one.{{clear left}}\n\n==History==\nAlthough there is mention of an earthquake in [[Yamato province|Yamato]]<!--Yarnato? printing unclear--> in what is now [[Nara Prefecture]] on August 23, 416, the first to be reliably documented took place in Nara prefecture on May 28, 599 during the reign of [[Empress Suiko]], destroying buildings throughout [[Yamato province]].<ref>Hammer, Joshua.

Earthquakes measured at ''shindo'' four and lower are considered to be weak to mild, while those measured at five and above can cause heavy damage to [[furniture]], wall [[tile]]s, [[wood]]en houses, [[reinforced concrete]] buildings, [[roads]], [[gas pipe|gas]] and [[water pipe]]s.<ref name=\"Guide\"/>\n\n==Earthquakes==\n{{Expand list|date=May 2015}}\n<!--When editing, add earthquakes in chronological order (oldest at the top, to make it easier to find duplicates)-->\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" id=\"stripe\"\n!Date\n![[Seismic scale#Magnitude scales|Magnitude]]\n!Death toll\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Name&nbsp;of&nbsp;quake\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Japanese&nbsp;name\n!class=\"unsortable\"|R\u014dmaji&nbsp;name\n![[Epicenter]]\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Description\n<!--\n|-\n| {{dts|YYYY|MM|DD}} || Magnitude || Name || Japanese || ''Romaji'' || Epicenter || Deaths || Description\n-->\n|-\n| {{dts|684|11|29}} ([[Gregorian calendar]])<br>{{dts|684|11|26}} ([[Julian calendar]]) || 8.4 ''M<sub>K</sub>'' (Kawasumi scale)<ref>Kawasumi, H., 1951, Measures of earthquakes danger and expectancy of maximum intensity throughout Japan as inferred from the seismic activity in historical times, ''Bull.

In the fire that broke out subsequently, half of Toyooka was burned down, with many deaths resulting (a reported 8% of the town's population.) 272 deaths were confirmed to have occurred in the Kinosaki area.\n|-\n| {{dts|1927|03|07}} || 7.6 ''M<sub>L</sub>'' ||{{Hs|003020}}3,020 ||[[1927 Kita Tango earthquake]] || \u5317\u4e39\u5f8c\u5730\u9707 || ''Kita Tango Jishin'' || [[Tango Peninsula]] in [[Kyoto Prefecture]] || Almost all of the houses in Mineyama (now part of [[Ky\u014dtango, Kyoto|Ky\u014dtango]]) were destroyed, and the quake was felt as far away as [[Tokyo]] and [[Kagoshima]].<ref name=\"kitatango-usgs\">{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/events/1927_03_07.php|title=Historic Earthquakes: Tango, Japan, 1927 March 07 09:27 UTC, Magnitude 7.6|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2009-05-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509130409/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/events/1927_03_07.php|archive-date=2009-05-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n| {{dts|1930|11|26}} || 7.3 ''M<sub>s</sub>'' ||{{Hs|000272}}272 ||[[1930 North Izu earthquake]] || 1930\u5e74\u5317\u4f0a\u8c46\u5730\u9707 || ''Sen-ky\u016bhyaku-sanj\u016b-nen Kita-Izu Jishin'' || [[Izu Peninsula]] || \n|-\n| {{dts|1933|03|02}} || 8.4 ''M<sub>w</sub>''<ref>Kanamori, H.

The subducting plates, being deeper than the Eurasian plate, pulled Japan eastward, opening the [[Sea of Japan]] around 15 million years ago.<ref name=\"Barnes\">{{cite web|url=http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1501.pdf|author=Barnes, Gina L.|title=Origins of the Japanese Islands: The New \"Big Picture\"|publisher=[[University of Durham]]|date=2003|accessdate=August 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428043510/http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1501.pdf|archive-date=April 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The [[Strait of Tartary]] and the [[Korea Strait]] opened much later. Today the Japanese archipelago is considered a mature island arc and is the result of several generations of subducting plates. Approximately 15,000&nbsp;km of oceanic floor has passed under the Japanese area in the last 450 million years, with most being fully subducted.<ref name=\"Barnes\"/>\n\nJapan is situated in a [[Volcano|volcanic]] zone on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].<ref name=\"Barnes\"/> Frequent low intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in [[tsunami]]s, occur several times a century. Most of the earthquakes following that occurred in Japan happened because of a destructive plate boundary. This is when continental and oceanic plates collide and the heavier, more dense oceanic plate \u2018sinks\u2019 underneath the continental one.{{clear left}}\n\n==History==\nAlthough there is mention of an earthquake in [[Yamato province|Yamato]]<!--Yarnato? printing unclear--> in what is now [[Nara Prefecture]] on August 23, 416, the first to be reliably documented took place in Nara prefecture on May 28, 599 during the reign of [[Empress Suiko]], destroying buildings throughout [[Yamato province]].<ref>Hammer, Joshua.

According to the Japanese government's official report, there were 428 human fatalities, 1,016 people injured, 7,863 buildings destroyed, and 45,659 houses damaged by collapse or fire. This quake caused extensive damage to the town of Toyooka and the Maruyama River area. Just before the shaking could be felt, a sound like a cannon was reportedly heard intermittently from the direction of the estuary near the Maruyama River. During the earthquake, the ground in the town of Tokyooka experienced strong seismic vibrations for 16 seconds. As most of the buildings of the time were wooden, many of them were destroyed at once during the initial earthquake. In the fire that broke out subsequently, half of Toyooka was burned down, with many deaths resulting (a reported 8% of the town's population.) 272 deaths were confirmed to have occurred in the Kinosaki area.\n|-\n| {{dts|1927|03|07}} || 7.6 ''M<sub>L</sub>'' ||{{Hs|003020}}3,020 ||[[1927 Kita Tango earthquake]] || \u5317\u4e39\u5f8c\u5730\u9707 || ''Kita Tango Jishin'' || [[Tango Peninsula]] in [[Kyoto Prefecture]] || Almost all of the houses in Mineyama (now part of [[Ky\u014dtango, Kyoto|Ky\u014dtango]]) were destroyed, and the quake was felt as far away as [[Tokyo]] and [[Kagoshima]].<ref name=\"kitatango-usgs\">{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/events/1927_03_07.php|title=Historic Earthquakes: Tango, Japan, 1927 March 07 09:27 UTC, Magnitude 7.6|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2009-05-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509130409/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/events/1927_03_07.php|archive-date=2009-05-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n| {{dts|1930|11|26}} || 7.3 ''M<sub>s</sub>'' ||{{Hs|000272}}272 ||[[1930 North Izu earthquake]] || 1930\u5e74\u5317\u4f0a\u8c46\u5730\u9707 || ''Sen-ky\u016bhyaku-sanj\u016b-nen Kita-Izu Jishin'' || [[Izu Peninsula]] || \n|-\n| {{dts|1933|03|02}} || 8.4 ''M<sub>w</sub>''<ref>Kanamori, H.

In subsequent centuries, the Turco-Persian culture would be carried on further by the conquering peoples to neighbouring regions, eventually becoming the predominant culture of the ruling and elite classes of South Asia ([[Indian Subcontinent]]), specifically North India ([[Mughal Empire]]),  [[Central Asia]] and [[Tarim basin]] ([[Northwest China]]) and large parts of West Asia ([[Middle East]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Canfield|first=Robert L.|title=Turko-Persia in Historical Perspective|year=1991|page=1 (\"Origins\")|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=[[Cambridge]], United Kingdom<!--|isbn=0-521-39094-X-->|isbn=0-521-52291-9}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nTurkic-Persian tradition was a variant of [[Islamic culture]].<ref name=\"Hodgson\" /> It was [[Islam]]ic in that Islamic notions of virtue, permanence, and excellence infused discourse about public issues as well as the religious affairs of the [[Muslim]]s, who were the presiding elite.<ref name=\"Canfield\"/>\n  \nAfter the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], [[Middle Persian]], the language of [[Sassanids]], continued in wide use well into the second [[Islamic calendar|Islamic century]] (eighth century) as a medium of administration in the eastern lands of the [[Caliphate]].<ref name=\"Canfield\"/> Despite [[Arabization]] of public affairs, the peoples retained much of their pre-Islamic outlook and way of life, adjusted to fit the demands of the Islamic religion. \n\nTowards the end of the first Islamic century, the population began resenting the cost of sustaining the Arab [[Caliph]]s, the [[Umayyads]]--who had become oppressive and corrupt. In the second Islamic century (eighth century AD), a generally Persian-led uprising, led by the Iranian national hero [[Abu Muslim|Abu Muslim Khorasani]], brought another Arab clan, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], to the Caliphal throne. Under the Abbasids, the [[Persianate]] customs of their [[Barmakids|Barmakid]] [[vizier]]s became the style of the ruling elite. \n\nPolitically, the Abbasids soon started losing their control, causing two major lasting consequences. First, the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutasim (833-842) greatly increased the presence of [[Kimek Khanate|Turkic mercenaries]] and [[Mamluk]] slaves in the Caliphate, and they eventually displaced Arabs and Persians from the military, and therefore from the political hegemony, starting an era of Turco-Persian symbiosis.<ref>[[Bernard Lewis]], \"The Middle East\", 1995, p. 87</ref> \n\nSecond, the governors in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], [[Tahirids]], were factually independent; then the [[Saffarids]] from [[Sistan]] freed the eastern lands, but were replaced by independent [[Samanids]], although they showed perfunctory deference to the Caliph.<ref name=\"Canfield\" /> Separation of the eastern lands from Caliphate was expressed in a distinctive Persianate culture that became a dominant culture in [[West Asia|West]], [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]], and the source of innovations elsewhere in the Islamic world. \n\nThis culture would persist, at least in the modified form of the [[Ottoman Empire]], into the twentieth century. The Persianate culture was marked by the use of the new [[Persian language]] as a medium of administration and literature, by the rise of Persianized Turks to military control, by new political importance of non-Arab [[ulama]], and by development of ethnically composite Islamic society.\n\n=== Language ===\nMiddle Persian was a [[lingua franca]] of the region before the Arab invasion, but afterwards Arabic became a preferred medium of literary expression. Instrumental in the spread of the Persian language as a common language along the [[Silk Road]] between [[China]] and [[Parthia]] in the second century BCE, that lasted well into the sixteenth century, were many [[Bukharian Jews]] who flocked to [[Bukhara]] in the [[Central Asia]] and as a merchant class played a great role in the operation of the Silk Road.{{citation needed|reason=A pretty bold claim without any source |date=August 2016}} \n\nIn the ninth century emerged a new Persian language as the idiom of administration and literature. Tahirids and Saffarids continued using Persian as an informal language, although for them Arabic was the \"only proper language for recording anything worthwhile, from poetry to science\",<ref>[[Richard Nelson Frye|Frye, R.N.]] 1975. The Golden Age of Persia: The Arabs in the East. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, and New York: Barnes and Noble, 1921</ref> but the [[Samanids]] made Persian a language of learning and formal discourse. The language that appeared in the ninth and tenth centuries was a new form of Persian, based on the Middle Persian of pre-Islamic times, but enriched by ample Arabic vocabulary and written in Arabic script. \n\nThe Samanids began recording their court affairs in Arabic and in this language, and they used it as the main public idiom. The earliest great poetry in New Persian was written for the Samanid court. Samanids encouraged translation of religious works from Arabic into Persian. Even the learned authorities of Islam, the [[ulama]], began using the Persian lingua franca in public, although they still used Arabic as a medium of scholarship. The crowning literary achievement in the early New Persian language, the [[Shahnameh|Book of Kings]] of [[Ferdowsi]], presented to the court of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (998-1030), was more than a literary achievement; it was a kind of [[Persian people|Iranian]] nationalistic memoir, Ferdowsi galvanized Persian nationalistic sentiments by invoking pre-Islamic Persian heroic imagery. Ferdowsi enshrined in literary form the most treasured stories of popular folk-memory.<ref name=\"Canfield\" />\n[[File:\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f \u063a\u0632\u0646\u0648\u06cc.JPG|thumb|right|340px|Image of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in his court where noblemen and noblewomen convened.]]\nBefore the [[Ghaznavids]] broke away, the Samanid rulership was internally falling to its Turkic servants. The Samanids had their own guard of Turkic [[Mamluk]] mercenaries (the [[ghilman]]), who were headed by a chamberlain, and a Persian and Arabic speaking bureaucracy, headed by a Persian [[vizier]]. The army was largely composed of mostly Turkic Mamluks. By the latter part of the tenth century, Samanid rulers gave the command of their army to Turkic generals. \n\nThese generals eventually had effective control over all Samanid affairs. The rise of Turks in Samanid times brought a loss of Samanid southern territories to one of their Mamluks, who were governing on their behalf. [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] ruled over southeastern extremities of Samanid territories from the city of [[Ghazni]]. Turkic political ascendancy in the Samanid period in the tenth and eleventh centuries resulted in the fall of Samanid ruling institution to its Turkic generals; and in a rise of Turkic pastoralists in the countryside. \n\nThe [[Ghaznavids]] (989-1149) founded empire which became a most powerful in the east since Abbasid Caliphs at their peak, and their capital at Ghazni became second only to [[Baghdad]] in cultural elegance. It attracted many scholars and artists of the Islamic world. Turkic ascendance to power in the Samanid court brought Turks as the main patrons of Persianate culture, and as they subjugated Western and Southern Asia, they brought along this culture.\n\nThe [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] (999-1140) at that time were gaining pre-eminence over the countryside. The Kara-Khanids were pastoralists of noble Turkic backgrounds, and they cherished their Turkic ways. As they gained strength they fostered development of a new Turkish literature alongside the Persian and Arabic literatures that had arisen earlier.\n\n==Historical outline==\n\n===Beginning of the Turco-Persian symbiosis===\nIn Samanid times began the growth of the public influence of the [[ulama]], the learned scholars of Islam. ''Ulama'' grew in prominence as the Samanids gave special support to [[Sunnism]], in contrast with their [[Shiite]] neighbors, the [[Buyids]]. They enjoyed strong position in the city of [[Bukhara]], and it grew under the Samanids' successors Kara-Khanid Khanate. [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Kara-Khanids]] established a dominance of ''ulama'' in the cities, and the network of recognized Islamic authorities became an alternative social instrument for the maintenance of public order. In the Kara-Khanid Khanate formed an ethnically and dogmatically diverse society. The eastern lands of the Caliphate were ethnically and religiously very diverse. [[Christians]], [[Jews]], and [[Zoroastrians]] were numerous, and also several minority Islamic sects had considerable following. These diverse peoples found refuge in the cities. Bukhara and [[Samarkand]] swelled and formed ethnic and sectarian neighborhoods, most of them surrounded by walls, each with its own markets, [[caravansaraies]], and public squares. The religious authorities of these non-Muslim communities became their spokesmen, just as the ''ulama'' were for the Muslim community, they also began overseeing internal communal affairs. Thus, alongside the rise of the ''ulama'', there was a corresponding rise in the political importance of the religious leaders of other doctrinal communities.<ref name=\"Canfield\" />\n\nThe ruling institution was dominated by Turks from various tribes, some highly urbanized and Persianized, some rural and still very Turkic. It was managed by bureaucrats and ''ulama'' who used both Persian and Arabic, its literati participated in both the Arabic and Persian traditions of high culture of the wider Islamicate world. This composite culture was the beginning of the Turko-Persian variant of Islamicate culture. As \"[[Persianate]]\" it was centred on a lettered tradition of Persian origin, it was Turkic because for many generations it was patronized by rulers of Turkic ancestry, and it was \"Islamicate\" because the Islamic notions of virtue, permanence, and excellence channeled the discourse about public issues and religious affairs of the Muslims, who were a presiding elite.<ref name=\"Hodgson\">[[Marshall Hodgson|Hodgson, Marshall G. S.]] 1974. The Venture of Islam. 3 vols. Chicago: University of Chicago Press</ref> The combination of these elements in the Islamic society had a strong impact on the religion, because Islam was disengaged from its Arabic background and [[Bedouin]] traditions and became a far richer, more adaptable, and universal culture.<ref>[[Richard Nelson Frye|Frye, R.N.]] 1965.

Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, vii</ref> The appearance of New Persian, ascendancy of Turks to power in place of the Persian Samanids, rise of the non-Arabic ''ulama'' in the cities, and development of ethnically and confessionally complex urban society marked an emergence of a new Turco-Persian Islamic culture. As the Turco-Persian Islamic culture was exported into the wider region of Western and Southern Asia, the transformation became increasingly evident.\n\nThe early stages of Turco-Persian cultural synthesis in the Islamic world are marked by cultural, social and political tensions and competition among Turks, Persians, and Arabs, despite the egalitarianism of Islamic doctrine.

These two dynasties together drew the center of the Islamic world eastward. The institutions stabilized Islamic society into a form that would persist, at least in [[Western Asia]], until the twentieth century.<ref name=\"Canfield\" />\n\nThe Turco-Persian distinctive Islamic culture flourished for hundreds of years, and then faded under imposed modern [[Europe]]an influences.{{citation needed|reason=another bold claim without a source; also language is kind of biased|date=August 2016}} Turco-Persian Islamic culture is a mix of [[Arabic culture|Arabic]], [[Persian culture|Persian]], and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] elements blended in the ninth and tenth centuries into what eventually became a predominant culture of the ruling and elite classes of [[West Asia|West]], [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]].<ref name=\"Canfield\"/>\n\nThe Ghaznavids moved their capital from [[Ghazni]] to [[Lahore]], which they turned into another center of [[Islamic culture]]. Under Ghaznavids poets and scholars from [[Kashgar]], [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Baghdad]], [[Nishapur]], and [[Ghazni]] congregated in Lahore. Thus, the Turco-Persian culture was brought deep into India<ref name=\"Ikram\">[[S. M. Ikram|Ikram]], S. M. 1964. Muslim Civilization in India. New York: Columbia University Press</ref> and carried further in the thirteenth century.\n\nThe [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] successors of Kara-Khanid Khanate in [[Transoxiana]] brought this culture westward into Persia, Iraq, and Syria. Seljuqs won a decisive battle with the Ghaznavids and then swept into [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], they brought Turco-Persian Islamic culture westward into western Persia and Iraq. Persia and Central Asia became a heartland of Persianate language and culture. As Seljuks came to dominate Iraq, Syria, and Anatolia, they carried this Turco-Persian culture beyond, and made it the culture of their courts in the region to as far west as the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the [[Sultanate of Rum]] in Anatolia, while taking their thoroughly Persianised identity with them, giving it an even more profound and noted history there.<ref>Sigfried J. de Laet.

The great jurist and theologian [[al-Ghazali]] proposed a synthesis of [[Sufism]] and [[sharia]] that became a basis of a richer Islamic theology. Formulating the Sunni concept of division between temporal and religious authorities, he provided a theological basis for the existence of [[Sultanate]], a temporal office alongside the Caliphate, which by that time was merely a religious office. The main institutional means of establishing a consensus of the ''ulama'' on these dogmatic issues were the [[madrasas]], formal Islamic schools that granted licensure to teach. First established under Seljuqs, these schools became means of uniting Sunni ''ulama'' which legitimized the rule of the Sultans. The bureaucracies were staffed by graduates of the madrasas, so both the ''ulama'' and the bureaucracies were under the influence of esteemed professors at the madrasas.<ref name=\"Canfield\" /><ref>[[Richard Nelson Frye|Frye, R.N.]] 1975. The Golden Age of Persia: The Arabs in the East.

A shared culture spread from [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] to the mouth of [[Ganges]], despite political fragmentation and ethnic diversity.<ref name=\"Canfield\" />\n\n===Through the centuries===\n\nThe culture of the Turco-Persian world in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries was tested by invading armies of inland Asia. The [[Mongols]] under [[Genghis Khan]] (1220\u201358) and [[Timur]] (''Tamerlane'', 1336-1405) had the effect of stimulating development of Persianate culture of Central and West Asia, because of the new concentrations of specialists of high culture created by the invasions, for many people had to seek refuge in few safe havens, primarily India, where scholars, poets, musicians, and fine artisans intermingled and cross-fertilized, and because the broad peace secured by the huge imperial systems established by the [[Ilkhanate|Il-Khans]] (in the thirteenth century) and [[Timurids]] (in the fifteenth century), when travel was safe, and scholars and artists, ideas and skills, and fine books and artifacts circulated freely over a wide area. Il-Khans and Timurids deliberately patronized Persianate high culture. Under their rule developed new styles of architecture, Persian literature was encouraged, and flourished miniature painting and book production, and under Timurids prospered Turkic poetry, based on the vernacular known as [[Chagatai language|Chaghatai]] (today called [[uzbek language|Uzbek]]; of Turkic [[Karluks|Qarluq]] origin).\n\nIn that period the Turco-Persian culture of India prospered. Mamluk guards, mostly [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and Mongols, along with Persians (now known as ''[[T\u0101jik people|Tajiks]]''), [[Khalji]]s and [[Pashtuns|Afghans]], dominated India from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, ruling as Sultans in [[Delhi]]. Their society was enriched by influx of Islamic scholars, historians, architects, musicians, and other specialists of high Persianate culture that fled the Mongol devastations of Transoxiana and Khurasan. After the sack of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258, Delhi became the most important cultural center of the Muslim east.<ref name=\"Ikram\" /> The Delhi Sultans modeled their life-styles after the Turkic and Persian upper classes, who now predominated in most of Western and Central Asia. They patronized literature and music, but became especially notable for their architecture, because their builders drew from Muslim world architecture to produce a profusion of [[mosques]], palaces, and tombs unmatched in any other Islamic country.<ref name=\"Ikram\" />\n\nIn Mongol and Timurid times the predominant influences on Turco-Persian culture were imposed from Central Asia, and in this period Turco-Persian culture became sharply distinguishable from the Arabic Islamic world to the west, the dividing zone fell along [[Euphrates]]. Socially, the Turco-Persian world was marked by a system of ethnologically defined elite statuses: the rulers and their soldiery were Turkic or [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] Mongols; the administrative cadres and literati were Persian. Cultural affairs were marked by characteristic pattern of language use: New Persian was the language of state affairs and literature; New Persian and Arabic the languages of scholarship; Arabic the language of adjudication; and Turkic the language of the military.<ref name=\"Ikram\" />\n\nIn the sixteenth century arose the Turko-Persian empires of the [[Ottomans]] in [[Asia Minor]] and South Eastern Europe, [[Safavids]] in Persia, and [[Mughals]] in India. Thus, from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries the territories from South Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, [[Asia Minor]] to East [[Bengal]] were dominated by Turco-Persian dynasties.\n\nAt the beginning of the fourteenth century the Ottomans rose to predominance in Asia Minor, and developed an empire that subjugated most of the Arab Islamic world as well as south-eastern Europe. The Ottomans patronized Persian literature for five and a half centuries and, because Asia Minor was more stable than eastern territories, they attracted great numbers of writers and artists, especially in the sixteenth century.<ref>[[Ehsan Yarshater|Yarshater, Ehsan]]. 1988.

The [[Taj Mahal]] was commissioned by the Mughal emperor [[Shah Jahan]]. The Mughals dominated India from 1526 until the eighteenth century, when Muslim successor states and non-Muslim powers of [[Sikh]], [[Maratha]], and [[British India|British]] replaced them.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Safavid]], and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] empires developed variations of a broadly similar Turco-Persian tradition. A remarkable similarity in culture, particularly among the elite classes, spread across territories of Western, Central and South Asia. Although populations across this vast region had conflicting allegiances (sectarian, locality, tribal, and ethnic affiliation) and spoke many different languages (mostly [[Indo-Iranian languages]] like [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pushtu]], [[Balochi language|Baluchi]], or [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], or [[Turkic languages]] like [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Azeri]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[uzbeks|Uzbek]], or [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]]), people shared a number of common institutions, arts, knowledge, customs, and rituals. These cultural similarities were perpetuated by poets, artists, architects, artisans, jurists, and scholars, who maintained relations among their peers in the far-flung cities of the Turco-Persian world, from [[Istanbul]] to [[Delhi]].<ref name=\"Hodgson\" />\n\nAs the broad cultural region remained politically divided, the sharp antagonisms between empires stimulated appearance of variations of Turco-Persian culture. The main reason for this was Safavids\u2019 introduction of Shiism into Persia, done to distinguish themselves from their Sunni neighbors, especially Ottomans. After 1500, the Persian culture developed distinct features of its own, and interposition of strong [[Shiite]] culture hampered exchanges with Sunni peoples on Persia's western and eastern frontiers. The [[Sunni]] peoples of eastern Mediterranean in Asia Minor, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Sunnis of Central Asia and India developed somewhat independently. Ottoman Turkey grew more like its Arab Muslim neighbors in West Asia; India developed a South Asian style of Indo-Persian<ref>S.

In India, the Mughal Empire decayed into warring states. Only Ottoman Turkey survived into the twentieth century. The European powers encroached into the Turco-Persian region, contributing to the political fragmentation of the region. By the nineteenth century, the European secular concepts of social obligation and authority, along with superior technology, shook many established institutions of Turco-Persia.<ref name=\"Canfield\" />\n\nBy identifying the cultural regions of Asia as the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]], [[Russia|Russian Asia]], and [[East Asia]], the [[European ethnic groups|European]]s in effect dismembered the Turco-Persian Islamic world that had culturally united a vast expanse of Asia for nearly a thousand years.<ref>[[Roy Mottahedeh|Mottahedeh]], Roy., 1985.

But in informal relations the social life remained unaltered. Also, popular customs and notions of virtue, sublimity, and permanence, ideas that were entailed in Islamic religious teaching, persisted relatively unchanged.\n\n===Present===\nThe twentieth century saw many changes in inland Asia that further exposed contradictory cultural trends in the region. Islamic ideals became predominant model for discussions about public affairs. The new [[rhetoric]] of public ideals captured interest of peoples throughout Islamic world, including the area where in public affairs Turco-Persian culture once was prominent. The Islamic moral imagery that survived in informal relations emerged as the model of ideology expressed in its most political form in the [[Islamic revolution of Iran]] and in the Islamic idealism of the Afghanistan [[mujahedin]] resistance movement.<ref name=\"EoI\">Roger M.

In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna. [...] By the time of the great Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century, Iranian Islam had become not only an important component; it had become a dominant element in Islam itself, and for several centuries the main centers of the Islamic power and civilization were in countries that were, if not Iranian, at least marked by Iranian civilization. [...] The center of the Islamic world was under Turkish and Persian states, both shaped by Iranian culture. [...] The major centers of Islam in the late medieval and early modern periods, the centers of both political and cultural power, such as India, Central Asia, Iran, Turkey, were all part of this Iranian civilization. Although much of it spoke various forms of Turkish, as well as other local languages, their classical and cultural language was Persian.

The original diverse traditions were consistently shaped to conform to specific norms embedded in the Islamic law. One notable exception in the Turco-Persian tradition was the attitude to the women. The original attitude of respect to the mothers, and protection of the sisters and daughters overcame the tenets imposed by the new religion, and survived as an inherent component of the learned new society. The idea of slaughtering mothers and daughters, incessantly proclaimed from the pulpits, remained a call for action, but not the action in the majority sphere of the Turco-Persian tradition. While the best of the Turco-Persian literature is venerated and admired, the respect for the women and the old traditions of equality generally survived to the present times, except for the areas where the Arab Islamic tradition managed to entirely replace the original native traditions. The early Turkish Muslims accepted and embraced the pre-Islamic traditions and combined them with their own in a form of [[Sufi]] mysticism. Less prominent were the strict Islamic law ([[Sharia]]) and concept of waging violent external [[jihad]] against nonbelievers. Instead, as Islam was diffused into the Turkic world through Persian Sufi influences, it sought to establish a commonality of belief with the indigenous religious practices. Despite a myriad of attempts to curb it, [[Sufism]] has survived in the Turkic zone as an underlying institution of revival and alternative thinking throughout the centuries.<ref>M.

In the second Islamic century (eighth century AD), a generally Persian-led uprising, led by the Iranian national hero [[Abu Muslim|Abu Muslim Khorasani]], brought another Arab clan, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], to the Caliphal throne. Under the Abbasids, the [[Persianate]] customs of their [[Barmakids|Barmakid]] [[vizier]]s became the style of the ruling elite. \n\nPolitically, the Abbasids soon started losing their control, causing two major lasting consequences. First, the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutasim (833-842) greatly increased the presence of [[Kimek Khanate|Turkic mercenaries]] and [[Mamluk]] slaves in the Caliphate, and they eventually displaced Arabs and Persians from the military, and therefore from the political hegemony, starting an era of Turco-Persian symbiosis.<ref>[[Bernard Lewis]], \"The Middle East\", 1995, p. 87</ref> \n\nSecond, the governors in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], [[Tahirids]], were factually independent; then the [[Saffarids]] from [[Sistan]] freed the eastern lands, but were replaced by independent [[Samanids]], although they showed perfunctory deference to the Caliph.<ref name=\"Canfield\" /> Separation of the eastern lands from Caliphate was expressed in a distinctive Persianate culture that became a dominant culture in [[West Asia|West]], [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]], and the source of innovations elsewhere in the Islamic world. \n\nThis culture would persist, at least in the modified form of the [[Ottoman Empire]], into the twentieth century. The Persianate culture was marked by the use of the new [[Persian language]] as a medium of administration and literature, by the rise of Persianized Turks to military control, by new political importance of non-Arab [[ulama]], and by development of ethnically composite Islamic society.\n\n=== Language ===\nMiddle Persian was a [[lingua franca]] of the region before the Arab invasion, but afterwards Arabic became a preferred medium of literary expression. Instrumental in the spread of the Persian language as a common language along the [[Silk Road]] between [[China]] and [[Parthia]] in the second century BCE, that lasted well into the sixteenth century, were many [[Bukharian Jews]] who flocked to [[Bukhara]] in the [[Central Asia]] and as a merchant class played a great role in the operation of the Silk Road.{{citation needed|reason=A pretty bold claim without any source |date=August 2016}} \n\nIn the ninth century emerged a new Persian language as the idiom of administration and literature. Tahirids and Saffarids continued using Persian as an informal language, although for them Arabic was the \"only proper language for recording anything worthwhile, from poetry to science\",<ref>[[Richard Nelson Frye|Frye, R.N.]] 1975. The Golden Age of Persia: The Arabs in the East. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, and New York: Barnes and Noble, 1921</ref> but the [[Samanids]] made Persian a language of learning and formal discourse. The language that appeared in the ninth and tenth centuries was a new form of Persian, based on the Middle Persian of pre-Islamic times, but enriched by ample Arabic vocabulary and written in Arabic script. \n\nThe Samanids began recording their court affairs in Arabic and in this language, and they used it as the main public idiom. The earliest great poetry in New Persian was written for the Samanid court. Samanids encouraged translation of religious works from Arabic into Persian. Even the learned authorities of Islam, the [[ulama]], began using the Persian lingua franca in public, although they still used Arabic as a medium of scholarship. The crowning literary achievement in the early New Persian language, the [[Shahnameh|Book of Kings]] of [[Ferdowsi]], presented to the court of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (998-1030), was more than a literary achievement; it was a kind of [[Persian people|Iranian]] nationalistic memoir, Ferdowsi galvanized Persian nationalistic sentiments by invoking pre-Islamic Persian heroic imagery. Ferdowsi enshrined in literary form the most treasured stories of popular folk-memory.<ref name=\"Canfield\" />\n[[File:\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f \u063a\u0632\u0646\u0648\u06cc.JPG|thumb|right|340px|Image of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in his court where noblemen and noblewomen convened.]]\nBefore the [[Ghaznavids]] broke away, the Samanid rulership was internally falling to its Turkic servants. The Samanids had their own guard of Turkic [[Mamluk]] mercenaries (the [[ghilman]]), who were headed by a chamberlain, and a Persian and Arabic speaking bureaucracy, headed by a Persian [[vizier]]. The army was largely composed of mostly Turkic Mamluks. By the latter part of the tenth century, Samanid rulers gave the command of their army to Turkic generals. \n\nThese generals eventually had effective control over all Samanid affairs. The rise of Turks in Samanid times brought a loss of Samanid southern territories to one of their Mamluks, who were governing on their behalf. [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] ruled over southeastern extremities of Samanid territories from the city of [[Ghazni]]. Turkic political ascendancy in the Samanid period in the tenth and eleventh centuries resulted in the fall of Samanid ruling institution to its Turkic generals; and in a rise of Turkic pastoralists in the countryside. \n\nThe [[Ghaznavids]] (989-1149) founded empire which became a most powerful in the east since Abbasid Caliphs at their peak, and their capital at Ghazni became second only to [[Baghdad]] in cultural elegance. It attracted many scholars and artists of the Islamic world. Turkic ascendance to power in the Samanid court brought Turks as the main patrons of Persianate culture, and as they subjugated Western and Southern Asia, they brought along this culture.\n\nThe [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] (999-1140) at that time were gaining pre-eminence over the countryside. The Kara-Khanids were pastoralists of noble Turkic backgrounds, and they cherished their Turkic ways. As they gained strength they fostered development of a new Turkish literature alongside the Persian and Arabic literatures that had arisen earlier.\n\n==Historical outline==\n\n===Beginning of the Turco-Persian symbiosis===\nIn Samanid times began the growth of the public influence of the [[ulama]], the learned scholars of Islam. ''Ulama'' grew in prominence as the Samanids gave special support to [[Sunnism]], in contrast with their [[Shiite]] neighbors, the [[Buyids]]. They enjoyed strong position in the city of [[Bukhara]], and it grew under the Samanids' successors Kara-Khanid Khanate. [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Kara-Khanids]] established a dominance of ''ulama'' in the cities, and the network of recognized Islamic authorities became an alternative social instrument for the maintenance of public order. In the Kara-Khanid Khanate formed an ethnically and dogmatically diverse society. The eastern lands of the Caliphate were ethnically and religiously very diverse. [[Christians]], [[Jews]], and [[Zoroastrians]] were numerous, and also several minority Islamic sects had considerable following. These diverse peoples found refuge in the cities. Bukhara and [[Samarkand]] swelled and formed ethnic and sectarian neighborhoods, most of them surrounded by walls, each with its own markets, [[caravansaraies]], and public squares. The religious authorities of these non-Muslim communities became their spokesmen, just as the ''ulama'' were for the Muslim community, they also began overseeing internal communal affairs. Thus, alongside the rise of the ''ulama'', there was a corresponding rise in the political importance of the religious leaders of other doctrinal communities.<ref name=\"Canfield\" />\n\nThe ruling institution was dominated by Turks from various tribes, some highly urbanized and Persianized, some rural and still very Turkic. It was managed by bureaucrats and ''ulama'' who used both Persian and Arabic, its literati participated in both the Arabic and Persian traditions of high culture of the wider Islamicate world. This composite culture was the beginning of the Turko-Persian variant of Islamicate culture. As \"[[Persianate]]\" it was centred on a lettered tradition of Persian origin, it was Turkic because for many generations it was patronized by rulers of Turkic ancestry, and it was \"Islamicate\" because the Islamic notions of virtue, permanence, and excellence channeled the discourse about public issues and religious affairs of the Muslims, who were a presiding elite.<ref name=\"Hodgson\">[[Marshall Hodgson|Hodgson, Marshall G. S.]] 1974. The Venture of Islam. 3 vols. Chicago: University of Chicago Press</ref> The combination of these elements in the Islamic society had a strong impact on the religion, because Islam was disengaged from its Arabic background and [[Bedouin]] traditions and became a far richer, more adaptable, and universal culture.<ref>[[Richard Nelson Frye|Frye, R.N.]] 1965. Bukhara, the Medieval Achievement. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, vii</ref> The appearance of New Persian, ascendancy of Turks to power in place of the Persian Samanids, rise of the non-Arabic ''ulama'' in the cities, and development of ethnically and confessionally complex urban society marked an emergence of a new Turco-Persian Islamic culture. As the Turco-Persian Islamic culture was exported into the wider region of Western and Southern Asia, the transformation became increasingly evident.\n\nThe early stages of Turco-Persian cultural synthesis in the Islamic world are marked by cultural, social and political tensions and competition among Turks, Persians, and Arabs, despite the egalitarianism of Islamic doctrine.

These two dynasties together drew the center of the Islamic world eastward. The institutions stabilized Islamic society into a form that would persist, at least in [[Western Asia]], until the twentieth century.<ref name=\"Canfield\" />\n\nThe Turco-Persian distinctive Islamic culture flourished for hundreds of years, and then faded under imposed modern [[Europe]]an influences.{{citation needed|reason=another bold claim without a source; also language is kind of biased|date=August 2016}} Turco-Persian Islamic culture is a mix of [[Arabic culture|Arabic]], [[Persian culture|Persian]], and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] elements blended in the ninth and tenth centuries into what eventually became a predominant culture of the ruling and elite classes of [[West Asia|West]], [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]].<ref name=\"Canfield\"/>\n\nThe Ghaznavids moved their capital from [[Ghazni]] to [[Lahore]], which they turned into another center of [[Islamic culture]]. Under Ghaznavids poets and scholars from [[Kashgar]], [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Baghdad]], [[Nishapur]], and [[Ghazni]] congregated in Lahore. Thus, the Turco-Persian culture was brought deep into India<ref name=\"Ikram\">[[S. M. Ikram|Ikram]], S. M. 1964. Muslim Civilization in India. New York: Columbia University Press</ref> and carried further in the thirteenth century.\n\nThe [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] successors of Kara-Khanid Khanate in [[Transoxiana]] brought this culture westward into Persia, Iraq, and Syria. Seljuqs won a decisive battle with the Ghaznavids and then swept into [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], they brought Turco-Persian Islamic culture westward into western Persia and Iraq. Persia and Central Asia became a heartland of Persianate language and culture. As Seljuks came to dominate Iraq, Syria, and Anatolia, they carried this Turco-Persian culture beyond, and made it the culture of their courts in the region to as far west as the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the [[Sultanate of Rum]] in Anatolia, while taking their thoroughly Persianised identity with them, giving it an even more profound and noted history there.<ref>Sigfried J. de Laet.

The great jurist and theologian [[al-Ghazali]] proposed a synthesis of [[Sufism]] and [[sharia]] that became a basis of a richer Islamic theology. Formulating the Sunni concept of division between temporal and religious authorities, he provided a theological basis for the existence of [[Sultanate]], a temporal office alongside the Caliphate, which by that time was merely a religious office. The main institutional means of establishing a consensus of the ''ulama'' on these dogmatic issues were the [[madrasas]], formal Islamic schools that granted licensure to teach. First established under Seljuqs, these schools became means of uniting Sunni ''ulama'' which legitimized the rule of the Sultans. The bureaucracies were staffed by graduates of the madrasas, so both the ''ulama'' and the bureaucracies were under the influence of esteemed professors at the madrasas.<ref name=\"Canfield\" /><ref>[[Richard Nelson Frye|Frye, R.N.]] 1975. The Golden Age of Persia: The Arabs in the East.

A shared culture spread from [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] to the mouth of [[Ganges]], despite political fragmentation and ethnic diversity.<ref name=\"Canfield\" />\n\n===Through the centuries===\n\nThe culture of the Turco-Persian world in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries was tested by invading armies of inland Asia. The [[Mongols]] under [[Genghis Khan]] (1220\u201358) and [[Timur]] (''Tamerlane'', 1336-1405) had the effect of stimulating development of Persianate culture of Central and West Asia, because of the new concentrations of specialists of high culture created by the invasions, for many people had to seek refuge in few safe havens, primarily India, where scholars, poets, musicians, and fine artisans intermingled and cross-fertilized, and because the broad peace secured by the huge imperial systems established by the [[Ilkhanate|Il-Khans]] (in the thirteenth century) and [[Timurids]] (in the fifteenth century), when travel was safe, and scholars and artists, ideas and skills, and fine books and artifacts circulated freely over a wide area. Il-Khans and Timurids deliberately patronized Persianate high culture. Under their rule developed new styles of architecture, Persian literature was encouraged, and flourished miniature painting and book production, and under Timurids prospered Turkic poetry, based on the vernacular known as [[Chagatai language|Chaghatai]] (today called [[uzbek language|Uzbek]]; of Turkic [[Karluks|Qarluq]] origin).\n\nIn that period the Turco-Persian culture of India prospered. Mamluk guards, mostly [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and Mongols, along with Persians (now known as ''[[T\u0101jik people|Tajiks]]''), [[Khalji]]s and [[Pashtuns|Afghans]], dominated India from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, ruling as Sultans in [[Delhi]]. Their society was enriched by influx of Islamic scholars, historians, architects, musicians, and other specialists of high Persianate culture that fled the Mongol devastations of Transoxiana and Khurasan. After the sack of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258, Delhi became the most important cultural center of the Muslim east.<ref name=\"Ikram\" /> The Delhi Sultans modeled their life-styles after the Turkic and Persian upper classes, who now predominated in most of Western and Central Asia. They patronized literature and music, but became especially notable for their architecture, because their builders drew from Muslim world architecture to produce a profusion of [[mosques]], palaces, and tombs unmatched in any other Islamic country.<ref name=\"Ikram\" />\n\nIn Mongol and Timurid times the predominant influences on Turco-Persian culture were imposed from Central Asia, and in this period Turco-Persian culture became sharply distinguishable from the Arabic Islamic world to the west, the dividing zone fell along [[Euphrates]]. Socially, the Turco-Persian world was marked by a system of ethnologically defined elite statuses: the rulers and their soldiery were Turkic or [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] Mongols; the administrative cadres and literati were Persian. Cultural affairs were marked by characteristic pattern of language use: New Persian was the language of state affairs and literature; New Persian and Arabic the languages of scholarship; Arabic the language of adjudication; and Turkic the language of the military.<ref name=\"Ikram\" />\n\nIn the sixteenth century arose the Turko-Persian empires of the [[Ottomans]] in [[Asia Minor]] and South Eastern Europe, [[Safavids]] in Persia, and [[Mughals]] in India. Thus, from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries the territories from South Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, [[Asia Minor]] to East [[Bengal]] were dominated by Turco-Persian dynasties.\n\nAt the beginning of the fourteenth century the Ottomans rose to predominance in Asia Minor, and developed an empire that subjugated most of the Arab Islamic world as well as south-eastern Europe. The Ottomans patronized Persian literature for five and a half centuries and, because Asia Minor was more stable than eastern territories, they attracted great numbers of writers and artists, especially in the sixteenth century.<ref>[[Ehsan Yarshater|Yarshater, Ehsan]]. 1988.

The [[Taj Mahal]] was commissioned by the Mughal emperor [[Shah Jahan]]. The Mughals dominated India from 1526 until the eighteenth century, when Muslim successor states and non-Muslim powers of [[Sikh]], [[Maratha]], and [[British India|British]] replaced them.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Safavid]], and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] empires developed variations of a broadly similar Turco-Persian tradition. A remarkable similarity in culture, particularly among the elite classes, spread across territories of Western, Central and South Asia. Although populations across this vast region had conflicting allegiances (sectarian, locality, tribal, and ethnic affiliation) and spoke many different languages (mostly [[Indo-Iranian languages]] like [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pushtu]], [[Balochi language|Baluchi]], or [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], or [[Turkic languages]] like [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Azeri]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[uzbeks|Uzbek]], or [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]]), people shared a number of common institutions, arts, knowledge, customs, and rituals. These cultural similarities were perpetuated by poets, artists, architects, artisans, jurists, and scholars, who maintained relations among their peers in the far-flung cities of the Turco-Persian world, from [[Istanbul]] to [[Delhi]].<ref name=\"Hodgson\" />\n\nAs the broad cultural region remained politically divided, the sharp antagonisms between empires stimulated appearance of variations of Turco-Persian culture. The main reason for this was Safavids\u2019 introduction of Shiism into Persia, done to distinguish themselves from their Sunni neighbors, especially Ottomans. After 1500, the Persian culture developed distinct features of its own, and interposition of strong [[Shiite]] culture hampered exchanges with Sunni peoples on Persia's western and eastern frontiers. The [[Sunni]] peoples of eastern Mediterranean in Asia Minor, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Sunnis of Central Asia and India developed somewhat independently. Ottoman Turkey grew more like its Arab Muslim neighbors in West Asia; India developed a South Asian style of Indo-Persian<ref>S.

In India, the Mughal Empire decayed into warring states. Only Ottoman Turkey survived into the twentieth century. The European powers encroached into the Turco-Persian region, contributing to the political fragmentation of the region. By the nineteenth century, the European secular concepts of social obligation and authority, along with superior technology, shook many established institutions of Turco-Persia.<ref name=\"Canfield\" />\n\nBy identifying the cultural regions of Asia as the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]], [[Russia|Russian Asia]], and [[East Asia]], the [[European ethnic groups|European]]s in effect dismembered the Turco-Persian Islamic world that had culturally united a vast expanse of Asia for nearly a thousand years.<ref>[[Roy Mottahedeh|Mottahedeh]], Roy., 1985.

But in informal relations the social life remained unaltered. Also, popular customs and notions of virtue, sublimity, and permanence, ideas that were entailed in Islamic religious teaching, persisted relatively unchanged.\n\n===Present===\nThe twentieth century saw many changes in inland Asia that further exposed contradictory cultural trends in the region. Islamic ideals became predominant model for discussions about public affairs. The new [[rhetoric]] of public ideals captured interest of peoples throughout Islamic world, including the area where in public affairs Turco-Persian culture once was prominent. The Islamic moral imagery that survived in informal relations emerged as the model of ideology expressed in its most political form in the [[Islamic revolution of Iran]] and in the Islamic idealism of the Afghanistan [[mujahedin]] resistance movement.<ref name=\"EoI\">Roger M.

In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna. [...] By the time of the great Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century, Iranian Islam had become not only an important component; it had become a dominant element in Islam itself, and for several centuries the main centers of the Islamic power and civilization were in countries that were, if not Iranian, at least marked by Iranian civilization. [...] The center of the Islamic world was under Turkish and Persian states, both shaped by Iranian culture. [...] The major centers of Islam in the late medieval and early modern periods, the centers of both political and cultural power, such as India, Central Asia, Iran, Turkey, were all part of this Iranian civilization. Although much of it spoke various forms of Turkish, as well as other local languages, their classical and cultural language was Persian. Arabic was of course the language of scripture and law, but Persian was the language of poetry and literature\"''.<br><br>-- [[Bernard Lewis]]<ref>[http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html Iran in History by B. Lewis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429144545/http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html |date=2007-04-29 }}</ref>}}\n\nWith the firm guidance of '[[ulema]]', the diverse native traditions were transformed to a uniform mold that crossed borders and customs. The original diverse traditions were consistently shaped to conform to specific norms embedded in the Islamic law. One notable exception in the Turco-Persian tradition was the attitude to the women. The original attitude of respect to the mothers, and protection of the sisters and daughters overcame the tenets imposed by the new religion, and survived as an inherent component of the learned new society. The idea of slaughtering mothers and daughters, incessantly proclaimed from the pulpits, remained a call for action, but not the action in the majority sphere of the Turco-Persian tradition. While the best of the Turco-Persian literature is venerated and admired, the respect for the women and the old traditions of equality generally survived to the present times, except for the areas where the Arab Islamic tradition managed to entirely replace the original native traditions. The early Turkish Muslims accepted and embraced the pre-Islamic traditions and combined them with their own in a form of [[Sufi]] mysticism. Less prominent were the strict Islamic law ([[Sharia]]) and concept of waging violent external [[jihad]] against nonbelievers. Instead, as Islam was diffused into the Turkic world through Persian Sufi influences, it sought to establish a commonality of belief with the indigenous religious practices. Despite a myriad of attempts to curb it, [[Sufism]] has survived in the Turkic zone as an underlying institution of revival and alternative thinking throughout the centuries.<ref>M.
