Following the [[91st Academy Awards]] (where ''Roma'' became the first film distributed by a streaming service to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] and two other awards), a spokesperson for Spielberg's studio [[Amblin Partners]] stated that he \"feels strongly about the difference between the streaming and theatrical situation\", and would address the issue at the Academy's next board of governors meeting in April 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/movies/oscar-nominations-academy-awards.html |title='Roma' and 'The Favourite' Lead Oscar Nominations With 10 Each, writes Brooks Barnes|date=January 22, 2019|website=www.nytimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=January 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/roma-wins-oscar-best-foreign-language-film-1202045939/ |title='Roma' Wins the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, First Mexican Film to Do So |first=David |last=Ehrlich |date=February 24, 2019 |accessdate=February 24, 2019 |publisher=[[IndieWire]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/steven-spielberg-academy-netflix-oscar-competition-1203153872/|title=Spielberg to Voice Concerns Over Netflix Oscar Competition at Academy Meeting|last=Nyren|first=Erin|date=March 2, 2019|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nCritics argued that ''Roma'' had an unfair advantage, singling out the service's wide availability, refusal to report box office numbers, disrespect of the industry's standard [[release window]]s with only three weeks of exclusive theatrical play (although it is not uncommon for some nominees to only receive the week-long minimum run), and excessive marketing spend (with reports ranging between $25 and $50 million, although its Oscars marketing was rolled into Netflix's overall marketing budget).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/steven-spielberg-vs-netflix-oscar-academy-wars-1202047846/|title=The Spielberg vs. Netflix Battle Could Mean Collateral Damage for Indies at the Oscars|last=Thompson|first=Anne|last2=Thompson|first2=Anne|date=March 1, 2019|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> Due to its contravention of the standard three-month windows used by all major distributors, national cinema chains have refused to carry Netflix's theatrical releases.

These units were tested on the [[Piccadilly line]] and remained in service after production trains were introduced. Later they were transferred to the [[Northern line]], but in 1995 they were replaced as non-standard by [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 Stock]] cascaded from the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]].\n\n==Background==\nThe introduction of the [[London Underground 1938 Stock|1938 Stock]] released considerable numbers of Standard Stock trains, which were scheduled to make up the shortfall on the Central line resulting from the extensions to the line. However, this process was interrupted by the [[Second World War]], and although much of the Standard Stock had been through Acton Works for refurbishment, it was stored, as the opening of the extensions was delayed. Further refurbishment was carried out as the extensions opened between 1946 and 1949, but the stock proved to be unreliable after such a long period of storage. With the Piccadilly line also needing more trains, a plan for new rolling stock was formulated in 1948.{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |p=88}}\n\nThe plans were for 100 trains, each of seven cars. The British Transport Commission approved the project \"in principle\" in 1950, and a design contract was awarded to [[Metro-Cammell]]. A mock-up of a car body was constructed at Acton Works, and included some features which had been tried out on individual cars of 1938 stock, including some circular windows, and others that ran up above the roof line, to give passengers better visibility at stations. It was originally called 1951 Stock and then 1952 Stock when the programme was delayed. Bodywork would be of aluminium, rather than steel, but the official drawings showed that they would still be painted red, although experiments with unpainted aluminium [[London Underground R Stock|R Stock]] were taking place on the [[District line]] at the time. The high cost of building the trains, and a decline in passenger numbers, resulted in the plans being shelved in September 1952.{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |p=90}} When the situation was re-assessed in 1954, [[London Underground]] decided to build three seven-car trains incorporating new ideas, and these became the 1956 Stock. They became available in 1957, and a production run followed in 1959. The unpainted exterior was adopted for the prototype 1956 stock and production [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959]] / [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 stock]]{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |pp=92-93}} and the interiors were given a blue and grey colour scheme to match.\n\n==Design==\nThree seven-car trains of 1956 stock were built, each train by a different manufacturer. The companies involved were [[Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company|Birmingham RC&W]], [[Gloucester Railway Carriage & Wagon Company|Gloucester RC&W]] and [[Metro-Cammell]], although the units supplied were of near-identical external appearance, and fitted with the same equipment. Each company provided a three-car and a four-car unit, the three-car unit consisting of a trailer car with a driving motor car at both ends, and the four-car units being of similar formation, but with an additional non-driving motor car in the rake.<ref name=bruce87>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=87}}</ref>\n\nWhile they were similar in many respects to the [[London Underground 1938 Stock|1938 stock]], the main differences were that the body panels were unpainted aluminium, rather than painted steel, a rubber suspension system was used on the bogies, reducing the number of parts that required regular maintenance, and the lighting was provided by fluorescent tubes, rather than incandescent bulbs. The front ends were flatter above the roof line, as the destination blind was fitted over the front cab door, rather than below the cab window. Control was provided by a PCM (Pneumatic Cam Motor) controller, supplied by [[Associated Electrical Industries]], which had proved to be reliable in the 1938 stock.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\nThe outer ends of the trains were not fitted with fully automatic couplers, so that in an emergency, two trains could be coupled together mechanically, but not electrically. Once the 1959 stock was delivered, the couplings were modified so that the two builds could work together. The electro-pneumatic brake was of a similar design to the 1938 stock, but the motor generator set was rather different, as it needed to supply alternating current at 110 V and 850&nbsp;Hz. The design was influenced by problems with the fluorescent lighting supply on the sub-surface [[London Underground R Stock|R stock]], which tended to generate a loud magnetic hum. The frequency was chosen to ensure that it could not interfere with lineside signalling.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\n[[File:Morden London Underground (5).jpg|thumb|left|Trains of 1956 Stock (left) and 1959 Stock (right), for which they were the prototype, stabled at Morden Depot in 1988]]\nFour speed settings were possible, three provided by the main controller, and the fourth by a weak field flag switch. Shunt mode was used in depots and yards, and was achieved by connecting resistance banks in series with the motors. In series mode, the resistance was removed in steps, until the two motors were in series between the 600 V supply. The maximum speed in this mode was around {{convert|15|mph|kph}}. Parallel mode reconnected the motors in parallel across the supply, and allowed operation up to normal full speed. The weak field flag switch allowed higher speeds still, but was only to be operated on open sections of the line. Its operation was visible from outside of the train.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\nThe first train  began working on the Piccadilly line on 9 September 1957, and all three were operational by the following April. Trials went well, and the design became the prototype for the 1959 stock. An order for 76 seven-car trains was placed with Metro-Cammell, and the first unit entered service on 14 December 1959. All 76 were in service by 30 March 1962. Visually, they were very similar to the 1956 stock, the obvious difference being that the earlier stock had five lights on the front, which were used to display the destination of the train, and the later stock had two headlights.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |pp=87\u201388}}</ref> When the 1956 stock was delivered, it was numbered in a series starting at 40000, but when the 1959 units arrived, they were numbered from 1012 upwards, leaving space for the 1956 stock to be inserted at the start of the sequence once they had been modified to be compatible.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=89}}</ref>\n\nWhile in operational service, a number of changes were made to the vehicles. When first delivered, Wedglock automatic couplers were fitted to the motor cars in the middle of the train, which provided mechanical, pneumatic and electrical connection. The motor cars at the outside ends of the units were only fitted with mechanical couplers. These were changed to Wedglock couplers as part of the work to make them compatible with the 1959 Stock. The renumbering of the cars into the same series as the 1959 Stock took place in 1965.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=7}} In 1971\u201372, stabling lights were fitted, located at the bottom right of the five headcode lamps,{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=8}} and in 1989, the headcode lights were replaced by two headlights, although the placement was somewhat different to that of the 1959 Stock.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=11}}\n\n===Demise===\nWhen [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]] was bought to re-equip the Piccadilly line, the three 1956 Stock trains and the 1959 Stock trains were transferred to the Northern line. They continued to work there until delivery of [[London Underground 1992 Stock|1992 Stock]] began to replace the [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 Stock]] working on the Central line. A few of the 1962 Stock trains were moved to the Northern line in 1993, to enable the 1956 Stock to be withdrawn, and to provide a modest increase in the number of trains running on the line.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=12}} Initially, four cars were moved to Upminster depot, awaiting scrapping, and another four went to Golders Green depot for storage.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=91}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=J Graeme|last=Bruce\n  |title=The London Underground Tube Stock\n  |publisher=Ian Allan and London Transport Museum\n  |location=Shepperton\n  |year=1988\n  |isbn=978-0-7110-1707-8\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Brian |last=Hardy\n  |title=London Underground Rolling Stock (13th Ed.)\n  |year=1993\n  |publisher=Capital Transport\n  |isbn=978-1-85414-164-4\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Brian|last=Hardy\n  |title=Underground Train File: Tube Stock 1933-1959\n  |year=2001\n  |isbn=978-1-85414-235-1\n  |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|London Underground 1956 Stock}}\n* [https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/collections-online/photographs London Transport Museum Photographic Archive]\n** {{ltmcollection|db/i0000bdb.jpg|1956 stock DM car 42000, 1957.}}\n** {{ltmcollection|f6/i0000bf6.jpg|1956 stock interior, 1957.}}\n\n{{Northern line navbox}}\n{{Piccadilly line navbox}}\n{{London Underground Rolling Stock}}\n\n[[Category:London Underground electric multiple units|1956]]\n[[Category:Train-related introductions in 1957]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox train\n|name         = 1956 Stock\n|image        = File:Golders Green London Underground 1956 Stock.jpg\n|image_size   = x258px\n|caption      = 1008 at {{Tubestation|Golders Green}} in 1988\n|manufacturer = [[Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company|BRC&W]]<br>[[Gloucester Railway Carriage & Wagon Company|GRC&W]]<br>[[Metro-Cammell]]\n|service      = 1957\u20131995\n|family       =\n|replaced     =\n|lines        =\n|carlength    = DM {{convert|52|ft|2+5/16|in|m|2|abbr=on}}<br>NDM {{convert|51|ft|2+13/16|in|m|2|abbr=on}}<br>T {{convert|51|ft|2+13/16|in|m|2|abbr=on}}\n|trainlength  =\n|width        = {{convert|8|ft|6+1/4|in|m|3|abbr=on}}\n|height       = {{convert|9|ft|5+1/2|in|m|3|abbr=on}}\n|maxspeed     =\n|weight       = DM {{convert|26.48|LT|t ST}}<br>NDM {{convert|23.61|LT|t ST}}<br>T {{convert|20.56|LT|t ST}}\n|seating      = DM 42<br>NDM 40<br>T 40\n|stocktype    = [[London Underground infrastructure#Subsurface versus deep-level tube lines|Deep-level tube]]\n|notes        = {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|London transport}}\n}}\n\nBefore mass production of the [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 tube stock]], three '''1956 Tube Stock''' units were built as prototypes.

Each company provided a three-car and a four-car unit, the three-car unit consisting of a trailer car with a driving motor car at both ends, and the four-car units being of similar formation, but with an additional non-driving motor car in the rake.<ref name=bruce87>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=87}}</ref>\n\nWhile they were similar in many respects to the [[London Underground 1938 Stock|1938 stock]], the main differences were that the body panels were unpainted aluminium, rather than painted steel, a rubber suspension system was used on the bogies, reducing the number of parts that required regular maintenance, and the lighting was provided by fluorescent tubes, rather than incandescent bulbs. The front ends were flatter above the roof line, as the destination blind was fitted over the front cab door, rather than below the cab window. Control was provided by a PCM (Pneumatic Cam Motor) controller, supplied by [[Associated Electrical Industries]], which had proved to be reliable in the 1938 stock.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\nThe outer ends of the trains were not fitted with fully automatic couplers, so that in an emergency, two trains could be coupled together mechanically, but not electrically. Once the 1959 stock was delivered, the couplings were modified so that the two builds could work together. The electro-pneumatic brake was of a similar design to the 1938 stock, but the motor generator set was rather different, as it needed to supply alternating current at 110 V and 850&nbsp;Hz. The design was influenced by problems with the fluorescent lighting supply on the sub-surface [[London Underground R Stock|R stock]], which tended to generate a loud magnetic hum. The frequency was chosen to ensure that it could not interfere with lineside signalling.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\n[[File:Morden London Underground (5).jpg|thumb|left|Trains of 1956 Stock (left) and 1959 Stock (right), for which they were the prototype, stabled at Morden Depot in 1988]]\nFour speed settings were possible, three provided by the main controller, and the fourth by a weak field flag switch. Shunt mode was used in depots and yards, and was achieved by connecting resistance banks in series with the motors. In series mode, the resistance was removed in steps, until the two motors were in series between the 600 V supply. The maximum speed in this mode was around {{convert|15|mph|kph}}. Parallel mode reconnected the motors in parallel across the supply, and allowed operation up to normal full speed. The weak field flag switch allowed higher speeds still, but was only to be operated on open sections of the line. Its operation was visible from outside of the train.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\nThe first train  began working on the Piccadilly line on 9 September 1957, and all three were operational by the following April. Trials went well, and the design became the prototype for the 1959 stock. An order for 76 seven-car trains was placed with Metro-Cammell, and the first unit entered service on 14 December 1959. All 76 were in service by 30 March 1962. Visually, they were very similar to the 1956 stock, the obvious difference being that the earlier stock had five lights on the front, which were used to display the destination of the train, and the later stock had two headlights.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |pp=87\u201388}}</ref> When the 1956 stock was delivered, it was numbered in a series starting at 40000, but when the 1959 units arrived, they were numbered from 1012 upwards, leaving space for the 1956 stock to be inserted at the start of the sequence once they had been modified to be compatible.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=89}}</ref>\n\nWhile in operational service, a number of changes were made to the vehicles. When first delivered, Wedglock automatic couplers were fitted to the motor cars in the middle of the train, which provided mechanical, pneumatic and electrical connection. The motor cars at the outside ends of the units were only fitted with mechanical couplers. These were changed to Wedglock couplers as part of the work to make them compatible with the 1959 Stock. The renumbering of the cars into the same series as the 1959 Stock took place in 1965.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=7}} In 1971\u201372, stabling lights were fitted, located at the bottom right of the five headcode lamps,{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=8}} and in 1989, the headcode lights were replaced by two headlights, although the placement was somewhat different to that of the 1959 Stock.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=11}}\n\n===Demise===\nWhen [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]] was bought to re-equip the Piccadilly line, the three 1956 Stock trains and the 1959 Stock trains were transferred to the Northern line. They continued to work there until delivery of [[London Underground 1992 Stock|1992 Stock]] began to replace the [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 Stock]] working on the Central line. A few of the 1962 Stock trains were moved to the Northern line in 1993, to enable the 1956 Stock to be withdrawn, and to provide a modest increase in the number of trains running on the line.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=12}} Initially, four cars were moved to Upminster depot, awaiting scrapping, and another four went to Golders Green depot for storage.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=91}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=J Graeme|last=Bruce\n  |title=The London Underground Tube Stock\n  |publisher=Ian Allan and London Transport Museum\n  |location=Shepperton\n  |year=1988\n  |isbn=978-0-7110-1707-8\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Brian |last=Hardy\n  |title=London Underground Rolling Stock (13th Ed.)\n  |year=1993\n  |publisher=Capital Transport\n  |isbn=978-1-85414-164-4\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Brian|last=Hardy\n  |title=Underground Train File: Tube Stock 1933-1959\n  |year=2001\n  |isbn=978-1-85414-235-1\n  |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|London Underground 1956 Stock}}\n* [https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/collections-online/photographs London Transport Museum Photographic Archive]\n** {{ltmcollection|db/i0000bdb.jpg|1956 stock DM car 42000, 1957.}}\n** {{ltmcollection|f6/i0000bf6.jpg|1956 stock interior, 1957.}}\n\n{{Northern line navbox}}\n{{Piccadilly line navbox}}\n{{London Underground Rolling Stock}}\n\n[[Category:London Underground electric multiple units|1956]]\n[[Category:Train-related introductions in 1957]]\n", "name_user": "C2A", "label": "safe", "comment": "correcting number of seats", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground_1956_Stock"}

A total of 1,121&nbsp;cars were built by [[Metro-Cammell]] and [[Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company|Birmingham RC&W]]. An additional 173 cars were added to the fleet by the end of 1953, comprising 91 new builds (the [[London Underground 1949 Stock|1949 Tube Stock]]), 76 conversions from [[London Underground Standard Stock|Pre-1938 Tube Stock]] or [[London Underground 1935 Stock|1935 Tube Stock]], and six unconverted cars of 1935 Tube Stock,<ref>{{cite book |last=Hardy |first=Brian |title=Underground Train File: Tube Stock 1933-1959 |year=2001 |publisher=Capital Transport |location=Harrow Weald |isbn=1-85414-235-6 |page=75 |ref=harv }}</ref> and the stock was used on the London Underground until 1988. During their long lives they worked on the [[Bakerloo line|Bakerloo]], [[Northern line|Northern]], [[Piccadilly line|Piccadilly]], [[East London Line|East London]] and [[Central line (London Underground)|Central]] lines. Some examples are still at work on the [[Isle of Wight]] as [[British Rail Class 483|Class 483]], making them the oldest passenger rolling stock operating timetabled services on the [[National Rail]] network. The trains represented a major technical advance, as all the electrical equipment was located under the floor for the first time. All previous tube stock had large equipment compartments behind the driving cabs in motor cars, which reduced the space available for passengers.\n\n==Numbers==\nThere were four types of car, one of which was produced in two forms:\n* Driving Motor (DM)\n** 'A' DM \u2013 north/west facing;<ref name=\"North\">Not applicable to the Northern Line as trains are turned through 180 degrees each time they traverse the Kennington loop.</ref> solid centre buffer\n** 'D' DM \u2013 south/east facing;<ref name=\"North\" /> spring-loaded centre buffer\n* Non-Driving Motor (NDM) \u2013 no driving or door controls\n* Special Non-Driving Motor (SNDM) \u2013 door controls only\n* Trailer (T) \u2013 no motors or controls\nAs built, the 1938 Stock was numbered as follows:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! style=\"width: 15ex;\" | 'A' DM\n! style=\"width: 15ex;\" | 'D' DM\n!\n! style=\"width: 15ex;\" | NDM\n! style=\"width: 15ex;\" | SNDM\n! style=\"width: 17ex;\" | T\n|-\n|10012 \u2013 10323<br>90324 \u2013 90333\n|11012 \u2013 11323<br>91324 \u2013 91333\n|\n|12000 \u2013 12028<br>92029 \u2013 92058<br>12059 \u2013 12157<br><br><br>12409 \u2013 12411<br><br>12422 \u2013 12446<br><br>&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>92447 \u2013 92466<br>&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;<br><br><br>012158 \u2013 012388<br>092389 \u2013 092408<br><br>012412 \u2013 012421<br><br><br>012467 \u2013 012476\n|-\n! 322\n! 322\n!

The trains were primarily intended for use on the Northern and Bakerloo lines, with an additional seven trains also being used on the Piccadilly line.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAs part of the New Works Programme, the Northern and Central lines were to be extended over [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) tracks, and because of a joint working agreement between the LPTB and the LNER, it was necessary for a proportion of the Underground fleet to be owned by the LNER. Accordingly, 289 cars of 1938 Stock (DM numbers 10238\u2013323 and 11238\u2013323, NDM numbers 12117\u201357 and T numbers 012313\u201388) were designated as LNER owned, and fitted with plates marked \"Property of LNER\". Although 129 of these were to cover extensions to the Central line, none of them actually worked Central line services - they were mixed with the Northern and Bakerloo line fleets.<ref>{{cite book |last=Connor |first=Piers |title=The 1938 Tube Stock |year=1989 |publisher=Capital Transport |location=Harrow Weald |isbn=1-85414-115-5 |page=32 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hardy|2001|pp=68, 78\u201379}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Northern line was worked exclusively by 1938/1949 Stock trains. They were starting to show their age by the late 1960s; the first withdrawals from the Northern line took place in the early 1970s with the introduction of the [[London Underground 1972 Stock|1972 Stock]] trains.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the 1972 Stock (Mark II) cars began to be used on the Bakerloo line in addition to 1938 Stock. The 1972 Stock cars were intended for eventual use on the Jubilee line (which opened in 1979), thereafter the remaining section of the Bakerloo line continued to be served exclusively by 1938 Stock cars until the 1980s. The Bakerloo line trains received an \"Extra Heavy Overhaul\" (EHO) to keep them in service long after their intended withdrawal date. The Bakerloo line was thus the last line to be operated solely by 1938 Stock trains.\n\nThe Piccadilly line's few 1938 Stock trains operated alongside [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 Stock]] for much of their lives. They were replaced by [[London Underground 1973 Stock]], with the 1959 Stock being transferred to the Northern line, replacing other 1938 Stock trains.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the [[East London Line]] was worked by 1938 Stock trains, replacing trains of [[London Underground Q Stock|Q Stock]]. Single 1938 Stock trailer carriages were also inserted into [[London Underground 1960 Stock|1960 Stock]] trains in the mid-1980s; these were used on the Woodford\u2013Hainault and Epping\u2013Ongar sections of the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]]. In addition, unit 10177 (latterly shipped to Alderney) worked the Epping-Ongar shuttle between November 1957 and June 1960.\n\nWith the 1959 Stock approaching life-expiry, five ex-Bakerloo line trains of 1938 Stock were given a further overhaul in the mid-1980s. These were then used on the Northern line for a further two years, the last day of passenger service was on 19 May 1988. They were then sold for further use on the [[Isle of Wight]] (see below).\n\n==Nine-car trains==\nAs part of the [[New Works Programme|New Works Programme of 1935\u20131940]], there were plans to operate nine-car trains of 1938 stock on the Northern line. These cars were originally numbered differently from the other cars, the first digit '1' being replaced by a '9'.\n\nThe formation for a nine-car train was DM + NDM + SNDM + T + NDM + T + SNDM + NDM + DM.\n\nWith the scaling back of the planned extensions for the Northern and Bakerloo lines, and the need to order further stock to balance the fleet (the 1949 stock), cars were renumbered in the early 1950s.\nThe DMs, trailers, as well as twenty-eight of the thirty NDMs had the '9' replaced by a '1', the DMs becoming 10324-10333, 11324-11333, the trailers 012389-012408, and the NDMs 12029-12054, 12056-12057.\nNDMs 92055 and 92058 were rebuilt into Uncoupling Non-Driving Motors (UNDMs) along with all twenty SNDMs. The twenty two cars rebuilt into UNDMs were renumbered 30000-30021.\n\n==1935/1949 Stock==\nSo successful was the 1938 Stock that, when in 1948 additional cars were needed, 91 almost identical cars were built, 70 non-driving-motor (NDM) cars and 21 trailer cars. These were known as [[London Underground 1949 Stock|1949 stock]] and operated with the 1938 stock. They were numbered in the same scheme; the UNDMs were numbered 30022-30045, 31000-31045 and the trailers 012495-012515.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the former [[London Underground 1935 Stock|1935 stock]] streamlined DMs were rebuilt into trailers, and included with the 1938 stock, being renumbered 012477-012494.\nBefore the war, three trailers were built for use with the streamlined DMs. These three cars differed from the 1938 trailers in that they were not equipped with compressors. However, the cars were not delivered until after the war and with the DMs rebuilt the three cars became part of the 1938 stock fleet, being numbered 012412-012414, and fitted with compressors.\n\n==Technical==\n\n===Electrical system===\n\nEach motor car is fitted with two series [[DC motor]]s, one on each of the two bogies and are designed to operate from the 630&nbsp;volt traction supply.  Each motor has an output of approximately 250 [[horsepower]]. The controllers and switchgear are operated from a 50&nbsp;volt auxiliary supply provided by a [[motor-generator]] set.  This system allows the master controller at one end of the train to simultaneously operate the switchgear on all the motor cars in a similar manner to the system developed by [[Frank J. Sprague|Sprague]] for the [[South Side Elevated Railroad|Elevated railway]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] some 46 years earlier.  This same supply is also used to power the train lighting as well as some other auxiliary circuits.\n\n==='A' and 'D' motor cars===\n\nThe motor cars are divided into two distinct types, the 'A' end car and the 'D' end car.  Each of the bogies fitted to the two cars are identical.  This means that if the two motor cars at the two ends of a train were identical, they would attempt to pull the train in opposite directions.  Consequently, the bogies on the 'D' end motor car are installed the other way around from those on the 'A' end causing the two motor cars to move the train in the same direction.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe 'A' and 'D' designation is from the designation of the axles on the two bogies.  The 'A' end car has the 'A' axle at the driving cab end of the car with the 'B' axle on the opposite end of the same bogie.  The 'C' axle on the second bogie is nearest the driving cab with the 'D' axle closest to the coupled trailer car.  The sequence is reversed on the 'D' end motor car.  This is also why the alternate car is not designated the logically more obvious 'B' end.<ref>The two ends of most older style trams were identified as 'A' and 'B' (marked on the inside of the driving position).  This was a reminder to the electrical maintenance staff to reverse the field connections at the 'B' end relative to those at the 'A' end.</ref>\n\nAnother mechanical difference between the two types of car is that the 'D' end car has a spring-loaded buffer at the driving cab end whereas the 'A' end car has a solid buffer.\n\nThese differences mean that when coupling two train sets together, the 'A' end of one set must be coupled to the 'D' end of the other.  Although train sets are not normally split in day to day usage, they do have to be split when undergoing major maintenance tasks such as when the bodies are lifted off of the bogies.  This is not a problem on most lines where all the train sets start and remain the same way around.  However, on the Northern line the existence of the Kennington loop just south of Kennington station which allows Charing Cross branch trains to depart its southbound platform and arrive at its northbound platform reverses the complete train once every journey.  This means that on this line, on average, half the trains will be facing the opposite direction to the remainder.  Only sets facing the same way can be coupled together.\n\n===Traction control===\n\nThe 1938 design stock features the (by this time) standard series/parallel traction control using bridge transition.<!-- This needs an article. --->  The control system has an unusual feature.<!-- Information needed as to whether this was deliberate or an unintentional quirk. --->  Ordinarilly, the driver moves the master controller from 'off' up to 'full series' and then further to the 'full parallel' position when the train will be under full power.\n\nThe unusual feature is that once the driver has moved the controller to 'full parallel' and the train has accelerated to the point where the switchgear is actually in full parallel,<ref>Although the driver can select 'full parallel' the switchgear itself only allows the mechanism to select the next step in the accelerating sequence once the train is moving fast enough.</ref> the driver can then move the master controller back to 'full series'.  The traction switchgear will remain in 'full parallel' unless the driver moves the master controller from 'full series' to any position towards 'off'.  Many drivers took advantage of this feature because it was more comfortable maintaining the downward pressure on the [[deadman's handle]] with the handle at the 6 o'clock position (the 'full series' position) rather than the 9 o'clock position (the 'full parallel' position).\n\n==58 trailers==\nIn 1938 fifty-eight [[London Underground Standard Stock|'Standard Stock']] trailers, originally built in 1927, were converted to operate with the 1938 Stock. These cars were renumbered 70513\u201370570. The first car withdrawn was 70550, as a result of damage sustained in an accident at [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]] in 1962, and the last car, 70534, was withdrawn in 1973.\n\n==Isle of Wight==\n{{main|British Rail Class 483}}\n[[File:483008 Arrives Shanklin.jpg|thumb|Island Line Class 483 No. 008 arrives at Shanklin]]\n[[File:483006 Interior.jpg|right|thumb|The interior of a Class 483]]\nIn 1988, ten sets of 1938 stock were bought by [[Network SouthEast]] for use on the [[Island Line, Isle of Wight|Island Line]] service on the [[Isle of Wight]], and were allocated two-car [[TOPS]] [[British Rail Class 483|Class 483]]. These units were heavily rebuilt and introduced between 1989 and 1992 to replace the even older [[British Rail Classes 485 and 486|Class 485 and 486]] trains that had been running on the line since 1967, also constructed from ex-Tube stock. Four sets have been scrapped, while six remain in service. As of 2018, the Class 483s are the oldest stock in mainline usage in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe units were leased from [[Eversholt Rail Group|HSBC Rail]] until [[South West Trains]] bought them outright in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islandpulse.co.uk/b2/isle-of-wight-island-line-independence/|title=\u2018Wagons Roll\u2019 Towards Island Line Independence.|date=28 March 2007|accessdate=18 September 2007|publisher=[[Island Pulse]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223013741/http://www.islandpulse.co.uk/b2/isle-of-wight-island-line-independence/|archivedate=23 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter running many years in Network SouthEast (NSE) colours, the trains were repainted into a [[Dinosaur]] themed livery to celebrate the Isle of Wight's rich palaeontological history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, due to customer dissatfisfaction, all trains returned to an approximation of their original LT train red livery; albeit with yellow fronts, as per mainline regulations in 2008.

During their long lives they worked on the [[Bakerloo line|Bakerloo]], [[Northern line|Northern]], [[Piccadilly line|Piccadilly]], [[East London Line|East London]] and [[Central line (London Underground)|Central]] lines. Some examples are still at work on the [[Isle of Wight]] as [[British Rail Class 483|Class 483]], making them the oldest passenger rolling stock operating timetabled services on the [[National Rail]] network. The trains represented a major technical advance, as all the electrical equipment was located under the floor for the first time. All previous tube stock had large equipment compartments behind the driving cabs in motor cars, which reduced the space available for passengers.\n\n==Numbers==\nThere were four types of car, one of which was produced in two forms:\n* Driving Motor (DM)\n** 'A' DM \u2013 north/west facing;<ref name=\"North\">Not applicable to the Northern Line as trains are turned through 180 degrees each time they traverse the Kennington loop.</ref> solid centre buffer\n** 'D' DM \u2013 south/east facing;<ref name=\"North\" /> spring-loaded centre buffer\n* Non-Driving Motor (NDM) \u2013 no driving or door controls\n* Special Non-Driving Motor (SNDM) \u2013 door controls only\n* Trailer (T) \u2013 no motors or controls\nAs built, the 1938 Stock was numbered as follows:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! style=\"width: 15ex;\" | 'A' DM\n! style=\"width: 15ex;\" | 'D' DM\n!\n! style=\"width: 15ex;\" | NDM\n! style=\"width: 15ex;\" | SNDM\n! style=\"width: 17ex;\" | T\n|-\n|10012 \u2013 10323<br>90324 \u2013 90333\n|11012 \u2013 11323<br>91324 \u2013 91333\n|\n|12000 \u2013 12028<br>92029 \u2013 92058<br>12059 \u2013 12157<br><br><br>12409 \u2013 12411<br><br>12422 \u2013 12446<br><br>&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>92447 \u2013 92466<br>&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;<br><br><br>012158 \u2013 012388<br>092389 \u2013 092408<br><br>012412 \u2013 012421<br><br><br>012467 \u2013 012476\n|-\n! 322\n! 322\n!

The trains were primarily intended for use on the Northern and Bakerloo lines, with an additional seven trains also being used on the Piccadilly line.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAs part of the New Works Programme, the Northern and Central lines were to be extended over [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) tracks, and because of a joint working agreement between the LPTB and the LNER, it was necessary for a proportion of the Underground fleet to be owned by the LNER. Accordingly, 289 cars of 1938 Stock (DM numbers 10238\u2013323 and 11238\u2013323, NDM numbers 12117\u201357 and T numbers 012313\u201388) were designated as LNER owned, and fitted with plates marked \"Property of LNER\". Although 129 of these were to cover extensions to the Central line, none of them actually worked Central line services - they were mixed with the Northern and Bakerloo line fleets.<ref>{{cite book |last=Connor |first=Piers |title=The 1938 Tube Stock |year=1989 |publisher=Capital Transport |location=Harrow Weald |isbn=1-85414-115-5 |page=32 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hardy|2001|pp=68, 78\u201379}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Northern line was worked exclusively by 1938/1949 Stock trains.

The 1972 Stock cars were intended for eventual use on the Jubilee line (which opened in 1979), thereafter the remaining section of the Bakerloo line continued to be served exclusively by 1938 Stock cars until the 1980s. The Bakerloo line trains received an \"Extra Heavy Overhaul\" (EHO) to keep them in service long after their intended withdrawal date. The Bakerloo line was thus the last line to be operated solely by 1938 Stock trains.\n\nThe Piccadilly line's few 1938 Stock trains operated alongside [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 Stock]] for much of their lives. They were replaced by [[London Underground 1973 Stock]], with the 1959 Stock being transferred to the Northern line, replacing other 1938 Stock trains.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the [[East London Line]] was worked by 1938 Stock trains, replacing trains of [[London Underground Q Stock|Q Stock]]. Single 1938 Stock trailer carriages were also inserted into [[London Underground 1960 Stock|1960 Stock]] trains in the mid-1980s; these were used on the Woodford\u2013Hainault and Epping\u2013Ongar sections of the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]]. In addition, unit 10177 (latterly shipped to Alderney) worked the Epping-Ongar shuttle between November 1957 and June 1960.\n\nWith the 1959 Stock approaching life-expiry, five ex-Bakerloo line trains of 1938 Stock were given a further overhaul in the mid-1980s. These were then used on the Northern line for a further two years, the last day of passenger service was on 19 May 1988. They were then sold for further use on the [[Isle of Wight]] (see below).\n\n==Nine-car trains==\nAs part of the [[New Works Programme|New Works Programme of 1935\u20131940]], there were plans to operate nine-car trains of 1938 stock on the Northern line. These cars were originally numbered differently from the other cars, the first digit '1' being replaced by a '9'.\n\nThe formation for a nine-car train was DM + NDM + SNDM + T + NDM + T + SNDM + NDM + DM.\n\nWith the scaling back of the planned extensions for the Northern and Bakerloo lines, and the need to order further stock to balance the fleet (the 1949 stock), cars were renumbered in the early 1950s.\nThe DMs, trailers, as well as twenty-eight of the thirty NDMs had the '9' replaced by a '1', the DMs becoming 10324-10333, 11324-11333, the trailers 012389-012408, and the NDMs 12029-12054, 12056-12057.\nNDMs 92055 and 92058 were rebuilt into Uncoupling Non-Driving Motors (UNDMs) along with all twenty SNDMs. The twenty two cars rebuilt into UNDMs were renumbered 30000-30021.\n\n==1935/1949 Stock==\nSo successful was the 1938 Stock that, when in 1948 additional cars were needed, 91 almost identical cars were built, 70 non-driving-motor (NDM) cars and 21 trailer cars. These were known as [[London Underground 1949 Stock|1949 stock]] and operated with the 1938 stock. They were numbered in the same scheme; the UNDMs were numbered 30022-30045, 31000-31045 and the trailers 012495-012515.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the former [[London Underground 1935 Stock|1935 stock]] streamlined DMs were rebuilt into trailers, and included with the 1938 stock, being renumbered 012477-012494.\nBefore the war, three trailers were built for use with the streamlined DMs. These three cars differed from the 1938 trailers in that they were not equipped with compressors. However, the cars were not delivered until after the war and with the DMs rebuilt the three cars became part of the 1938 stock fleet, being numbered 012412-012414, and fitted with compressors.\n\n==Technical==\n\n===Electrical system===\n\nEach motor car is fitted with two series [[DC motor]]s, one on each of the two bogies and are designed to operate from the 630&nbsp;volt traction supply.  Each motor has an output of approximately 250 [[horsepower]]. The controllers and switchgear are operated from a 50&nbsp;volt auxiliary supply provided by a [[motor-generator]] set.  This system allows the master controller at one end of the train to simultaneously operate the switchgear on all the motor cars in a similar manner to the system developed by [[Frank J. Sprague|Sprague]] for the [[South Side Elevated Railroad|Elevated railway]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] some 46 years earlier.  This same supply is also used to power the train lighting as well as some other auxiliary circuits.\n\n==='A' and 'D' motor cars===\n\nThe motor cars are divided into two distinct types, the 'A' end car and the 'D' end car.  Each of the bogies fitted to the two cars are identical.  This means that if the two motor cars at the two ends of a train were identical, they would attempt to pull the train in opposite directions.  Consequently, the bogies on the 'D' end motor car are installed the other way around from those on the 'A' end causing the two motor cars to move the train in the same direction.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe 'A' and 'D' designation is from the designation of the axles on the two bogies.  The 'A' end car has the 'A' axle at the driving cab end of the car with the 'B' axle on the opposite end of the same bogie.  The 'C' axle on the second bogie is nearest the driving cab with the 'D' axle closest to the coupled trailer car.  The sequence is reversed on the 'D' end motor car.  This is also why the alternate car is not designated the logically more obvious 'B' end.<ref>The two ends of most older style trams were identified as 'A' and 'B' (marked on the inside of the driving position).  This was a reminder to the electrical maintenance staff to reverse the field connections at the 'B' end relative to those at the 'A' end.</ref>\n\nAnother mechanical difference between the two types of car is that the 'D' end car has a spring-loaded buffer at the driving cab end whereas the 'A' end car has a solid buffer.\n\nThese differences mean that when coupling two train sets together, the 'A' end of one set must be coupled to the 'D' end of the other.  Although train sets are not normally split in day to day usage, they do have to be split when undergoing major maintenance tasks such as when the bodies are lifted off of the bogies.  This is not a problem on most lines where all the train sets start and remain the same way around.  However, on the Northern line the existence of the Kennington loop just south of Kennington station which allows Charing Cross branch trains to depart its southbound platform and arrive at its northbound platform reverses the complete train once every journey.  This means that on this line, on average, half the trains will be facing the opposite direction to the remainder.  Only sets facing the same way can be coupled together.\n\n===Traction control===\n\nThe 1938 design stock features the (by this time) standard series/parallel traction control using bridge transition.<!-- This needs an article. --->  The control system has an unusual feature.<!-- Information needed as to whether this was deliberate or an unintentional quirk. --->  Ordinarilly, the driver moves the master controller from 'off' up to 'full series' and then further to the 'full parallel' position when the train will be under full power.\n\nThe unusual feature is that once the driver has moved the controller to 'full parallel' and the train has accelerated to the point where the switchgear is actually in full parallel,<ref>Although the driver can select 'full parallel' the switchgear itself only allows the mechanism to select the next step in the accelerating sequence once the train is moving fast enough.</ref> the driver can then move the master controller back to 'full series'.  The traction switchgear will remain in 'full parallel' unless the driver moves the master controller from 'full series' to any position towards 'off'.  Many drivers took advantage of this feature because it was more comfortable maintaining the downward pressure on the [[deadman's handle]] with the handle at the 6 o'clock position (the 'full series' position) rather than the 9 o'clock position (the 'full parallel' position).\n\n==58 trailers==\nIn 1938 fifty-eight [[London Underground Standard Stock|'Standard Stock']] trailers, originally built in 1927, were converted to operate with the 1938 Stock. These cars were renumbered 70513\u201370570. The first car withdrawn was 70550, as a result of damage sustained in an accident at [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]] in 1962, and the last car, 70534, was withdrawn in 1973.\n\n==Isle of Wight==\n{{main|British Rail Class 483}}\n[[File:483008 Arrives Shanklin.jpg|thumb|Island Line Class 483 No. 008 arrives at Shanklin]]\n[[File:483006 Interior.jpg|right|thumb|The interior of a Class 483]]\nIn 1988, ten sets of 1938 stock were bought by [[Network SouthEast]] for use on the [[Island Line, Isle of Wight|Island Line]] service on the [[Isle of Wight]], and were allocated two-car [[TOPS]] [[British Rail Class 483|Class 483]].

Four sets have been scrapped, while six remain in service. As of 2018, the Class 483s are the oldest stock in mainline usage in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe units were leased from [[Eversholt Rail Group|HSBC Rail]] until [[South West Trains]] bought them outright in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islandpulse.co.uk/b2/isle-of-wight-island-line-independence/|title=\u2018Wagons Roll\u2019 Towards Island Line Independence.|date=28 March 2007|accessdate=18 September 2007|publisher=[[Island Pulse]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223013741/http://www.islandpulse.co.uk/b2/isle-of-wight-island-line-independence/|archivedate=23 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter running many years in Network SouthEast (NSE) colours, the trains were repainted into a [[Dinosaur]] themed livery to celebrate the Isle of Wight's rich palaeontological history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, due to customer dissatfisfaction, all trains returned to an approximation of their original LT train red livery; albeit with yellow fronts, as per mainline regulations in 2008.

The ''Tribune'' wrote that the [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]] of Willow Creek had conducted an internal review of Hybels' behavior which led to no findings of misconduct; following this report, at least three leaders of the Willow Creek Association board reportedly resigned their posts because they believed the inquiry to have been insufficient.

A young Greek monk falls in love with a Russian nun. The story looks at the struggle between religious devotion, temptations of the flesh, the yearning of the human heart, and the role of the individual within the community of believers. The two communicate with each other across the valley using mirrors to flash a [[morse code]] signal, with lights dancing on the wall of her cell in the Agios Stefano Convent, also set on a rock pinnacle.\n\nThe film  is set in Central Greece, where medieval monasteries perch on the apex of hugely dramatic sandstone pinnacles, and the main access is to be hauled up in a net tied to a rope. A steep set of steps also access from one side. Views are breath-taking, and often in extreme long-shot, with human figures appearing as small black dots on the screen.\n\nThe monks and nuns obey the rituals of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in this austere environment, remote from modern human life in every sense with the strong rhythm of prayer and asceticism.\n\nBasic food (bread and milk) is delivered to the monks by the nuns, and winched up using the same net and rope system used for the monks themselves. There is no electricity, and lighting is by means of oil lamps.

A young Greek monk falls in love with a Russian nun. The story looks at the struggle between religious devotion, temptations of the flesh, the yearning of the human heart, and the role of the individual within the community of believers. The two communicate with each other across the valley using mirrors to flash a [[morse code]] signal, with lights dancing on the wall of her cell in the Agios Stefano Convent, also set on a rock pinnacle.\n\nThe film  is set in Central Greece, where medieval monasteries perch on the apex of hugely dramatic sandstone pinnacles, and the main access is to be hauled up in a net tied to a rope. A steep set of steps also access from one side. Views are breath-taking, and often in extreme long-shot, with human figures appearing as small black dots on the screen.\n\nThe monks and nuns obey the rituals of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in this austere environment, remote from modern human life in every sense with the strong rhythm of prayer and asceticism.\n\nBasic food (bread and milk) is delivered to the monks by the nuns, and winched up using the same net and rope system used for the monks themselves. There is no electricity, and lighting is by means of oil lamps. Music in the monastery is limited to rhythmic hammering on a suspended wooden board and a few bells.\n\nThe film is interspersed with animation, based on ancient Greek icons.\n\n\"Meteora\" means \"lifted into heights\" or \"afloat\", as is the case of the two lovers whose emotions are  in such a state - in limbo between their belief and their desire.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Theo Alexander]] as Brother Georgi\n* [[Tamila Koulieva]] as the nun with the injured hand\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|2180473|Meteora}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Meteora}}\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:2012 drama films]]\n[[Category:Greek films]]\n[[Category:Greek drama films]]\n[[Category:Greek-language films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Thessaly]]\n[[Category:Films set in Thessaly]]\n{{Greece-film-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Lugnuts", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteora_(film)"}
