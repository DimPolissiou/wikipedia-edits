The major reason SARS was formed was when Col. Rindam, a [[Nigerian Army]] Colonel was killed by police officers at a checkpoint in [[Lagos]]. When the information reached the army, soldiers were dispatched into the streets of [[Lagos]] in search of any police officer. The Nigerian police withdrew from checkpoints, security areas and other points to interest for criminals, some police officers were said to have resigned while others fled for their lives. Due to the absence of [[police]] for two weeks crime rate increased and SARS was formed with only 15 officers operating in the shadows without knowledge of the army while monitoring police radio chatters. Due to the existence of already established three anti-robbery squad which was operational at that time, Midenda needed to distinguish his squad from the already existing teams. Midenda named his team ''Special Anti-Robbery Squad'' ('''SARS'''). After months of dialogue the [[Nigerian Army]] and the [[Nigeria Police Force]] came to an understanding and official police duties began again in [[Lagos]]. The SARS unit was officially commissioned in Lagos following a ceasefire by the army after settlement.\n\nSARS is one the 14 units in the [[Force Criminal Investigations Department|Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department]] which was established to detain, investigate and prosecute people involved in crimes like armed robbery, kidnapping and other forms of crimes.\n\nIn 2009, after several years of operations the squad grew in number and strength. Due to the surge of internet fraudsters and cultism in universities, SARS operatives infiltrated Nigerian universities, made several successful arrest but in the process harassed innocent youths.

The major reason SARS was formed was when Col. Rindam, a [[Nigerian Army]] Colonel was killed by police officers at a checkpoint in [[Lagos]]. When the information reached the army, soldiers were dispatched into the streets of [[Lagos]] in search of any police officer. The Nigerian police withdrew from checkpoints, security areas and other points to interest for criminals, some police officers were said to have resigned while others fled for their lives. Due to the absence of [[police]] for two weeks crime rate increased and SARS was formed with only 15 officers operating in the shadows without knowledge of the army while monitoring police radio chatters. Due to the existence of already established three anti-robbery squad which was operational at that time, Midenda needed to distinguish his squad from the already existing teams. Midenda named his team ''Special Anti-Robbery Squad'' ('''SARS'''). After months of dialogue the [[Nigerian Army]] and the [[Nigeria Police Force]] came to an understanding and official police duties began again in [[Lagos]]. The SARS unit was officially commissioned in Lagos following a ceasefire by the army after settlement.\n\nSARS is one the 14 units in the [[Force Criminal Investigations Department|Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department]] which was established to detain, investigate and prosecute people involved in crimes like armed robbery, kidnapping and other forms of crimes.\n\nIn 2009, after several years of operations the squad grew in number and strength. Due to the surge of internet fraudsters and cultism in universities, SARS operatives infiltrated Nigerian universities, made several successful arrest but in the process harassed innocent youths. According to a publication by Pulse.ng a Nigerian news website, \"''What SARS became was a national scourge that a witch-hunt machinery against Nigerian youth with dreadlocks, piercings, cars, expensive phones and risque means of expression.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/endsars-what-exactly-is-the-status-of-sars/fsret4e|title=#EndSARS: What exactly is the status of SARS?|date=2019-01-23|website=Pulse Nigeria|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2010, [[Amnesty International]] disclosed that it would be suing the Nigerian Police over Humans Rights Abuse stating that the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in [[Borokiri|Borokiri, Port Harcourt]] arrested three bike riders and detained them for over one week while being ''\"beaten every night with the butt of a gun and iron belt.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2010/05/27/amnesty-slams-nigeria-for-rights-abuse/|title=Amnesty Slams Nigeria For Rights Abuse|date=2010-05-27|website=P.M.

It is scooped up and eaten with the staple whole wheat pita bread called ''Eish Masri'' or ''Eish Baladi'' ([[Egyptian Arabic]]: {{lang|arz|\u0639\u064a\u0634}} {{IPA-arz|\u0295e\u02d0\u0283|}}; [[Modern Standard Arabic]]: ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfay\u0161}}'') and usually accompanied by ''ta\u02bfamiya'' ({{lang-arz|\u0637\u0639\u0645\u064a\u0629}}) which is the local variant of [[falafel]] made with fava beans, fresh cut homemade [[French fries]] and various fresh or pickled vegetables (called [[torshi]]). Several kinds of cheeses are popular, including ''{{Transl|arz|gebna b\u0113\u1e0da}}'' or [[Domyati]] cheese, ''{{transl|arz|gebna r\u016bmi}}'' (Roman cheese) which is similar to ''[[Pecorino Romano]]'' or ''[[Manchego]]'', and Istanbuli cheese (a brined white cheese with peppers added to the brine which makes it spicy).

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children.

Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]].

''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast.

Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea. [[Breakfast cereals]] or [[muesli]] with milk, yogurt or [[filmj\u00f6lk]], currants, and fruits are popular or warm [[whole-grain]] porridge with milk and jam (for example [[lingonberry jam]]).<ref>Rutiga kokboken, 2002, {{ISBN|91-534-1950-2}}</ref> [[Bilberry]]-soup ([[bl\u00e5b\u00e4rssoppa]]) and [[rose hip soup]] are also possible breakfast alternatives.\n\n===Switzerland===\n[[Switzerland|Swiss]] breakfasts are often similar to those eaten in neighboring countries.

Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

Black coffee or coffee with milk are traditional drinks. As this is the most common breakfast of the country, in [[Lim\u00f3n Province]] they prepare gallo pinto with coconut milk instead. Another popular breakfast food is the \"chorreadas\" which are savory sweetcorn pancakes; they are usually accompanied by cheese or a type of sour cream called \"natilla\".<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Costa Rica]]</ref>\n\n===Cuba===\nBreakfast in urban areas traditionally consists of [[caf\u00e9 con leche]] that is sweetened and includes a pinch of salt. Toasted buttered [[Cuban bread]], cut into lengths, is dunked in the coffee.

Normally accompanied by orange juice and other juices of fruits typical to the region. Milk punch (milk, egg, nutmeg, and malt) boiled eggs with \"harina de negrito\" or some other type of cornstarch. Traditional breakfast bread is a water-based bread.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Rep\u00fablica Dominicana]]</ref>\n\n===Guatemala===\nIn [[Guatemala]], breakfast consists of one or two eggs either fried, scrambled, or boiled accompanied by baked/fried beans with coffee. With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk. Then, a plate of food with beans, alongside eggs that can be scrambled or sunny side up, slivers of fried plantain (or [[cooking plantain]]), corn, tortillas, cheese, and butter. Versions of egg preparation vary: \"estrellados\" which consists of just cracking the shell, in \"torta\" or omelette (beaten with some salt), scrambled or boiled. Another typical breakfast are the [[baleadas]] and tortillas with cheese; sometimes they are fried together with cheese in between. In the \"gar\u00edfuna\" culture, coffee is accompanied by \"m\u00ednimo\" bread (banana bread) or coconut bread.\n\n===Jamaica===\nA Jamaican breakfast includes [[ackee and saltfish]], seasoned [[callaloo]], boiled [[green banana]]s, and [[jonnycake|fried dumplings]].<ref name=\"breakfast\">Deborah S.

It always includes black coffee (tinto) or with milk (called pintado) with any of these sides: corn tortillas, traditional white cheese (or queso del pais), another type of tortillas or \"torrejas\" made of wheat flour known as \"[[hojaldres]].\" Another traditional breakfast side is \"[[bollo]]\" made out of either corn, white corn, or coconut that is wrapped in corn leaves and \"pre\u00f1a'o\" (meaning with child) that means it's filled with some type of meat.\n\nAs protein, a large serving of beef liver with onion, scrambled or fried eggs, beef stew or \"tasajo\" (a type of beef jerky), pork rinds and different kinds of sausages like chorizo or ''[[morcilla]]'' are the most popular. These are also accompanied by: slices of green plantain or [[cooking plantain]], \"[[patacones]]\" (double fried plantain), [[carima\u00f1ola]]s (yuca filled with meat), as well as different bread pastries both savory and sweet. These large breakfasts are normally reserved for special occasions while everyday breakfasts consist of more traditional food from the west like toast, ham, cheese, jam etc.\n\nIt is important to mention that the prolonged US presence has also influenced urban areas of Panama by introducing meals like cereal with milk as well as pancakes with syrup as traditional breakfast meals.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Panam\u00e1]]</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of American breakfast foods}}\n[[File:NYC-Diner-ToGo-Overeasy-Eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an American diner breakfast, with overeasy eggs, home fries, bacon, and buttered toast]]\nThe average starting time for breakfasts in the United States has been found to be 8:12&nbsp;a.m, and varies from 8:08&nbsp;a.m. in the South to 8:17&nbsp;a.m. in the West.<ref>{{Citation|last=Larson|first=Robert B.|title=When is Dinner?|date=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=38\u201345|periodical=Journal of Food Distribution Research|doi=10.22004/ag.econ.26834|issn=2643-3354}}</ref> Breakfast often consists of a combination of hot or cold cereals, eggs, breakfast meats, and breakfast quick breads such as [[pancake]]s, [[waffle]]s, or [[biscuit]]s.

Several kinds of cheeses are popular, including ''{{Transl|arz|gebna b\u0113\u1e0da}}'' or [[Domyati]] cheese, ''{{transl|arz|gebna r\u016bmi}}'' (Roman cheese) which is similar to ''[[Pecorino Romano]]'' or ''[[Manchego]]'', and Istanbuli cheese (a brined white cheese with peppers added to the brine which makes it spicy).

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

''[[Tieguanyin]]'' is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as ''[[pu'er tea|pu'er]]'' and ''[[oolong]]'' are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast. Thus there is no single standard Indian breakfast, with items changing with regions. However, one can broadly classify breakfast varieties in India into two types: North Indian and South Indian.

Other popular south Indian breakfast items are [[Pongal (dish)|pongal]], [[bisibelebath]] (sambar rice), [[upma]], and [[poori]].

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast.

Usually the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] start their day with a bowl of cereal mixed with milk, sometimes with a cup of coffee or tea. Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]]. Another type of sweet toppings are the chocolate toppings; the Dutch have chocolate toppings in all variations: ''[[hagelslag]]'' (chocolate sprinkles), ''[[Vlokken|chocoladevlokken]]'' (chocolate flakes) (both typically Dutch), and ''chocoladepasta ''([[chocolate spread]]).<ref name=\"wintle\">{{cite book|last=Wintle|first=Michael|editor=Thomas M.

A perfect \"weekend breakfast\" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg.

More ample breakfasts may include fish, a diverse array of cheese, eggs, bacon, breads, and hot and cold cereals eaten in various combinations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Pastries such as [[croissants]] or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' have become increasingly common since the 1990s.\n\n===Poland===\nThe traditional Polish breakfast is a large spread with a variety of sides eaten with bread or toast. Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, [[Swiss cheese]], and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

In [[Madrid]], ''churros'' are somewhat smaller and shaped like a [[charity ribbon]].{{clarify|date=October 2015}} This meal is normally served in cafeter\u00edas but it is not a regular or usual breakfast at Madrid homes. The usual one is the same as in the rest of Spain: coffee with milk or [[Cola Cao]], orange juice, biscuits or toasts, with butter and jam.\n\nIn the North, East and West it is more common to have a cup of coffee (usually with milk) or [[Cola Cao]] and a toast with a choice of [[olive oil]] and salt, [[tomato]] and olive oil, [[butter]], jam, p\u00e2t\u00e9, ''[[jam\u00f3n serrano]]'' (cured ham), and other options like ''[[Sobrassada|sobrasada]]'' (a raw cured spiced sausage that is easy to spread),<ref>Unesco, [http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00394 The Mediterranean diet]</ref> and in [[Andalucia]], ''[[pring\u00e1]]''. Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea. [[Breakfast cereals]] or [[muesli]] with milk, yogurt or [[filmj\u00f6lk]], currants, and fruits are popular or warm [[whole-grain]] porridge with milk and jam (for example [[lingonberry jam]]).<ref>Rutiga kokboken, 2002, {{ISBN|91-534-1950-2}}</ref> [[Bilberry]]-soup ([[bl\u00e5b\u00e4rssoppa]]) and [[rose hip soup]] are also possible breakfast alternatives.\n\n===Switzerland===\n[[Switzerland|Swiss]] breakfasts are often similar to those eaten in neighboring countries.

Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk.

Many historic homes with classic [[Italianate architecture]] like the Werribee Mansion at [[Werribee Park]], in Victoria, Australia west of Melbourne, show good examples of recent tuckpointing which display the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between the bluestone architecture.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Bricks]]\n[[Category:Stonemasonry]]\n", "name_user": "Readaroo", "label": "safe", "comment": "added a news link and made some grammar edits", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckpointing"}
