It was the group's first album to be certified gold by the [[RIAA]]<ref name=DeadDisc/> and remained their best seller until surpassed by ''[[Skeletons from the Closet: The Best of Grateful Dead|Skeletons from the Closet]]''.\n\n==Recording and release==\nUnlike ''[[Live/Dead]]'', the album contained several lead and background vocal overdubs. For the three new original compositions (\"Bertha\", \"[[Playing in the Band]]\", and \"Wharf Rat\"), the band invited [[Jerry Garcia]] associate [[Merl Saunders]] to overdub [[organ (music)|organ]] parts. This made the organ playing of Saunders more prominent than that of [[Ron McKernan|Pigpen]], whose contributions tend to be buried in the mix.\n\n\"Playing in the Band\" received a good amount of airplay, and became one of the Dead's most played songs in concert (a studio version was released the following year on rhythm guitarist [[Bob Weir]]'s solo album ''[[Ace (Bob Weir album)|Ace]]'').<ref name=DeadBase/> The closing segue of \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" into \"Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad\" also received airplay and became a fan favorite.\n\nThe album's [[cover art]], composed by [[Alton Kelly]] and [[Stanley Mouse]], is based on an illustration by [[Edmund Joseph Sullivan]] for an old edition of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]''.<ref name=DeadDisc/> Though the album has been known by the sobriquet \"Skull & Roses\", the original vertical gatefold cover unfolds to reveal the entire skeleton. The graphic became one of the [[Grateful_Dead#Artwork|images most associated with the band]].\n\nOpening track \"Bertha\" fades in on the original version of the album, in semblance of entering the performance space. A longer, full opening is used on CD/digital copies. More tracks from the same source concerts were later released on ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen... the Grateful Dead]]''.\n\nThe [[Single (music)#Types|7\" single]] release of \"Johnny B. Goode\" (a [[split album|split single]] with [[Elvin Bishop]]) was actually the version from the album ''[[Fillmore: The Last Days]]''. However, the version from this album was later used as a B-side on the re-release of the \"[[Truckin%27|Truckin']]\" single.\n\nThe album was remastered and expanded for the 2001 box set ''[[The Golden Road (1965-1973)|The Golden Road]]''. This version, with three bonus tracks (two contemporaneous live tracks and a hidden promotional track) and the extended \"Bertha\", was released separately, in 2003.\n\n==Title and message==\n{{Wiktionary|mind-blowing}}\nWhen the band submitted \"Skull Fuck\" (a contemporary euphemism for \"blow your mind\") as the album title, it was rejected by the record label. Ultimately the agreement was made that the album would be published without the title appearing anywhere on the record labels or cover artwork. Though the band refers to the album by this title, and it has long been known to fans (through interviews with band members, the [[Deadhead]] network and other outlets), the alternate, descriptive title \"Skull & Roses\" developed among distributors, music buyers and reviewers as a graphic [[incipit]] from the cover artwork.\n\nDrummer Bill Kreutzmann explained the lack of a title on the artwork and labels, \"...the original name was going to be \"Skull Fuck\". This was a time long before rap artists like [[Eminem]] numbed concerned citizens to the idea of offensive language in music. [[Warner_Bros._Records|Warner Brothers]] freaked out on us. They said stores would boycott it and we wouldn't be able to get it on shelves.\"<ref name=Untitled/>\n\nInside the gatefold of the original LP, the band reached out directly to its burgeoning fan base, which had begun to attend multiple concerts in a row and collect live audio tapes of each concert, with a message reading:{{cquote|<center>DEAD FREAKS UNITE: Who are you?

The following year, Drones founder Gareth Liddiard and longtime bandmate Fiona Kitschin started writing material for a new project under the name for the record label they'd coined to self-release the last Drones album. They recruited Erica Dunn and Lauren Hammel during the summer of 2017, before embarking on an American tour. According to Dunn, \"They just rang me up. Gareth and Fi were on loudspeaker like excited children. The pitch was 'Do you want to play guitar? We\u2019re just going to do some weird shit.' And I was like 'Okay, sure.' Then Gareth said 'We might go to America in the next month, are you free? And we have to write some songs.' Sure I'll clear my schedule. Hammer [Lauren Hammel] was a bit different though, because [Gareth] didn't know her and he had to take her to the pub.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/xw7bbk/tropical-fuck-storm-album-stream-premiere-interview-gareth-liddiard-2018|title=Tropical Fuck Storm Have the Best Band Name (and An Even Better Album)|date=2018-05-02|work=Noisey|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThey released a series of 7-inch singles later that autumn while on tour with [[Band of Horses]] and [[King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard]] in the US.

The following year, Drones founder Gareth Liddiard and longtime bandmate Fiona Kitschin started writing material for a new project under the name for the record label they'd coined to self-release the last Drones album. They recruited Erica Dunn and Lauren Hammel during the summer of 2017, before embarking on an American tour. According to Dunn, \"They just rang me up. Gareth and Fi were on loudspeaker like excited children. The pitch was 'Do you want to play guitar? We\u2019re just going to do some weird shit.' And I was like 'Okay, sure.' Then Gareth said 'We might go to America in the next month, are you free? And we have to write some songs.' Sure I'll clear my schedule. Hammer [Lauren Hammel] was a bit different though, because [Gareth] didn't know her and he had to take her to the pub.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/xw7bbk/tropical-fuck-storm-album-stream-premiere-interview-gareth-liddiard-2018|title=Tropical Fuck Storm Have the Best Band Name (and An Even Better Album)|date=2018-05-02|work=Noisey|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThey released a series of 7-inch singles later that autumn while on tour with [[Band of Horses]] and [[King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard]] in the US.

By knowing this Prerna became so embarrassed and ask Anurag to forgive her, and start to work with him. Soon afterward  Komolika is shown to be a deceitful woman whose only interest is in the Basu fortunes. She also has another husband Anurag doesn't know about! Anurag divorces her and she vows to take revenge from both Anurag and Prerna. Mr. Rishabh Bajaj is a rich businessman who is very arrogant and selfish. Prerna and Anurag decides to marry again. Komolika takes over Anurag's property with Bajaj's help. Anurag and his family are left with nothing. Prerna asks Bajaj to return Basu's property as they take over all properties by illegal way. He agrees, but puts a bizarre condition- she will have to marry him(on paper), and promises her that there will no any relation like husband wife or no any intimacy but they just have to pretend husband and wife in front of world only. Prerna marries Bajaj to save Basu\u2019s property. After marriage, she finds out that Bajaj has three children from his ex-wife and the reason why he married Prerna is that he wants someone to look after them. Prerna soon develops affection for his three children, Vishaka, Tushal and Kuki, who is blind. The three children also treat her like their mother. While Prerna is behaving rudely to Bajaj and keep loving Anurag. However bajaj fall for Prerna. Bajaj\u2019s daughter Vishakha fall in love with Anurag and demands to marry her, however Anurag reveals that how illegally Bajaj acquire a Basu\u2019s Property and forces Prerna to marry him, by knowing this Bajaj's children start to hate Bajaj. Now Bajaj\u2019s original wife Menka bose comes in picture, by seeing her bajaj feels insecure because they were not yet divorced, so as per law his marriage with Prerna is illegal. So to sort out the divorce matter with Menka he flied to Australia where he seek divorce from Menka and there he met with an accident, Menka hospitalized him, but declared him as dead, so she can unite Anurag and Prerna. Menka and Bajaj's children ask Anurag and Prerna to marry as they have to overcome that bad sin which was done by bajaj. Prerna marries anurag and the couple stays happily. Meanwhile Komolika comes back and marries Anurag's cousin Shubroto (who is secretly jealous of his older brother). It is also revealed that Bajaj is not dead; his wife Menka keeps this a secret from everyone. He comes back and same as previous like bitter and evil man, still in lust with Prerna. Prerna wants to quit from bajaj\u2019s company where she was worked from even after marriage with Anurag, But Anurag asks her to not quit the job as he believes in her. But bajaj was very evil man he uses this situation to apart Anurag and Prerna, On one company trip to Puna Bajaj makes Prerna unconscious by making her drink with medicine and capture the intimate(like sleeping with each other\u2019s arm) photos with Prerna without her knowledge. Soon after Prerna leaves Bajaj\u2019s office as she knows how bajaj is cruel. However, Prerna still misses her stepchildren and often neglects her family responsibilities to be with them. Bajaj got anoter chance to frame Prerna with using his child. Due to this Anurag become furious when Prerna is not taking care of Prem properly because of bajaj children. Bajaj and Komolika join hands to make part away Anurag and Prerna. One day Bajaj Hire a guy name Mr. Patel and ask him to blackmail Prerna with photos which bajaj used to take in Pune, and also handover this photos to Komolika and ask her to publish this photos in newspaper so Basu family will not believe in Prerna. After seeing this photos Prerna angry on Bajaj and asks him that what\u2019s this all???, but he fooled Prerna and makes her to believe on him, poor Prerna fooled by bajaj. Anurag AND Prerna's  fights reach a new height when Prem is kidnapped and Mr. Bajaj is accused of his kidnapping (the real kidnapper is Mr. Patel who also blackmails Prerna by photos). Anurag and Prerna finally get Prem back. However, he is extremely ill and dies. Prerna, at this point, gets pregnant again but Anurag claims that she cheated on him and says that it is actually not his child. Anurag and Prerna get divorced with each blaming the other for Prem's death(where actually Prerna is responsible for Prem's death, this was revealed to audience).\n\nAnurag now has a new woman in his life, his secretary, Aparna. She is a sweet and innocent woman. His mother hastens to marry Anurag to Aparna. Prerna now lives with Bajaj\u2019s house for the sake of bajaj children and goes to the wedding, where it is revealed that both she and Anurag have feelings for each other. Soon afterwards, Prerna gives birth to a daughter, Sneha. Anurag at first believes that Sneha is his daughter but a faked DNA test proves otherwise and some photographs of Bajaj and Prerna together. Anurag, angry at this, and consummate his relation with his wife  Aparna. It turns out that Komolika and Bajaj switched DNA reports and showed Anurag fake photos told by Bajaj. Prerna goes to the Panchmeshwar with her baby girl.\n \n===First lapse of eight years===\n \nEight years pass, Prerna returns to Mumbai with an eight-year-old Sneha who is the apple of her eye. Precious, cute and funny Sneha goes to school in Mumbai where she meets a girl called Diya. Meanwhile Anurag and Prerna also meet each other but Prerna does not tell him about his daughter. Diya, is in effect, Anurag's niece. Sneha soon goes to the Basu House with Diya where everyone there adores her. As she reveals her name to be Sneha Sharma, nobody guesses her to be Anurag's daughter. Anurag, who is depressed by his son's death has withdrawn into a shell but is soon won over by his daughter who resembles him in many ways. Diya and Sneha go to a summer camp, where parents are allowed, but as neither girls' mother can go, Anurag goes with them. Anurag bonds with Sneha who reminds him both of himself and the love of his life, Prerna. One day, he is shocked to learn that Sneha does not know who her father is. Very soon after that, Sneha misses her mother and wants her to come to the summer camp; Prerna agrees. She is shocked to find Anurag there and even more to see that her daughter knows him very well and adores him. Even Anurag is shocked to find out that the child he has grown to love is actually the proof of his wife's infidelity.\nThey go back to Mumbai where Sneha finds out that her father is Anurag. In an attempt to console her, Prerna says that her father is actually, Bajaj. Hurt by Anurag's rejection, Prerna becomes engaged to Bajaj so that her daughter can have a father.\nSoon she finds out that Sneha has leukemia and the only thing that can cure her is the bone marrow of her full sibling. As Prem is dead and Anurag and Prerna have no other children, Prerna asks Anurag for help. Another DNA test reveals that Anurag is indeed Sneha's father but even his bone marrow is not exact. Now Prerna and Anurag, each committed to another person, have to conceive another child to save the life of their most treasured possession. Aparna convinces Anurag to go back to Prerna and Bajaj does the same to Prerna. Anurag and Prerna spend a night at Panchmeshwar and Prerna gets pregnant. Soon afterwards, Aparna's first husband enters the picture; he helps Aparna kill Anurag on Karwa Chuth night. Prerna is devastated and she sees Anurag everywhere. Aparna, who inherits all of Anurag's property, threatens to throw everyone out. It is soon revealed that Aparna's ex-husband actually saves Anurag's life. Anurag is actually alive. Prerna and Sneha also find out and they keep this a secret from everyone and Anurag appears as a ghost to torture Aparna who finally confesses to a roomful of reporters.\n \nAfter Bajaj finds that Anurag is alive, he thinks Prerna doesn't love him, so he breaks his engagement with her and detaches himself from her. He also tries to be rude to her thinking that if he is rude, she would hate him and can marry anurag and be happy. Later on, Prerna gives birth to a son called Prem. Bajaj gets into a brief relationship with a lawyer called Madhvi- (who is his wife's sister) by thinking she is Prerna. Prerna and Anurag Loves each other a lot but decide to part away by thinking their children\u2019s and they believe that love is not only mean to be spent life together but they can even love more by leaving far from each other. Somehow Anurag convince bajaj and prerna to marry for childrens sake. But after marriage Parena isn\u2019t want to physical with bajaj and she reminds him that they were just friend when they got married and they got marry because of children\u2019s sake.  Komolika gets Anurag's father killed. Prerna gets pregnant again. Anurag's ex-wife has a son-Shravan with Debu. Since Debu dies while saving Anurag, Shravan stays with Anurag.\n \nDuring her godh bahrai (baby blessing) ceremony, Prerna gives the year old Prem to Anurag who by mistake gave Prem to Komalika who kidnapped her. Prerna is livid when she finds out and claims she never wants to see him again. Anurag is very guilty and goes abroad along with Shravan.\n \n===Second lapse of 20 years===\n \n20 years pass and Anurag, who lived in London with Shravan, returns to India. Prerna pretends to be happy in her married life by secretly missing kidnapped Prem and Anurag. Sneha and Kasak are returning from their school with their boy-crazy friend, Tanisha. Here they meet Shravan, a young boy who likes to eat a lot, all four become friends. In Panchmeshwar, Prerna meets Anurag and she is still angry with him. Anurag later on meets his daughter Sneha. Komolika also comes back with a young man claiming to be Prem but is fake. Meanwhile for the youngsters love again sparks up when both Tanisha and Kasak fall for Shravan. Shravan falls in love with Kasak and spends the night with her. Prerna is originally against Kasak's desire to marry Shravan but she reluctantly gives in. However, a few days before the wedding, Shravan finds out about Aparna and believes Prerna killed her. To punish Prerna, he abandons Kasak on the alter and marries Tanisha. Prerna's anger extends when she finds out that Kasak is pregnant. Sneha finds out that Anurag is her father and moves in with him when she fights with Prerna. Kasak miscarries, Shravan is saddened, and Tanisha feels insecure because she knows that he still loves her friend Kasak. She tries to create misunderstandings between Anurag and Shravan.\n \n===Tanisha's father===\n \nMeanwhile Bajaj learns that Tanisha is his daughter with Madhvi. One day Anurag and  Prerna\u2019s Car meet with fatal accident in that Bajaj fell in Coma and Prerna returns with retrograde amnesia and can only remember up to her marriage to Anurag. The doctor tells him that it will be painful to tell her about her son's Prem's death. So they tell her that twenty years have passed and Prerna and Anurag are still married and Prem is alive. While Prerna comes onto Anurag, Anurag resists her for he knows that she is still a married woman. Sampada, Anurag's best friend comes to visit India. She is in love with Anurag and Prerna gets jealous. Aparna returns, Prerna regains her memory but pretends that she still has not to trap Anurag because she has some misunderstanding with Anurag. Anurag admits as such and Prerna sends him to jail, But after that she comes to know that all is done by Aparna and not to Anurag. She madly run towards jail and ask him why he loves her so much and she fails in front of him, she told him that his supreme love towards her will also encourage to her and one day she also reach that level to love him. Prerna accept that always he greatly loves her and always comfort and support her and in return she always hurt him even though she loves him a lot and took vow to release him from jail. Bajaj's brother comes back and he is a lawyer and he, Prerna and Anurag figure out that it was actually Aparna who had caused the accident. Bajaj awakens from coma and a new character makes his entrance, a spoilt brat named Yudi.\nYudi who had been raised by Aparna creates havoc in Prerna's house, first by taking over her orphanage and then by causing Tushar's accident. Prerna and Anurag, then discover that Yudi is actually Prem, their kidnapped son. Prem hates the two but Prerna convinces him to come live with her for thirty days ,Prem agrees and tries his best to be evicted from the house. Meanwhile, Sharad the son of a politician enters Sneha's life. In addition, Mukti, a smart and perky girl, who is Prerna's driver's daughter and had been raised as Prerna's daughter enters the picture. Sneha marries Sharad, and Prerna learns about Tanisha being her husband illegitimate daughter and virtually walks out on him but in then decides to stay by thinking she only marry to bajaj for children\u2019s sake now she can\u2019t back out else children\u2019s future becomes spoils. Prem and Mukti have severe clashes and Prem manages to humiliate Mukti in front of all his friends, Prerna gets extremely angry and throws him out. Aparna is angry as well, because her interest in Yudi was strictly mercenary, and evicts him also. Prem repents his mistake and Prerna, Anurag and Mukti forgive him. Mukti starts falling in love with Prem.\n \n===Prem/Yudi and Mukti===\n \nIn a moment of weakness, Prem and Mukti have it. Prem dismisses it and Mukti is deeply hurt. At a party, Mukti is drugged and brutally raped, her life becomes miserable if she told Prerna that Prem was still after Bajaj's property. However, this was only a misunderstanding, Mukti discovers the rapist is actually her best friend Sneha's husband - Sharad. Although at first no one believes her, Prerna comes to know the truth and support her, and so does Anurag's possible love interest (Sam). With Prerna's support, Mukti files a court case against Sharad, which shocks everyone. Bajaj, Anurag, Sneha and all else are pitted not only against Mukti but also Prerna and the delicate relationships they have are once again tested. Bajaj's brother Manesh is called upon by Bajaj to defend Sharad and during their conversation in private; Sharad reveals to Mahesh that he has indeed raped Mukti.\nMahesh is shocked but feeling that he cannot let Anurag or Sneha know, or the shock might cause great distress, decides that he will aide Sharad. Sharad's father, a powerful politician, who believes Sharad is innocent, uses illegitimate means to dispose of Mukti, including an attempt to kill her. When [Mahesh] learns of this, he approaches Sharad's father and reveals to him that his son is indeed guilty of the crime and if he attempts such an act again, he will not defend Sharad.\nWith this revelation, the attempt to convict Sharad becomes a battle between good and evil with Prerna on one side and Sharad on the other side. In the end, Sharad is proven innocent and released from custody; however, the day of the trial, Sharad's mother has learned the truth that Sharad is guilty. Being that she is a woman, she refuses to let Sharad get away and decides to let everyone know the truth; however Shrad's Dad imprisons her.\nDuring that time, Sneha comes home, opens the door holding Sharad's mom hostage, and learns the truth from her, including the truth about possible evidence of Sharad's confession in Prem's office. She goes to Prem's office and finds the evidence. She then goes to the courthouse and we see her meeting Sharad as he is leaving the courthouse after being announced innocent. She confronts him and he immediately begins to apologize, confessing that he made a mistake. What he doesn't know is that Sneha is secretly taping his confession. When he learns that, he tries to run away, pushing Sneha violently and causing her to miscarry their child. Sharad is once again taken into custody, the truth is revealed to all and the relationship between them and Prerna is improved. After the Sharad storyline, Prem and Mukti have had their differences and despite Prem apologizing to Mukti, she no longer cares for him as she once did. He even proposes to her but she rejects him, which causes him to use any means possible to make her life difficult. During this Prerna learns a secret about Tushar, Bajaj's oldest son.\nTushar has been rejecting any attempts by Bajaj to meet a girl and get married, it is so because he has been secretly married for the past two years to a young British girl by the name of Doris, who was left alone after her mother died and Tushar couldn't turn her away and had to marry her. During this time, it is also noted that someone is trying hard to kill Prerna and Anurag and it is hinted that Aparna might have returned into their lives; however, clues indicate that it not a woman but rather a man who is attempting to kill them or harass them. A new character also has made an entrance, a young girl name Debonita who has come from Calcutta and is living with Anurag. She is slated to be a vamp to replace the popular character played by Komolika. In addition, she showed the audience her true colors when she separated Prem and Mukti (who has now left Prerna's house, heartbroken) and has helped Sharad escape from jail. Prerna convinced Anurag to marry Sampada, and told him that she can\u2019t see him like this she wants to see happy Anurag. On their marriage day Sneha was kidnapped by Sharad and tortured. Sneha in a desperate effort to save herself ends up in getting hold of Sharad's gun. Prerna reaches the spot and witnesses Sneha accidentally shooting Sharad's mom.\nSharad's mom dies and Prerna in order to save Sneha confess to the police that she is the murderer. Anurag overhears Sneha and Prerna's conversation in jail and comes to know the truth. Prerna was sentenced for 14 years imprisonment. Before going to jail Prerna confesses her feeling towards Anurag where she told him that she only loves him in all form where he comes in life, and by hearing this bajaj left in shocked by knowing that Prerna never loved him.\n \n===The next five-year lapse===\n \nAfter the five-year leap, Prerna returns to her house, but her children where living with Anurag and Bajaj was missing. Prem had turned into a villain and he joined Debonita. Prem cheated Bajaj and took all his money. Prerna challenged Prem and there start her next Kasauti.\n \n===Kasautii Against Prem===\n \nSam forced Prerna to stay in Basu house but as days passed due to the increasing friendship of Anurag Prerna, her insecurity also increased. Now there are some usual marital problems going on between Anu-Sam because of Prerna. Mukti's marriage was fixed and Prem had the realization that he loves Mukti. Now Mukti denied to marry Prem, but on her marriage day Prerna asks Mukti to go back to Prem. However, Mukti was killed in a major car accident and Prem ends up in a state where he does not know where he is and what he does. Prem is still living in Mukti's thoughts. Bajaj returns. However, he does not want to come in front of Prerna. The mystery behind this is not yet revealed. A new businessman Omi saves Komolika from Mukti murder case and buys most of the shares of Bajaj's channel in low cost. Now we figure out that Bajaj had left because when he heard Prerna and Anurag's conversation, he came to know that they still loved each other. He felt betrayed by Prerna and left his family. Sneha brings him back to Prerna, and they live together for a children\u2019s sake. Then Prerna figures out that Anurag and Bajaj have secretly been trying to plot out her life for her, not taking her opinion into any consideration.\n\nPrerna decides to cut off all relationships with Bajaj and Anurag, feeling very betrayed. She goes with Prem to Panchmeshwar to get Prem's treatment done. While she is there, she is kidnapped and almost dies until she runs to a fair near by. There, as she is escaping her kidnappers, she sees a girl that looks exactly like Mukti. She finds her, and sees that this is the only way that Prem can be treated back to normal besides electric shock. However, Devki is evil she is a thief who stole money from a bank. Prerna asked Devki to do the same accident when Mukti was killed. Prem was back to normal. After Prem became normal, he wants to marry Mukti. Anurag found out the true nature of Devki but he did not tell anyone because he feared he would lose Prem again.\n \n===Identity crisis===\n \nAfter that, Prem also discovers that Devki is not Mukti. Mukti is dead. However, Sneha and Omi convince him that he has fallen in love with Devki by pretending to fix his marriage. Then at one night Prem and Devki sleep together and the very next day, Devki leaves him. Prem, though devastated, moves on with his life and meets a new character a physiotherapist called Palchin who is helping his grandma. Very soon after that, Shravan and his wife Tanisha, who is expecting a child, are in a car accident for which Prem is held responsible. Suddenly the cast is divided into two sides with Anurag, Prerna, Shravan, Sneha and Kasak supporting Prem while Bajaj along with Sampada, Tushar, Kuki and Vishaka all join Tanisha in her accusation that Prem is responsible for the baby's death.\nMeanwhile, Prem and Tushar have fights over a property and when Prerna chooses Tushar's side, Prem vows to hate her and her husband forever.\nHowever, this is only the beginning of Prerna's troubles, a maharaja comes into her life and he threatens to reveal a secret that only Prerna knows. After much suspense, it is found out that the maharaja had an illegitimate child with Vishaka, Bajaj's oldest daughter. However, Vishaka's daughter, Tanvi, is adopted by her little sister Kuki. And Maharaja wanted her back. However, Prerna manages to ensure that Tanvi stays with her mother.\nMeanwhile Tanisha finds out that she can never be a mother again so her half sister, Kasak agrees to carry her child as a surrogate mother. Sneha is married to Omi, who has fallen genuinely in love with her though his foster aunt Anahita's revenge is far from complete. She arranges for some men to throw acid on Sneha's face but it accidentally falls on Omi's face and no one knows who is responsible. Sneha then takes Omi for treatment abroad while she is pregnant with his child.\nWhile all this is going on, Prem is still hopelessly in love with Devki and Palchin plans her wedding. However, on the day of her wedding, Palchin's fiance runs off and in an attempt to salvage her honor, Prem marries her. Palchin falls in love with her husband while Prem treats her as a friend.\n\nNearly nine months pass, where Prem and Tushar's rivalry escalates. It is revealed (only to the audience) that Kasak deliberately caused Tanisha's miscarriage so that she could carry Shravan's child. There are increasing problems in Anurag and Sampada's marriage regarding Prerna. In addition, Prem was the one who forced Palchin's fiance to leave so that Prem could marry her and inherit a property.\n\nOn Karwa Chuth night, Sampada's insecurities cause her to raise accusations at Anurag and Prerna, while Kasak prepares to fast for Shravan. However, Shravan's ridicules her attempt and tells her that he knew all along that she caused his baby to die and that he hates her. Kasak throws herself at Shravan who loses his temper and hits her and she falls. She is quickly carried to the hospital and Shravan is asked to choose between Kasak and his baby. He chooses the baby and Kasak dies in front of Sampada, Prerna and Bajaj blaming Shravan. Prerna faints and Bajaj runs after Shravan with a gun. Sampada tells Anurag, who runs after Bajaj to stop him, as does Prerna.\n\nOn the Kali Chitti Mountain, Bajaj and Anurag confront each other with guns in their hands while Prerna watches. A gunshot is heard and Bajaj drops dead and the guns falls at Prerna's feet. She grabs the gun and believing Anurag to be Bajaj's killer, shoots him. Meanwhile it is revealed that Sampada killed Bajaj. However, Prerna does not believe it. On the very same night, Prem and Palchin consummate their relationship.\n\nWith the help of Sampada, Prerna is not held responsible legally for the murder of her lover Anurag. However the damage is done, Sampada vows to destroy her husband's killer while Prerna loses all her faith in love. Prem and Shravan hate Prerna for killing their father. The Basu Company collapses without Anurag, and Anurag's mother is hospitalized because she is declared insane.\nPrerna opens a new school in Pamcheswar, 'Rishabh Bajaj Gurukul.' Here she proposes that no child will ever fall in love with again, especially none of her grandchildren.\nDevki comes back in Prerna and Palchin's lives, and she is said to have blood cancer, which explains why she left Prem. Therefore, she leaves to get treatment for cancer.\nSneha gives birth to Omi's child, a girl called Prerna. Tanisha's daughter is called Krutika and is said to be a few hours younger than little Prerna (P2).\nPalchin is revealed to be pregnant.\n \n===After Anurag Basu and Rishabh Bajaj===\n \nNineteen years pass and Prerna has seven grandchildren, three from her biological children and the rest from Tushar and Doris. Then comes Pratam Mittal, a man who threatens to ruin Prerna. He is indeed revealed to be Anurag Basu after extensive plastic surgery. This is known to no one except Prerna and Sampada. While Sam is glad to have her husband back, she is scared that he will find out about her hand in  Bajaj's death. Prerna while appearing to be fighting Pratam's attempts on the outside, now has to fight her old emotions for Anurag, while she tries to destroys his attempts to destroy her family, the way he felt that she destroyed her. After the return of Anurag Basu (Pratam Mittal), things in the Prerna and everyone's life start to change. P2 falls in love with a boy in her school called Saksham, knowing that her grandmother would get mad. P2 is to marry Saksham's older brother Vardhan, but when she comes to know that somebody is blackmailing Dhara, she leaves on the very day of her wedding to find the person. Therefore, the person tells her to meet her in a hotel room. When P2 reaches the guy locks P2 in with him in the hotel room, then Saksham comes and tries to save P2 but she accidentally breaks glass over her his head so then Saksham hands him self over instead of P2. Meanwhile P2 is nowhere to be seen, so Dhara pulls her veil over so nobody could see her, and gets married to Vardhan instead. However, when Vardhan comes to know he gets mad and kicks Dhara out his house. Then Pratam Mittal takes Dhara back to the house and when Prem comes to know he gets mad at Prerna and blames everything on her. Then Sam badmouths about Big P in front of Prem, and Prem starts to hate Prerna even more.\n\nBig P is absolutely furious and is mad at P2 for everything. Then P2 bails out Saksham. Saksham's family accepts Dhara. But Vardhan gets mad leaves in the after party Vardhan is nowhere to be seen but in the middle of the party the blackmailer sends a letter to Saksham saying that he has to go to court for trying to kill him. However, P2 and Saksham still do not tell the real deal. Later everybody finds about P2 and Saksham. Big P gets very angry and then expels Saksham from the house, but then P.M talks to Big P and then P2 and Saksham are all set to get engaged. Saksham takes P2 to his parents house. They are dead but he declares that they were great lovers and P2 is always welcome here. He wants their love to be like his parents'. They go outside and are admiring a waterfall from the top when P2 slips. Saksham saves her and they both succumb to their love and sleep with each other.\nMeanwhile Vardhan meets a girl named Kiran not knowing that she is indeed Dhara his wife but Vardhan still falls in love with her. Nehal comes for Saksham's engagement but Sam creates problems so Prerna is forced to think that Saksham likes P2's sister Jwala but P.M makes everything all right. Then afterwards Saksham gives P2 a call; between their conversation a group of men hired by Sam start to beat him up, luckily P2 goes to Saksham's rescue. P2 is shot instead of Saksham and falls in the lake but Saksham jumps for her knowing that he can't swim. He brings P2 over to the surface, but when he tries to wake her up she doesn't respond, so Saksham drowns himself on purpose. P2 wakes up and realizes that Saksham has drowned.\n \n===Saksham's death===\n \nNehal comes to the scene and takes P2 with her back to her place. When everybody sees P2 they all get worried but Nehal explains everything to them. Nehal hires an investigation team to sort out the puzzle and even though Sam got Saksham killed (because in a way Anurag and Prerna would get back together), all the fake evidence leads towards...Prerna. Prem gets angry and turns back into Yudi. Sneha, Tushar and Yudi kick Prerna out of the house meanwhile Anurag's mom tells him everything about Sam so he goes and tells Prerna everything and Prerna apologize to Anurag for her bad behaviour towards him but Sam threatens to kill Anurag's mom so Prerna gives her house to her in order to save Anurag's mom. When Anurag finds out about the kids kicking Prerna out of the house he gets very angry and starts to talk to the kids but Sam comes in and asks Prerna to stay because the property transfer will take time. Sam starts to take over the house and nobody is happy about this. Nehal comes in the house during the shrarth for Anurag (planned by Sam) and vows to punish Prerna for Saksham's death no matter how big, rich and important she is. He accuses her of stopping her arrest warrant and hiring the biggest lawyer in town, but he will still get her punished. However, Prerna did not do these things and realizes Anurag must have done them. Prerna stops the shrarth by insulting the pandits. Sam uses this to degrade her in front of her children. Meanwhile P2 faints upstairs and the doctor declares that she is pregnant with Saksham's child. Sam goes to Saksham's place and tells his aunt, uncle and Nihaal that P2 is pregnant with someone else's child. Nihaal in anger goes to P2's house and confronts her about this. Then after he yells at her about the child he leaves and after he leaves P2 gets a call from Harsh (the guy that was blackmailing Dhara) and he says he has some pictures of Saksham so she should come and get them but what really is happening is that Nehal and Sampada (Sam) get together to ruin P2's and Prerna's life. So Nehal made a plan with Harsh and Sampada that they will get P2 in the hotel room with Harsh and he will videotape it so it will look like Harsh and P2 are having an affair. Then Prerna knows something bad is going to happen to P2 because Sampada said so but she didn't say what, so Prerna goes and prays to god and hopes nothing bad happens to P2. At that second a thief comes into the hotel and tells Nehal to give him the CD he's holding in his hand and also points a gun at Nehal. The CD that the thief destroyed had P2 and Harsh hugging. Then the thief sees a key in Nehals hand and tells him to open the hotel door and P2 and Harsh are in that room but Harsh quickly escapes and now only P2, Nehal, and the thief are in the room, but Nehal thinks and says that no matter what he has to save P2 or else he could get in trouble so he takes the gun out of the thief's hand and points it at him and takes the thief to the police. When they go outside P2 became scared that she hugged Nehal and wouldn't let go of him, all the press and TV reporters were there, and so everyone thought they were lovers. However, trouble rises everywhere and both the families are upset about all this so they decide that Nehal and P2 should get married. P.M takes everyone to the Basu house where Sam has kept Mohini (Anu/P.M's Mom) but nobody is aware of this fact Mohini tries to call P.M but since she has masking tape on her mouth she is enable to speak but P.M gets worried and checks out all the phones in the house and realizes that there is a secret basement in the house he goes there but nothing is there little does he know that Mohini, Sam and the men she hired are hiding behind the stuff. Sam and the men leave with Mohini in front of Anurag, but he is unable to do anything. Afterwards Prerna and Anurag tie up Sam but have to set her free because since she is the only one who can give her an insulin injection since Mohini has [diabetes]. Meanwhile over at the Garewal Mansion it is Breakfast time and Nehal refuses to eat the food that P2 has made so he sends her in for some food made by the family's cook but little does he know that the food is real spicy when he takes a bite out of it he realizes that it's real spicy so he decides to backfire P2's little plan he tells everybody that he is going to feed P2 with his own hands today. Later P2 is thinking about her time spent with Saksham but Dhara comes in and they start a conversation and tell themselves that they wouldn't let each other know what really goes on between their relationships with their husbands.\n \n===Komolika's return===\n \nSampada and Prerna have a shoot out, only for Sampada to be arrested. After that, Komolika is shown returning to Nihal with some evil ideas...Later after Komolika's return...Meanwhile the Basu-Bajaj Family finds out that Anurag is alive and he is welcomed back with great honor but Dhara and Vardan get stuck in a storm...A women claims that Anurag is her fiance Dhanraj and even gets him kidnapped but Komolika helps them out later Prerna and Anurag find out that the man named Dhanraj is actually a real person. Meanwhile over at the Garewal Mansion, P2 is accused of stealing Komolika's money but Komolika tells every one that she was the one who put it there. After a few hours a celebration is held at the Garewal mansion a traditional way of celebrating a baby's new arrival (for Saksham and P2's unborn child) and Anurag and Prerna are shocked to see Komolika there...Everybody sees Komolika but she acts real nice every body starts to dance and Dhara faints then a family friend tells them that she is pregnant and everybody comes to know the truth.\n \n===Kiran/Dhara Revealed===\n \nThey ask Dhara is it true and she tells everybody about Dhara/Kiran, Vardhan comes back home and refuses to recognize Dhara. Later Nihaal tells Vardhan that Dhara and Kiran are the same people and she is indeed his wife and he gets real upset and plans revenge. Afterwards Komolika is passing by, listens to P2 and Nihaal's conversation, and finds out about how bad their relationship is when P2 leaves, Komolika slaps Nihaal and tells him that just because he hates P2 he shouldn't have ruined her sister's life and her future especially the unborn child's. Komolika refuses to talk to Nihaal and Divyana plans to kill Dhara. Divyana tells Dhara to warm the food (Divyana has cut the gas wire in the kitchen so when Dhara turns the stove on she will be burned and die); P2 tells Dhara that she will warm the food instead. P2 turns on the stove and fire flames are everywhere luckily Nihaal comes to her rescue and saves her. Later in the hospital Prerna comes and blames Komolika for everything but Anurag and Prem tell that she didn't do anything. Afterwards Prerna thanks Nihaal for saving P2's life and he says that it was his duty to save his wife. Everybody leaves and P2 says ouch and Nihaal runs for her but P2 says it was the baby who kicked her for a second Nihaal is happy but then Nihaal gets angry and steps outside. The whole family, especially Prem and Sneha and the mothers of Anurag and Prerna, are excited to see Anurag and Prerna's marriage. Anurag and Prerna get ready to marry, they both are very happy by thinking that finally life gave a chance to marry them. Just before the wedding, Bajaj arrives and it is said that he has lost his memory. Now Whole Family is in grief For Anurag and Prerna but they had no choice for bajaj and accept him. Stress and tension could cause Bajaj to revert to a coma so family decides not to tell him his real idenity. Bajaj stays overnight at the Bajaj mansion and leaves early morning thinking so he wouldn't a burden on Prerna. Anurag brings back RB as always.\n \n===A bond between Nihaal and P2===\n \nNihaal and P2 are now friends. The Basu-Bajaj Family go over to the Garewal mansion for a Pooja (a means to worship different Gods for a purpose), there RB feels a little uncomfortable and decides to sit in the corner and read the newspaper. He realises that his wanted poster hasn't been posted. RB decides to stepout of the Pooja and ask Tushar about it, He reaches the Bajaj mansion and there the servants tell him that Tushar is in the store room (Attic). He goes up to the attic for Tushar(little does he know that he had already left). Rb turns the light on and the plug gives him a little shock and he falls to the ground right in front of Anurag and Prerna who followed him up to the attic.\n \n===Bajaj's scheme===\n \nWhat is up with Bajaj? Blaming Anurag and acting nice as always bajaj follow this same pattern ,and the other woman. He is Bajaj, but all this time he was faking that he lost his memory. He is Dhanraj and Bajaj which all along wants to destroy Prerna and Anurag. Now a lot of questions- Will Bajaj ever know that he misunderstood Anurag and Prerna?

They planned it all to screw Anurag into accepting that he is Dhanraj Kapoor. But Prerna comes to know the bitter truth of Komolika's plan and how she has used Bajaj to carry out her work. Bajaj learns of Komolika's cruel intentions and is deeply angered over the fact that he had trusted her. He threatens Komolika to keep away from his family and his children's lives. Feeling guilty, Bajaj asks for forgiveness from both Anurag and Prerna for hurting them without knowing the truth.\n \n===Rudraksh Basu's arrival===\n \nThe son of Prem and Palchin (actually Prem and Devki) arrives. Tara gets a purposal from a rich and equally respected family and the Basu family accepts it but Rud is kind of uncertain about taking this decision. Meanwhile something is going about with Palchin and giving Rud sleeping tablets.

By knowing this Prerna became so embarrassed and ask Anurag to forgive her, and start to work with him. Soon afterward  Komolika is shown to be a deceitful woman whose only interest is in the Basu fortunes. She also has another husband Anurag doesn't know about! Anurag divorces her and she vows to take revenge from both Anurag and Prerna. Mr. Rishabh Bajaj is a rich businessman who is very arrogant and selfish. Prerna and Anurag decides to marry again. Komolika takes over anurag's property with Bajaj's help. Anurag and his family are left with nothing. Prerna asks Bajaj to return Basu's property as they take over all properties by illegal way. He agrees, but puts a bizarre condition- she will have to marry him(on paper), and promises her that there will no any relation like husband wife or no any intimacy but they just have to pretend husband and wife in front of world only. Prerna marries to bajaj to save Basu\u2019s property. After marriage, she finds out that Bajaj has three children from his ex-wife and the reason why he married Prerna is that he wants someone to look after them. Prerna soon develops affection for his three children, Vishaka, Tushal and Kuki, who is blind. The three children also treat her like their mother. While Prerna is behaving rudely to Bajaj and keep loving Anurag. However bajaj fall for Prerna. Bajaj\u2019s daughter Vishakha fall in love with Anurag and demands to marry her, however Anurag reveals that how illegally bajaj acquire a Basu\u2019s Property and forces Prerna to marry him, by knowing this Bajaj's children start to hate Bajaj. Now Bajaj\u2019s original wife Menka bose comes in picture, by seeing her bajaj gets insecurity because they were not divorced yet, so as per law his marriage with Prerna is illegal. So to sort out the divorce matter with Menka he flied to Australia where he seek divorce from Menka and there he met with an accident, Menka hospitalized him, but declared him as dead, so she can unite Anurag and Prerna. Menka and Bajaj Children ask Anurag and Prerna to marry as they have to overcome that bad sin which was done by bajaj. Prerna marries anurag and the couple stays happily. Meanwhile Komolika comes back and marries Anurag's cousin Shubroto (who is secretly jealous of his older brother). It is also revealed that Bajaj is not dead; his wife Menka keeps this a secret from everyone. He comes back and same as previous like bitter and evil man, still in lust with Prerna. Prerna wants to quit from bajaj\u2019s company where she was worked from even after marriage with Anurag, But Anurag asks her to not quit the job as he believes in her. But bajaj was very evil man he uses this situation to apart Anurag and Prerna, On one company trip to Puna Bajaj makes Prerna unconscious by making her drink with medicine and capture the intimate(like sleeping with each other\u2019s arm) photos with Prerna without her knowledge. Soon after Prerna leaves bajaj\u2019s office as she knows how bajaj is cruel. However, Prerna still misses her stepchildren and often neglects her family responsibilities to be with them. Bajaj got anoter chance to frame Prerna with using his child. Due to this Anurag become furious when Prerna is not taking care of Prem properly because of bajaj children. Bajaj and Komolika join hands to make part away Anurag and Prerna. One day Bajaj Hire a guy name Mr. Patel and ask him to blackmail Prerna with photos which bajaj used to take in Pune, and also handover this photos to Komolika and ask her to publish this photos in newspaper so Basu family will not believe in Prerna. After seeing this photos Prerna angry on Bajaj and asks him that what\u2019s this all???, but he fooled Prerna and makes her to believe on him, poor Prerna fooled by bajaj. Anurag AND Prerna's  fights reach a new height when Prem is kidnapped and Mr. Bajaj is accused of his kidnapping (the real kidnapper is Mr. Patel who also blackmails Prerna by photos). Anurag and Prerna finally get Prem back. However, he is extremely ill and dies. Prerna, at this point, gets pregnant again but Anurag claims that she cheated on him and says that it is actually not his child. Anurag and Prerna get divorced with each blaming the other for Prem's death(where actually Prerna is responsible for Prem's death, this was revealed to audience).\nAnurag now has a new woman in his life, his secretary, Aparna. She is a sweet and innocent woman. His mother hastens to marry Anurag to Aparna. Prerna now lives with Bajaj\u2019s house for the sake of bajaj children and goes to the wedding, where it is revealed that both she and Anurag have feelings for each other. Soon afterwards, Prerna gives birth to a daughter, Sneha. Anurag at first believes that Sneha is his daughter but a faked DNA test proves otherwise and some photographs of Bajaj and Prerna together. Anurag, angry at this, and consummate his relation with his wife  Aparna. It turns out that Komolika and Bajaj switched DNA reports and showed Anurag fake photos told by Bajaj. Prerna goes to the Panchmeshwar with her baby girl.\n \nFirst lapse of 8 years\n \nEight years pass, Prerna returns to Mumbai with an eight-year-old Sneha who is the apple of her eye. Precious, cute and funny Sneha goes to school in Mumbai where she meets a girl called Diya. Meanwhile Anurag and Prerna also meet each other but Prerna does not tell him about his daughter. Diya, is in effect, Anurag's niece. Sneha soon goes to the Basu House with Diya where everyone there adores her. As she reveals her name to be Sneha Sharma, nobody guesses her to be Anurag's daughter. Anurag, who is depressed by his son's death has withdrawn into a shell but is soon won over by his daughter who resembles him in many ways. Diya and Sneha go to a summer camp, where parents are allowed, but as neither girls' mother can go, Anurag goes with them. Anurag bonds with Sneha who reminds him both of himself and the love of his life, Prerna. One day, he is shocked to learn that Sneha does not know who her father is. Very soon after that, Sneha misses her mother and wants her to come to the summer camp; Prerna agrees. She is shocked to find Anurag there and even more to see that her daughter knows him very well and adores him. Even Anurag is shocked to find out that the child he has grown to love is actually the proof of his wife's infidelity.\nThey go back to Mumbai where Sneha finds out that her father is Anurag. In an attempt to console her, Prerna says that her father is actually, Bajaj. Hurt by Anurag's rejection, Prerna becomes engaged to Bajaj so that her daughter can have a father.\nSoon she finds out that Sneha has leukemia and the only thing that can cure her is the bone marrow of her full sibling. As Prem is dead and Anurag and Prerna have no other children, Prerna asks Anurag for help. Another DNA test reveals that Anurag is indeed Sneha's father but even his bone marrow is not exact. Now Prerna and Anurag, each committed to another person, have to conceive another child to save the life of their most treasured possession. Aparna convinces Anurag to go back to Prerna and Bajaj does the same to Prerna. Anurag and Prerna spend a night at Panchmeshwar and Prerna gets pregnant. Soon afterwards, Aparna's first husband enters the picture; he helps Aparna kill Anurag on Karwa Chuth night. Prerna is devastated and she sees Anurag everywhere. Aparna, who inherits all of Anurag's property, threatens to throw everyone out. It is soon revealed that Aparna's ex-husband actually saves Anurag's life. Anurag is actually alive. Prerna and Sneha also find out and they keep this a secret from everyone and Anurag appears as a ghost to torture Aparna who finally confesses to a roomful of reporters.\n \nAfter Bajaj finds that Anurag is alive, he thinks Prerna doesn't love him, so he breaks his engagement with her and detaches himself from her. He also tries to be rude to her thinking that if he is rude, she would hate him and can marry anurag and be happy. Later on, Prerna gives birth to a son called Prem. Bajaj gets into a brief relationship with a lawyer called Madhvi- (who is his wife's sister) by thinking she is Prerna. Prerna and Anurag Loves each other a lot but decide to part away by thinking their children\u2019s and they believe that love is not only mean to be spent life together but they can even love more by leaving far from each other. Somehow Anurag convince bajaj and prerna to marry for childrens sake. But after marriage Parena isn\u2019t want to physical with bajaj and she reminds him that they were just friend when they got married and they got marry because of children\u2019s sake.  Komolika gets Anurag's father killed. Prerna gets pregnant again. Anurag's ex-wife has a son-Shravan with Debu. Since Debu dies while saving Anurag, Shravan stays with Anurag.\n \nDuring her godh bahrai (baby blessing) ceremony, Prerna gives the year old Prem to Anurag who by mistake gave Prem to Komalika who kidnapped her. Prerna is livid when she finds out and claims she never wants to see him again. Anurag is very guilty and goes abroad along with Shravan.\n \nSecond lapse of 20 years\n \n20 years pass by, Anurag, who lived in London with Shravan, comes back to India. Prerna pretends to be happy in her married life by secretly missing kidnapped Prem and Anurag. Sneha and Kasak are returning from their school with their boy-crazy friend, Tanisha. Here they meet Shravan, a young boy who likes to eat a lot, all four become friends. In Panchmeshwar, Prerna meets Anurag and she is still angry with him. Anurag later on meets his daughter Sneha. Komolika also comes back with a young man claiming to be Prem but is fake. Meanwhile for the youngsters love again sparks up when both Tanisha and Kasak fall for Shravan. Shravan falls in love with Kasak and spends the night with her. Prerna is originally against Kasak's desire to marry Shravan but she reluctantly gives in. However, a few days before the wedding, Shravan finds out about Aparna and believes Prerna killed her. To punish Prerna, he abandons Kasak on the alter and marries Tanisha. Prerna's anger extends when she finds out that Kasak is pregnant. Sneha finds out that Anurag is her father and moves in with him when she fights with Prerna. Kasak miscarries, Shravan is saddened, and Tanisha feels insecure because she knows that he still loves her friend Kasak. She tries to create misunderstandings between Anurag and Shravan.\n \nIs Tanisha bajaj's Child????\n \nMeanwhile Bajaj learns that Tanisha is his daughter with Madhvi. One day Anurag and  Prerna\u2019s Car meet with fatal accident in that Bajaj fell in Coma and Prerna returns with retrograde amnesia and can only remember up to her marriage to Anurag. The doctor tells him that it will be painful to tell her about her son's Prem's death. So they tell her that twenty years have passed and Prerna and Anurag are still married and Prem is alive. While Prerna comes onto Anurag, Anurag resists her for he knows that she is still a married woman. Sampada, Anurag's best friend comes to visit India. She is in love with Anurag and Prerna gets jealous. Aparna returns, Prerna regains her memory but pretends that she still has not to trap Anurag because she has some misunderstanding with Anurag. Anurag admits as such and Prerna sends him to jail, But after that she comes to know that all is done by Aparna and not to Anurag. She madly run towards jail and ask him why he loves her so much and she fails in front of him, she told him that his supreme love towards her will also encourage to her and one day she also reach that level to love him. Prerna accept that always he greatly loves her and always comfort and support her and in return she always hurt him even though she loves him a lot and took vow to release him from jail. Bajaj's brother comes back and he is a lawyer and he, Prerna and Anurag figure out that it was actually Aparna who had caused the accident. Bajaj awakens from coma and a new character makes his entrance, a spoilt brat named Yudi.\nYudi who had been raised by Aparna creates havoc in Prerna's house, first by taking over her orphanage and then by causing Tushar's accident. Prerna and Anurag, then discover that Yudi is actually Prem, their kidnapped son. Prem hates the two but Prerna convinces him to come live with her for thirty days ,Prem agrees and tries his best to be evicted from the house. Meanwhile, Sharad the son of a politician enters Sneha's life. In addition, Mukti, a smart and perky girl, who is Prerna's driver's daughter and had been raised as Prerna's daughter enters the picture. Sneha marries Sharad, and Prerna learns about Tanisha being her husband illegitimate daughter and virtually walks out on him but in then decides to stay by thinking she only marry to bajaj for children\u2019s sake now she can\u2019t back out else children\u2019s future becomes spoils. Prem and Mukti have severe clashes and Prem manages to humiliate Mukti in front of all his friends, Prerna gets extremely angry and throws him out. Aparna is angry as well, because her interest in Yudi was strictly mercenary, and evicts him also. Prem repents his mistake and Prerna, Anurag and Mukti forgive him. Mukti starts falling in love with Prem.\n \nPrem/Yudi and Mukti\n \nIn a moment of weakness, Prem and Mukti have it. Prem dismisses it and Mukti is deeply hurt. At a party, Mukti is drugged and brutally raped, her life becomes miserable if she told Prerna that Prem was still after Bajaj's property. However, this was only a misunderstanding, Mukti discovers the rapist is actually her best friend Sneha's husband - Sharad. Although at first no one believes her, Prerna comes to know the truth and support her, and so does Anurag's possible love interest (Sam). With Prerna's support, Mukti files a court case against Sharad, which shocks everyone. Bajaj, Anurag, Sneha and all else are pitted not only against Mukti but also Prerna and the delicate relationships they have are once again tested. Bajaj's brother [Mahesh]is called on by Bajaj to defend Sharad and during their conversation in private; Sharad reveals to Mahesh that he has indeed raped Mukti.\nMahesh is shocked but feeling that he cannot let Anurag or Sneha know, or the shock might cause great distress, decides that he will aide Sharad. Sharad's father, a powerful politician, who believes Sharad is innocent, uses illegitimate means to dispose of Mukti, including an attempt to kill her. When [Mahesh] learns of this, he approaches Sharad's father and reveals to him that his son is indeed guilty of the crime and if he attempts such an act again, he will not defend Sharad.\nWith this revelation, the attempt to convict Sharad becomes a battle between good and evil with Prerna on one side and Sharad on the other side. In the end, Sharad is proven innocent and released from custody; however, the day of the trial, Sharad's mother has learned the truth that Sharad is guilty. Being that she is a woman, she refuses to let Sharad get away and decides to let everyone know the truth; however Shrad's Dad imprisons her.\nDuring that time, Sneha comes home, opens the door holding Sharad's mom hostage, and learns the truth from her, including the truth about possible evidence of Sharad's confession in Prem's office. She goes to Prem's office and finds the evidence. She then goes to the courthouse and we see her meeting Sharad as he is leaving the courthouse after being announced innocent. She confronts him and he immediately begins to apologize, confessing that he made a mistake. What he doesn't know is that Sneha is secretly taping his confession. When he learns that, he tries to run away, pushing Sneha violently and causing her to miscarry their child. Sharad is once again taken into custody, the truth is revealed to all and the relationship between them and Prerna is improved. After the Sharad storyline, Prem and Mukti have had their differences and despite Prem apologizing to Mukti, she no longer cares for him as she once did. He even proposes to her but she rejects him, which causes him to use any means possible to make her life difficult. During this Prerna learns a secret about Tushar, Bajaj's oldest son.\nTushar has been rejecting any attempts by Bajaj to meet a girl and get married, it is so because he has been secretly married for the past two years to a young British girl by the name of Doris, who was left alone after her mother died and Tushar couldn't turn her away and had to marry her. During this time, it is also noted that someone is trying hard to kill Prerna and Anurag and it is hinted that Aparna might have returned into their lives; however, clues indicate that it not a woman but rather a man who is attempting to kill them or harass them. A new character also has made an entrance, a young girl name Debonita who has come from Calcutta and is living with Anurag. She is slated to be a vamp to replace the popular character played by Komolika. In addition, she showed the audience her true colors when she separated Prem and Mukti (who has now left Prerna's house, heartbroken) and has helped Sharad escape from jail. Prerna convinced Anurag to marry Sampada, and told him that she can\u2019t see him like this she wants to see happy Anurag. On their marriage day Sneha was kidnapped by Sharad and tortured. Sneha in a desperate effort to save herself ends up in getting hold of Sharad's gun. Prerna reaches the spot and witnesses Sneha accidentally shooting Sharad's mom.\nSharad's mom dies and Prerna in order to save Sneha confess to the police that she is the murderer. Anurag overhears Sneha and Prerna's conversation in jail and comes to know the truth. Prerna was sentenced for 14 years imprisonment. Before going to jail Prerna confesses her feeling towards Anurag where she told him that she only loves him in all form where he comes in life, and by hearing this bajaj left in shocked by knowing that Prerna never loved him.\n \nNext 5 year lapse\n \nAfter the 5 year leap, Prerna returns to her house, but her children where living with Anurag and Bajaj was missing. Prem had turned into a villain and he joined Debonita. Prem cheated Bajaj and took all his money. Prerna challenged Prem and there start her next Kasauti.\n \nKasautii Against Prem\n \nSam forced Prerna to stay in Basu house but as days passed due to the increasing friendship of Anurag Prerna, her insecurity also increased. Now there are some usual marital problems going on between Anu-Sam because of Prerna. Mukti's marriage was fixed and Prem had the realization that he loves Mukti. Now Mukti denied to marry Prem, but on her marriage day Prerna asks Mukti to go back to Prem. However, Mukti was killed in a major car accident and Prem ends up in a state where he does not know where he is and what he does. Prem is still living in Mukti's thoughts. Bajaj returns. However, he does not want to come in front of Prerna. The mystery behind this is not yet revealed. A new businessman Omi saves Komolika from Mukti murder case and buys most of the shares of Bajaj's channel in low cost. Now we figure out that Bajaj had left because when he heard Prerna and Anurag's conversation, he came to know that they still loved each other. He felt betrayed by Prerna and left his family. Sneha brings him back to Prerna, and they live together for a children\u2019s sake. Then Prerna figures out that Anurag and Bajaj have secretly been trying to plot out her life for her, not taking her opinion into any consideration.\nPrerna decides to cut off all relationships with Bajaj and Anurag, feeling very betrayed. She goes with Prem to Panchmeshwar to get Prem's treatment done. While she is there, she is kidnapped and almost dies until she runs to a fair near by. There, as she is escaping her kidnappers, she sees a girl that looks exactly like Mukti. She finds her, and sees that this is the only way that Prem can be treated back to normal besides electric shock. However, Devki is evil she is a thief who stole money from a bank. Prerna asked Devki to do the same accident when Mukti was killed. Prem was back to normal. After Prem became normal, he wants to marry Mukti. Anurag found out the true nature of Devki but he did not tell anyone because he feared he would lose Prem again.\n \nWho is who?\n \nAfter that, Prem also discovers that Devki is not Mukti. Mukti is dead. However, Sneha and Omi convince him that he has fallen in love with Devki by pretending to fix his marriage. Then at one night Prem and Devki sleep together and the very next day, Devki leaves him. Prem, though devastated, moves on with his life and meets a new character a physiotherapist called Palchin who is helping his grandma. Very soon after that, Shravan and his wife Tanisha, who is expecting a child, are in a car accident for which Prem is held responsible. Suddenly the cast is divided into two sides with Anurag, Prerna, Shravan, Sneha and Kasak supporting Prem while Bajaj along with Sampada, Tushar, Kuki and Vishaka all join Tanisha in her accusation that Prem is responsible for the baby's death.\nMeanwhile, Prem and Tushar have fights over a property and when Prerna chooses Tushar's side, Prem vows to hate her and her husband forever.\nHowever, this is only the beginning of Prerna's troubles, a maharaja comes into her life and he threatens to reveal a secret that only Prerna knows. After much suspense, it is found out that the maharaja had an illegitimate child with Vishaka, Bajaj's oldest daughter. However, Vishaka's daughter, Tanvi, is adopted by her little sister Kuki. And Maharaja wanted her back. However, Prerna manages to ensure that Tanvi stays with her mother.\nMeanwhile Tanisha finds out that she can never be a mother again so her half sister, Kasak agrees to carry her child as a surrogate mother. Sneha is married to Omi, who has fallen genuinely in love with her though his foster aunt Anahita's revenge is far from complete. She arranges for some men to throw acid on Sneha's face but it accidentally falls on Omi's face and no one knows who is responsible. Sneha then takes Omi for treatment abroad while she is pregnant with his child.\nWhile all this is going on, Prem is still hopelessly in love with Devki and Palchin plans her wedding. However, on the day of her wedding, Palchin's fiance runs off and in an attempt to salvage her honor, Prem marries her. Palchin falls in love with her husband while Prem treats her as a friend.\nNearly nine months pass, where Prem and Tushar's rivalry escalates. It is revealed (only to the audience) that Kasak deliberately caused Tanisha's miscarriage so that she could carry Shravan's child. There are increasing problems in Anurag and Sampada's marriage regarding Prerna.

After the return of Anurag Basu (Pratam Mittal), things in the Prerna and everyone's life start to change. P2 falls in love with a boy in her school called Saksham, knowing that her grandmother would get mad. P2 is to get married to Saksham's older brother Vardhan, but when she comes to know that somebody is blackmailing Dhara, she leaves on the very day of her wedding to find the person. Therefore, the person tells her to meet her in a hotel room. When P2 reaches the guy locks P2 in with him in the hotel room, then Saksham comes and tries to save P2 but she accidentally breaks glass over her his head so then Saksham hands him self over instead of P2. Meanwhile P2 is nowhere to be seen, so Dhara pulls her veil over so nobody could see her, and gets married to Vardhan instead. However, when Vardhan comes to know he gets mad and kicks Dhara out his house. Then Pratam Mittal takes Dhara back to the house and when Prem comes to know he gets mad at Prerna and blames everything on her. Then Sam badmouths about Big P in front of Prem, and Prem starts to hate Prerna even more.\nBig P is absolutely furious and is mad at P2 for everything. Then P2 bails out Saksham. Saksham's family accepts Dhara. But Vardhan gets mad leaves in the after party Vardhan is nowhere to be seen but in the middle of the party the blackmailer sends a letter to Saksham saying that he has to go to court for trying to kill him. However, P2 and Saksham still do not tell the real deal. Later everybody finds about P2 and Saksham. Big P gets very angry and then expels Saksham from the house, but then P.M talks to Big P and then P2 and Saksham are all set to get engaged. Saksham takes P2 to his parents house. They are dead but he declares that they were great lovers and P2 is always welcome here. He wants their love to be like his parents'. They go outside and are admiring a waterfall from the top when P2 slips. Saksham saves her and they both succumb to their love and sleep with each other.\nMeanwhile Vardhan meets a girl named Kiran not knowing that she is indeed Dhara his wife but Vardhan still falls in love with her. Nehal comes for Saksham's engagement but Sam creates problems so Prerna is forced to think that Saksham likes P2's sister Jwala but P.M makes everything all right. Then afterwards Saksham gives P2 a call; between their conversation a group of men hired by Sam start to beat him up, luckily P2 goes to Saksham's rescue. P2 is shot instead of Saksham and falls in the lake but Saksham jumps for her knowing that he can't swim. He brings P2 over to the surface, but when he tries to wake her up she doesn't respond, so Saksham drowns himself on purpose. P2 wakes up and realizes that Saksham has drowned.\n \nSaksham's death\n \nNehal comes to the scene and takes P2 with her back to her place. When everybody sees P2 they all get worried but Nehal explains everything to them. Nehal hires an investigation team to sort out the puzzle and even though Sam got Saksham killed (because in a way Anurag and Prerna would get back together), all the fake evidence leads towards...Prerna. Prem gets angry and turns back into Yudi. Sneha, Tushar and Yudi kick Prerna out of the house meanwhile Anurag's mom tells him everything about Sam so he goes and tells Prerna everything and Prerna apologize to Anurag for her bad behaviour towards him but Sam threatens to kill Anurag's mom so Prerna gives her house to her in order to save Anurag's mom. When Anurag finds out about the kids kicking Prerna out of the house he gets very angry and starts to talk to the kids but Sam comes in and asks Prerna to stay because the property transfer will take time. Sam starts to take over the house and nobody is happy about this. Nehal comes in the house during the shrarth for Anurag (planned by Sam) and vows to punish Prerna for Saksham's death no matter how big, rich and important she is. He accuses her of stopping her arrest warrant and hiring the biggest lawyer in town, but he will still get her punished. However, Prerna did not do these things and realizes Anurag must have done them. Prerna stops the shrarth by insulting the pandits. Sam uses this to degrade her in front of her children. Meanwhile P2 faints upstairs and the doctor declares that she is pregnant with Saksham's child. Sam goes to Saksham's place and tells his aunt, uncle and Nihaal that P2 is pregnant with someone else's child. Nihaal in anger goes to P2's house and confronts her about this. Then after he yells at her about the child he leaves and after he leaves P2 gets a call from Harsh (the guy that was blackmailing Dhara) and he says he has some pictures of Saksham so she should come and get them but what really is happening is that Nehal and Sampada (Sam) get together to ruin P2's and Prerna's life. So Nehal made a plan with Harsh and Sampada that they will get P2 in the hotel room with Harsh and he will videotape it so it will look like Harsh and P2 are having an affair. Then Prerna knows something bad is going to happen to P2 because Sampada said so but she didn't say what, so Prerna goes and prays to god and hopes nothing bad happens to P2. At that second a thief comes into the hotel and tells Nehal to give him the CD he's holding in his hand and also points a gun at Nehal. The CD that the thief destroyed had P2 and Harsh hugging. Then the thief sees a key in Nehals hand and tells him to open the hotel door and P2 and Harsh are in that room but Harsh quickly escapes and now only P2, Nehal, and the thief are in the room, but Nehal thinks and says that no matter what he has to save P2 or else he could get in trouble so he takes the gun out of the thief's hand and points it at him and takes the thief to the police. When they go outside P2 became scared that she hugged Nehal and wouldn't let go of him, all the press and TV reporters were there, and so everyone thought they were lovers. However, trouble rises everywhere and both the families are upset about all this so they decide that Nehal and P2 should get married. P.M takes everyone to the Basu house where Sam has kept Mohini (Anu/P.M's Mom) but nobody is aware of this fact Mohini tries to call P.M but since she has masking tape on her mouth she is enable to speak but P.M gets worried and checks out all the phones in the house and realizes that there is a secret basement in the house he goes there but nothing is there little does he know that Mohini, Sam and the men she hired are hiding behind the stuff. Sam and the men leave with Mohini in front of Anurag, but he is unable to do anything. Afterwards Prerna and Anurag tie up Sam but have to set her free because since she is the only one who can give her an insulin injection since Mohini has [diabetes]. Meanwhile over at the Garewal Mansion it is Breakfast time and Nehal refuses to eat the food that P2 has made so he sends her in for some food made by the family's cook but little does he know that the food is real spicy when he takes a bite out of it he realizes that it's real spicy so he decides to backfire P2's little plan he tells everybody that he is going to feed P2 with his own hands today. Later P2 is thinking about her time spent with Saksham but Dhara comes in and they start a conversation and tell themselves that they wouldn't let each other know what really goes on between their relationships with their husbands.\n \nKomolika's return again!\n \nSampada and Prerna have a shoot out, only for Sampada to be arrested. After that, Komolika is shown returning to Nihal with some evil ideas...Later after Komolika's return...Meanwhile the Basu-Bajaj Family finds out that Anurag is alive and he is welcomed back with great honor but Dhara and Vardan get stuck in a storm...A women claims that Anurag is her fiance Dhanraj and even gets him kidnapped but Komolika helps them out later Prerna and Anurag find out that the man named Dhanraj is actually a real person. Meanwhile over at the Garewal Mansion, P2 is accused of stealing Komolika's money but Komolika tells every one that she was the one who put it there. After a few hours a celebration is held at the Garewal mansion a traditional way of celebrating a baby's new arrival (for Saksham and P2's unborn child) and Anurag and Prerna are shocked to see Komolika there...Everybody sees Komolika but she acts real nice every body starts to dance and Dhara faints then a family friend tells them that she is pregnant and everybody comes to know the truth.\n \nKiran/Dhara Revealed\n \nThey ask Dhara is it true and she tells everybody about Dhara/Kiran, Vardhan comes back home and refuses to recognize Dhara. Later Nihaal tells Vardhan that Dhara and Kiran are the same people and she is indeed his wife and he gets real upset and plans revenge. Afterwards Komolika is passing by, listens to P2 and Nihaal's conversation, and finds out about how bad their relationship is when P2 leaves, Komolika slaps Nihaal and tells him that just because he hates P2 he shouldn't have ruined her sister's life and her future especially the unborn child's. Komolika refuses to talk to Nihaal and Divyana plans to kill Dhara. Divyana tells Dhara to warm the food (Divyana has cut the gas wire in the kitchen so when Dhara turns the stove on she will be burned and die); P2 tells Dhara that she will warm the food instead. P2 turns on the stove and fire flames are everywhere luckily Nihaal comes to her rescue and saves her. Later in the hospital Prerna comes and blames Komolika for everything but Anurag and Prem tell that she didn't do anything. Afterwards Prerna thanks Nihaal for saving P2's life and he says that it was his duty to save his wife. Everybody leaves and P2 says ouch and Nihaal runs for her but P2 says it was the baby who kicked her for a second Nihaal is happy but then Nihaal gets angry and steps outside.

The company followed the [[Portuguese East India Company|Portuguese]], [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], [[Danish East India Company|Danish]], [[French East India Company|French]] and [[East India Company|English]] East India Companies.

According to writer Bj\u00f6rn Ahlander, it only took about one and a half years to build a ship of this size in the 1700s. It was built in the Swedish capital and named ''G\u00f6theborg'' because the Swedish East India Company resided in Gothenburg, and all expeditions began and ended at this port. The ship had a [[tonnage]] equivalent to about {{convert|830|MT|lb|abbr=on}}. On its maiden voyage in 1739, the ship carried 30 cannons and an initial crew of 144.{{sfn|Ahlander|Langert|2009}}\n\nThe ship made three journeys to China and in 1745, it sank on its way into Gothenburg harbor. After 30 months at sea, and with only {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}} to go before the vessel reached its berth, it crashed into the Knipla B\u00f6r\u00f6, a well known rock. Although it remains a mystery how this could happen theories abound. The ship remained stranded on the rock while much of the cargo, consisting of tea, porcelain, spices and silk was salvaged. The ship was clearly visible above the surface of the water for many years, but in time the remains sank to the bottom.{{sfn|Ahlander|Langert|2009}}{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|pp=54\u201357}}\n\n=== Sinking ===\n{{Infobox archaeological_site\n  |name = Ostindieb\u00e5darna\n  |caption = Shipwreck location of the original ship\n  |map_type = Sweden V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland\n  |coordinates = {{coord|57.775003|11.758331|format=dms}}\n  |map_size = \n  |location = [[Gothenburg]]\n  |region = \n  |excavations = 1986\u20131992\n  |archaeologists = ''Marinarkeologiska S\u00e4llskapet, G\u00f6teborgskretsen''\n}}\n\nIt is still unclear what caused the ship to run aground due to the scarcity of contemporary written sources. The ''G\u00f6theborg'' had a very experienced [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] on board, Caspar Matthisson (1712\u20131783) from [[Br\u00e4nn\u00f6]], who had been a pilot for seven and a half years at the time of the accident. Even so, the ship suddenly ran aground, or crashed into, the underwater rock the ''Hunneb\u00e5dan''\u2014in the 18th century known as the ''Knipla B\u00f6r\u00f6'' and later the ''G\u00f6theborgs-grundet'' (\"the G\u00f6theborg's rock\") or the ''Ostindieb\u00e5darna'' (\"the East India shallow\").<ref>{{cite journal|last1=L\u00f6\u00f6f|first1=LarsOlof|title=Ostindiefararen G\u00f6theborg: f\u00f6rlisningen vid Nya \u00c4lvsborg och omst\u00e4ndigheterna kring olyckan|journal=G\u00f6teborg f\u00f6rr och nu|date=1998|editor=G\u00f6teborgs hembygdsf\u00f6rbund, 1960-|volume=1998 |issue=27|pages=45\u201358|url=http://libris.kb.se/export.jsp?type=showrecord&q=onr%3a2502879&id=2502879&d=libris&posts=1|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation | Excerpt from a contemporary transcript of Captain Eric Mor\u00e9en's ship's protest, 19{{nbsp}}September 1745:\n:...the impact was so hard that the front of the ship, which had struck the rock, was lifted {{convert|4.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} out of the water, and as the side had been holed, the ship soon began to take in a lot of water; it could be seen from the pump's water-level gauge that the water was 20, 30 and within a few minutes {{convert|60|in|m|abbr=on}} deep inside the ship. The danger was announced with cannon shots and normal signals...{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=55}}}}\n\nThe joint statement by captain Eric Mor\u00e9en and the crew to the ''G\u00f6teborgs R\u00e5dhusr\u00e4tt'' (\"the Municipal Court of Gothenburg\") on the 19{{nbsp}}September 1745 states that the weather on 12{{nbsp}}September was fair and clear, the wind amenable and blowing from south-west or west-southwest. These were ideal conditions since the wind would be coming almost straight from aft. Crossing the ''Riv\u00f6fjorden'' the ship met with the current from the northern part of [[G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv]], ''Nordre \u00e4lv''. Navigation and sailing seems to have been correct up until the time of the accident. Sailing at a speed of {{convert|3|kn|mph|abbr=on}} the ship suddenly veered to [[Port and starboard|starboard]] and hit the rock. The cause may have been a now almost forgotten [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] phenomenon called [[dead water]].{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=57}}\n\nHydrographic conditions at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv in September 1745, are well known. The discharge of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv was unusually large due to heavy snowfall during the winter of 1744\u201345. The water level of Lake [[V\u00e4nern]] was also extremely high in 1745. These factors combined into an increase in the volume of fresh water flowing into the ''\u00c4lvsborgsfjorden'', affecting the layers of fresh and salt water, making the conditions for dead water very favorable on 12{{nbsp}}September 1745.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lundh|first1=Valde|title=Varf\u00f6r gick skeppet G\u00f6theborg p\u00e5 grund h\u00f6sten 1745?|journal=Unda maris|date=2004|volume=2001/2003|pages=106\u2013122|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/9971760|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> It may be that the ''G\u00f6theborg'' was suddenly trapped by dead water when making its final change of course, causing the ship to lose rudder function, go off course and run aground.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=57}}\n\n=== Excavation ===\n[[File:Orignalitems.JPG|thumb|Items recovered from original ship.]]\nIn 9{{nbsp}}December 1984, five members from the ''Marinarkeologiska S\u00e4llskapet, G\u00f6teborgskretsen'' (MASG) (\"the Marine Archeological Society of Gothenburg\") dove at the Hunneb\u00e5dan, the site of the shipwreck.

At the same time the ''East Indiaman G\u00f6theborg Foundation'' (the first foundation) was established, marking the beginning of one of Sweden's most comprehensive [[Maritime archaeology|marine archeological]] surveys at the time. The purpose of the excavation was, among others, to use the wreck of the ''G\u00f6theborg'' as base for spreading knowledge about the history of Gothenburg and the significance of the Swedish East India Company during the 1700s.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|pp=62\u201364}}\n\n[[File:Porslinssk\u00e4rvor fr\u00e5n G\u00f6theborg.jpg|thumb|left|Porcelain items found during the excavation]]\nThe excavations were carried out during the summers 1986\u20131992. The seabed was first investigated using sub-bottom and side scan sonar. Secondly the divers went over the site with metal detectors and probes. To facilitate the excavations, the search area, measuring {{convert|26|by|36|m|abbr=on}}, was divided into a grid system comprising boxes measuring {{convert|2|by|2|m|abbr=on}}. The divers also had two giant suction devices, which sucked up sludge and clay into large sieves, where the smallest finds could be sorted. The remains of the cargo and the ship had settled during the years, together with fine clay, into a {{convert|30|to|40|cm|abbr=on}} thick carpet, hard to penetrate. A total of 5,750 finds were registered during the excavation. Most of it was porcelain, blue and white, blue and white with brown glaze, and multicolored made to order. In addition to this the finds also consisted of tea, [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] shells, [[galangal]], pepper, silk fabric, ingots of \"tutanego\" (these contained 99% zinc, 0,5% iron) not to be confused with [[Nickel silver|paktong]], cannonballs, lead shots, [[rapier]] handles, sword hilts, rigging material and objects belonging to the officers and crew. When compared to the Company's cargo list, which had been preserved, the finds from the excavation made up almost 10 per cent of the original cargo.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nDuring the excavations the thought of building a replica of the ''G\u00f6theborg'' started to form among the divers who had found the ship. The decision to excavate and rebuild the ship has generated large interest over the years from researchers, volunteers, professionals, sponsors and the public. Knowledge about 18th century history, trade with China and the Swedish East India Company has thereby increased substantially.{{sfn|Ahlander|Langert|2009}}\n\n== ''G\u00f6theborg'' revived ==\n[[File:Ostindiefararen G\u00f6theborg den 19 december 2004..JPG|thumb|Building the ''G\u00f6theborg'' at Eriksbergs 19{{nbsp}}December 2004.]]\nWhen the wreckage of the vessel ''G\u00f6theborg'' was found in 1984, the idea to make a replica of the vessel emerged. The [[keel]] for the replica was laid on 11{{nbsp}}June 1995. This was done at the disused [[Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad|Eriksbergs]] wharf by the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv in Gothenburg. Led by Master of Ceremonies Anders W\u00e4stfeldt, two silver coins, one from 1745, and one from 1995, were placed in the halved joints of the {{convert|33|m|ft|abbr=on}} long keel. About 3,000 people attended the forging of the keel, including S\u00f6ren Gyll, director of [[Volvo]] and professor Jorgen Weibull. The project was blessed by the vicar Alf \u00d6sterholm.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Svenska Ostindiska Companiet AB|title=Projektbeskrivning oktober 1996.|journal=Ostindiefararen G\u00f6theborg III|date=1996|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe construction and historical design of the ship was made by Joakim Severinsson. The blueprints for the ship was approved by international [[classification society]] [[Det Norske Veritas]] in November 1995.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Svenska Ostindiska Companiet AB|title=Projektbeskrivning oktober 1996.|journal=Ostindiefararen G\u00f6theborg III|date=1996|page=8}}</ref> All that was left of the Eriksbergs wharf were two-thirds of building berth number six, the large gantry crane and the dry dock. Around this, a new shipyard for building the ''G\u00f6theborg'' began to grow. A new ship's hall was built over the building berth, a timber workshop, a forge, a rigging workshop with a sail loft and some modern facilities such as a restaurant, offices and conference rooms were also added to the site. Since the wharf was built on reclaimed land, it seemed very apt to call it Terra Nova (\"new land\" in Latin) just like the wharf where the original vessel had been built.{{sfn|Ahlander|Langert|2009}}{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe vessel was built using old, traditional techniques, and it was made as close to the original as possible.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=13}} One small change was that the headroom of the deck was increased by 10&nbsp;cm, since today's seamen are taller than their ancestors.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=84}}\n\nWhile the exterior remains true to the original, the interior is highly modern. The ship has an electrical system and [[propeller]]s powered by [[diesel engine]]s. The engines were only intended for port navigation and emergency situations, but they have been used during unfavourable wind in order to keep the timetable for the journey to China. Other enhancements include [[satellite navigation]], communications equipment, modern facilities for the crew (kitchen, lavatories, washing machines, [[desalination]] equipment, ventilation, refrigerators), watertight [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] and fire protection (fire sprinkler systems, fire hydrants etc.). Most of this new technology was necessary to pass national and international safety regulations.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe vessel was launched on 6{{nbsp}}June 2003, with great festivities and in the presence of representatives from the [[Swedish Royal Family]].{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=96}}\n\nTen tons of hemp ropes were used for rigging the vessel, together with some 1,000 blocks and {{convert|1,964|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} linen sail. All this was produced using 18th century techniques. The first trial under sail began on 18{{nbsp}}April 2005.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|pp=86\u201387}}\n\n=== Financing ===\nAt its completion in 2005, the project had cost about 250 million SEK (almost $40 million), some 40% from public funds and the rest from sponsors.<ref name=Svd250>{{cite web|last1=Hansson|first1=Matilda|title=Ostindiefararen anl\u00f6per Stockholm|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/ostindiefararen-anloper-stockholm_448255.svd|website=www.svd.se|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the years the ship has been in the care of two foundations. The first foundation consisted of [[Volvo]], [[SKF]], [[Stena Line]] and the [[Port of Gothenburg]] among others. This foundation financed the ship up until the end of the journey to China and in 2010, its economical commitment ended. The second foundation, a non-profitable foundation, for the ship was created shortly afterwards. The business is operated by The Swedish East India Company Ltd. In January 2011, questions were raised about the future of the ship. The [[Gothenburg Municipality]] was willing to pay for the ongoing maintenance of the ship if sponsors made contributions for the expeditions and other activities. An immediate liquidation of the operation and turning the ship into a museum was also suggested.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bozinovska|first1=Snezana|title=F\u00e4rdigseglat f\u00f6r Ostindiefararen?|url=http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.532498-fardigseglat-for-ostindiefararen-|website=www.gp.se|publisher=G\u00f6teborgs-Posten|accessdate=9 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119202146/http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.532498-fardigseglat-for-ostindiefararen-|archive-date=19 January 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In February 2011, the future plans for the ship were postponed by the [[V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland Regional Council]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Losman|first1=Birgitta|title=Pressmeddelande|url=http://nyheter.vgregion.se/sv/Nyheter/Regionutveckling/Pressarkiv/Rubrik/|website=www.vgregion.se|publisher=[[V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland Regional Council]]|accessdate=9 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714152419/http://nyheter.vgregion.se/sv/Nyheter/Regionutveckling/Pressarkiv/Rubrik/|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, the Greencarrier Group announced they would be supporting and funding ''G\u00f6theborg's'' future sailing ventures.<ref>https://greencarrier.com/press-release/we-are-very-pleased-to-announce-that-greencarrier-is-enabling-the-ship-gotheborg-to-sail-again/</ref> There are plans for the ship to sail to several different ports around the world, as well as taking part in different sailing events.

It is a replica of the ''G\u00f6theborg I'' which sank outside Gothenburg in 1745. A second ship the ''G\u00f6theborg II'' was built in Gothenburg in 1786. It was the largest{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=18}} of all the SOIC vessels and it made three journeys to Canton: 2{{nbsp}}February 1788\u201313{{nbsp}}May 1790, 13{{nbsp}}November 1791\u201312{{nbsp}}June 1793, and on 5{{nbsp}}December 1795, the ship sailed for Canton but was lost at [[Cape Town]] on 8{{nbsp}}March 1796, on the way out from Gothenburg.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=182\u2013183}}\n\n=== Crew ===\nWhen leaving its home port the original ship could have over 130 crew members. This number of hands was necessary since many of the sailors died from diseases or disappeared during storms. Even though it was a high risk job under difficult conditions, the company did not have any problems recruiting sailors for these well paid jobs. Many of the recruits were poor young men, sons of farmers, seeking opportunity to become wealthy. The replica has a crew of 80 sailors.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=99}}\n\n=== Flag ===\n[[File:Vshaped flag.JPG|thumb|The swallowtailed SOIC flag.]]\nThe East Indiaman ''G\u00f6theborg'' is classified as a passenger ship sailing under the ordinary Swedish flag. But when in port, the ship is entitled to fly the old swallowtailed version of the flag, the SOIC flag (''Svenska Ostindiska Companiet'', \"Swedish East India Company\"), that the original vessel sailed under.<ref>{{cite journal|title=no title|journal=[[G\u00f6teborgs-Posten]]|date=6 October 2005|page=10}}</ref>\n\nThe flag used on Swedish boats is the ordinary, rectangular flag. Swedish warships, or ships carrying a military commander, fly the Swedish [[ensign]] a triple-tailed or swallowtail and tongue version of the rectangular flag. The Swedish East India Company displayed a fork-tailed or swallow-tailed flag on their ships. The intention was that the ship should resemble a warship and thereby not attract pirates. This was against the rules and regulations for flags at that time. The use of the swallowtail was prohibited in a royal decree in 1751, but the SOIC ignored this and ordered their flags in Canton instead.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=174\u2013175}} In a memorandum to the [[Riksdag]] in 2012, a proposition was made to a grant dispensation from the prohibition.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Utbult|first1=Roland|title=Motion 2012/13:K205 Tv\u00e5tungad flagga f\u00f6r fritidsb\u00e5tar|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Forslag/Motioner/mot-201213K205-Tvatungad-fla_H002K205/?text=true|website=www.riksdagen.se|publisher=[[Riksdag|Sveriges Riksdag]]|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> The proposition was declined and the decree is still in effect.<ref>{{cite web|title=Konstitutionsutskottet bet\u00e4nkande 2012/13:KU16 Allm\u00e4nna helgdagar m.m.|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Utskottens-dokument/Betankanden/201213Allmanna-helgdagar-mm_H001KU16/|website=www.riksdagen.se|publisher=[[Riksdag|Sveriges Riksdag]]|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Tours ==\n=== Voyage to Southeast Asia and China 2005\u20132007 ===\n[[File:G\u00f6theborg gliding through the inner harbour of Goteborg.jpg|thumb|Returning home.]]\nAfter various tests and achieving its safety certificates from [[Det Norske Veritas]], the vessel sailed for China in October 2005, as the original vessel did, but it did not follow the same route.

The voyage took some 18 months, and the crew of 80 were rotated during harbour stops. The vessel returned to Gothenburg on 9{{nbsp}}June 2007, welcomed by the president of China, [[Hu Jintao]], who visited Sweden mainly for this reason, and by the King and Queen of Sweden, [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl Gustaf]] and [[Queen Silvia of Sweden|Silvia]].

The company followed the [[Portuguese East India Company|Portuguese]], [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], [[Danish East India Company|Danish]], [[French East India Company|French]] and [[East India Company|English]] East India Companies. Situated in Gothenburg, the company secured a 15-year [[monopoly]] on far eastern trade, exchanging Swedish [[Lumber|timber]], [[tar]], [[iron]] and [[copper]] for [[tea]], [[porcelain]] and [[silk]].{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nThe company existed for 82 years and its vessels made 131 voyages using 37 different ships.<ref>{{cite web|title=Expeditionerna: Kompaniets skepp|trans-title=The Expeditions: The Company's ships|url=http://ostindiska.nordiskamuseet.se/|website=www.nordiskamuseet.se/|publisher=The [[Nordic Museum]]|accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref> Even though the company in the end went bankrupt, it made enormous profits during most of its years in operation and influenced the [[history of Sweden]] in several ways.<ref>{{cite web|title=Svenska Ostindiska Kompaniet|url=http://www.ostindiskakompaniet.se/|website=www.ostindiskakompaniet.se|publisher=Ostindiska Kompaniet|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kjellberg|first1=Sven T.|title=Svenska ostindiska compagnierna 1731\u20131813: kryddor, te, porslin, siden|date=1974|publisher=Allhem|pages=177\u2013184|location=Malm\u00f6|isbn=91-7004-025-7|language=Swedish|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/8206995|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Original ship ==\n''G\u00f6theborg'' was built at the {{ill|Terra Nova shipyard|sv|Terra Nova (skeppsvarv)}} in Stockholm and launched in 1738. According to writer Bj\u00f6rn Ahlander, it only took about one and a half years to build a ship of this size in the 1700s. It was built in the Swedish capital and named ''G\u00f6theborg'' because the Swedish East India Company resided in Gothenburg, and all expeditions began and ended at this port. The ship had a [[tonnage]] equivalent to about {{convert|830|MT|lb|abbr=on}}. On its maiden voyage in 1739, the ship carried 30 cannons and an initial crew of 144.{{sfn|Ahlander|Langert|2009}}\n\nThe ship made three journeys to China and in 1745, it sank on its way into Gothenburg harbor. After 30 months at sea, and with only {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}} to go before the vessel reached its berth, it crashed into the Knipla B\u00f6r\u00f6, a well known rock. Although it remains a mystery how this could happen theories abound. The ship remained stranded on the rock while much of the cargo, consisting of tea, porcelain, spices and silk was salvaged. The ship was clearly visible above the surface of the water for many years, but in time the remains sank to the bottom.{{sfn|Ahlander|Langert|2009}}{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|pp=54\u201357}}\n\n=== Sinking ===\n{{Infobox archaeological_site\n  |name = Ostindieb\u00e5darna\n  |caption = Shipwreck location of the original ship\n  |map_type = Sweden V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland\n  |coordinates = {{coord|57.775003|11.758331|format=dms}}\n  |map_size = \n  |location = [[Gothenburg]]\n  |region = \n  |excavations = 1986\u20131992\n  |archaeologists = ''Marinarkeologiska S\u00e4llskapet, G\u00f6teborgskretsen''\n}}\n\nIt is still unclear what caused the ship to run aground due to the scarcity of contemporary written sources. The ''G\u00f6theborg'' had a very experienced [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] on board, Caspar Matthisson (1712\u20131783) from [[Br\u00e4nn\u00f6]], who had been a pilot for seven and a half years at the time of the accident. Even so, the ship suddenly ran aground, or crashed into, the underwater rock the ''Hunneb\u00e5dan''\u2014in the 18th century known as the ''Knipla B\u00f6r\u00f6'' and later the ''G\u00f6theborgs-grundet'' (\"the G\u00f6theborg's rock\") or the ''Ostindieb\u00e5darna'' (\"the East India shallow\").<ref>{{cite journal|last1=L\u00f6\u00f6f|first1=LarsOlof|title=Ostindiefararen G\u00f6theborg: f\u00f6rlisningen vid Nya \u00c4lvsborg och omst\u00e4ndigheterna kring olyckan|journal=G\u00f6teborg f\u00f6rr och nu|date=1998|editor=G\u00f6teborgs hembygdsf\u00f6rbund, 1960-|volume=1998 |issue=27|pages=45\u201358|url=http://libris.kb.se/export.jsp?type=showrecord&q=onr%3a2502879&id=2502879&d=libris&posts=1|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation | Excerpt from a contemporary transcript of Captain Eric Mor\u00e9en's ship's protest, 19{{nbsp}}September 1745:\n:...the impact was so hard that the front of the ship, which had struck the rock, was lifted {{convert|4.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} out of the water, and as the side had been holed, the ship soon began to take in a lot of water; it could be seen from the pump's water-level gauge that the water was 20, 30 and within a few minutes {{convert|60|in|m|abbr=on}} deep inside the ship. The danger was announced with cannon shots and normal signals...{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=55}}}}\n\nThe joint statement by captain Eric Mor\u00e9en and the crew to the ''G\u00f6teborgs R\u00e5dhusr\u00e4tt'' (\"the Municipal Court of Gothenburg\") on the 19{{nbsp}}September 1745 states that the weather on 12{{nbsp}}September was fair and clear, the wind amenable and blowing from south-west or west-southwest. These were ideal conditions since the wind would be coming almost straight from aft. Crossing the ''Riv\u00f6fjorden'' the ship met with the current from the northern part of [[G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv]], ''Nordre \u00e4lv''. Navigation and sailing seems to have been correct up until the time of the accident. Sailing at a speed of {{convert|3|kn|mph|abbr=on}} the ship suddenly veered to [[Port and starboard|starboard]] and hit the rock. The cause may have been a now almost forgotten [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] phenomenon called [[dead water]].{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=57}}\n\nHydrographic conditions at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv in September 1745, are well known. The discharge of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv was unusually large due to heavy snowfall during the winter of 1744\u201345. The water level of Lake [[V\u00e4nern]] was also extremely high in 1745. These factors combined into an increase in the volume of fresh water flowing into the ''\u00c4lvsborgsfjorden'', affecting the layers of fresh and salt water, making the conditions for dead water very favorable on 12{{nbsp}}September 1745.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lundh|first1=Valde|title=Varf\u00f6r gick skeppet G\u00f6theborg p\u00e5 grund h\u00f6sten 1745?|journal=Unda maris|date=2004|volume=2001/2003|pages=106\u2013122|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/9971760|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> It may be that the ''G\u00f6theborg'' was suddenly trapped by dead water when making its final change of course, causing the ship to lose rudder function, go off course and run aground.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=57}}\n\n=== Excavation ===\n[[File:Orignalitems.JPG|thumb|Items recovered from original ship.]]\nIn 9{{nbsp}}December 1984, five members from the ''Marinarkeologiska S\u00e4llskapet, G\u00f6teborgskretsen'' (MASG) (\"the Marine Archeological Society of Gothenburg\") dove at the Hunneb\u00e5dan, the site of the shipwreck. One of the participants, Anders W\u00e4stfelt chairman of the MASG, wrote in his report: \"Fair weather, sun, {{convert|7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in the air.

In 1986, research in archives and examination of the wreck site had confirmed the find as the ship G\u00f6theborg from 1738, and the Gothenburg Maritime museum was given permission from the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]] to excavate the site. At the same time the ''East Indiaman G\u00f6theborg Foundation'' (the first foundation) was established, marking the beginning of one of Sweden's most comprehensive [[Maritime archaeology|marine archeological]] surveys at the time. The purpose of the excavation was, among others, to use the wreck of the ''G\u00f6theborg'' as base for spreading knowledge about the history of Gothenburg and the significance of the Swedish East India Company during the 1700s.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|pp=62\u201364}}\n\n[[File:Porslinssk\u00e4rvor fr\u00e5n G\u00f6theborg.jpg|thumb|left|Porcelain items found during the excavation]]\nThe excavations were carried out during the summers 1986\u20131992. The seabed was first investigated using sub-bottom and side scan sonar. Secondly the divers went over the site with metal detectors and probes. To facilitate the excavations, the search area, measuring {{convert|26|by|36|m|abbr=on}}, was divided into a grid system comprising boxes measuring {{convert|2|by|2|m|abbr=on}}. The divers also had two giant suction devices, which sucked up sludge and clay into large sieves, where the smallest finds could be sorted. The remains of the cargo and the ship had settled during the years, together with fine clay, into a {{convert|30|to|40|cm|abbr=on}} thick carpet, hard to penetrate. A total of 5,750 finds were registered during the excavation. Most of it was porcelain, blue and white, blue and white with brown glaze, and multicolored made to order. In addition to this the finds also consisted of tea, [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] shells, [[galangal]], pepper, silk fabric, ingots of \"tutanego\" (these contained 99% zinc, 0,5% iron) not to be confused with [[Nickel silver|paktong]], cannonballs, lead shots, [[rapier]] handles, sword hilts, rigging material and objects belonging to the officers and crew. When compared to the Company's cargo list, which had been preserved, the finds from the excavation made up almost 10 per cent of the original cargo.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nDuring the excavations the thought of building a replica of the ''G\u00f6theborg'' started to form among the divers who had found the ship. The decision to excavate and rebuild the ship has generated large interest over the years from researchers, volunteers, professionals, sponsors and the public. Knowledge about 18th century history, trade with China and the Swedish East India Company has thereby increased substantially.{{sfn|Ahlander|Langert|2009}}\n\n== ''G\u00f6theborg'' revived ==\n[[File:Ostindiefararen G\u00f6theborg den 19 december 2004..JPG|thumb|Building the ''G\u00f6theborg'' at Eriksbergs 19{{nbsp}}December 2004.]]\nWhen the wreckage of the vessel ''G\u00f6theborg'' was found in 1984, the idea to make a replica of the vessel emerged. The [[keel]] for the replica was laid on 11{{nbsp}}June 1995. This was done at the disused [[Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad|Eriksbergs]] wharf by the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv in Gothenburg. Led by Master of Ceremonies Anders W\u00e4stfeldt, two silver coins, one from 1745, and one from 1995, were placed in the halved joints of the {{convert|33|m|ft|abbr=on}} long keel. About 3,000 people attended the forging of the keel, including S\u00f6ren Gyll, director of [[Volvo]] and professor Jorgen Weibull. The project was blessed by the vicar Alf \u00d6sterholm.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Svenska Ostindiska Companiet AB|title=Projektbeskrivning oktober 1996.|journal=Ostindiefararen G\u00f6theborg III|date=1996|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe construction and historical design of the ship was made by Joakim Severinsson. The blueprints for the ship was approved by international [[classification society]] [[Det Norske Veritas]] in November 1995.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Svenska Ostindiska Companiet AB|title=Projektbeskrivning oktober 1996.|journal=Ostindiefararen G\u00f6theborg III|date=1996|page=8}}</ref> All that was left of the Eriksbergs wharf were two-thirds of building berth number six, the large gantry crane and the dry dock. Around this, a new shipyard for building the ''G\u00f6theborg'' began to grow. A new ship's hall was built over the building berth, a timber workshop, a forge, a rigging workshop with a sail loft and some modern facilities such as a restaurant, offices and conference rooms were also added to the site. Since the wharf was built on reclaimed land, it seemed very apt to call it Terra Nova (\"new land\" in Latin) just like the wharf where the original vessel had been built.{{sfn|Ahlander|Langert|2009}}{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe vessel was built using old, traditional techniques, and it was made as close to the original as possible.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=13}} One small change was that the headroom of the deck was increased by 10&nbsp;cm, since today's seamen are taller than their ancestors.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=84}}\n\nWhile the exterior remains true to the original, the interior is highly modern. The ship has an electrical system and [[propeller]]s powered by [[diesel engine]]s. The engines were only intended for port navigation and emergency situations, but they have been used during unfavourable wind in order to keep the timetable for the journey to China. Other enhancements include [[satellite navigation]], communications equipment, modern facilities for the crew (kitchen, lavatories, washing machines, [[desalination]] equipment, ventilation, refrigerators), watertight [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] and fire protection (fire sprinkler systems, fire hydrants etc.). Most of this new technology was necessary to pass national and international safety regulations.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe vessel was launched on 6{{nbsp}}June 2003, with great festivities and in the presence of representatives from the [[Swedish Royal Family]].{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=96}}\n\nTen tons of hemp ropes were used for rigging the vessel, together with some 1,000 blocks and {{convert|1,964|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} linen sail. All this was produced using 18th century techniques. The first trial under sail began on 18{{nbsp}}April 2005.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|pp=86\u201387}}\n\n=== Financing ===\nAt its completion in 2005, the project had cost about 250 million SEK (almost $40 million), some 40% from public funds and the rest from sponsors.<ref name=Svd250>{{cite web|last1=Hansson|first1=Matilda|title=Ostindiefararen anl\u00f6per Stockholm|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/ostindiefararen-anloper-stockholm_448255.svd|website=www.svd.se|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the years the ship has been in the care of two foundations. The first foundation consisted of [[Volvo]], [[SKF]], [[Stena Line]] and the [[Port of Gothenburg]] among others. This foundation financed the ship up until the end of the journey to China and in 2010, its economical commitment ended. The second foundation, a non-profitable foundation, for the ship was created shortly afterwards. The business is operated by The Swedish East India Company Ltd. In January 2011, questions were raised about the future of the ship. The [[Gothenburg Municipality]] was willing to pay for the ongoing maintenance of the ship if sponsors made contributions for the expeditions and other activities. An immediate liquidation of the operation and turning the ship into a museum was also suggested.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bozinovska|first1=Snezana|title=F\u00e4rdigseglat f\u00f6r Ostindiefararen?|url=http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.532498-fardigseglat-for-ostindiefararen-|website=www.gp.se|publisher=G\u00f6teborgs-Posten|accessdate=9 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119202146/http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.532498-fardigseglat-for-ostindiefararen-|archive-date=19 January 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In February 2011, the future plans for the ship were postponed by the [[V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland Regional Council]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Losman|first1=Birgitta|title=Pressmeddelande|url=http://nyheter.vgregion.se/sv/Nyheter/Regionutveckling/Pressarkiv/Rubrik/|website=www.vgregion.se|publisher=[[V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland Regional Council]]|accessdate=9 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714152419/http://nyheter.vgregion.se/sv/Nyheter/Regionutveckling/Pressarkiv/Rubrik/|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, the Greencarrier Group announced they would be supporting and funding ''G\u00f6theborg's'' future sailing ventures.<ref>https://greencarrier.com/press-release/we-are-very-pleased-to-announce-that-greencarrier-is-enabling-the-ship-gotheborg-to-sail-again/</ref> There are plans for the ship to sail to several different ports around the world, as well as taking part in different sailing events.

It is a replica of the ''G\u00f6theborg I'' which sank outside Gothenburg in 1745. A second ship the ''G\u00f6theborg II'' was built in Gothenburg in 1786. It was the largest{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=18}} of all the SOIC vessels and it made three journeys to Canton: 2{{nbsp}}February 1788\u201313{{nbsp}}May 1790, 13{{nbsp}}November 1791\u201312{{nbsp}}June 1793, and on 5{{nbsp}}December 1795, the ship sailed for Canton but was lost at [[Cape Town]] on 8{{nbsp}}March 1796, on the way out from Gothenburg.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=182\u2013183}}\n\n=== Crew ===\nWhen leaving its home port the original ship could have over 130 crew members. This number of hands was necessary since many of the sailors died from diseases or disappeared during storms. Even though it was a high risk job under difficult conditions, the company did not have any problems recruiting sailors for these well paid jobs. Many of the recruits were poor young men, sons of farmers, seeking opportunity to become wealthy. The replica has a crew of 80 sailors.{{sfn|Arensberg|2009|p=99}}\n\n=== Flag ===\n[[File:Vshaped flag.JPG|thumb|The swallowtailed SOIC flag.]]\nThe East Indiaman ''G\u00f6theborg'' is classified as a passenger ship sailing under the ordinary Swedish flag. But when in port, the ship is entitled to fly the old swallowtailed version of the flag, the SOIC flag (''Svenska Ostindiska Companiet'', \"Swedish East India Company\"), that the original vessel sailed under.<ref>{{cite journal|title=no title|journal=[[G\u00f6teborgs-Posten]]|date=6 October 2005|page=10}}</ref>\n\nThe flag used on Swedish boats is the ordinary, rectangular flag. Swedish warships, or ships carrying a military commander, fly the Swedish [[ensign]] a triple-tailed or swallowtail and tongue version of the rectangular flag. The Swedish East India Company displayed a fork-tailed or swallow-tailed flag on their ships. The intention was that the ship should resemble a warship and thereby not attract pirates. This was against the rules and regulations for flags at that time. The use of the swallowtail was prohibited in a royal decree in 1751, but the SOIC ignored this and ordered their flags in Canton instead.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=174\u2013175}} In a memorandum to the [[Riksdag]] in 2012, a proposition was made to a grant dispensation from the prohibition.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Utbult|first1=Roland|title=Motion 2012/13:K205 Tv\u00e5tungad flagga f\u00f6r fritidsb\u00e5tar|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Forslag/Motioner/mot-201213K205-Tvatungad-fla_H002K205/?text=true|website=www.riksdagen.se|publisher=[[Riksdag|Sveriges Riksdag]]|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> The proposition was declined and the decree is still in effect.<ref>{{cite web|title=Konstitutionsutskottet bet\u00e4nkande 2012/13:KU16 Allm\u00e4nna helgdagar m.m.|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Utskottens-dokument/Betankanden/201213Allmanna-helgdagar-mm_H001KU16/|website=www.riksdagen.se|publisher=[[Riksdag|Sveriges Riksdag]]|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Tours ==\n=== Voyage to Southeast Asia and China 2005\u20132007 ===\n[[File:G\u00f6theborg gliding through the inner harbour of Goteborg.jpg|thumb|Returning home.]]\nAfter various tests and achieving its safety certificates from [[Det Norske Veritas]], the vessel sailed for China in October 2005, as the original vessel did, but it did not follow the same route. The vessel berthed at the [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront|Victoria and Alfred Waterfront]] in Cape Town, and then left for [[Hout Bay]] before continuing on its voyage. The voyage took some 18 months, and the crew of 80 were rotated during harbour stops. The vessel returned to Gothenburg on 9{{nbsp}}June 2007, welcomed by the president of China, [[Hu Jintao]], who visited Sweden mainly for this reason, and by the King and Queen of Sweden, [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl Gustaf]] and [[Queen Silvia of Sweden|Silvia]].

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]]. At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder. Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, and Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref name=Beginning />\n\nThe second director of the School, [[Percy Nobbs]], arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students: Gordon H. Blackader and H.&nbsp;E. Shorey. He divided the four-year course into two streams, the B.Arch. degree and the B.Sc. degree in Architectural Engineering.

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students.

In addition to the seven schools with whom the School of Architecture has bilateral agreements, architecture students have spent exchange semesters at some of the top architecture schools in the world, including [[The Bartlett]] at [[University College London (UCL)]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe School of Architecture offers a professional program in Architecture comprising a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSc[Arch]) and professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree, as well as post-professional graduate programs leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and post-professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree. The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 50 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios, the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in U0, taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or U1, but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students.

In addition to the seven schools with whom the School of Architecture has bilateral agreements, architecture students have spent exchange semesters at some of the top architecture schools in the world, including [[The Bartlett]] at [[University College London (UCL)]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe School of Architecture offers a professional program in Architecture comprising a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSc[Arch]) and professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree, as well as post-professional graduate programs leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and post-professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree. The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 50 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios, the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in U0, taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or U1, but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades.

{"title_page": "Nollaig \u00d3 Mura\u00edle", "text_new": "{{No footnotes|date=November 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n'''Nollaig \u00d3 Mura\u00edle''' is an Irish scholar. He published an acclaimed edition of [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]]'s ''[[Leabhar na nGenealach]]'' in 2004. He was admitted to the [[Royal Irish Academy]] in 2009.\n\n==Life and career==\nA native of [[Knock, County Mayo]], \u00d3 Mura\u00edle attended [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth]] where he was a postgraduate student enrolled for a [[PhD]]. He was Placenames Officer with the Ordnance Survey of Ireland 1972\u20131993. He was Reader in Irish and Celtic Studies at [[Queen's University Belfast]] to 2004 and Senior Lecturer at the Department of Irish, [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] from 2005\u20132014. He is married to Tresa N\u00ed Chian\u00e1in and has two children.  He lives in Dublin.\n\n==\u00d3 Mura\u00edle and Mac Fhirbhisigh==\nIn 1971, at the suggestion of [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich]], then Professor of Modern History at Maynooth, \u00d3 Mura\u00edle began work on [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]]'s ''[[Leabhar na nGenealach]]''. This was continued under the direction of Professor of Old and Middle Irish [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Fiannachta]].\n\nUpon joining the Placenames Branch of the Ordnance Survey in late 1972, \u00d3 Mura\u00edle had already translated over one hundred pages, albeit from [[Eugene O'Curry]]'s copy. Access to the autograph of Leabhar na nGenealach however remained difficult; only on 28 August 1979, at [[University College Dublin]]'s new home of Belfield, was he able to begin transcription of the original, which he finished on 10 September 1981. It had taken a total of 88 sessions in UCD Special Collections Reading Room. Typing began in late 1982 and was complete by 4 September 1984. By early 1988, after much tedious work, the ''Cumire'' was also successfully in transcript. His [[PhD]] dissertation, submitted in September 1991 on the life, background and work of Mac Fhirbhisigh, was fully two volumes, totalling 1,086 pages.\n\nEarly in 1998, \u00d3 Mura\u00edle was approached by fellow Mayoman, \u00c9amonn de B\u00farca, with an offer to publish his edition of ''Leabhar na nGenealach''. De Burca insisted on a full translation of the text into English (with the original Irish text on the facing page) in opposition to \u00d3 Mura\u00edle's wish to publish with Irish text only. De B\u00farca prevailed, and the book, titled ''The Great Book of Irish Genealogies'', was published in five volumes (vols. IV and V consisting of indices alone) in 2004, with 3,100 pages in a full buckram gilt presentation box. It remains \u00d3 Mura\u00edle's unique contribution to Irish scholarship.\n\n==Publications==\nThe following is a provisional list of \u00d3 Mura\u00edle's publications.\n\n===Articles===\n* ''Fil\u00ed ch\u00faige Connacht sa nao\u00fa aois d\u00e9ag'', in ''Litr\u00edocht an 19\u00fa haois / in eagar ag P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Fiannachta'', M\u00e1 Nuad: An Sagart, 1972\n* ''Toirialach \u00d3 Cear\u00fall\u00e1in'', same publication.\n* ''Swinford and its Name:Some Aspects of Swinford History'', in ''Swinford Re-Echo'', [[Swinford]], 1981.\n* ''An Outline History of Co.

He published an acclaimed edition of [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]]'s ''[[Leabhar na nGenealach]]'' in 2004. He was admitted to the [[Royal Irish Academy]] in 2009.\n\n==Life and career==\nA native of [[Knock, County Mayo]], \u00d3 Mura\u00edle attended [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth]] where he was a postgraduate student enrolled for a [[PhD]]. He was Placenames Officer with the Ordnance Survey of Ireland 1972\u20131993. He was Reader in Irish and Celtic Studies at [[Queen's University Belfast]] to 2004 and Senior Lecturer at the Department of Irish, [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] from 2005\u20132014. He is married to Tresa N\u00ed Chian\u00e1in and has two children.  He lives in Dublin.\n\n==\u00d3 Mura\u00edle and Mac Fhirbhisigh==\nIn 1971, at the suggestion of [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich]], then Professor of Modern History at Maynooth, \u00d3 Mura\u00edle began work on [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]]'s ''[[Leabhar na nGenealach]]''. This was continued under the direction of Professor of Old and Middle Irish [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Fiannachta]].\n\nUpon joining the Placenames Branch of the Ordnance Survey in late 1972, \u00d3 Mura\u00edle had already translated over one hundred pages, albeit from [[Eugene O'Curry]]'s copy. Access to the autograph of Leabhar na nGenealach however remained difficult; only on 28 August 1979, at [[University College Dublin]]'s new home of Belfield, was he able to begin transcription of the original, which he finished on 10 September 1981. It had taken a total of 88 sessions in UCD Special Collections Reading Room. Typing began in late 1982 and was complete by 4 September 1984. By early 1988, after much tedious work, the ''Cumire'' was also successfully in transcript. His [[PhD]] dissertation, submitted in September 1991 on the life, background and work of Mac Fhirbhisigh, was fully two volumes, totalling 1,086 pages.\n\nEarly in 1998, \u00d3 Mura\u00edle was approached by fellow Mayoman, \u00c9amonn de B\u00farca, with an offer to publish his edition of ''Leabhar na nGenealach''. De Burca insisted on a full translation of the text into English (with the original Irish text on the facing page) in opposition to \u00d3 Mura\u00edle's wish to publish with Irish text only. De B\u00farca prevailed, and the book, titled ''The Great Book of Irish Genealogies'', was published in five volumes (vols. IV and V consisting of indices alone) in 2004, with 3,100 pages in a full buckram gilt presentation box. It remains \u00d3 Mura\u00edle's unique contribution to Irish scholarship.\n\n==Publications==\nThe following is a provisional list of \u00d3 Mura\u00edle's publications.\n\n===Articles===\n* ''Fil\u00ed ch\u00faige Connacht sa nao\u00fa aois d\u00e9ag'', in ''Litr\u00edocht an 19\u00fa haois / in eagar ag P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Fiannachta'', M\u00e1 Nuad: An Sagart, 1972\n* ''Toirialach \u00d3 Cear\u00fall\u00e1in'', same publication.\n* ''Swinford and its Name:Some Aspects of Swinford History'', in ''Swinford Re-Echo'', [[Swinford]], 1981.\n* ''An Outline History of Co.

Scopolia's extract (which contains a form of the alkaloid [[scopolamine]]) is used in at least one commercial stomach remedy ([[Inosea]], produced by [[Sato Pharmaceutical]]).
