It was the first institution in the country for \"colored persons of unsound mind\".\n\nCentral State Hospital serves the [[Greater Richmond Region]] of Virginia, providing [[forensic psychiatry]] and civil admissions ranging from short-term treatment to long-term intensive treatment for the most seriously [[mental disorder|mentally ill]].\n\n==History==\n===Overview===\n[[Image:diversional-occupation-csh.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Diversional occupation]]\nIn 1848, [[slavery|slaves]] in Virginia could be admitted to private asylums if their owners paid for their treatment, but not all owners could afford it, and whites were always given priority admission. It was also believed that when blacks tried to flee captivity, they were suffering from a mental illness called [[drapetomania]], which [[Samuel A. Cartwright]] stated to be a consequence of masters who \"made themselves too familiar with slaves, treating them as equals\".\n\nThe [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] established a hospital for wounded soldiers at Howard's Grove in 1862. It was reassigned in 1870 to the treatment of \"colored persons of unsound mind\" and was the first to offer treatment exclusively to the black population of Virginia. [[Dorothea Dix]] visited the hospital in 1875, during her travels for mental health reform, and donated pictures and musical instruments.\n\n[[Image:chronic-female-csh.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Building for chronically ill females]]\nIn 1885, the patients from Howard's Grove were transferred to a newly built red-brick hospital trimmed with gray granite. It had a central four-storey administration building flanked on either side by a three-story wing containing six wards. This arrangement, which is known as the [[Kirkbride Plan]], was a symbol of [[moral treatment]]. The East and West Buildings were built on either side of the main building in 1890 and 1892 to treat more severe cases.\n\nThe Legislature of 1893 changed the title of state \"asylums\" to state \"hospitals\" and the [[lunatic asylum]] was renamed a [[state hospital]]. In 1896, a two-story brick pavilion was built and the hospital became one of the first to care specifically for [[list of people with epilepsy|people with epilepsy]]. Patients were classified and assigned to wards for the recent and [[acute (medicine)|acute]], [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]], demented, sick, [[tuberculosis|tubercular]], epileptic, criminal and suicidal. The wards for the suicidal were the least furnished.\n\n[[Image:delinquent-girls-1929.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Building for delinquent females]]\n[[Mayfield Cottage]] was built in 1750 and was the oldest brick residence in the county. The hospital purchased the farm land on which it was built, and used it as a storehouse for many years.\n\nIn 1904, a one-and-a-half-story [[Central State Hospital Chapel|chapel]] was built as a multi-purpose space for religious services, dances, concerts, and graduation ceremonies for the hospital's nursing students. Its simple 80x50 foot [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival design]] was conceived by Dr. William Francis Drewry and constructed by G. B. Keeler & Son. Twenty-four fire hydrants were installed and a fire house was built. Drying machinery was purchased for the laundry and an internal telephone system was installed. Workshops were established for carpentry, shoe repair, broom- and mattress-making. These activities were used as occupational therapy.\n\nThe building for chronic females was built in 1915 for 160 patients along with one for male patients. In 1925, [[hydrotherapy]] tubs were installed on the first floor to provide a new form of treatment.\n\nFrom the opening of the hospital until 1915, the supposed causes of [[psychosis]] in those admitted included abortion, desertion, emancipation, marriage, masturbation, and typhoid fever. Some of the foods grown on the farm were [[alfalfa]], [[peanut]]s, [[wheat]], [[radish]]es, pumpkins, okra, watermelon, turkey, and milk.\n\n[[Image:lodge-in-woods-csh-1915.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Lodge in woods]]\nThe building for delinquent and feeble-minded girls was built in 1929 with a 100-foot barred arcade leading to the central building. In 1930, the new medical building was built for 100 beds. More wings were added to it later. The first floor was used for surgery, examinations, dentistry, lectures, x-rays, laboratories, treatment, and drug therapy. The second and third floors were for bedridden patients, so that they were undisturbed by out-patient and ambulatory services downstairs.\n\nIn 1938 a State Colony for people with epilepsy was established on the grounds of the state hospital and later admitted the mentally disabled. It was renamed a training school and hospital in 1954 and then a training center in 1971.\n\nIn the 1950s the patient population reached 4,800 with the construction of a maximum security forensic building and geriatric unit. Overcrowding was an increasing problem: the East View ward had 300 patients in one large room, and patients in the criminals' building were sleeping on the floor.\n\nThe hospital served only African Americans until the Civil Rights Acts of 1964. From 1967 it accepted all races and nationalities. In 1978 Mayfield Cottage was sold to the Caudle family, who moved the structure a mile away to save it from demolition and opened it as a bed-and-breakfast in 1986.\n\n==Accusations==\n===Sterilization===\n[[Image:male-psychopathic-csh.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Building for male psychopaths]]\nIn 1980, around 1,700 patients were [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilized]] without their consent. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, four of the 7,205 people sterilized in the state of Virginia filed a class-action lawsuit requiring the state of Virginia to notify every patient sterilized between 1924 and 1973 and to pay for operations to reverse the procedure.

The film stars [[Hayley Mills]] who plays the roles of the thirteen-year-old twin girls, Sharon and Susan. [[Maureen O'Hara]] and [[Brian Keith]] play the twins\u2019 parents, Maggie and Mitch. The film is about the two girls who meet at a summer camp as strangers and realize that they are identical twins. They switch places so that each can meet the other parent, and they plan to bring their divorced parents back together. Soon after switching, the twins learn that there is a new woman, named Vicky Robinson (played by [[Joanna Barnes]]), in their father's life. After Mitch tells Sharon about his engagement to Vicky, the girls come up with a new game plan to get rid of the woman who threatens their plan to reconnect their parents.<ref>''The Parent Trap.''

It was directed by [[Ronald F. Maxwell]]. The film is a continuation of the Walt Disney film ''The Parent Trap''. ''The Parent Trap II'' was filmed twenty-five years after the original film. The idea of a second film was announced in 1985. The only actor who returned from the original film, Hayley Mills, continues to portray the twins, Sharon and Susan. ''The Parent Trap II'' focuses on Sharon's daughter Nikki who tries to set up her mother with her best friend's father, portrayed by [[Tom Skerritt]]. All the music was composed by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] as well as the title song \"Lets Keep What We Got\" was performed by [[Marilyn McCoo]].\n\n===''Parent Trap III'' (1989)===\n\n{{Main|Parent Trap III}}\n''The Parent Trap II'' was such a success for the Disney Channel that it spawned another made-for-television sequel, ''Parent Trap III'', in 1989. Hayley Mills again reprises her roles as twins Sharon and Susan, with [[Barry Bostwick]] as a father of triplet girls and [[Patricia Richardson]] as his snobbish girlfriend.\n\n===''Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon'' (1989)===\n{{Main|Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon}}\n''Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon'' (1989) is the final made-for-television sequel, with Hayley Mills again reprising her roles as Sharon and Susan, now both remarried.

The remake caught the attention of audiences when it premiered on July 29, 1998. The parents of the twins, Nick Parker (played by [[Dennis Quaid]]) and Elizabeth James (played by [[Natasha Richardson]]), marry on a cruise ship and quickly figure out their lives are in two separate places. They each take one of the twins and then go their separate ways. Eleven years pass and the identical twins, Annie James and Hallie Parker, embark on their summer journeys not knowing each other. The initial rivalry between them turns out to bring them closer and they realize that they must be sisters. Their new goal is to make their parents fall in love again before their father and his fianc\u00e9 Meredeth Blake (played by [[Elaine Hendrix]]) marry. The film was directed by [[Nancy Meyers]].\n\n===Potential remake===\nOn February 8, 2018, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' revealed that remakes of several live-action films are in development as exclusive content for [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Studios]]' upcoming streaming service [[Disney+]]; with one of those named in the announcement being ''The Parent Trap''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/disney-planning-muppets-reboot-streaming-service-1086800 |title=Disney Planning Another 'Muppets' Reboot for Its Streaming Service (Exclusive) |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Documentary on the film series==\n\n\nFamily Films Productions is developing ''The Legacy of The Parent Trap'', a documentary film that gives a retrospective insight into developing ''The Parent Trap''. <ref>http://www.familyfilmsproductions.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWzPemw75M8|title=The Legacy of The Parent Trap - Official Film Trailer |first=|last=FamilyFilmsProductions.com|date=23 June 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> The film will reportedly feature memories and stories of various cast and crew, about the original 1961 film and its three sequels.

During the following decade, the population began to decrease due to the emphasis on deinstitutionalization, the addition of other public psychiatric (regional) hospitals throughout the state, the availability of psychotropic medications, an increase in community mental health programs, and many individuals moving to community living arrangements. During FY2004-FY2005, the hospital served more than 9,000 consumers (duplicates counted) - from nearly every Georgia county.\n\nIn 2010, the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities announced that the hospital would be closed,[http://www.gpb.org/news/2010/01/20/central-state-closing-to-mental-health-patients] but it has not been; instead, it has become the state's treatment and custodial center for justice system referrals and commitments.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:CSH grave representation.jpg|A symbolic representation of the more than 25,000 patients buried in unmarked graves throughout the hospital grounds</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of hospitals in the United States]]\n*[[List of hospitals in Georgia (U.S. state)|List of hospitals in Georgia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Sources\n* Book, Constance Ledoux, and David Ezell. \"Freedom of Speech and Institutional Control: Patient Publications at Central State Hospital, 1934-1978.\" ''Georgia Historical Quarterly'' 85 (2001): 106-26.\n* Cranford, Peter G.

In 1869, 200 acres were purchased by the Kentucky State Legislature from the descendants of renown frontiersman Issac Hite to establish a \"State House of Reform for Juvenile Delinquents.\" This was located on the outskirts of what would become [[Anchorage, Kentucky]]. In 1873, due to overcrowding at both of Kentucky's mental hospitals, the House of Reform was converted into the '''Fourth Kentucky Lunatic Asylum''', with Dr. C.C. Forbes as its first Superintendent. The following year an act of the legislature renamed it the '''Central Kentucky Lunatic Asylum'''. In late 1887, it received its own post office, called simply \"Asylum\". The following year its name was changed to \"Lakeland\", and the institution was commonly referred to as \"Lakeland Hospital\" or \"Lakeland Asylum\". By 1900, its official name had been changed to the '''Central Kentucky Asylum for the Insane'''.  By 1912 it was known as Central State Hospital. Comparable institutions are Eastern State Hospital at Lexington in Fayette County and Western State Hospital at Hopkinsville, Christian County, Kentucky. All three were administered by the Board of Charitable Organizations.\n\nThe secluded, rural setting was typical of such facilities in the late 19th century, as such an environment was thought to be beneficial for recovery from mental illness. However, not all patients had mental disorders - some suffered from brain damage, mental retardation or were simply poor or elderly. The early years of the 1880s were marked by repeated allegations of patient abuse. In 1879, Dr. Robert H.

Though built to accommodate 1,600 patients, by 1940 there were in excess of 2,400 patients and again various accusations of patient mistreatment began to arise. However, starting in the 1950s, changing community perception of the mentally disturbed led to fewer patients staying permanently in mental hospitals. In 1962, $3,000,000 was allowed by the state to construct more modern facilities on LaGrange Road. Many of these are still standing.\n\nIn 1986, a new modern administration facility was completed on property adjacent to the 1960s buildings. The original hospital and surviving structures on what was called \"the North Campus\"  were subsequently abandoned and demolished in the late 1990s.\n\nIt is unknown how many deceased patients are buried on the hospital grounds, though over 900 death certificates exist denoting burial in both of the hospitals cemeteries.\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Anchorage, Kentucky]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Central_State_Hospital_Louisville Asylum Projects website information and history on CSH]\n* [https://kentuckyhistoricinstitutions.com/asylums/central-state-hospital/ The Kentucky Historic Institutions CSH Page]\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n{{Kirkbride Plan}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1874]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:19th-century buildings and structures in Louisville, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Infrastructure in Louisville, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Psychiatric hospitals in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Louisville, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Hospital buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:1874 establishments in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Anchorage, Kentucky]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = Central Kentucky Lunatic Asylum\n  | nrhp_type = \n  | image = \n  | caption = \n  | nearest_city= [[Anchorage, Kentucky]]\n  | coordinates = {{coord|38|16|41|N|85|33|18|W|display=inline,title}}\n| locmapin = Kentucky#USA\n  | built = 1874\n  | architect = \n  | architecture = Classical Revival, Tudor Revival\n  | added = July 12, 1983\n  | area = less than one acre\n  | governing_body = State\n  | mpsub = {{NRHP url|id=64000231|title=Jefferson County MRA}}\n  | refnum = 83002646<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref>\n}}\n'''Central State Hospital''' is a 192-bed adult [[psychiatric hospital]] located in eastern [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville-Jefferson County, Kentucky]].

Though built to accommodate 1,600 patients, by 1940 there were in excess of 2,400 patients and again various accusations of patient mistreatment began to arise. However, starting in the 1950s, changing community perception of the mentally disturbed led to fewer patients staying permanently in mental hospitals. In 1962, $3,000,000 was allowed by the state to construct more modern facilities on LaGrange Road. Many of these are still standing.\n\nIn 1986, a new modern administration facility was completed on property adjacent to the 1960s buildings. The original hospital and surviving structures on what was called \"the North Campus\"  were subsequently abandoned and demolished in the late 1990s.\n\nIt is unknown how many deceased patients are buried on the hospital grounds, though over 900 death certificates exist denoting burial in both of the hospitals cemeteries.\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Anchorage, Kentucky]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Central_State_Hospital_Louisville Asylum Projects website information and history on CSH]\n* [https://kentuckyhistoricinstitutions.com/asylums/central-state-hospital/ The Kentucky Historic Institutions CSH Page]\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n{{Kirkbride Plan}}\n\n[[Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1874]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:19th-century buildings and structures in Louisville, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Infrastructure in Louisville, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Psychiatric hospitals in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Louisville, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Hospital buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:1874 establishments in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Anchorage, Kentucky]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_State_Hospital_(Kentucky)"}

The Indiana Hospital for the Insane finally opened in November 1848 with a total of five patients. At that time, the hospital consisted of one brick building situated on a large parcel of land of over {{convert|100|acre|km2}} on [[Washington Street (Indianapolis)|Washington Street]], west of [[downtown Indianapolis]]. In 1889 the hospital was renamed the Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane. After 1926 it was known as Central State Hospital, and by 1928, physicians cared for nearly 3,000 patients.\n\nFrom 1848 to 1948, the hospital grew yearly until it encompassed two massive ornate buildings (one for male and one for female patients); a pathological department; a \"sick\" hospital for the treatment of physical ailments; a farm colony where patients engaged in \"occupational therapy\"; a chapel; an amusement hall complete with an auditorium, billiards, and bowling alleys; a bakery; a fire house; a cannery manned by patients; and idyllic gardens and fountains.\n\nThe more ornate of the two massive buildings came to be known as \"the Seven Steeples\". This building, which housed female patients, was designed using the [[Kirkbride Plan]] for mental healthcare facilities.\n\nFor a half-century, this complex buildings and gardens housed mentally ill patients from all regions of Indiana. By 1905, however, the state had built mental health institutions in [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]], [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]], [[Madison, Indiana|Madison]], and [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]], thereby relieving an overcrowded Central State Hospital of some of its patient load and leaving it to treat only those from the \"central district\", an area of 38 counties situated in the middle portion of the state. In 1950 patient population reached 2,500\n\nBy the early 1970s, most of the hospital's ostentatious Victorian-era buildings had been declared unsound and razed. The Men's Department Building (also a Kirkbride Plan structure) had been demolished already in 1941. In their place, the state constructed brick buildings of a nondescript, institutional genre. These modern buildings and the medical staff therein continued to serve the state's mentally ill until allegations of [[patient abuse]] and funding troubles sparked an effort to forge new alternatives to institutionalization which, in turn, led to the hospital's closure in 1994.\n\n==Current status==\n[[Image:1886powerplant.jpg|thumb|The 1886 Power Plant]]\nThe grounds of Central State Hospital were still largely vacant as of 2011. In place of the demolished Women's Ward (Seven Steeples) is a large lawn. There are approximately 10 buildings on the grounds that were associated with the hospital. The Pathology Department building, built in 1895, is well preserved and houses the [[Indiana Medical History Museum]]. The three more modern wards (Evans, Bolton, and Bahr) were built in 1974 when the others were demolished. The oldest building on the property is the old power house, built in 1886. The Administration building, which was built in 1938, is now most commonly associated with the hospital, although it never housed patients. In 2005, the Beckmann Theatre was granted temporary occupancy of the 1895 Laundry Building where it staged its production of \"Asylum\".<ref>[http://www.beckmanntheatre.org/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802214906/http://www.beckmanntheatre.org/ |date=August 2, 2008 }}</ref> More recently, the building has been used for storing cars.\n\nThe Indiana State Archives, the Indiana State Library, and the Indiana Medical History Museum (housed in one of the hospital's remaining nineteenth-century edifices), are preserving the history of an institution that served the mentally ill of Indiana for 146 years.\n\n[[Image:centralstatelg.jpg|thumb|Buildings on the Grounds of Central State]]In March 2003, the city of Indianapolis purchased the property from the state for $400,000.

The Indiana Hospital for the Insane finally opened in November 1848 with a total of five patients. At that time, the hospital consisted of one brick building situated on a large parcel of land of over {{convert|100|acre|km2}} on [[Washington Street (Indianapolis)|Washington Street]], west of [[downtown Indianapolis]]. In 1889 the hospital was renamed the Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane. After 1926 it was known as Central State Hospital, and by 1928, physicians cared for nearly 3,000 patients.\n\nFrom 1848 to 1948, the hospital grew yearly until it encompassed two massive ornate buildings (one for male and one for female patients); a pathological department; a \"sick\" hospital for the treatment of physical ailments; a farm colony where patients engaged in \"occupational therapy\"; a chapel; an amusement hall complete with an auditorium, billiards, and bowling alleys; a bakery; a fire house; a cannery manned by patients; and idyllic gardens and fountains.\n\nThe more ornate of the two massive buildings came to be known as \"the Seven Steeples\". This building, which housed female patients, was designed using the [[Kirkbride Plan]] for mental healthcare facilities.\n\nFor a half-century, this complex buildings and gardens housed mentally ill patients from all regions of Indiana. By 1905, however, the state had built mental health institutions in [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]], [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]], [[Madison, Indiana|Madison]], and [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]], thereby relieving an overcrowded Central State Hospital of some of its patient load and leaving it to treat only those from the \"central district\", an area of 38 counties situated in the middle portion of the state. In 1950 patient population reached 2,500\n\nBy the early 1970s, most of the hospital's ostentatious Victorian-era buildings had been declared unsound and razed. The Men's Department Building (also a Kirkbride Plan structure) had been demolished already in 1941. In their place, the state constructed brick buildings of a nondescript, institutional genre. These modern buildings and the medical staff therein continued to serve the state's mentally ill until allegations of [[patient abuse]] and funding troubles sparked an effort to forge new alternatives to institutionalization which, in turn, led to the hospital's closure in 1994.\n\n==Current status==\n[[Image:1886powerplant.jpg|thumb|The 1886 Power Plant]]\nThe grounds of Central State Hospital were still largely vacant as of 2011. In place of the demolished Women's Ward (Seven Steeples) is a large lawn. There are approximately 10 buildings on the grounds that were associated with the hospital. The Pathology Department building, built in 1895, is well preserved and houses the [[Indiana Medical History Museum]]. The three more modern wards (Evans, Bolton, and Bahr) were built in 1974 when the others were demolished. The oldest building on the property is the old power house, built in 1886. The Administration building, which was built in 1938, is now most commonly associated with the hospital, although it never housed patients. In 2005, the Beckmann Theatre was granted temporary occupancy of the 1895 Laundry Building where it staged its production of \"Asylum\".<ref>[http://www.beckmanntheatre.org/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802214906/http://www.beckmanntheatre.org/ |date=August 2, 2008 }}</ref> More recently, the building has been used for storing cars.\n\nThe Indiana State Archives, the Indiana State Library, and the Indiana Medical History Museum (housed in one of the hospital's remaining nineteenth-century edifices), are preserving the history of an institution that served the mentally ill of Indiana for 146 years.\n\n[[Image:centralstatelg.jpg|thumb|Buildings on the Grounds of Central State]]In March 2003, the city of Indianapolis purchased the property from the state for $400,000.

As a result, Taobao became mainland China's undisputed market leader within two years. Its market share surged from 8% to 59% between 2003 and 2005, while eBay China plunged from 79% to 36%.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"China's pied piper\". The Economist.

Taobao Mall established itself as the destination for quality brand name goods for Chinese consumers. Taobao Mall launched an independent web domain, [[Tmall]].com, and enhanced its focus on product verticals and improvements in shopping experience in November 2010. It became an independent business in June 2011 and changed its Chinese name to Tian Mao ([[Tmall]]) in January 2012.

Online shoppers can use the site to compare prices from different sellers and identify products to buy.

The five-story 25,000sqm Taobao Mall iFengChao Furniture Showroom opened as a complement to their online stores.\n\nIn June 2011, [[Alibaba Group]] Executive Chairman and former CEO [[Jack Ma]] announced that Taobao would split into three different companies: Taobao Marketplace (a C2C platform), Tmall.com (a B2C platform; then called Taobao Mall), and eTao (a search engine for online shopping).

Ma introduced Taobao to the outside world by stating, \"We are the ant army.\" Ma once organized more than 2,000 employees at a gymnasium to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the founding ceremony.

The ants that be organized together can beat the elephant.\"\n\n=== Shop feedback ===\n\nTo thoroughly investigate a Taobao shop, a good way is to view its feedback by clicking the shop's rating icon. For Tmall.com shops, people click the stars to view their ratings. Taobao users usually spend time to read feedback and compare items of one shop with those of others.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to read taobao shop feedbacks?\". NewBuyBay Taobao Agent. January 13, 2013|url=http://www.newbuybay.com/Article/ArtView/126}}</ref> Feedback put up by the user can be genuine or made up which users have to thoroughly read through to conclude. If the feedback style and tone is same, likely, it's made up. Some of the feedback can also be posted by competitors. Users have to look at the majority of the feedback to deduce whether the feedback are genuine. The best way to conclude whether the item is truly worth buying is to look at the available feedback that are posted by users after they've used the item for a period of time.\n\nFor every trade deal on Taobao, there must be a section of customer feedback, which is a determination factor of the sale volume for the shop. Therefore, the shop owners often put effort to maximize the positive comments and eliminate the negative ones. Even profitable negotiations happen between sellers and the consumers for rating their satisfactions toward the commodity and their shopping experiences.\nIn order to collect public perspectives towards Taobao services, searching tools and other functions are used to determine and learn the users\u2019 demands, which could help Taobao make more improvements; There are also surveys handed out to Taobao consumers including the following parts:\n\n\u00b7The obstacles that you encounter while using the product.\n\n\u00b7Your advises and reviews of the product.\n\n\u00b7The frequencies of your uses on the product, or the importance of that particular product to the users themselves.\n\n\u00b7The satisfaction level towards the specific aspects, including visual and typographic layout, procedure and instruction guide.\n\n\u00b7The overall satisfaction level towards the product.\n\n=== Alipay ===\n{{main|Alipay}}\nLaunched in 2004, Alipay ({{zh|s=\u652f\u4ed8\u5b9d|t=\u652f\u4ed8\u5bf6|p=Zh\u012bf\u00f9b\u01ceo}}), an [[escrow]]-based [[online payment]] platform, is the preferred payment solution for transactions on Taobao Marketplace.

According to the Alibaba Group web site, Alipay is partnered with multiple financial institutions as well as Visa and MasterCard to facilitate payments in China and abroad.<ref name=\"Alibaba Group Company Overview\" />\n\nAlipay systems are separate for different groups of users. For instance, Alipay users may send and receive funds if they have an account that added a credit card issued in China, whereas users who use credit cards issued outside China may only use Alipay to pay for goods or services from Taobao.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294211-i642-k5228085-Recharge_a_China_Mobile_pre_pay_account_outside_of_China-China.html|title=Recharge a China Mobile pre-pay account outside of China? - China Forum - TripAdvisor|website=www.tripadvisor.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref> This has proven problematic for international users of Taobao, as they are unable to receive refunds that are not issued via the Taobao system.\n\nRegulatory changes issued by the People's Bank of China (Central Bank of China) are set to alter the Chinese online payment ecosystem forever.

Currently, over 2.4 million items have been sold on the platform.\n\n=== Happy Taobao ===\n\nIn Dec. 2009, Taobao, together with [[Hunan TV]], set up Happy Taobao, Inc for television shopping.

Since then, the volume of trading has set a new high every year.\n\n=== Developing Strategy ===\n\nOn March 29, 2016, the CEO of Alibaba group, [[Daniel Zhang]], pointed out the three directions of the future development goals for Taobao: more community-based, more content-enabled and local adapted in the 2016 annual customer conference held in Hangzhou.\nTaobao extensively uses shopping strategies such as data personalizing, customer loyalties, video broadcasting and the focused demand of a single community to build stages for sellers to display their commodities. It is strictly constructing a new ecosystem from content producing, to content propagating, and content consuming with Alibaba's cooperating internet platforms like Youku, Weibo, Alimama and Alifilms.\nExcept for using centralized and demand-matching supplies depending on the need of users to form a self-operational system of content producing and consuming transmission, Taobao also improved the quality of the commodity and its services towards the consumers.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Adaptive Agent ===\nTaobao applies a searching tool named 'adaptive agents'. An adaptive agent picks up the signals from consumers\u2019 purchase records, including categories, brands, functions and colors etc.; The search engine involves the scanning of a particular bar code. Taobao tracks customers' purchasing history and reorganize it into a series of selections that the buyers are likely to be attracted to. The way that an adaptive agent works is image prior models plus the posterior data using BAYES theory (LAPLACE method):\nThe possibility of the occurrence of a certain event can be estimated through the frequency of its occurrence in the past.\nThe ranking of a product or a page can be determined by the combination of its prior information plus its posterior data of click transaction.\n\nThe popularity of Taobao's searching model is based on the calculation of correlation rate and quality scores:\n*The static score of a product's title (correlation rate).\n*The matching score of the title and query of a product (correlation rate).\n*The category model of a product (correlation rate).\n*The transaction model of the commodity (quality score).\n*The sellers model (quality score).\n*The feedback (quality score).\n\nTaobao increased its traffic by launching an app.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Semantic Search ===\n\nTaobao automatically classifies the text and images of the product, and uses tags to make the correlation match. The usage of the semantic search is to solve the correlative problem that key word texts cannot solve, such as images, complex texts, and ambiguous texts. Semantic search is also a way of recommendation that Taobao presents with more similar items consumers might find when searching one keyword.

Online shoppers can use the site to compare prices from different sellers and identify products to buy.

Taobao users usually spend time to read feedback and compare items of one shop with those of others.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to read taobao shop feedbacks?\". NewBuyBay Taobao Agent. January 13, 2013|url=http://www.newbuybay.com/Article/ArtView/126}}</ref> Feedback put up by the user can be genuine or made up which users have to thoroughly read through to conclude. If the feedback style and tone is same, likely, it's made up. Some of the feedback can also be posted by competitors. Users have to look at the majority of the feedback to deduce whether the feedback are genuine. The best way to conclude whether the item is truly worth buying is to look at the available feedback that are posted by users after they've used the item for a period of time.\n\nFor every trade deal on Taobao, there must be a section of customer feedback, which is a determination factor of the sale volume for the shop. Therefore, the shop owners often put effort to maximize the positive comments and eliminate the negative ones.

According to the Alibaba Group web site, Alipay is partnered with multiple financial institutions as well as Visa and MasterCard to facilitate payments in China and abroad.<ref name=\"Alibaba Group Company Overview\" />\n\nAlipay systems are separate for different groups of users. For instance, Alipay users may send and receive funds if they have an account that added a credit card issued in China, whereas users who use credit cards issued outside China may only use Alipay to pay for goods or services from Taobao.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294211-i642-k5228085-Recharge_a_China_Mobile_pre_pay_account_outside_of_China-China.html|title=Recharge a China Mobile pre-pay account outside of China? - China Forum - TripAdvisor|website=www.tripadvisor.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref> This has proven problematic for international users of Taobao, as they are unable to receive refunds that are not issued via the Taobao system.\n\nRegulatory changes issued by the People's Bank of China (Central Bank of China) are set to alter the Chinese online payment ecosystem forever.

Since then, the volume of trading has set a new high every year.\n\n=== Developing Strategy ===\n\nOn March 29, 2016, the CEO of Alibaba group, [[Daniel Zhang]], pointed out the three directions of the future development goals for Taobao: more community-based, more content-enabled and local adapted in the 2016 annual customer conference held in Hangzhou.\nTaobao extensively uses shopping strategies such as data personalizing, customer loyalties, video broadcasting and the focused demand of a single community to build stages for sellers to display their commodities. It is strictly constructing a new ecosystem from content producing, to content propagating, and content consuming with Alibaba's cooperating internet platforms like Youku, Weibo, Alimama and Alifilms.\nExcept for using centralized and demand-matching supplies depending on the need of users to form a self-operational system of content producing and consuming transmission, Taobao also improved the quality of the commodity and its services towards the consumers.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Adaptive Agent ===\nTaobao applies a searching tool named 'adaptive agents'. An adaptive agent picks up the signals from consumers\u2019 purchase records, including categories, brands, functions and colors etc.; The search engine involves the scanning of a particular bar code. Taobao tracks customers' purchasing history and reorganize it into a series of selections that the buyers are likely to be attracted to. The way that an adaptive agent works is image prior models plus the posterior data using BAYES theory (LAPLACE method):\nThe possibility of the occurrence of a certain event can be estimated through the frequency of its occurrence in the past.\nThe ranking of a product or a page can be determined by the combination of its prior information plus its posterior data of click transaction.\n\nThe popularity of Taobao's searching model is based on the calculation of correlation rate and quality scores:\n*The static score of a product's title (correlation rate).\n*The matching score of the title and query of a product (correlation rate).\n*The category model of a product (correlation rate).\n*The transaction model of the commodity (quality score).\n*The sellers model (quality score).\n*The feedback (quality score).\n\nTaobao increased its traffic by launching an app.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Semantic Search ===\n\nTaobao automatically classifies the text and images of the product, and uses tags to make the correlation match. The usage of the semantic search is to solve the correlative problem that key word texts cannot solve, such as images, complex texts, and ambiguous texts.

After an extensive million-dollar renovation project, Central DuPage Hospital opened on September 16, 1964 with 113 beds and 66 physicians. The hospital saw much change throughout the 1970s, with the opening of a 120-bed pavilion on December 13, 1970, small additions in 1971 and 1972, and a five-story 112-bed patient tower in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nm.org/?id=9274|title=Northwestern Medicine|first=Northwestern|last=Medicine|website=Northwestern Medicine}}</ref>  The facility and campus continued to expand in the decades that followed, with much of the original structure eventually reused or demolished, culminating in the construction of a new $232 million five-story bed tower with 202 private rooms in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.construction-today.com/sections/focus/82-central-dupage-hospital|title=Central DuPage Hospital|website=Construction Today}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Central DuPage Health (the successor parent to the Central DuPage Hospital Association) merged with Delnor Health System, the parent of Delnor Hospital of Geneva, Illinois, to form Cadence Health System.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-transactions-and-valuation/illinois-central-dupage-delnor-merger-complete.html|title=Illinois' Central DuPage, Delnor Merger Complete|website=www.beckershospitalreview.com}}</ref>  Cadence, in turn, was then acquired by Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, parent of Chicago's [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]], in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140515/NEWS03/140519853/northwestern-memorial-healthcare-cadence-approve-merger|title=Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, Cadence approve merger|date=14 May 2014|website=Crain's Chicago Business}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and Rankings ==\n* 100 Top Hospitals by Truven Health Analytics (2006-2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015)<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cadencehealth.org/about-cadence-health/honors-awards|title=Honors and Awards {{!}} About Northwestern Medicine {{!}} Northwestern Medicine|website=Northwestern Medicine|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>\n* The LeapFrog Group Top Hospital (2014)<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n* Nationally Ranked for Orthopaedic Care by ''U.S. News & World Report'' (2009, 2012, 2013, 2014)<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n* Magnet Recognition For Nursing Excellence (2010)<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== Services ==\n* Community Health & Outreach\n* Diabetes Education\n* Diagnostic Imaging Services\n* Dialysis Services\n* Emergency & Trauma Services\n* Employee Assistance Program\n* Endoscopy Services\n* Fitness & Wellness Services\n* Home Health & Hospice Services\n* Infusion Services\n* Lab Services\n* Nutrition Services\n* Occupational Health Services\n* Pain Management Services\n* Rehabilitation Services\n* Senior Services\n* Surgical Services\n* Travel Medicine & Immunization Services\n* Walk-In Clinics\n* Wound Care Services\n\n== Primary Care Services ==\n* Northwestern Medicine Regional Medical Group\n* Family Medicine\n* Internal Medicine\n* Obstetrics & Gynecology\n* Pediatrics\n\n== Specialized Care ==\n* Behavioral Health \n* Northwestern Medicine Regional Medical Group\n* Cancer (Oncology)\n* Heart & Vascular \n* Neurosciences\n* Orthopedics\n* Palliative Medicine\n* Pediatric Specialty Care\n* Respiratory Health \n* Weight Management\n* Women's Health\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|1=http://www.cdh.org/}}\n\n[[Category:Hospitals in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in DuPage County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Winfield, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Companies based in DuPage County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Tuberculosis sanatoria in the United States]]\n[[Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1964]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1958]]\n[[Category:1964 establishments in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Hospitals established in 1964]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_DuPage_Hospital"}
