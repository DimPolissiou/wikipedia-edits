The region was traversed by a trail known as the Black Warrior's Path, which led from the [[Tennessee River]] near the present location of [[Florence, Alabama]], to a point on the [[Black Warrior River]] south of Cullman. This trail figured significantly in Cherokee history, and it featured prominently in the [[American Indian Wars]] prior to the establishment of the state of Alabama and the relocation of several American Indian tribes, including the [[Muscogee|Creek people]] westward along the [[Trail of Tears]]. During the [[Creek War]] in 1813, General [[Andrew Jackson]] of the U.S. Army dispatched a contingent of troops down the trail, one of which included the frontiersman [[Davy Crockett]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Fulenwider| first = Dan| url = http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history3.htm#blackwarrior| title = Cullman County, Alabama History: The Black Warrior's Path| work = Cullman County, Alabama| accessdate = January 28, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090927024240/http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history3.htm#blackwarrior| archive-date = September 27, 2009| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1820s and the 1830s, two toll roads were built linking the Tennessee Valley to present-day [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. In 1822, Abraham Stout was given a charter by the [[Alabama Legislature]] to open and turnpike a road beginning from Gandy's Cove in [[Morgan County, Alabama|Morgan County]] to the ghost town of Baltimore on the [[Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River|Mulberry Fork]] near [[Colony, Alabama|Colony]]. The road passed near present-day [[Vinemont, Alabama|Vinemont]] through Cullman, [[Good Hope, Alabama|Good Hope]], and down the current [[Interstate 65]] corridor to the Mulberry Fork. The road was later extended to [[Elyton, Alabama|Elyton]] (Birmingham) in 1827. It then became known as Stout's Road. Mace Thomas Payne Brindley was given a charter in 1833 to turnpike two roads, one running between [[Blount Springs, Alabama|Blount Springs]] to [[Somerville, Alabama|Somerville]] by way of his homestead in present-day [[Simcoe, Alabama|Simcoe]], and the second road passing west of [[Hanceville, Alabama|Hanceville]] and east of Downtown Cullman to join Stout's Road north of the city. What later became the Brindley Turnpike became an extension of Stout's Road to [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]]. Cullman later became located between the juncture of the two roads, and they predated the corridor of [[U.S. Route 31]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the future location of Cullman was the site of the minor [[Battle of Day's Gap]]. On April 30, 1863, [[Union Army|Union]] forces under the command of Colonel [[Abel Streight]] won a victory over forces under [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. This battle was part of a campaign and chase known collectively as Streight's Raid. Although Streight got the upper hand in this battle, Forrest would have the last laugh. In one of the more humorous moments of the war, Streight sought a truce and negotiations with Forrest in present-day [[Cherokee County, Alabama|Cherokee County]] near present-day [[Gaylesville, Alabama|Gaylesville]]. Although Streight's force was larger than Forrest's, while the two were negotiating, Forrest had his troops march repeatedly in a circuitous route past the site of the talks. Thinking himself to be badly outnumbered, Streight surrendered to Forrest .<ref>{{cite web\n |last         = Partain\n |first        = Rich\n |url          = http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history2.htm\n |title        = Streight's Raid\n |work         = co.cullman.al.us\n |accessdate   = January 28, 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090927022749/http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history2.htm\n |archive-date = September 27, 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Col. John Cullmann.jpg|left|thumb|Colonel John G. Cullmann, founder of Cullman (1823\u20131895)]]\nCullman itself was founded in 1873 by Colonel [[John G. Cullmann]], a German immigrant.<ref>Although some sources state that Cullmann had earlier Americanized his name from \"Kullmann,\" Stanley Johnson, his only surviving American descendant, told ''The Cullman Times'' in 1998 that there are no German records indicating the name \"Kullmann\", and that \"Cullmann\" had always been the correct spelling. {{Cite news |title=Cullman: Moving Forward while Treasuring the Past |periodical=The Cullman Times |year=1998}}</ref> Cullmann had been an advocate of democratic reforms in his native [[Bavaria]], having fought and acquired his honorific title \"Colonel\" during the [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|Revolutions of 1848\u201349]]. After the failure of the revolution, Cullmann found himself in financial ruin. In the years to follow, he would try to re-establish himself in business, but after several setbacks, including a great financial loss in the [[First Schleswig War]], he would remain unsuccessful. As time went on and [[Prussia]], under [[William I, German Emperor|King Wilhelm I]] and his Minister President [[Otto von Bismarck]], began to exert more influence in the German region (eventually [[Unification of Germany|unifying Germany under Prussian rule]] in 1871), Cullmann began to believe that his political ideals were fundamentally incompatible with those of the German Government. As a result, he decided to emigrate from his homeland. Settling first in London due to fears that he would be forced to join in the ongoing [[American Civil War]], Cullman eventually came to America in 1865. He moved to Alabama in 1871 and, in 1873, negotiated an agreement to act as agent for a tract of land {{convert|349000|acre|km2}} in size, owned by the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] Company, on which he established a colony for German immigrants.<ref name=\"founding\">{{cite web\n |last=Johnson \n |first=Stanley \n |url=http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history1.htm \n |title=Founding of Cullman \n |work=co.cullman.al.us \n |accessdate=January 28, 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428001839/http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history1.htm \n |archivedate=April 28, 2009 \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Northern Alabama: Historical and Biographical | url=https://archive.org/details/northernalabamah00birm | year=1888 | place=Birmingham | publisher=Smith & Deland}}</ref>\n\nFive German families moved to the area in March 1873; in 1874, the town was incorporated and named after Colonel Cullmann (with the town name being Americanized to 'Cullman' with one 'n'). Over the next twenty years, Cullmann encouraged around 100,000 Germans to immigrate to the United States, with many settling in the Cullman area. Cullmann drew on his military engineering training in laying out and planning the town. During this period, Cullman underwent considerable growth. [[German language|German]] continued to be widely spoken, and Cullmann himself was the publisher of a German-language newspaper. When Cullmann died in 1895, at the age of 72, his funeral was marked by the attendance of Governor [[William C.

The region was traversed by a trail known as the Black Warrior's Path, which led from the [[Tennessee River]] near the present location of [[Florence, Alabama]], to a point on the [[Black Warrior River]] south of Cullman. This trail figured significantly in Cherokee history, and it featured prominently in the [[American Indian Wars]] prior to the establishment of the state of Alabama and the relocation of several American Indian tribes, including the [[Muscogee|Creek people]] westward along the [[Trail of Tears]]. During the [[Creek War]] in 1813, General [[Andrew Jackson]] of the U.S. Army dispatched a contingent of troops down the trail, one of which included the frontiersman [[Davy Crockett]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Fulenwider| first = Dan| url = http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history3.htm#blackwarrior| title = Cullman County, Alabama History: The Black Warrior's Path| work = Cullman County, Alabama| accessdate = January 28, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090927024240/http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history3.htm#blackwarrior| archive-date = September 27, 2009| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1820s and the 1830s, two toll roads were built linking the Tennessee Valley to present-day [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. In 1822, Abraham Stout was given a charter by the [[Alabama Legislature]] to open and turnpike a road beginning from Gandy's Cove in [[Morgan County, Alabama|Morgan County]] to the ghost town of Baltimore on the [[Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River|Mulberry Fork]] near [[Colony, Alabama|Colony]]. The road passed near present-day [[Vinemont, Alabama|Vinemont]] through Cullman, [[Good Hope, Alabama|Good Hope]], and down the current [[Interstate 65]] corridor to the Mulberry Fork. The road was later extended to [[Elyton, Alabama|Elyton]] (Birmingham) in 1827. It then became known as Stout's Road. Mace Thomas Payne Brindley was given a charter in 1833 to turnpike two roads, one running between [[Blount Springs, Alabama|Blount Springs]] to [[Somerville, Alabama|Somerville]] by way of his homestead in present-day [[Simcoe, Alabama|Simcoe]], and the second road passing west of [[Hanceville, Alabama|Hanceville]] and east of Downtown Cullman to join Stout's Road north of the city. What later became the Brindley Turnpike became an extension of Stout's Road to [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]]. Cullman later became located between the juncture of the two roads, and they predated the corridor of [[U.S. Route 31]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the future location of Cullman was the site of the minor [[Battle of Day's Gap]]. On April 30, 1863, [[Union Army|Union]] forces under the command of Colonel [[Abel Streight]] won a victory over forces under [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. This battle was part of a campaign and chase known collectively as Streight's Raid. Although Streight got the upper hand in this battle, Forrest would have the last laugh. In one of the more humorous moments of the war, Streight sought a truce and negotiations with Forrest in present-day [[Cherokee County, Alabama|Cherokee County]] near present-day [[Gaylesville, Alabama|Gaylesville]]. Although Streight's force was larger than Forrest's, while the two were negotiating, Forrest had his troops march repeatedly in a circuitous route past the site of the talks. Thinking himself to be badly outnumbered, Streight surrendered to Forrest .<ref>{{cite web\n |last         = Partain\n |first        = Rich\n |url          = http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history2.htm\n |title        = Streight's Raid\n |work         = co.cullman.al.us\n |accessdate   = January 28, 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090927022749/http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history2.htm\n |archive-date = September 27, 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Col.

After the failure of the revolution, Cullmann found himself in financial ruin. In the years to follow, he would try to re-establish himself in business, but after several setbacks, including a great financial loss in the [[First Schleswig War]], he would remain unsuccessful. As time went on and [[Prussia]], under [[William I, German Emperor|King Wilhelm I]] and his Minister President [[Otto von Bismarck]], began to exert more influence in the German region (eventually [[Unification of Germany|unifying Germany under Prussian rule]] in 1871), Cullmann began to believe that his political ideals were fundamentally incompatible with those of the German Government. As a result, he decided to emigrate from his homeland. Settling first in London due to fears that he would be forced to join in the ongoing [[American Civil War]], Cullman eventually came to America in 1865. He moved to Alabama in 1871 and, in 1873, negotiated an agreement to act as agent for a tract of land {{convert|349000|acre|km2}} in size, owned by the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] Company, on which he established a colony for German immigrants.<ref name=\"founding\">{{cite web\n |last=Johnson \n |first=Stanley \n |url=http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history1.htm \n |title=Founding of Cullman \n |work=co.cullman.al.us \n |accessdate=January 28, 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428001839/http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history1.htm \n |archivedate=April 28, 2009 \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Northern Alabama: Historical and Biographical | url=https://archive.org/details/northernalabamah00birm | year=1888 | place=Birmingham | publisher=Smith & Deland}}</ref>\n\nFive German families moved to the area in March 1873; in 1874, the town was incorporated and named after Colonel Cullmann (with the town name being Americanized to 'Cullman' with one 'n'). Over the next twenty years, Cullmann encouraged around 100,000 Germans to immigrate to the United States, with many settling in the Cullman area. Cullmann drew on his military engineering training in laying out and planning the town. During this period, Cullman underwent considerable growth. [[German language|German]] continued to be widely spoken, and Cullmann himself was the publisher of a German-language newspaper. When Cullmann died in 1895, at the age of 72, his funeral was marked by the attendance of Governor [[William C.

They are the procedure most likely to detect early breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Mammograms can show tumors long before they are large enough to palpate. They are recommended for women who have symptoms of breast cancer or who are at increased risk of developing the disease. They are performed with the patient standing, the breast pressed between two plastic plates, as the image is taken. The interpretation has to be performed by a specialist.<ref name=Mmmography>{{Cite web|url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mammography.html|title=Mammography |website= Medline Plus|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health|accessdate=2013-04-22 }}</ref>\n\nBreast ultrasound is a complementary study of mammography. In many women the tissue that makes up the breast is very dense, representing fibrous tissue and glandular tissue, which produces milk during lactation. This limits the radiologist interpreting the study, so, in these cases, the ultrasound is helpful, since this is capable of distinguishing tumors in women with dense breast tissue, where identification is otherwise difficult. Additionally, it is advisable to follow up a mammogram that shows indications of tumors with an ultrasound, to confirm, before more invasive procedures are undertaken.<ref name=Ultrasonido>{{Cite web|url= http://www.fucam.org.mx/index.php/servicios/ultrasonido-mamario|title=Ultrasonido mamario |work= FUCAM|accessdate=2013-04-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Pelvic exam==\nThe [https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pelvic-exam/about/pac-20385135?p=1 pelvic exam] is part of the physical examination of the pelvic area of a woman, which generally also includes the taking of a sample for a pap smear.

The external genitalia is examined first, looking for abnormalities like lesions, ulcers, warts and color changes. The elements of this exam include the vulva, which contains the mons pubis, of which there are two longitudinal folds of skin forming the labia majora; then the labia minora and hair follicles. The clitoral hood is also checked.<ref name=Anatomia/>\n\n===Bimanual exam===\nThe purpose of this exam is to palpate organs which cannot be seen with visual inspection. The index and middle finger are inserted into the vagina. This maneuver allows the doctor to check the orientation, length and width of the vagina. Next, the cervix and vaginal fornices are palpated, to check position, size, consistency, mobility and sensibility.<ref name=Examen>{{cite web |url= http://escuela.med.puc.cl/Publ/ManualSemiologia/Ginecolo.html|title=Examen ginecol\u00f3gico  |work= Manual de Semiolog\u00eda |accessdate=2013-04-19 }}</ref> The other hand is placed in the pubis pressing it to feel the uterus between both hands.

The first step is to open the vaginal opening with two fingers at the vulvo-perineal angle, then separate the fingers slightly and press down, then insert the speculum arranging the width of the tip of the flaps in anteroposterior. Then the speculum is moved into the vagina at an angle of 45\u00b0, following the natural contour of the posterior vaginal wall. When the speculum is in place, the fingers are removed and the device is rotated so that the flaps are horizontal. The flaps are then separated and locked into place when the cervical neck is completely visible.<ref name=tecnica/>\n\n==Pap smear==\nThe pap smear is a screening test to test for abnormalities such as cervical cancer and human papillomavirus infections, which require early treatment.

If a woman finds a lump or notice any changes in her breast, she should seek medical attention promptly.<ref name=Autoexamen>{{cite web|url= http://www.permanente.net/homepage/kaiser/pdf/6293.pdf|title=Autoexamen de los senos |work= Kaiser permanent|accessdate=2013-04-22 }}</ref><ref name=Autoexamen/>\n\n===Further examination of the breasts===\nA mammogram or mammography is a special x-ray of the breasts. They are the procedure most likely to detect early breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Mammograms can show tumors long before they are large enough to palpate. They are recommended for women who have symptoms of breast cancer or who are at increased risk of developing the disease. They are performed with the patient standing, the breast pressed between two plastic plates, as the image is taken. The interpretation has to be performed by a specialist.<ref name=Mmmography>{{Cite web|url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mammography.html|title=Mammography |website= Medline Plus|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health|accessdate=2013-04-22 }}</ref>\n\nBreast ultrasound is a complementary study of mammography. In many women the tissue that makes up the breast is very dense, representing fibrous tissue and glandular tissue, which produces milk during lactation. This limits the radiologist interpreting the study, so, in these cases, the ultrasound is helpful, since this is capable of distinguishing tumors in women with dense breast tissue, where identification is otherwise difficult. Additionally, it is advisable to follow up a mammogram that shows indications of tumors with an ultrasound, to confirm, before more invasive procedures are undertaken.<ref name=Ultrasonido>{{Cite web|url= http://www.fucam.org.mx/index.php/servicios/ultrasonido-mamario|title=Ultrasonido mamario |work= FUCAM|accessdate=2013-04-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Pelvic exam==\nThe [https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pelvic-exam/about/pac-20385135?p=1 pelvic exam] is part of the physical examination of the pelvic area of a woman, which generally also includes the taking of a sample for a pap smear. This test includes three parts. These are the general inspection of the external genitalia, bimanual examination, and inspection of the vaginal canal using a speculum.<ref name=Anatomia>{{cite journal |vauthors=Parrondo P, P\u00e9rez-Medina T, \u00c1lvarez-Heros J |title = Anatom\u00eda del aparato genital femenino|journal = Salud Mujer|pages = 15\u201318 |date=April 2013 |url = http://www2.univadis.net/microsites/area_salud_mujer/pdfs/1-Anatomia_del_aparto_genital_femenino.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Inspection of external female genitalia ===\nThe patient is placed in a supine position on a special examination table, which has two protrusions called \"stirrups.\" With the feet in these stirrups, the legs are placed in a position such that the medical professional can access the pelvic area. The external genitalia is examined first, looking for abnormalities like lesions, ulcers, warts and color changes. The elements of this exam include the vulva, which contains the mons pubis, of which there are two longitudinal folds of skin forming the labia majora; then the labia minora and hair follicles. The clitoral hood is also checked.<ref name=Anatomia/>\n\n===Bimanual exam===\nThe purpose of this exam is to palpate organs which cannot be seen with visual inspection. The index and middle finger are inserted into the vagina. This maneuver allows the doctor to check the orientation, length and width of the vagina. Next, the cervix and vaginal fornices are palpated, to check position, size, consistency, mobility and sensibility.<ref name=Examen>{{cite web |url= http://escuela.med.puc.cl/Publ/ManualSemiologia/Ginecolo.html|title=Examen ginecol\u00f3gico  |work= Manual de Semiolog\u00eda |accessdate=2013-04-19 }}</ref> The other hand is placed in the pubis pressing it to feel the uterus between both hands. The most important characteristics to examine are the size of the uterus, presence of nodes or agglomerations, consistency, size, tilt, and mobility.

Its purpose is to separate and widen the vaginal opening and keep it open. This allows direct observation by the physician into the vaginal canal with the help of a lamp or a mirror.<ref name=tecnica>{{Cite web|url= http://www.polgalvan.sld.cu/softw_apn/contenido/tecnicaespeculo.htm|title=T\u00e9cnica de colocaci\u00f3n del es\u00e9culo |work= Omar Morera |accessdate=2013-04-18 }}</ref>\n\nThere are different types of speculums used within the different characteristics of each patient such as age, sex life, and other factors. The first step is to open the vaginal opening with two fingers at the vulvo-perineal angle, then separate the fingers slightly and press down, then insert the speculum arranging the width of the tip of the flaps in anteroposterior. Then the speculum is moved into the vagina at an angle of 45\u00b0, following the natural contour of the posterior vaginal wall. When the speculum is in place, the fingers are removed and the device is rotated so that the flaps are horizontal. The flaps are then separated and locked into place when the cervical neck is completely visible.<ref name=tecnica/>\n\n==Pap smear==\nThe pap smear is a screening test to test for abnormalities such as cervical cancer and human papillomavirus infections, which require early treatment. To be viable, the patient should not be menstruating and had not used a vaginal contraceptive in the prior 24\u201348 hours.<ref name=pelvico>{{cite journal | author = Klein S., Miller S., Thomson F002E| title = El examen p\u00e9lvico| journal = Atenci\u00f3n del embarazo, el parto y la salud de la mujer| pages = 373\u2013387 |date=May 2000 | url = http://hesperian.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/es_midw_2011/es_midw_2011_Cap20.pdf}}</ref> The procedure begins with the scraping of cells from the cervix and the uterine fornix, done during the speculum examination as there is access to the cervix. The scraping is done with a spatula, cervical brush or swab. Some women experience temporary bleeding from this procedure. The scrapings are placed on a slide, covered with a fixative for later examination under a microscope to determine if they are normal or abnormal.<ref name=pelvico/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Medical procedures]]\n[[Category:Women's health in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "HiGyn", "label": "safe", "comment": "removed sentence in lead that did not have citation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-woman_examination"}

However, some newer [[radio-controlled helicopter|model helicopter]]s remove this mechanically complex separation of functionalities by using three interdependent actuators that can each move the entire swashplate.
