The next sultan, his grandson Ahmad Shah I founded the new capital [[Ahmedabad]] in 1411. His successor [[Muhammad Shah II]] subdued most of the Rajput chieftains. The prosperity of the sultanate reached its zenith during the rule of [[Mahmud Begada]]. He subdued most of the Rajput chieftains and built navy off the coast of [[Diu, India|Diu]].

In 1391, Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Muhammad bin Tughluq appointed Zafar Khan, the son of Wajih-ul-Mulk as governor of Gujarat and conferred him the title of Muzaffar Khan (r. 1391 - 1403, 1404 - 1411).

The amount of tribute paid by the different chiefs depended, not on the value of their territory, but on the terms granted to them when they agreed to become feudatories of the king. This tribute was occasionally collected by military expeditions headed by the king in person and called ''mulkg\u00edri'' or country-seizing circuits.<ref name=\"GBP\">{{cite book|editor=[[James Macnabb Campbell]]|title=History of Gujar\u00e1t|chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/54652/54652-h/54652-h.htm|series=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|volume=Volume I.

Justice was administered and the revenue collected in the same way as under the [[Chaulukya]] kings. The revenue consisted, as before, of a share of the crops received in kind, supplemented by the levy of special cesses, trade, and transit dues. The chief's share of the crops differed according to the locality; it rarely exceeded one-third of the produce, it rarely fell short of one-sixth. From some parts the chief's share was realised directly from the cultivator by agents called ''mantri''s; from other parts the collection was through superior landowners.<ref name=\"GBP\"/>\n\n;Districts and crown lands\nThe \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d kings divided the portion of their territory which was under their direct authority into districts or ''sark\u00e1r''s. These districts were administered in one of two ways. They were either assigned to nobles in support of a contingent of troops, or they were set apart as crown domains and managed by paid officers. The officers placed in charge of districts set apart as crown domains were called ''mukti\u0103''. Their chief duties were to preserve the peace and to collect the revenue. For the maintenance of order, a body of soldiers from the army headquarters at \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d was detached for service in each of these divisions, and placed under the command of the district governor. At the same time, in addition to the presence of this detachment of regular troops, every district contained certain fortified outposts called ''th\u00e1n\u00e1''s, varying in number according to the character of the country and the temper of the people. These posts were in charge of officers called ''th\u00e1nad\u00e1r''s subordinate to the district governor. They were garrisoned by bodies of local soldiery, for whose maintenance, in addition to money payments, a small assignment of land was set apart in the neighbourhood of the post. On the arrival of the tribute-collecting army the governors of the districts through which it passed were expected to join the main body with their local contingents. At other times the district governors had little control over the feudatory chiefs in the neighbourhood of their charge.<ref name=\"GBP\"/> The Gujarat Sultanate had comprised twenty-five ''sarkar''s (administrative units).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Eighteenth-century Gujarat : the dynamics of its political economy, 1750-1800|last=A.|first=Nadri, Ghulam|date=2009|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004172029|location=Leiden|pages=10|oclc=568402132}}</ref>\n\n;Fiscal\nFor fiscal purposes each district or sark\u00e1r was distributed among a certain number of sub-divisions or ''pargan\u00e1h''s, each under a paid official styled ''\u00e1mil'' or ''tahsild\u00e1r''. These sub-divisional officers realised the state demand, nominally one-half of the produce, by the help of the headmen of the villages under their charge. In the sharehold and simple villages of North Gujar\u00e1t these village headmen were styled ''[[Patel]]''s or according to Muslim writers ''mukaddam''s and in the simple villages of the south they were known as ''[[Desai]]''s. They arranged for the final distribution of the total demand in joint villages among the shareholders, and in simple villages from the individual cultivators. The sub-divisional officer presented a statement of the accounts of the villages in his sub-division to the district officer, whose record of the revenue of his whole district was in turn forwarded to the head revenue officer at court. As a check on the internal management of his charge, and especially to help him in the work of collecting the revenue, with each district governor was associated an accountant. Further that each of these officers might be the greater check on the other, Ahmad Shah I enforced the rule that when the governor was chosen from among the royal slaves the accountant should be a free man, and that when the accountant was a slave the district governor should be chosen from some other class. This practise was maintained till the end of the reign of Muzaffar Sh\u00e1h II, when, according to the ''Mir\u0103t-i-\u00c1hmedi'', the army became much increased, and the ministers, condensing the details of revenue, farmed it on contract, so that many parts formerly yielding one rupee now produced ten, and many others seven eight or nine, and in no place was there a less increase than from ten to twenty per cent. Many other changes occurred at the same time, and the spirit of innovation creeping into the administration the wholesome system of checking the accounts was given up and mutiny and confusion spread over Gujar\u00e1t.<ref name=\"GBP\"/>\n\n==Sources of history==\n''Mirat-i-Sikandari'' is a Persian work on the complete history of Gujarat Sultanate written by Sikandar, son of Muhammad aka Manjhu, son of Akbar who wrote it soon after Akbar conquered Gujarat.

The next sultan, his grandson Ahmad Shah I founded the new capital [[Ahmedabad]] in 1411. His successor [[Muhammad Shah II]] subdued most of the Rajput chieftains. The prosperity of the sultanate reached its zenith during the rule of [[Mahmud Begada]]. He subdued most of the Rajput chieftains and built navy off the coast of [[Diu, India|Diu]].

The amount of tribute paid by the different chiefs depended, not on the value of their territory, but on the terms granted to them when they agreed to become feudatories of the king. This tribute was occasionally collected by military expeditions headed by the king in person and called ''mulkg\u00edri'' or country-seizing circuits.<ref name=\"GBP\">{{cite book|editor=[[James Macnabb Campbell]]|title=History of Gujar\u00e1t|chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/54652/54652-h/54652-h.htm|series=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|volume=Volume I.

Justice was administered and the revenue collected in the same way as under the [[Chaulukya]] kings. The revenue consisted, as before, of a share of the crops received in kind, supplemented by the levy of special cesses, trade, and transit dues. The chief's share of the crops differed according to the locality; it rarely exceeded one-third of the produce, it rarely fell short of one-sixth. From some parts the chief's share was realised directly from the cultivator by agents called ''mantri''s; from other parts the collection was through superior landowners.<ref name=\"GBP\"/>\n\n;Districts and crown lands\nThe \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d kings divided the portion of their territory which was under their direct authority into districts or ''sark\u00e1r''s. These districts were administered in one of two ways. They were either assigned to nobles in support of a contingent of troops, or they were set apart as crown domains and managed by paid officers. The officers placed in charge of districts set apart as crown domains were called ''mukti\u0103''. Their chief duties were to preserve the peace and to collect the revenue. For the maintenance of order, a body of soldiers from the army headquarters at \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d was detached for service in each of these divisions, and placed under the command of the district governor. At the same time, in addition to the presence of this detachment of regular troops, every district contained certain fortified outposts called ''th\u00e1n\u00e1''s, varying in number according to the character of the country and the temper of the people. These posts were in charge of officers called ''th\u00e1nad\u00e1r''s subordinate to the district governor. They were garrisoned by bodies of local soldiery, for whose maintenance, in addition to money payments, a small assignment of land was set apart in the neighbourhood of the post. On the arrival of the tribute-collecting army the governors of the districts through which it passed were expected to join the main body with their local contingents. At other times the district governors had little control over the feudatory chiefs in the neighbourhood of their charge.<ref name=\"GBP\"/> The Gujarat Sultanate had comprised twenty-five ''sarkar''s (administrative units).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Eighteenth-century Gujarat : the dynamics of its political economy, 1750-1800|last=A.|first=Nadri, Ghulam|date=2009|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004172029|location=Leiden|pages=10|oclc=568402132}}</ref>\n\n;Fiscal\nFor fiscal purposes each district or sark\u00e1r was distributed among a certain number of sub-divisions or ''pargan\u00e1h''s, each under a paid official styled ''\u00e1mil'' or ''tahsild\u00e1r''. These sub-divisional officers realised the state demand, nominally one-half of the produce, by the help of the headmen of the villages under their charge. In the sharehold and simple villages of North Gujar\u00e1t these village headmen were styled ''[[Patel]]''s or according to Muslim writers ''mukaddam''s and in the simple villages of the south they were known as ''[[Desai]]''s. They arranged for the final distribution of the total demand in joint villages among the shareholders, and in simple villages from the individual cultivators. The sub-divisional officer presented a statement of the accounts of the villages in his sub-division to the district officer, whose record of the revenue of his whole district was in turn forwarded to the head revenue officer at court. As a check on the internal management of his charge, and especially to help him in the work of collecting the revenue, with each district governor was associated an accountant. Further that each of these officers might be the greater check on the other, Ahmad Shah I enforced the rule that when the governor was chosen from among the royal slaves the accountant should be a free man, and that when the accountant was a slave the district governor should be chosen from some other class. This practise was maintained till the end of the reign of Muzaffar Sh\u00e1h II, when, according to the ''Mir\u0103t-i-\u00c1hmedi'', the army became much increased, and the ministers, condensing the details of revenue, farmed it on contract, so that many parts formerly yielding one rupee now produced ten, and many others seven eight or nine, and in no place was there a less increase than from ten to twenty per cent. Many other changes occurred at the same time, and the spirit of innovation creeping into the administration the wholesome system of checking the accounts was given up and mutiny and confusion spread over Gujar\u00e1t.<ref name=\"GBP\"/>\n\n==Sources of history==\n''Mirat-i-Sikandari'' is a Persian work on the complete history of Gujarat Sultanate written by Sikandar, son of Muhammad aka Manjhu, son of Akbar who wrote it soon after Akbar conquered Gujarat.

It was aired on April 22, 2013. The episode was written by [[Kevin Murphy (screenwriter)|Kevin Murphy]] & Anupam Nigam. It was directed by [[Michael Nankin]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nElah Bandik (Robert Clarke), the Castithan who fled the battle in the pilot episode, is accused of cowardice by Datak Tarr ([[Tony Curran]]) and must undergo a \"cleansing\" ceremony which is actually ritual torture and execution. Nolan ([[Grant Bowler]]) and Irisa ([[Stephanie Leonidas]]) intervene and stop the ceremony, but Amanda ([[Julie Benz]]) allows the ritual to continue, citing a previous incident in which many Irathient were killed and those remaining left Defiance.\n\nRafe McCawley ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]) is displeased with his daughter Christie's ([[Nicole Mu\u00f1oz]]) engagement to Alak Tarr ([[Jesse Rath]]); he asks her to call off the wedding.  Christie seems to have second thoughts; however, Stahma Tarr ([[Jaime Murray]]) intervenes, meeting Christie at the diner where she works and changing her mind.\n\nMeanwhile, Birch (Steven McCarthy) and Nicky ([[Fionnula Flanagan]]), continue with their plan; Birch releases Ben (Douglas Nyback) from his restraints at the hospital and forces him to try another approach. Ben triggers an explosion at the McCawley Mines, trapping himself in a shaft leading deep underground. Rafe McCawley leads Nolan through a series of caverns called \"The Rat's Nest\", meeting up with the blocked shaft in the ruins of Old St. Louis. They find Ben attempting to blow up a nuclear power plant. Ben is captured and the bomb is deactivated; Nolan talks Rafe out of killing Ben in revenge for Luke's (Wesley French) death. Ben tells Rafe that Luke was trying to earn money to leave Defiance and his father by helping him, because Luke hated Rafe for what he had done to his mother.<!-- No idea who did it? --> Ben then throws himself on McCawley's gun and pulls the trigger.\n\nIn Nolan's absence, Irisa is incensed by the torture ritual and rescues Elah Bandik.  With the help of Tommy (Dewshane Williams), a Deputy Lawkeeper, she arrests Elah as a means of providing protection for him. Datak is furious and tries to retrieve him; Amanda, Nolan and Rafe arrive just in time to prevent further violence and Datak appears to give in.\n\nA memorial service is held for those who died defending the town from the Volge. Rafe tries to mourn, but he is struggling to comprehend Ben's final words regarding Luke. He searches Luke's room, discovering maps, a pile of [[scrip]], and a strange gold object.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Elah Bandik has one last meal with his family, then departs with Datak. Elah is subsequently found dead in front of the lawkeeper's office.\n\n== Feature music ==\nIn the \"Down In the Ground Where the Dead Men Go\" we can hear the songs:<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://heardontv.com/tvshow/Defiance/Season+1/Down+in+the+Ground+Where+the+Dead+Men+Go|title = Down In the Ground Where the Dead Men Go - Music|date = |accessdate = June 21, 2014|website = |publisher = Heard on TV|last = |first = }}</ref>\n* \"Come As You Are\" by [[Civil Twilight (band)|Civil Twilight]]\n* \"Tag und Nacht (Night and Day)\" by [[Comedian Harmonists]]\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Down In the Ground Where the Dead Men Go\" was watched by 2.40&nbsp;million; down 0.33  from the previous episode.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/04/23/monday-cable-ratings-love-and-hip-hop-atlanta-wins-night-wwe-raw-teen-mom-ii-nba-playoffs-more/179186/ |title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta' Wins Night + WWE Raw, 'Teen Mom II', NBA Playoffs & More |work=TV by the Numbers |last=Kondolojy |first=Amanda |date=April 23, 2013 |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Reviews===\nThe reviews for \"Down In the Ground Where the Dead Men Go\" were mediocre.\n\nJosh Jackson from ''Paste magazine'' rated the episode with 7.5/10 saying that the episode was not flawless but it was promising. \"It\u2019s not a flawless second episode but it is a promising one.

{"title_page": "History of lighthouses", "text_new": "[[Image:A coruna torre de hercules sunset edit.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Tower of Hercules]], a Roman lighthouse at [[A Coru\u00f1a]] modelled on the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]]]]\nThe '''history of lighthouses''' refers to the development of the use of towers, buildings, or other types of structure, as an aid to navigation for maritime pilots at seas or on inland waterways.\n\n==Premodern era==\nBefore the development of clearly defined ports, mariners were guided by fires built on hilltops. Since raising the fire would improve the visibility, placing the fire on a platform became a practice that led to the development of the lighthouse. In antiquity, the lighthouse functioned more as an entrance marker to ports than as a warning signal for reefs and promontories, unlike many modern lighthouses.\n\n===Greek-Roman period===\n[[Image:PHAROS2006.jpg|thumb|Graphic reconstruction of the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] according to a 2006 study.]]\nAccording to [[Homer]]ic legend, [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]] of [[Nafplio]] invented the first lighthouse, although they are certainly attested with the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (designed and constructed by [[Sostratus of Cnidus]]) and the [[Colossus of Rhodes]]. However, [[Themistocles]] had earlier established a lighthouse at the harbor of [[Piraeus]] connected to Athens in the 5th century BC, essentially a small stone column with a fire beacon.<ref>Elinor Dewire and Dolores Reyes-Pergioudakis (2010). ''The Lighthouses of Greece''. Sarasota: Pineapple Press. {{ISBN|978-1-56164-452-0}}, pp 1-5.</ref>\n\nWritten descriptions and drawings of the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] of [[Alexandria]] provide information about lighthouses, but the tower itself collapsed during an earthquake many centuries after its construction in the 3rd century BC by the Greeks. The intact [[Tower of Hercules]] at [[A Coru\u00f1a]] and the ruins of the [[Dubris|Dover]] lighthouse in England give insight into construction; other evidence about lighthouses exists in depictions on coins and mosaics, of which many represent the lighthouse at [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]]. Coins from Alexandria, Ostia, and [[Latakia|Laodicea in Syria]] also exist.\n\nWhile the evidence provides insight into the exterior structure of these structures, there are many gaps in evidence concerning less visible aspects of the structures. The remains at [[A Coru\u00f1a]] and [[Dover]] help determine how each lighthouse structure functioned, though one must make some assumptions to determine how the structures [[beacon]]s were illuminated. Presumably locally available fuels will have included wood and probably coal to keep a fire going continuously during the night, and there is a large chimney leading to the top room at the [[Tower of Hercules]]. The example from Dover has been converted at some stage into a simple [[watchtower]].\n\n[[Image:DoverCastle-lighthouse-2004-10-03.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Roman lighthouse at [[Dover Castle]]]]\nLighthouse keepers may have added combustible liquids to reduce the expenditure on fuel and keep the light steady during [[gale]]s, but little information exists in the literature from the time. It may also be possible that the light was protected from the wind by glass windows, and large mirrors may have assisted in projecting the light beam as far as possible. It is likely that lighthouses would have required considerable labour for transporting the fuel and maintaining the flame. At [[Cape Hatteras]] in the 1870s, one keeper and two assistants kept themselves busy by tending more sophisticated flames from powerful oil lamps.\n\nWhile artistic representations assist us in re-creating a visual image of lighthouses, they present many problems. Depictions of lighthouses on [[Roman coins]], [[inscriptions]], carvings, and [[mosaic]]s present an inconsistent view of the actual appearances of the structures. Most show a building with two or three stories that decreases in width as it ascends. The limited size of coins could cause the producer of the coin to alter the image to fit on the surface. The similarity in depictions of lighthouses is symbolic rather than accurate representations of specific beacons.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Cordouanchastillon.jpg|thumb|200px|Engraving of the Cordouan tower completed in 1611]]\nDuring the middle age times, Roman lighthouses fell into disuse, but some remained functional, such as the Farum Brigantium, now known as the [[Tower of Hercules]], in A Coru\u00f1a, Spain, and others in the Mediterranean Sea such as the [[Lighthouse of Genoa|Lanterna]] at [[Genoa]]. As navigation improved, lighthouses gradually expanded into Western and Northern Europe.<ref name=\"Crompton\">Crompton, Samuel, W; Rhein, Michael, J. ''The Ultimate Book of Lighthouses''. San Diego, CA: Thunder Bay Press, 2002. {{ISBN|1-59223-102-0}}</ref> One of the oldest working lighthouses in Europe is [[Hook Lighthouse]] located at Hook Head in County Wexford, Ireland. It was built during the medieval period, in a sturdy \u2013circular design.\n\nA century later, in the [[Late Middle Ages]], a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} tower was built by [[Edward the Black Prince]] at [[Cordouan lighthouse|Cordouan]] near the [[Gironde estuary]]. One hundred years later, in 1581, [[Henri III]] asked architect Louis de Foix to build a new one.<ref name=\"beaver\">{{cite book|last=Beaver|first=Patrick|title=A History of Lighthouses|publisher=London: Peter Davies Ltd|year=1971|isbn=0-432-01290-7|page=17}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Stevenson|first=D.

The tiered Cordouan symbolized French maritime power and prestige. The interior had sumptuous king's apartments, decorated pillars and murals.

The abuse of these licenses led to foreign ships fearing to seek refuge on the south coast of England for fear of being boarded with demands, and to the loss of a number of ships, most notably the Dutch merchant ship Vreede in 1800 with the loss of 380 lives.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hague|first1=Douglas B|last2= Christie |first2=Rosemary|title=Lighthouses: Their Architecture, History and Archeology|year=1975|publisher=Gomer Press|location=Dyfed, Wales|page=44|ref=harv}}</ref> \n\nWith the increasing number of ships lost along the [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to London coal route, [[Trinity House]] established the [[Lowestoft Lighthouse]] in 1609, a pair of wooden towers with candle illuminants. Until the late 18th century, candle, coal, or wood fires were used as lighthouse illuminants, improved in 1782 with the circular-wick oil-burning [[Argand lamp]], the first \u2018catoptric\u2019 mirrored reflector in 1777, and [[Fresnel]]\u2019s \u2018dioptric\u2019 lens system in 1823. [[Nore|The Nore]] [[Lightvessel|lightship]] was established as the world's first floating light in 1732.\n\nAfter the reforms of the [[Lighthouse Act 1836]] by which Trinity House accepted powers to levy out the last private lighthouse owners and began refurbishing and upgrading its lighthouse estate, owners still managed to collect large dues, of which the largest were for the [[Smalls Lighthouse]] which collected \u00a323,000 in 1852 and Trinity  House was forced to spend over \u00a31m in buying back leases, including \u00a3444,000 for the [[Skerries Lighthouse]].{{sfn|Douglas|Christie|1975|p=47}}\n\n==Modern lighthouses==\n===Construction===\nThe modern era of lighthouses began at the turn of the 18th century, as lighthouse construction boomed in lockstep with burgeoning levels of [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] commerce. Advances in structural engineering and new and efficient lighting equipment allowed for the creation of larger and more powerful lighthouses, including ones exposed to the sea. The function of lighthouses shifted toward the provision of a visible warning against shipping hazards, such as rocks or reefs.\n\n====Eddystone lighthouse====\n[[File:Smeaton's Lighthouse00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Smeaton]]'s rebuilt version of the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]], 1759.

The fuel was vaporized at high pressure and burned to heat the mantle, giving an output of over six times the luminosity of traditional oil lights.\n\nThe use of gas as illuminant became widely available with the invention of the [[Dal\u00e9n light]] by Swedish engineer, [[Gustaf Dal\u00e9n]]. In 1906, Dal\u00e9n became the chief engineer at the [[AGA AB|Gas Accumulator Company]]. Initially Dal\u00e9n worked with [[acetylene]], an extremely explosive [[hydrocarbon]] gas. Dal\u00e9n invented [[Agamassan]] (Aga), a [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] used to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation. Acetylene produced an ultra-bright white-light and immediately superseded the duller-flamed [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] as the fuel of choice in lighthouse illuminations. Dal\u00e9n incorporated another invention into his light - the '[[sun valve]]'. This device allowed the light to operate only at night, conserving fuel, and extending their service life to over a year.\n\nThe AGA lighthouse equipment worked without any type of electric supply and was thus extremely reliable. To a rugged coastal area like [[Scandinavia]], his mass-produced, robust, minimal maintenance lights were a significant boon to safety and livelihood. AGA Lighthouses covered the entire [[Panama Canal]]. The technology was the predominant form of light source in [[lighthouses]] from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant.\n\nThe first electrically illuminated lighthouse was the tower at [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]], [[Kent]] in 1862. It was powered by a large [[carbon arc lamp]], although it was later converted back to [[oil]], as the arc lamps were difficult to operate (needing twice the number of keepers) and were not as cost-effective as oil lamps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/lighthouse_list/dungeness.html|title=Dungeness|accessdate=2012-12-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017043302/http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/lighthouse_list/dungeness.html|archivedate=2012-10-17}}</ref> [[South Foreland Lighthouse]] was the first tower to successfully use an electric light in 1875.

[[William Hutchinson (privateer)|William Hutchinson]] developed the first practical optical system in 1763, known as a [[catoptrics|catoptric]] system. He constructed paraboloidal reflectors by attaching small pieces of reflective material to a cast that had been moulded into an approximate paraboloid. This rudimentary system effectively collimated the emitted light into a concentrated beam, thereby greatly increasing the light's visibility. His system was installed in the newly built [[Leasowe#Leasowe Lighthouse|Leasowe Lighthouse]], and was later copied elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/340721/lighthouse/72152/Oil-lamps|title=Lighthouse|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref> The ability to focus the light led to the first revolving lighthouse beams, where the light would appear to the mariners as a series of intermittent flashes.

His design allowed for the construction of lenses of large [[aperture]] and short [[focal length]], without the mass and volume of material that would be required by a lens of conventional design. A Fresnel lens can be made much thinner than a comparable conventional lens, in some cases taking the form of a flat sheet. A Fresnel lens can also capture more oblique light from a light source, thus allowing the light from a lighthouse equipped with one to be visible over greater distances.\n\nThe first Fresnel lens was used in 1823 in the [[Cordouan lighthouse]] at the mouth of the [[Gironde estuary]]; its light could be seen from more than {{convert|20|mi|km}} out.<ref>Watson, Bruce.  \"Science Makes a Better Lighthouse Lens.\" ''Smithsonian''.

Since raising the fire would improve the visibility, placing the fire on a platform became a practice that led to the development of the lighthouse. In antiquity, the lighthouse functioned more as an entrance marker to ports than as a warning signal for reefs and promontories, unlike many modern lighthouses.\n\n===Greek-Roman period===\n[[Image:PHAROS2006.jpg|thumb|Graphic reconstruction of the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] according to a 2006 study.]]\nAccording to [[Homer]]ic legend, [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]] of [[Nafplio]] invented the first lighthouse, although they are certainly attested with the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (designed and constructed by [[Sostratus of Cnidus]]) and the [[Colossus of Rhodes]]. However, [[Themistocles]] had earlier established a lighthouse at the harbor of [[Piraeus]] connected to Athens in the 5th century BC, essentially a small stone column with a fire beacon.<ref>Elinor Dewire and Dolores Reyes-Pergioudakis (2010). ''The Lighthouses of Greece''. Sarasota: Pineapple Press. {{ISBN|978-1-56164-452-0}}, pp 1-5.</ref>\n\nWritten descriptions and drawings of the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] of [[Alexandria]] provide information about lighthouses, but the tower itself collapsed during an earthquake many centuries after its construction in the 3rd century BC by the Greeks. The intact [[Tower of Hercules]] at [[A Coru\u00f1a]] and the ruins of the [[Dubris|Dover]] lighthouse in England give insight into construction; other evidence about lighthouses exists in depictions on coins and mosaics, of which many represent the lighthouse at [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]]. Coins from Alexandria, Ostia, and [[Latakia|Laodicea in Syria]] also exist.\n\nWhile the evidence provides insight into the exterior structure of these structures, there are many gaps in evidence concerning less visible aspects of the structures. The remains at [[A Coru\u00f1a]] and [[Dover]] help determine how each lighthouse structure functioned, though one must make some assumptions to determine how the structures [[beacon]]s were illuminated. Presumably locally available fuels will have included wood and probably coal to keep a fire going continuously during the night, and there is a large chimney leading to the top room at the [[Tower of Hercules]]. The example from Dover has been converted at some stage into a simple [[watchtower]].\n\n[[Image:DoverCastle-lighthouse-2004-10-03.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Roman lighthouse at [[Dover Castle]]]]\nLighthouse keepers may have added combustible liquids to reduce the expenditure on fuel and keep the light steady during [[gale]]s, but little information exists in the literature from the time. It may also be possible that the light was protected from the wind by glass windows, and large mirrors may have assisted in projecting the light beam as far as possible. It is likely that lighthouses would have required considerable labour for transporting the fuel and maintaining the flame. At [[Cape Hatteras]] in the 1870s, one keeper and two assistants kept themselves busy by tending more sophisticated flames from powerful oil lamps.\n\nWhile artistic representations assist us in re-creating a visual image of lighthouses, they present many problems. Depictions of lighthouses on [[Roman coins]], [[inscriptions]], carvings, and [[mosaic]]s present an inconsistent view of the actual appearances of the structures. Most show a building with two or three stories that decreases in width as it ascends. The limited size of coins could cause the producer of the coin to alter the image to fit on the surface. The similarity in depictions of lighthouses is symbolic rather than accurate representations of specific beacons.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Cordouanchastillon.jpg|thumb|200px|Engraving of the Cordouan tower completed in 1611]]\nDuring the middle age times, Roman lighthouses fell into disuse, but some remained functional, such as the Farum Brigantium, now known as the [[Tower of Hercules]], in A Coru\u00f1a, Spain, and others in the Mediterranean Sea such as the [[Lighthouse of Genoa|Lanterna]] at [[Genoa]].

Advances in structural engineering and new and efficient lighting equipment allowed for the creation of larger and more powerful lighthouses, including ones exposed to the sea. The function of lighthouses shifted toward the provision of a visible warning against shipping hazards, such as rocks or reefs.\n\n====Eddystone lighthouse====\n[[File:Smeaton's Lighthouse00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Smeaton]]'s rebuilt version of the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]], 1759.

His greatest achievement was the construction of the [[Bell Rock Lighthouse]] in 1810, one of the most impressive feats of engineering of the age. This structure was based upon the design of the earlier Eddystone Lighthouse by [[John Smeaton]], but with several improved features, such as the incorporation of rotating lights, alternating between red and white.<ref>{{citation|title=John Rennie, 1761\u20131821: The Life and Work of a Great Engineer|first=Cyril Thomas Goodman|last=Boucher|page=61|year=1963|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wu8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59}}</ref>\n\nStevenson worked for the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] for nearly fifty years<ref name=\"NLB\" /> during which time he designed and oversaw the construction and later improvement of numerous lighthouses. He innovated in the choice of light sources, mountings, reflector design, the use of [[Fresnel lens]]es, and in rotation and shuttering systems providing lighthouses with individual signatures allowing them to be identified by seafarers. He also invented the movable jib and the balance crane as a necessary part for lighthouse construction.\n\nStevenson established a great dynasty of engineers specializing in lighthouse construction - his descendants were responsible for most of the lighthouse construction in [[Scotland]] for a century. Three of Robert's sons followed in his path: [[David Stevenson (engineer)|David]], [[Alan Stevenson|Alan]], and [[Thomas Stevenson|Thomas]]. Two of David's children, [[David Alan Stevenson|David Alan]] and [[Charles Alexander Stevenson|Charles Alexander]] also became distinguished lighthouse engineers in their own right.\n\n[[Alexander Mitchell (engineer)|Alexander Mitchell]] designed the first [[screw-pile lighthouse]] - his lighthouse was built on piles that were [[screw]]ed into the sandy or muddy seabed. Construction of his design began in 1838 at the mouth of the [[Thames]] and was known as the [[Maplin Sands]] lighthouse, and first lit in 1841.<ref name=Tomlinson>{{cite book|title=Tomlinson's Cyclopaedia of Useful Arts|year=1852\u201354|publisher=Virtue & Co.|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/cyclopdiaofuse02tomlrich/page/177 177]|editor=Tomlinson|url=https://archive.org/details/cyclopdiaofuse02tomlrich|quote=\"[Maplin Sands] was not, however, the first screw-pile lighthouse actually erected, for during the long preparation process which was carried on at Maplin Sands, a structure of the same principle had been begun and completed at Port Fleetwood...\"}}</ref> However, though its construction began later, the [[Wyre Light (Fleetwood)|Wyre Light]] in Fleetwood, Lancashire, was the first to be lit (in 1840).<ref name=Tomlinson />\n\n====Lighthouses in America====\nThe first lighthouse in America was the [[Boston Light]], built in 1716 at [[Boston Harbor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/legendarylighthouses |title=Legendary Lighthouses |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}</ref> Lighthouses were soon built along the marshy coast lines from [[Delaware]] to [[North Carolina]], where navigation was difficult and treacherous.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/legendarylighthouses/html/natlgeo.html |title=Legendary Lighthouses: Geography-North Atlantic |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}</ref> These were generally made of wood, as it was readily available. Due to the fire hazard, masonry towers were increasingly built - the oldest standing masonry tower was [[Sandy Hook Lighthouse]], built in 1764 in [[New Jersey]].\n\nScrew-pile lighthouses were used in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and along the [[The Carolinas|Carolina]] coast in the [[United States]]. The first screw pile light in the United States was Brandywine Shoal in the Delaware Bay. They became especially popular after the Civil War when the Lighthouse Board approved a policy to replace lighthouses in the interior. Around 100 of these complex structures were built on the Atlantic coast line from the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays down to the Florida Keys and Gulf of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/maritime/constype/screw.htm |title=Lighthouse Construction Types |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2004-01-23 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}</ref> One of the most famous towers was the [[Thomas Point Shoal Light]] - it has been called \u201cthe finest example of a screw pile cottage anywhere in the world.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/legendarylighthouses/html/natlgl.html |title=Legendary Lighthouses: Great Lighthouses-North Atlantic |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}</ref>\n\nOn March 3, 1851, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed ''\"An Act Making Appropriations for Light House, Light Boats, Buoys, &c.\"'', leading to the creation of the [[United States Lighthouse Board]] to replace the [[United States Department of Treasury|Department of Treasury]]'s Lighthouse Establishment as the governmental agency responsible for the construction and maintenance of all [[lighthouse]]s and navigation aids in the [[United States]]\n\n===Lighting improvements===\n[[File:Verre du bec d'Argand.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Argand lamp]] with circular wick and glass chimney. <small>(Illustration from ''Les Merveilles de la science'' [1867-1869] by [[Louis Figuier]]).</small>]]\nThe source of illumination had generally been wood pyres or burning coal but this was expensive, some lighthouses consuming 400 tons of coal a year. Candles or oil lamps backed by concave mirrors were used, often in large banks. The French conducted a series of tests between 1783 and 1788 with varying results. Smeaton's Eddystone lighthouse used 24 candles until 1810.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stevenson|first=D Alan|title=The World's Lighthouses before 1820|year=1959|publisher=Oxford University Press|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Argand lamp]], invented in 1782 by the Swiss scientist, [[Aim\u00e9 Argand]], revolutionized lighthouse illumination with its steady smokeless flame.

This steadied the flame and improved the flow of air. Early models used ground glass which was sometimes tinted around the wick.

The lamp was first produced by [[Matthew Boulton]], in partnership with Argand, in 1784 and became the standard for lighthouses for over a century.\n\n[[John Richardson Wigham]] was the first to develop a system for [[coal gas|gas]] illumination of lighthouses. He was given a grant by the Dublin Ballast Board in 1865 and he fitted his new gas 'crocus' burner at the [[Baily Lighthouse]] in [[Howth Head]],<ref group=note>The 'crocus' burner was important in that it established the superiority of gas over oil, however Wigham replaced the 'crocus' design with his 'composite' burner</ref> giving an output 4 times more powerful than the equivalent oil lights. An improved 'composite' design, installed in the Baily light in 1868, was 13 times more powerful than the most brilliant light then known, according to the scientist [[John Tyndall]], an advisor to the [[United Kingdom]]'s lighthouse authority, [[Trinity House]].<ref name=cil>{{cite journal| title=John Richardson Wigham 1829\u20131906 | url=http://www.commissionersofirishlights.com/media/35546/Beam_2006.PDF#page=23 | publisher=Commissioners of Irish Lights | journal=BEAM | volume=35 |date=July 2006| pages=21\u201322}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870, the light at [[Wicklow Head]] was fitted with Wigham's [[patent]] intermittent flashing mechanism, which timed the gas supply by means of [[clockwork]].<ref name=\"cil\"/> When this mechanism was combined with a revolving [[Fresnel lens|lens]] in [[Rockabill]] Lighthouse, the world's first lighthouse with a [[Flashing light|group-flashing]] [[Light characteristic|characteristic]] was produced.\n\n[[File:Dalen fyr 2007 l.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The AGA lighthouse \"Blockhusudden\", set up in 1912, used the [[Dal\u00e9n light]] invented in 1906.]]\nThe vaporized [[oil burner]] was invented in 1901 by [[Arthur Kitson]], and improved by David Hood at [[Trinity House]]. The fuel was vaporized at high pressure and burned to heat the mantle, giving an output of over six times the luminosity of traditional oil lights.\n\nThe use of gas as illuminant became widely available with the invention of the [[Dal\u00e9n light]] by Swedish engineer, [[Gustaf Dal\u00e9n]]. In 1906, Dal\u00e9n became the chief engineer at the [[AGA AB|Gas Accumulator Company]]. Initially Dal\u00e9n worked with [[acetylene]], an extremely explosive [[hydrocarbon]] gas. Dal\u00e9n invented [[Agamassan]] (Aga), a [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] used to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation. Acetylene produced an ultra-bright white-light and immediately superseded the duller-flamed [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] as the fuel of choice in lighthouse illuminations. Dal\u00e9n incorporated another invention into his light - the '[[sun valve]]'. This device allowed the light to operate only at night, conserving fuel, and extending their service life to over a year.\n\nThe AGA lighthouse equipment worked without any type of electric supply and was thus extremely reliable. To a rugged coastal area like [[Scandinavia]], his mass-produced, robust, minimal maintenance lights were a significant boon to safety and livelihood. AGA Lighthouses covered the entire [[Panama Canal]]. The technology was the predominant form of light source in [[lighthouses]] from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant.\n\nThe first electrically illuminated lighthouse was the tower at [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]], [[Kent]] in 1862. It was powered by a large [[carbon arc lamp]], although it was later converted back to [[oil]], as the arc lamps were difficult to operate (needing twice the number of keepers) and were not as cost-effective as oil lamps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/lighthouse_list/dungeness.html|title=Dungeness|accessdate=2012-12-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017043302/http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/lighthouse_list/dungeness.html|archivedate=2012-10-17}}</ref> [[South Foreland Lighthouse]] was the first tower to successfully use an electric light in 1875.

[[William Hutchinson (privateer)|William Hutchinson]] developed the first practical optical system in 1763, known as a [[catoptrics|catoptric]] system. He constructed paraboloidal reflectors by attaching small pieces of reflective material to a cast that had been moulded into an approximate paraboloid. This rudimentary system effectively collimated the emitted light into a concentrated beam, thereby greatly increasing the light's visibility. His system was installed in the newly built [[Leasowe#Leasowe Lighthouse|Leasowe Lighthouse]], and was later copied elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/340721/lighthouse/72152/Oil-lamps|title=Lighthouse|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref> The ability to focus the light led to the first revolving lighthouse beams, where the light would appear to the mariners as a series of intermittent flashes. It also became possible to transmit complex signals using the light flashes.\n\nThe idea of creating a thinner, lighter lens by making it with separate sections mounted in a frame is often attributed to [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9035385 |title=Fresnel lens |work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |year=2012  |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.

His design allowed for the construction of lenses of large [[aperture]] and short [[focal length]], without the mass and volume of material that would be required by a lens of conventional design. A Fresnel lens can be made much thinner than a comparable conventional lens, in some cases taking the form of a flat sheet. A Fresnel lens can also capture more oblique light from a light source, thus allowing the light from a lighthouse equipped with one to be visible over greater distances.\n\nThe first Fresnel lens was used in 1823 in the [[Cordouan lighthouse]] at the mouth of the [[Gironde estuary]]; its light could be seen from more than {{convert|20|mi|km}} out.<ref>Watson, Bruce.  \"Science Makes a Better Lighthouse Lens.\" ''Smithsonian''.

In 1985 he received the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu|National Film Award]] for ''[[Sitaara]]''.\nVamsy has his own style of making the movie with art like the director [[Bapu (film director)]].\n\n== Early life ==\nVamsy was born and brought up at the village of [[Pasalapudi]], near Ramachandrapuram of [[East Godavari]] District, [[Andhra Pradesh]] on 20 November 1956.\n\n== Career ==\nVamsy worked as an assistant director to [[Kasinadhuni Viswanath|K Viswanath]] on [[Sankarabharanam (1980 film)|Sankarabharanam]], Bharati Rajaa on Seethakoka Chiluka before making his first film ''[[Manchupallaki]]'' with [[Chiranjeevi]], [[Suhasini Mani Ratnam|Suhasini]],Tripuraneni Sai Chand and [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] in 1982. This movie was a remake of the Tamil film ''[[Palaivana Solai (1981 film)|Palaivana Solai]]'' directed by Robert-Rajasekaran.<ref>[http://vamsy.net/manchupallaki.html \"Manchupallaki on vamsy.net\"]</ref> In 1984, Vamsy made the critically acclaimed ''[[Sitaara]]'', with which he introduced [[Bhanupriya]] to the Telugu film industry. The movie was adapted from his own novel ''Mahal lo Kokila'' (''The Nightingale in the Palace''). The movie won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu]]. In 1985, he made 'Preminchu Pelladu', the first movie with [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] as the sole lead.<ref>[http://www.vamsy.net/pp.html \"Preminchu Pelladu on vamsy.net\"]</ref>\n\nFor a significant period of his career, Vamsy collaborated with the music director [[Ilayaraja]]. Some of their best work has been in co-operation with each other. The two were so attuned to each other's way of thinking that for a song in his movie ''[[Ladies Tailor (1985 film)|Ladies Tailor]]'', Vamsy shot the song picturization (\"Ekkada Ekkada\") before the song was recorded by music director.<ref>[http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/realstars/vamsi2.html \"Article on Vamsy-Ilayaraja combo\"]</ref> This is against the norm as usually the songs are recorded first and the filming made later in most movies.\n\nHe has published a short stories compilation called ''Maa Pasalapudi Kathalu''. Besides that compilation, Vamsy has written a wide variety of short stories since 1974 when he was 16 years old. His major works include ''Mahallo kokila'', ''Manchupallaki'', ''Aa Naati Vaana Chinukulu'', ''Venditera Kathalu'' (original scripts of ''[[Sankarabharanam (1980 film)|Sankarabharanam]]'' and ''[[Anveshana]]''), ''Vennela Bomma'', ''Gokulam lo Radha'', ''Ravvala konda'', ''Sree seetarama lanchi service Rajahmundry'', ''Manyam rani'', ''Rangularatnam''. He has penned around 150 short stories published in swathi weekly under title \"Maa Diguwa Godavari Kathalu\" For his contributions to the art of story telling with a native approach through his books he was bestowed with \"Sripada Puraskhaaram\" at Rajamundry on 17 April 2011.\n\nHe also directed a TV serial named ''Lady detective'' for ETV-Telugu which was aired on every Thursday in 1995\u201396.\n\n== Style ==\nVamsy is one of the very few filmmakers in Telugu who tries to depict the nativity of the concerned story. Although he is well known for portraying the scenic beauty of Godavari and surrounding regions, the element of characterization is the highlight in his films. Ilaiyaraja has special affection for Vamsi to the extent he once gave 100 tunes to pick from for a particular movie. He used to take Vamsi to several special spots in Tamil Nadu including Spiritual places, Temples, Forests, mountains like kollimalai and Arunachalam.\n\nHe directed [[Anveshana]] in 1985, a murder mystery thriller set in Talakona forest background (Near [[Tirupati|Tirupathi]]). Vamsi mentioned he got inspiration from 1971 European movie Cat o' Nine Tails. Ilaiyaraaja scored brilliant background music to evoke the spooky forest atmosphere and horror surrounding the murders. The film still stands as an unmatched classic thriller in Telugu industry with Hitchcockish suspense ending. Vamsi mentioned that director Ram Gopal varma became so obsessed with this movie that RGV watched the movie 22 times during his college days.\n\n==Filmography==\n===Director<ref name=\"Vamsy's filmography on Vamsy.net\">[http://vamsy.net/filmo.html \"Vamsy's filmography on Vamsy.net\" <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1985 he received the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu|National Film Award]] for ''[[Sitaara]]''.\nVamsy has his own style of making the movie with art like the director [[Bapu (film director)]].\n\n== Early life ==\nVamsy was born and brought up at the village of [[Pasalapudi]], near Ramachandrapuram of [[East Godavari]] District, [[Andhra Pradesh]] on 20 November 1956.\n\n== Career ==\nVamsy worked as an assistant director to [[Kasinadhuni Viswanath|K Viswanath]] on [[Sankarabharanam (1980 film)|Sankarabharanam]], Bharati Rajaa on Seethakoka Chiluka before making his first film ''[[Manchupallaki]]'' with [[Chiranjeevi]], [[Suhasini Mani Ratnam|Suhasini]],Tripuraneni Sai Chand and [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] in 1982. This movie was a remake of the Tamil film ''[[Palaivana Solai (1981 film)|Palaivana Solai]]'' directed by Robert-Rajasekaran.<ref>[http://vamsy.net/manchupallaki.html \"Manchupallaki on vamsy.net\"]</ref> In 1984, Vamsy made the critically acclaimed ''[[Sitaara]]'', with which he introduced [[Bhanupriya]] to the Telugu film industry. The movie was adapted from his own novel ''Mahal lo Kokila'' (''The Nightingale in the Palace''). The movie won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu]]. In 1985, he made 'Preminchu Pelladu', the first movie with [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] as the sole lead.<ref>[http://www.vamsy.net/pp.html \"Preminchu Pelladu on vamsy.net\"]</ref>\n\nFor a significant period of his career, Vamsy collaborated with the music director [[Ilayaraja]]. Some of their best work has been in co-operation with each other. The two were so attuned to each other's way of thinking that for a song in his movie ''[[Ladies Tailor (1985 film)|Ladies Tailor]]'', Vamsy shot the song picturization (\"Ekkada Ekkada\") before the song was recorded by music director.<ref>[http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/realstars/vamsi2.html \"Article on Vamsy-Ilayaraja combo\"]</ref> This is against the norm as usually the songs are recorded first and the filming made later in most movies.\n\nHe has published a short stories compilation called ''Maa Pasalapudi Kathalu''. Besides that compilation, Vamsy has written a wide variety of short stories since 1974 when he was 16 years old. His major works include ''Mahallo kokila'', ''Manchupallaki'', ''Aa Naati Vaana Chinukulu'', ''Venditera Kathalu'' (original scripts of ''[[Sankarabharanam (1980 film)|Sankarabharanam]]'' and ''[[Anveshana]]''), ''Vennela Bomma'', ''Gokulam lo Radha'', ''Ravvala konda'', ''Sree seetarama lanchi service Rajahmundry'', ''Manyam rani'', ''Rangularatnam''. He has penned around 150 short stories published in swathi weekly under title \"Maa Diguwa Godavari Kathalu\" For his contributions to the art of story telling with a native approach through his books he was bestowed with \"Sripada Puraskhaaram\" at Rajamundry on 17 April 2011.\n\nHe also directed a TV serial named ''Lady detective'' for ETV-Telugu which was aired on every Thursday in 1995\u201396.\n\n== Style ==\nVamsy is one of the very few filmmakers in Telugu who tries to depict the nativity of the concerned story. Although he is well known for portraying the scenic beauty of Godavari and surrounding regions, the element of characterization is the highlight in his films. Ilaiyaraja has special affection for Vamsi to the extent he once gave 100 tunes to pick from for a particular movie. He used to take Vamsi to several special spots in Tamil Nadu including Spiritual places, Temples, Forests, mountains like kollimalai and Arunachalam.\n\nHe directed [[Anveshana]] in 1985, a murder mystery thriller set in Talakona forest background (Near [[Tirupati|Tirupathi]]). Vamsi mentioned he got inspiration from 1971 European movie Cat o' Nine Tails. Ilaiyaraaja scored brilliant background music to evoke the spooky forest atmosphere and horror surrounding the murders. The film still stands as an unmatched classic thriller in Telugu industry with Hitchcockish suspense ending. Vamsi mentioned that director Ram Gopal varma became so obsessed with this movie that RGV watched the movie 22 times during his college days.\n\n==Filmography==\n===Director<ref name=\"Vamsy's filmography on Vamsy.net\">[http://vamsy.net/filmo.html \"Vamsy's filmography on Vamsy.net\" <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
