Damascus was captured when [[Desert Mounted Corps]] and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Feisal]]'s Sherifial Hejaz Army encircled the city, after a cavalry pursuit northwards along the two main roads to [[Damascus]]. During the pursuit to Damascus, many rearguards established by remnants of the Ottoman [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fourth]], [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Seventh]] and [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Armies]] were attacked and captured by Prince Feisal's Sherifial Army, [[Desert Mounted Corps]]' [[Australian Mounted Division]] the [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th]] and the [[5th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|5th Cavalry Divisions]]. The important tactical success of capturing Damascus resulted in political manoeuvring by representatives from France, Britain and Prince Feisal's [[Arab Revolt|force]].\n\nFollowing the victories at the [[Battle of Sharon]] and [[Battle of Nablus (1918)|Battle of Nablus]] during the Battle of Megiddo, on 25 September, the combined attacks by the [[XXI Corps (United Kingdom)|XXI Corps]], Desert Mounted Corps, the [[XX Corps (United Kingdom)|XX Corps]] supported by [[Battle of Sharon#EEF air support and aerial bombing|extensive aerial bombing attacks]], gained all objectives. The Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills were forced by the attacks at [[Battle of Tulkarm (1918)|Tulkarm]], and [[Battle of Tabsor|Tabsor]] to disengage and retreat, in turn forcing the Fourth Army, east of the Jordan River to avoid outflanking by retreating from [[Third Transjordan attack|Amman]] when they were attacked by Chaytor's Force. As a consequence of these withdrawals large numbers of prisoners were captured at [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Jenin]] while the surviving columns retreated behind a strong rearguard at [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|Samakh]].\n\nThe commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, General [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]] ordered Lieutenant General [[Harry Chauvel]]'s Desert Mounted Corps to pursue the remnants of the three Ottoman armies and capture Damascus. The 4th Cavalry Division began the pursuit, attacking rearguards along the inland road at [[Charge at Irbid|Irbid]] on 26 September, at Er Remta and Prince Feisal's Sherifial Army captured [[Daraa|Deraa]] on 27 September. The Australian Mounted Division attacked rearguards along the main road, at [[Battle of Jisr Benat Yakub|Jisr Benat Yakub]] on 27 September, occupying [[Quneitra]] the next day, at [[Sa'sa']] on 29/30 September, and at [[Charge at Kaukab|Kaukab]] and the [[Barada]] Gorge on 30 September, while the 5th Cavalry Division also attacked a rearguard at [[Charge at Kiswe|Kiswe]] the same day. Following these successful attacks and advances the [[3rd Light Horse Brigade]] was ordered to move north of Damascus, marching through the city on the morning of 1 October to continue their attack on the retreating columns, cutting the road to [[Homs]].\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Battle of Samakh (1918)|Capture of Tiberias (1918)|Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Sharon (1918)|Battle of Nablus (1918)|Third Transjordan attack (1918)|Sinai and Palestine Campaign|First Transjordan attack on Amman|Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt|Third Transjordan attack}}\n[[File:Falls Map 21det.jpeg|thumb|Falls Map 21 Cavalry advances 19 to 25 September 1918.

The [[Yildirim Army Group]] had also lost most of their transport and guns, while the EEF advances further strained their administrative and transport services.<ref>Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 560</ref>\n\nAt Lajjun on 22 September, Allenby outlined his plans to Chauvel for an advance to Damascus. Before this could be achieved, though, Haifa and important logistics nodes had to be captured. Additionally, the Fourth Army still held Amman and the rearguard was still in place at Samakh,<ref name=\"Falls560\u20131\">Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 560\u20131</ref> Nevertheless, on 26 September, the Inspector General [[Line of communication|Lines of Communication]] took control of all the captured territory up to a line stretching from [[Jisr ed Damieh]] on the Jordan River to [[Nahr el Faliq]] on the Mediterranean Sea.<ref name=\"Falls561\">Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 561</ref> The same day detachments from the XX and XXI Corps had moved north to take over garrison duties in the Esdraelon Plain, at Nazareth and at Samakh, from Desert Mounted Corps and transport from the XXI Corps was placed at their disposal.<ref name=\"Falls560\u20131\"/>\n\n==Prelude==\n\n=== Liman von Sanders withdraws ===\n[[File:Gullett Map43Chaytor'sForce.png|thumb|Gullett's Map 43 shows the Jordan River from the Dead Sea and Jericho to Semakh and the Pilgrims Road from Ziza to Deraa with the 4th Light Horse Brigade at Samakh, retiring Ottoman columns, the Ottoman Fourth Army headquarters at Deraa and Chaytor's Force at Amman on 25 September]]\nWhile [[Otto Liman von Sanders]] was out of contact until late in the afternoon of 20 September, following his hasty retreat from [[Battle of Nazareth (1918)|Nazareth]] in the early hours of the morning, the Fourth Army, still without orders stood firm.

The first stage to the line, \"Damascus\u2013Beirut\" was to begin shortly. While an infantry division marched up the coast [[Pursuit to Haritan#EEF advance from Haifa|from Haifa]] to Beirut, three divisions of the Desert Mounted Corps would advance on Damascus.

[being] more likely to join in an attack on the city than to help its defence.\" In and around the main suburb of Salahiyeh, on the northwestern edge are many Kurds, Algerians and Cretan Moslems. One fifth of those living in the city are Christians of all denominations, including Armenians, while there are also some Jews of very ancient settlement. Almost all of the remainder are Arab Moslems. \"The population is singularly particularist, proud, exclusive, conservative, and jealous of western interference. Arab independence centred on Damascus is a dream for which it will fight ...\"<ref>Army Handbook 9/4/18 p. 69</ref>\n\nThe town was racially diverse and both Christian and Muslim services were held in the Great Mosque.

In the circumstances that existed, it may well be believed that close clinical observation was not easy. Most of the pyrexia was called influenza, dysentery, or even cholera. An outbreak of cerebro-spinal fever was suspected. The arrival of the Malaria Diagnosis Station on October 12 in some measure cleared up the situation. All the supposed cholera and cerebral cases, and a large proportion of those of dysentery, were found malarial. Of the cases diagnosed as influenza and whose blood was examined, a large proportion were found to harbour the malarial parasite and were presumed to be cases of this same disease. It is therefore clear that, simultaneously with an outbreak of pneumonic influenza, a huge rise took place at this moment in the incidence of malignant malaria both in the Desert Mounted Corps and also in Chaytor's Force.|R.

The staff was exhausted and severely reduced; medical supplies and blankets ran low. One hundred Australian light horsemen were reassigned to medical orderly duties, a large convoy of sick was evacuated by motor lorries the next day and the arrival of supplies of milk relieved the situation.

Damascus was captured when [[Desert Mounted Corps]] and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Feisal]]'s Sherifial Hejaz Army encircled the city, after a cavalry pursuit northwards along the two main roads to [[Damascus]]. During the pursuit to Damascus, many rearguards established by remnants of the Ottoman [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fourth]], [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Seventh]] and [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Armies]] were attacked and captured by Prince Feisal's Sherifial Army, [[Desert Mounted Corps]]' [[Australian Mounted Division]] the [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th]] and the [[5th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|5th Cavalry Divisions]]. The important tactical success of capturing Damascus resulted in political manoeuvring by representatives from France, Britain and Prince Feisal's [[Arab Revolt|force]].\n\nFollowing the victories at the [[Battle of Sharon]] and [[Battle of Nablus (1918)|Battle of Nablus]] during the Battle of Megiddo, on 25 September, the combined attacks by the [[XXI Corps (United Kingdom)|XXI Corps]], Desert Mounted Corps, the [[XX Corps (United Kingdom)|XX Corps]] supported by [[Battle of Sharon#EEF air support and aerial bombing|extensive aerial bombing attacks]], gained all objectives. The Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills were forced by the attacks at [[Battle of Tulkarm (1918)|Tulkarm]], and [[Battle of Tabsor|Tabsor]] to disengage and retreat, in turn forcing the Fourth Army, east of the Jordan River to avoid outflanking by retreating from [[Third Transjordan attack|Amman]] when they were attacked by Chaytor's Force. As a consequence of these withdrawals large numbers of prisoners were captured at [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Jenin]] while the surviving columns retreated behind a strong rearguard at [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|Samakh]].\n\nThe commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, General [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]] ordered Lieutenant General [[Harry Chauvel]]'s Desert Mounted Corps to pursue the remnants of the three Ottoman armies and capture Damascus. The 4th Cavalry Division began the pursuit, attacking rearguards along the inland road at [[Charge at Irbid|Irbid]] on 26 September, at Er Remta and Prince Feisal's Sherifial Army captured [[Daraa|Deraa]] on 27 September. The Australian Mounted Division attacked rearguards along the main road, at [[Battle of Jisr Benat Yakub|Jisr Benat Yakub]] on 27 September, occupying [[Quneitra]] the next day, at [[Sa'sa']] on 29/30 September, and at [[Charge at Kaukab|Kaukab]] and the [[Barada]] Gorge on 30 September, while the 5th Cavalry Division also attacked a rearguard at [[Charge at Kiswe|Kiswe]] the same day. Following these successful attacks and advances the [[3rd Light Horse Brigade]] was ordered to move north of Damascus, marching through the city on the morning of 1 October to continue their attack on the retreating columns, cutting the road to [[Homs]].\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Battle of Samakh (1918)|Capture of Tiberias (1918)|Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Sharon (1918)|Battle of Nablus (1918)|Third Transjordan attack (1918)|Sinai and Palestine Campaign|First Transjordan attack on Amman|Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt|Third Transjordan attack}}\n[[File:Falls Map 21det.jpeg|thumb|Falls Map 21 Cavalry advances 19 to 25 September 1918.

The [[Yildirim Army Group]] had also lost most of their transport and guns, while the EEF advances further strained their administrative and transport services.<ref>Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 560</ref>\n\nAt Lajjun on 22 September, Allenby outlined his plans to Chauvel for an advance to Damascus. Before this could be achieved, though, Haifa and important logistics nodes had to be captured.

One fifth of those living in the city are Christians of all denominations, including Armenians, while there are also some Jews of very ancient settlement. Almost all of the remainder are Arab Moslems. \"The population is singularly particularist, proud, exclusive, conservative, and jealous of western interference. Arab independence centred on Damascus is a dream for which it will fight ...\"<ref>Army Handbook 9/4/18 p. 69</ref>\n\nThe town was racially diverse and both Christian and Muslim services were held in the Great Mosque.

The exact nature of this was not at the time clear, and has indeed in some measure remained a matter of debate. Damascus was then in the grip of pneumonic influenza, and was suspected\u2014in some cases not without cause\u2014of [[dysentery]], [[typhus]], [[cholera]], [[phlebotomus]] and other fevers. In the circumstances that existed, it may well be believed that close clinical observation was not easy. Most of the pyrexia was called influenza, dysentery, or even cholera. An outbreak of cerebro-spinal fever was suspected. The arrival of the Malaria Diagnosis Station on October 12 in some measure cleared up the situation. All the supposed cholera and cerebral cases, and a large proportion of those of dysentery, were found malarial. Of the cases diagnosed as influenza and whose blood was examined, a large proportion were found to harbour the malarial parasite and were presumed to be cases of this same disease. It is therefore clear that, simultaneously with an outbreak of pneumonic influenza, a huge rise took place at this moment in the incidence of malignant malaria both in the Desert Mounted Corps and also in Chaytor's Force.|R. M. Downes Australian Medical Corps.<ref>Downes 1938 pp. 747, 775</ref>}}\n\nDue to a breakdown in evacuations on 10 October, the only divisional receiving station in Damascus, the 5th Cavalry Division receiving station, had on 11 October between 800 and 900 seriously ill patients mostly suffering from broncho-pneumonia and malignant malaria. There were many deaths and some cases of malarial diarrhoea were diagnosed as cholera. The malarial diagnosis station arrived the next day. The staff was exhausted and severely reduced; medical supplies and blankets ran low. One hundred Australian light horsemen were reassigned to medical orderly duties, a large convoy of sick was evacuated by motor lorries the next day and the arrival of supplies of milk relieved the situation. The Australian Mounted Division receiving station also arrived and relieved the 5th Cavalry Division receiving station which had admitted 1,560 British and Australian sick out of a total of 3,150 admitted to all the medical units that week. At Babtuma hospital the Ottoman sick rose from 900 to 2,000.<ref>Downes 1938 p. 737</ref> Sick prisoners of war were retained in Damascus due to lack of accommodation in Egypt.<ref name=\"Downes739\"/>\n\n[[File:AWMB03318DamascusCemetery.jpg|thumb|Original graveyard at Damascus includes the grave of Trooper Raymond Talbot Cowan 10th Light Horse Regiment who died of malaria on 24 October 1918]]\n\nMedical service personnel became ill at a higher rate than cases from the combat units and no reinforcements were arriving.

The 4th Cavalry Division receiving station was unable to move for eight days owing to illness; only two motor ambulances had drivers.<ref name=\"Downes738\"/> Many doctors became ill during the period including corps staff members. This included the DDMS, Colonel Rupert Downes.

He, along with the ADMS and DADMS Australian Mounted Division, did what they could from their beds; the ADMS 5th Cavalry Division remained well but was with his division [[Pursuit to Haritan|advancing towards Aleppo]].<ref name=\"Downes738\"/><ref name=\"Hill183\"/>\n\nBy 14 October the position in Damascus was quickly becoming normal and by 16 October the evacuation chain was considered to be working satisfactorily. The DMS, EEF at Ramleh following a visit by his ADMS on 11 October to Damascus ordered 100 RAMC privates who had been on their way to France as infantrymen to return to Damascus on 18 October. This would be followed the next day by 18 cars of the Motor Ambulance Convoy and the 25th Casualty Clearing Station took over the Australian Mounted Division receiving station cases.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Sadie Sink]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations (and six wins), four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], set in 1983. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the [[United States Department of Energy]], but secretly does experiments into the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]], including those that involve human test subjects like eleven (millie bobby brown ) . Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rodney |last=Ho |date=July 19, 2016 |url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/08/28/netflix-new-drama-series-stranger-things-to-shoot-in-atlanta/ |title=New Netflix drama series ''Stranger Things'' to shoot in Atlanta |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-netflix-streaming-original-series-idUSKBN0MT1X220150402 |title=Netflix to premiere original series ''Montauk'' in 2016 |date=April 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down. His mother, Joyce, and the town's police chief, Jim Hopper, search for Will. At the same time, a young [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] girl called Eleven escapes from the laboratory and assists Will's friends, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas, in their own efforts to find Will.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/172579-is-hawkins-a-real-town-stranger-things-will-make-you-nostalgic-for-these-other-80s-classics |title=Is Hawkins A Real Town?

Will has been rescued, but few know of the details of the events. When it is discovered that Will is still being influenced by entities from the Upside Down, his friends and family learn there is a larger threat to their universe from the Upside Down.<ref name=\"ew s2tease\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2017/02/09/stranger-things-2-exclusive-plot-revealed/ |title=Stranger Things season 2: Who's in danger?

The new Starcourt Mall has become the center of attention for Hawkins' residents, putting most other stores out of business. Hopper becomes increasingly concerned about Eleven and Mike's relationship while still trying to care for Joyce.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

violent or gory, following in line with how the 1980s [[Amblin Entertainment]] films drove the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Addition of PG-13 rating|PG-13 movie rating]]. It was \"much more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore\", though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly towards the end of the first season.<ref name=\"empire\" /> The brothers had wanted to avoid any [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated effects]] for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with [[practical effect]]s, so they created an animatronic to play the part of the demogorgon.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/g13305063/stranger-things-trivia/?slide=24 |title=50 Things You Didn't Know About 'Stranger Things' |date=November 6, 2017 |work=Harper's BAZAAR |access-date = April 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ew.com/tv/2016/07/20/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-episode-6/ |title='Stranger Things': How the Duffer Brothers created their monster |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date = April 23, 2018}}</ref> However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots. They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of [[R/GA]], led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/stranger-things-titles-came-perfectly-retro/ |title=How the Stranger Things Titles Came Out So Perfectly Retro |first=Sean Patrick |last=Ferrell |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2017 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;

The game uses a [[Pixel art|retro-pixel]] style of art, similar to games for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is loosely based on the ''Stranger Things'' story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16418816/stranger-things-game-iphone-android |title=This Stranger Things mobile game will help prepare you for the Upside Down |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-04-theres-an-official-stranger-things-video-game-and-it-looks-retro-cool |title=There's an official Stranger Things video game and it looks retro cool |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game. The team decided to make the game in a similar style to ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' because it \"was a perfect match because both [''Stranger Things'' and ''Zelda''] are about exploration, and it's kind of a mysterious fit that fit the mood of the show,\" according to BonusXP president Dave Pottinger. The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their [[quality assurance]], instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.<ref name=\"GameDallasObserver\" /> Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beating-the-stranger-things-game-reveals-this-neve/1100-6453794/ |title=Beating The Stranger Things Game Reveals This Never-Before-Seen Clip From Season 2 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The game was downloaded 3{{nbsp}}million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Sadie Sink]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations (and six wins), four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], during the early 1981s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the [[United States Department of Energy]], but secretly does experiments into the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]], including those that involve human test subjects like eleven (millie bobby brown ) . Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rodney |last=Ho |date=July 19, 2016 |url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/08/28/netflix-new-drama-series-stranger-things-to-shoot-in-atlanta/ |title=New Netflix drama series ''Stranger Things'' to shoot in Atlanta |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-netflix-streaming-original-series-idUSKBN0MT1X220150402 |title=Netflix to premiere original series ''Montauk'' in 2016 |date=April 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down.

''Stranger Things'' came about as it sounded similar to another King novel, ''[[Needful Things]]'', though Matt noted they still had a \"lot of heated arguments\" over this final title.<ref name=\"daily beast\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/07/inside-stranger-things-the-duffer-bros-on-how-they-made-the-tv-hit-of-the-summer.html |title=Inside 'Stranger Things': The Duffer Bros. on How They Made the TV Hit of the Summer |first=Melissa |last=Leon |date=August 6, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2017 |website=[[The Daily Beast]]}}</ref>\n\nTo pitch the series, the Duffer Brothers showcased images, footage and music from classic 1970s and 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'', ''[[Hellraiser]]'', ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', ''[[Firestarter (film)|Firestarter]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' and ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', in order to establish the tone of the series.<ref name=\"Miyamoto\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe idea of ''Stranger Things'' started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film ''[[Prisoners (2013 film)|Prisoners]]'', detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped, and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach. As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film ''[[Red Dawn]]'' came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series,<ref name=\"rs\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://frightfind.com/stranger-things-netflix-homage/ |title=Stranger Things is an Homage to the Greats |accessdate=July 26, 2016 |website=FrightFind |date=July 26, 2016}}</ref> crafting it in the realm of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/22/stranger-things-and-the-get-down-reviews |title=On Television: \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down\" |first=Emily |last=Nassbaum |date=August 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |website=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> Other influences cited by the Duffer Brothers include: [[Stephen King]] novels; films produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Wes Craven]],<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/duffer-brothers-talk-stranger-things-916180 |title=The Duffer Brothers Talk 'Stranger Things' Influences, 'It' Dreams and Netflix Phase 2 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=\"screenertv\">{{cite web |url=http://screenertv.com/movies/stranger-things-stephen-king-steven-spielberg-cinematic-influences/ |title=The cinematic influences behind Netflix's 'Stranger Things' |date=July 18, 2016 |work=ScreenerTV}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/07/13/how-netflixs-stranger-things-channels-steven-spielberg-john-carpenter-and-stephen-king/ |title=How Netflix's ''Stranger Things'' Channels Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter and Stephen King |first=Sarene |last=Leeds |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 13, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> and [[Guillermo del Toro]];<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> films such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"screenertv\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/stranger-things-all-the-hidden-and-not-so-hidden-references-in-p/stand-by-me/ |title=Stranger Things: all the hidden (and not-so-hidden) movie, TV and book references |website=The Telegraph |date=August 6, 2016 |accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref> Japanese [[anime]] such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' and ''[[Elfen Lied]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> and several [[video game]]s including ''[[Silent Hill]]'', ''[[Souls (series)|Dark Souls]]'' and ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yes, Stranger Things' Upside Down was totally inspired by Silent Hill |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/yes-stranger-things-upside-down-was-totally-inspired-by-silent-hill/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Tilly |first=Chris |title=How Silent Hill, Dark Souls and The Last of Us Influenced Stranger Things |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/08/26/how-silent-hill-dark-souls-and-the-last-of-us-influenced-stranger-things |work=[[IGN]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> The Duffer Brothers also believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including ''[[Beyond the Black Rainbow]]'' and ''[[D.A.R.Y.L.]]'', discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the series.<ref name=\"hwr montauk\" /> Several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the series, particularly references to 1980s pop culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/stranger-things-21-80s-relics-weve-spotted-so-far-photos/ |title=''Stranger Things'': 21 '80s Relics We've Spotted So Far |first=Meriah |last=Doty |website=[[TheWrap]] |date=July 21, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/stranger-things-film-reference-glossary.html |title=A ''Stranger Things'' Glossary: Every Major Film Reference in the Show, From A\u2013Z |last=Tobias |first=Scott |website=[[Vulture.com]] |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boomhowdy.com/filmtv/stranger-things-influences/ |title=Strange Influences: Our Favorite Movie References From ''Stranger Things'' |first=Tyree |last=Kimber |website=Boomhowdy.com |date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/18481-netflix-stranger-things-80s-pop-culture-references-spielberg |title=Every '80s Pop Culture References in ''Stranger Things'' |first=Sean |last=Hutchinson |website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |date=July 19, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a typical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach.

Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software.

The game uses a [[Pixel art|retro-pixel]] style of art, similar to games for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is loosely based on the ''Stranger Things'' story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16418816/stranger-things-game-iphone-android |title=This Stranger Things mobile game will help prepare you for the Upside Down |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-04-theres-an-official-stranger-things-video-game-and-it-looks-retro-cool |title=There's an official Stranger Things video game and it looks retro cool |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game. The team decided to make the game in a similar style to ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' because it \"was a perfect match because both [''Stranger Things'' and ''Zelda''] are about exploration, and it's kind of a mysterious fit that fit the mood of the show,\" according to BonusXP president Dave Pottinger. The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their [[quality assurance]], instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.<ref name=\"GameDallasObserver\" /> Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beating-the-stranger-things-game-reveals-this-neve/1100-6453794/ |title=Beating The Stranger Things Game Reveals This Never-Before-Seen Clip From Season 2 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The game was downloaded 3{{nbsp}}million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise.
