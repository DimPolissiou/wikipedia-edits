revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda

identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in

[[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in

caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref

92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in

Owned by [[Gray Television]], it is [[sister station|sister]] to two [[low-power broadcasting#Television|low-powered]] stations: [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[KSPR-LD]] (channel 33) and [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]]-licensed [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[KYCW-LD]] (channel 24), both of which are [[simulcast]] on KYTV's respective second and third [[digital subchannels]]. The three stations share studios on West Sunshine Street in Springfield and transmitter facilities on Switchgrass Road/Highway FF north of [[Fordland, Missouri|Fordland]].\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on the air on October 1, 1953, becoming the second television station to sign on in the Springfield market; the first was [[CBS]] affiliate KTTS-TV (channel 10, now [[KOLR]]), which signed on in March of that same year. Founded by the Cox and Duvall families, it operated from a studio on West Sunshine Street, the first facility located west of the [[Mississippi River]] that was built specifically for television production. Channel 3 has been an NBC affiliate since its sign-on, although it also shared a secondary [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-affiliation with KTTS until KMTC (channel 27, now [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[KOZL-TV]]) signed on in 1968. On December 26, 1953, KYTV debuted a television broadcast of the show ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', a live [[country music]] program which originated on radio station [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]] (560 AM); ABC began televising the program nationally on January 22, 1955, although it temporarily originated from [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] until it moved to the Jewell Theatre on April 30 using KYTV's staff and equipment. The station's staff and facilities also played key roles in the production of two other programs that aired on ABC during the 1950s shows ''[[Talent Varieties]]'' and ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show#ABC|The Eddy Arnold Show]]''.\n\nKYTV purchased remote broadcasting equipment in 1954. Its first remote broadcast originated that year from the Ozark Empire Fair. Remote telecasts were also brought to viewers from the Plaza Bowl featuring area bowling teams. Other remotes included Springfield [[Christmas]] parades, \"Man with a Mike\" from the Tower Theater on the Plaza, sporting events, and (beginning in 1986) the station's ''Celebrate the Ozarks'' program. KYTV purchased one of the nation's first mobile videotape units in March 1959. That year, the station videotaped the dedication of [[Table Rock Lake|Table Rock Dam]] and produced Harold Bell Wright's ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills (novel)|The Shepherd of the Hills]]'' on location in Branson. From March 17 to September 22, 1961, KYTV transmitted ''[[Five Star Jubilee]]'' to NBC from the [[Landers Theatre]]. It was the first network [[color television]] program to originate outside of [[New York City]] or [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] although KYTV could not yet broadcast the show locally in color.\n\nIn 1973, the station built a {{Convert|608.4|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} transmission tower in [[Marshfield, Missouri|Marshfield]], which became the [[List of tallest structures in the United States#Missouri|tallest structure in Missouri]], approaching nearly {{Convert|2,000|ft|m|0}}\u2014more than three times the height of the [[Gateway Arch]] in [[St. Louis]].<ref>[http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?searchID=45979436&offset=0 Skyscraper.com - Retrieved February 15, 2010]</ref> In 1978, the Cox and Duvall families sold channel 3 to [[Harte Hanks|Harte-Hanks Communications]]. Harte-Hanks sold the station to [[South Bend, Indiana]]-based Schurz Communications in 1987. In 1997, Schurz migrated KYTV's operations from its original building on West Sunshine Street into new facilities adjacent to the original studio.\n\nIn 2000, KYTV erected a {{Convert|609.4|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} tower in [[Fordland, Missouri|Fordland]] for its digital transmitter; the towers in Marshfield and Fordland were surpassed in 2001 by a {{Convert|609.6|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} tower in [[Syracuse, Missouri|Syracuse]], used by [[PBS]] member station [[KMOS-TV]] in [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]], which was only {{Convert|0.2|m|in|sp=us}} higher than either of KYTV's towers, which remain the second and third tallest structures in the state and are among the [[List of tallest structures in the world|tallest structures in the world]].\n\nOn September 21, 2006, Schurz entered into a deal in which Perkin Media would acquire ABC affiliate KSPR (channel 33, now [[KGHZ]]) from [[Piedmont Television]] and manage that station under a [[local marketing agreement|shared services agreement]]. Under the deal, Schurz controlled all of KSPR's non-license assets, with Perkin serving as the owner of that station's [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] [[broadcast license]]; channel 33's operations remained at its studio facility on East Saint Louis Street until November 2009, when KSPR moved into a new newsroom and studio addition built onto the Sunshine Street facility.\n\nKYTV's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.<ref name=\"Analog to Digital\">{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829004251/http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2013 }}</ref> As part of the [[Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act|SAFER Act]],<ref name=\"FCC Nightlight\">{{Cite web |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-291375A1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201225603/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/wnbc-ch-4-trims-promo-featuring-nypd-commissioner-ray-kelly-super-bowl-airing-article-1.1018204 |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> KYTV kept its analog signal on the air until June 26 to inform viewers of the [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]] through a loop of [[public service announcement]]s from the [[National Association of Broadcasters]].\n\nSchurz announced on September 14, 2015 that it would exit broadcasting and sell its television and radio stations, including KYTV, K15CZ-D (channel 15, now [[KSPR-LD]]), and the SSA with KSPR, to [[Gray Television]] for $442.5 million.<ref name=sbt-saletogray>{{cite news|title=Schurz Communications to sell WSBT and other TV, radio stations|url=http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/schurz-communications-to-sell-wsbt-and-other-tv-radio-stations/article_e95251d6-5b1d-11e5-b80b-ef330f571e57.html|accessdate=September 14, 2015|work=[[South Bend Tribune]]|date=September 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name=b&c-saletogray>{{cite news|last1=Kuperberg|first1=Jonathan|title=Gray Acquiring TV, Radio Stations from Schurz for $442.5 Million|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/gray-acquiring-tv-radio-stations-schurz-4425-million/144190|accessdate=September 14, 2015|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=September 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917040306/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/gray-acquiring-tv-radio-stations-schurz-4425-million/144190|archive-date=September 17, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The FCC approved the sale on February 12, 2016,<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/fcc-approves-gray-schurz-tv-station-deal/153781 FCC Approves Gray-Schurz TV Station Deal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804014705/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/fcc-approves-gray-schurz-tv-station-deal/153781 |date=August 4, 2017 }}.

''[[Jeopardy!]]'', which is usually paired with ''Wheel of Fortune'' in most markets, airs instead on ABC-affiliated sister station KSPR-LD; Springfield is one of the few markets where ''Jeopardy!'' and ''Wheel'' are carried on separate stations. Channel 3 also serves as the local broadcaster of the ''[[Children's Miracle Network Hospitals|Children's Miracle Network]] Telethon'', which airs annually on the first weekend in June.\n\n==News operation==\nKYTV presently broadcasts 24 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4\u00bd hours on weekdays and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station produces the half-hour sports highlight program ''O-Zone Sports'', which airs Sundays at 10:30&nbsp;p.m. The station operates its own [[Doppler weather radar|Doppler radar]] system, called \"Storm Tracker 3\", near its transmitter in Fordland.

A satellite news gathering truck was purchased in 1986. In November 2006, KYTV debuted a new set for its newscasts, which integrated the weather center into the main studio; it also included a background that could be lowered over the set used for sports segments to convert it into an interview area, which changed with the time of day (such as the morning featuring a picture of a sunrise over Springfield). The former weather area was turned into the \"Virtual Newsroom,\" which was later renamed the \"KY3 Web Center,\" where Internet-related news topics are discussed.\n\nAlthough KSPR moved into KYTV's studio facilities on November 1, 2009, the two stations continued to maintain separate news departments for nearly eight years, occasionally sharing footage for certain news stories. On January 28, 2010, beginning with the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, KYTV began broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]; with the upgrade, came the introduction of a new logo and an updated graphics package.

On August 22, 2011 KYTV began producing an hour-long extension of ''Ozarks Today'' on weekday mornings from 7:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m., and a half-hour 9:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast (which expanded to one hour in June 2013) for CW affiliate KYCW-LD; this is despite the fact that the station is simulcast on the second digital subchannel of ABC-affiliated sister station KSPR-LD.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120323075427/http://www.ky3.com/news/ky3-ky3-news-will-add-7-am-and-9-pm-newscast-on-the-ozarks-cw-20110727,0,5500022.story KY3 News will add 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. newscasts on The Ozarks CW]</ref>\n\nIn 2017, KSPR's news operation was folded into KYTV's.

Owned by [[Gray Television]], it is [[sister station|sister]] to two [[low-power broadcasting#Television|low-powered]] stations: [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[KSPR-LD]] (channel 33) and [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]]-licensed [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[KYCW-LD]] (channel 24), both of which are [[simulcast]] on KYTV's respective second and third [[digital subchannels]]. The three stations share studios on West Sunshine Street in Springfield and transmitter facilities on Switchgrass Road/Highway FF north of [[Fordland, Missouri|Fordland]].\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on the air on October 1, 1953, becoming the second television station to sign on in the Springfield market; the first was [[CBS]] affiliate KTTS-TV (channel 10, now [[KOLR]]), which signed on in March of that same year. Founded by the Cox and Duvall families, it operated from a studio on West Sunshine Street, the first facility located west of the [[Mississippi River]] that was built specifically for television production. Channel 3 has been an NBC affiliate since its sign-on, although it also shared a secondary [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-affiliation with KTTS until KMTC (channel 27, now [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[KOZL-TV]]) signed on in 1968. On December 26, 1953, KYTV debuted a television broadcast of the show ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', a live [[country music]] program which originated on radio station [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]] (560 AM); ABC began televising the program nationally on January 22, 1955, although it temporarily originated from [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] until it moved to the Jewell Theatre on April 30 using KYTV's staff and equipment. The station's staff and facilities also played key roles in the production of two other programs that aired on ABC during the 1950s shows ''[[Talent Varieties]]'' and ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show#ABC|The Eddy Arnold Show]]''.\n\nKYTV purchased remote broadcasting equipment in 1954. Its first remote broadcast originated that year from the Ozark Empire Fair. Remote telecasts were also brought to viewers from the Plaza Bowl featuring area bowling teams. Other remotes included Springfield [[Christmas]] parades, \"Man with a Mike\" from the Tower Theater on the Plaza, sporting events, and (beginning in 1986) the station's ''Celebrate the Ozarks'' program. KYTV purchased one of the nation's first mobile videotape units in March 1959. That year, the station videotaped the dedication of [[Table Rock Lake|Table Rock Dam]] and produced Harold Bell Wright's ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills]]'' on location in Branson. From March 17 to September 22, 1961, KYTV transmitted ''[[Five Star Jubilee]]'' to NBC from the [[Landers Theatre]]. It was the first network [[color television]] program to originate outside of [[New York City]] or [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] although KYTV could not yet broadcast the show locally in color.\n\nIn 1973, the station built a {{Convert|608.4|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} transmission tower in [[Marshfield, Missouri|Marshfield]], which became the [[List of tallest structures in the United States#Missouri|tallest structure in Missouri]], approaching nearly {{Convert|2,000|ft|m|0}}\u2014more than three times the height of the [[Gateway Arch]] in [[St. Louis]].<ref>[http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?searchID=45979436&offset=0 Skyscraper.com - Retrieved February 15, 2010]</ref> In 1978, the Cox and Duvall families sold channel 3 to [[Harte Hanks|Harte-Hanks Communications]]. Harte-Hanks sold the station to [[South Bend, Indiana]]-based Schurz Communications in 1987. In 1997, Schurz migrated KYTV's operations from its original building on West Sunshine Street into new facilities adjacent to the original studio.\n\nIn 2000, KYTV erected a {{Convert|609.4|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} tower in [[Fordland, Missouri|Fordland]] for its digital transmitter; the towers in Marshfield and Fordland were surpassed in 2001 by a {{Convert|609.6|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} tower in [[Syracuse, Missouri|Syracuse]], used by [[PBS]] member station [[KMOS-TV]] in [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]], which was only {{Convert|0.2|m|in|sp=us}} higher than either of KYTV's towers, which remain the second and third tallest structures in the state and are among the [[List of tallest structures in the world|tallest structures in the world]].\n\nOn September 21, 2006, Schurz entered into a deal in which Perkin Media would acquire ABC affiliate KSPR (channel 33, now [[KGHZ]]) from [[Piedmont Television]] and manage that station under a [[local marketing agreement|shared services agreement]]. Under the deal, Schurz controlled all of KSPR's non-license assets, with Perkin serving as the owner of that station's [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] [[broadcast license]]; channel 33's operations remained at its studio facility on East Saint Louis Street until November 2009, when KSPR moved into a new newsroom and studio addition built onto the Sunshine Street facility.\n\nKYTV's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.<ref name=\"Analog to Digital\">{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829004251/http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2013 }}</ref> As part of the [[Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act|SAFER Act]],<ref name=\"FCC Nightlight\">{{Cite web |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-291375A1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201225603/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/wnbc-ch-4-trims-promo-featuring-nypd-commissioner-ray-kelly-super-bowl-airing-article-1.1018204 |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> KYTV kept its analog signal on the air until June 26 to inform viewers of the [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]] through a loop of [[public service announcement]]s from the [[National Association of Broadcasters]].\n\nSchurz announced on September 14, 2015 that it would exit broadcasting and sell its television and radio stations, including KYTV, K15CZ-D (channel 15, now [[KSPR-LD]]), and the SSA with KSPR, to [[Gray Television]] for $442.5 million.<ref name=sbt-saletogray>{{cite news|title=Schurz Communications to sell WSBT and other TV, radio stations|url=http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/schurz-communications-to-sell-wsbt-and-other-tv-radio-stations/article_e95251d6-5b1d-11e5-b80b-ef330f571e57.html|accessdate=September 14, 2015|work=[[South Bend Tribune]]|date=September 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name=b&c-saletogray>{{cite news|last1=Kuperberg|first1=Jonathan|title=Gray Acquiring TV, Radio Stations from Schurz for $442.5 Million|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/gray-acquiring-tv-radio-stations-schurz-4425-million/144190|accessdate=September 14, 2015|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=September 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917040306/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/gray-acquiring-tv-radio-stations-schurz-4425-million/144190|archive-date=September 17, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The FCC approved the sale on February 12, 2016,<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/fcc-approves-gray-schurz-tv-station-deal/153781 FCC Approves Gray-Schurz TV Station Deal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804014705/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/fcc-approves-gray-schurz-tv-station-deal/153781 |date=August 4, 2017 }}.

On August 22, 2011 KYTV began producing an hour-long extension of ''Ozarks Today'' on weekday mornings from 7:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m., and a half-hour 9:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast (which expanded to one hour in June 2013) for CW affiliate KYCW-LD; this is despite the fact that the station is simulcast on the second digital subchannel of ABC-affiliated sister station KSPR-LD.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120323075427/http://www.ky3.com/news/ky3-ky3-news-will-add-7-am-and-9-pm-newscast-on-the-ozarks-cw-20110727,0,5500022.story KY3 News will add 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. newscasts on The Ozarks CW]</ref>\n\nIn 2017, KSPR's news operation was folded into KYTV's. KSPR retains unique local news broadcasts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m., while at most other times, the stations air combined newscasts. Additionally, ''Ozarks Today'' expanded to a fourth hour, airing from 8 to 9, and the KYTV noon news was extended to a full hour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kspr.com/content/news/441044093.html|work=KY3/KSPR|title=KY3, KSPR and the Ozarks CW announce changes|date=August 18, 2017|accessdate=September 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917124624/http://www.kspr.com/content/news/441044093.html|archive-date=September 17, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Norma Champion]] \u2013 former children's show host (1957\u20131986)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ky3.com/videobeta/1e045e22-01fd-48be-8c90-a666273575fe/News/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-Champion|title=Honor for Norma Champion|accessdate=July 9, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130127070751/http://www.ky3.com/videobeta/1e045e22-01fd-48be-8c90-a666273575fe/News/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-ChampionNews/honor-for-Norma-Champion|archive-date=January 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Slim Wilson]] \u2013 country music host (1964\u20131975)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:TVVpvD5ivrMJ:images.bimedia.net/documents/KY3%2BHistory1.xls|title=KY3 History|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|https://www.ky3.com/}}\n*{{URL|https://www.kspr.com/|KSPR-LD official website}}\n*{{URL|https://www.ky3.com/cwozarks|KYCW-LD/KSPR-LD2 official website}}\n*{{TVQ|KYTV}}\n\n{{Springfield MO TV}}\n{{Missouri TV}}\n{{Arkansas TV}}\n{{Gray TV}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kytv (Tv)}}\n[[Category:NBC network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Circle (TV network) affiliates]]\n[[Category:Justice Network affiliates]]\n[[Category:ABC subchannel-only network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Gray Television]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Springfield, Missouri|YTV (TV)]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1953]]\n[[Category:1953 establishments in Missouri]]\n", "name_user": "Inwind", "label": "safe", "comment": "link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KYTV_(TV)"}

There is diversity even within languages. In English, the Netherlands is also called [[Holland]] or (part of) [[the Low Countries]], whereas the term ''\"[[Dutch language|Dutch]]\"'' is used as the [[demonym]] and adjectival form. \n\n===The Netherlands and the Low Countries===\nThe region called the [[Low Countries]] (comprising [[Belgium]], the Netherlands and [[Luxembourg]]) and the Country of the Netherlands, have the same [[toponymy]]. Place names with ''Neder'' (or ''lage''), ''Nieder'', ''Nether'' (or ''low'') and ''Nedre'' (in [[Germanic languages]]) and ''Bas'' or ''Inferior'' (in [[Romance languages]]) are in use in places all over Europe. They are sometimes used in a [[deictic]] relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as ''Upper'', ''Boven'', ''Oben'', ''Superior'' or ''Haut''. In the case of the Low Countries / Netherlands the geographical location of the ''lower'' region has been more or less downstream and near the sea. The geographical location of the upper region, however, changed tremendously over time, depending on the location of the economic and military power governing the Low Countries area. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream [[Germania Inferior]] (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream [[Germania Superior]] (nowadays part of Germany). The designation 'Low' to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century Duchy of [[Lower Lorraine]], that covered much of the Low Countries.<ref name=\"Franks (Columbia Encyclopedia)\">{{cite web |url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franks.aspx |title=Franks |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |year=2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://nobhist.narod.ru/lorraine.html |title=Lotharingia / Lorraine (Lothringen) |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref> But this time the corresponding ''Upper'' region is [[Upper Lorraine]], in nowadays Northern France.\n\nThe [[Dukes of Burgundy]], who ruled the Low Countries in the 15th century, used the term ''les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' (\"the lands over here\") for the Low Countries as opposed to ''les pays de par del\u00e0'' (\"the lands over there\") for their original homeland: [[Burgundy]] in present-day east-central France.<ref name=\"BlockmansPrevenier2010\">{{cite book |author1=Wim Blockmans |author2=Walter Prevenier |title = The Promised Lands: The Low Countries Under Burgundian Rule, 1369-1530 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=0Foy9GGgdcgC&pg=PA85&dq=duke+pays+de+par+de\u00e7\u00e0#v=onepage&q=duke%20pays%20de%20par%20de\u00e7\u00e0&f=false |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-0070-6 |pages=85\u2013 }}</ref> Under [[Habsburg Netherlands|Habsburg rule]], ''Les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' developed in ''pays d'embas'' (\"lands down-here\"),<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=59Pae06JSiUC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History%3A%20Volume%202%2C%20The%20Reformation%2C%201520-1559&pg=PA342#v=onepage&q=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History:%20Volume%202,%20The%20Reformation,%201520-1559&f=false |title = The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 2, The Reformation, 1520\u20131559 |isbn = 9780521345361 |last1 = Elton |first1 = Geoffrey Rudolph |year = 1990 }}</ref> a deictic expression in relation to other Habsburg possessions like Hungary and Austria.

The area known as ''Oberland'' (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located [[Cologne]].\n\nFrom the mid-sixteenth century on, the \"Low Countries\" and the \"Netherlands\" lost their original deictic meaning. They were probably the most commonly used names, besides [[Flanders]], a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the Low Countries, especially in Romance language speaking Europe. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) divided the Low Countries into an independent northern [[Dutch Republic]] (or [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] ''Belgica Foederata'', \"Federated Netherlands\", the precursor state of the Netherlands) and a Spanish controlled [[Southern Netherlands]] (Latinised ''Belgica Regia'', \"Royal Netherlands\", the precursor state of Belgium). The Low Countries today is a designation that includes the countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, although in most [[Romance languages]], the term \"Low Countries\" is used as the name for the Netherlands specifically. It is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term [[Benelux]].\n\n===Holland===\nThe Netherlands is also referred to as [[Holland]] in various languages, including English. The region of Holland proper consists of [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]], two of the nation's twelve provinces, formerly a single province, and earlier still, the [[County of Holland]], a remnant of the dissolved [[Frisian Kingdom]]. Following the decline of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the [[County of Flanders]], Holland became the most economically and politically important county in the [[Low Countries]] region. The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Eighty Years' War]], and the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, made Holland serve as a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the entire country, which is now considered informal<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435302/Telegraph-style-book-places-and-peoples.html |title=Telegraph style book: places and peoples |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 April 2008 }}</ref> or incorrect.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=H#Holland |title=The Reuters Style Guide |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|title=The BBC News Styleguide|accessdate=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227003642/http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The use of the term Holland when referring to the whole of the Netherlands is disliked by many Dutch people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Nonetheless, the name \"Holland\" is still widely used for the [[Netherlands national football team]], including in the Netherlands,<ref>{{cite news |url = http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/07/15/styleguidepdfjuly2004.pdf |title=The Guardian style guide |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London }}</ref> and the Dutch government's international websites for tourism and trade are \"holland.com\" and \"hollandtradeandinvest.com\".<ref>[http://www.netherlands-tourism.com/netherlands-holland/ ''Netherlands Tourism''] \"Holland vs Netherlands \u2013 Is the Netherlands the same as Holland?\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exploreholland.nl/holland-vs-netherlands/|title=Holland vs Netherlands: Everything you need to know|date=2020-01-17|website=Explore Holland|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In 2020, however, the Dutch government has announced that it will only communicate and advertise under the name \"the Netherlands\" in the future.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/world/europe/holland-netherlands-new-name.html |title=Why Dutch Officials Want You to Forget the Country of Holland|date=13 January 2020|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 January 2020|location=New York City }}</ref>\n\n===Dutch===\nThe term Dutch is used as the demonymic and adjectival form of the Netherlands in the English language. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic ''*\u00feiudiskaz'', meaning \"popular\" or \"of the people\"; akin to Old Dutch ''dietsc'', Old High German ''diutsch'', and Old English ''\u00feeodisc'', all meaning \"(of) the common (Germanic) people\". At first, the English language used (the contemporary form of) Dutch to refer to any or all speakers of West Germanic languages (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians, and the Germans). Gradually its meaning shifted to the West Germanic people they had most contact with, because of their geographical proximity and for the rivalry in trade and overseas territories. The derivative of the Proto-Germanic word ''*\u00feiudiskaz'' in modern Dutch, ''Diets'', can be found in Dutch literature as a poetic name for the Dutch people or language, but is considered very archaic. It is still used in the expression \"diets maken\" - to put it straight to him/her (as in a threat) or, more neutral, to make it clear, understandable, explain, say in the people's language (cf. the Vulgate (Bible not in Greek or Hebrew, but Latin; the folks' language) in meaning vulgar, though not in a pejorative sense).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands}}\n\n===Prehistory (before 800 BCE)===\n{{Main|Paleolithic Europe|Neolithic Europe|Bronze Age Europe}}\n[[File:Mannetje van Willemstad.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Oak figurine found in [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]] (4500 BCE)]]\nThe prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography.

The southern region became dominated by the related [[Hilversum culture]] (1800\u2013800 BC), which apparently inherited cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture.\n\n===Celts, Germanic tribes and Romans (800 BC\u2013410 AD)===\n{{Main|Iron Age Europe|Celts|Germanic peoples|Romans in the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Celtic expansion in Europe.svg|thumb|150px|left|{{legend|#FFFF43|[[Diachronic linguistics|Diachronic]] distribution of [[Celtic people]] from 500 BC}}{{legend|#97FFB6|Expansion into the southern [[Low Countries]] by 270 BC}}]]\nFrom 800 BC onwards, the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]] Celtic [[Hallstatt culture]] became influential, replacing the [[Hilversum culture]].

However, as of 843, it was divided into three parts\u2014[[East Francia|East]], [[Middle Francia|Middle]], and [[West Francia]]. Most of present-day Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]], which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from [[Frisia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] in the south. Around 850, [[Lothair I]] of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking [[Rorik of Dorestad]] as ruler of most of Frisia.<ref>Baldwin, Stewart, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the [[Alps]] passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and subsequently were named [[Lotharingia]]. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into [[Upper Lotharingia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lotharingia]], the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of [[East Francia]] in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 879, another Viking raided the Frisian lands, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was [[Gerolf of Holland]], who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end.\n\n===High Middle Ages (1000\u20131384)===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Low Countries}}\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the successor state of East Francia and then Lotharingia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century, but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Gelre|Gelre]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] were in a state of almost continual war or in paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became [[Old Low Franconian]] (or [[Old Dutch]]). The rest of [[Frisia]] in the north (now [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\"), which resented the imposition of the feudal system.\n\nAround 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain [[City rights in the Low Countries|privileges]] for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]]. In practice, this meant that [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\nAround 1100 AD, farmers from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of [[Count of Holland]] was fought over in the [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy \u2014 who was also Count of Flanders \u2014 to conquer Holland.\n\n===Burgundian, Habsburg and Spanish Habsburg Netherlands (1384\u20131581)===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/2/1|align=left|total_width=250|caption_align=center\n| title = Spanish Netherlands\n| image1 = Van Soest, Four Days Battle.jpg|caption1=''The [[Four Days' Battle]], 1\u20134 June 1666'' ([[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]]) by [[Pieter Cornelisz van Soest]]\n| image2 = Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|caption2=The Low Countries in the late 14th century\n| image3 = William I, Prince of Orange by Adriaen Thomasz.

The [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the [[County of Holland]] defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. [[Amsterdam]] grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the [[Baltic region]]. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the [[peat]] of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\nUnder Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and King of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Provinces and their [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/risedutchrepubl01motlgoog|quote=On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks....

Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by [[peat]] extraction or achieved through [[land reclamation]]. Since the late 16th century, large [[polder]] areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include [[dike (construction)|dikes]], canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes.\n\nMuch of the country was originally formed by the [[estuary|estuaries]] of three large European rivers: the [[Rhine]] (''Rijn''), the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] (''Maas'') and the [[Scheldt]] (''Schelde''), as well as their [[tributary|tributaries]]. The south-western part of the Netherlands is to this day a [[river delta]] of these three rivers, the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]].\n\nThe European Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the [[Waal (river)|Waal]], its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between [[fief]]doms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their \"Great Rivers\" (''de Grote Rivieren''). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the [[IJssel]] river, discharges into [[IJsselmeer|Lake IJssel]], the former [[Zuiderzee]] ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects (except for the province of [[Friesland]], which has its own language).<ref name=\"international2000\">Welschen, Ad: Course ''Dutch Society and Culture'', International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2000\u20132005.</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n{{Main|Flood control in the Netherlands|Floods in the Netherlands|North Sea flood of 1953|Storm tides of the North Sea}}\n[[File:Christmas flood 1717.jpg|thumb|The [[Christmas flood of 1717]] was the result of a northwesterly storm that resulted in the death of thousands.]]\n\nOver the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention.\n\nOn 14 December 1287, [[St. Lucia's flood]] affected the Netherlands and Germany, killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1485002/Zuiderzee-floods Zuiderzee floods (Netherlands history)]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.</ref> The [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|St. Elizabeth flood]] of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed [[polder]], replacing it with the {{convert|72|km2|mi2|0|adj=on}} ''[[Biesbosch]]'' tidal floodplains in the south-centre. The huge [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea flood of early February 1953]] caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years.\n\n[[File:The Netherlands compared to sealevel.png|thumb|left|Map illustrating areas of the Netherlands below sea level]]\nThe impact of disasters was, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying [[swamp]]land was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile [[peat]] to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled [[peat]] extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.\n\nBecause of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.<ref>Duplessis, Robert S.

In the first millennium [[AD]], villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called ''terps''. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|waterschappen]]\"'' (\"water boards\") or ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|hoogheemraadschappen]]\"'' (\"high home councils\") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century [[windmill]]s had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous [[polder]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Windmills in Dutch History|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|website=Let.rug.nl|publisher=Rijks Universiteit Groningen|accessdate=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705084250/http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1932 the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (\"Closure Dike\") was completed, blocking the former ''[[Zuiderzee]]'' (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]] Lake).

The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the [[Maeslantkering]]. Since then, new projects have been periodically started to renovate and renew the Delta Works. A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country).

The Netherlands is actively preparing for a sea level rise. A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of {{convert|1.10|m|ft}} and a simultaneous land height decline of {{convert|10|cm|in}}. The plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defences like [[Levee|dikes]] and [[dune]]s with {{convert|1.30|m|ft}} of additional flood protection. Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the sea side, but could also alter rainfall patterns and river run-off. To protect the country from river flooding, another program is already being executed. The [[Room for the River (Netherlands)|Room for the River plan]] grants more flow space to rivers, protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands.

Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in summer, when lightning is also much more frequent).\n\nThe number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude, the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June.\n\nThe following tables are based on mean measurements by the [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] weather station in [[De Bilt]] between 1981 and 2010.

Most of these are owned by [[Staatsbosbeheer]], the national department for [[forestry]] and [[Habitat conservation|nature conservation]] and [[Vereniging Natuurmonumenten|Natuurmonumenten]] (literally 'Natures monuments'), a private organisation that buys, protects and manages nature reserves. The Dutch part of the [[Wadden Sea]] in the north, with its [[tidal flat]]s and [[wetland]]s, is rich in [[biodiversity|biological diversity]], and was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Nature Site]] in 2009.\n\n[[File:Phoca vitulina Terschelling.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harbor seal|Common seals]] on [[Terschelling]], a [[Wadden Sea]] island]]\nThe [[Oosterschelde]], formerly the northeast [[estuary]] of the river [[Scheldt]] was designated a national park in 2002, thereby making it the largest national park in the Netherlands at an area of {{convert|370|km2|sqmi}}. It consists primarily of the salt waters of the Oosterschelde, but also includes mud flats, meadows, and shoals. Because of the large variety of sea life, including unique regional species, the park is popular with [[Scuba diving|Scuba divers]]. Other activities include sailing, fishing, cycling, and bird watching.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the European Netherlands is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the European territory of the Netherlands belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Atlantic mixed forests. In 1871, the last old original natural woods were cut down, and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like [[Scots pine]] and trees that are not native to the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These woods were planted on [[heath (habitat)#Anthropogenic heaths|anthropogenic heaths]] and sand-drifts (overgrazed heaths) ([[Veluwe]]).\n\n===Caribbean islands===\n{{Main|Bonaire|Saba|Sint Eustatius}}\nWhile [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Aruba]] and [[Sint Maarten]] have a [[Constituent state|constituent country]] status, the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] are three islands designated as special municipalities of the Netherlands.

Although in the English language they are considered part of the [[Leeward Islands]], French, Spanish, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the English spoken locally consider them part of the [[Windward Islands]]. The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for [[agriculture]]. The highest point is [[Mount Scenery]], {{convert|887|m|ft|0}}, on [[Saba]]. This is the highest point in the country, and is also the highest point of the entire [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].\n\nThe islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a [[tropical]] [[climate]] with warm weather all year round.

The Netherlands is described as a [[consociational state]]. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the 11th [[Democracy Index|most democratic country in the world]].\n\nThe [[Dutch monarchy|monarch]] is the [[head of state]], at present King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]]. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers.<!-- Commented out: \"The monarch can exert some influence during the formation of a new cabinet, where they serve as neutral arbiter between the political parties.\" INFO: The Dutch Lower House (Tweede Kamer) relieved the monarch of this role on 27 March 2012. --> By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs. Depending on the personalities and relationships of the King and the ministers, the monarch might have influence beyond the power granted by the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n | caption_align     = center\n | image1            = Koning-willem-alexander-okt-15-s.jpg\n | width1            = 172\n | caption1          = [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]<br /><small>[[Monarchy of the Netherlands|King of the Netherlands]]<br />since 30 April 2013</small>\n | image2            = Mark Rutte-6.jpg\n | width2            = 180\n | caption2          = [[Mark Rutte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]<br />since 14 October 2010</small>\n}}\nThe [[Executive (government)|executive power]] is formed by the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]], the deliberative organ of the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch cabinet]]. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|state secretaries]]. One to three ministers are [[Minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. [[Mark Rutte]] has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973.\n\nThe cabinet is [[Ministerial responsibility|responsible]] to the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], which also has [[Legislative|legislative powers]]. The 150 members of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]], are elected in [[direct election]]s on the basis of [[party-list proportional representation]]. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls (for example: when one of the chambers carries a [[motion of no confidence]], the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The [[States-Provincial]] are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], the [[upper house]], which has the power to reject laws, but not propose or amend them. Both houses send members to the [[Benelux Parliament]], a consultative council.\n\n===Political culture===\nBoth trade unions and [[employers organisation]]s are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the [[Social-Economic Council]]. This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long tradition of [[Toleration|social tolerance]].<ref name=\"Singh2010\">{{cite book|author=Shiva Pratap Singh|title=Glimpses of Europe: A Crucible of Winning Ideas, Great Civilizations and Bloodiest Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPMkaHfHLRgC&pg=PA579|year=2010|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-831-4|pages=579\u2013}}</ref> In the 18th century, while the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was the [[state religion]], [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholicism]], other forms of Protestantism, such as Baptists and Lutherans, as well as [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Judaism]] were tolerated but discriminated against.<ref name=\"Singh2010\"/>\n\n[[File:Red-light district of Amsterdam by day. 2012.JPG|thumb|250px|[[De Wallen]], Amsterdam's [[Red-light district]], offers activities such as legal [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]] and a number of [[coffee shops]] that sell [[marijuana]], symbolising the Dutch political culture and tradition of tolerance.]]\nIn the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of [[pillarisation]], in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government. This tradition of tolerance influences Dutch [[criminal justice system of the Netherlands|criminal justice]] policies on [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|recreational drugs]], [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]], [[LGBT rights in the Netherlands|LGBT rights]], [[euthanasia]], and [[abortion in the Netherlands|abortion]], which are among the most liberal in the world.\n\n===Political parties===\n{{Main|Political parties of the Netherlands|Politics of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Ineke van Gent, Han ten Broeke en Kees Verhoeven, Lancering Europese Mobiliteitsweek 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The Netherlands has a culture of respectful and friendly debate.

Since suffrage became universal [[Pacification of 1917|in 1917]], the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democrats]], currently represented by the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA); second were the [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], represented by the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA); and third were the [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|Liberals]], of which the right-wing [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is the main representative.\n\nThese parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian Democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals. In the 1970s, the [[party system]] became more volatile: the Christian Democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical democrat]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) or the [[Ecology|ecologist]] party [[GroenLinks]] (GL).\n\nIn the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]], the CDA lost its dominant position. A \"[[Purple (government)|purple]]\" cabinet was formed by the VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 elections]], this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn|LPF]], a new political party, around [[Pim Fortuyn]], who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA Leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2003|2003 elections]], in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a [[Balkenende II|cabinet]] was formed by the CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the [[welfare state]], the [[Healthcare in the Netherlands|healthcare system]], and [[Border control#Immigration policy|immigration policy]].\n\nIn June 2006, the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the [[Ministry of Justice and Security (Netherlands)|Minister of Immigration and Integration]], [[Rita Verdonk]], who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a VVD [[Member of parliament|MP]]. A [[Third Balkenende cabinet|caretaker cabinet]] was formed by the CDA and VVD, and [[Dutch general election, 2006|general elections]] were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] made the largest gains. The [[2006\u201307 Dutch cabinet formation|formation of a new cabinet]] took three months, resulting in a [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-4|coalition]] of CDA, PvdA, and [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]].\n\nOn 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in [[Uruzgan]], Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kabinet valt over Uruzgan-besluit |newspaper=[[De Volkskrant]] |date=20 February 2010 |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223041947/http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archivedate=23 February 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |author1=Dirks, Bart |author2=Koel\u00e9, Theo |lastauthoramp=yes |language=Dutch |url-status=dead  }}</ref> [[Snap election]]s were held on [[Dutch general election, 2010|9 June 2010]], with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats.

relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of the Netherlands|List of diplomatic missions of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] (''Vredespaleis''), in [[The Hague]]]]\nThe history of [[foreign relations of the Netherlands|Dutch foreign policy]] has been characterised by its [[neutral state|neutrality]]. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, [[NATO]] and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on [[international trade]].\n\nThe [[foreign policy]] of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to [[atlanticism|Atlantic co-operation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]]. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|liberal policy towards soft drugs]].\n\nDuring and after the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]]. Indonesia became independent after the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s. Suriname became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. In addition, many people from these countries are living permanently in the Netherlands.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Armed forces of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Rob Bauer.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant admiral [[Rob Bauer]] is the current [[Chief of Defence (Netherlands)|Chief of Defence]].]]\nThe Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by [[Maurice of Nassau]] in the late 1500s. The Dutch army was used throughout the [[Dutch Empire]]. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a [[conscription]] army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands was invaded in World War II]] and defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.\n\n[[File:HNLMS Holland.jpg|thumb|''Zr. Ms. Holland'', a [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] [[offshore patrol vessel]]]]\nThe Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and became a founding member of [[NATO]] in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in [[Cold War]] Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Kosovo War]], it held a province in [[Iraq]] after the defeat of [[Saddam Hussein]], and it was engaged in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]].\n\nThe military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix ''Koninklijke'' (Royal):\n<!-- Pls do not change any of these from 'Royal Netherlands' to 'Dutch', the official name of ALL branches of the Army is Royal Netherlands-->\n* ''Koninklijke Marine'' (KM), the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps;\n* ''Koninklijke Landmacht'' (KL), the [[Royal Netherlands Army]];\n* ''Koninklijke Luchtmacht'' (KLu), the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]];\n* ''Koninklijke Marechaussee'' (KMar), the [[Royal Marechaussee]] (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control.\n\nThe submarine service is open to women as of 1 January 2017.

It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education. After completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream.\n\nThe [[Voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|VMBO]] has 4 grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the vmbo results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade, or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The [[Hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs|HAVO]] has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are [[Vocational university|universities of professional education]] (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. A HBO degree gives access to the university system. The [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]] (comprising [[Atheneum (school)|atheneum]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer of a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a four or five-year [[doctoral degree]] program.\n\nDoctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools that are publicly funded but not managed by the state even though requirements are necessary for the funding to be authorised. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the European Union. The amount is about 10,000 euros for non-EU students.\n\n===Healthcare===\n{{Main|Healthcare in the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723).

The Netherlands has been among the top three countries in each report published since 2005. On 48 indicators such as patient rights and information, accessibility, prevention and outcomes, the Netherlands secured its top position among 37 European countries for six years in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse|work=healthpowerhouse.com|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe Netherlands was ranked first in a study in 2009 comparing the [[health care system]]s of the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65M0SU20100623 | work=Reuters | title=U.S. scores dead last again in healthcare study | date=23 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110040524/http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 January 2012|title=Toward Higher-Performance Health Systems: Adults' Health Care Experiences In Seven Countries, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEver since a major reform of the health care system in 2006, the Dutch system received more points in the Index each year. According to the HCP ([[Health Consumer Powerhouse]]), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. The difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://healthpowerhouse.com/|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse \u2013 Health Care System's Indexes and reports}}</ref>\n\nHealth insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:\n* Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW), often called \"basic insurance\", covers common medical care.\n* Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care.\n\nWhile Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If a person decides not to carry out an insurance coverage, the person may be fined. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health \u2013 it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (''huisartsen'', comparable to [[general practitioner]]s) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.<ref name=\"Boot\">J.M.

Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the ''[[AWBZ|Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]]'' (\"General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs\") which first came into effect in 1968. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses.<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=71914ned&D1=37-43&D2=a&HDR=G1&STB=T&VW=T|title=Zorgrekeningen; uitgaven (in lopende en constante prijzen) en financiering|date=20 May 2010|publisher=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek: StatLine|language=Dutch|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor all regular (short-term) medical treatment, there is a system of obligatory [[health insurance]], with private health insurance companies. These insurance companies are obliged to provide a package with a defined set of insured treatments.<ref name=\"minvws.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.minvws.nl/en/themes/health-insurance-system/|title=Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport|first=Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en|last=Sport|work=minvws.nl|accessdate=26 August 2016|date=18 February 2010}}</ref> This insurance covers 41% of all health care expenses.<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\"/>\n\nOther sources of health care payment are taxes (14%), out of pocket payments (9%), additional optional health insurance packages (4%) and a range of other sources (4%).<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\"/> Affordability is guaranteed through a system of income-related allowances and individual and employer-paid income-related premiums.\n\nA key feature of the Dutch system is that premiums may not be related to health status or age. Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through [[Risk equalization|risk equalisation]] and a common [[risk pool]]. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about \u20ac100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and \u20ac150 or US$196 in 2012), with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and a yearly deductible of \u20ac220 (US$288).\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Hollande04.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Some symbols and icons of Dutch culture</div>]]\n\n===Art, philosophy and literature===\n{{Main|Dutch art|Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch literature}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=2/1/1|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Meisje met de parel.jpg|caption1=''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]\n| image2 = Vincent van Gogh - Self-portrait with grey felt hat - Google Art Project.jpg|caption2=Self-portrait by [[Vincent van Gogh]]\n| image3 = Rijksmuseum 2022.jpg|caption3=The [[Rijksmuseum]]\n| image4 = NEMO and area.jpg|caption4=The National [[NEMO (museum)|NEMO Science Museum]] and the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] in second plan, in Amsterdam\n}}\n\nThe Netherlands has had many well-known painters.

Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century were [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]]. [[M. C. Escher]] is a well-known graphics artist. [[Willem de Kooning]] was born and trained in [[Rotterdam]], although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist.\n\nThe Netherlands is the country of philosophers [[Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].

The Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) discovered [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], argued that light travelled as waves, invented the [[pendulum clock]] and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe and describe [[Microorganism|single-celled organisms]] with a [[microscope]].\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], literature flourished as well, with [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P. C. Hooft]] as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, [[Multatuli]] wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch colony, the current Indonesia. Important 20th century authors include [[Godfried Bomans]], [[Harry Mulisch]], [[Jan Wolkers]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Hella S. Haasse]], [[Cees Nooteboom]], [[Gerard Reve]] and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]. [[Anne Frank]]'s [[The Diary of a Young Girl|''Diary of a Young Girl'']] was published after she was murdered in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.\n\nThe traditional Dutch architecture is especially valued in [[Amsterdam]], [[Delft]] and [[Leiden]], with 17 and 18th century buildings along the canals. Smaller village architecture with wooden houses is found in [[Zaandam]] and [[Marken]]. Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in [[Huis Ten Bosch (theme park)|Huis Ten Bosch]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. A similar Holland Village is being built in [[Shenyang]], [[China]].

Some of the world's best known dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Ti\u00ebsto]], [[Hardwell]], [[Martin Garrix]], [[Dash Berlin]], [[Julian Jordan]], [[Nicky Romero]], [[W&W]], [[Don Diablo]] and [[Afrojack]]; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by [[DJ Mag Top 100 DJs]]. The [[Amsterdam Dance Event]] (ADE) is the world's leading electronic music conference and the biggest club festival for the many electronic subgenres on the planet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.local-life.com/amsterdam/articles/amsterdam-dance-event|title=Amsterdam Dance Event|work=local-life.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchdailynews.com/the-international-dance-industry-assembles-in-amsterdam-next-week/|title=The international Dance industry assembles in Amsterdam next week|work=Dutch Daily News|date=12 October 2012}}</ref> These DJs also contribute to the world's mainstream pop music, as they frequently collaborate and produce for high-profile international artists.\n\nThe Netherlands have [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|participated]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] since its first edition in 1956, and have won five times.

Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A [[NOC*NSF|Dutch National Olympic Committee]] was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 110 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. In international competition, Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands women's field hockey team]] is the most successful team in [[Women's Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] history. The [[Netherlands national baseball team|Netherlands baseball team]] have won the [[European Baseball Championship|European championship]] 20 times out of 32 events. Dutch [[K-1]] [[Kickboxing|kickboxers]] have won the [[K-1 World Grand Prix]] 15 times out of 19 tournaments.\n\nThe Dutch [[Speed skating|speed skaters']] performance at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], where they won 8 out of 12 events, 23 out of 36 medals, including 4 clean sweeps, is the most dominant performance in a single sport in Olympic history. Motorcycle racing at the [[TT Circuit Assen]] has a long history. Assen is the only venue to have held a round of the Motorcycle World Championship every year since its creation in 1949. The circuit was purpose-built for the Dutch TT in 1954, with previous events having been held on public roads.\n\nThe Dutch have also had success in all three of cyclings Grand Tours with [[Jan Janssen]] winning the [[1968 Tour de France]], more recently with [[Tom Dumoulin]] winning the [[2017 Giro d'Italia]] and legendary rider [[Joop Zoetemelk]] was the 1985 UCI World Champion, the winner of the [[1979 Vuelta a Espana]], the [[1980 Tour de France]] and still holds or shares numerous [[Tour de France]] records including most Tours finished and most kilometers ridden.\n\nLimburger [[Max Verstappen]] currently races in [[Formula One]], and [[2016 Spanish Grand Prix|was the first Dutchman to win a Grand Prix]].

Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables. The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]], with most [[global cuisine]]s being represented in the major cities.\n\nModern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. The regions in the northeast of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]], [[Drenthe]], [[Overijssel]] and [[Gelderland]] north of the [[Grote rivieren|great rivers]] are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of [[game (meat)|game]] and [[Animal husbandry|husbandry]], though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the [[IJsselmeer]] also include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the [[metworst]]-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Also smoked sausages are common, of which (''Gelderse'') ''[[rookworst]]'' is the most renowned. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside ''[[stamppot]]'', ''[[hutspot]]'' or ''zuurkool'' ([[sauerkraut]]); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a [[street food]]. The provinces are also home to hard textured [[rye bread]], pastries and cookies, the latter heavily spiced with [[ginger]] or [[succade]] or contain small bits of meat. Various kinds of ''Kruidkoek'' (such as [[:nl:Groninger koek|Groninger koek]]), ''[[:nl:Fryske d\u00famkes|Fryske d\u00famkes]]'' and ''[[:nl:spekdik|spekdikken]]'' (small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron) are considered typical. Notable characteristics of ''Fries roggebrood'' (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warenkennis.nl/graan/soorten.htm|title=Graansoorten|website=Warenkennis.nl|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many [[bitters]] (such as ''[[Beerenburg]]'') and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from ''[[Jenever]]'', typical for the rest of the country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. ''Friese Nagelkaas'' ([[Friesian Clove]]) is a notable example.\n\nThe provinces of [[North Holland]], [[South Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and the Gelderlandic area of [[Betuwe]] make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the abundance of water and flat grasslands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]], [[Leyden cheese|Leyden]] (spiced cheese with cumin), and [[Edam (cheese)|Edam]] (traditionally in small spheres) as well as [[Leerdammer]] and [[Beemster Cheese|Beemster]], while the adjacent [[Zaanstreek]] in [[North Holland]] has since the 16th century beem known for its [[mayonnaise]], typical whole-grain [[mustard (condiment)|mustards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smulweb.nl/blog/tonia/718/de-geschiedenis-van-de-mosterd|title=De geschiedenis van de mosterd - Smulweb Blog|date=5 May 2000}}</ref> and [[chocolate]] industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of [[milkfat]] than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, ''karnemelk'' ([[buttermilk]]), is also considered typical for this region. [[Seafood]] such as [[soused herring]], [[Blue mussel|mussels]] (called ''Zeeuwse Mossels'', since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's [[Oosterschelde]]), [[European eel|eels]], [[oyster]]s and [[shrimp]]s are widely available and typical for the region. ''[[:nl:Kibbeling|Kibbeling]]'', once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], has become a national [[fast food]], just as [[:nl:Lekkerbekje|lekkerbek]]. Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The ''[[oliebol]]'' (in its modern form) and ''[[Zeeuwse bolus]]'' are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like ''[[stroopwafel]]'', as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like ''[[:nl:Gevulde koek|gevulde koek]]''. The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are [[beer]] (strong pale lager) and ''[[Jenever]]'', a high proof [[juniper]]-flavored spirit, that came to be known in England as [[gin]]. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, ''[[Advocaat]]'', a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.\n\nThe Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and the [[Flemish Region]] in [[Belgium]]. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an [[haute cuisine]]. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the ''[[Vlaai]]'' from Limburg and the ''Moorkop'' and ''[[Bossche Bol]]'' from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the {{lang|nl|worstenbroodje}} (a roll with a sausage of [[ground beef]], literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from ''[[Trappist beer|Trappist]]'' to ''[[Kriek lambic|Kriek]]''. 5 of the 10 ''International Trappist Association'' recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews.\n\nIn early 2014, [[Oxfam]] ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=14 January 2014 |title=Netherlands is country with most plentiful, healthy food: Oxfam |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/15/us-food-countries-idUSBREA0E01S20140115 |newspaper= |location=New York |publisher=Reuters U.S. |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Good Enough to Eat \u2013 Media Briefing|url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Good_Enough_To_Eat_Media_brief_FINAL.pdf |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Oxfam]] America |agency= |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial heritage===\n{{Main|Dutch Empire}}\n{{further|Dutch East Indies|Indos in the Dutch East Indies}}\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[New Amsterdam]] as it appeared in 1664.

There is diversity even within languages. In English, the Netherlands is also called [[Holland]] or (part of) [[the Low Countries]], whereas the term ''\"[[Dutch language|Dutch]]\"'' is used as the [[demonym]] and adjectival form. \n\n===The Netherlands and the Low Countries===\nThe region called the [[Low Countries]] (comprising [[Belgium]], the Netherlands and [[Luxembourg]]) and the Country of the Netherlands, have the same [[toponymy]]. Place names with ''Neder'' (or ''lage''), ''Nieder'', ''Nether'' (or ''low'') and ''Nedre'' (in [[Germanic languages]]) and ''Bas'' or ''Inferior'' (in [[Romance languages]]) are in use in places all over Europe. They are sometimes used in a [[deictic]] relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as ''Upper'', ''Boven'', ''Oben'', ''Superior'' or ''Haut''. In the case of the Low Countries / Netherlands the geographical location of the ''lower'' region has been more or less downstream and near the sea. The geographical location of the upper region, however, changed tremendously over time, depending on the location of the economic and military power governing the Low Countries area. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream [[Germania Inferior]] (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream [[Germania Superior]] (nowadays part of Germany). The designation 'Low' to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century Duchy of [[Lower Lorraine]], that covered much of the Low Countries.<ref name=\"Franks (Columbia Encyclopedia)\">{{cite web |url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franks.aspx |title=Franks |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |year=2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://nobhist.narod.ru/lorraine.html |title=Lotharingia / Lorraine (Lothringen) |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref> But this time the corresponding ''Upper'' region is [[Upper Lorraine]], in nowadays Northern France.\n\nThe [[Dukes of Burgundy]], who ruled the Low Countries in the 15th century, used the term ''les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' (\"the lands over here\") for the Low Countries as opposed to ''les pays de par del\u00e0'' (\"the lands over there\") for their original homeland: [[Burgundy]] in present-day east-central France.<ref name=\"BlockmansPrevenier2010\">{{cite book |author1=Wim Blockmans |author2=Walter Prevenier |title = The Promised Lands: The Low Countries Under Burgundian Rule, 1369-1530 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=0Foy9GGgdcgC&pg=PA85&dq=duke+pays+de+par+de\u00e7\u00e0#v=onepage&q=duke%20pays%20de%20par%20de\u00e7\u00e0&f=false |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-0070-6 |pages=85\u2013 }}</ref> Under [[Habsburg Netherlands|Habsburg rule]], ''Les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' developed in ''pays d'embas'' (\"lands down-here\"),<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=59Pae06JSiUC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History%3A%20Volume%202%2C%20The%20Reformation%2C%201520-1559&pg=PA342#v=onepage&q=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History:%20Volume%202,%20The%20Reformation,%201520-1559&f=false |title = The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 2, The Reformation, 1520\u20131559 |isbn = 9780521345361 |last1 = Elton |first1 = Geoffrey Rudolph |year = 1990 }}</ref> a deictic expression in relation to other Habsburg possessions like Hungary and Austria.

The area known as ''Oberland'' (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located [[Cologne]].\n\nFrom the mid-sixteenth century on, the \"Low Countries\" and the \"Netherlands\" lost their original deictic meaning. They were probably the most commonly used names, besides [[Flanders]], a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the Low Countries, especially in Romance language speaking Europe. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) divided the Low Countries into an independent northern [[Dutch Republic]] (or [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] ''Belgica Foederata'', \"Federated Netherlands\", the precursor state of the Netherlands) and a Spanish controlled [[Southern Netherlands]] (Latinised ''Belgica Regia'', \"Royal Netherlands\", the precursor state of Belgium). The Low Countries today is a designation that includes the countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, although in most [[Romance languages]], the term \"Low Countries\" is used as the name for the Netherlands specifically. It is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term [[Benelux]].\n\n===Holland===\nThe Netherlands is also referred to as [[Holland]] in various languages, including English. The region of Holland proper consists of [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]], two of the nation's twelve provinces, formerly a single province, and earlier still, the [[County of Holland]], a remnant of the dissolved [[Frisian Kingdom]]. Following the decline of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the [[County of Flanders]], Holland became the most economically and politically important county in the [[Low Countries]] region. The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Eighty Years' War]], and the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, made Holland serve as a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the entire country, which is now considered informal<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435302/Telegraph-style-book-places-and-peoples.html |title=Telegraph style book: places and peoples |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 April 2008 }}</ref> or incorrect.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=H#Holland |title=The Reuters Style Guide |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|title=The BBC News Styleguide|accessdate=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227003642/http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The use of the term Holland when referring to the whole of the Netherlands is disliked by many Dutch people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Nonetheless, the name \"Holland\" is still widely used for the [[Netherlands national football team]], including in the Netherlands,<ref>{{cite news |url = http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/07/15/styleguidepdfjuly2004.pdf |title=The Guardian style guide |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London }}</ref> and the Dutch government's international websites for tourism and trade are \"holland.com\" and \"hollandtradeandinvest.com\".<ref>[http://www.netherlands-tourism.com/netherlands-holland/ ''Netherlands Tourism''] \"Holland vs Netherlands \u2013 Is the Netherlands the same as Holland?\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exploreholland.nl/holland-vs-netherlands/|title=Holland vs Netherlands: Everything you need to know|date=2020-01-17|website=Explore Holland|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In 2020, however, the Dutch government has announced that it will only communicate and advertise under the name \"the Netherlands\" in the future.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/world/europe/holland-netherlands-new-name.html |title=Why Dutch Officials Want You to Forget the Country of Holland|date=13 January 2020|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 January 2020|location=New York City }}</ref>\n\n===Dutch===\nThe term Dutch is used as the demonymic and adjectival form of the Netherlands in the English language. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic ''*\u00feiudiskaz'', meaning \"popular\" or \"of the people\"; akin to Old Dutch ''dietsc'', Old High German ''diutsch'', and Old English ''\u00feeodisc'', all meaning \"(of) the common (Germanic) people\". At first, the English language used (the contemporary form of) Dutch to refer to any or all speakers of West Germanic languages (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians, and the Germans). Gradually its meaning shifted to the West Germanic people they had most contact with, because of their geographical proximity and for the rivalry in trade and overseas territories. The derivative of the Proto-Germanic word ''*\u00feiudiskaz'' in modern Dutch, ''Diets'', can be found in Dutch literature as a poetic name for the Dutch people or language, but is considered very archaic. It is still used in the expression \"diets maken\" - to put it straight to him/her (as in a threat) or, more neutral, to make it clear, understandable, explain, say in the people's language (cf. the Vulgate (Bible not in Greek or Hebrew, but Latin; the folks' language) in meaning vulgar, though not in a pejorative sense).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands}}\n\n===Prehistory (before 800 BCE)===\n{{Main|Paleolithic Europe|Neolithic Europe|Bronze Age Europe}}\n[[File:Mannetje van Willemstad.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Oak figurine found in [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]] (4500 BCE)]]\nThe prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography.

The southern region became dominated by the related [[Hilversum culture]] (1800\u2013800 BC), which apparently inherited cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture.\n\n===Celts, Germanic tribes and Romans (800 BC\u2013410 AD)===\n{{Main|Iron Age Europe|Celts|Germanic peoples|Romans in the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Celtic expansion in Europe.svg|thumb|150px|left|{{legend|#FFFF43|[[Diachronic linguistics|Diachronic]] distribution of [[Celtic people]] from 500 BC}}{{legend|#97FFB6|Expansion into the southern [[Low Countries]] by 270 BC}}]]\nFrom 800 BC onwards, the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]] Celtic [[Hallstatt culture]] became influential, replacing the [[Hilversum culture]].

However, as of 843, it was divided into three parts\u2014[[East Francia|East]], [[Middle Francia|Middle]], and [[West Francia]]. Most of present-day Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]], which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from [[Frisia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] in the south. Around 850, [[Lothair I]] of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking [[Rorik of Dorestad]] as ruler of most of Frisia.<ref>Baldwin, Stewart, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the [[Alps]] passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and subsequently were named [[Lotharingia]]. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into [[Upper Lotharingia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lotharingia]], the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of [[East Francia]] in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 879, another Viking raided the Frisian lands, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was [[Gerolf of Holland]], who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end.\n\n===High Middle Ages (1000\u20131384)===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Low Countries}}\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the successor state of East Francia and then Lotharingia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century, but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Gelre|Gelre]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] were in a state of almost continual war or in paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became [[Old Low Franconian]] (or [[Old Dutch]]). The rest of [[Frisia]] in the north (now [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\"), which resented the imposition of the feudal system.\n\nAround 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain [[City rights in the Low Countries|privileges]] for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]]. In practice, this meant that [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\nAround 1100 AD, farmers from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of [[Count of Holland]] was fought over in the [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy \u2014 who was also Count of Flanders \u2014 to conquer Holland.\n\n===Burgundian, Habsburg and Spanish Habsburg Netherlands (1384\u20131581)===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/2/1|align=left|total_width=250|caption_align=center\n| title = Spanish Netherlands\n| image1 = Van Soest, Four Days Battle.jpg|caption1=''The [[Four Days' Battle]], 1\u20134 June 1666'' ([[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]]) by [[Pieter Cornelisz van Soest]]\n| image2 = Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|caption2=The Low Countries in the late 14th century\n| image3 = William I, Prince of Orange by Adriaen Thomasz.

The [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the [[County of Holland]] defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. [[Amsterdam]] grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the [[Baltic region]]. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the [[peat]] of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\nUnder Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and King of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Provinces and their [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/risedutchrepubl01motlgoog|quote=On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks....

Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by [[peat]] extraction or achieved through [[land reclamation]]. Since the late 16th century, large [[polder]] areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include [[dike (construction)|dikes]], canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes.\n\nMuch of the country was originally formed by the [[estuary|estuaries]] of three large European rivers: the [[Rhine]] (''Rijn''), the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] (''Maas'') and the [[Scheldt]] (''Schelde''), as well as their [[tributary|tributaries]]. The south-western part of the Netherlands is to this day a [[river delta]] of these three rivers, the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]].\n\nThe European Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the [[Waal (river)|Waal]], its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between [[fief]]doms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their \"Great Rivers\" (''de Grote Rivieren''). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the [[IJssel]] river, discharges into [[IJsselmeer|Lake IJssel]], the former [[Zuiderzee]] ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects (except for the province of [[Friesland]], which has its own language).<ref name=\"international2000\">Welschen, Ad: Course ''Dutch Society and Culture'', International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2000\u20132005.</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n{{Main|Flood control in the Netherlands|Floods in the Netherlands|North Sea flood of 1953|Storm tides of the North Sea}}\n[[File:Christmas flood 1717.jpg|thumb|The [[Christmas flood of 1717]] was the result of a northwesterly storm that resulted in the death of thousands.]]\n\nOver the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention.\n\nOn 14 December 1287, [[St. Lucia's flood]] affected the Netherlands and Germany, killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1485002/Zuiderzee-floods Zuiderzee floods (Netherlands history)]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.</ref> The [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|St. Elizabeth flood]] of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed [[polder]], replacing it with the {{convert|72|km2|mi2|0|adj=on}} ''[[Biesbosch]]'' tidal floodplains in the south-centre. The huge [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea flood of early February 1953]] caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years.\n\n[[File:The Netherlands compared to sealevel.png|thumb|left|Map illustrating areas of the Netherlands below sea level]]\nThe impact of disasters was, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying [[swamp]]land was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile [[peat]] to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled [[peat]] extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.\n\nBecause of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.<ref>Duplessis, Robert S.

In the first millennium [[AD]], villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called ''terps''. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|waterschappen]]\"'' (\"water boards\") or ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|hoogheemraadschappen]]\"'' (\"high home councils\") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century [[windmill]]s had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous [[polder]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Windmills in Dutch History|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|website=Let.rug.nl|publisher=Rijks Universiteit Groningen|accessdate=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705084250/http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1932 the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (\"Closure Dike\") was completed, blocking the former ''[[Zuiderzee]]'' (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]] Lake).

The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the [[Maeslantkering]]. Since then, new projects have been periodically started to renovate and renew the Delta Works. A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country).

The Netherlands is actively preparing for a sea level rise. A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of {{convert|1.10|m|ft}} and a simultaneous land height decline of {{convert|10|cm|in}}. The plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defences like [[Levee|dikes]] and [[dune]]s with {{convert|1.30|m|ft}} of additional flood protection. Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the sea side, but could also alter rainfall patterns and river run-off. To protect the country from river flooding, another program is already being executed. The [[Room for the River (Netherlands)|Room for the River plan]] grants more flow space to rivers, protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands.

Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in summer, when lightning is also much more frequent).\n\nThe number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude, the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June.\n\nThe following tables are based on mean measurements by the [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] weather station in [[De Bilt]] between 1981 and 2010.

Most of these are owned by [[Staatsbosbeheer]], the national department for [[forestry]] and [[Habitat conservation|nature conservation]] and [[Vereniging Natuurmonumenten|Natuurmonumenten]] (literally 'Natures monuments'), a private organisation that buys, protects and manages nature reserves. The Dutch part of the [[Wadden Sea]] in the north, with its [[tidal flat]]s and [[wetland]]s, is rich in [[biodiversity|biological diversity]], and was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Nature Site]] in 2009.\n\n[[File:Phoca vitulina Terschelling.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harbor seal|Common seals]] on [[Terschelling]], a [[Wadden Sea]] island]]\nThe [[Oosterschelde]], formerly the northeast [[estuary]] of the river [[Scheldt]] was designated a national park in 2002, thereby making it the largest national park in the Netherlands at an area of {{convert|370|km2|sqmi}}. It consists primarily of the salt waters of the Oosterschelde, but also includes mud flats, meadows, and shoals. Because of the large variety of sea life, including unique regional species, the park is popular with [[Scuba diving|Scuba divers]]. Other activities include sailing, fishing, cycling, and bird watching.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the European Netherlands is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the European territory of the Netherlands belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Atlantic mixed forests. In 1871, the last old original natural woods were cut down, and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like [[Scots pine]] and trees that are not native to the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These woods were planted on [[heath (habitat)#Anthropogenic heaths|anthropogenic heaths]] and sand-drifts (overgrazed heaths) ([[Veluwe]]).\n\n===Caribbean islands===\n{{Main|Bonaire|Saba|Sint Eustatius}}\nWhile [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Aruba]] and [[Sint Maarten]] have a [[Constituent state|constituent country]] status, the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] are three islands designated as special municipalities of the Netherlands.

Although in the English language they are considered part of the [[Leeward Islands]], French, Spanish, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the English spoken locally consider them part of the [[Windward Islands]]. The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for [[agriculture]]. The highest point is [[Mount Scenery]], {{convert|887|m|ft|0}}, on [[Saba]]. This is the highest point in the country, and is also the highest point of the entire [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].\n\nThe islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a [[tropical]] [[climate]] with warm weather all year round.

The Netherlands is described as a [[consociational state]]. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the 11th [[Democracy Index|most democratic country in the world]].\n\nThe [[Dutch monarchy|monarch]] is the [[head of state]], at present King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]]. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers.<!-- Commented out: \"The monarch can exert some influence during the formation of a new cabinet, where they serve as neutral arbiter between the political parties.\" INFO: The Dutch Lower House (Tweede Kamer) relieved the monarch of this role on 27 March 2012. --> By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs. Depending on the personalities and relationships of the King and the ministers, the monarch might have influence beyond the power granted by the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n | caption_align     = center\n | image1            = Koning-willem-alexander-okt-15-s.jpg\n | width1            = 172\n | caption1          = [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]<br /><small>[[Monarchy of the Netherlands|King of the Netherlands]]<br />since 30 April 2013</small>\n | image2            = Mark Rutte-6.jpg\n | width2            = 180\n | caption2          = [[Mark Rutte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]<br />since 14 October 2010</small>\n}}\nThe [[Executive (government)|executive power]] is formed by the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]], the deliberative organ of the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch cabinet]]. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|state secretaries]]. One to three ministers are [[Minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. [[Mark Rutte]] has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973.\n\nThe cabinet is [[Ministerial responsibility|responsible]] to the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], which also has [[Legislative|legislative powers]]. The 150 members of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]], are elected in [[direct election]]s on the basis of [[party-list proportional representation]]. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls (for example: when one of the chambers carries a [[motion of no confidence]], the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The [[States-Provincial]] are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], the [[upper house]], which has the power to reject laws, but not propose or amend them. Both houses send members to the [[Benelux Parliament]], a consultative council.\n\n===Political culture===\nBoth trade unions and [[employers organisation]]s are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the [[Social-Economic Council]]. This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long tradition of [[Toleration|social tolerance]].<ref name=\"Singh2010\">{{cite book|author=Shiva Pratap Singh|title=Glimpses of Europe: A Crucible of Winning Ideas, Great Civilizations and Bloodiest Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPMkaHfHLRgC&pg=PA579|year=2010|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-831-4|pages=579\u2013}}</ref> In the 18th century, while the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was the [[state religion]], [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholicism]], other forms of Protestantism, such as Baptists and Lutherans, as well as [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Judaism]] were tolerated but discriminated against.<ref name=\"Singh2010\"/>\n\n[[File:Red-light district of Amsterdam by day. 2012.JPG|thumb|250px|[[De Wallen]], Amsterdam's [[Red-light district]], offers activities such as legal [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]] and a number of [[coffee shops]] that sell [[marijuana]], symbolising the Dutch political culture and tradition of tolerance.]]\nIn the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of [[pillarisation]], in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government. This tradition of tolerance influences Dutch [[criminal justice system of the Netherlands|criminal justice]] policies on [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|recreational drugs]], [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]], [[LGBT rights in the Netherlands|LGBT rights]], [[euthanasia]], and [[abortion in the Netherlands|abortion]], which are among the most liberal in the world.\n\n===Political parties===\n{{Main|Political parties of the Netherlands|Politics of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Ineke van Gent, Han ten Broeke en Kees Verhoeven, Lancering Europese Mobiliteitsweek 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The Netherlands has a culture of respectful and friendly debate.

Since suffrage became universal [[Pacification of 1917|in 1917]], the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democrats]], currently represented by the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA); second were the [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], represented by the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA); and third were the [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|Liberals]], of which the right-wing [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is the main representative.\n\nThese parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian Democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals. In the 1970s, the [[party system]] became more volatile: the Christian Democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical democrat]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) or the [[Ecology|ecologist]] party [[GroenLinks]] (GL).\n\nIn the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]], the CDA lost its dominant position. A \"[[Purple (government)|purple]]\" cabinet was formed by the VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 elections]], this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn|LPF]], a new political party, around [[Pim Fortuyn]], who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA Leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2003|2003 elections]], in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a [[Balkenende II|cabinet]] was formed by the CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the [[welfare state]], the [[Healthcare in the Netherlands|healthcare system]], and [[Border control#Immigration policy|immigration policy]].\n\nIn June 2006, the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the [[Ministry of Justice and Security (Netherlands)|Minister of Immigration and Integration]], [[Rita Verdonk]], who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a VVD [[Member of parliament|MP]]. A [[Third Balkenende cabinet|caretaker cabinet]] was formed by the CDA and VVD, and [[Dutch general election, 2006|general elections]] were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] made the largest gains. The [[2006\u201307 Dutch cabinet formation|formation of a new cabinet]] took three months, resulting in a [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-4|coalition]] of CDA, PvdA, and [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]].\n\nOn 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in [[Uruzgan]], Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kabinet valt over Uruzgan-besluit |newspaper=[[De Volkskrant]] |date=20 February 2010 |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223041947/http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archivedate=23 February 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |author1=Dirks, Bart |author2=Koel\u00e9, Theo |lastauthoramp=yes |language=Dutch |url-status=dead  }}</ref> [[Snap election]]s were held on [[Dutch general election, 2010|9 June 2010]], with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats.

relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of the Netherlands|List of diplomatic missions of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] (''Vredespaleis''), in [[The Hague]]]]\nThe history of [[foreign relations of the Netherlands|Dutch foreign policy]] has been characterised by its [[neutral state|neutrality]]. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, [[NATO]] and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on [[international trade]].\n\nThe [[foreign policy]] of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to [[atlanticism|Atlantic co-operation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]]. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|liberal policy towards soft drugs]].\n\nDuring and after the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]]. Indonesia became independent after the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s. Suriname became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. In addition, many people from these countries are living permanently in the Netherlands.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Armed forces of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Rob Bauer.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant admiral [[Rob Bauer]] is the current [[Chief of Defence (Netherlands)|Chief of Defence]].]]\nThe Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by [[Maurice of Nassau]] in the late 1500s. The Dutch army was used throughout the [[Dutch Empire]]. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a [[conscription]] army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands was invaded in World War II]] and defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.\n\n[[File:HNLMS Holland.jpg|thumb|''Zr. Ms. Holland'', a [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] [[offshore patrol vessel]]]]\nThe Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and became a founding member of [[NATO]] in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in [[Cold War]] Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Kosovo War]], it held a province in [[Iraq]] after the defeat of [[Saddam Hussein]], and it was engaged in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]].\n\nThe military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix ''Koninklijke'' (Royal):\n<!-- Pls do not change any of these from 'Royal Netherlands' to 'Dutch', the official name of ALL branches of the Army is Royal Netherlands-->\n* ''Koninklijke Marine'' (KM), the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps;\n* ''Koninklijke Landmacht'' (KL), the [[Royal Netherlands Army]];\n* ''Koninklijke Luchtmacht'' (KLu), the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]];\n* ''Koninklijke Marechaussee'' (KMar), the [[Royal Marechaussee]] (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control.\n\nThe submarine service is open to women as of 1 January 2017.

It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education. After completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream.\n\nThe [[Voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|VMBO]] has 4 grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the vmbo results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade, or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The [[Hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs|HAVO]] has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are [[Vocational university|universities of professional education]] (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. A HBO degree gives access to the university system. The [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]] (comprising [[Atheneum (school)|atheneum]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer of a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a four or five-year [[doctoral degree]] program.\n\nDoctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools that are publicly funded but not managed by the state even though requirements are necessary for the funding to be authorised. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the European Union. The amount is about 10,000 euros for non-EU students.\n\n===Healthcare===\n{{Main|Healthcare in the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723).

The Netherlands has been among the top three countries in each report published since 2005. On 48 indicators such as patient rights and information, accessibility, prevention and outcomes, the Netherlands secured its top position among 37 European countries for six years in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse|work=healthpowerhouse.com|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe Netherlands was ranked first in a study in 2009 comparing the [[health care system]]s of the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65M0SU20100623 | work=Reuters | title=U.S. scores dead last again in healthcare study | date=23 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110040524/http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 January 2012|title=Toward Higher-Performance Health Systems: Adults' Health Care Experiences In Seven Countries, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEver since a major reform of the health care system in 2006, the Dutch system received more points in the Index each year. According to the HCP ([[Health Consumer Powerhouse]]), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. The difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://healthpowerhouse.com/|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse \u2013 Health Care System's Indexes and reports}}</ref>\n\nHealth insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:\n* Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW), often called \"basic insurance\", covers common medical care.\n* Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care.\n\nWhile Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If a person decides not to carry out an insurance coverage, the person may be fined. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health \u2013 it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (''huisartsen'', comparable to [[general practitioner]]s) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.<ref name=\"Boot\">J.M.

Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the ''[[AWBZ|Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]]'' (\"General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs\") which first came into effect in 1968. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses.<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=71914ned&D1=37-43&D2=a&HDR=G1&STB=T&VW=T|title=Zorgrekeningen; uitgaven (in lopende en constante prijzen) en financiering|date=20 May 2010|publisher=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek: StatLine|language=Dutch|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor all regular (short-term) medical treatment, there is a system of obligatory [[health insurance]], with private health insurance companies. These insurance companies are obliged to provide a package with a defined set of insured treatments.<ref name=\"minvws.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.minvws.nl/en/themes/health-insurance-system/|title=Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport|first=Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en|last=Sport|work=minvws.nl|accessdate=26 August 2016|date=18 February 2010}}</ref> This insurance covers 41% of all health care expenses.<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\"/>\n\nOther sources of health care payment are taxes (14%), out of pocket payments (9%), additional optional health insurance packages (4%) and a range of other sources (4%).<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\"/> Affordability is guaranteed through a system of income-related allowances and individual and employer-paid income-related premiums.\n\nA key feature of the Dutch system is that premiums may not be related to health status or age. Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through [[Risk equalization|risk equalisation]] and a common [[risk pool]]. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about \u20ac100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and \u20ac150 or US$196 in 2012), with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and a yearly deductible of \u20ac220 (US$288).\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Hollande04.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Some symbols and icons of Dutch culture</div>]]\n\n===Art, philosophy and literature===\n{{Main|Dutch art|Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch literature}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=2/1/1|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Meisje met de parel.jpg|caption1=''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]\n| image2 = Vincent van Gogh - Self-portrait with grey felt hat - Google Art Project.jpg|caption2=Self-portrait by [[Vincent van Gogh]]\n| image3 = Rijksmuseum 2022.jpg|caption3=The [[Rijksmuseum]]\n| image4 = NEMO and area.jpg|caption4=The National [[NEMO (museum)|NEMO Science Museum]] and the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] in second plan, in Amsterdam\n}}\n\nThe Netherlands has had many well-known painters.

Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century were [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]]. [[M. C. Escher]] is a well-known graphics artist. [[Willem de Kooning]] was born and trained in [[Rotterdam]], although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist.\n\nThe Netherlands is the country of philosophers [[Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].

The Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) discovered [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], argued that light travelled as waves, invented the [[pendulum clock]] and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe and describe [[Microorganism|single-celled organisms]] with a [[microscope]].\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], literature flourished as well, with [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P. C. Hooft]] as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, [[Multatuli]] wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch colony, the current Indonesia. Important 20th century authors include [[Godfried Bomans]], [[Harry Mulisch]], [[Jan Wolkers]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Hella S. Haasse]], [[Cees Nooteboom]], [[Gerard Reve]] and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]. [[Anne Frank]]'s [[The Diary of a Young Girl|''Diary of a Young Girl'']] was published after she was murdered in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.\n\nThe traditional Dutch architecture is especially valued in [[Amsterdam]], [[Delft]] and [[Leiden]], with 17 and 18th century buildings along the canals. Smaller village architecture with wooden houses is found in [[Zaandam]] and [[Marken]]. Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in [[Huis Ten Bosch (theme park)|Huis Ten Bosch]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. A similar Holland Village is being built in [[Shenyang]], [[China]].

Some of the world's best known dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Ti\u00ebsto]], [[Hardwell]], [[Martin Garrix]], [[Dash Berlin]], [[Julian Jordan]], [[Nicky Romero]], [[W&W]], [[Don Diablo]] and [[Afrojack]]; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by [[DJ Mag Top 100 DJs]]. The [[Amsterdam Dance Event]] (ADE) is the world's leading electronic music conference and the biggest club festival for the many electronic subgenres on the planet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.local-life.com/amsterdam/articles/amsterdam-dance-event|title=Amsterdam Dance Event|work=local-life.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchdailynews.com/the-international-dance-industry-assembles-in-amsterdam-next-week/|title=The international Dance industry assembles in Amsterdam next week|work=Dutch Daily News|date=12 October 2012}}</ref> These DJs also contribute to the world's mainstream pop music, as they frequently collaborate and produce for high-profile international artists.\n\nThe Netherlands have [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|participated]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] since its first edition in 1956, and have won five times.

Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A [[NOC*NSF|Dutch National Olympic Committee]] was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 110 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. In international competition, Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands women's field hockey team]] is the most successful team in [[Women's Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] history. The [[Netherlands national baseball team|Netherlands baseball team]] have won the [[European Baseball Championship|European championship]] 20 times out of 32 events. Dutch [[K-1]] [[Kickboxing|kickboxers]] have won the [[K-1 World Grand Prix]] 15 times out of 19 tournaments.\n\nThe Dutch [[Speed skating|speed skaters']] performance at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], where they won 8 out of 12 events, 23 out of 36 medals, including 4 clean sweeps, is the most dominant performance in a single sport in Olympic history. Motorcycle racing at the [[TT Circuit Assen]] has a long history. Assen is the only venue to have held a round of the Motorcycle World Championship every year since its creation in 1949. The circuit was purpose-built for the Dutch TT in 1954, with previous events having been held on public roads.\n\nThe Dutch have also had success in all three of cyclings Grand Tours with [[Jan Janssen]] winning the [[1968 Tour de France]], more recently with [[Tom Dumoulin]] winning the [[2017 Giro d'Italia]] and legendary rider [[Joop Zoetemelk]] was the 1985 UCI World Champion, the winner of the [[1979 Vuelta a Espana]], the [[1980 Tour de France]] and still holds or shares numerous [[Tour de France]] records including most Tours finished and most kilometers ridden.\n\nLimburger [[Max Verstappen]] currently races in [[Formula One]], and [[2016 Spanish Grand Prix|was the first Dutchman to win a Grand Prix]].

Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables. The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]], with most [[global cuisine]]s being represented in the major cities.\n\nModern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. The regions in the northeast of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]], [[Drenthe]], [[Overijssel]] and [[Gelderland]] north of the [[Grote rivieren|great rivers]] are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of [[game (meat)|game]] and [[Animal husbandry|husbandry]], though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the [[IJsselmeer]] also include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the [[metworst]]-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Also smoked sausages are common, of which (''Gelderse'') ''[[rookworst]]'' is the most renowned. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside ''[[stamppot]]'', ''[[hutspot]]'' or ''zuurkool'' ([[sauerkraut]]); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a [[street food]]. The provinces are also home to hard textured [[rye bread]], pastries and cookies, the latter heavily spiced with [[ginger]] or [[succade]] or contain small bits of meat. Various kinds of ''Kruidkoek'' (such as [[:nl:Groninger koek|Groninger koek]]), ''[[:nl:Fryske d\u00famkes|Fryske d\u00famkes]]'' and ''[[:nl:spekdik|spekdikken]]'' (small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron) are considered typical. Notable characteristics of ''Fries roggebrood'' (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warenkennis.nl/graan/soorten.htm|title=Graansoorten|website=Warenkennis.nl|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many [[bitters]] (such as ''[[Beerenburg]]'') and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from ''[[Jenever]]'', typical for the rest of the country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. ''Friese Nagelkaas'' ([[Friesian Clove]]) is a notable example.\n\nThe provinces of [[North Holland]], [[South Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and the Gelderlandic area of [[Betuwe]] make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the abundance of water and flat grasslands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]], [[Leyden cheese|Leyden]] (spiced cheese with cumin), and [[Edam (cheese)|Edam]] (traditionally in small spheres) as well as [[Leerdammer]] and [[Beemster Cheese|Beemster]], while the adjacent [[Zaanstreek]] in [[North Holland]] has since the 16th century beem known for its [[mayonnaise]], typical whole-grain [[mustard (condiment)|mustards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smulweb.nl/blog/tonia/718/de-geschiedenis-van-de-mosterd|title=De geschiedenis van de mosterd - Smulweb Blog|date=5 May 2000}}</ref> and [[chocolate]] industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of [[milkfat]] than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, ''karnemelk'' ([[buttermilk]]), is also considered typical for this region. [[Seafood]] such as [[soused herring]], [[Blue mussel|mussels]] (called ''Zeeuwse Mossels'', since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's [[Oosterschelde]]), [[European eel|eels]], [[oyster]]s and [[shrimp]]s are widely available and typical for the region. ''[[:nl:Kibbeling|Kibbeling]]'', once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], has become a national [[fast food]], just as [[:nl:Lekkerbekje|lekkerbek]]. Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The ''[[oliebol]]'' (in its modern form) and ''[[Zeeuwse bolus]]'' are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like ''[[stroopwafel]]'', as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like ''[[:nl:Gevulde koek|gevulde koek]]''. The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are [[beer]] (strong pale lager) and ''[[Jenever]]'', a high proof [[juniper]]-flavored spirit, that came to be known in England as [[gin]]. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, ''[[Advocaat]]'', a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.\n\nThe Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and the [[Flemish Region]] in [[Belgium]]. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an [[haute cuisine]]. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the ''[[Vlaai]]'' from Limburg and the ''Moorkop'' and ''[[Bossche Bol]]'' from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the {{lang|nl|worstenbroodje}} (a roll with a sausage of [[ground beef]], literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from ''[[Trappist beer|Trappist]]'' to ''[[Kriek lambic|Kriek]]''. 5 of the 10 ''International Trappist Association'' recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews.\n\nIn early 2014, [[Oxfam]] ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=14 January 2014 |title=Netherlands is country with most plentiful, healthy food: Oxfam |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/15/us-food-countries-idUSBREA0E01S20140115 |newspaper= |location=New York |publisher=Reuters U.S. |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Good Enough to Eat \u2013 Media Briefing|url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Good_Enough_To_Eat_Media_brief_FINAL.pdf |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Oxfam]] America |agency= |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial heritage===\n{{Main|Dutch Empire}}\n{{further|Dutch East Indies|Indos in the Dutch East Indies}}\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[New Amsterdam]] as it appeared in 1664.

The species is [[diurnality|diurnal]] and is a feeding generalist, preying on a number of different species and carrion. Predators of this species include [[birds of prey]], [[honey badger]]s and various species of [[mongoose]]. The Cape cobra is also known as the '''\"geelslang\"''' (yellow snake) and '''\"bruinkapel\"''' (brown cobra) in South Africa. [[Afrikaans]] speaking South Africans also refer to the Cape cobra as '''\"koperkapel\"''' (\"copper cobra\"), mainly because of a rich yellow colour variation. This species has no known subspecies.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Naja nivea'' was first described by Swedish zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758.<ref name=\"itis2\"/> The [[genus|generic]] name ''naja'' is a Latinisation of the [[Sanskrit]] word '''{{IAST|n\u0101g\u00e1}}''' ({{lang|sa|[[:wikt:\u0928\u093e\u0917#Sanskrit|\u0928\u093e\u0917]]}}) meaning \"cobra\".  The [[species|specific]] epithet ''nivea'' is derived from the [[Latin]] words either ''nix'' or ''nivis'' meaning \"snow\" or ''niveus'' meaning \"snowy\" <ref name=nivea>{{cite web|title=Etymology of ''Nivis''|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=nivis&searchmode=none|work=Etymology|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref> or \"snow-white\". The connection with snow is obscure, but might have been suggested by discolouration of the first preserved specimens received by taxonomists in Europe.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''[[Naja]]'' is a genus in the family [[Elapidae]]. [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] first described ''[[Naja nivea]]'' in 1758.<ref name=\"itis2\"/> He originally assigned the binomial name ''Coluber niveus'', but some ten years afterwards [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]] described the genus of true cobras under the name ''Naja''. In 2007 W\u00fcster ''et al.'' partitioned the genus ''Naja'' into four separate subgenera on the basis of various factors such as lineage, morphology and diet. They placed ''Naja nivea'' in the subgenus ''Uraeus'', the African non-spitting cobras: the Cape cobra (''N. nivea''), the [[Egyptian cobra]] (''N. haje''), the [[snouted cobra]] (''N. annulifera''), [[Anchieta's cobra]] (''N. anchietae''), [[Arabian cobra]] (''N. arabica'') and [[Senegalese cobra]] (''N. senegalensis'').<ref name=\"Zootaxa\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2009/f/zt02236p036.pdf | accessdate=2 March 2014 | author2=W\u00fcster, W.; Broadley DG. | first1=V. | last1=Wallach | title=In praise of subgenera: taxonomic status of cobras of the genus Naja Laurenti (Serpentes: Elapidae) | journal=Zootaxa | year=2009 | volume=2236 | pages=26\u201336}}</ref>\n\n{{clade| style=font-size:90%; line-height:90%\n|label1=''[[Naja]]''\n|1={{clade\n   |label1=''([[Naja (subgenus)|Naja]])''\n   |1={{clade\n      |1=''[[Naja naja|Naja (Naja) naja]]''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=''[[Naja kaouthia|Naja (Naja) kaouthia]]''\n            |2=''[[Naja atra|Naja (Naja) atra]]'' }}\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Naja mandalayensis|Naja (Naja) mandalayensis]]''\n            |2=''[[Naja siamensis|Naja (Naja) siamensis]]''\n            |3=''[[Naja sputatrix|Naja (Naja) sputatrix]]'' }} }} }}\n   |2={{clade\n      |label1=''([[Afronaja]])''\n      |1={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=''[[Naja pallida|Naja (Afronaja) pallida]]''\n            |2=''[[Naja nubiae|Naja (Afronaja) nubiae]]'' }}\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Naja katiensis|Naja (Afronaja) katiensis]]''\n            |2={{clade\n               |1=''[[Naja nigricollis|Naja (Afronaja) nigricollis]]''\n               |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Naja ashei|Naja (Afronaja) ashei]]''\n                  |2={{clade\n                     |1=''[[Naja mossambica|Naja (Afronaja) mossambica]]''\n                     |2=''[[Naja nigricincta|Naja (Afronaja) nigricincta]]'' }} }} }} }} }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |label1=''([[Boulengerina]])''\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=''[[Naja multifasciata|Naja (Boulengerina) multifasciata]]'' | status1=dashed\n            |2={{clade\n               |1={{clade | status1=dashed\n                  |1=''[[Naja christyi|Naja (Boulengerina) christyi]]''\n                  |2=''[[Naja annulata|Naja (Boulengerina) annulata]]'' }}\n               |2=''[[Naja melanoleuca|Naja (Boulengerina) melanoleuca]]'' }} }}\n         |label2=''([[Uraeus]])''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1='''''Naja (Uraeus) nivea'''''\n            |2={{clade\n               |1=''[[Naja senegalensis|Naja (Uraeus) senegalensis]]''\n               |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Naja haje|Naja (Uraeus) haje]]''\n                  |2=''[[Naja arabica|Naja (Uraeus) arabica]]'' }}\n               |3={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Naja annulifera|Naja (Uraeus) annulifera]]''\n                  |2=''[[Naja anchietae|Naja (Uraeus) anchietae]]'' }} }} }} }} }} }} }}\n\n===Description===\n[[File:Naja nivea in a dark brown and yellow speckled pattern IMG 0846.JPG|thumb|left|250px]]\nThe Cape cobra is a medium-sized species of cobra.

In addition, individuals show a varying degree of black or pale stippling and blotches, and although colour and marking are geographically related, it is also possible to observe virtually all colour varieties at one location. For example, the [[Kalahari Desert]] specimens in [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]] are usually more consistently yellow than the more southerly populations.<ref name=Spawls/> However, at [[De Hoop Nature Reserve|De Hoop]], and other specific locations in the Western Cape, all colour variations have been recorded.<ref name=phelps/> Juvenile specimens generally have conspicuously dark throats extending down the belly for the width of a dozen or so ventral [[Snake scales|scales]]. The colour fades during the first year or two of life, but while it lasts it commonly leads laymen to confuse the juvenile Cape cobra with the [[Rinkhals]] spitting cobra.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Scalation<ref name=Marais/>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Dorsal at midbody\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Ventral\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Subcaudal\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Anal plate\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Upper labials\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Upper labials to eye\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Preoculars\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Postoculars\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Lower labials\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Temporal\n|-\n| 21 || 195-227 || 50-68 (paired) || Single || 7 || 3+4 || 1 || 3 (can be 4) || 9 (8-10) || 1+2 (variable)\n|}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe Cape cobra is endemic to [[southern Africa]]. In [[South Africa]], where it most often occurs, the species occurs throughout the [[Western Cape]], [[Northern Cape]], [[Eastern Cape]], [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], and [[North West Province (South Africa)|North West Province]]. It also is found in the southern half of [[Namibia]], southwestern [[Botswana]], and western [[Lesotho]].<ref name=phelps/><ref name=Spawls/>\n\n[[File:Naja nivea IMG 5078 Kappkobra.jpg|thumb|left|''Naja nivea''. Mature Cape cobras. Speckled colour variants, In repose without spread hoods.]]\nAlthough the Cape cobra has a smaller geographical range than any other African cobra, it occurs in a variety of different habitats. The preferred habitat of the species is [[fynbos]], [[bushveld]], [[Karoo|karoo scrubland]], [[Savanna|arid savanna]], the [[Namib desert]] and the [[Kalahari Desert|Kalahari desert]]. It often inhabits rodent burrows, abandoned termite mounds and, in arid regions, rock crevices. Where it occurs in temperate regions and arid karroid regions, it is often found along rivers and streams entering well-drained, open areas.\n\nIn [[Lesotho]], they may occur at altitudes as high as {{convert|2500|m|ft}} above sea level. They occur in forest and high grassland areas of [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] province, in rocky hills of the [[Cape Province|Cape]] and in desert and semi-desert areas throughout their geographical range. Cape cobras venture into villages, partially developed suburbs, and squatter communities where they may enter houses to escape the heat of the day or to seek prey such as rodents. This brings them into direct contact with humans.<ref name=Marais/><ref name=Spawls>{{cite book|last=Spawls|last2 =Branch|first=Stephen|first2= Bill|title=Dangerous Snakes of Africa|year=1995|publisher=Blandford Press|location=London, UK|isbn=0-7137-2394-7|pages=81\u201382}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nThe Cape cobra is a [[Diurnality|diurnal]] species and actively forages throughout the day. During very hot weather it may become [[crepuscular]], but is rarely if ever observed during the hours of darkness.<ref name=phelps/> It is a terrestrial snake, but will readily climb trees and bushes, and shows considerable agility in for example systematically robbing the nests of the [[sociable weaver]]. When not active, it hides in holes or under ground cover, such as brush piles, often remaining in the same retreat for some time.

The species is [[diurnality|diurnal]] and is a feeding generalist, preying on a number of different species and carrion. Predators of this species include [[birds of prey]], [[honey badger]]s and various species of [[mongoose]]. The Cape cobra is also known as the '''\"geelslang\"''' (yellow snake) and '''\"bruinkapel\"''' (brown cobra) in South Africa. [[Afrikaans]] speaking South Africans also refer to the Cape cobra as '''\"koperkapel\"''' (\"copper cobra\"), mainly because of a rich yellow colour variation. This species has no known subspecies.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Naja nivea'' was first described by Swedish zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758.<ref name=\"itis2\"/> The [[genus|generic]] name ''naja'' is a Latinisation of the [[Sanskrit]] word '''{{IAST|n\u0101g\u00e1}}''' ({{lang|sa|[[:wikt:\u0928\u093e\u0917#Sanskrit|\u0928\u093e\u0917]]}}) meaning \"cobra\".  The [[species|specific]] epithet ''nivea'' is derived from the [[Latin]] words either ''nix'' or ''nivis'' meaning \"snow\" or ''niveus'' meaning \"snowy\" <ref name=nivea>{{cite web|title=Etymology of ''Nivis''|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=nivis&searchmode=none|work=Etymology|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref> or \"snow-white\". The connection with snow is obscure, but might have been suggested by discolouration of the first preserved specimens received by taxonomists in Europe.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''[[Naja]]'' is a genus in the family [[Elapidae]]. [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] first described ''[[Naja nivea]]'' in 1758.<ref name=\"itis2\"/> He originally assigned the binomial name ''Coluber niveus'', but some ten years afterwards [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]] described the genus of true cobras under the name ''Naja''. In 2007 W\u00fcster ''et al.'' partitioned the genus ''Naja'' into four separate subgenera on the basis of various factors such as lineage, morphology and diet. They placed ''Naja nivea'' in the subgenus ''Uraeus'', the African non-spitting cobras: the Cape cobra (''N. nivea''), the [[Egyptian cobra]] (''N. haje''), the [[snouted cobra]] (''N. annulifera''), [[Anchieta's cobra]] (''N. anchietae''), [[Arabian cobra]] (''N. arabica'') and [[Senegalese cobra]] (''N. senegalensis'').<ref name=\"Zootaxa\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2009/f/zt02236p036.pdf | accessdate=2 March 2014 | author2=W\u00fcster, W.; Broadley DG. | first1=V. | last1=Wallach | title=In praise of subgenera: taxonomic status of cobras of the genus Naja Laurenti (Serpentes: Elapidae) | journal=Zootaxa | year=2009 | volume=2236 | pages=26\u201336}}</ref>\n\n{{clade| style=font-size:90%; line-height:90%\n|label1=''[[Naja]]''\n|1={{clade\n   |label1=''([[Naja (subgenus)|Naja]])''\n   |1={{clade\n      |1=''[[Naja naja|Naja (Naja) naja]]''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=''[[Naja kaouthia|Naja (Naja) kaouthia]]''\n            |2=''[[Naja atra|Naja (Naja) atra]]'' }}\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Naja mandalayensis|Naja (Naja) mandalayensis]]''\n            |2=''[[Naja siamensis|Naja (Naja) siamensis]]''\n            |3=''[[Naja sputatrix|Naja (Naja) sputatrix]]'' }} }} }}\n   |2={{clade\n      |label1=''([[Afronaja]])''\n      |1={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=''[[Naja pallida|Naja (Afronaja) pallida]]''\n            |2=''[[Naja nubiae|Naja (Afronaja) nubiae]]'' }}\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Naja katiensis|Naja (Afronaja) katiensis]]''\n            |2={{clade\n               |1=''[[Naja nigricollis|Naja (Afronaja) nigricollis]]''\n               |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Naja ashei|Naja (Afronaja) ashei]]''\n                  |2={{clade\n                     |1=''[[Naja mossambica|Naja (Afronaja) mossambica]]''\n                     |2=''[[Naja nigricincta|Naja (Afronaja) nigricincta]]'' }} }} }} }} }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |label1=''([[Boulengerina]])''\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=''[[Naja multifasciata|Naja (Boulengerina) multifasciata]]'' | status1=dashed\n            |2={{clade\n               |1={{clade | status1=dashed\n                  |1=''[[Naja christyi|Naja (Boulengerina) christyi]]''\n                  |2=''[[Naja annulata|Naja (Boulengerina) annulata]]'' }}\n               |2=''[[Naja melanoleuca|Naja (Boulengerina) melanoleuca]]'' }} }}\n         |label2=''([[Uraeus]])''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1='''''Naja (Uraeus) nivea'''''\n            |2={{clade\n               |1=''[[Naja senegalensis|Naja (Uraeus) senegalensis]]''\n               |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Naja haje|Naja (Uraeus) haje]]''\n                  |2=''[[Naja arabica|Naja (Uraeus) arabica]]'' }}\n               |3={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Naja annulifera|Naja (Uraeus) annulifera]]''\n                  |2=''[[Naja anchietae|Naja (Uraeus) anchietae]]'' }} }} }} }} }} }} }}\n\n===Description===\n[[File:Naja nivea in a dark brown and yellow speckled pattern IMG 0846.JPG|thumb|left|250px]]\nThe Cape cobra is a medium-sized species of cobra.

In addition, individuals show a varying degree of black or pale stippling and blotches, and although colour and marking are geographically related, it is also possible to observe virtually all colour varieties at one location. For example, the [[Kalahari Desert]] specimens in [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]] are usually more consistently yellow than the more southerly populations.<ref name=Spawls/> However, at [[De Hoop Nature Reserve|De Hoop]], and other specific locations in the Western Cape, all colour variations have been recorded.<ref name=phelps/> Juvenile specimens generally have conspicuously dark throats extending down the belly for the width of a dozen or so ventral [[Snake scales|scales]].

The preferred habitat of the species is [[fynbos]], [[bushveld]], [[Karoo|karoo scrubland]], [[Savanna|arid savanna]], the [[Namib desert]] and the [[Kalahari Desert|Kalahari desert]]. It often inhabits rodent burrows, abandoned termite mounds and, in arid regions, rock crevices.

The mortality rate for untreated bites is not exactly known, but is thought to be high. This can be due to various factors including the amount of venom injected, psychological state of the bitten subject, the penetration of one or both fangs, and so on. Mechanical ventilation and symptom management is often enough to save a victim's life, but cases of serious Cape cobra envenomation will require antivenom. When death does occur, it normally takes anywhere from an hour (in severe cases) to ten hours (or more) and it is often as a result of respiratory failure, due to the onset of paralysis.<ref name=WCH/> The antivenom used in case of a bite is a polyvalent antivenom produced by the South African Institute of Medical Research (SAIMR).<ref name=davidson>{{cite web|last=Davidson |first=Terence |title=IMMEDIATE FIRST AID For bites by Cape Cobra (''Naja nivea'') |url=http://drdavidson.ucsd.edu/Portals/0/snake/Naja3.htm |work=Snakebite Protocol |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=27 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402114841/http://drdavidson.ucsd.edu/Portals/0/snake/Naja3.htm |archivedate=2 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Naja nivea}}\n* [http://www.reptilechannel.com/reptile-species/snakes-profiles/cape-cobra-2.aspx Reptile Channel - Cape cobra]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120402114841/http://drdavidson.ucsd.edu/Portals/0/snake/Naja3.htm Immediate First Aid (Cape cobra)]\n* [http://www.factzoo.com/reptiles/snakes/cape-cobra-yellow-deadly-southern-africa.html Fact Zoo - Cape cobra]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150818080049/http://www.capesnakeconservation.com/western-cape-snakes/venomous/cape-cobra/ Cape Snake Conservation - Cape Cobra]\n\n{{Naja species}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1130416}}\n\n[[Category:Naja]]\n[[Category:Snakes of Africa]]\n[[Category:Reptiles of Southern Africa]]\n[[Category:Reptiles described in 1758]]\n", "name_user": "Pincotti4", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_cobra"}

The competition has been staged every two years since the first tournament in [[1977 FIFA World Youth Championship|1977]] held in [[Tunisia]].<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/fifau20/history/index.html CBC.ca]</ref> Until 2005 it was known as the '''FIFA World Youth Championship'''. The current champion is [[Ukraine national under-20 football team|Ukraine]], which won its first title at the [[2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2019 tournament]] in Poland.\n\n== History ==\nIn the twenty-two tournaments held, eleven different nations have won the title. [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina]] is the most successful team with six titles, followed by [[Brazil national under-20 football team|Brazil]] with five titles. [[Portugal national under-20 football team|Portugal]] and [[Serbia national under-20 football team|Serbia]] have both won two titles (with the latter winning once as [[Yugoslavia national under-20 football team|Yugoslavia]]), while [[Ghana national under-20 football team|Ghana]], [[Germany national youth football team|Germany]], [[Spain national under-20 football team|Spain]], [[France national under-20 football team|France]], [[England national under-20 football team|England]], [[Ukraine national under-20 football team|Ukraine]] and [[Russia national under-20 football team|Russia]] (as the [[Soviet Union national under-20 football team|USSR]] with Ukrainian players Bessonov, Bal) have won the title once each.\n\nA corresponding event for women's teams, the [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], began in 2002 with the name \"FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship\" and an age limit of 19. The age limit for the women's competition was changed to 20 beginning with the [[2006 FIFA U-20 Women's World Championship]], and the competition was renamed as a \"World Cup\" in 2007 in preparation for the [[2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup|2008 event]]. The next edition will be held in [[2021 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2021]] in [[Indonesia]].\n\n==Qualification==\n24 teams appear in the final tournament. 23 countries, including the defending champions, have to qualify in the youth championships of the six confederations.

age of 20, organised by [[FIFA]]. The competition has been staged every two years since the first tournament in [[1977 FIFA World Youth Championship|1977]] held in [[Tunisia]].<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/fifau20/history/index.html CBC.ca]</ref> Until 2005 it was known as the '''FIFA World Youth Championship'''. The current champion is [[Ukraine national under-20 football team|Ukraine]], which won its first title at the [[2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2019 tournament]] in Poland.\n\n== History ==\nIn the twenty-two tournaments held, eleven different nations have won the title. [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina]] is the most successful team with six titles, followed by [[Brazil national under-20 football team|Brazil]] with five titles. [[Portugal national under-20 football team|Portugal]] and [[Serbia national under-20 football team|Serbia]] have both won two titles (with the latter winning once as [[Yugoslavia national under-20 football team|Yugoslavia]]), while [[Ghana national under-20 football team|Ghana]], [[Germany national youth football team|Germany]], [[Spain national under-20 football team|Spain]], [[France national under-20 football team|France]], [[England national under-20 football team|England]], [[Ukraine national under-20 football team|Ukraine]] and [[Russia national under-20 football team|Russia]] (as the [[Soviet Union national under-20 football team|USSR]] with Ukrainian players Bessonov, Bal) have won the title once each.\n\nA corresponding event for women's teams, the [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], began in 2002 with the name \"FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship\" and an age limit of 19. The age limit for the women's competition was changed to 20 beginning with the [[2006 FIFA U-20 Women's World Championship]], and the competition was renamed as a \"World Cup\" in 2007 in preparation for the [[2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup|2008 event]]. The next edition will be held in [[2021 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2021]] in [[Indonesia]].\n\n==Qualification==\n24 teams appear in the final tournament. 23 countries, including the defending champions, have to qualify in the youth championships of the six confederations.  The host country automatically qualifies.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Confederation\n!Championship\n|-\n|[[Asian Football Confederation|AFC (Asia)]]\n|[[AFC U-19 Championship]]\n|-\n|[[Confederation of African Football|CAF (Africa)]]\n|[[Africa U-20 Cup of Nations|African Youth Championship]]\n|-\n|[[CONCACAF|CONCACAF (North, Central America and Caribbean)]]\n|[[CONCACAF Under-20 Championship]]\n|-\n|[[CONMEBOL|CONMEBOL (South America)]]\n|[[South American Youth Football Championship]]\n|-\n|[[UEFA|UEFA (Europe)]]\n|[[UEFA European Under-19 Championship|UEFA European U-19 Championship]]\n|-\n|[[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC (Oceania)]]\n|[[OFC U-19 Championship|OFC Under 20 Qualifying Tournament]]\n|}\n\n==Results==\n\n===Summaries===\n\n====FIFA World Youth Championship====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=#C1D8FF\n!rowspan=2 width=2%|Edition\n!rowspan=2 width=5%|Year\n!rowspan=2 width=8%|Hosts\n!width=1% rowspan=17|\n!colspan=3|Final\n!width=1% rowspan=17|\n!colspan=3|Third place match\n!width=1% rowspan=17|\n!rowspan=2 width=7%|Number of teams\n|- bgcolor=#EFEFEF\n!

The production and quality of Australian wine was much improved by the arrival of free settlers from various parts of Europe, who used their skills and knowledge to establish some of Australia's premier wine regions. For example, emigrants from [[Prussia]] in the mid-1850s were important in establishing [[South Australia (wine)|South Australia's]] [[Barossa Valley (wine)|Barossa Valley]] as a winemaking region. In smaller scale, winemakers from [[Switzerland]] also helped in establishing Geelong wine region in Victoria in 1842.\n\nEarly Australian winemakers faced many difficulties, particularly due to the unfamiliar Australian climate. But because it is also warm, dry, and Mediterranean overall, making Australia ideal for wine production, they eventually achieved considerable success. \"At the 1873 Vienna Exhibition the French judges, tasting blind, praised some wines from Victoria, but withdrew in protest when the [[provenance]] of the wine was revealed, on the grounds that wines of that quality must clearly be French.\"<ref name=\"shw\">{{cite book |last= Phillips| first= Roderick |title=A short history of wine |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |year=2000 |page=265 |isbn=0-7139-9432-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Australian wines continued to win high honours in French competitions. A Victorian [[Syrah]] (also called Shiraz) competing in the 1878 Paris Exhibition was likened to [[Ch\u00e2teau Margaux]] and \"its taste completed its trinity of perfection.\"<ref name=\"shw\"/> One Australian wine won a gold medal \"first class\" at the 1882 Bordeaux International Exhibition and another won a gold medal \"against the world\" at the 1889 Paris International Exhibition.<ref name=\"shw\"/> That was all before the destructive effects on the industry of the [[phylloxera]] epidemic.\n\nAustralia has rapidly become a world leader in both the quantity and quality of wines it produces. For example, Australian wine exports to the US rose from 578,000 cases in 1990 to 20,000,000 cases in 2004 and in 2000 it exported more wine than France to the UK for the first time in history.\n\nThe industry has at times suffered from its own productivity. In the late 1980s, governments sponsored growers to pull out their vines to overcome a glut of winegrapes. Low grape prices in 2005 and 2006 have led to calls for another sponsored vine pull.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |work=PM |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1655724.htm |title=Grape glut: call for subsidised vine pull |date=5 June 2006 |accessdate=27 August 2006 |first= Nance |last= Haxton}}</ref> [[Cleanskin (wine)|Cleanskin]] wines were introduced into Australia during the 1960s as a means to combat oversupply and poor sales.\n\nIn recent years organic and [[Biodynamic wine|biodynamic]] wines have been increasing in popularity, following a worldwide trend. In 2004 Australia hosted the First International Biodynamic Wine Forum in Beechworth, Victoria which brought together biodynamic wine producers from around the globe. Despite the [[overproduction]] of grapes many organic and biodynamic growers have enjoyed continuing demand thanks to the premium prices winemakers can charge for their organic and biodynamic products, particularly in the European market.\n\n==Grape varieties==\nMajor [[list of grape varieties|grape varieties]] are [[Shiraz grape|Shiraz]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]],<ref name=walt>{{cite book| last =Walton| first =Stuart| title =Cook's Encyclopedia of Wine| year =2005| publisher =Anness Publishing Limited 2002, 2005| pages =s.232, 233| isbn =0-7607-4220-0| url =https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780760742204}}</ref> [[Merlot]], [[Chardonnay]],<ref name=walt/> [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Riesling]]. The country has no native grapes, and ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' varieties were introduced from Europe and South Africa in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Some varieties have been bred by Australian viticulturists, for example [[Cienna]] and [[Tarrango]].\n\nAlthough Syrah was originally called Shiraz in Australia and Syrah elsewhere, its dramatic commercial success has led many Syrah producers around the world to label their wine \"Shiraz\".\n\nAbout 130 different grape varieties are used by commercial winemakers in Australia.  Over recent years many winemakers have begun exploring so-called \"alternative varieties\" other than those listed above.  Many varieties from France, Italy and Spain for example [[Petit Verdot]], [[Pinot grigio]], [[Pinot noir]], [[Sangiovese]], [[Tempranillo]] and [[Viognier]] are becoming more common. Wines from many other varieties are being produced.\n\nAustralian winemaking results have been impressive and it has established benchmarks for a number of varietals, such as Chardonnay and Shiraz. Moreover, Australians have innovated in [[canopy (grape)|canopy]] management and other viticultural and in wine-making techniques, and they have a general attitude toward their work that sets them apart from producers in Europe. Australian wine-makers travel the wine world as highly skilled seasonal workers, relocating to the northern hemisphere during the off-season at home. They are an important resource in the globalisation of wine and wine critic [[Matt Kramer (wine)|Matt Kramer]] notes that \"the most powerful influence in wine today\" comes from Australia.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(See [[List of Australian wine grape varieties]])</div>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Red grapes planted\n!

The production and quality of Australian wine was much improved by the arrival of free settlers from various parts of Europe, who used their skills and knowledge to establish some of Australia's premier wine regions. For example, emigrants from [[Prussia]] in the mid-1850s were important in establishing [[South Australia (wine)|South Australia's]] [[Barossa Valley (wine)|Barossa Valley]] as a winemaking region. In smaller scale, winemakers from [[Switzerland]] also helped in establishing Geelong wine region in Victoria in 1842.\n\nEarly Australian winemakers faced many difficulties, particularly due to the unfamiliar Australian climate. But because it is also warm, dry, and Mediterranean overall, making Australia ideal for wine production, they eventually achieved considerable success. \"At the 1873 Vienna Exhibition the French judges, tasting blind, praised some wines from Victoria, but withdrew in protest when the [[provenance]] of the wine was revealed, on the grounds that wines of that quality must clearly be French.\"<ref name=\"shw\">{{cite book |last= Phillips| first= Roderick |title=A short history of wine |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |year=2000 |page=265 |isbn=0-7139-9432-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Australian wines continued to win high honours in French competitions. A Victorian [[Syrah]] (also called Shiraz) competing in the 1878 Paris Exhibition was likened to [[Ch\u00e2teau Margaux]] and \"its taste completed its trinity of perfection.\"<ref name=\"shw\"/> One Australian wine won a gold medal \"first class\" at the 1882 Bordeaux International Exhibition and another won a gold medal \"against the world\" at the 1889 Paris International Exhibition.<ref name=\"shw\"/> That was all before the destructive effects on the industry of the [[phylloxera]] epidemic.\n\nAustralia has rapidly become a world leader in both the quantity and quality of wines it produces. For example, Australian wine exports to the US rose from 578,000 cases in 1990 to 20,000,000 cases in 2004 and in 2000 it exported more wine than France to the UK for the first time in history.\n\nThe industry has at times suffered from its own productivity. In the late 1980s, governments sponsored growers to pull out their vines to overcome a glut of winegrapes. Low grape prices in 2005 and 2006 have led to calls for another sponsored vine pull.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |work=PM |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1655724.htm |title=Grape glut: call for subsidised vine pull |date=5 June 2006 |accessdate=27 August 2006 |first= Nance |last= Haxton}}</ref> [[Cleanskin (wine)|Cleanskin]] wines were introduced into Australia during the 1960s as a means to combat oversupply and poor sales.\n\nIn recent years organic and [[Biodynamic wine|biodynamic]] wines have been increasing in popularity, following a worldwide trend. In 2004 Australia hosted the First International Biodynamic Wine Forum in Beechworth, Victoria which brought together biodynamic wine producers from around the globe. Despite the [[overproduction]] of grapes many organic and biodynamic growers have enjoyed continuing demand thanks to the premium prices winemakers can charge for their organic and biodynamic products, particularly in the European market.\n\n==Grape varieties==\nMajor [[list of grape varieties|grape varieties]] are [[Shiraz grape|Shiraz]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]],<ref name=walt>{{cite book| last =Walton| first =Stuart| title =Cook's Encyclopedia of Wine| year =2005| publisher =Anness Publishing Limited 2002, 2005| pages =s.232, 233| isbn =0-7607-4220-0| url =https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780760742204}}</ref> [[Merlot]], [[Chardonnay]],<ref name=walt/> [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Riesling]]. The country has no native grapes, and ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' varieties were introduced from Europe and South Africa in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Some varieties have been bred by Australian viticulturists, for example [[Cienna]] and [[Tarrango]].\n\nAlthough Syrah was originally called Shiraz in Australia and Syrah elsewhere, its dramatic commercial success has led many Syrah producers around the world to label their wine \"Shiraz\".\n\nAbout 130 different grape varieties are used by commercial winemakers in Australia.  Over recent years many winemakers have begun exploring so-called \"alternative varieties\" other than those listed above.  Many varieties from France, Italy and Spain for example [[Petit Verdot]], [[Pinot grigio]], [[Pinot noir]], [[Sangiovese]], [[Tempranillo]] and [[Viognier]] are becoming more common. Wines from many other varieties are being produced.\n\nAustralian winemaking results have been impressive and it has established benchmarks for a number of varietals, such as Chardonnay and Shiraz. Moreover, Australians have innovated in [[canopy (grape)|canopy]] management and other viticultural and in wine-making techniques, and they have a general attitude toward their work that sets them apart from producers in Europe. Australian wine-makers travel the wine world as highly skilled seasonal workers, relocating to the northern hemisphere during the off-season at home. They are an important resource in the globalisation of wine and wine critic [[Matt Kramer (wine)|Matt Kramer]] notes that \"the most powerful influence in wine today\" comes from Australia.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(See [[List of Australian wine grape varieties]])</div>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Red grapes planted\n!

As a blending component, it contributes alcohol, warmth and fruitiness without added [[grape tannins|tannin]]s. Shiraz can contribute full-bodied, fleshy flavours of black fruits and pepper. It adds color, backbone and tannins and provides the sense of balance such blends require.

[[BoxRec]]. Retrieved 2015-06-07.</ref>\n\n==Boxing==\nIn [[professional boxing]], super middleweight is contested between the [[middleweight]] and [[light heavyweight]] divisions, in which boxers can weigh between 160 pounds (73 kg) and {{convert|168|lb|kg}}. The class first appeared in 1967.\n\n[[Joe Calzaghe]] and [[Sven Ottke]] jointly hold the record for most consecutive title defenses in this division, with 21 defenses of the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] titles respectively.\n\n===History===\n====1960s&ndash;1983====\nThere was interest in a division between middleweight and light heavyweight in the late 1960s, the mid-1970s, and the early 1980s. A few states briefly recognized a \"Junior Light Heavyweight\" division at {{convert|167|lb|kg}} and the fringe World Athletic Association (WAA) later inaugurated a \"super middleweight\" division at {{convert|168|lb|kg}}. On April 3, 1967, in Salt Lake City, Utah, [[Don Fullmer]], a brother of former world middleweight champion [[Gene Fullmer]], won the first version by stopping previously unbeaten Joe Hopkins in six rounds. He never defended it. On November 25, 1974, in Columbus, Ohio, Billy Douglas, the father of future world heavyweight champion [[James \"Buster\" Douglas]], halted Danny Brewer in two rounds to win the Ohio Commission's version of the world junior light heavyweight title. He too never made a defense of the title. Then, on April 3, 1982, in Denver, Colorado, Jerry \"Wimpy\" Halstead stopped Ron Brown in six rounds to win the WAA's inaugural super middleweight title bout. Halstead made one defense, knocking out Darren Encline in one round on May 29, 1982, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Following that fight, Halstead moved up to the light heavyweight class and eventually campaigned as a heavyweight. The media and most commissions did not recognize Fullmer's, Douglas', or Halstead's titles. Nor did they recognize the division during this period.<ref>{{cite book | last = Mullan | first = Harry | title = The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Boxing | publisher = Carlton Books | year = 1996 | location = London, England | isbn = 0-7858-0641-5 | page = 150}}</ref>\n\n====1984&ndash;1989====\nThe current super middleweight division traces its beginning to 1984, when [[Murray Sutherland]] defeated Ernie Singletary for the [[International Boxing Federation]] version of the title. The [[World Boxing Association]] created its version of the super middleweight title when reigning [[Lineal championship|''Lineal'']] champion [[Chong Pal Park]] defeated Jesus Gallardo in 1987 (Park had been IBF champion before relinquishing the title to fight for the inaugural WBA version).  The [[World Boxing Council]] crowned its first champion in 1988 when [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] defeated [[Donny Lalonde]] in a fight that was also for its version of the light heavyweight title.\n\n====1990&ndash;2007====\nSince the early 1990s, there has been a highly competitive super middleweight division in Britain and Ireland, including the rivalry between [[Nigel Benn]], [[Chris Eubank]], and [[Michael Watson]], which included two memorable fights and the tragic injury to Watson, followed by the emergence of [[Steve Collins]], who defeated Benn and Eubank, before retiring and vacating the title, as well as the 10-year reign of [[Joe Calzaghe]]. In addition, fellow Brits [[Richie Woodhall]] and [[Robin Reid (boxer)|Robin Reid]] also held versions of the title between 1996\u201397 and 1997-98. During this decade, Americans [[James Toney]] and [[Roy Jones Jr.]] also reigned as champions.

[[BoxRec]]. Retrieved 2015-06-07.</ref>\n\n==Boxing==\nIn [[professional boxing]], super middleweight is contested between the [[middleweight]] and [[light heavyweight]] divisions, in which boxers can weigh between 160 pounds (73 kg) and {{convert|168|lb|kg}}. The class first appeared in 1967.\n\n[[Joe Calzaghe]] and [[Sven Ottke]] jointly hold the record for most consecutive title defenses in this division, with 21 defenses of the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] titles respectively.\n\n===History===\n====1960s&ndash;1983====\nThere was interest in a division between middleweight and light heavyweight in the late 1960s, the mid-1970s, and the early 1980s. A few states briefly recognized a \"Junior Light Heavyweight\" division at {{convert|167|lb|kg}} and the fringe World Athletic Association (WAA) later inaugurated a \"super middleweight\" division at {{convert|168|lb|kg}}. On April 3, 1967, in Salt Lake City, Utah, [[Don Fullmer]], a brother of former world middleweight champion [[Gene Fullmer]], won the first version by stopping previously unbeaten Joe Hopkins in six rounds. He never defended it. On November 25, 1974, in Columbus, Ohio, Billy Douglas, the father of future world heavyweight champion [[James \"Buster\" Douglas]], halted Danny Brewer in two rounds to win the Ohio Commission's version of the world junior light heavyweight title. He too never made a defense of the title. Then, on April 3, 1982, in Denver, Colorado, Jerry \"Wimpy\" Halstead stopped Ron Brown in six rounds to win the WAA's inaugural super middleweight title bout. Halstead made one defense, knocking out Darren Encline in one round on May 29, 1982, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Following that fight, Halstead moved up to the light heavyweight class and eventually campaigned as a heavyweight. The media and most commissions did not recognize Fullmer's, Douglas', or Halstead's titles. Nor did they recognize the division during this period.<ref>{{cite book | last = Mullan | first = Harry | title = The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Boxing | publisher = Carlton Books | year = 1996 | location = London, England | isbn = 0-7858-0641-5 | page = 150}}</ref>\n\n====1984&ndash;1989====\nThe current super middleweight division traces its beginning to 1984, when [[Murray Sutherland]] defeated Ernie Singletary for the [[International Boxing Federation]] version of the title. The [[World Boxing Association]] created its version of the super middleweight title when reigning [[Lineal championship|''Lineal'']] champion [[Chong Pal Park]] defeated Jesus Gallardo in 1987 (Park had been IBF champion before relinquishing the title to fight for the inaugural WBA version).  The [[World Boxing Council]] crowned its first champion in 1988 when [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] defeated [[Donny Lalonde]] in a fight that was also for its version of the light heavyweight title.\n\n====1990&ndash;2007====\nSince the early 1990s, there has been a highly competitive super middleweight division in Britain and Ireland, including the rivalry between [[Nigel Benn]], [[Chris Eubank]], and [[Michael Watson]], which included two memorable fights and the tragic injury to Watson, followed by the emergence of [[Steve Collins]], who defeated Benn and Eubank, before retiring and vacating the title, as well as the 10-year reign of [[Joe Calzaghe]]. In addition, fellow Brits [[Richie Woodhall]] and [[Robin Reid (boxer)|Robin Reid]] also held versions of the title between 1996\u201397 and 1997-98. During this decade, Americans [[James Toney]] and [[Roy Jones Jr.]] also reigned as champions. In 2007, two champions of the division, the undefeated Calzaghe and the likewise undefeated [[Mikkel Kessler]], had a title unification fight which Calzaghe won by a unanimous decision to become the undisputed super middleweight champion of the world.\n\n====2008&ndash;present====\nAt the end of the 2000s and start of the 2010s the division was one of the most active in boxing with the likes of [[Lucian Bute]], [[Andre Ward]], [[Andre Dirrell]], [[Carl Froch]], [[Mikkel Kessler]], [[Anthony Mundine]], [[Arthur Abraham]], [[Robert Stieglitz]], [[Sakio Bika]], [[Allan Green]], [[Jesse Brinkley]], [[Librado Andrade]], [[Edison Miranda]] and [[Jermain Taylor]].

Over the following decades, Holloway would appear with [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[Lon Chaney Jr]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Bing Crosby]], and [[John Carradine]].  In 1942, during [[World War II]], Holloway enlisted in the [[United States Army]] at the age of 37 and was assigned to the [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]]. He helped develop a show called \"Hey Rookie\", which ran for nine months and raised $350,000 for the Army Relief Fund. In 1945, Holloway played the role of a medic assigned to an infantry platoon in the critically acclaimed film ''[[A Walk in the Sun (1945 film)|A Walk in the Sun]]''. During 1946 and 1947, he played the comic sidekick in five [[Gene Autry]] Westerns.<ref name=\"sidekick\">Rothel.</ref>\n\n===With Walt Disney===\n\n[[Walt Disney]] originally considered Holloway for the voice of Sleepy in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), but chose [[Pinto Colvig]] instead. Holloway's voice work in animated films began with ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), as the voice of Mr. Stork. Holloway was the voice of the adult Flower in ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942), the narrator of the Antarctic penguin sequence in ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1944) and the narrator in the ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' sequence of ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' (1946).\n\nHe was the voice of the [[Cheshire Cat]] in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951), the narrator in ''[[The Little House]]'' (1952), ''[[Susie the Little Blue Coupe]]'' (1952), [[Lambert the Sheepish Lion]] (1952), [[Kaa]] the snake in ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967), and Roquefort in ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970). He is perhaps best remembered as the voice of [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]] in Disney's ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' featurettes through 1977. He was honored as a [[Disney Legend]] in 1991, the first person to receive the award in the Voice category. His final role was Hobe Carpenter, a friendly moonshiner who helps Harley Thomas (David Carradine) in ''[[Thunder and Lightning (1977 film)|Thunder and Lightning]]'' (1977).\n\n===Radio and recordings===\n\nHolloway acted on many radio programs, including ''[[The Railroad Hour]]'', ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'', ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'' and ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]''. In the late 1940s, he could be heard in various roles on [[NBC]]'s \"[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]\". His voice retained a touch of its Southern drawl and was instantly recognizable. Holloway was chosen to narrate many children's records, including ''Uncle Remus Stories'' (Decca), ''Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes'' (Disneyland Records), ''Walt Disney Presents Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories'' (Disneyland Records) and ''Peter And The Wolf'' (RCA Victor).\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Life of riley 1957.JPG|thumb|right|Holloway with [[William Bendix]] on ''The Life of Riley'', 1957]]\n[[File:Andy Griffith Sterling Holloway Andy Griffith Show 1962.JPG|thumb|left|Holloway with [[Andy Griffith]] on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', 1962]]\nHolloway easily made the transition from radio to television. He appeared on the ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' as \"Uncle Oscar\", an eccentric inventor, and played a recurring role on ''[[The Life of Riley]]''. He guest-starred on [[Fred Waring]]'s [[CBS]] television program in the 1950s and appeared on ''[[Circus Boy]]'' as a hot air [[balloon]]ist. Some other series on which he performed include ''[[Five Fingers (TV series)|Five Fingers]]'' (episode \"The Temple of the Swinging Doll\"), ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[The Real McCoys]]'' (\"The Jinx\"), ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'', ''[[Pete and Gladys]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' (\"[[What's in the Box]]\"), ''[[The Brothers Brannagan]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Donald O'Connor Show]]'', ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', ''[[F Troop]]'', and ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. During the 1970s, Holloway did [[Television advertisement|commercial]] [[voice-over]]s for [[Purina Puppy Chow]] dog food and sang their familiar jingle, \"Puppy Chow/For a full year/Till he's full-grown!\". He also provided the voice for [[Woodsy Owl]] in several 1970s and 1980s [[United States Forest Service]] commercials. In 1982 he auditioned for the well-known comic book character [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] but lost to [[Lorenzo Music]].  In 1984, he provided voice-over work for a commercial for [[Libby's]] baked beans.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvF_7PTXZPw|title=Libbys Baked Beans 1984|date=January 11, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Final years, death and legacy==\nHolloway was a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who supported the campaign of [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] during the 1956 United States presidential election.<ref>''Motion Picture and Television Magazine'', November 1955 , page 33, Ideal Publishers</ref> Holloway adhered to [[Methodism]].<ref>Morning News, January 10, 1948, ''Who Was Who in America'' (Vol. 2)</ref>\n\nNever married, Holloway once claimed this was because he felt lacking in nothing and did not wish to disturb his pattern of life.<ref name=\"sidekick\"/>\n\nHolloway died from a [[cardiac arrest]] on November 22, 1992, in a [[Los Angeles]] hospital.

His mother was Rebecca DeHaven Boothby (1879-1963). He had a younger brother named Boothby (1909-1978). The family owned a grocery store in Cedartown, where his father served as mayor in 1912. After graduating from [[Georgia Military Academy]] in 1920 at the age of fifteen, he left Georgia for [[New York City]], where he attended the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]].<ref name=JColl-SH/>  While there, he befriended actor [[Spencer Tracy]], whom he considered one of his favorite working colleagues.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Motion pictures and shorts===\nIn his late teens, Holloway toured with stock company of ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=The Shepherd of the Hills |url=https://cladriteradio.com/tag/the-shepherd-of-the-hills/ |website=Cladirite Radio |publisher=Cladrite Radio |accessdate=5 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=It's Pure Sterling! |url=http://kdmccrite.com/its-pure-sterling/ |website=Kdmccrite |publisher=Kdmccrite |accessdate=5 August 2018}}</ref> performing in one-nighters across much of the [[American West]] before returning to New York where he accepted small walk-on parts from the [[Theatre Guild]], and appeared in the [[Rodgers and Hart]] revue ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'' in the mid-1920s. A talented singer, he introduced \"[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]\" in 1925, and the following year sang \"[[Mountain Greenery]]\".<ref name=JColl-SH>{{cite web |last=Collura |first=Joe |title=Sterling Holloway: A Way with Words|url=http://www.classicimages.com/people/article_d1e83b0a-0ae0-51f3-88c3-c9078ce4d535.html |publisher=Classic Images |date=July 7, 2008 |accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe moved to Hollywood in 1926 to begin a film career that lasted almost 50 years. His bushy red hair and high pitched voice meant that he almost always appeared in comedies. His first film was ''The Battling Kangaroo'' (1926), a silent picture. Over the following decades, Holloway would appear with [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[Lon Chaney Jr]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Bing Crosby]], and [[John Carradine]].  In 1942, during [[World War II]], Holloway enlisted in the [[United States Army]] at the age of 37 and was assigned to the [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]]. He helped develop a show called \"Hey Rookie\", which ran for nine months and raised $350,000 for the Army Relief Fund. In 1945, Holloway played the role of a medic assigned to an infantry platoon in the critically acclaimed film ''[[A Walk in the Sun (1945 film)|A Walk in the Sun]]''. During 1946 and 1947, he played the comic sidekick in five [[Gene Autry]] Westerns.<ref name=\"sidekick\">Rothel.</ref>\n\n===With Walt Disney===\n\n[[Walt Disney]] originally considered Holloway for the voice of Sleepy in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), but chose [[Pinto Colvig]] instead. Holloway's voice work in animated films began with ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), as the voice of Mr. Stork. Holloway was the voice of the adult Flower in ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942), the narrator of the Antarctic penguin sequence in ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1944) and the narrator in the ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' sequence of ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' (1946).\n\nHe was the voice of the [[Cheshire Cat]] in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951), the narrator in ''[[The Little House]]'' (1952), ''[[Susie the Little Blue Coupe]]'' (1952), [[Lambert the Sheepish Lion]] (1952), [[Kaa]] the snake in ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967), and Roquefort in ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970). He is perhaps best remembered as the voice of [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]] in Disney's ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' featurettes through 1977. He was honored as a [[Disney Legend]] in 1991, the first person to receive the award in the Voice category. His final role was Hobe Carpenter, a friendly moonshiner who helps Harley Thomas (David Carradine) in ''[[Thunder and Lightning (1977 film)|Thunder and Lightning]]'' (1977).\n\n===Radio and recordings===\n\nHolloway acted on many radio programs, including ''[[The Railroad Hour]]'', ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'', ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'' and ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]''. In the late 1940s, he could be heard in various roles on [[NBC]]'s \"[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]\". His voice retained a touch of its Southern drawl and was instantly recognizable. Holloway was chosen to narrate many children's records, including ''Uncle Remus Stories'' (Decca), ''Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes'' (Disneyland Records), ''Walt Disney Presents Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories'' (Disneyland Records) and ''Peter And The Wolf'' (RCA Victor).\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Life of riley 1957.JPG|thumb|right|Holloway with [[William Bendix]] on ''The Life of Riley'', 1957]]\n[[File:Andy Griffith Sterling Holloway Andy Griffith Show 1962.JPG|thumb|left|Holloway with [[Andy Griffith]] on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', 1962]]\nHolloway easily made the transition from radio to television. He appeared on the ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' as \"Uncle Oscar\", an eccentric inventor, and played a recurring role on ''[[The Life of Riley]]''. He guest-starred on [[Fred Waring]]'s [[CBS]] television program in the 1950s and appeared on ''[[Circus Boy]]'' as a hot air [[balloon]]ist. Some other series on which he performed include ''[[Five Fingers (TV series)|Five Fingers]]'' (episode \"The Temple of the Swinging Doll\"), ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[The Real McCoys]]'' (\"The Jinx\"), ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'', ''[[Pete and Gladys]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' (\"[[What's in the Box]]\"), ''[[The Brothers Brannagan]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Donald O'Connor Show]]'', ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', ''[[F Troop]]'', and ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. During the 1970s, Holloway did [[Television advertisement|commercial]] [[voice-over]]s for [[Purina Puppy Chow]] dog food and sang their familiar jingle, \"Puppy Chow/For a full year/Till he's full-grown!\". He also provided the voice for [[Woodsy Owl]] in several 1970s and 1980s [[United States Forest Service]] commercials. In 1982 he auditioned for the well-known comic book character [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] but lost to [[Lorenzo Music]].
