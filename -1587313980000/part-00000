The Bohemian border with [[Bavaria]] was inhabited primarily by Germans. The [[Upper Palatine Forest]], which extends along the Bavarian frontier and into the agricultural areas of southern [[Bohemia]], was an area of German settlement. [[Moravia]] contained patches of \"locked\" German territory to the north and south. More characteristic were the German [[language island]]s, which were towns inhabited by German minorities and surrounded by Czechs. Sudeten Germans were mostly [[Roman Catholics]], a legacy of centuries of [[Austrian Habsburg]] rule.\n\nNot all ethnic Germans lived in isolated and well-defined areas; for historical reasons, Czechs and Germans mixed in many places, and Czech-German bilingualism was quite common. Nevertheless, in the second half of the 19th century, Czechs and Germans began to create separate cultural, educational, political and economic institutions, which kept both groups semiisolated from each other. That form of separation continued until the end of the Second World War, when almost all Germans were expelled.\n\n[[File:Sudetendeutsche.png|thumb|200px|right|Czech districts by ethnic German population in 1930:<ref>{{cite book|title=Statistick\u00fd lexikon obc\u00ed v Republice \u010deskoslovensk\u00e9 I.

Though they were living beyond the medieval [[Kingdom of Germany]], an independent German Bohemian awareness, however, was not widespread, and for a long time, it played no decisive role in everyday life. Individuals were usually seen as Bohemians, Moravians or Silesians. Defining events later in German Bohemian history were the [[Hussite Wars]], the occupation of Bohemia by the [[Czech Brethren]], the [[Thirty Years\u2019 War]], when the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were severely affected, which caused the immigration of further German settlers.\n\nAfter the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] in the 1526 [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] became King of Bohemia, which became a constituent state of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. With the rise of the Habsburgs in Bohemia after the 1620 [[Battle of White Mountain]], the old [[Bohemian nobility]] became virtually meaningless.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Increasingly, the Bohemian crown lands were ruled from the Austrian capital, [[Vienna]], which favoured the dominance of the [[German language]] and [[German culture]].<ref>Manfred Alexander: ''Kleine Geschichte der b\u00f6hmischen L\u00e4nder,'' Reclam, Stuttgart 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-15-010655-6}}.</ref> On the other hand, the 18th-century [[Silesian Wars]] started by Prussian King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II of Prussia]] against Austria resulted in the loss of the traditionally-Bohemian crown land and weakened Germans in the remaining parts of Bohemia.

Cities like Prague, however, saw more mixing between the ethnicities and also had large populations of [[Jews]]. Jews in Bohemia often spoke German and sometimes [[Yiddish]]. The famed writer [[Franz Kafka]] exemplifies the diversity of Bohemia since he was a German-speaking Prague-based Jew, but his surname was of Czech origin.<ref>Brod, Max (1960).

The agreement established the Dual Monarchy and gave the [[Hungarians]] sovereignty over their own affairs. The preservation of German cultural dominance throughout [[Cisleithania]] had proved to be difficult and now seemed to be was utterly impossible.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nWith the agreement, the desire for an autonomous Czech subdivision was mounting. Both German Bohemians and Czechs were hoping for a constitutional solution to the demands, but Czech nationalist views remained a constant part of the Bohemian political sphere.

Its Czech students had become increasingly perturbed by the sole use of German for instruction. During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|1848 revolution]], both Germans and Czechs fought to make Czech one of the university's official languages.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://www.cuni.cz/UKEN-106.html|title=History of Charles University|author=|date=|website=cuni.cz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> They achieved that right, and the university became bilingual. By 1863, out of 187 lecture courses, 22 were held in Czech, the remainder being in German. In 1864, some Germans suggested the creation of a separate Czech university. Czech professors rejected that because they did not wish to lose the continuity of university traditions.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nThe Czechs, however, were still not satisfied with bilingual status and proposed creating two separate constituent [[college]]s, one for the Germans and one for the Czechs. The Germans vetoed the proposal and called for a full division of the university. After long negotiations, it was divided into the German Charles-Ferdinand University and the Czech Charles-Ferdinand University. The Cisleithanian Imperial Council prepared an act of parliament, and the emperor granted [[royal assent]] on 28 February 1882.<ref>{{cite book | chapterurl = http://libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t73.html | first = Franti\u0161ek | last = \u010capka | title = D\u011bjiny zem\u00ed Koruny \u010desk\u00e9 v datech | chapter = X.

Electoral officials were very careful to demarcate areas as clearly either German or Czech and to assure that there would be no conflict as to which ethnicity had a majority in any constituency. Nevertheless, that did not settle tensions among Czechs, who wanted to govern themselves from Prague.\n\nArchduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] came up with a plan, known as the [[United States of Greater Austria]], in 1909. German Bohemia, as it was to be called, was going to be separated from the Czech areas around it in the plan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Prinz |first=Friedrich |title=Deutsche Geschichte in Osten Europas: B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Deutsche_Geschichte_im_Osten_Europas_B\u00f6.html?id=MmwjAQAAIAAJ |accessdate= 25 February 2013 |year=1993 |publisher=Wolf Jobst Siedler Verlag GmbH |location=Berlin |isbn=3-88680-200-0 |page=381 |pages=}}\n</ref> That would create ethnically-homogenous self-governing provinces that would hopefully end the ethnic conflict. However, [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand was assassinated]], and the [[First World War]] destroyed all hopes for a redrawn Cisleithania.\n\n==Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye==\nThe end of the war in 1918 brought about the partition of the multiethnic [[Austria-Hungary]] into its historical components, one of them, the [[Bohemian Kingdom]], forming the west of the newly-created Czechoslovakia. Czech politicians insisted on the traditional boundaries of the [[Bohemian Crown]] according to the principle of ''[[uti possidetis juris]]''. The new Czech state would thus have defensible mountain boundaries with Germany, but the highly-industrialised settlement areas of three million Germans would now be separated from Austria and come under Czech control.\n\nThe Austrian head of goverment, [[Ernst Seidler von Feuchtenegg]], wanted to divide Bohemia by setting up administrative counties (''Verwaltungskreisen''), which would be based on the nationalities of the population. On 26 September 1918, his successor, [[Max Hussarek von Heinlein]], offered the Czechs wide-ranging autonomy within Imperial and Royal Austria. However, because exiled Czechs had already achieved the entrance of the [[United States]] in the war as an associate power of the [[Triple Entente]]. Also, Austria was no longer considered to be a major power by the victors of the war.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n===Province of German Bohemia===\nOn 14 October, Raphael Pacher succeeded, together with the social democrat, Josef Seliger, to unite all German parties and members of parliament in Bohemia and Moravia into a coalition. In preparation for the foundation of the Republic of German Bohemia, the coalition, chaired by Pacher, appointed a committee of twelve members. One day after the proclamation of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, on 29 October 1918, the [[Province of German Bohemia]] was formed with its capital in [[Liberec|Reichenberg]]. Its first governor was Raphael Pacher, who transferred his office on 5 November to Rudolf Lodgman von Auen.\n\nThe Province of German Bohemia comprised a contiguous region in North and West Bohemia that stretched from the [[Egerland]] to the Braunau region along the border with the German Empire.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> In South Bohemia the administrative unit of B\u00f6hmerwaldgau emerged, which was to be part of [[Upper Austria]]. German Bohemia in the [[Orlick\u00e9 hory|Eagle Mountains]] and in the area of [[Lan\u0161kroun|Landskron]] merged with the so-called \"Province of the Sudetenland\", which had radically different borders than the later understanding of the term. The Bohemian district of [[Nov\u00e1 Byst\u0159ice|Neubistritz]] was incorporated into [[Znojmo|Znaim]] and was supposed to be administered by Lower Austria. The judiciary for German Bohemia was based in Reichenberg, and [[Vienna]] was responsible for the other German regions.\nOn 22 November 1918, the Province of German Bohemia proclaimed itself part of the state of [[German Austria]]. On the same day, the territory of German Austria was defined by the Act of the \"Provisional National Assembly\" (''Provisorische Nationalversammlung''), which included German Bohemian and German Moravian members of the former [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Cisleithanian Imperial Council]].<ref>[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/alex?apm=0&aid=sgb&datum=19180004&seite=00000051&size=45 Act, StGBl.

The German Bohemians relied mostly on peaceful opposition to the occupation of their homeland by the Czech military, which started on 31 October 1918 and was completed on 28 January 1919. Fighting took place sporadically, resulting in the deaths of a few dozen Germans and Czechs.\n\nOn 4 March 1919, almost the entire ethnic German population peacefully demonstrated for its right to self-determination.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The demonstrations were accompanied by a one-day general strike. The [[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic]], then the largest party, was responsible for the demonstration initiative, but it was also supported by other bourgeois German parties. The mass demonstrations were put down by the Czech military, involving 54 deaths and 84 wounded.<ref>[http://www.cas.umn.edu/assets/pdf/wp061.pdf Suppan, Arnold: ''Austrians, Czechs, and Sudeten Germans as a Community of Conflict in the Twentieth Century'', p. 9]</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], on 10 September 1919, made it clear that German Bohemia would not become part of the new [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]]. Instead, it would become part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The new state regarded ethnic Germans as an [[ethnic minority]]. Nevertheless, some 90 percent lived in territories in which they represented 90 percent or more of the population.\n\n===Demography===\nIn 1921, the population of multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia comprised 6.6&nbsp;million Czechs, 3.2&nbsp;million Germans, two million [[Slovaks]], 0.7&nbsp;million [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], half a million [[Ruthenians]] (Rusyns), 300,000 [[Jew]]s, and 100,000 [[Poles]], as well as [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Croats]] and other ethnic groups.<ref name=autogenerated6 /><ref name=autogenerated7 /><ref name=autogenerated5 /> German-speakers represented a third of the population of the [[Czech lands|Bohemian lands]] and about 23.4 percent of the population of the whole republic (13.6&nbsp;million).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\nThe Sudetenland possessed huge chemical works and [[lignite]] mines as well as textile, china, and glass factories. To the west, a triangle of historic ethnic German settlement surrounding [[Cheb|Eger]] was the most active area for pan-German nationalism.  \nThe [[Upper Palatinate Forest]], an area that was primarily populated by Germans, extended along the Bavarian frontier to the poor agricultural areas of southern [[Bohemia]].\n\n[[Moravia]] contained many patches of ethnic German settlement in the north and the south. Most typical in those areas were German \"language islands\", towns inhabited by ethnic Germans but surrounded by rural Czechs.  Extreme German nationalism was never prevalent in those areas. German nationalism in the coal-mining region of southern [[Silesia]], which was 40.5% German, was restrained by fear of competition from industry in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n==Gradual general acceptance of Czechoslovak citizenship==\n[[File:Czechoslovakia 1930 linguistic map - created 2008-10-30.svg|thumb|250px|Linguistic map of Czechoslovakia in 1930]]\nMany Germans felt that the new constitution failed to fulfill what the Czechs had promised in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] because there were too few minority rights. However, they gradually accepted remaining in Czechoslovakia and took part in the first elections in 1920. In 1926, the first Germans became minister ([[Robert Mayr-Harting]] and [[Franz Spina]]), and the first German political party became part of the government ([[German Christian Social People's Party]] and [[Farmers' League]]).<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/talking/hitlers-fifth-column \"Hitler's Fifth Column\"]. Radio Prague. December 12, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nGerman nationalist sentiment ran high during the early years of the republic. Sudeten representatives tried to join Austria or Germany or at least to obtain as much autonomy. The constitution of 1920 was drafted without Sudeten German representation,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and Sudetens declined to participate in the election of the president. Sudeten political parties pursued an \"obstructionist\" (or negativist) policy in the Czechoslovak parliament. In 1926, however, German Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]], adopting a policy of rapprochement with the West, advised the Sudeten Germans to co-operate actively with the Czechoslovak government. In consequence, most Sudeten German parties (including the German Agrarian Party, the German Social Democratic Party and the German Christian Socialist People's Party) changed their policy from negativism to activism, and several Sudeten politicians even accepted cabinet posts.\n\n[[File:1._m\u00e1j_1938_v_Liberci_2.gif|thumb|250px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]] on 1 May 1938 in [[Liberec]]]]\nAt a party conference in [[Teplitz]] in 1919, the provincial Social Femocratic Parties of Bohemia, Moravia and Sudeten-Silesia united to form the ''[[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic|Deutsche Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei]]'' (DSAP) and elected Josef Seliger as chairman. After Seliger's untimely death in 1920, [[Ludwig Czech]] became party chairman, who was succeeded in 1938 by [[Wenzel Jaksch]].\n\nAlready in 1936, Jaksch, together with [[Hans Sch\u00fctz]] of the [[German Christian Social People's Party]] (''Deutsche Christlich-Soziale Volkspartei'') and [[Gustav Hacker]] of the Farmers' Association (''Bund der Landwirte'', formed the ''[[Jungaktivisten]]'' (Young Activists). They sought agreement with the Czechoslovak government on a policy that could withstand the Nazi onslaught from within and from outside Czechoslovakia. At simultaneous mass rallies in [[D\u011b\u010d\u00edn|Tetschen-Bodenbach/D\u011b\u010d\u00edn]], [[\u017datec|Saaz/\u017datec]] and [[Ole\u0161nice v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch|Ole\u0161nice v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch/Gie\u00dfh\u00fcbl im Adlergebirge]] on April 26, 1936, they demanded equal opportunities in civil service for Germans, financial assistance for German businesses, official acceptance of the [[German language]] for public servants in the Sudetenland and measures to reduce unemployment in the Sudetenland. (At the time, one in three was unemployed in the Sudetenland, compared to one in five in the rest of the country.) Improving the quality of life of the Sudeten Germans was not the only motivation of the Jungaktivists. For Jaksch and his social democratic compatriots, it was a question of survival after a possible Nazi takeover. Of some 80,000 social democrats in Czechoslovakia, only about 5,000 would manage to flee the Nazis. The rest were incarcerated, and many of them were executed. Many of those who survived the Nazi persecution were later expelled, together with other Sudeten Germans, on the basis of [[Bene\u0161 decrees]].\n\nBy 1929, only a small number of Sudeten German deputies, most of them members of the German National Party, supported by the propertied classes, and the [[German National Socialist Workers' Party (Czechoslovakia)|German National Socialist Workers' Party]], remained opposed to the Czechoslovak government. Nationalist sentiment flourished, however, among Sudeten German youths, who had a variety of organizations, such as the older ''Deutsche Turnverband'' and ''Schutzvereine'', the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', the Nazi ''[[Volkssport]]'' (1929) and the ''Bereitschaft''.\n\n==Rise of Nazis==\n<!--[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|left|Flag flown by Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]-->\n[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|Flag flown by some Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1986-042-14, Anschluss sudetendeutscher Gebiete.jpg|right|thumb|280px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps|Sudeten German Freikorps]]]]\nThe Sudeten German nationalists, particularly the Nazis, expanded their activities after the Depression started. On 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed chancellor of Germany. The Czechoslovak government prepared to suppress the Sudeten Nazi Party. In the autumn of 1933, the Sudeten Nazis dissolved their organization, and the German Nationals were pressured to do likewise. The government expelled German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis from local government positions. The Sudeten German population was indignant, especially in nationalist strongholds like [[Egerland]].\n\nOn 1 October 1933, [[Konrad Henlein]] with his deputy, [[Karl Hermann Frank]], aided by other members of the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', a youth organization of mystical orientation, created a new political organisation. The [[Sudeten German Home Front]] (''Sudetendeutsche Heimatfront'') professed loyalty to Czechoslovakia but championed decentralization. It absorbed most former German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis.\n\nIn 1935, the Sudeten German Home Front became the [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'') (SdP) and embarked on an active propaganda campaign. In the May election, the SdP won more than 60% of the Sudeten German vote. The German Agrarians, Christian Socialists and Social Democrats each lost approximately half of their followers. The SdP became the centre of German nationalist forces. The party represented itself as striving for a just settlement of Sudeten German claims within the framework of Czechoslovak democracy.  Henlein, however, maintained secret contact with [[Nazi Germany]] and received material aid from [[Berlin]], which told him to refuse every concession offered by Czechoslovakia. The SdP endorsed the idea of a ''F\u00fchrer'' and mimicked Nazi methods with banners, slogans and uniformed troops. Concessions offered by the Czechoslovak government, including the installation of exclusively Sudeten German officials in Sudeten German areas and the possible participation of the SdP in the cabinet, were rejected.  By 1937, most SdP leaders supported Hitler's pan-German objectives.\n\nOn 13 March 1938, the [[Third Reich]] annexed [[Austria]] during the ''[[Anschluss]]''.  Immediately, many Sudeten Germans supported Henlein. On 22 March, the German Agrarian Party, led by [[Gustav Hacker]], merged with the SdP. [[German Christian Social People\u2019s Party|German Christian Socialists]] in Czechoslovakia suspended their activities on 24 March; their deputies and senators entered the SdP parliamentary club. Although the Social Democrats continued to champion democratic freedoms, the masses supported the SdP.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies (1920\u20131935)===\nThe table below shows the number of seats German parties and German\u2013Hungarian lists gained in the Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies between 1920 and 1935.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Party or List<ref>[http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/sudeten.html \"Prager Tagblatt\", Nr. 116 du 18 Mai 1935, ''Tschechoslowakische Parlamentswahl'' vom 19. 5. 1935]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/T80IHC,1,0,Republik_unter_Druck.html|title=Republik unter Druck - bpb|first=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr politische|last=Bildung|date=|website=www.bpb.de|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n!Seats 1920\n!Seats 1925\n!Seats 1929\n!Seats 1935\n!Votes 1935\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sudeten German Party]]\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|44\n|1.256.010\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German National Party]]\n| -\n|10\n|7\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sudeten German National Socialist Party|German National Socialist Workers Party]]\n|15\n|17\n|8\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic|German Social Democratic Workers Party]]\n|31\n|17\n|21\n|11\n|300.406\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German Christian Social People's Party]]\n|7\n|13\n|14\n|6\n|163.666\n|- align=\"center\"\n|German Union of Farmers\n|11\n|24\n| -\n|5\n|142.775\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Hungarian Parties and Sudeten German Electoral Bloc\n|9\n|4\n|9\n|9\n|292.847\n|- align=\"center\"\n|United German Parties\n|6\n| -\n|16\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|'''Total (out of 300 seats)'''\n|79\n|85\n|75\n|75\n|\n|}\n\n* <small>Hungarian Parties and Sudeten German Electoral Bloc (1935): German Democratic Liberal Party, German Industrialist Party, Party of German Nation, Sudeten German Land Union, German Workers Party, Zips German Party, Provincial Christian Social Party, Hungarian National Party<ref>[http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/sudeten.html \"Prager Tagblatt\", Nr. 116, May 18, 1935, ''Tschechoslowakische Parlamentswahl'' vom 19. 5. 1935]</ref></small>\n\n==Munich Agreements==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H12751, Godesberg, Vorbereitung M\u00fcnchener Abkommen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Unsmiling, [[Neville Chamberlain]] (left) and [[Adolf Hitler]] leave the Bad Godesberg meeting on 23 September 1938.]]\n[[File:Konrad Henlein v Karlov\u00fdch Varech 1937.jpg|thumb|right|Henlein speaking in [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]], 1937]]\n[[File:Teroristick\u00e1 akce sudeton\u011bmeck\u00e9ho Freikorpsu.jpg|thumb|right|A 1938 terrorist action of [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps|Sudeten German Voluntary Force]]]]\n[[Image:SN zamaz\u00e1vaj\u00ed \u010desk\u00fd n\u00e1zev \u0160umperk.gif|250px|thumb|right|In [[\u0160umperk|\u0160umperk-M\u00e4hrisch Sch\u00f6nberg]], Czech names were erased by the Sudeten Germans after the German annexation of [[Sudetenland]] in 1938.]]\n[[Konrad Henlein]] met with Hitler in Berlin on 28 March 1938 and was tolf to raise demands that would be unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. In the Carlsbad Decrees, issued on 24 April, the SdP demanded complete autonomy for the Sudetenland and freedom to profess Nazi ideology. If Henlein's demands had been granted, the Sudetenland would have been in a position to align itself with Nazi Germany.\n\nAs the political situation worsened, the security in Sudetenland deteriorated. The region became the site of small-scale clashes between young SdP followers,equipped with arms smuggled from Germany, and police and border forces. In some places, the regular army was called in to pacify the situation. Nazi propaganda accused the Czech government and Czechs of atrocities on innocent Germans. The Czechoslovaki public started to prepare for an inevitable war such as by training with gas masks.\n\nOn 20 May, Czechoslovakia initiated a so-called \"partial mobilization\" (literally \"special military precaution\") in response to rumours of German troop movements. The army moved into position on the border. Western powers tried to calm down the situation and forced Czechoslovakia to comply with most of the Carlsbad Decrees. However the SdP, instructed to continue to push towards war, escalated the situation with more protests and violence.\n\nWith the help of special Nazi forces, the ''Sudetendeutsche Freikorps'' (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-instructors) took over some border areas and committed many crimes: they killed more than 110 Czechoslovaks (mostly soldiers and policemen) and kidnapped over 2,020 Czechoslovak citizens (including German antifascists), taking them to [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=zimmermann>Zimmermann, Volker: 'Die Sudetendeutschen im NS-Staat.

I believe these complaints to be in the main justified. Even as late as the time of my Mission, I could find no readiness on the part of the Czechoslovak Government to remedy them on anything like an adequate scale... the feeling among the Sudeten Germans until about three or four years ago was one of hopelessness. But the rise of Nazi Germany gave them new hope. I regard their turning for help towards their kinsmen and their eventual desire to join the Reich as a natural development in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n\nBritain and France then pressured the Czechoslovak government into ceding the Sudetenland to Germany on 21 September. The [[Munich Agreement]], signed September 29 by Britain, France, Germany and Italy and negotiated without Czechoslovak participation, only confirmed that decision and the negotiated details. Czechoslovakia ceded a German-defined maximalist extension of Sudetenland to Germany, including the [[\u0160koda Works]]; near [[Pilsen]], they had been Czechoslovakia's primary armaments factory.\n\nAs a result, Bohemia and Moravia lost about 38 percent of their combined area, and 3.65&nbsp;million inhabitants (2.82&nbsp;million Germans<ref name=\"bruntal.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bruntal.net/2007072602-k-otazce-vysidleni-obcanu-csr-ze-sudet-tesinska-podkarpatske-rusi-a-slovenske-republiky-v-letech-1938-1939 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141202131759/http://www.bruntal.net/2007072602-k-otazce-vysidleni-obcanu-csr-ze-sudet-tesinska-podkarpatske-rusi-a-slovenske-republiky-v-letech-1938-1939 |archive-date=2014-12-02 |df= }}</ref> and approximately 513,000 - 750,000<ref name=\"bruntal.net\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bohumildolezal.cz/texty/u074-08.htm|title=Fakta o vyhn\u00e1n\u00ed \u010cech\u016f ze Sudet|first=Bohumil|last=Dole\u017eal|date=|website=www.bohumildolezal.cz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Czechs to Germany).\n\n==Under Nazi rule==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H13160, Beim Einmarsch deutscher Truppen in Eger.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Sudeten Germans greeting Hitler with the [[Nazi salute]] after he crossed the border into Czechoslovakia in 1938.]]\n\nSome 250,000 Germans remained on the Czech side of the border, which later became part of the Reich by the establishment of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] under German governors and the German Army.  Almost all the Germans in these Czech territories were subsequently granted German citizenship,<ref>Smlouva mezi \u010cesko-Slovenskou republikou a N\u011bmeckou \u0159\u00ed\u0161\u00ed o ot\u00e1zk\u00e1ch st\u00e1tn\u00edho ob\u010danstv\u00ed a opce, law no. 300/1938 Sb.</ref> while most of the Germans in Slovakia obtained citizenship of the [[Slovak state]].\n\nWith the establishment of German rule, hundreds of thousands of Czechs who (under the policy of Czechification) had moved into the Sudetenland after 1919 left the area, some willingly.

About half a million Sudeten Germans joined the [[Nazi Party]], which amounted to 17.34% of the German population in the Sudetenland (the average in [[Nazi Germany]] was 7.85%). Because of their knowledge of the [[Czech language]], many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] as well as in the Nazi oppressive machinery such as the [[Gestapo]]. The most notable was [[Karl Hermann Frank]], the SS and Police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], German men in Slovakia usually served in the Slovak army, but more than 7,000 were members of paramilitary squads (''Freiwillige Schutzstaffeln'') and almost 2,000 volunteers joined the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.  After the beginning of the [[Slovak National uprising]] in late 1944, most of the young Germans in Slovakia were drafted in the German army, either with the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS. The very young and elderly were organized in ''Heimatschutz'', an equivalent of the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' in Germany.  The Nazis ordered some of them to take action against the partisans; others participated in deportation of Slovak Jews.<ref>Littlejohn, David: ''Foreign Legions of the Third Reich''. 1994</ref>  The Nazis evacuated about 120,000 Germans (mostly women and children) to the [[Sudetenland]] and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]].<ref name=\"zimmermann\"/>\n\n==Expulsion and transfer==\n{{Main|Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia}}\n[[File:Vertreibung.jpg|thumb|Germans expelled from Bohemia and Moravia after the Second World War]]\nIn the aftermath of World War II, when the Czechoslovak state was restored, the government expelled the majority of ethnic Germans (about 3 million altogether), in the belief that their behaviour had been a major cause of the war and subsequent destruction. In the months directly following the end of the war, \"wild\" expulsions happened from May until August 1945. Several Czechoslovak statesmen encouraged such expulsions with polemical speeches. Generally local authorities ordered the expulsions, which armed volunteers carried out.  In some cases the regular army initiated or assisted such expulsions.<ref>Biman, S. - C\u00edlek, R.: ''Posledn\u00ed mrtv\u00ed, prvn\u00ed \u017eiv\u00ed''. \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem 1989.

An estimated 1.6&nbsp;million \"ethnic Germans\" (most of them also had Czech ancestors; and even Czechs, who spoke mainly German over the last years), were deported from Czechoslovakia to the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American zone]] of what would become [[West Germany]].

Though they were living beyond the medieval [[Kingdom of Germany]], an independent German Bohemian awareness, however, was not widespread, and for a long time, it played no decisive role in everyday life. Individuals were usually seen as Bohemians, Moravians or Silesians. Defining events later in German Bohemian history were the [[Hussite Wars]], the occupation of Bohemia by the [[Czech Brethren]], the [[Thirty Years\u2019 War]], when the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were severely affected, which caused the immigration of further German settlers.\n\nAfter the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] in the 1526 [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] became King of Bohemia, which became a constituent state of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

By 1863, out of 187 lecture courses, 22 were held in Czech, the remainder being in German. In 1864, some Germans suggested the creation of a separate Czech university. Czech professors rejected that because they did not wish to lose the continuity of university traditions.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nThe Czechs, however, were still not satisfied with bilingual status and proposed creating two separate constituent [[college]]s, one for the Germans and one for the Czechs. The Germans vetoed the proposal and called for a full division of the university. After long negotiations, it was divided into the German Charles-Ferdinand University and the Czech Charles-Ferdinand University.

Electoral officials were very careful to demarcate areas as clearly either German or Czech and to assure that there would be no conflict as to which ethnicity had a majority in any constituency. Nevertheless, that did not settle tensions among Czechs, who wanted to govern themselves from Prague.\n\nArchduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] came up with a plan, known as the [[United States of Greater Austria]], in 1909. German Bohemia, as it was to be called, was going to be separated from the Czech areas around it in the plan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Prinz |first=Friedrich |title=Deutsche Geschichte in Osten Europas: B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Deutsche_Geschichte_im_Osten_Europas_B\u00f6.html?id=MmwjAQAAIAAJ |accessdate= 25 February 2013 |year=1993 |publisher=Wolf Jobst Siedler Verlag GmbH |location=Berlin |isbn=3-88680-200-0 |page=381 |pages=}}\n</ref> That would create ethnically-homogenous self-governing provinces that would hopefully end the ethnic conflict. However, [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand was assassinated]], and the [[First World War]] destroyed all hopes for a redrawn Cisleithania.\n\n==Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye==\nThe end of the war in 1918 brought about the partition of the multiethnic [[Austria-Hungary]] into its historical components, one of them, the [[Bohemian Kingdom]], forming the west of the newly-created Czechoslovakia. Czech politicians insisted on the traditional boundaries of the [[Bohemian Crown]] according to the principle of ''[[uti possidetis juris]]''. The new Czech state would thus have defensible mountain boundaries with Germany, but the highly-industrialised settlement areas of three million Germans would now be separated from Austria and come under Czech control.\n\nThe Austrian head of goverment, [[Ernst Seidler von Feuchtenegg]], wanted to divide Bohemia by setting up administrative counties (''Verwaltungskreisen''), which would be based on the nationalities of the population. On 26 September 1918, his successor, [[Max Hussarek von Heinlein]], offered the Czechs wide-ranging autonomy within Imperial and Royal Austria. However, because exiled Czechs had already achieved the entrance of the [[United States]] in the war as an associate power of the [[Triple Entente]]. Also, Austria was no longer considered to be a major power by the victors of the war.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n===Province of German Bohemia===\nOn 14 October, Raphael Pacher succeeded, together with the social democrat, Josef Seliger, to unite all German parties and members of parliament in Bohemia and Moravia into a coalition. In preparation for the foundation of the Republic of German Bohemia, the coalition, chaired by Pacher, appointed a committee of twelve members. One day after the proclamation of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, on 29 October 1918, the [[Province of German Bohemia]] was formed with its capital in [[Liberec|Reichenberg]]. Its first governor was Raphael Pacher, who transferred his office on 5 November to Rudolf Lodgman von Auen.\n\nThe Province of German Bohemia comprised a contiguous region in North and West Bohemia that stretched from the [[Egerland]] to the Braunau region along the border with the German Empire.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> In South Bohemia the administrative unit of B\u00f6hmerwaldgau emerged, which was to be part of [[Upper Austria]]. German Bohemia in the [[Orlick\u00e9 hory|Eagle Mountains]] and in the area of [[Lan\u0161kroun|Landskron]] merged with the so-called \"Province of the Sudetenland\", which had radically different borders than the later understanding of the term. The Bohemian district of [[Nov\u00e1 Byst\u0159ice|Neubistritz]] was incorporated into [[Znojmo|Znaim]] and was supposed to be administered by Lower Austria. The judiciary for German Bohemia was based in Reichenberg, and [[Vienna]] was responsible for the other German regions.\nOn 22 November 1918, the Province of German Bohemia proclaimed itself part of the state of [[German Austria]]. On the same day, the territory of German Austria was defined by the Act of the \"Provisional National Assembly\" (''Provisorische Nationalversammlung''), which included German Bohemian and German Moravian members of the former [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Cisleithanian Imperial Council]].<ref>[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/alex?apm=0&aid=sgb&datum=19180004&seite=00000051&size=45 Act, StGBl.

The German Bohemians relied mostly on peaceful opposition to the occupation of their homeland by the Czech military, which started on 31 October 1918 and was completed on 28 January 1919. Fighting took place sporadically, resulting in the deaths of a few dozen Germans and Czechs.\n\nOn 4 March 1919, almost the entire ethnic German population peacefully demonstrated for its right to self-determination.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The demonstrations were accompanied by a one-day general strike. The [[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic]], then the largest party, was responsible for the demonstration initiative, but it was also supported by other bourgeois German parties. The mass demonstrations were put down by the Czech military, involving 54 deaths and 84 wounded.<ref>[http://www.cas.umn.edu/assets/pdf/wp061.pdf Suppan, Arnold: ''Austrians, Czechs, and Sudeten Germans as a Community of Conflict in the Twentieth Century'', p. 9]</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], on 10 September 1919, made it clear that German Bohemia would not become part of the new [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]]. Instead, it would become part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The new state regarded ethnic Germans as an [[ethnic minority]]. Nevertheless, some 90 percent lived in territories in which they represented 90 percent or more of the population.\n\n===Demography===\nIn 1921, the population of multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia comprised 6.6&nbsp;million Czechs, 3.2&nbsp;million Germans, two million [[Slovaks]], 0.7&nbsp;million [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], half a million [[Ruthenians]] (Rusyns), 300,000 [[Jew]]s, and 100,000 [[Poles]], as well as [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Croats]] and other ethnic groups.<ref name=autogenerated6 /><ref name=autogenerated7 /><ref name=autogenerated5 /> German-speakers represented a third of the population of the [[Czech lands|Bohemian lands]] and about 23.4 percent of the population of the whole republic (13.6&nbsp;million).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\nThe Sudetenland possessed huge chemical works and [[lignite]] mines as well as textile, china, and glass factories. To the west, a triangle of historic ethnic German settlement surrounding [[Cheb|Eger]] was the most active area for pan-German nationalism.  \nThe [[Upper Palatinate Forest]], an area that was primarily populated by Germans, extended along the Bavarian frontier to the poor agricultural areas of southern [[Bohemia]].\n\n[[Moravia]] contained many patches of ethnic German settlement in the north and the south. Most typical in those areas were German \"language islands\", towns inhabited by ethnic Germans but surrounded by rural Czechs.  Extreme German nationalism was never prevalent in those areas. German nationalism in the coal-mining region of southern [[Silesia]], which was 40.5% German, was restrained by fear of competition from industry in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n==Gradual general acceptance of Czechoslovak citizenship==\n[[File:Czechoslovakia 1930 linguistic map - created 2008-10-30.svg|thumb|250px|Linguistic map of Czechoslovakia in 1930]]\nMany Germans felt that the new constitution failed to fulfill what the Czechs had promised in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] because there were too few minority rights. However, they gradually accepted remaining in Czechoslovakia and took part in the first elections in 1920. In 1926, the first Germans became minister ([[Robert Mayr-Harting]] and [[Franz Spina]]), and the first German political party became part of the government ([[German Christian Social People's Party]] and [[Farmers' League]]).<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/talking/hitlers-fifth-column \"Hitler's Fifth Column\"]. Radio Prague. December 12, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nGerman nationalist sentiment ran high during the early years of the republic. Sudeten representatives tried to join Austria or Germany or at least to obtain as much autonomy. The constitution of 1920 was drafted without Sudeten German representation,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and Sudetens declined to participate in the election of the president. Sudeten political parties pursued an \"obstructionist\" (or negativist) policy in the Czechoslovak parliament. In 1926, however, German Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]], adopting a policy of rapprochement with the West, advised the Sudeten Germans to co-operate actively with the Czechoslovak government. In consequence, most Sudeten German parties (including the German Agrarian Party, the German Social Democratic Party and the German Christian Socialist People's Party) changed their policy from negativism to activism, and several Sudeten politicians even accepted cabinet posts.\n\n[[File:1._m\u00e1j_1938_v_Liberci_2.gif|thumb|250px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]] on 1 May 1938 in [[Liberec]]]]\nAt a party conference in [[Teplitz]] in 1919, the provincial Social Femocratic Parties of Bohemia, Moravia and Sudeten-Silesia united to form the the ''[[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic|Deutsche Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei]]'' (DSAP) and elected Josef Seliger as chairman. After Seliger's untimely death in 1920, [[Ludwig Czech]] became party chairman, who was succeeded in 1938 by [[Wenzel Jaksch]].\n\nAlready in 1936, Jaksch, together with [[Hans Sch\u00fctz]] of the [[German Christian Social People's Party]] (''Deutsche Christlich-Soziale Volkspartei'') and [[Gustav Hacker]] of the Farmers' Association (''Bund der Landwirte'', formed the ''[[Jungaktivisten]]'' (Young Activists). They sought agreement with the Czechoslovak government on a policy that could withstand the Nazi onslaught from within and from outside Czechoslovakia.

(At the time, one in three was unemployed in the Sudetenland, compared to one in five in the rest of the country.) Improving the quality of life of the Sudeten Germans was not the only motivation of the Jungaktivists. For Jaksch and his social democratic compatriots, it was a question of survival after a possible Nazi takeover. Of some 80,000 social democrats in Czechoslovakia, only about 5,000 would manage to flee the Nazis. The rest were incarcerated, and many of them were executed. Many of those who survived the Nazi persecution were later expelled, together with other Sudeten Germans, on the basis of [[Bene\u0161 decrees]].\n\nBy 1929, only a small number of Sudeten German deputies, most of them members of the German National Party, supported by the propertied classes, and the [[German National Socialist Workers' Party (Czechoslovakia)|German National Socialist Workers' Party]], remained opposed to the Czechoslovak government. Nationalist sentiment flourished, however, among Sudeten German youths, who had a variety of organizations, such as the older ''Deutsche Turnverband'' and ''Schutzvereine'', the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', the Nazi ''[[Volkssport]]'' (1929) and the ''Bereitschaft''.\n\n==Rise of Nazis==\n<!--[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|left|Flag flown by Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]-->\n[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|Flag flown by some Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1986-042-14, Anschluss sudetendeutscher Gebiete.jpg|right|thumb|280px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps|Sudeten German Freikorps]]]]\nThe Sudeten German nationalists, particularly the Nazis, expanded their activities after the Depression started. On 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed chancellor of Germany. The Czechoslovak government prepared to suppress the Sudeten Nazi Party. In the autumn of 1933, the Sudeten Nazis dissolved their organization, and the German Nationals were pressured to do likewise. The government expelled German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis from local government positions. The Sudeten German population was indignant, especially in nationalist strongholds like [[Egerland]].\n\nOn 1 October 1933, [[Konrad Henlein]] with his deputy, [[Karl Hermann Frank]], aided by other members of the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', a youth organization of mystical orientation, created a new political organisation. The [[Sudeten German Home Front]] (''Sudetendeutsche Heimatfront'') professed loyalty to Czechoslovakia but championed decentralization. It absorbed most former German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis.\n\nIn 1935, the Sudeten German Home Front became the [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'') (SdP) and embarked on an active propaganda campaign. In the May election, the SdP won more than 60% of the Sudeten German vote. The German Agrarians, Christian Socialists and Social Democrats each lost approximately half of their followers. The SdP became the centre of German nationalist forces. The party represented itself as striving for a just settlement of Sudeten German claims within the framework of Czechoslovak democracy.  Henlein, however, maintained secret contact with [[Nazi Germany]] and received material aid from [[Berlin]], which told him to refuse every concession offered by Czechoslovakia. The SdP endorsed the idea of a ''F\u00fchrer'' and mimicked Nazi methods with banners, slogans and uniformed troops. Concessions offered by the Czechoslovak government, including the installation of exclusively Sudeten German officials in Sudeten German areas and the possible participation of the SdP in the cabinet, were rejected.  By 1937, most SdP leaders supported Hitler's pan-German objectives.\n\nOn 13 March 1938, the [[Third Reich]] annexed [[Austria]] during the ''[[Anschluss]]''.  Immediately, many Sudeten Germans supported Henlein. On 22 March, the German Agrarian Party, led by [[Gustav Hacker]], merged with the SdP. [[German Christian Social People\u2019s Party|German Christian Socialists]] in Czechoslovakia suspended their activities on 24 March; their deputies and senators entered the SdP parliamentary club. Although the Social Democrats continued to champion democratic freedoms, the masses supported the SdP.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies (1920\u20131935)===\nThe table below shows the number of seats German parties and German\u2013Hungarian lists gained in the Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies between 1920 and 1935.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Party or List<ref>[http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/sudeten.html \"Prager Tagblatt\", Nr. 116 du 18 Mai 1935, ''Tschechoslowakische Parlamentswahl'' vom 19. 5. 1935]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/T80IHC,1,0,Republik_unter_Druck.html|title=Republik unter Druck - bpb|first=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr politische|last=Bildung|date=|website=www.bpb.de|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n!Seats 1920\n!Seats 1925\n!Seats 1929\n!Seats 1935\n!Votes 1935\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sudeten German Party]]\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|44\n|1.256.010\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German National Party]]\n| -\n|10\n|7\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sudeten German National Socialist Party|German National Socialist Workers Party]]\n|15\n|17\n|8\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic|German Social Democratic Workers Party]]\n|31\n|17\n|21\n|11\n|300.406\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[German Christian Social People's Party]]\n|7\n|13\n|14\n|6\n|163.666\n|- align=\"center\"\n|German Union of Farmers\n|11\n|24\n| -\n|5\n|142.775\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Hungarian Parties and Sudeten German Electoral Bloc\n|9\n|4\n|9\n|9\n|292.847\n|- align=\"center\"\n|United German Parties\n|6\n| -\n|16\n| -\n| -\n|- align=\"center\"\n|'''Total (out of 300 seats)'''\n|79\n|85\n|75\n|75\n|\n|}\n\n* <small>Hungarian Parties and Sudeten German Electoral Bloc (1935): German Democratic Liberal Party, German Industrialist Party, Party of German Nation, Sudeten German Land Union, German Workers Party, Zips German Party, Provincial Christian Social Party, Hungarian National Party<ref>[http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/sudeten.html \"Prager Tagblatt\", Nr. 116, May 18, 1935, ''Tschechoslowakische Parlamentswahl'' vom 19. 5. 1935]</ref></small>\n\n==Munich Agreements==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H12751, Godesberg, Vorbereitung M\u00fcnchener Abkommen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Unsmiling, [[Neville Chamberlain]] (left) and [[Adolf Hitler]] leave the Bad Godesberg meeting on 23 September 1938.]]\n[[File:Konrad Henlein v Karlov\u00fdch Varech 1937.jpg|thumb|right|Henlein speaking in [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]], 1937]]\n[[File:Teroristick\u00e1 akce sudeton\u011bmeck\u00e9ho Freikorpsu.jpg|thumb|right|A 1938 terrorist action of [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps|Sudeten German Voluntary Force]]]]\n[[Image:SN zamaz\u00e1vaj\u00ed \u010desk\u00fd n\u00e1zev \u0160umperk.gif|250px|thumb|right|In [[\u0160umperk|\u0160umperk-M\u00e4hrisch Sch\u00f6nberg]], Czech names were erased by the Sudeten Germans after the German annexation of [[Sudetenland]] in 1938.]]\n[[Konrad Henlein]] met with Hitler in Berlin on 28 March 1938 and was tolf to raise demands that would be unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. In the Carlsbad Decrees, issued on 24 April, the SdP demanded complete autonomy for the Sudetenland and freedom to profess Nazi ideology. If Henlein's demands had been granted, the Sudetenland would have been in a position to align itself with Nazi Germany.\n\nAs the political situation worsened, the security in Sudetenland deteriorated. The region became the site of small-scale clashes between young SdP followers,equipped with arms smuggled from Germany, and police and border forces. In some places, the regular army was called in to pacify the situation. Nazi propaganda accused the Czech government and Czechs of atrocities on innocent Germans. The Czechoslovaki public started to prepare for an inevitable war such as by training with gas masks.\n\nOn 20 May, Czechoslovakia initiated a so-called \"partial mobilization\" (literally \"special military precaution\") in response to rumours of German troop movements. The army moved into position on the border. Western powers tried to calm down the situation and forced Czechoslovakia to comply with most of the Carlsbad Decrees. However the SdP, instructed to continue to push towards war, escalated the situation with more protests and violence.\n\nWith the help of special Nazi forces, the ''Sudetendeutsche Freikorps'' (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-instructors) took over some border areas and committed many crimes: they killed more than 110 Czechoslovaks (mostly soldiers and policemen) and kidnapped over 2,020 Czechoslovak citizens (including German antifascists), taking them to [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=zimmermann>Zimmermann, Volker: 'Die Sudetendeutschen im NS-Staat.

I believe these complaints to be in the main justified. Even as late as the time of my Mission, I could find no readiness on the part of the Czechoslovak Government to remedy them on anything like an adequate scale... the feeling among the Sudeten Germans until about three or four years ago was one of hopelessness. But the rise of Nazi Germany gave them new hope. I regard their turning for help towards their kinsmen and their eventual desire to join the Reich as a natural development in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n\nBritain and France then pressured the Czechoslovak government into ceding the Sudetenland to Germany on 21 September. The [[Munich Agreement]], signed September 29 by Britain, France, Germany and Italy and negotiated without Czechoslovak participation, only confirmed that decision and the negotiated details. Czechoslovakia ceded a German-defined maximalist extension of Sudetenland to Germany, including the [[\u0160koda Works]]; near [[Pilsen]], they had been Czechoslovakia's primary armaments factory.\n\nAs a result, Bohemia and Moravia lost about 38 percent of their combined area, and 3.65&nbsp;million inhabitants (2.82&nbsp;million Germans<ref name=\"bruntal.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bruntal.net/2007072602-k-otazce-vysidleni-obcanu-csr-ze-sudet-tesinska-podkarpatske-rusi-a-slovenske-republiky-v-letech-1938-1939 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141202131759/http://www.bruntal.net/2007072602-k-otazce-vysidleni-obcanu-csr-ze-sudet-tesinska-podkarpatske-rusi-a-slovenske-republiky-v-letech-1938-1939 |archive-date=2014-12-02 |df= }}</ref> and approximately 513,000 - 750,000<ref name=\"bruntal.net\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bohumildolezal.cz/texty/u074-08.htm|title=Fakta o vyhn\u00e1n\u00ed \u010cech\u016f ze Sudet|first=Bohumil|last=Dole\u017eal|date=|website=www.bohumildolezal.cz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Czechs to Germany).\n\n==Under Nazi rule==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H13160, Beim Einmarsch deutscher Truppen in Eger.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Sudeten Germans greeting Hitler with the [[Nazi salute]] after he crossed the border into Czechoslovakia in 1938.]]\n\nSome 250,000 Germans remained on the Czech side of the border, which later became part of the Reich by the establishment of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] under German governors and the German Army.

About half a million Sudeten Germans joined the [[Nazi Party]], which amounted to 17.34% of the German population in the Sudetenland (the average in [[Nazi Germany]] was 7.85%). Because of their knowledge of the [[Czech language]], many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] as well as in the Nazi oppressive machinery such as the [[Gestapo]]. The most notable was [[Karl Hermann Frank]], the SS and Police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], German men in Slovakia usually served in the Slovak army, but more than 7,000 were members of paramilitary squads (''Freiwillige Schutzstaffeln'') and almost 2,000 volunteers joined the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.  After the beginning of the [[Slovak National uprising]] in late 1944, most of the young Germans in Slovakia were drafted in the German army, either with the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS. The very young and elderly were organized in ''Heimatschutz'', an equivalent of the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' in Germany.  The Nazis ordered some of them to take action against the partisans; others participated in deportation of Slovak Jews.<ref>Littlejohn, David: ''Foreign Legions of the Third Reich''. 1994</ref>  The Nazis evacuated about 120,000 Germans (mostly women and children) to the [[Sudetenland]] and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]].<ref name=\"zimmermann\"/>\n\n==Expulsion and transfer==\n{{Main|Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia}}\n[[File:Vertreibung.jpg|thumb|Germans expelled from Bohemia and Moravia after the Second World War]]\nIn the aftermath of World War II, when the Czechoslovak state was restored, the government expelled the majority of ethnic Germans (about 3 million altogether), in the belief that their behaviour had been a major cause of the war and subsequent destruction. In the months directly following the end of the war, \"wild\" expulsions happened from May until August 1945. Several Czechoslovak statesmen encouraged such expulsions with polemical speeches. Generally local authorities ordered the expulsions, which armed volunteers carried out.  In some cases the regular army initiated or assisted such expulsions.<ref>Biman, S. - C\u00edlek, R.: ''Posledn\u00ed mrtv\u00ed, prvn\u00ed \u017eiv\u00ed''. \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem 1989.

An estimated 1.6&nbsp;million \"ethnic Germans\" (most of them also had Czech ancestors; and even Czechs, who spoke mainly German over the last years), were deported from Czechoslovakia to the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American zone]] of what would become [[West Germany]].

This sequence was largely normal-polarity dominated, and presented two potential Norian-Rhaetian boundaries (since the defining biostratigraphy of the Rhaetian was not resolved at the time). Defining the boundary based on the appearance of ''[[Misikella|Misikella posthernsteini]]'' placed it in a reverse-polarity section (B-) near the base of Oyuklu.

The inferred overlap between these reverse-polarity sections was located above a normal-polarity section (A+ in Oyuklu and PM11n in Pizzo Mondello). This underlying normal-polarity section was correlated with either magnetozone E21n or E23n of the Newark sequence. Although the upper portion of Oyuklu was mostly normal, it did have a few reverse sections (H- and J-) which were at odds with the almost entirely-normal last few Triassic magnetozones of Newark.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nGallet ''et al.'' (2007) explained this by suggesting that there was a missing period of time or \"hiatus\" at the end of the Newark sequence, which would have resembled part of Oyuklu had it not been eroded away. If the base of Oyuklu (A+) was equivalent to E21n, then the upper half of Oyuklu would be equivalent to the Newark \"hiatus\", B- was equivalent to E21r, and G+ was equivalent to E23n. If A+ was instead equivalent to E23n, then practically all of Oyuklu (B- and up) would represent the hiatus. Estimating the duration of Oyuklu by comparing Pizzo Mondello with equivalent sections of Newark led Gallet ''et al''. (2007) to the conclusion that the Rhaetian lasted only 2 million years (if the boundary was at G+) or 4.5 million years (if it was at B-).<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nSome biostratigraphic studies have also supported a hiatus at Newark. The [[Clam shrimp|conchostracan]] ''[[Shipingia|Shipingia olseni]],'' which in Europe is found in Norian rocks, occurs in the upper portion of the [[Passaic Formation]], the last pre-[[Central Atlantic magmatic province|CAMP]] section of the Newark basin.

In Brumano, ''M. posthernsteini'' first appeared quite a distance below the oldest reported magnetozone, BIT1n, which was correlated with E20n at Newark. The opposite is true in Pizzo Mondello, where ''M. posthersteini'' appears above the youngest complete magnetozone, PM12n (equivalent to E17n at Newark). This suggests that the Norian-Rhaetian boundary lies in the range of Newark magnetozones E17r to E19r, or 207-210 Ma.

The most consistent and regular of these cycles are 405,000-year cycles known as McLaughlin cycles. By tracing McLaughlin cycles backwards from the radiometrically-dated CAMP basalts, the boundaries between each formation and magnetozone in the Newark sequence could be assigned a precise age. Magnetozone E20r.2r lasted from 206.03 to 204.65 Ma according to this method, suggesting that the Rhaetian began ~205.5 Ma.

The inferred overlap between these reverse-polarity sections was located above a normal-polarity section (A+ in Oyuklu and PM11n in Pizzo Mondello). This underlying normal-polarity section was correlated with either magnetozone E21n or E23n of the Newark sequence.

If the base of Oyuklu (A+) was equivalent to E21n, then the upper half of Oyuklu would be equivalent to the Newark \"hiatus\", B- was equivalent to E21r, and G+ was equivalent to E23n. If A+ was instead equivalent to E23n, then practically all of Oyuklu (B- and up) would represent the hiatus. Estimating the duration of Oyuklu by comparing Pizzo Mondello with equivalent sections of Newark led Gallet ''et al''.

Maron ''et al.'' (2015) elaborated on the dating of an upcoming GSSP candidate for the Rhaetian in the form of the [[Pignola-Abriola section]] in Southern Italy. This section recorded the Norian-Rhaetian boundary as tracked by the first occurence of ''Misikella posthernsteini'', the base of the ''[[Proparvicingula moniliformis]]'' [[Radiolaria|radiolarian]] zone, and a prominent negative [[\u039413C|''\u03b4''<sup>13</sup>C]] anomaly. [[Magnetostratigraphy]] correlated MPA5r (the Pignola-Abriola magnetozone surrounding the Norian-Rhaetian boundary) with the early part of Newark's E20. This provided an estimated date of 205.7 Ma for the Norian-Rhaetian boundary, very similar to Wotzlaw ''et al.'' (2014)'s estimate.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nSome controversy over the date of the Norian-Rhaetian boundary has resulted from differing interpretations of the conodont used to define it, ''Misikella posthernsteini''. Paleontologists working on the Pignola-Abriola GSSP candidate have argued that the early ''M. posthernsteini'' specimens present at Steinbergkogel are actually an older transitional form (''M. posthernsteini'' sensu lato) which lies between ''M. hernsteini'' and ''M. posthernsteini'' in the evolution of Triassic conodonts. The Pignola-Abriola form (''M. posthernsteini'' sensu stricto) is considered morphologically more similar to the original fossils of the species, described from [[Slovakia]] in 1974.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Bertinelli, A.; Casacci, M.; Concheri, G.; Gattolin, G.; Godfrey, L.; Katz, M.E.; Maron|first=M.; Mazza, M.; Mietto, P.; Muttoni, G.; Rigo, M.; Sprovieri, M.; Stellin, F.; & Zaffani, M.|date=April 2016|title=The Norian/Rhaetian boundary interval at Pignola-Abriola section (southern Apennines, Italy) as a GSSP candidate for the Rhaetian stage: an update|url=http://paleo.cortland.edu/Albertiana/issues/43/Albertiana_43sm.pdf#page=7|journal=Albertiana|volume=43|pages=5-18|via=}}</ref> This debate has led some biostratigraphers to suggest avoiding the use of conodonts in Triassic [[chronostratigraphy]] altogether,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Spencer G.|date=April 2016|title=Base of the Rhaetian and a critique of Triassic conodont-based chronostratigraphy|url=http://paleo.cortland.edu/Albertiana/issues/43/Albertiana_43sm.pdf#page=26|journal=Albertiana|volume=43|pages=24-27|via=}}</ref> a proposal which itself has been criticized by Triassic conodont specialists.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orchard|first=Michael J.|date=April 2016|title=Base of the Rhaetian and a critique of Triassic conodont-based chronostratigraphy: comment|url=http://paleo.cortland.edu/Albertiana/issues/43/Albertiana_43sm.pdf#page=30|journal=Albertiana|volume=43|pages=28-32|via=}}</ref> Writing on behalf of the ICS, Ogg (2016) stated that there were two possible dates for the Norian-Rhaetian boundary: 209.5 Ma (using ''M. posthernsteini'' sensu lato and Steinbergkogel as a GSSP) or 205.8 Ma (using ''M. posthernsteini'' sensu stricto and Pignola-Abriola as a GSSP).<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Ogg|first=James G.|title=A Concise Geologic Time Scale|last2=Ogg|first2=Gabi M.|last3=Gradstein|first3=Felix M.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=133-149|chapter=Triassic|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-59467-9.00011-X}}</ref>\n\nA recent update of Newark stratigraphy by Kent, Olsen, & Muttoni (2017) combined magnetostratigraphy with [[astrochronology]] to form the longest astrochronostratigraphic polarity time scale (APTS) known in the fossil record. The Newark sequence was affected by astrochronological ([[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch]]) cycles as recorded by climate-induced changes in lake depth and geology, although depositional rate is remarkably consistent within the Newark basin. The most consistent and regular of these cycles are 405,000-year cycles known as McLaughlin cycles. By tracing McLaughlin cycles backwards from the radiometrically-dated CAMP basalts, the boundaries between each formation and magnetozone in the Newark sequence could be assigned a precise age. Magnetozone E20r.2r lasted from 206.03 to 204.65 Ma according to this method, suggesting that the Rhaetian began ~205.5 Ma. This agrees with the dates for the Norian-Rhaetian boundary obtained by Wotzlaw ''et al.'' (2014) and Maron ''et al.'' (2015).<ref name=\":1\" /> The accuracy of the Newark APTS has been supported by Li ''et al.'' (2017), who found astrochronological and magnetostratigraphic signatures in the [[Xujiahe Formation]] of China practically identical to those of the Newark sequence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Mingsong|last2=Zhang|first2=Yang|last3=Huang|first3=Chunju|last4=Ogg|first4=James|last5=Hinnov|first5=Linda|last6=Wang|first6=Yongdong|last7=Zou|first7=Zhuoyan|last8=Li|first8=Liqin|date=2017-10-01|title=Astronomical tuning and magnetostratigraphy of the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation of South China and Newark Supergroup of North America: Implications for the Late Triassic time scale|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318641999|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=475|pages=207\u2013223|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2017.07.015|issn=0012-821X|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Rhaetian-Hettangian boundary ===\nThe end date of the Rhaetian currently in use by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] (201.3 \u00b10.2 Ma) is based on a study by Schoene ''et al''. (2010) involving [[Ammonoidea|ammonite]]-bearing strata in [[Peru]]. They used [[Thermal ionization mass spectrometry|CA-ID-TIMS]] [[Uranium\u2013lead dating|Uranium-Lead dating]] to date ash beds slightly below and slightly above the first appearance of ''[[Psiloceras]]'' in the [[Pucar\u00e1 Basin]]. The overlying ash bed was dated to 201.29 \u00b10.16 Ma while the underlying was 201.36 \u00b10.13 Ma. This allowed the first appearance of ''Psiloceras'' to be given a date of 201.31 \u00b10.18/0.43 Ma (assuming minimum/maximum uncertainty).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBlackburn ''et al''. (2013) instead estimated a slightly older end date. They used a combination of radiometric dates and [[astrochronology]] (via Triassic [[Milankovitch cycles]]) to constrain the [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event|end-Triassic extinction]] to 201.564 \u00b10.015/0.22 Ma. The biostratigraphically-defined Triassic-Jurassic (Rhaetian-Hettangian) boundary is considered to lie approximately 60-140 thousand years after the extinction by most sources, and therefore the Rhaetian ended in the range of 201.5 to 201.4 Ma under the methodology of Blackburn ''et al''.

En route, ''Art\u00e9sien'', which had originally been appointed to a shorter mission, found herself short on water, and Captain de Cardaillac requested permission to resupply at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]]. Suffren gave permission but, unwilling to scatter his forces, ordered his entire squadron to move into [[Praia Harbor|Praia Harbour]]. Arriving there at 0830 the morning of 16 April, ''Art\u00e9sien'' spotted five British warship at anchor; she turned, signalling \"enemy ships in sight\".

He had 11 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 corvettes at his disposal. En route, d'Orves changed his objectif from [[Trincomalee]] to [[Madras]].<ref name=cunat97>Cunat, p.97</ref><ref group=Note>Present-day [[Chennai]]</ref> On 19 January, ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' detected a strange sail, and d'Orves detached ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'' to investigate. Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'', ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender. She was the 50-gun [[HMS Hannibal (1779)|HMS ''Hannibal'']], under Captain Christy.<ref name=cunat99>Cunat, p.99</ref> \n\nIn the following days, d'Orves' failing health deteriorated to the point where he was not fit for duty, and he delegated command to Suffren.<ref name=cunat100>Cunat, p.100</ref> The French intended to surprise the British ships anchored in the roads of Madras. The fleet arrived North of Madras on 5 February 1782, and its light units started praying on coastal merchantmen and capturing cargo of rice.<ref name=cunat101>Cunat, p.101</ref> However, the [[monsoon]] caused strong winds from the South which trapped the French North of Madras, while at the same time favouring the return of Hughes' squadron from Ceylon to Madras.<ref name=cunat102>Cunat, p.102</ref> Upon Hughes' arrival, [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]] warned him of the presence of the French squadron, and Hughes anchored his ships under the protection of [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] and [[George Town, Chennai|Black Town]]. On 9 February 1782, Hughes received reinforcements with the arrival of a squadron comprising the 64-gun [[HMS Monmouth (1772)|HMS ''Monmouth'']], the [[74-gun]] [[HMS Hero (1759)|''Hero'']], the 50-gun [[HMS Isis (1774)|''Isis'']] and the armed transport ''Manilla'', under [[James Alms]]. \n\nD'Orves died the same day at 1600. Suffren re-appointed his captains to the ships of the squadon: Captain de Lapalli\u00e8re{{refn|Sometimes spelt \"la Palli\u00e8re\"<ref name=cunat104 />|group=Note}} took command of ''Orient'' and Cillart that of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re''; Captain [[Justin Bonaventure Morard de Galles|Morard de Galles]], of ''Pourvoyeuse'', and Lieutenant de Ruyter, in temporary command of ''Petit Annibal'', exchanged their positions; Beaulieu went on ''Bellone'';<ref name=cunat103>Cunat, p.103</ref>  Tromelin (the Younger) took on ''Subtile''; and Galifet took ''Sylphide''. General Duchemin transfered from ''Orient'' to ''H\u00e9ros''.<ref name=cunat104>Cunat, p.104</ref>\n\nOn 14, usual monsoon wind from the North-East resumed, allowing Suffren's squadron to sail South. In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref>\n\n\n[[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

En route, ''Art\u00e9sien'', which had originally been appointed to a shorter mission, found herself short on water, and Captain de Cardaillac requested permission to resupply at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]]. Suffren gave permission but, unwilling to scatter his forces, ordered his entire squadron to move into [[Praia Harbor|Praia Harbour]]. Arriving there at 0830 the morning of 16 April, ''Art\u00e9sien'' spotted five British warship at anchor; she turned, signalling \"enemy ships in sight\".

He had 11 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 corvettes at his disposal. En route, d'Orves changed his objectif from [[Trincomalee]] to [[Madras]].<ref name=cunat97>Cunat, p.97</ref><ref group=Note>Present-day [[Chennai]]</ref> On 19 January, ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' detected a strange sail, and d'Orves detached ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'' to investigate. Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'', ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender. She was the 50-gun [[HMS Hannibal (1779)|HMS ''Hannibal'']], under Captain Christy.<ref name=cunat99>Cunat, p.99</ref> \n\nIn the following days, d'Orves' failing health deteriorated to the point where he was not fit for duty, and he delegated command to Suffren.<ref name=cunat100>Cunat, p.100</ref> The French intended to surprise the British ships anchored in the roads of Madras.

On 9 February 1782, Hughes received reinforcements with the arrival of a squadron comprising the 64-gun [[HMS Monmouth (1772)|HMS ''Monmouth'']], the [[74-gun]] [[HMS Hero (1759)|''Hero'']], the 50-gun [[HMS Isis (1774)|''Isis'']] and the armed transport ''Manilla'', under [[James Alms]]. \n\nD'Orves died the same day at 1600. Suffren re-appointed his captains to the ships of the squadon: Captain de Lapalli\u00e8re{{refn|Sometimes spelt \"la Palli\u00e8re\"<ref name=cunat104 />|group=Note}} took command of ''Orient'' and Cillart that of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re''; Captain [[Justin Bonaventure Morard de Galles|Morard de Galles]], of ''Pourvoyeuse'', and Lieutenant de Ruyter, in temporary command of ''Petit Annibal'', exchanged their positions; Beaulieu went on ''Bellone'';<ref name=cunat103>Cunat, p.103</ref>  Tromelin (the Younger) took on ''Subtile''; and Galifet took ''Sylphide''. General Duchemin transfered from ''Orient'' to ''H\u00e9ros''.<ref name=cunat104>Cunat, p.104</ref>\n\nOn 14, usual monsoon wind from the North-East resumed, allowing Suffren's squadron to sail South. In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref>\n\n\n[[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

{"title_page": "Ostrogoths", "text_new": "[[File:Tomb of Theodoric the Great Ravenna (cropped).jpg|thumb|Upright=1.1|The [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]] in [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]]]]\nThe '''Ostrogoths''' ({{lang-la|Ostrogothi, Austrogothi}}) were a [[Roman-era]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic people]]. In the 5th century, they followed the [[Visigoths]] in creating one of the two great [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdoms within the [[Roman Empire]], based upon the large Gothic populations who had settled in the [[Balkans]] in the 4th century, having crossed the [[Lower Danube]]. While the Visigoths had formed under the leadership of [[Alaric I]], the new Ostrogothic political entity which came to rule Italy, was formed in the Balkans under the influence of the [[Amal Dynasty]]\n\nAfter the death of [[Attila]] and collapse of the [[Hunnic empire]] represented by the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 453, the [[Amal Dynasty]], the family of [[Theodoric the Great]], began to form their kingdom in [[Pannonia]]. [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] played these Pannonian Goths off against the [[Thracian Goths]], but instead the two groups united after the death of the Thracian leader [[Theoderic Strabo]] and his son Recitach. Zeno then backed Theodoric to invade Italy and replace [[Odoacer]], who he had previously supported as its king. In 493 Theodoric the Great established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of [[Italy]], when he defeated Odoacer's forces, and killed his rival at a banquet. \n\nA period of instability then ensued, eventually tempting the [[Byzantine|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Justinian]] to declare war on the Ostrogoths in 535, in an effort to restore the former western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. Initially, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] were successful, but under the leadership of [[Totila]], the [[Goths]] reconquered most of the lost territory until Totila's death at the [[Battle of Taginae]]. [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|The war]] lasted for almost 21 years and caused enormous damage across Italy, reducing the population of the peninsula. Any remaining Ostrogoths in Italy were absorbed into the [[Lombards]], who established a [[Lombard Kingdom|kingdom]] in Italy in 568.\n\nAs with other Gothic groups, the history of the peoples who made them up before they reached the Roman Balkans is difficult to reconstruct in detail. However, the Ostrogoths are associated with the earlier [[Greuthungi]]. The Ostrogoths themselves were more commonly referred to simply as Goths even in the 5th century, but before then they were referred to once, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which associates them with a group of Greuthungi, settled as a military unit in [[Phrygia]]. Furthermore, the 6th century historian of the Goths Jordanes also equated the Ostrogoths of his time to the Goths ruled by King [[Ermanaric]] in the 4th century, who the Roman writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] had called Greuthungi, and described as living between the [[Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers. [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] attacked the Goths from the east and large groups of Goths moved into the Roman empire, while others became subservient to the Huns.\n\n==Goths==\n{{Main article|Goths|Chernyakhov culture|Oium|Gothic runic inscriptions}}\n[[File:Chernyakhov.PNG|thumb|{{legend|#0f0|Traditional [[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|Island of [[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark Culture]], early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]], early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\nThe Ostrogoths were one of several peoples referred to more generally as Goths. The Goths appear in Roman records starting in the third century, in the regions north of the [[Lower Danube]] and [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=109\u2013110}} They competed for influence with peoples who had lived longer in the area, such as the [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]], and various [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=116,127\u2013128}} Based on their Germanic language and material culture it is believed that the Gothic culture derived from cultures originally from the direction of the [[Vistula]] river, in the north, and now in [[Poland]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=115\u2013117}} By the third century, the Goths were already in sub-groups with their own names, because the [[Tervingi]], who bordered on the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Carpathian mountains]], were mentioned separately on at least one occasion.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths, not mentioned until later, are associated with the Greuthungi who lived further east. The dividing line between the Tervingi and the Greuthungi, was reported by Ammianus to be the [[Dniester River]], and to the east of the Greuthungi were [[Alans]] living near the River Don.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=151\u2013153}}\n\n===Gothic Language===\n{{Main|Gothic language}}\nThe Ostrogoths in Italy used the Gothic language, which is best attested today in the surviving translation of the Bible by the Visigothic bishop [[Ulfilas]]. While none of the eastern Germanic languages are still spoken, Gothic is the only one with \"continuous texts\" remaining. These comprise the earliest remnants of a [[Germanic language]].{{efn|A language related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] was still spoken sporadically in [[Crimea]] as late as the 16th and 17th centuries ([[Crimean Gothic language]]).{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Much of the disappearance of the Gothic language is attributable to the Goths' cultural and linguistic absorption by other European peoples during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=572}} }}\n\n===Etymology===\n{{see|Greuthungi#Etymology|Goths#Name}}\n[[File:GNM - Gotische Fibeln.jpg|thumb|right|Ostrogothic bow-fibulae (c. 500) from [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Italy]]]]\n\nThe first part of the word \"Ostrogoth\" comes from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root \"*auster-\" meaning eastern. According to the proposal of Wolfram, this was originally a boastful tribal name meaning \"Goths of the rising sun\", or \"Goths glorified by the rising sun\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=25, 387 fn49, 388 fn58}}{{Efn|Wolfram cites Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld's (1911) work, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und V\u00f6lkernamen'' as his principle naming source. See: [https://archive.org/details/wrterbuchderaltg00schn/page/39 p.39].}} By the 6th century, however, Jordanes, for example, believed that the Visigoths and Ostrogoths were two contrasting names simply meaning western and eastern Goths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=206}}\n\n==History==\n\n===The Greuthungi and Ostrogothi before the Huns===\n{{Further|Greuthungi}}\nThe nature of the divisions of the Goths before the arrival of the Huns is uncertain, but the Ostrogoths are only mentioned by that name very rarely and normally in very uncertain contexts. Among other Gothic group names however, they are associated with the Greuthungi. Scholarly opinions are various. Historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] sees these as two names for one people as will be discussed below. [[Peter Heather]], in contrast, has written that: \n<blockquote>Ostrogoths in the sense of the group led by Theodoric to Italy stand at the end of complex processes of fragmentation and unification involving a variety of groups - mostly but not solely Gothic it seems - and the better, more contemporary, evidence argues against the implication derived from Jordanes that Ostrogoths are Greuthungi by another name.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=404}}</blockquote>\n\nSome historians go much further than Heather, questioning whether we can assume any single ethnicity, even Gothic, which united the Ostrogoths before they were politically united by the Amal clan.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Heather|2007}} explains Heather's position in contrast to those of {{harvtxt|Amory|1997}}. Also see {{harvtxt|Kulikowski|2002}}.}}\n\nOne dubious early mention of the Ostrogoths is found in the much later-written ''Historia Augusta''. In the article for Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] (reigned 268\u2013270), the following list of \"[[Scythian]]\" peoples is given who had been conquered by the emperor when he earned his title \"Gothicus\": \"''peuci trutungi ''austorgoti'' uirtingi sigy pedes celtae etiam eruli''\". These words are traditionally edited by modern to include well-known peoples: \"''[[Peuci]], Grutungi, ''Austrogoti'', Tervingi, Visi, Gipedes, [[Celts|Celtae]] etiam et [[Heruli|Eruli]]''\" (emphasis added). However this work is not considered reliable, especially for contemporary terminology.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=201\u2013205}}\n\nThe first record of a Gothic sub-group acting in its own name, specifically the [[Tervingi]], was dated from 291.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24, fn52}}<ref>''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' XI 17.1 (dated 291)</ref> The [[Greuthungi]], [[Vesi]], and Ostrogothi are all attested no earlier than 388.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} \n\nThe Ostrogoths were first definitely mentioned more than one hundred years later than the Tervingi in 399, and this is the only certain mention of this name at all before the Amals created their kingdom of Italy. A poem by [[Claudian]] describes Ostrogoths who are mixed with Greuthungi and settled in [[Phrygia]] together as a disgruntled barbarian military force, who had once fought against Rome, but were now supposed to fight for it. Claudian only uses the term Ostrogoth once, but in other references to this same group he more often calls them Greuthungi or \"[[Getae|Getic]]\" (an older word used for Goths generally in this period). These Goths came to be led into rebellion by [[Tribigild]], a Roman general of Gothic background. Much later [[Zosimus]] also described Tribigild and his rebellion against the eunuch consul Eutropius. [[Gainas]], the aggrieved Gothic general sent to fight Tribigild, openly joined forces with him after the death of Eutropius. Zosimus believed that was conspiracy between the two Goths from the beginning.{{efn|Claudian, ''Against Eutropius'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/In_Eutropium/2*.html#141A 2.141]; Zosimus, ''New History'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth Book 5].

Note Wolfram describes this as a poem to 392, though as Christensen and Cameron et al. note, it was written after the death of [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius the consul]] (died 399). On the dating of Claudian's poem see {{harvtxt|Long|1996|loc=ch.5}}.}} It is generally believed by historians that this Phrygian settlement of Greuthingi, referred to as including Ostrogoths, were part of the Greuthungi-led force led by [[Odotheus]] in 386, and not the Greuthungi who had entered the empire earlier, in 376 under [[Alatheus and Saphrax]].{{sfn|Heather|1988|p=156}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=214}} \n\nBased upon the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], whose ''[[Getica]]'' is a history of the Ostrogothic Amal dynasty, there is a tradition of simply equating the [[Greuthungi]] with the Ostrogothi.{{sfn|Heather|1996|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Jordanes does not mention the Greuthungi, but he identified the Ostrogothic kings, the [[Amal dynasty]], including [[Theodoric the Great]], as the heirs and descendants of king [[Ermanaric]]. Ermanaric was described by the more reliable contemporary writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] as a king of the Greuthungi, however the family succession described by the two classical authors is completely in conflict, and Ammianus is considered to be the more reliable source.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|pp=141\u2013157}} summarizes the field's position: \"There has never been any doubt that of these two conflicting accounts, the one by Ammianus Marcellinus was to be preferred\". Christensen especially cites {{harvtxt|Heather|1989}}.}} Jordanes also specified that around 250 (the time of Emperor [[Philip the Arab]] who reigned 244\u2013249) the Ostrogoths were ruled by a king called [[Ostrogotha]] and they either derived their name from this \"father of the Ostrogoths\", or else the Ostrogoths and Visigoths got these names because they meant eastern and western Goths.{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|pp=87\u201388 [XXIV.130\u2013XXV.131]}}\n\nModern historians agree that Jordanes is unreliable, but some historians such as Herwig Wolfram defend the equation of the Greuthungi and Ostrogoths. Wolfram follows the position of [[Franz Altheim]] that the terms Tervingi and Greuthungi were older geographical identifiers used by outsiders to describe these Visigoths and Ostrogoths before they crossed the Danube, and that this terminology dropped out of use after about 400, when many Goths had moved into the Roman empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}} In contrast, according to him, the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples themselves to boastfully describe themselves, and thus remained in use. In support of this, Wolfram argues that it is significant that Roman writers either used terminology contrasting Tervingi and Greuthungi, or Vesi/Visigoths and Ostrogoths, and never mixed these pairs \u2014 for example they never contrasted Tervingi and Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} There are two examples of Roman texts which mix Wolfram's proposed geographical and boastful terminologies, but neither contrasts (supposedly) geographical and boastful terms. First, as mentioned above, Ostrogoths and Greuthungi were mentioned together by the poet Claudian, and secondly, all four names were used together in the unreliable ''[[Augustan History]]'' for the Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] which has \"''Gruthungi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi''\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=202\u2013203}} As a second argument for this geographical versus boastful contrast, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to the group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] after 376 who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians, arguing that these \"can only\" be Thervingi, and that this shows how the name \"Greuthungi\" was only used by outsiders.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} However, as mentioned above, these Greuthungi mentioned by Zosimus are those who Heather and other historians equate to the rebellious Greuthungi mentioned later by Claudian in Phrygia in 399\u2013400, who were, according to Claudian, mixed with Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Heather|1988|p=156}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=214}} \n\nIn any case, the older terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after they entered the Roman Empire. The term \"Visigoth\" was an invention of the sixth century. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term ''Visigothi'' to match ''Ostrogothi'', which terms he thought of as \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western-eastern division was a simplification and a literary device of sixth-century historians where political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Furthermore, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gallo-Hispanic Goths]]. This usage, however, was adopted by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was in use in the seventh century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nOther names for the Goths abounded. A \"Germanic\" Byzantine or Italian author referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Valagothi'', meaning \"Roman [''[[walha]]''] Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} In 484 the Ostrogoths had been called the ''Valameriaci'' (men of Valamir) because they followed Theodoric, a descendant of Valamir.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} This terminology survived in the Byzantine East as late as the reign of [[Athalaric]], who was called ''\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5'' (''tou Oualemeriakou'') by [[John Malalas]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=389, fn67}}\n\n===Hunnic invasions and the Amals===\n{{Main|History of the Huns}}\nIn the late 4th century, the rise of the [[Huns]] forced many of the Goths and Alans to join them, while others moved westwards and eventually moved into Roman territory in the [[Balkans]]. Ostrogoths and Greuthungi, perhaps the same people, are believed to have been among the first Goths who were subdued by the Huns.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=55}} Many Greuthungi entered the Roman Empire in 376 with [[Saphrax and Alatheus]], and many of these Goths probably subsequently joined Alaric, contributing to the formation of the [[Visigothic kingdom]]. As discussed above a group of Ostrogoths and Greuthungi were apparently also settled in Phrygia in the 380s by the Romans. Otherwise, historical records only begin to mention the name of the Ostrogoths as the Gothic political entity which formed in the Balkans in the 5th century. \n\nThe Amal-led Ostrogothic kingdom began to coalesce around the leadership of the [[Amal dynasty]] who had fought under [[Attila]], and later settled in [[Pannonia]]. The second major component of the Amal kingdom's population were the [[Thracian Goths]]. This occurred around 483/484.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=73}}{{sfn|Heather|2003|p=90}}\n\nThe Pannonian Ostrogoths had fought alongside both Alans and Huns.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=177}} Like several other tribal peoples, they became one of the many Hunnic vassals fighting in Europe, as in the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451, where the Huns were defeated by the Roman general Aetius, accompanied by a contingent of Alans, and Visigoths.{{sfn|Kim|2013|pp=75, 77}} Jordanes' account of this battle certainly cannot be trusted as he wrongly attributes a good portion of the victory to the Goths, when it was the Alans who formed the \"backbone of Roman defences.\"{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=77}} More generally, Jordanes, depicts the Amals as an ancient royal family in his ''Getica'', making them traditionally preeminent among the Goths in the Ukraine, both before and during the empire of Attila. [[Valamir]], the uncle of Theodoric the Great, is even depicted as Attila's most highly valued leader along with [[Ardaric]] of the Gepids.{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=107 [XXXVIII.199\u2013200]}} Modern historians such as [[Peter Heather]] believe this is an exaggeration, and point out that there were at least three factions of Goths in Attila's forces.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=222}}{{sfn|Heather|2007|pp=46\u201347, 72\u201373}}\n\nThe recorded history of the Ostrogoths as a political entity thus begins with their independence from the remains of the Hunnic Empire following the death of [[Attila the Hun]] in 453. Under Valimir they were among the peoples who were living in the [[Middle Danube]] region by this time, and whose freedom from domination by Attila's sons was confirmed by the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454, which was led by the [[Gepids]]. It is unclear what role the Goths played in this battle, if any, and after the battle many Goths entered Roman military service, while only some began to coalesce under the leadership of Valamir and his two brothers, Vidimir and [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], the father of [[Theodoric the Great]].{{sfn|Burns|1984|pp=52\u201353}} \n\nThese Amal-led Goths apparently first settled in the Pannonian area of [[Lake Balaton]] and Sirmium ([[Sremska Mitrovica]]), on the Roman Danube frontier. The land they acquired between Vindobona (Vienna) and Sirmium ([[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was not well-managed, a fact which rendered the Ostrogoths dependent upon Constantinople for subsidies.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=178}} They came into conflict with other [[Middle Danube|Middle Danubian]] peoples including the Danubian [[Suebian]] kingdom of [[Hunimund]], and the [[Scirii]], who had arrived as part of the Hunnic empire, and this led to the death of Valimir, and eventual Gothic victory at the [[Battle of Bolia]] in 469, now under Theodemir. Theodemer brought these Goths into East Roman territory in 473/474.{{sfn|Heather|2003|p=86}}\n\nThe Thracian Goths, according to Peter Heather had probably become unified only in about the 460s, although they probably lived in the area since the 420s.{{sfn|Heather|2003|pp=88, 91}} They formed a military force which was loyal to [[Aspar]], the East Roman ''magister militum'' (\"master of soldiers\") of Alanic-Gothic descent, who was killed in 471. Aspar's death saw a change in the East Roman approach to Gothic military forces. Theoderic Strabo led a revolt in 473. Wolfram proposed that Theoderic Strabo was an Amal, whose father had split with Theoderic's branch on around the time of the Battle of Nadao.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=32, 260}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths followed a similar path in the Balkans to the Alaric-led Visigoths played the century before. They gained momentum by merging two large blocks of militarized Balkan peoples including many who had fought for the Roman Empire, the Pannonian and Thracian Goths; they had a difficult relationship with the Eastern Roman power; they were reinforced by smaller groups such as the [[Rugii]]; and then just as the West Goths had done before them, they passed from the East to the West.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Kingdom in Italy===\n{{History of Italy}}\n{{Main article|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Ostrogothic Kingdom.png|right|300px|thumb|Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy]]\n\nThe greatest of all Ostrogothic rulers, the future [[Theodoric the Great]] (whose Gothic name meant \"leader of the people\") of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (''Regnum Italiae'', \"Kingdom of Italy\"){{efn|See: http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cassiodorus/varia2.shtml Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, ''Variae'', Lib.

His childhood was spent at [[Constantinople]] as a diplomatic [[hostage]], where he was carefully educated.{{sfn|Backman|2008|p=68}}  The early part of his life was taken up with various disputes, intrigues and wars within the [[Byzantine empire]], in which he had as his rival [[Theodoric Strabo]] of the [[Thracian Goths]], a distant relative of Theodoric the Great and son of [[Triarius]]. This older but lesser Theodoric seems to have been the chief, not the king, of that branch of the Ostrogoths that had settled within the Empire earlier.  Theodoric the Great, as he is sometimes distinguished, was sometimes the friend, sometimes the enemy, of the Empire.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} In the former case he was clothed with various Roman titles and offices, as [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[consul]]; but in all cases alike he remained the national Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Theodoric is also known for his attainment of support from the [[Catholic Church]] and on one occasion, he even helped resolve a disputed papal election.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=338}} During his reign, Theodoric, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], allowed freedom of religion, which had not been done before. However, he did try to appease the [[Pope]] and tried to keep his alliance with the church strong. He saw the Pope as an authority not only in the church but also over Rome itself. His ability to work well with Italy's nobles, members of the Roman Senate, and the Catholic Church all helped facilitate his acceptance as the ruler of Italy.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\nTheodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and in doing so, profited the Italian people.{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=109}} It was in both characters together that he set out in 488, by commission from the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], to recover [[Italy]] from [[Odoacer]].  In 489, the [[Rugii]], a Germanic tribe who dwelt in the [[Hungarian Plain]], joined the Ostrogoths in their invasion of Italy under their leader [[Frideric]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=665}} By 493 [[Ravenna]] was taken, where Theodoric would set up his capital. It was also at this time that Odoacer was killed by Theodoric's own hand.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Ostrogothic power was fully established over Italy, [[Sicily]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and the lands to the north of Italy. Around 500, Theodoric celebrated his thirtieth anniversary as King of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=178}} In order to improve their chances against the Roman Empire the Ostrogoths and [[Visigoths]] began again to unite in what became a loose confederation of Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} The two branches of the nation were soon brought closer together; after he was forced to become regent of the Visigothic kingdom of [[Toulouse]], the power of Theodoric was practically extended over a large part of [[Gaul]] and over nearly the whole of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Theodoric forged alliances with the Visigoths, Alamanni, Franks and Burgundians, some of which were accomplished through diplomatic marriages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic dominion was once again as far-reaching and splendid as it was in the time of [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]; however it was now of a wholly different character. The dominion of Theodoric was not a [[barbarian]] but a [[civilization|civilized]] power. His twofold position ran through everything. He was at once king of the Goths and successor, though without any imperial titles, of the Western [[Roman emperor]]s.  The two nations, differing in manners, language and religion, lived side by side on the soil of Italy; each was ruled according to its own law, by the prince who was, in his two separate characters, the common sovereign of both.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Due to his ability to foster and leverage relations among the various Germanic kingdoms, the Byzantines began to fear Theodoric's power, which led to an alliance between the Byzantine emperor and the Frankish king, [[Clovis I]], a pact designed to counteract and ultimately overthrow the Ostrogoths. In some ways Theodoric may have been overly accommodating to both the Romans and other Gothic people as he placated Catholics and Arian Christians alike. Historian Herwig Wolfram suggests that Theodoric's efforts in trying to appease Latin and barbarian cultures in kind brought about the collapse of Ostrogothic predominance and also resulted in the \"end of Italy as the heartland of late antiquity.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=332}} All the years of creating a protective perimeter around Italy were broken down by the Franco-Byzantine coalition. Theodoric was able to temporarily salvage some of his realm with the assistance of the Thuringians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=218\u2013221}} Realizing that the Franks were the most significant threat to the Visigothic empire as well, Alaric II, (who was the son-in-law of Theodoric) enlisted the aid of the Burgundians and fought against the Franks at the urging of the magnates of his tribe, but this choice proved an error and he allegedly met his end at the hand of the Frankish king, Clovis.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=155}}\n\nA time of confusion followed the death of [[Alaric II]] who was slain during the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. The Ostrogothic king Theodoric stepped in as the guardian of his grandson [[Amalaric]],{{sfn|Larned|1895|p=134}} and preserved for him all his Iberian and a fragment of his Gallic dominion. Toulouse passed to the [[Franks]] but the Goths kept [[Narbonne]] and its district and [[Septimania]], which was the last part of Gaul held by the Goths, keeping the name of Gothia for many years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} While Theodoric lived, the Visigothic kingdom was practically united to his own dominion. He seems also to have claimed a kind of protectorate over the [[Germany|Germanic]] powers generally, and indeed to have practically exercised it, except in the case of the [[Franks]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} From 508\u2013511 under Theodoric's command, the Ostrogoths marched on Gaul as the Vandal king of Carthage and Clovis made concerted efforts to weaken his hold on the Visigoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=220}} On the death of Theodoric in 526, the eastern and western Goths were once again divided.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=225}} By the late 6th century, the Ostrogoths lost their political identity and assimilated into other Germanic tribes.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\n[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mosaic depicting the palace of Theodoric the Great in his palace chapel of [[San Apollinare Nuovo]]]]\n\nThe picture of Theodoric's rule is drawn for us in the state papers drawn up, in his name and in the names of his successors, by his Roman minister [[Cassiodorus]].

The few instances where they acted together after this time are as scattered and incidental as they were before. Amalaric succeeded to the Visigothic kingdom in Iberia and Septimania. Theodoric's grandson [[Athalaric]] took on the mantle as king of the Ostrogoths for the next five years.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=334}} [[Provence]] was added to the dominion of the new Ostrogothic king Athalaric and through his daughter [[Amalasuntha]] who was named regent.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} Both were unable to settle disputes among Gothic elites.

Atop this infighting, the Ostrogoths faced the doctrinal challenges incurred from their Arian Christianity, which both the aristocracy of Byzantium and the Papacy strongly opposed\u2014so much that it brought them together.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}}\n\nThe weakness of the Ostrogothic position in Italy now showed itself, particularly when Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]] enacted a law excluding pagans\u2014among them Arian Christians and Jews\u2014from public employment.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} The Ostrogothic King Theodoric reacted by persecuting Catholics.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} Nonetheless, Justinian always strove to restore as much of the Western Roman Empire as he could and certainly would not pass up the opportunity. Launched on both land and sea, Justinian began his war of reconquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=339}} In 535, he commissioned [[Belisarius]] to attack the Ostrogoths following the success he had in North Africa against the Vandals.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=500\u2013501}} It was Justinian's intention to recover Italy and Rome from the Goths.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=501}}  Belisarius quickly captured Sicily and then crossed into Italy, where he captured Naples and Rome in December of 536. Sometime during the spring of 537, the Goths marched on Rome with upwards of 100,000 men under the leadership of [[Witiges]] and laid siege to the city, albeit unsuccessfully. Despite outnumbering the Romans by a five-to-one margin, the Goths could not loose Belisarius from the former western capital of the Empire.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=89\u201390}} After recuperating from siege warfare, Belisarius marched north, taking Mediolanum ([[Milan]]) and the Ostrogoth capital of Ravenna in 540.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\nWith the attack on Ravenna, Witiges and his men were trapped in the Ostrogothic capital. Belisarius proved more capable at [[siege warfare]] than his rival Witiges had been at Rome and the Ostrogoth ruler, who was also dealing with Frankish enemies, was forced to surrender, but not without terms. Belisarius refused to grant any concessions save unconditional surrender in view of the fact that Justinian wanted to make Witiges a vassal king in Trans-Padane Italy.{{sfn|Oman|1902|p=91}} This condition made for something of an impasse.\n\n[[File:Totila fa dstruggere la citt\u00e0 di Firenze.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Totila razes the walls of [[Florence]]: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of [[Giovanni Villani|Villani's ''Cronica'']]]]\n\nA faction of the Gothic nobility pointed out that their own king [[Witiges]], who had just lost, was something of a weakling and they would need a new one. [[Eraric]], the leader of the group, endorsed Belisarius and the rest of the kingdom agreed, so they offered him their crown.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=503}}  Belisarius was a soldier, not a statesman, and still loyal to Justinian. He made as if to accept the offer, rode to Ravenna to be crowned, and promptly arrested the leaders of the Goths and reclaimed their entire kingdom\u2014no halfway settlements\u2014for the Empire. Fearful that Belisarius might set himself up a permanent kingship should he consolidate his conquests, Justinian recalled him to Constantinople with Witiges in tow.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=208}}\n\nAs soon as Belisarius was gone, the remaining Ostrogoths elected a new king named [[Totila]]. Under the brilliant command of Totila, the Goths were able to reassert themselves to a degree. For a period of nearly ten years, control for Italy became a seesaw battle between Byzantine and Ostrogothic forces.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=210}} Totila eventually recaptured all of northern Italy and even drove the Byzantines out of Rome, thereby affording him the opportunity to take political control of the city, partly by executing the Roman senatorial order. Many of them fled eastwards for Constantinople.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}}\n\nBy 550 Justinian was able to put together an enormous force, an assembly designed to recover his losses and subdue any Gothic resistance. In 551, the Roman navy destroyed Totila's fleet and in 552 an overwhelming Byzantine force under [[Narses]] entered Italy from the north. Attempting to surprise the invading Byzantines, Totila gambled with his forces at [[Battle of Taginae|Taginaei]], where he was slain.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}} Broken but not yet defeated, the Ostrogoths made one final stand at Campania under a chief named Teia, but when he was also killed in battle at [[Nuceria]] they finally capitulated. On surrendering, they informed Narses that evidently \"the hand of God was against them\" and so they left Italy for the northern lands of their fathers.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=95\u201396}} After that final defeat, the Ostrogothic name wholly died. The nation had practically evaporated with Theodoric's death. The leadership of western Europe therefore passed by default to the Franks.  Consequently, Ostrogothic failure and Frankish success  were crucial for the development of [[early medieval Europe]], for Theodoric had made it \"his intention to restore the vigor of Roman government and Roman culture\".{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=105\u2013107}} The chance of forming a national state in Italy by the union of Roman and Germanic elements, such as those that arose in Gaul, in Iberia, and in parts of Italy under Lombard rule, was thus lost. The failures of the barbarian kingdoms to maintain control of the regions they conquered were partly the result of leadership vacuums like those which resulted from the death of Theodoric (also the lack of male succession) and Totila but additionally as a consequence of political fragmentation amid the Germanic tribes as their loyalties wavered between their kin and their erstwhile enemies. Frankish entry onto the geopolitical map of Europe also bears into play:  had the Ostrogoths attained more military success against the Byzantines on the battlefield by combining the strength of other Germanic tribes, this could have changed the direction of Frankish loyalty.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=505\u2013512}} Military success or defeat and political legitimacy were interrelated in barbarian society.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=512}}\n\nNevertheless, according to Roman historian [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the Ostrogothic population was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. They later joined the Lombards during their conquest of Italy.{{efn|''De Bello Gothico'' IV 32, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013245; this reference stems from the pen of the Byzantine historian, Procopius, who accompanied Justinian's leading general, Belisarius, on his exploits between 527 and 540. This included the campaigns against the Ostrogoths, which is the subject of ''De Bello Gothico''.}}\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Orecchini ostrogoti.jpg|thumb|250px|Ostrogoth ear jewels, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nSurviving Gothic writings in the [[Gothic language]] include the Bible of [[Ulfilas]] and other religious writings and fragments. In terms of Gothic legislation in [[Latin]], we have the [[edict of Theodoric]] from around the year 500, and the ''Variae'' of Cassiodorus, which may also pass as a collection of the state papers of Theodoric and his immediate successors. Among the Visigoths, written laws had already been put forth by [[Euric]]. Alaric II put forth a Breviarium of [[Roman law]] for his Roman subjects; but the great collection of Visigothic laws dates from the later days of the monarchy, being put forth by King [[Reccaswinth]] about 654. This code gave occasion to some well-known comments by Montesquieu and [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], and has been discussed by Savigny (''Geschichte des r\u00f6mischen Rechts'', ii. 65) and various other writers. They are printed in the ''Monumenta Germaniae, leges'', tome i. (1902).{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n \nAmid Gothic histories that remain, besides that of the frequently quoted Jordanes, there is the Gothic history of [[Isidore]], archbishop of [[Seville]], a special source of the history of the Visigothic kings down to [[Suinthila]] (621-631). But all the Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]] writers contemporary with the days of Gothic predominance also made their contributions. Not for special facts, but for a general estimate, no writer is more instructive than [[Salvian of Marseilles]] in the 5th century, whose work, ''De Gubernatione Dei'', is full of passages contrasting the vices of the Romans with the virtues of the \"barbarians\", especially of the Goths. In all such pictures one must allow a good deal for exaggeration both ways, but there must be a groundwork of truth. The chief virtues that the [[Roman Catholic]] [[presbyter]] praises in the Arian Goths are their chastity, their piety according to their own creed, their tolerance towards the Catholics under their rule, and their general good treatment of their Roman subjects. He even ventures to hope that such good people may be saved, notwithstanding their [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. This image must have had some basis in truth, but it is not very surprising that the later Visigoths of Iberia had fallen away from Salvian's somewhat idealistic picture.{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n\n==6th century Scandinavian Ostrogoths (Jordanes)==\n[[File:Scandza.PNG|thumb|right|Possible map of [[Scandza]] based on [[Jordanes]]' work]]\nJordanes named a people called the Ostrogoths (''Ostrogothae'') in a list of many peoples living on the large island of \"Scandza\", north of the mouth of the [[Vistula]], which most modern scholars understand to refer to the Scandinavian peninsula. The implication was that these Ostrogoths were living there in the 6th century, during the same period when there was a powerful Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy. On the other hand, scholars have come to no consensus about when the list was made, and by whom, nor how to interpret most of the names in the list. Arne S\u00f8by Christensen, in his detailed analysis lists three possibilities:{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=250\u2013299}}\n*that Jordanes believed some Ostrogoths had emigrated north, or...\n*that a similar name \"Eastern Goths\" had been coined in Scandinavia, where there were a people with the related name, the [[Gauts]], or...\n*that a source of Jordanes, for example Cassiodorus, had created this form of the name, perhaps having heard of the Gauts.\n\nJordanes makes his appeal about the origins of the Goths by putting them to paper, since he favored written sources over oral ones. It is possible that these oral narratives were circulating in Constantinople.{{sfn|Ghosh|2015|p=52}} Historian Shami Ghosh points out that while Jordanes may have been attempting to \"assert the Goths irrevocable involvement in the Roman world,\" the references to \"old wives' tales\" and songs represent an oral tradition that \"need not mean anything at all.\"{{sfn|Ghosh|2015|pp=52\u201353}} Ghosh adds, \"In terms of explicit references to oral sources, therefore, Jordanes gives us very little, and what we find in the ''Getica'' in this regard is of dubious value.\"{{sfn|Ghosh|2015|p=54}}\n\n==Ostrogothic rulers==\n===Amal dynasty===\n* [[Valamir]]  r. 447 &ndash; c. 465 succeeded by his brother...\n* [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]] r. c. 465 &ndash; 475 succeeded by his son...\n* [[Theodoric the Great]]  r. 475\u2013526 succeeded by his grandson...\n* [[Athalaric]] r. 526\u2013534 succeeded by his mother...\n* [[Amalasuntha]], r. 534-535 the daughter of Theodoric, succeeded by her first cousin...\n* [[Theodahad]] r. 535\u2013536 the son of Theodoric's sister.\n\n===Later kings===\n* [[Witiges]] r. 536\u2013540\n* [[Ildibad]] r. 540\u2013541\n* [[Eraric]] r. 541\n* [[Totila]] (also ''Baduila'') r. 541\u2013552  \n* [[Teia|Theia]] (also ''Teia(s)'', ''Teja'')  r. 552\u2013553\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[List of Germanic tribes]]\n* [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]\n* [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]]\n* [[Chernyakhov culture]]\n* [[Oium]]\n* [[Wielbark culture]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|author-link=Patrick Amory |title=People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489\u2013554''. |publication-place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-52635-3 |doi=10.1086/ahr/103.5.1569 |first=Patrick |last=Amory}}.\n* {{cite book | last=Backman| first=Clifford R | year=2008 | title= The Worlds of Medieval Europe | place= Oxford and New York | publisher= Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-533527-9| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last=Bauer | first=Susan Wise | year=2010 | title=The History of the Medieval World: From the Conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade | place=New York | publisher= W.

In the 5th century, they followed the [[Visigoths]] in creating one of the two great [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdoms within the [[Roman Empire]], based upon the large Gothic populations who had settled in the [[Balkans]] in the 4th century, having crossed the [[Lower Danube]]. While the Visigoths had formed under the leadership of [[Alaric I]], the new Ostrogothic political entity which came to rule Italy, was formed in the Balkans under the influence of the [[Amal Dynasty]]\n\nAfter the death of [[Attila]] and collapse of the [[Hunnic empire]] represented by the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 453, the [[Amal Dynasty]], the family of [[Theodoric the Great]], began to form their kingdom in [[Pannonia]]. [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] played these Pannonian Goths off against the [[Thracian Goths]], but instead the two groups united after the death of the Thracian leader [[Theoderic Strabo]] and his son Recitach. Zeno then backed Theodoric to invade Italy and replace [[Odoacer]], who he had previously supported as its king. In 493 Theodoric the Great established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of [[Italy]], when he defeated Odoacer's forces, and killed his rival at a banquet. \n\nA period of instability then ensued, eventually tempting the [[Byzantine|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Justinian]] to declare war on the Ostrogoths in 535, in an effort to restore the former western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. Initially, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] were successful, but under the leadership of [[Totila]], the [[Goths]] reconquered most of the lost territory until Totila's death at the [[Battle of Taginae]]. [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|The war]] lasted for almost 21 years and caused enormous damage across Italy, reducing the population of the peninsula. Any remaining Ostrogoths in Italy were absorbed into the [[Lombards]], who established a [[Lombard Kingdom|kingdom]] in Italy in 568.\n\nAs with other Gothic groups, the history of the peoples who made them up before they reached the Roman Balkans is difficult to reconstruct in detail. However, the Ostrogoths are associated with the earlier [[Greuthungi]]. The Ostrogoths themselves were more commonly referred to simply as Goths even in the 5th century, but before then they were referred to once, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which associates them with a group of Greuthungi, settled as a military unit in [[Phrygia]]. Furthermore, the 6th century historian of the Goths Jordanes also equated the Ostrogoths of his time to the Goths ruled by King [[Ermanaric]] in the 4th century, who the Roman writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] had called Greuthungi, and described as living between the [[Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers. [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] attacked the Goths from the east and large groups of Goths moved into the Roman empire, while others became subservient to the Huns.\n\n==Goths==\n{{Main article|Goths|Chernyakhov culture|Oium|Gothic runic inscriptions}}\n[[File:Chernyakhov.PNG|thumb|{{legend|#0f0|Traditional [[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|Island of [[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark Culture]], early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]], early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\nThe Ostrogoths were one of several peoples referred to more generally as Goths. The Goths appear in Roman records starting in the third century, in the regions north of the [[Lower Danube]] and [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=109\u2013110}} They competed for influence with peoples who had lived longer in the area, such as the [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]], and various [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=116,127\u2013128}} Based on their Germanic language and material culture it is believed that the Gothic culture derived from cultures originally from the direction of the [[Vistula]] river, in the north, and now in [[Poland]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=115\u2013117}} By the third century, the Goths were already in sub-groups with their own names, because the [[Tervingi]], who bordered on the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Carpathian mountains]], were mentioned separately on at least one occasion.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths, not mentioned until later, are associated with the Greuthungi who lived further east. The dividing line between the Tervingi and the Greuthungi, was reported by Ammianus to be the [[Dniester River]], and to the east of the Greuthungi were [[Alans]] living near the River Don.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=151\u2013153}}\n\n===Gothic Language===\n{{Main|Gothic language}}\nThe Ostrogoths in Italy used the Gothic language, which is best attested today in the surviving translation of the Bible by the Visigothic bishop [[Ulfilas]]. While none of the eastern Germanic languages are still spoken, Gothic is the only one with \"continuous texts\" remaining. These comprise the earliest remnants of a [[Germanic language]].{{efn|A language related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] was still spoken sporadically in [[Crimea]] as late as the 16th and 17th centuries ([[Crimean Gothic language]]).{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Much of the disappearance of the Gothic language is attributable to the Goths' cultural and linguistic absorption by other European peoples during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=572}} }}\n\n===Etymology===\n{{see|Greuthungi#Etymology|Goths#Name}}\n[[File:GNM - Gotische Fibeln.jpg|thumb|right|Ostrogothic bow-fibulae (c. 500) from [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Italy]]]]\n\nThe first part of the word \"Ostrogoth\" comes from a [[Germani language|Germanic]] root \"*auster-\" meaning eastern. According to the proposal of Wolfram, this was originally a boastful tribal name meaning \"Goths of the rising sun\", or \"Goths glorified by the rising sun\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=25, 387 fn49, 388 fn58}}{{Efn|Wolfram cites Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld's (1911) work, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und V\u00f6lkernamen'' as his principle naming source. See: [https://archive.org/details/wrterbuchderaltg00schn/page/39 p.39].}} By the 6th century, however, Jordanes, for example, believed that the Visigoths and Ostrogoths were two contrasting names simply meaning western and eastern Goths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=206}}\n\n==History==\n\n===The Greuthungi and Ostrogothi before the Huns===\n{{Further|Greuthungi}}\nThe nature of the divisions of the Goths before the arrival of the Huns is uncertain, but the Ostrogoths are only mentioned by that name very rarely and normally in very uncertain contexts. Among other Gothic group names however, they are associated with the Greuthungi. Scholarly opinions are various. Historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] sees these as two names for one people as will be discussed below. [[Peter Heather]], in contrast, has written that: \n<blockquote>Ostrogoths in the sense of the group led by Theodoric to Italy stand at the end of complex processes of fragmentation and unification involving a variety of groups - mostly but not solely Gothic it seems - and the better, more contemporary, evidence argues against the implication derived from Jordanes that Ostrogoths are Greuthungi by another name.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=404}}</blockquote>\n\nSome historians go much further than Heather, questioning whether we can assume any single ethnicity, even Gothic, which united the Ostrogoths before they were politically united by the Amal clan.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Heather|2007}} explains Heather's position in contrast to those of {{harvtxt|Amory|1997}}. Also see {{harvtxt|Kulikowski|2002}}.}}\n\nOne dubious early mention of the Ostrogoths is found in the much later-written ''Historia Augusta''. In the article for Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] (reigned 268\u2013270), the following list of \"[[Scythian]]\" peoples is given who had been conquered by the emperor when he earned his title \"Gothicus\": \"''peuci trutungi ''austorgoti'' uirtingi sigy pedes celtae etiam eruli''\". These words are traditionally edited by modern to include well-known peoples: \"''[[Peuci]], Grutungi, ''Austrogoti'', Tervingi, Visi, Gipedes, [[Celts|Celtae]] etiam et [[Heruli|Eruli]]''\" (emphasis added). However this work is not considered reliable, especially for contemporary terminology.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=201\u2013205}}\n\nThe first record of a Gothic sub-group acting in its own name, specifically the [[Tervingi]], was dated from 291.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24, fn52}}<ref>''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' XI 17.1 (dated 291)</ref> The [[Greuthungi]], [[Vesi]], and Ostrogothi are all attested no earlier than 388.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} \n\nThe Ostrogoths were first definitely mentioned more than one hundred years later than the Tervingi in 399, and this is the only certain mention of this name at all before the Amals created their kingdom of Italy. A poem by [[Claudian]] describes Ostrogoths who are mixed with Greuthungi and settled in [[Phrygia]] together as a disgruntled barbarian military force, who had once fought against Rome, but were now supposed to fight for it. Claudian only uses the term Ostrogoth once, but in other references to this same group he more often calls them Greuthungi or \"[[Getae|Getic]]\" (an older word used for Goths generally in this period). These Goths came to be led into rebellion by [[Tribigild]], a Roman general of Gothic background. Much later [[Zosimus]] also described Tribigild and his rebellion against the eunuch consul Eutropius. [[Gainas]], the aggrieved Gothic general sent to fight Tribigild, openly joined forces with him after the death of Eutropius. Zosimus believed that was conspiracy between the two Goths from the beginning.{{efn|Claudian, ''Against Eutropius'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/In_Eutropium/2*.html#141A 2.141]; Zosimus, ''New History'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth Book 5].

Note Wolfram describes this as a poem to 392, though as Christensen and Cameron et al. note, it was written after the death of [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius the consul]] (died 399). On the dating of Claudian's poem see {{harvtxt|Long|1996|loc=ch.5}}.}} It is generally believed by historians that this Phrygian settlement of Greuthingi, referred to as including Ostrogoths, were part of the Greuthungi-led force led by [[Odotheus]] in 386, and not the Greuthungi who had entered the empire earlier, in 376 under [[Alatheus and Saphrax]].{{sfn|Heather|1988|p=156}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=214}} \n\nBased upon the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], whose ''[[Getica]]'' is a history of the Ostrogothic Amal dynasty, there is a tradition of simply equating the [[Greuthungi]] with the Ostrogothi.{{sfn|Heather|1996|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Jordanes does not mention the Greuthungi, but he identified the Ostrogothic kings, the [[Amal dynasty]], including [[Theodoric the Great]], as the heirs and descendants of king [[Ermanaric]]. Ermanaric was described by the more reliable contemporary writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] as a king of the Greuthungi, however the family succession described by the two classical authors is completely in conflict, and Ammianus is considered to be the more reliable source.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|pp=141\u2013157}} summarizes the field's position: \"There has never been any doubt that of these two conflicting accounts, the one by Ammianus Marcellinus was to be preferred\". Christensen especially cites {{harvtxt|Heather|1989}}.}} Jordanes also specified that around 250 (the time of Emperor [[Philip the Arab]] who reigned 244\u2013249) the Ostrogoths were ruled by a king called [[Ostrogotha]] and they either derived their name from this \"father of the Ostrogoths\", or else the Ostrogoths and Visigoths got these names because they meant eastern and western Goths.{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|pp=87\u201388 [XXIV.130\u2013XXV.131]}}\n\nModern historians agree that Jordanes is unreliable, but some historians such as Herwig Wolfram defend the equation of the Greuthungi and Ostrogoths. Wolfram follows the position of [[Franz Altheim]] that the terms Tervingi and Greuthungi were older geographical identifiers used by outsiders to describe these Visigoths and Ostrogoths before they crossed the Danube, and that this terminology dropped out of use after about 400, when many Goths had moved into the Roman empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}} In contrast, according to him, the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples themselves to boastfully describe themselves, and thus remained in use. In support of this, Wolfram argues that it is significant that Roman writers either used terminology contrasting Tervingi and Greuthungi, or Vesi/Visigoths and Ostrogoths, and never mixed these pairs \u2014 for example they never contrasted Tervingi and Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} There are two examples of Roman texts which mix Wolfram's proposed geographical and boastful terminologies, but neither contrasts (supposedly) geographical and boastful terms. First, as mentioned above, Ostrogoths and Greuthungi were mentioned together by the poet Claudian, and secondly, all four names were used together in the unreliable ''[[Augustan History]]'' for the Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] which has \"''Gruthungi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi''\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=202\u2013203}} As a second argument for this geographical versus boastful contrast, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to the group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] after 376 who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians, arguing that these \"can only\" be Thervingi, and that this shows how the name \"Greuthungi\" was only used by outsiders.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} However, as mentioned above, these Greuthungi mentioned by Zosimus are those who Heather and other historians equate to the rebellious Greuthungi mentioned later by Claudian in Phrygia in 399\u2013400, who were, according to Claudian, mixed with Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Heather|1988|p=156}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=214}} \n\nIn any case, the older terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after they entered the Roman Empire. The term \"Visigoth\" was an invention of the sixth century. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term ''Visigothi'' to match ''Ostrogothi'', which terms he thought of as \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western-eastern division was a simplification and a literary device of sixth-century historians where political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Furthermore, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gallo-Hispanic Goths]]. This usage, however, was adopted by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was in use in the seventh century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nOther names for the Goths abounded. A \"Germanic\" Byzantine or Italian author referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Valagothi'', meaning \"Roman [''[[walha]]''] Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} In 484 the Ostrogoths had been called the ''Valameriaci'' (men of Valamir) because they followed Theodoric, a descendant of Valamir.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} This terminology survived in the Byzantine East as late as the reign of [[Athalaric]], who was called ''\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5'' (''tou Oualemeriakou'') by [[John Malalas]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=389, fn67}}\n\n===Hunnic invasions and the Amals===\n{{Main|History of the Huns}}\nIn the late 4th century, the rise of the [[Huns]] forced many of the Goths and Alans to join them, while others moved westwards and eventually moved into Roman territory in the [[Balkans]]. Ostrogoths and Greuthungi, perhaps the same people, are believed to have been among the first Goths who were subdued by the Huns.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=55}} Many Greuthungi entered the Roman Empire in 376 with [[Saphrax and Alatheus]], and many of these Goths probably subsequently joined Alaric, contributing to the formation of the [[Visigothic kingdom]]. As discussed above a group of Ostrogoths and Greuthungi were apparently also settled in Phrygia in the 380s by the Romans. Otherwise, historical records only begin to mention the name of the Ostrogoths as the Gothic political entity which formed in the Balkans in the 5th century. \n\nThe Amal-led Ostrogothic kingdom began to coalesce around the leadership of the [[Amal dynasty]] who had fought under [[Attila]], and later settled in [[Pannonia]]. The second major component of the Amal kingdom's population were the [[Thracian Goths]]. This occurred around 483/484.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=73}}{{sfn|Heather|2003|p=90}}\n\nThe Pannonian Ostrogoths had fought alongside both Alans and Huns.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=177}} Like several other tribal peoples, they became one of the many Hunnic vassals fighting in Europe, as in the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451, where the Huns were defeated by the Roman general Aetius, accompanied by a contingent of Alans, and Visigoths.{{sfn|Kim|2013|pp=75, 77}} Jordanes' account of this battle certainly cannot be trusted as he wrongly attributes a good portion of the victory to the Goths, when it was the Alans who formed the \"backbone of Roman defences.\"{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=77}} More generally, Jordanes, depicts the Amals as an ancient royal family in his ''Getica'', making them traditionally preeminent among the Goths in the Ukraine, both before and during the empire of Attila. [[Valamir]], the uncle of Theodoric the Great, is even depicted as Attila's most highly valued leader along with [[Ardaric]] of the Gepids.{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=107 [XXXVIII.199\u2013200]}} Modern historians such as [[Peter Heather]] believe this is an exaggeration, and point out that there were at least three factions of Goths in Attila's forces.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=222}}{{sfn|Heather|2007|pp=46\u201347, 72\u201373}}\n\nThe recorded history of the Ostrogoths as a political entity thus begins with their independence from the remains of the Hunnic Empire following the death of [[Attila the Hun]] in 453. Under Valimir they were among the peoples who were living in the [[Middle Danube]] region by this time, and whose freedom from domination by Attila's sons was confirmed by the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454, which was led by the [[Gepids]]. It is unclear what role the Goths played in this battle, if any, and after the battle many Goths entered Roman military service, while only some began to coalesce under the leadership of Valamir and his two brothers, Vidimir and [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], the father of [[Theodoric the Great]].{{sfn|Burns|1984|pp=52\u201353}} \n\nThese Amal-led Goths apparently first settled in the Pannonian area of [[Lake Balaton]] and Sirmium ([[Sremska Mitrovica]]), on the Roman Danube frontier. The land they acquired between Vindobona (Vienna) and Sirmium ([[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was not well-managed, a fact which rendered the Ostrogoths dependent upon Constantinople for subsidies.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=178}} They came into conflict with other [[Middle Danube|Middle Danubian]] peoples including the Danubian [[Suebian]] kingdom of [[Hunimund]], and the [[Scirii]], who had arrived as part of the Hunnic empire, and this led to the death of Valimir, and eventual Gothic victory at the [[Battle of Bolia]] in 469, now under Theodemir. Theodemer brought these Goths into East Roman territory in 473/474.{{sfn|Heather|2003|p=86}}\n\nThe Thracian Goths, according to Peter Heather had probably become unified only in about the 460s, although they probably lived in the area since the 420s.{{sfn|Heather|2003|pp=88, 91}} They formed a military force which was loyal to [[Aspar]], the East Roman ''magister militum'' (\"master of soldiers\") of Alanic-Gothic descent, who was killed in 471. Aspar's death saw a change in the East Roman approach to Gothic military forces. Theoderic Strabo led a revolt in 473. Wolfram proposed that Theoderic Strabo was an Amal, whose father had split with Theoderic's branch on around the time of the Battle of Nadao.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=32, 260}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths followed a similar path in the Balkans to the Alaric-led Visigoths played the century before. They gained momentum by merging two large blocks of militarized Balkan peoples including many who had fought for the Roman Empire, the Pannonian and Thracian Goths; they had a difficult relationship with the Eastern Roman power; they were reinforced by smaller groups such as the [[Rugii]]; and then just as the West Goths had done before them, they passed from the East to the West.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Kingdom in Italy===\n{{History of Italy}}\n{{Main article|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Ostrogothic Kingdom.png|right|300px|thumb|Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy]]\n\nThe greatest of all Ostrogothic rulers, the future [[Theodoric the Great]] (whose Gothic name meant \"leader of the people\") of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (''Regnum Italiae'', \"Kingdom of Italy\"){{efn|See: http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cassiodorus/varia2.shtml Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, ''Variae'', Lib.

His childhood was spent at [[Constantinople]] as a diplomatic [[hostage]], where he was carefully educated.{{sfn|Backman|2008|p=68}}  The early part of his life was taken up with various disputes, intrigues and wars within the [[Byzantine empire]], in which he had as his rival [[Theodoric Strabo]] of the [[Thracian Goths]], a distant relative of Theodoric the Great and son of [[Triarius]]. This older but lesser Theodoric seems to have been the chief, not the king, of that branch of the Ostrogoths that had settled within the Empire earlier.  Theodoric the Great, as he is sometimes distinguished, was sometimes the friend, sometimes the enemy, of the Empire.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} In the former case he was clothed with various Roman titles and offices, as [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[consul]]; but in all cases alike he remained the national Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Theodoric is also known for his attainment of support from the [[Catholic Church]] and on one occasion, he even helped resolve a disputed papal election.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=338}} During his reign, Theodoric, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], allowed freedom of religion, which had not been done before. However, he did try to appease the [[Pope]] and tried to keep his alliance with the church strong. He saw the Pope as an authority not only in the church but also over Rome itself. His ability to work well with Italy's nobles, members of the Roman Senate, and the Catholic Church all helped facilitate his acceptance as the ruler of Italy.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\nTheodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and in doing so, profited the Italian people.{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=109}} It was in both characters together that he set out in 488, by commission from the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], to recover [[Italy]] from [[Odoacer]].  In 489, the [[Rugii]], a Germanic tribe who dwelt in the [[Hungarian Plain]], joined the Ostrogoths in their invasion of Italy under their leader [[Frideric]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=665}} By 493 [[Ravenna]] was taken, where Theodoric would set up his capital. It was also at this time that Odoacer was killed by Theodoric's own hand.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Ostrogothic power was fully established over Italy, [[Sicily]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and the lands to the north of Italy. Around 500, Theodoric celebrated his thirtieth anniversary as King of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=178}} In order to improve their chances against the Roman Empire the Ostrogoths and [[Visigoths]] began again to unite in what became a loose confederation of Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} The two branches of the nation were soon brought closer together; after he was forced to become regent of the Visigothic kingdom of [[Toulouse]], the power of Theodoric was practically extended over a large part of [[Gaul]] and over nearly the whole of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Theodoric forged alliances with the Visigoths, Alamanni, Franks and Burgundians, some of which were accomplished through diplomatic marriages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic dominion was once again as far-reaching and splendid as it was in the time of [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]; however it was now of a wholly different character. The dominion of Theodoric was not a [[barbarian]] but a [[civilization|civilized]] power. His twofold position ran through everything. He was at once king of the Goths and successor, though without any imperial titles, of the Western [[Roman emperor]]s.  The two nations, differing in manners, language and religion, lived side by side on the soil of Italy; each was ruled according to its own law, by the prince who was, in his two separate characters, the common sovereign of both.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Due to his ability to foster and leverage relations among the various Germanic kingdoms, the Byzantines began to fear Theodoric's power, which led to an alliance between the Byzantine emperor and the Frankish king, [[Clovis I]], a pact designed to counteract and ultimately overthrow the Ostrogoths. In some ways Theodoric may have been overly accommodating to both the Romans and other Gothic people as he placated Catholics and Arian Christians alike. Historian Herwig Wolfram suggests that Theodoric's efforts in trying to appease Latin and barbarian cultures in kind brought about the collapse of Ostrogothic predominance and also resulted in the \"end of Italy as the heartland of late antiquity.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=332}} All the years of creating a protective perimeter around Italy were broken down by the Franco-Byzantine coalition. Theodoric was able to temporarily salvage some of his realm with the assistance of the Thuringians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=218\u2013221}} Realizing that the Franks were the most significant threat to the Visigothic empire as well, Alaric II, (who was the son-in-law of Theodoric) enlisted the aid of the Burgundians and fought against the Franks at the urging of the magnates of his tribe, but this choice proved an error and he allegedly met his end at the hand of the Frankish king, Clovis.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=155}}\n\nA time of confusion followed the death of [[Alaric II]] who was slain during the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. The Ostrogothic king Theodoric stepped in as the guardian of his grandson [[Amalaric]],{{sfn|Larned|1895|p=134}} and preserved for him all his Iberian and a fragment of his Gallic dominion. Toulouse passed to the [[Franks]] but the Goths kept [[Narbonne]] and its district and [[Septimania]], which was the last part of Gaul held by the Goths, keeping the name of Gothia for many years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} While Theodoric lived, the Visigothic kingdom was practically united to his own dominion. He seems also to have claimed a kind of protectorate over the [[Germany|Germanic]] powers generally, and indeed to have practically exercised it, except in the case of the [[Franks]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} From 508\u2013511 under Theodoric's command, the Ostrogoths marched on Gaul as the Vandal king of Carthage and Clovis made concerted efforts to weaken his hold on the Visigoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=220}} On the death of Theodoric in 526, the eastern and western Goths were once again divided.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=225}} By the late 6th century, the Ostrogoths lost their political identity and assimilated into other Germanic tribes.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\n[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mosaic depicting the palace of Theodoric the Great in his palace chapel of [[San Apollinare Nuovo]]]]\n\nThe picture of Theodoric's rule is drawn for us in the state papers drawn up, in his name and in the names of his successors, by his Roman minister [[Cassiodorus]]. The Goths seem to have been thick on the ground in northern Italy; in the south they formed little more than garrisons.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2,865}} Meanwhile, the Frankish king Clovis fought protracted wars against various enemies while consolidating his rule, forming the embryonic stages of what would eventually become Medieval Europe.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=116\u2013137}}\n\n===War with Byzantium (535\u2013554)===\n{{Main article|Gothic War (535\u2013554)}}\n\n[[File:Theodahad 534 536 Ostrogoth minted in Rome.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Theodahad]] (534-536), minted in [[Rome]] \u2013 he wears the barbaric [[moustache]].]]\n\nAbsent the unifying presence of Theodoric, the Ostrogoths and Visigoths were unable to consolidate their realms despite their common Germanic kinship. The few instances where they acted together after this time are as scattered and incidental as they were before. Amalaric succeeded to the Visigothic kingdom in Iberia and Septimania. Theodoric's grandson [[Athalaric]] took on the mantle as king of the Ostrogoths for the next five years.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=334}} [[Provence]] was added to the dominion of the new Ostrogothic king Athalaric and through his daughter [[Amalasuntha]] who was named regent.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} Both were unable to settle disputes among Gothic elites.

Atop this infighting, the Ostrogoths faced the doctrinal challenges incurred from their Arian Christianity, which both the aristocracy of Byzantium and the Papacy strongly opposed\u2014so much that it brought them together.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}}\n\nThe weakness of the Ostrogothic position in Italy now showed itself, particularly when Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]] enacted a law excluding pagans\u2014among them Arian Christians and Jews\u2014from public employment.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} The Ostrogothic King Theodoric reacted by persecuting Catholics.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} Nonetheless, Justinian always strove to restore as much of the Western Roman Empire as he could and certainly would not pass up the opportunity. Launched on both land and sea, Justinian began his war of reconquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=339}} In 535, he commissioned [[Belisarius]] to attack the Ostrogoths following the success he had in North Africa against the Vandals.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=500\u2013501}} It was Justinian's intention to recover Italy and Rome from the Goths.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=501}}  Belisarius quickly captured Sicily and then crossed into Italy, where he captured Naples and Rome in December of 536. Sometime during the spring of 537, the Goths marched on Rome with upwards of 100,000 men under the leadership of [[Witiges]] and laid siege to the city, albeit unsuccessfully. Despite outnumbering the Romans by a five-to-one margin, the Goths could not loose Belisarius from the former western capital of the Empire.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=89\u201390}} After recuperating from siege warfare, Belisarius marched north, taking Mediolanum ([[Milan]]) and the Ostrogoth capital of Ravenna in 540.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\nWith the attack on Ravenna, Witiges and his men were trapped in the Ostrogothic capital. Belisarius proved more capable at [[siege warfare]] than his rival Witiges had been at Rome and the Ostrogoth ruler, who was also dealing with Frankish enemies, was forced to surrender, but not without terms. Belisarius refused to grant any concessions save unconditional surrender in view of the fact that Justinian wanted to make Witiges a vassal king in Trans-Padane Italy.{{sfn|Oman|1902|p=91}} This condition made for something of an impasse.\n\n[[File:Totila fa dstruggere la citt\u00e0 di Firenze.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Totila razes the walls of [[Florence]]: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of [[Giovanni Villani|Villani's ''Cronica'']]]]\n\nA faction of the Gothic nobility pointed out that their own king [[Witiges]], who had just lost, was something of a weakling and they would need a new one. [[Eraric]], the leader of the group, endorsed Belisarius and the rest of the kingdom agreed, so they offered him their crown.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=503}}  Belisarius was a soldier, not a statesman, and still loyal to Justinian. He made as if to accept the offer, rode to Ravenna to be crowned, and promptly arrested the leaders of the Goths and reclaimed their entire kingdom\u2014no halfway settlements\u2014for the Empire. Fearful that Belisarius might set himself up a permanent kingship should he consolidate his conquests, Justinian recalled him to Constantinople with Witiges in tow.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=208}}\n\nAs soon as Belisarius was gone, the remaining Ostrogoths elected a new king named [[Totila]]. Under the brilliant command of Totila, the Goths were able to reassert themselves to a degree. For a period of nearly ten years, control for Italy became a seesaw battle between Byzantine and Ostrogothic forces.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=210}} Totila eventually recaptured all of northern Italy and even drove the Byzantines out of Rome, thereby affording him the opportunity to take political control of the city, partly by executing the Roman senatorial order. Many of them fled eastwards for Constantinople.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}}\n\nBy 550 Justinian was able to put together an enormous force, an assembly designed to recover his losses and subdue any Gothic resistance. In 551, the Roman navy destroyed Totila's fleet and in 552 an overwhelming Byzantine force under [[Narses]] entered Italy from the north. Attempting to surprise the invading Byzantines, Totila gambled with his forces at [[Battle of Taginae|Taginaei]], where he was slain.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}} Broken but not yet defeated, the Ostrogoths made one final stand at Campania under a chief named Teia, but when he was also killed in battle at [[Nuceria]] they finally capitulated. On surrendering, they informed Narses that evidently \"the hand of God was against them\" and so they left Italy for the northern lands of their fathers.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=95\u201396}} After that final defeat, the Ostrogothic name wholly died. The nation had practically evaporated with Theodoric's death. The leadership of western Europe therefore passed by default to the Franks.  Consequently, Ostrogothic failure and Frankish success  were crucial for the development of [[early medieval Europe]], for Theodoric had made it \"his intention to restore the vigor of Roman government and Roman culture\".{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=105\u2013107}} The chance of forming a national state in Italy by the union of Roman and Germanic elements, such as those that arose in Gaul, in Iberia, and in parts of Italy under Lombard rule, was thus lost. The failures of the barbarian kingdoms to maintain control of the regions they conquered were partly the result of leadership vacuums like those which resulted from the death of Theodoric (also the lack of male succession) and Totila but additionally as a consequence of political fragmentation amid the Germanic tribes as their loyalties wavered between their kin and their erstwhile enemies. Frankish entry onto the geopolitical map of Europe also bears into play:  had the Ostrogoths attained more military success against the Byzantines on the battlefield by combining the strength of other Germanic tribes, this could have changed the direction of Frankish loyalty.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=505\u2013512}} Military success or defeat and political legitimacy were interrelated in barbarian society.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=512}}\n\nNevertheless, according to Roman historian [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the Ostrogothic population was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. They later joined the Lombards during their conquest of Italy.{{efn|''De Bello Gothico'' IV 32, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013245; this reference stems from the pen of the Byzantine historian, Procopius, who accompanied Justinian's leading general, Belisarius, on his exploits between 527 and 540. This included the campaigns against the Ostrogoths, which is the subject of ''De Bello Gothico''.}}\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Orecchini ostrogoti.jpg|thumb|250px|Ostrogoth ear jewels, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nSurviving Gothic writings in the [[Gothic language]] include the Bible of [[Ulfilas]] and other religious writings and fragments. In terms of Gothic legislation in [[Latin]], we have the [[edict of Theodoric]] from around the year 500, and the ''Variae'' of Cassiodorus, which may also pass as a collection of the state papers of Theodoric and his immediate successors. Among the Visigoths, written laws had already been put forth by [[Euric]]. Alaric II put forth a Breviarium of [[Roman law]] for his Roman subjects; but the great collection of Visigothic laws dates from the later days of the monarchy, being put forth by King [[Reccaswinth]] about 654. This code gave occasion to some well-known comments by Montesquieu and [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], and has been discussed by Savigny (''Geschichte des r\u00f6mischen Rechts'', ii. 65) and various other writers. They are printed in the ''Monumenta Germaniae, leges'', tome i. (1902).{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n \nAmid Gothic histories that remain, besides that of the frequently quoted Jordanes, there is the Gothic history of [[Isidore]], archbishop of [[Seville]], a special source of the history of the Visigothic kings down to [[Suinthila]] (621-631). But all the Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]] writers contemporary with the days of Gothic predominance also made their contributions. Not for special facts, but for a general estimate, no writer is more instructive than [[Salvian of Marseilles]] in the 5th century, whose work, ''De Gubernatione Dei'', is full of passages contrasting the vices of the Romans with the virtues of the \"barbarians\", especially of the Goths. In all such pictures one must allow a good deal for exaggeration both ways, but there must be a groundwork of truth. The chief virtues that the [[Roman Catholic]] [[presbyter]] praises in the Arian Goths are their chastity, their piety according to their own creed, their tolerance towards the Catholics under their rule, and their general good treatment of their Roman subjects. He even ventures to hope that such good people may be saved, notwithstanding their [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. This image must have had some basis in truth, but it is not very surprising that the later Visigoths of Iberia had fallen away from Salvian's somewhat idealistic picture.{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n\n==6th century Scandinavian Ostrogoths (Jordanes)==\n[[File:Scandza.PNG|thumb|right|Possible map of [[Scandza]] based on [[Jordanes]]' work]]\nJordanes named a people called the Ostrogoths (''Ostrogothae'') in a list of many peoples living on the large island of \"Scandza\", north of the mouth of the [[Vistula]], which most modern scholars understand to refer to the Scandinavian peninsula. The implication was that these Ostrogoths were living there in the 6th century, during the same period when there was a powerful Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy. On the other hand, scholars have come to no consensus about when the list was made, and by whom, nor how to interpret most of the names in the list. Arne S\u00f8by Christensen, in his detailed analysis lists three possibilities:{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=250\u2013299}}\n*that Jordanes believed some Ostrogoths had emigrated north, or...\n*that a similar name \"Eastern Goths\" had been coined in Scandinavia, where there were a people with the related name, the [[Gauts]], or...\n*that a source of Jordanes, for example Cassiodorus, had created this form of the name, perhaps having heard of the Gauts.\n\nJordanes makes his appeal about the origins of the Goths by putting them to paper, since he favored written sources over oral ones. It is possible that these oral narratives were circulating in Constantinople.{{sfn|Ghosh|2015|p=52}} Historian Shami Ghosh points out that while Jordanes may have been attempting to \"assert the Goths irrevocable involvement in the Roman world,\" the references to \"old wives' tales\" and songs represent an oral tradition that \"need not mean anything at all.\"{{sfn|Ghosh|2015|pp=52\u201353}} Ghosh adds, \"In terms of explicit references to oral sources, therefore, Jordanes gives us very little, and what we find in the ''Getica'' in this regard is of dubious value.\"{{sfn|Ghosh|2015|p=54}}\n\n==Ostrogothic rulers==\n===Amal dynasty===\n* [[Valamir]]  r. 447 &ndash; c. 465 succeeded by his brother...\n* [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]] r. c. 465 &ndash; 475 succeeded by his son...\n* [[Theodoric the Great]]  r. 475\u2013526 succeeded by his grandson...\n* [[Athalaric]] r. 526\u2013534 succeeded by his mother...\n* [[Amalasuntha]], r. 534-535 the daughter of Theodoric, succeeded by her first cousin...\n* [[Theodahad]] r. 535\u2013536 the son of Theodoric's sister.\n\n===Later kings===\n* [[Witiges]] r. 536\u2013540\n* [[Ildibad]] r. 540\u2013541\n* [[Eraric]] r. 541\n* [[Totila]] (also ''Baduila'') r. 541\u2013552  \n* [[Teia|Theia]] (also ''Teia(s)'', ''Teja'')  r. 552\u2013553\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[List of Germanic tribes]]\n* [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]\n* [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]]\n* [[Chernyakhov culture]]\n* [[Oium]]\n* [[Wielbark culture]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|author-link=Patrick Amory |title=People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489\u2013554''. |publication-place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-52635-3 |doi=10.1086/ahr/103.5.1569 |first=Patrick |last=Amory}}.\n* {{cite book | last=Backman| first=Clifford R | year=2008 | title= The Worlds of Medieval Europe | place= Oxford and New York | publisher= Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-533527-9| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last=Bauer | first=Susan Wise | year=2010 | title=The History of the Medieval World: From the Conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade | place=New York | publisher= W.
