Shah Alam replaced Kuala Lumpur as the capital city of the state of [[Selangor]] in 1978 due to Kuala Lumpur's incorporation into a [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] in 1974. Shah Alam was the first [[List of planned cities|planned city]] in Malaysia after [[Hari Merdeka|independence from Britain]] in 1957.\n\n==History==\nMalaysia grew rapidly after its independence in 1957 under its second [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], Allahyarham [[Tun Abdul Razak|Tun Abdul Razak Hussein]]. Shah Alam was once known as Sungai Renggam and was noted for its rubber and [[oil palm]] estates. Later, the same area was identified as [[Batu Tiga]] prior to Malaysian independence, and has been a centre of rubber and [[palm oil]] trade for centuries. The Sungai Renggam Plantation was earmarked for the development of a township by the Selangor government in 1963, and under the recommendations of Vlado Antolic, a town planning advisor from the United Nations, chose the present site strategically located between Kuala Lumpur and [[Port Klang]].<ref name=NST10a/>\n\nIts current name was chosen by the then state [[Sultan of Selangor]], [[Sultan Salahuddin|Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah]], after his late father [[Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah|Sultan Alam Shah]]. Many other monuments, buildings and even a street are named after the late Sultan. Shah Alam was opened in 1963 with the purpose of making it the new administrative centre of Selangor, replacing Kuala Lumpur which was made a Federal Territory on 1 February 1974. With the consent of the Sultan, Shah Alam was proclaimed the capital of Selangor on 7 December 1978 with an initial area of 41.68&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and administrated by a municipal council. \n\n===Enlargement===\nShah Alam was enlarged several times between 1983 and 1997, the last annexation on 1 January 1997:\n* 1983: Annexed Section 25-28 ([[Sri Muda (state constituency)|Sri Muda]] and [[Sungai Kandis (state constituency)|Sg Kandis]]) from Petaling District Council; 11.41 km<sup>2</sup> annexed\n* 1994: Annexed [[Setia Alam]], [[Bukit Jelutong]] and [[Subang Airport]] from Petaling District Council, and [[Kota Kemuning]] from [[Klang Municipal Council]]; 208.6 km<sup>2</sup> annexed\n* 1997: Annexed Paya Jaras and parts of [[Sungai Buloh]] from Petaling District Council, but ceded [[Putra Heights]] and Subang Hi-tech Industrial Park to [[Subang Jaya Municipal Council|Subang Jaya]]; 28.6 km<sup>2</sup> annexed\n\nThrough the Gazette Plan 1190, Shah Alam was extended to its present-day area of 293&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=mbsalatar>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbsa.gov.my/latar_belakang_shah_alam|title=Official Portal of Shah Alam City Council \u2013 History|work=mbsa.gov.my|date=24 June 2011|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===City status===\nShah Alam was granted city status on 10 October 2000 with Dato' Haji Abu Sujak Haji Mahmud as the first mayor.

The mosque has four [[minaret]]s erected at the corners, each minaret is 142.3&nbsp;m (460&nbsp;ft) tall. The mosque was commissioned by the late Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz when he declared Shah Alam as the new capital of Selangor on 14 February 1974. Construction of the mosque was completed on 11 March 1988. As the capital of Selangor, Islam is the religion preferred by a majority of Shah Alam residents.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tourismmalaysia.gov.my/en/destinations/item.asp?item=bluemosque | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120805224329/http://www.tourismmalaysia.gov.my/en/destinations/item.asp?item=bluemosque | url-status = dead | archive-date = 5 August 2012 | title = Tourism Malaysia-Selangor destinations-Blue Mosque | publisher = Government website-Tourism Malaysia | year = 2011 | accessdate = 26 January 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.virtualmalaysia.com/destination/blue%20mosque%20(sultan%20salahuddin%20abdul%20aziz%20shah%20mosque).html | title =Blue Mosque (Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Mosque) | publisher =Malaysian Ministry of Tourism-VirtualMalaysia.com | year =2011 | accessdate =26 January 2011 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110605044808/http://www.virtualmalaysia.com/destination/blue%20mosque%20%28sultan%20salahuddin%20abdul%20aziz%20shah%20mosque%29.html | archivedate =5 June 2011 | df =dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:SA Tourist Service Centre.jpg|thumb|SA Tourist Service Centre]]\n'''Garden of Islamic Arts'''\n\nThe Blue Mosque overlooks the Garden of Islamic Arts, a landscaped park inspired by the [[Jannah|Quranic Garden of Paradise]].

Besides sports matches, this stadium had been used for several occasions such as the final concert of [[Akademi Fantasia]] and the Perhimpunan Pekerja 2008 held by the Dewan Pemuda [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|PAS]]. The grandest occasion ever held in this stadium was the boxing finals of the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]] which saw Malaysian [[Sapok Biki]] winning a gold medal.\n\nThe Shah Alam Sports Complex also includes the Pusat Akuatik Darul Ehsan or the Darul Ehsan Aquatic Centre, a Go-Kart track located within the Stadium Shah Alam parking compound, as well as the Shah Alam Extreme Park located in Section 13.\n\nShah Alam hosted 2 events for the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]], road cycling and boxing.\n\nIn September 2016, a group of 7 men who are professionals in their own fields in football came together and formed Shah Alam Antlers F.C.

Shah Alam was once known as Sungai Renggam and was noted for its rubber and [[oil palm]] estates. Later, the same area was identified as [[Batu Tiga]] prior to Malaysian independence, and has been a centre of rubber and [[palm oil]] trade for centuries. The Sungai Renggam Plantation was earmarked for the development of a township by the Selangor government in 1963, and under the recommendations of Vlado Antolic, a town planning advisor from the United Nations, chose the present site strategically located between Kuala Lumpur and [[Port Klang]].<ref name=NST10a/>\n\nIts current name was chosen by the then state [[Sultan of Selangor]], [[Sultan Salahuddin|Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah]], after his late father [[Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah|Sultan Alam Shah]]. Many other monuments, buildings and even a street are named after the late Sultan. Shah Alam was opened in 1963 with the purpose of making it the new administrative centre of Selangor, replacing Kuala Lumpur which was made a Federal Territory on 1 February 1974. With the consent of the Sultan, Shah Alam was proclaimed the capital of Selangor on 7 December 1978 with an initial area of 41.68&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and administrated by a municipal council. \n\n===Enlargement===\nShah Alam was enlarged several times between 1983 and 1997, the last annexation on 1 January 1997:\n* 1983: Annexed Section 25-28 ([[Sri Muda (state constituency)|Sri Muda]] and [[Sungai Kandis (state constituency)|Sg Kandis]]) from Petaling District Council; 11.41 km<sup>2</sup> annexed\n* 1994: Annexed [[Setia Alam]], [[Bukit Jelutong]] and [[Subang Airport]] from Petaling District Council, and [[Kota Kemuning]] from [[Klang Municipal Council]]; 208.6 km<sup>2</sup> annexed\n* 1997: Annexed Paya Jaras and parts of [[Sungai Buloh]] from Petaling District Council, but ceded [[Putra Heights]] and Subang Hi-tech Industrial Park to [[Subang Jaya Municipal Council|Subang Jaya]]; 28.6 km<sup>2</sup> annexed\n\nThrough the Gazette Plan 1190, Shah Alam was extended to its present-day area of 293&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=mbsalatar>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbsa.gov.my/latar_belakang_shah_alam|title=Official Portal of Shah Alam City Council \u2013 History|work=mbsa.gov.my|date=24 June 2011|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===City status===\nShah Alam was granted city status on 10 October 2000 with Dato' Haji Abu Sujak Haji Mahmud as the first mayor.
