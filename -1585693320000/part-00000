The series follows the adventures of slacker [[Philip J. Fry]], who is [[cryonics|cryogenically preserved]] for 1000 years and is revived in the 31st century. Fry finds work at an interplanetary delivery company, working alongside the one-eyed [[Leela (Futurama)|Turanga Leela]] and robot [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender Bending Rodriguez]]. The series was envisioned by Groening in the mid-1990s while working on ''[[The Simpsons]]''; he brought [[David X.

Recurring guest stars included [[Dawnn Lewis]] (as Hermes' wife [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#LaBarbara Conrad|LaBarbara]]), [[Tom Kenny]], [[Dan Castellaneta]] (as [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Robot Devil|the Robot Devil]]), [[Al Gore]], and [[George Takei]], among others.\n\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===Animation===\n[[File:FuturamaExplosionCGI.jpg|thumb|Computer-generated explosion]]\n[[Rough Draft Studios]] animated ''Futurama''. The studio would receive the completed script of an episode and create a [[storyboard]] consisting of more than 100 drawings. It would then produce a pencil-drawn [[Animatics|animatic]] with 1,000 frames. Rough Draft's sister studio in South Korea would render the 30,000-frame finished episode.<ref name=\"Needham\" />\n\nIn addition to traditional cartoon drawing, Rough Draft Studios often used [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for fast or complex shots, such as the movement of [[Spacecraft|spaceships]], explosions, [[nebula]]e, large crowds, and snow scenes. The opening sequence was entirely rendered in CGI. The CGI was rendered at 24 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] (as opposed to hand-drawn often done at 12 frames per second) and the lack of [[Digital artifact|artifacts]] made the animation appear very smooth and fluid. CGI characters looked slightly different due to spatially \"cheating\" hand-drawn characters by drawing slightly out of proportion or off-perspective features to emphasize traits of the face or body, improving legibility of an expression. [[PowerAnimator]] was used to draw the comic-like CGI.<ref name=\"Scott Vanzo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.peelified.com/Futurama-Forum-1/Topic-520-0-D_Animation_in_Futurama.html|title=Scott Vanzo of Rough Draft Studios e-mail response|accessdate=June 20, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216142456/http://www.peelified.com/Futurama-Forum-1/Topic-520-0-D_Animation_in_Futurama.html|archive-date=December 16, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe series began high-definition production in [[Futurama (season 5)|season 5]], with ''[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score|Bender's Big Score]]''.

She occasionally launches insidious plans for world domination and corporate takeover. She has a romantic history with the Professor which left her bitter and resentful. She has three bumbling sons, Walt, Larry, and Igner (modeled after [[The Three Stooges]]), who do her bidding despite frequent abuse, and often infuriate her with their incompetence. In ''[[Futurama: Bender's Game|Bender's Game]]'', it is revealed that Igner's father is Professor Farnsworth.\n*[[List of recurring Futurama characters#Nibbler|Nibbler]] ([[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Nibbler is Leela's pet Nibblonian, whom she rescues from an imploding planet and adopts in the episode \"[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]\". Despite his deceptively cute exterior, Nibbler is actually a highly intelligent super-being whose race is responsible for maintaining order in the universe. He is revealed in \"[[The Why of Fry]]\" to have been directly responsible for Fry's [[cryonics|cryogenics freezing]]. While the size of an average house cat, his race is capable of devouring much larger animals. He [[defecation|defecates]] [[dark matter]], which until ''Bender's Game'' is used as fuel for space cruisers in the series.\n\n==Setting ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\n''Futurama'' is set in New New York at the turn of the 31st century, in a time filled with technological wonders. The city of New New York has been built over the ruins of present-day New York City, which has become a catacomb-like space that acts as New New York's sewer, referred to as \"Old New York\". Various devices and architecture are similar to the [[Googie architecture|Populuxe]] style. [[Global warming]], inflexible [[bureaucracy]], and [[substance abuse]] are a few of the subjects given a 31st-century exaggeration in a world where the problems have become both more extreme and more common. Just as New York has become a more extreme version of itself in the future, other Earth locations are given the same treatment; Los Angeles, for example, is depicted as a smog-filled apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nNumerous technological advances have been made between the present day and the 31st century. The Head Museum, which keeps a collection of heads [[isolated brain|alive in jars]] and was invented by [[Ron Popeil]] (who has a guest cameo in \"[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]\"), has resulted in many historical figures and current celebrities being present, including Groening himself; this became the writers' device to feature and poke fun at contemporary celebrities in the show. Several of the preserved heads shown are those of people who were already dead well before the advent of this technology; one of the most prominent examples of this anomaly is Earth president [[Richard Nixon]], who died in 1994 and appears in numerous episodes. The Internet, while being fully immersive and encompassing all senses\u2014even featuring its own digital world (similar to ''[[Tron]]'' or ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'')\u2014is slow and largely consists of pornography, [[pop-up ad]]s, and \"filthy\" (or Filthy Filthy) [[chat room]]s. Some of it is edited to include educational material ostensibly for youth. Television is still a primary form of entertainment. Self-aware robots are a common sight, and are the main cause of global warming thanks to the exhaust from their [[ethanol fuel|alcohol-powered]] systems. The wheel is obsolete (no one but Fry even seems to recognize the design),<ref name=\"MothersDay\">{{cite episode | title=Mother's Day | episodelink=Mother's Day (Futurama) | series=Futurama | network=Fox Network | airdate=May 14, 2000 | season=2 | number=14}}</ref> having been forgotten and replaced by [[Hovercar|hover cars]] and a network of large, clear [[Pneumatic tube|pneumatic transportation tubes]].\n\nEnvironmentally, common animals still remain, alongside mutated, cross-bred (sometimes with humans) and extraterrestrial animals. Ironically, spotted owls are often shown to have replaced rats as common household pests. Although rats still exist, sometimes rats act like pigeons, though pigeons still exist, as well. Pine trees, anchovies and poodles have been extinct for 800 years. Earth still suffers the effects of [[greenhouse gas]]es, although in [[Xmas Story|one episode]] Leela states that its effects have been counteracted by [[nuclear winter]]. In another episode, the [[effects of global warming]] have been somewhat mitigated by the dropping of a giant ice cube into the ocean, and later by pushing Earth farther away from the sun, which also extended the year by one week.\n\nReligion is a prominent part of society, although the dominant religions have evolved. A merging of the [[major religious groups]] of the 20th century has resulted in the First Amalgamated Church,<ref name=\"Gospel\">{{cite book |last=Pinsky |first=Mark |title=The Gospel According to the Simpsons.

New religions include [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprahism]], [[Religion in Futurama|Robotology]], and the banned religion of [[Trekkie|''Star Trek'' fandom]]. Religious figures include [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Father Changstein-El-Gamal|Father Changstein-El-Gamal]], the [[Robot Devil]], [[Reverend Lionel Preacherbot]], and passing references to the Space Pope, who appears to be a large crocodile-like creature. Several major holidays have robots associated with them, including the murderous Robot Santa and Kwanzaa-bot. While very few episodes focus exclusively on religion within the ''Futurama'' universe, they do cover a wide variety of subjects including predestination, prayer, the nature of salvation, and religious conversion.<ref name=\"Gospel\" />\n\n''Futurama''{{'}}s setting is a backdrop, and the writers are not above committing [[Continuity error|continuity errors]] if they serve to further the gags. For example, while [[Space Pilot 3000|the pilot episode]] implies that the previous Planet Express crew was killed by a space wasp, the later episode \"[[The Sting (Futurama)|The Sting]]\" is based on the crew having been killed by space bees instead.<ref name=\"Verrone\">[[Patric Verrone|Verrone, Patric M]] (2003), DVD commentary for \"The Sting\", ''Futurama''.

Most episodes in [[Futurama (season 6)|Season 6]] use an [[Abridgement|abridged]] opening sequence, omitting the brief clip of a classic cartoon. \"[[That Darn Katz!]]\", \"[[Benderama]]\" and \"[[Yo Leela Leela]]\" have been the only episodes since \"[[Spanish Fry]]\" to feature a classic cartoon clip. Several episodes begin with a cold opening before the opening sequence, although these scenes do not always correspond with the episode's plot. The opening sequence has been lampooned several times within the show, in episodes including \"[[That's Lobstertainment!]]\", \"[[The Problem with Popplers]]\", as \"''Future-roma''\" in \"[[The Duh-Vinci Code]]\" and as \"''Futurella''\" in \"[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]\".\n\nSeries director Scott Vanzo has remarked on the difficulty of animating the sequence. It took four to five weeks to fully animate the sequence, and it consists of over 80 levels of [[Computer animation|3D animation]] composited together.<ref name=1ACV04OpeningSequence1>{{cite video|people=Cohen, David X.; Groening, Matt; Kelley, Brian; Sheesley, Brian; Moore, Rich; Vanzo, Scott; DiMaggio, John|year=2002|title=Futurama: Volume One DVD commentary for the episode \"[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|quote='''Scott Vanzo:''' The final is kinda difficult for us to create, it has over 80 levels of 3D animation that are composited together, a lot of cheats, probably the single biggest scene that we have ever done, or at least we view it as a scene, so...

In ''[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|The Beast with a Billion Backs]]'' and ''[[Futurama: Bender's Game|Bender's Game]]'' the ship passes through the screen's glass and temporarily becomes part of the environment depicted therein\u2014a pastiche of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' and ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' respectively\u2014before crashing through the screen glass on the way out. In ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder|Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'', a completely different opening sequence involves a trip through a futuristic version of Las Vegas located on Mars. The theme tune is sung by [[Seth MacFarlane]] and is different from the standard theme tune. The end of the film incorporates a unique variation of the opening sequence; as the ''Planet Express Ship'' enters a wormhole, it converts into a pattern of lights similar to the lights that appear in the opening sequence.\n\nThe ''Futurama'' theme was created by [[Christopher Tyng]]. The theme is played on the [[tubular bells]] but is occasionally remixed for use in specific episodes, including a version by the [[Beastie Boys]] used for the episode \"[[Hell Is Other Robots]]\", in which they guest starred.<ref name=\"Azrai\" /> The theme also samples a [[Amen break|drum break originating from \"Amen, Brother\"]] by American soul group [[The Winstons]]; however, the drum break is replaced in Season 6. A remixed rendition of the theme is used in Season 5, which features altered instruments and a lower pitch. Season 6 also uses this remix, but it has been reduced again in pitch and tempo.

The series follows the adventures of slacker [[Philip J. Fry]], who is [[cryonics|cryogenically preserved]] for 1000 years and is revived in the 31st century.

Rough Draft's sister studio in South Korea would render the 30,000-frame finished episode.<ref name=\"Needham\" />\n\nIn addition to traditional cartoon drawing, Rough Draft Studios often used [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for fast or complex shots, such as the movement of [[Spacecraft|spaceships]], explosions, [[nebula]]e, large crowds, and snow scenes. The opening sequence was entirely rendered in CGI. The CGI was rendered at 24 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] (as opposed to hand-drawn often done at 12 frames per second) and the lack of [[Digital artifact|artifacts]] made the animation appear very smooth and fluid. CGI characters looked slightly different due to spatially \"cheating\" hand-drawn characters by drawing slightly out of proportion or off-perspective features to emphasize traits of the face or body, improving legibility of an expression. [[PowerAnimator]] was used to draw the comic-like CGI.<ref name=\"Scott Vanzo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.peelified.com/Futurama-Forum-1/Topic-520-0-D_Animation_in_Futurama.html|title=Scott Vanzo of Rough Draft Studios e-mail response|accessdate=June 20, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216142456/http://www.peelified.com/Futurama-Forum-1/Topic-520-0-D_Animation_in_Futurama.html|archive-date=December 16, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe series began high-definition production in [[Futurama (season 5)|season 5]], with ''[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score|Bender's Big Score]]''.

She occasionally launches insidious plans for world domination and corporate takeover. She has a romantic history with the Professor which left her bitter and resentful. She has three bumbling sons, Walt, Larry, and Igner (modeled after [[The Three Stooges]]), who do her bidding despite frequent abuse, and often infuriate her with their incompetence.

While the size of an average house cat, his race is capable of devouring much larger animals. He [[defecation|defecates]] [[dark matter]], which until ''Bender's Game'' is used as fuel for space cruisers in the series.\n\n==Setting ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\n''Futurama'' is set in New New York at the turn of the 31st century, in a time filled with technological wonders. The city of New New York has been built over the ruins of present-day New York City, which has become a catacomb-like space that acts as New New York's sewer, referred to as \"Old New York\". Various devices and architecture are similar to the [[Googie architecture|Populuxe]] style. [[Global warming]], inflexible [[bureaucracy]], and [[substance abuse]] are a few of the subjects given a 31st-century exaggeration in a world where the problems have become both more extreme and more common. Just as New York has become a more extreme version of itself in the future, other Earth locations are given the same treatment; Los Angeles, for example, is depicted as a smog-filled apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nNumerous technological advances have been made between the present day and the 31st century. The Head Museum, which keeps a collection of heads [[isolated brain|alive in jars]] and was invented by [[Ron Popeil]] (who has a guest cameo in \"[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]\"), has resulted in many historical figures and current celebrities being present, including Groening himself; this became the writers' device to feature and poke fun at contemporary celebrities in the show. Several of the preserved heads shown are those of people who were already dead well before the advent of this technology; one of the most prominent examples of this anomaly is Earth president [[Richard Nixon]], who died in 1994 and appears in numerous episodes. The Internet, while being fully immersive and encompassing all senses\u2014even featuring its own digital world (similar to ''[[Tron]]'' or ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'')\u2014is slow and largely consists of pornography, [[pop-up ad]]s, and \"filthy\" (or Filthy Filthy) [[chat room]]s. Some of it is edited to include educational material ostensibly for youth. Television is still a primary form of entertainment. Self-aware robots are a common sight, and are the main cause of global warming thanks to the exhaust from their [[ethanol fuel|alcohol-powered]] systems. The wheel is obsolete (no one but Fry even seems to recognize the design),<ref name=\"MothersDay\">{{cite episode | title=Mother's Day | episodelink=Mother's Day (Futurama) | series=Futurama | network=Fox Network | airdate=May 14, 2000 | season=2 | number=14}}</ref> having been forgotten and replaced by [[Hovercar|hover cars]] and a network of large, clear [[Pneumatic tube|pneumatic transportation tubes]].\n\nEnvironmentally, common animals still remain, alongside mutated, cross-bred (sometimes with humans) and extraterrestrial animals. Ironically, spotted owls are often shown to have replaced rats as common household pests. Although rats still exist, sometimes rats act like pigeons, though pigeons still exist, as well. Pine trees, anchovies and poodles have been extinct for 800 years. Earth still suffers the effects of [[greenhouse gas]]es, although in [[Xmas Story|one episode]] Leela states that its effects have been counteracted by [[nuclear winter]]. In another episode, the [[effects of global warming]] have been somewhat mitigated by the dropping of a giant ice cube into the ocean, and later by pushing Earth farther away from the sun, which also extended the year by one week.\n\nReligion is a prominent part of society, although the dominant religions have evolved. A merging of the [[major religious groups]] of the 20th century has resulted in the First Amalgamated Church,<ref name=\"Gospel\">{{cite book |last=Pinsky |first=Mark |title=The Gospel According to the Simpsons.

New religions include [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprahism]], [[Religion in Futurama|Robotology]], and the banned religion of [[Trekkie|''Star Trek'' fandom]]. Religious figures include [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Father Changstein-El-Gamal|Father Changstein-El-Gamal]], the [[Robot Devil]], [[Reverend Lionel Preacherbot]], and passing references to the Space Pope, who appears to be a large crocodile-like creature.

Several episodes begin with a cold opening before the opening sequence, although these scenes do not always correspond with the episode's plot.

In ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder|Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'', a completely different opening sequence involves a trip through a futuristic version of Las Vegas located on Mars. The theme tune is sung by [[Seth MacFarlane]] and is different from the standard theme tune. The end of the film incorporates a unique variation of the opening sequence; as the ''Planet Express Ship'' enters a wormhole, it converts into a pattern of lights similar to the lights that appear in the opening sequence.\n\nThe ''Futurama'' theme was created by [[Christopher Tyng]]. The theme is played on the [[tubular bells]] but is occasionally remixed for use in specific episodes, including a version by the [[Beastie Boys]] used for the episode \"[[Hell Is Other Robots]]\", in which they guest starred.<ref name=\"Azrai\" /> The theme also samples a [[Amen break|drum break originating from \"Amen, Brother\"]] by American soul group [[The Winstons]]; however, the drum break is replaced in Season 6. A remixed rendition of the theme is used in Season 5, which features altered instruments and a lower pitch. Season 6 also uses this remix, but it has been reduced again in pitch and tempo.

They are often found growing on wood, and when on the ground have a preference for mossy habitats. This group is most noted for toxic species which are occasionally confused with hallucinogenic species of ''[[Psilocybe]]''.\n\n''Galerina'' means ''helmet-like''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5HGMPEiy4ykC&pg=PA34 Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians] by William C. Roody</ref>\n\n==Taxonomic definition==\nThe genus ''Galerina'' is defined as small mushrooms of [[wikt:mycenoid|mycenoid]] stature, that is, roughly similar in form to ''[[Mycena]]'' species: a small conical to bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] attached to a long and slender cartilaginous [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].  Species have a [[pileipellis]] that is a cutis, and ornamented spores that are brown in deposit, where the spore ornamentation comes from an extra spore covering.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Galerina patagonica 5927.jpg|thumb|left|Galerina sp. Marriott Falls Track, Tasmania, Australia]]\n''Galerina'' [[fruiting body|fruiting bodies]] are typically small, undistinguished mushrooms with a typical \"[[Mushroom hunting#.22Little brown mushrooms.22|little brown mushroom]]\" morphology and a yellow-brown, light brown to cinnamon-brown [[spore print]]. The [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] is typically [[Glossary of botanical terms#glabrous|glabrous]] and often [[hygrophanous]], and a [[Partial veil|cortina]]-type veil is present in young specimens of roughly half of recognized species, though it sometimes disappears as the mushroom ages in many of these species. Microscopically, they are highly variable as well, though most species have [[spores]] that are ornamented, lack a germ pore, and have a [[plage (mycology)|plage]]. Many species also have characteristic [[wiktionary:tibiiform|tibiiform]] [[cystidia]]. However, there are many exceptions, and many species of ''Galerina'' lack one or more of these microscopic characteristics. Ecologically, all ''Galerina'' are [[saprobic]], growing in habitats like rotting wood or in moss.<ref name=\"Gulden\"/>\n\nThe spores of ''Galerina'' feature an ornamentation that comes from the outer layer of the spore breaking up on maturity to produce either warts, wrinkles or \"ears\", flaps of material loosened from where the spore was attached to the [[basidia]].  This outer layer of the spore often is not complete, but has a clear patch in many species just above the attachment, this clear patch is called a [[plage (mycology)|plage]].  This plage is not evident in all species, and the spore covering does not always breakup in all species, making it sometimes difficult to correctly determine a mushroom of this genus.\n\nThe specific features that define the genus require a microscope to confirm.  In the wild it can be difficult to determine a ''Galerina'' from a number of similar genera, such as ''[[Pholiota]]'', ''[[Tubaria]]'', ''[[Conocybe]]'', ''[[Pholiotina]]'', ''[[Agrocybe]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus]]'', ''[[Phaeogalera]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe]]''.  For the most part, Galerinas will be found associated with [[moss]], and this can separate out the genus in nature fairly well.  But this identification is more difficult in the section Naucoriopsis, which does not associate with moss, and is a decomposer of wood.\n\n''[[Phaeogalera]]'' is a genus that was segregated from ''Galerina'' by K\u00fchner.<ref name=\"Kuhner\"/>\n\n==Phylogenetics==\n''Galerina'' has recently been found to be [[polyphyletic]],<ref name=\"Gulden\"/> consisting of at least three unrelated [[clades]], although not all species were studied and for most currently recognized species is uncertain still in which they belong.

''Galerina'' can be distinguished from psilocybin ''Psilocybe'' by the following characteristics:\n\n*[[Spore print]] color: blackish-brown to lilac-brown in ''Psilocybe'', light brown to rusty brown in ''Galerina''. Spore color can be seen by taking a spore print or by looking for evidence of spore drop on the stipe or on surrounding mushrooms.\n*Staining reaction: Psilocybin ''Psilocybe'' [[fruiting bodies]] stain blue to varying degrees when bruised, while ''Galerina'' do not.

They are often found growing on wood, and when on the ground have a preference for mossy habitats. This group is most noted for toxic species which are occasionally confused with hallucinogenic species of ''[[Psilocybe]]''.\n\n''Galerina'' means ''helmet-like''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5HGMPEiy4ykC&pg=PA34 Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians] by William C. Roody</ref>\n\n==Taxonomic definition==\nThe genus ''Galerina'' is defined as small mushrooms of [[wikt:mycenoid|mycenoid]] stature, that is, roughly similar in form to ''[[Mycena]]'' species: a small conical to bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] attached to a long and slender cartilaginous [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].  Species have a [[pileipellis]] that is a cutis, and ornamented spores that are brown in deposit, where the spore ornamentation comes from an extra spore covering.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Galerina patagonica 5927.jpg|thumb|left|Galerina sp. Marriott Falls Track, Tasmania, Australia]]\n''Galerina'' [[fruiting body|fruiting bodies]] are typically small, undistinguished mushrooms with a typical \"[[Mushroom hunting#.22Little brown mushrooms.22|little brown mushroom]]\" morphology and a yellow-brown, light brown to cinnamon-brown [[spore print]]. The [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] is typically [[Glossary of botanical terms#glabrous|glabrous]] and often [[hygrophanous]], and a [[Partial veil|cortina]]-type veil is present in young specimens of roughly half of recognized species, though it sometimes disappears as the mushroom ages in many of these species. Microscopically, they are highly variable as well, though most species have [[spores]] that are ornamented, lack a germ pore, and have a [[plage (mycology)|plage]]. Many species also have characteristic [[wiktionary:tibiiform|tibiiform]] [[cystidia]]. However, there are many exceptions, and many species of ''Galerina'' lack one or more of these microscopic characteristics. Ecologically, all ''Galerina'' are [[saprobic]], growing in habitats like rotting wood or in moss.<ref name=\"Gulden\"/>\n\nThe spores of ''Galerina'' feature an ornamentation that comes from the outer layer of the spore breaking up on maturity to produce either warts, wrinkles or \"ears\", flaps of material loosened from where the spore was attached to the [[basidia]].  This outer layer of the spore often is not complete, but has a clear patch in many species just above the attachment, this clear patch is called a [[plage (mycology)|plage]].  This plage is not evident in all species, and the spore covering does not always breakup in all species, making it sometimes difficult to correctly determine a mushroom of this genus.\n\nThe specific features that define the genus require a microscope to confirm.  In the wild it can be difficult to determine a ''Galerina'' from a number of similar genera, such as ''[[Pholiota]]'', ''[[Tubaria]]'', ''[[Conocybe]]'', ''[[Pholiotina]]'', ''[[Agrocybe]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus]]'', ''[[Phaeogalera]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe]]''.  For the most part, Galerinas will be found associated with [[moss]], and this can separate out the genus in nature fairly well.  But this identification is more difficult in the section Naucoriopsis, which does not associate with moss, and is a decomposer of wood.\n\n''[[Phaeogalera]]'' is a genus that was segregated from ''Galerina'' by K\u00fchner.<ref name=\"Kuhner\"/>\n\n==Phylogenetics==\n''Galerina'' has recently been found to be [[polyphyletic]],<ref name=\"Gulden\"/> consisting of at least three unrelated [[clades]], although not all species were studied and for most currently recognized species is uncertain still in which they belong.  Each of these clades corresponds to a subgenus of ''Galerina'', as outlined by K\u00fchner.<ref name=\"Kuhner\">{{cite journal |author=K\u00fchner R. |year=1972|title=Agaricales de la zone alpine: Genres ''Galera'' Earle et ''Phaeogalera'' gen. nov |journal=Bulletin Trimestriel de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mycologique de France |volume=88 |pages=41\u2013153}}</ref> The great diversity of [[wikt:micromorphology|micromorphology]] found in ''Galerina'' is probably due to the [[polyphyly]] of the genus.\n\n==Chemistry and toxicology==\nMany (though not all) ''Galerina'' contain [[alpha-amanitin]] and other [[amatoxins]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Enjalbert F, Cassanas G, Rapior S, Renault C, Chaumont JP |year=2004 |url=http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/subnamed/pdf/rapior/Rapior2004Mycologia.pdf |format=PDF |title=Amatoxins in wood-rotting ''Galerina marginata'' |journal=Mycologia |volume=96 |pages=720\u2013729 |doi=10.2307/3762106 |issue=4 |jstor=3762106 |pmid=21148893 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718164412/http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/subnamed/pdf/rapior/Rapior2004Mycologia.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-18 |df= }}</ref> ''Galerina steglichii'' is very rare, bruises blue and contains the hallucinogen [[psilocybin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gartz J. |year=1995 |url=http://leda.lycaeum.org/?ID=10423 |title=Cultivation and analysis of ''Psilocybe'' species and an investigation of ''Galerina steglichi'' |journal=Annali Museo Civico di Rovereto |volume=10 |pages=297\u2013306 |access-date=2007-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726074127/http://leda.lycaeum.org/?ID=10423 |archive-date=2013-07-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Besl H. |year= 1993 |title=''Galerina steglichii'' spec. nov, ein halluzinogener Haeubling |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mykologie |volume=59 |pages=215\u2013218}}</ref>\n\n{{mycomorphbox\n| name = Galerina sp.\n| whichGills = adnexed\n| capShape = convex\n| hymeniumType=gills\n| stipeCharacter=ring\n| stipeCharacter2=bare\n| ecologicalType=saprotrophic\n| sporePrintColor=yellow-orange\n| sporePrintColor2= brown\n| howEdible=deadly\n}}\n\n==Identification==\nThe extreme toxicity of some ''Galerina'' species means that recognition of ''Galerina'' is of great importance to [[mushroom hunters]] who are seeking hallucinogenic ''Psilocybe'' mushrooms.

''Galerina'' can be distinguished from psilocybin ''Psilocybe'' by the following characteristics:\n\n*[[Spore print]] color: blackish-brown to lilac-brown in ''Psilocybe'', light brown to rusty brown in ''Galerina''. Spore color can be seen by taking a spore print or by looking for evidence of spore drop on the stipe or on surrounding mushrooms.\n*Staining reaction: Psilocybin ''Psilocybe'' [[fruiting bodies]] stain blue to varying degrees when bruised, while ''Galerina'' do not.

After graduating from the Academy, he became a teacher there and began his career as a composer in 1959 during the [[Warsaw Autumn]] festival. His ''Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima'' for [[string orchestra]] and the choral work ''St. Luke Passion'' have received popular acclaim. His first opera, ''[[The Devils of Loudun (opera)|The Devils of Loudun]]'', was not immediately successful. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Penderecki's composing style changed, with his first violin concerto focusing on the [[semitone]] and the [[tritone]]. His choral work ''Polish Requiem'' was written in the 1980s and expanded in 1993 and 2005.\n\nPenderecki won many prestigious awards, including the [[Prix Italia]] in 1967 and 1968; four [[Grammy Award]]s in 1987, 1998 (twice), and 2017; the [[Wolf Prize in Arts]] in 1987; and the [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award (Music Composition)|Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition]] in 1992.<ref name=grawemeyer.org>{{Cite web|url=http://grawemeyer.org/1992-krzysztof-penderecki/|title=1992 \u2013 Krzysztof Penderecki \u2013 Grawemeyer Awards|website=Grawemeyer.org}}</ref> In 2012, [[Sean Michaels (writer)|Sean Michaels]] of ''The Guardian'' called him \"arguably Poland's greatest living composer\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/23/jonny-greenwood-krzysztof-penderecki?newsfeed=true | work=The Guardian | first=Sean | last=Michaels | title=Jonny Greenwood reveals details of Krzysztof Penderecki collaboration | date=23 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n===1933\u20131958: Early years===\nPenderecki was born on 23 November 1933 in [[D\u0119bica]], the son of Zofia and Tadeusz Penderecki, a lawyer.

Tadeusz was a [[violin]]ist and also played [[piano]].<ref name=\"Schwinger16\"/>\n\nIn 1939, the [[World War II|Second World War]] broke out, and Penderecki's family moved out of their apartment as the Ministry of Food was to operate there. After the war, Penderecki began attending [[grammar school]] in 1946. He began studying the violin under Stanis\u0142aw Dar\u0142ak, D\u0119bica's military bandmaster who organized an orchestra for the local music society after the war.<ref name=\"Schwinger17\">Schwinger, p. 17.</ref> Upon graduating from grammar school, Penderecki moved to Krak\u00f3w in 1951, where he attended [[Jagiellonian University]].<ref name=\"Schwinger17\"/> He studied violin with Stanis\u0142aw Tawroszewicz and music theory with Franciszek Sko\u0142yszewski.<ref name=\"Schwinger18\">Schwinger, p. 18.</ref> In 1954, Penderecki entered the [[Academy of Music in Krak\u00f3w]] and, having finished his studies on violin after his first year, focused entirely on composition. Penderecki's main teacher there was Artur Malawski, a composer known for his choral and orchestral works, as well as chamber music and songs. After Malawski's death in 1957, Penderecki took further lessons with [[Stanis\u0142aw Wiechowicz]], a composer primarily known for his choral works.<ref name=\"Schwinger18&19\">Schwinger, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> At the time, the 1956 overthrow of [[Stalinism]] in Poland lifted strict cultural censorship and opened the door to a wave of creativity.<ref name=\"LOC1\">{{cite journal |last =Monastra |first =Peggy |title =Krzysztof Penderecki's Polymorphia and Fluorescences |journal = Moldenhauer Archives, Library of Congress |url =http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/moldenhauer/2428143.pdf | accessdate = 19 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===1958\u20131970s: First compositions===\nOn graduating from the Academy of Music in Krak\u00f3w in 1958, Penderecki took up a teaching post at the Academy. His early works show the influence of [[Anton Webern]] and [[Pierre Boulez]] (Penderecki was also influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]]). Penderecki's international recognition began in 1959 at the [[Warsaw Autumn]] with the premieres of the works ''Strophen'', ''Psalms of David'', and ''Emanations'', but the piece that truly brought him to international attention was ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]'' (see [[threnody]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]]), written in 1960 for 52 [[string instrument]]s. In it, he makes use of extended instrumental techniques (for example, playing behind the bridge, bowing on the tailpiece). There are many novel textures in the work, which makes extensive use of [[tone cluster]]s. He originally titled the work ''8' 37\"'', but decided to dedicate it to the victims of Hiroshima.<ref>Thomas (2008), p. 165</ref>\n\n''Fluorescences'' followed a year later; it increases the orchestral density with more wind and brass, and an enormous percussion section of 32 instruments for six players, including a Mexican g\u00fciro, typewriters, gongs and other unusual instruments. The piece was composed for the [[Donaueschingen Festival]] of contemporary music of 1962, and its performance was regarded as provocative and controversial. Even the score appeared revolutionary; the form of [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] that Penderecki had developed rejected the familiar look of notes on a staff, instead representing music as morphing sounds.<ref name=\"LOC1\" /> His intentions at this stage were quite [[John Cage|Cagean]]: \"All I'm interested in is liberating sound beyond all tradition.\"<ref name=\"liner\">{{cite web |last =Tomaszewski |first =Mieczyslaw |year =2000 |title =Orchestral Works Vol 1 Liner Notes |journal = |url =https://www.amazon.com/Penderecki-Orchestral-Works-Vol-01/dp/B00004D3II | accessdate = }}</ref> This preoccupation with sound culminated in ''De Natura Sonoris I'', which frequently calls upon the orchestra to use non-standard playing techniques to produce original sounds and colours. A sequel, ''De Natura Sonoris II'', was composed in 1971: with its more limited orchestra, it incorporates more elements of post-[[Romanticism]] than its predecessor. This foreshadowed Penderecki's renunciation of the avant-garde in the mid-1970s, although both pieces feature dramatic [[glissando]]s, dense clusters, use of harmonics, and unusual instruments (the [[musical saw]] features in the second piece).\n\nIn 1968 Penderecki received the State Prize 1st class.<ref>''Dziennik Polski'', rok XXIV, nr 172 (7599), p. 6.</ref> During the jubilee of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] he received the Commander's Cross (1974)<ref>Dziennik Polski, rok XXX, nr 175 (9456), p. 2.</ref> and Knight's Cross of [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] (1964).<ref>Dziennik Polski, rok XX, nr 171 (6363), p. 6.</ref>\n\n===''The St. Luke Passion''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!'''Year''' || '''Song title'''   || '''Work'''  || '''Instrumentation'''\n|-\n| 1968:\n| \"Miserere mei, Deus\"<br />''{{audio|Krzysztof Penderecki Miserere mei-Deus.ogg|Listen}}''\n|| Saint Luke Passion\n|| Chorus\n|}\n\nThe large-scale ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1963\u201366) brought Penderecki further popular acclaim, not least because it was devoutly religious, yet written in an avant-garde musical language, composed within Communist Eastern Europe. Western audiences saw it as a snub to the Soviet authorities. Various different musical styles can be seen in the piece. The experimental textures, such as were employed in the ''Threnody'', are balanced by the work's [[Baroque music|Baroque]] form and the occasional use of more traditional [[harmony|harmonic]] and [[melody|melodic]] writing. Penderecki makes use of [[serialism]] in this piece, and one of the tone rows he uses includes the [[BACH motif]], which acts as a bridge between the conventional and more experimental elements. The [[Stabat Mater#Musical settings|Stabat Mater]] section toward the end of the piece concludes on a simple [[chord (music)|chord]] of D major, and this gesture is repeated at the very end of the work, which finishes on a triumphant E major chord. These are the only tonal harmonies in the work, and both come as a surprise to the listener; Penderecki's use of tonal triads such as these remains a controversial aspect of the work.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walter |first=Meinrad |date=2002 |title=Avantgarde mit menschlichem Antlitz |url=https://www.herder.de/hk/hefte/archiv/2002/10-2002/avantgarde-mit-menschlichem-antlitz-ein-portraet-des-komponisten-und-guardini-preistraegers-krzysztof-penderecki/ |journal=Herder Korrespondenz |volume=2002 |issue=10 |pages=507\u2013512 |doi= |language=de |access-date=29 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nPenderecki continued to write pieces that explored the sacred in music. In the early 1970s he wrote a [[Dies irae]], a [[Magnificat]], and [[Canticum Canticorum Salomonis]] ([[Song of Songs]]) for chorus and orchestra.<ref name=\"liner\"/>\n\n===1970s\u20132020: Later years===\nIn the mid-1970s, while he was a professor at the [[Yale School of Music]],<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Biography on Krakow 2000 | url = http://www.biurofestiwalowe.pl/wydarzenia/kpenderecki_98/penderecki_a.html|website=Biurofestiwalowe.pl | accessdate = 30 April 2007 }}</ref> Penderecki's style began to change. The [[Violin Concerto]] No. 1 largely leaves behind the dense tone clusters with which he had been associated, and instead focuses on two [[melody|melodic]] intervals: the [[semitone]] and the [[tritone]]. This direction continued with the [[Symphony No. 2 (Penderecki)|Symphony No. 2, ''Christmas'']] (1980), which is harmonically and melodically quite straightforward. It makes frequent use of the tune of the [[Christmas carol]] ''[[Silent Night (song)|Silent Night]]''.\n\nPenderecki explained this shift by stating that he had come to feel that the experimentation of the avant-garde had gone too far from the expressive, non-formal qualities of Western music: \"The avant-garde gave one an illusion of universalism. The musical world of [[Stockhausen]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Nono]], Boulez and Cage was for us, the young \u2013 hemmed in by the aesthetics of socialist realism, then the official canon in our country \u2013 a liberation...I was quick to realise however, that this novelty, this experimentation, and formal speculation, is more destructive than constructive; I realised the Utopian quality of its Promethean tone.\" Penderecki concluded that he was \"saved from the avant-garde snare of formalism by a return to tradition\".<ref name=\"liner\"/> Penderecki has written relatively little chamber music. However, compositions for smaller ensembles range in date from the start of his career to the end, reflecting the changes his style of writing has undergone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naxos.com/person/Krzysztof_Penderecki_21188/21188.htm|title=Krzysztof Penderecki- Bio, Albums, Pictures \u2013 Naxos Classical Music.|website=Naxos.com|access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Penderecki was commissioned by [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] to compose a piece to accompany the unveiling of a statue at the [[Gda\u0144sk]] shipyards to commemorate those killed in anti-government riots there in 1970. Penderecki responded with ''Lacrimosa'', which he later expanded into one of the best-known works of his later period, the ''[[Polish Requiem]]'' (1980\u201384, 1993, 2005). Later, he tended towards more traditionally conceived tonal constructs, as heard in works such as the Cello Concerto No. 2 and the [[Credo (Penderecki)|Credo]], which received the [[Grammy Award]] for best choral performance for the world-premiere recording made by the [[Oregon Bach Festival]], which commissioned the piece. The same year, Penderecki was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Prize]] in Spain, one of the highest honours given in Spain to individuals, entities, organizations or others from around the world who make notable achievements in the sciences, arts, humanities, or public affairs. Invited by [[Walter Fink]], he was the eleventh composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenportr\u00e4t]] of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2001. He conducted the Credo on the occasion of the 70th birthday of [[Helmuth Rilling]], 29 May 2003.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040057/http://www.helmuth-rilling.de/programm.htm Benefizkonzert zum 70.

His ''Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima'' for [[string orchestra]] and the choral work ''St. Luke Passion'' have received popular acclaim. His first opera, ''[[The Devils of Loudun (opera)|The Devils of Loudun]]'', was not immediately successful. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Penderecki's composing style changed, with his first violin concerto focusing on the [[semitone]] and the [[tritone]].

After the war, Penderecki began attending [[grammar school]] in 1946. He began studying the violin under Stanis\u0142aw Dar\u0142ak, D\u0119bica's military bandmaster who organized an orchestra for the local music society after the war.<ref name=\"Schwinger17\">Schwinger, p. 17.</ref> Upon graduating from grammar school, Penderecki moved to Krak\u00f3w in 1951, where he attended [[Jagiellonian University]].<ref name=\"Schwinger17\"/> He studied violin with Stanis\u0142aw Tawroszewicz and music theory with Franciszek Sko\u0142yszewski.<ref name=\"Schwinger18\">Schwinger, p. 18.</ref> In 1954, Penderecki entered the [[Academy of Music in Krak\u00f3w]] and, having finished his studies on violin after his first year, focused entirely on composition. Penderecki's main teacher there was Artur Malawski, a composer known for his choral and orchestral works, as well as chamber music and songs.

His early works show the influence of [[Anton Webern]] and [[Pierre Boulez]] (Penderecki was also influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]]). Penderecki's international recognition began in 1959 at the [[Warsaw Autumn]] with the premieres of the works ''Strophen'', ''Psalms of David'', and ''Emanations'', but the piece that truly brought him to international attention was ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]'' (see [[threnody]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]]), written in 1960 for 52 [[string instrument]]s. In it, he makes use of extended instrumental techniques (for example, playing behind the bridge, bowing on the tailpiece). There are many novel textures in the work, which makes extensive use of [[tone cluster]]s. He originally titled the work ''8' 37\"'', but decided to dedicate it to the victims of Hiroshima.<ref>Thomas (2008), p. 165</ref>\n\n''Fluorescences'' followed a year later; it increases the orchestral density with more wind and brass, and an enormous percussion section of 32 instruments for six players, including a Mexican g\u00fciro, typewriters, gongs and other unusual instruments. The piece was composed for the [[Donaueschingen Festival]] of contemporary music of 1962, and its performance was regarded as provocative and controversial. Even the score appeared revolutionary; the form of [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] that Penderecki had developed rejected the familiar look of notes on a staff, instead representing music as morphing sounds.<ref name=\"LOC1\" /> His intentions at this stage were quite [[John Cage|Cagean]]: \"All I'm interested in is liberating sound beyond all tradition.\"<ref name=\"liner\">{{cite web |last =Tomaszewski |first =Mieczyslaw |year =2000 |title =Orchestral Works Vol 1 Liner Notes |journal = |url =https://www.amazon.com/Penderecki-Orchestral-Works-Vol-01/dp/B00004D3II | accessdate = }}</ref> This preoccupation with sound culminated in ''De Natura Sonoris I'', which frequently calls upon the orchestra to use non-standard playing techniques to produce original sounds and colours. A sequel, ''De Natura Sonoris II'', was composed in 1971: with its more limited orchestra, it incorporates more elements of post-[[Romanticism]] than its predecessor. This foreshadowed Penderecki's renunciation of the avant-garde in the mid-1970s, although both pieces feature dramatic [[glissando]]s, dense clusters, use of harmonics, and unusual instruments (the [[musical saw]] features in the second piece).\n\nIn 1968 Penderecki received the State Prize 1st class.<ref>''Dziennik Polski'', rok XXIV, nr 172 (7599), p. 6.</ref> During the jubilee of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] he received the Commander's Cross (1974)<ref>Dziennik Polski, rok XXX, nr 175 (9456), p. 2.</ref> and Knight's Cross of [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] (1964).<ref>Dziennik Polski, rok XX, nr 171 (6363), p. 6.</ref>\n\n===''The St. Luke Passion''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!'''Year''' || '''Song title'''   || '''Work'''  || '''Instrumentation'''\n|-\n| 1968:\n| \"Miserere mei, Deus\"<br />''{{audio|Krzysztof Penderecki Miserere mei-Deus.ogg|Listen}}''\n|| Saint Luke Passion\n|| Chorus\n|}\n\nThe large-scale ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1963\u201366) brought Penderecki further popular acclaim, not least because it was devoutly religious, yet written in an avant-garde musical language, composed within Communist Eastern Europe. Western audiences saw it as a snub to the Soviet authorities. Various different musical styles can be seen in the piece. The experimental textures, such as were employed in the ''Threnody'', are balanced by the work's [[Baroque music|Baroque]] form and the occasional use of more traditional [[harmony|harmonic]] and [[melody|melodic]] writing. Penderecki makes use of [[serialism]] in this piece, and one of the tone rows he uses includes the [[BACH motif]], which acts as a bridge between the conventional and more experimental elements. The [[Stabat Mater#Musical settings|Stabat Mater]] section toward the end of the piece concludes on a simple [[chord (music)|chord]] of D major, and this gesture is repeated at the very end of the work, which finishes on a triumphant E major chord. These are the only tonal harmonies in the work, and both come as a surprise to the listener; Penderecki's use of tonal triads such as these remains a controversial aspect of the work.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walter |first=Meinrad |date=2002 |title=Avantgarde mit menschlichem Antlitz |url=https://www.herder.de/hk/hefte/archiv/2002/10-2002/avantgarde-mit-menschlichem-antlitz-ein-portraet-des-komponisten-und-guardini-preistraegers-krzysztof-penderecki/ |journal=Herder Korrespondenz |volume=2002 |issue=10 |pages=507\u2013512 |doi= |language=de |access-date=29 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nPenderecki continued to write pieces that explored the sacred in music. In the early 1970s he wrote a [[Dies irae]], a [[Magnificat]], and [[Canticum Canticorum Salomonis]] ([[Song of Songs]]) for chorus and orchestra.<ref name=\"liner\"/>\n\n===1970s\u20132020: Later years===\nIn the mid-1970s, while he was a professor at the [[Yale School of Music]],<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Biography on Krakow 2000 | url = http://www.biurofestiwalowe.pl/wydarzenia/kpenderecki_98/penderecki_a.html|website=Biurofestiwalowe.pl | accessdate = 30 April 2007 }}</ref> Penderecki's style began to change. The [[Violin Concerto]] No. 1 largely leaves behind the dense tone clusters with which he had been associated, and instead focuses on two [[melody|melodic]] intervals: the [[semitone]] and the [[tritone]]. This direction continued with the [[Symphony No. 2 (Penderecki)|Symphony No. 2, ''Christmas'']] (1980), which is harmonically and melodically quite straightforward. It makes frequent use of the tune of the [[Christmas carol]] ''[[Silent Night (song)|Silent Night]]''.\n\nPenderecki explained this shift by stating that he had come to feel that the experimentation of the avant-garde had gone too far from the expressive, non-formal qualities of Western music: \"The avant-garde gave one an illusion of universalism. The musical world of [[Stockhausen]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Nono]], Boulez and Cage was for us, the young \u2013 hemmed in by the aesthetics of socialist realism, then the official canon in our country \u2013 a liberation...I was quick to realise however, that this novelty, this experimentation, and formal speculation, is more destructive than constructive; I realised the Utopian quality of its Promethean tone.\" Penderecki concluded that he was \"saved from the avant-garde snare of formalism by a return to tradition\".<ref name=\"liner\"/> Penderecki has written relatively little chamber music. However, compositions for smaller ensembles range in date from the start of his career to the end, reflecting the changes his style of writing has undergone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naxos.com/person/Krzysztof_Penderecki_21188/21188.htm|title=Krzysztof Penderecki- Bio, Albums, Pictures \u2013 Naxos Classical Music.|website=Naxos.com|access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Penderecki was commissioned by [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] to compose a piece to accompany the unveiling of a statue at the [[Gda\u0144sk]] shipyards to commemorate those killed in anti-government riots there in 1970. Penderecki responded with ''Lacrimosa'', which he later expanded into one of the best-known works of his later period, the ''[[Polish Requiem]]'' (1980\u201384, 1993, 2005). Later, he tended towards more traditionally conceived tonal constructs, as heard in works such as the Cello Concerto No. 2 and the [[Credo (Penderecki)|Credo]], which received the [[Grammy Award]] for best choral performance for the world-premiere recording made by the [[Oregon Bach Festival]], which commissioned the piece. The same year, Penderecki was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Prize]] in Spain, one of the highest honours given in Spain to individuals, entities, organizations or others from around the world who make notable achievements in the sciences, arts, humanities, or public affairs. Invited by [[Walter Fink]], he was the eleventh composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenportr\u00e4t]] of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2001. He conducted the Credo on the occasion of the 70th birthday of [[Helmuth Rilling]], 29 May 2003.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040057/http://www.helmuth-rilling.de/programm.htm Benefizkonzert zum 70.
