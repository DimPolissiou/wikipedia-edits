In 1961, the office of the [[Postmaster-General's Department|Postmaster General]] (PMG) introduced the 000 number in major population centres and near the end of the 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number 000 was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the dialling system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an automatic trunk line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a main centre; thus dialling 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is also the closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones. This made it quick and easy to dial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |title=History of the Emergency Call Services |website=ACMA |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090515052220/http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |archive-date=15 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is now well established nationally throughout Australia that persons requiring emergency assistance dial 000.\n\n== Calling 000 ==\nWithin Australia, 000 is a free call from most telephones. Dialling 000 (or 112) on most Australian GSM mobile phones will override any keypad lock, and if the caller's home network is out of range, the phone will attempt to use other carriers' networks to relay the call. A [[SIM card]] is not required to connect a mobile phone to Emergency Services. Interpreter services may be available once connected to Emergency Services.\n\nDue to special configuration in their firmware, some [[3G]] or [[GSM]] mobile phones sold in Australia will redirect other emergency numbers, such as [[9-1-1]] and [[999 (emergency telephone number)|9-9-9]], to 000. These calls are sent out by the handset as an emergency flag to the network and as such are treated in the same way as a call to 000.\n\n== Answering ==\nExcept for Victoria (see below), calling 000 greets the caller with a recorded message stating \"You have dialed emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" then connects the caller to a [[Telstra]] operator who will then connect the caller to the emergency service organisation call taker. Telstra operators will ask the caller if they require \"Police, Fire, Ambulance?\", and their location if not calling from a phone with fixed location (landline). The caller is then connected to the emergency service requested by the caller.\n\nAs soon as the emergency service call taker answers the call, any available caller location information is transferred to the emergency service; however, the emergency service call taker will still question the caller to obtain correct location details in order to dispatch the correct response.\n\nThe caller's address is usually available to Telstra operators for fixed services in Australia even if the number is \"private\".

ESTA operates three State Emergency Communications Centres, located in the [[Melbourne]] CBD, [[East Burwood]], and [[Ballarat]].\n\nWhen a person calls 000 for emergency response within Victoria, the call is automatically directed to the relevant ESTA facility where it will be answered by the next available trained call taker, who will collect information from the caller, and enter this into the [[Computer Aided Dispatch]] (CAD) system. Using this information, a dispatcher will identify and dispatch the appropriate emergency services or resources. Emergency crews are often already being notified by the relevant services' dispatchers while the call taker is still obtaining further information or giving advice, such as guiding the caller through [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|CPR]], obtaining details of a possible offender, or receiving further details about the exact location or situation - an initial response may be made to details as vague as a town or suburb, while the call taker continues to get more specific location information.\n\nESTA is also responsible for Victorian [[State Emergency Service]] call-taking and dispatch, although this service cannot be contacted by dialling 000 as SES calls are not considered to be life-threatening. The number for SES calls is 132&nbsp;500, but police or another service dialled inappropriately will notify SES.\n\nMany ESTA practices and protocols are standardised across all emergency services agencies, and all agencies use the same computer network.

Owing to the unprecedented numbers of calls coming through, Telstra decided to isolate all Victorian emergency calls which were answered by the Melbourne emergency call centre with all the remaining calls answered by the Sydney emergency call centre. Telstra also activated the generic extreme event recorded voice announcement ''\"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero. If you require police, fire or ambulance please stay on the line.

Callers in a queue waiting for a Telstra agent to answer the phone were played an RVA every 30 seconds in the following terms, \"You have dialled the Emergency Triple Zero number. Due to an unprecedented high volume of calls being received by Triple Zero, we are experiencing short delays in answering.

Presently, operators must ask the caller exactly where they are. The answer to this may need to correspond to an existing road name (which may be practically impossible for distressed person(s) some kilometres away from a road) until the Emergency Service Organisation operator can dispatch an emergency service vehicle.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) began researching options that may provide improved location information for mobile services when dialing 000. \n\nIn 2013, an emergency service smartphone app was  produced and developed by [[Fire and Rescue NSW]] and the Triple Zero Awareness Working Group.<ref>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threesixtyentertainment.nesn</ref> Australians in remote locations are encouraged to use this app to contact emergency services as it uses phones GPS data to display the caller's location on the screen.

If you require your local State Emergency Service please hang up and dial 1223 \u2014 that\u2019s 1223 \u2014 as this service cannot be connected through Triple Zero\"'' which temporarily replaced their front end announcement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96781/20100923-0223/www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |format=PDF |page=293}}</ref> While Telstra records show 95 emergency call centre employees rostered during the 24-hour period on 7 February 2009, call pick up delays were evident due to lengthy delays at the SECC level, being ESTA. Telstra agents were left tied up on phone calls with callers, waiting for emergency services to answer, thus calls in the 000 queue were unable to be answered. Callers in a queue waiting for a Telstra agent to answer the phone were played an RVA every 30 seconds in the following terms, \"You have dialled the Emergency Triple Zero number. Due to an unprecedented high volume of calls being received by Triple Zero, we are experiencing short delays in answering. Please stay on the line and you will be answered by the next available operator\". This reassures callers that an extreme emergency was occurring and their call would be answered.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/index.php/component/content/article/22-html/867-2009-victorian-bushfires-royal-commission |title=Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission |website=Victoria Department of Premier and Cabinet|accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 2003 overload in Melbourne ===\nOn 3 December 2003, floods and storms in [[Melbourne]] caused a large influx of 000 calls, which prevented some calls from being answered immediately.

A subsequent investigation recommended that a temporary recorded announcement be implemented during extreme events to assure callers that their calls were being connected and a delay may occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/Document-data/Exhibits/WIT-5003-001-0151 |title=Telstra's handling of calls to 000 on the morning of 3 December 2003 |website=[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |date=February 2004 |page=28}}</ref> This is not to be confused with the standard \"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" RVA, which was introduced in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014|format=PDF |page=288}}</ref>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nEmergency services and Australia's communications regulator prefer the phrase \"triple zero\" over \"triple oh\" because of potential confusion and misunderstanding over keying the number when using alpha-numeric keypads, on which the letter \"O\" is typically located on the same key as the number \"6\".\n\n=== Remote locations ===\nOne major obstacle in earlier 2009<ref name=overington2009>{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Overington |author-link=Caroline Overington |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/biker-mates-rue-calling-triple-0/story-e6frg6no-1225703296424 |title=Biker mates rue calling Triple-0 |date=25 April 2009 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref> is that operators of triple-0 could not use GPS within GSM or CDMA systems to accurately locate distressed or injured persons using mobile phones visibly away from roads.

During the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]], philosophical collections were published as a [[sub-series]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} of university proceedings, which were renamed in 1993 Studia Philosophica. The magazine was first published in its current online form in 2008, but in 2011 two special issues (1.1 & 1.2, 2.2) were also published on paper. The magazine is divided into \"volumes\", so that each volume contains articles published during one year. As of 2009, the 1st issue of each volume covers all the usual articles, the numbers 2 to n are special issues. The numbering of magazine issues thus consists of two parts: a volume and a number.

During the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]], philosophical collections were published as a [[sub-series]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} of university proceedings and since 1993 under the name Studia Philosophica. The magazine was first published in its current online form from 2008, but in 2011 two special issues (1.1 & 1.2, 2.2) were also published on paper. The magazine is divided into \"volumes\", so that each volume contains articles published during one year. As of 2009, the 1st issue of each volume covers all the usual articles, the numbers 2 to n are special issues. The numbering of magazine issues thus consists of two parts: a volume and a number. The base number for 2008 is 1.1, the base number for 2009 is 2.1, the first special issue for the same year is 2.2, etc.\n\n== Editing ==\nThe editor-in-chief of the magazine is Roomet Jakapi.

Sufferers are commonly exposed to the dust by their occupation or hobbies.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is categorized as acute, subacute, and chronic based on the duration of the illness.<ref>http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/medical_services/pulmonary/ild/conditions/hp/signs.html signs and symptoms</ref>\n\n===Acute===\nIn the [[Acute (medical)|acute]] form of HP, symptoms may develop 4\u20136 hours following heavy exposure to the provoking antigen. Symptoms include [[fever]], [[chills]], [[malaise]], [[cough]], [[chest tightness]], [[dyspnea]], [[rash]], [[swelling (medical)|swelling]] and [[headache]]. Symptoms resolve within 12 hours to several days upon cessation of exposure.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\nAcute HP is characterized by poorly formed noncaseating interstitial [[granuloma]]s and [[mononuclear cell infiltration]] in a peribronchial distribution with prominent giant cells.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\nOn [[chest radiograph]]s, a diffuse micronodular interstitial pattern (at times with ground-glass density in the lower and middle lung zones) may be observed. Findings are normal in approximately 10% of patients.\" In high-resolution [[CT scan]]s, [[Ground glass opacity|ground-glass opacities]] or diffusely increased radiodensities are present. Pulmonary function tests show reduced diffusion capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide ([[DLCO]]). Many patients have [[hypoxemia]] at rest, and all patients [[Oxygenation (medicine)#Medical significance|desaturate]] with exercise.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/> Extrinsic allergic alveolitis may eventually lead to [[Interstitial lung disease]].<ref name=\"pmid16635083\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ismail T, McSharry C, Boyd G |title=Extrinsic allergic alveolitis |journal=Respirology |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=262\u20138 |year=2006 |pmid=16635083 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1843.2006.00839.x }}</ref>\n\n===Subacute===\nPatients with [[subacute]] HP gradually develop a [[productive cough]], [[dyspnea]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[weight loss]], and [[pleurisy]]. Symptoms are similar to the acute form of the disease, but are less severe and last longer. On chest radiographs, micronodular or reticular opacities are most prominent in mid-to-lower lung zones.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/> Findings may be present in patients who have experienced repeated acute attacks.\n\nThe subacute, or intermittent, form produces more well-formed noncaseating granulomas, [[bronchiolitis]] with or without organizing [[pneumonia]], and interstitial [[fibrosis]].<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\n===Chronic===\nIn chronic HP, patients often lack a history of acute episodes. They have an insidious onset of cough, progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss. This is associated with partial to complete but gradual reversibility. Avoiding any further exposure is recommended. [[Nail clubbing|Clubbing]] is observed in 50% of patients. [[Tachypnea]], respiratory distress, and inspiratory crackles over lower lung fields often are present.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\nOn chest radiographs, progressive fibrotic changes with loss of lung volume particularly affect the upper lobes. Nodular or ground-glass opacities are not present. Features of emphysema are found on significant chest films and CT scans.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\nChronic forms reveal additional findings of chronic interstitial inflammation and alveolar destruction ([[honeycomb]]ing) associated with dense fibrosis. Cholesterol clefts or [[Asteroid body|asteroid bodies]] are present within or outside granulomas.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\nIn addition, many patients have hypoxemia at rest, and all patients desaturate with exercise.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis involves inhalation of an [[antigen]]. This leads to an exaggerated [[immune]] response ([[hypersensitivity]]). [[Type III hypersensitivity]] and [[type IV hypersensitivity]] can both occur depending on the cause.<ref name=\"pmid15316440\">{{cite journal |author=Mohr LC |title=Hypersensitivity pneumonitis |journal=Curr Opin Pulm Med |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=401\u201311 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15316440 |doi= 10.1097/01.mcp.0000135675.95674.29}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe diagnosis is based upon a history of [[symptoms]] after exposure to the [[allergen]] and [[Clinical research|clinical tests]].  A physician may take blood tests, seeking signs of [[inflammation]], a [[chest X-ray]] and [[lung function test]]s.  The sufferer shows a [[restrictive]] loss of lung function.\n\nPrecipitating IgG antibodies against fungal or avian antigens can be detected in the laboratory using the traditional Ouchterlony immunodiffusion method wherein 'precipitin' lines form on agar plate. The ImmunoCAP technology has replaced this time-consuming, labor-intensive method with their automated CAP assays and FEIA (Fluorescence enzyme immunoassay) that can detect IgG antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus (Farmer's lung or for ABPA) or avian antigens (Bird Fancier's Lung).\n<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ijaai.in/article.asp?issn=0972-6691;year=2012;volume=26;issue=2;spage=89;epage=90;aulast=Khan|title=Making the case for using the Aspergillus immunoglobulin G enzyme linked immunoassay than the precipitin test in the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis|first1=Sujoy|last1=Khan|first2=Suresh|last2=Ramasubban|first3=Chinmoy K|last3=Maity|date=1 July 2012|journal=Indian Journal of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology|volume=26|issue=2|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough overlapping in many cases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis may be distinguished from [[occupational asthma]] in that it is not restricted to only occupational exposure, and that asthma generally is classified as a [[type I hypersensitivity]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-immuno.path.cam.ac.uk/~immuno/part1/lec13/lec13_97.html |title=Lecture 14: Hypersensitivity |accessdate=2008-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206220202/http://www-immuno.path.cam.ac.uk/~immuno/part1/lec13/lec13_97.html |archivedate=2006-02-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaaai.org/aadmc/ate/category.asp?cat=1008 |title=Allergy & Asthma Disease Management Center: Ask the Expert |format= |website= |accessdate=2008-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216085147/http://www.aaaai.org/AADMC/ate/category.asp?cat=1008 |archive-date=2007-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Unlike asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis targets [[lung alveoli]] rather than [[bronchi]].<ref name=Kumar503>Page 503 in: {{cite book |author1=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard |author2=Kumar, Vinay |author3=Abbas, Abul K. |author4=Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1 |edition=8th |ref={{harvid|Kumar|2007}}}}</ref>\n\n===Lung biopsy===\n[[File:Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis - histology.jpg|thumb|Low magnification view of the histology of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Sufferers are commonly exposed to the dust by their occupation or hobbies.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is categorized as acute, subacute, and chronic based on the duration of the illness.<ref>http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/medical_services/pulmonary/ild/conditions/hp/signs.html signs and symptoms</ref>\n\n===Acute===\nIn the [[Acute (medical)|acute]] form of HP, symptoms may develop 4\u20136 hours following heavy exposure to the provoking antigen. Symptoms include [[fever]], [[chills]], [[malaise]], [[cough]], [[chest tightness]], [[dyspnea]], [[rash]], [[swelling (medical)|swelling]] and [[headache]]. Symptoms resolve within 12 hours to several days upon cessation of exposure.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\nAcute HP is characterized by poorly formed noncaseating interstitial [[granuloma]]s and [[mononuclear cell infiltration]] in a peribronchial distribution with prominent giant cells.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\nOn [[chest radiograph]]s, a diffuse micronodular interstitial pattern (at times with ground-glass density in the lower and middle lung zones) may be observed. Findings are normal in approximately 10% of patients.\" In high-resolution [[CT scan]]s, [[Ground glass opacity|ground-glass opacities]] or diffusely increased radiodensities are present. Pulmonary function tests show reduced diffusion capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide ([[DLCO]]). Many patients have [[hypoxemia]] at rest, and all patients [[Oxygenation (medicine)#Medical significance|desaturate]] with exercise.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/> Extrinsic allergic alveolitis may eventually lead to [[Interstitial lung disease]].<ref name=\"pmid16635083\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ismail T, McSharry C, Boyd G |title=Extrinsic allergic alveolitis |journal=Respirology |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=262\u20138 |year=2006 |pmid=16635083 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1843.2006.00839.x }}</ref>\n\n===Subacute===\nPatients with [[subacute]] HP gradually develop a [[productive cough]], [[dyspnea]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[weight loss]], and [[pleurisy]]. Symptoms are similar to the acute form of the disease, but are less severe and last longer. On chest radiographs, micronodular or reticular opacities are most prominent in mid-to-lower lung zones.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/> Findings may be present in patients who have experienced repeated acute attacks.\n\nThe subacute, or intermittent, form produces more well-formed noncaseating granulomas, [[bronchiolitis]] with or without organizing [[pneumonia]], and interstitial [[fibrosis]].<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\n===Chronic===\nIn chronic HP, patients often lack a history of acute episodes. They have an insidious onset of cough, progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss. This is associated with partial to complete but gradual reversibility. Avoiding any further exposure is recommended. [[Nail clubbing|Clubbing]] is observed in 50% of patients. [[Tachypnea]], respiratory distress, and inspiratory crackles over lower lung fields often are present.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\nOn chest radiographs, progressive fibrotic changes with loss of lung volume particularly affect the upper lobes. Nodular or ground-glass opacities are not present. Features of emphysema are found on significant chest films and CT scans.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\nChronic forms reveal additional findings of chronic interstitial inflammation and alveolar destruction ([[honeycomb]]ing) associated with dense fibrosis. Cholesterol clefts or [[Asteroid body|asteroid bodies]] are present within or outside granulomas.<ref name=\"Sharma\"/>\n\nIn addition, many patients have hypoxemia at rest, and all patients desaturate with exercise.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis involves inhalation of an [[antigen]]. This leads to an exaggerated [[immune]] response ([[hypersensitivity]]). [[Type III hypersensitivity]] and [[type IV hypersensitivity]] can both occur depending on the cause.<ref name=\"pmid15316440\">{{cite journal |author=Mohr LC |title=Hypersensitivity pneumonitis |journal=Curr Opin Pulm Med |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=401\u201311 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15316440 |doi= 10.1097/01.mcp.0000135675.95674.29}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe diagnosis is based upon a history of [[symptoms]] after exposure to the [[allergen]] and [[Clinical research|clinical tests]].  A physician may take blood tests, seeking signs of [[inflammation]], a [[chest X-ray]] and [[lung function test]]s.  The sufferer shows a [[restrictive]] loss of lung function.\n\nPrecipitating IgG antibodies against fungal or avian antigens can be detected in the laboratory using the traditional Ouchterlony immunodiffusion method wherein 'precipitin' lines form on agar plate.

{"title_page": "Rhinns of Kells", "text_new": "[[File:RhinnsofKells.jpg|500px|thumb]]\n\nThe '''Rhinns of Kells''' are a range of hills in the [[Galloway Hills]] range, part of the [[Southern Uplands]] of [[Scotland]]. The most easterly of  three parallel ridges, they are neighboured to the west by the [[Range of the Awful Hand]] and the [[Dungeon Hills]]. The eastern portion of the [[Minnigaff Hills]] range lies immediately southwest of the range. In total, these four ranges are part of the [[Galloway Forest Park]]. The hills of the range are the second highest of the Galloway Hills with the highest summit, [[Corserine]], reaching 814m. The ridge is located entirely within [[Dumfries and Galloway]], with the base of the western flanks being a western boundary of the county. \n\nAlthough distant, the ridge is paralleled to the east by the [[A713 road]]. This road provides access to the majority of the starting points for walking the ridge. Most commonly, these are Garryhorn Farm (the turnoff a few hundred metres north of [[Carsphairn]]) and Forrest Estate (accessed much further south a few kilometres north of [[St. John's Town of Dalry]]). Unclassified roads, one of which follows the [[Southern Upland Way]], and two others near [[Clatteringshaws Loch]] can be utilised, but are much less common due to the difficult terrain when ascending or descending from the south. <ref>Turnbull R. (2019) Walking the Galloway Hills: 35 Wild Mountain Walks Including the Merrick. Cicerone: Kendal.</ref> Due to the linear nature of the ridge, a full traverse will normally require two modes of transport at either end if to be walked in a day. Shorter, circular rounds from Forrest Lodge taking in the southern section of the ridge are, as a result, more popular. <ref>https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/galloway/corserine.shtml</ref> A bus service by Houston's Minicoaches runs from [[Dalmellington]] to [[Castle Douglas]] via Carsphairn and St. John's Town of Dalry multiple times a day. <ref>https://bustimes.org/services/520-dalmellington-castle-douglas</ref> \n\n===The Hills===\n------------------------------------\nThe hills of the range are the second highest of the Galloway Hills with the highest hill, Corserine, reaching 814m. The terrain is similar to that of the Range of the Awful Hand in that the walking is predominantly along flat grass with occasional boggy sections, however the drops to the west and east are high, steep and often craggy.

The most easterly of  three parallel ridges, they are neighboured to the west by the [[Range of the Awful Hand]] and the [[Dungeon Hills]]. The eastern portion of the [[Minnigaff Hills]] range lies immediately southwest of the range. In total, these four ranges are part of the [[Galloway Forest Park]]. The hills of the range are the second highest of the Galloway Hills with the highest summit, [[Corserine]], reaching 814m. The ridge is located entirely within [[Dumfries and Galloway]], with the base of the western flanks being a western boundary of the county. \n\nAlthough distant, the ridge is paralleled to the east by the [[A713 road]]. This road provides access to the majority of the starting points for walking the ridge. Most commonly, these are Garryhorn Farm (the turnoff a few hundred metres north of [[Carsphairn]]) and Forrest Estate (accessed much further south a few kilometres north of [[St. John's Town of Dalry]]). Unclassified roads, one of which follows the [[Southern Upland Way]], and two others near [[Clatteringshaws Loch]] can be utilised, but are much less common due to the difficult terrain when ascending or descending from the south. <ref>Turnbull R. (2019) Walking the Galloway Hills: 35 Wild Mountain Walks Including the Merrick. Cicerone: Kendal.</ref> Due to the linear nature of the ridge, a full traverse will normally require two modes of transport at either end if to be walked in a day. Shorter, circular rounds from Forrest Lodge taking in the southern section of the ridge are, as a result, more popular. <ref>https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/galloway/corserine.shtml</ref> A bus service by Houston's Minicoaches runs from [[Dalmellington]] to [[Castle Douglas]] via Carsphairn and St. John's Town of Dalry multiple times a day. <ref>https://bustimes.org/services/520-dalmellington-castle-douglas</ref> \n\n===The Hills===\n------------------------------------\nThe hills of the range are the second highest of the Galloway Hills with the highest hill, Corserine, reaching 814m. The terrain is similar to that of the Range of the Awful Hand in that the walking is predominantly along flat grass with occasional boggy sections, however the drops to the west and east are high, steep and often craggy.

Its restless sequence of quickly maturing artistic styles reveals something of Minoan patrons' pleasure in novelty while they assist archaeologists in assigning relative dates to the [[Archaeology|strata]] of their sites. Pots that contained oils and ointments, exported from 18th century BC [[Crete]], have been found at sites through the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands and mainland [[Greece]], on [[Cyprus]], along coastal [[Syria]] and in [[Egypt]], showing the wide trading contacts of the Minoans.\n\nThe pottery consists of vessels of various shapes, which as with other types of [[Ancient Greek pottery]] may be collectively referred to as \"vases\", and also \"terracottas\", small ceramic figurines, models of buildings and some other types. Some pieces, especially the cups of [[rhyton]] shape, overlap the two categories, being both vessels for liquids but essentially sculptural objects.  Several pottery shapes, especially the [[rhyton]] cup, were also produced in soft stones such as [[steatite]], but there was almost no overlap with metal vessels.  Pottery [[sarcophagus]] chests were also made for cremated ashes, as in [[Minoan sarcophagus (Hanover)|an example now in Hanover]].\n\nThe finest achievements came in the Late Minoan period, with the palace [[pottery]] called [[Kamares ware]], and the Late Minoan all-over patterned \"Marine Style\" and \"Floral Style\".  These were widely exported around the [[Aegean civilizations]] and sometimes beyond, and are the high points of the Minoan pottery tradition.\n\nThe best and most comprehensive collection is in the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]] (AMH) on Crete (where most pieces illustrated are held).\n\n==Traditional chronology==\n{{Further|Minoan chronology|Minoan pottery|Minoan eruption#Eruption dating|l3=Dating the Thera eruption}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright border: gray solid 1px; text-align: center; background: white;\"\n|- style=\"background: #ececec;\"\n|+Minoan chronology\n|-\n| 3500\u20132900 BC<ref>This chronology of Minoan Crete is the [http://www.minoancrete.com/chron.htm one used by Andonis Vasilakis] in his book on Minoan Crete, published by Adam Editions in 2000, but other chronologies will vary, sometimes quite considerably (EM periods especially).

His terminology and the one proposed by [[Nikolaos Platon]] are still generally in use and appear in this article.\nFor more details, see the [[Minoan chronology]].\n\nEvans classified fine pottery by the changes in its forms and styles of decoration. Platon concentrated on the episodic history of the Palace of [[Knossos]]. A new method, fabric analysis, involves geologic analysis of coarse and mainly non-decorated sherds as though they were rocks. The resulting classifications are based on composition of the sherds.<ref>[http://sphakia.classics.ox.ac.uk/fabresearch.html ''Fabric Research and Analysis''], The Spakia Survey: Internet Edition.</ref>\n\n==Production and techniques==\nLittle is known about the way the pottery was produced, but it was probably in small artisanal workshops, often clustered in settlements near good sources of [[clay]] for potting.

All of these characteristics remain true of later Greek pottery throughout its great period. The finest wares often have very thin-walled bodies.  The excavation of an abandoned LM [[kiln]] at [[Kommos (Crete)|Kommos]] (the port of [[Phaistos]]), complete with its \"wasters\" (malformed pots), is developing understanding of the details of production.<ref>[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/3306/1/Suppl30.pdf#search=%22Crete%20%22Fine%20Gray%20Ware%22%22 ''A LM IA Ceramic Kiln in South-Central Crete], Joseph W.

A new shape is the straight-sided cylindrical cup.\n\nMMIA wares and local pottery imitating them are found at coastal sites in the eastern [[Peloponnese]], though not more widely in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] until MMIB; their influence on local pottery in the nearby [[Cyclades]] has been studied by Angelia G.

The Kamares featured whole-field floral designs with all elements linked together (Matz). In MMIII patterned vegetative designs, the '''Patterned Style''', began to appear. This phase was replaced by individual vegetative scenes, which marks the start of the '''Floral Style'''. Matz refers to the \"Age of Efflorescence\", which reached an apogee in LM IA. (Some would include Kamares Ware under the Floral Style.)\n\nThe floral style depicts palms and papyrus, with various kinds of lilies and elaborate leaves. It appears in both pottery and frescoes. One tradition of art criticism calls this the \"natural style\" or \"naturalism\" but another points out that the stylized forms and colors are far from natural. Green, the natural color of vegetation, appears rarely. Depth is represented by position around the main scene. <!--On the contrary III is the greatest age of artistic expression. The text was: The end of MMIIB is marked ca 1750  by the catastrophe, probably an earthquake, that levelled the palaces. In the ensueing MMIII, when the palaces were rebuilt, pottery lost its status as an elite vehicle for artistic expression, though this is the period of Minoan expansion that inspired the Greek tradition of a great Minoan [[thalassocracy]].-->\n\n==Late Minoan==\nLMI marks the highwater of Minoan influence throughout the southern Aegean (Peloponnese, Cyclades, Dodecanese, southwestern Anatolia). Late Minoan pottery was being widely exported; it has turned up in Cyprus, the Cyclades, Egypt and Mycenae.\n\n===Floral style===\nFluent movemented designs drawn from [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/diakosm98.html flower and leaf forms], painted in reds and black on white grounds predominate, in steady development from Middle Minoan. In LMIB there is a typical all-over leafy decoration, for which first workshop painters begin to be identifiable through their characteristic motifs; as with all Minoan art, no name ever appears.\n\n===Marine style===\nIn LMIB, the '''Marine Style''' also emerges; in this style, perhaps inspired by frescoes, the entire surface of a pot was covered with sea creatures, octopus, fish and dolphins, against a background of rocks, seaweed and sponges ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060909172221/http://www.ou.edu/finearts/art/ahi4913/aegeanhtml/minoanpottery3.html Examples 1], [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/mar_rito.html Examples 2], [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/mar_rhy.html Examples 3], [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/ther_pit.html Examples 4].

Although the [[rhyton]] (conical vase) is probably [[steatite]], the other ware is most likely [[ceramic]].]]\nAround 1450 BCE, the beginning of LM II, the [[Mycenaean Greeks]] must have moved into the palace of Knossos. They were well-established by 1400, if the Linear B tablets can be dated to then. The resulting LM II culture is not a break with the Minoan past. Minoan traditions continue under a new administration. However, the vase forms and designs became more and more Mycenaean in character with a large variety of decoration. Style names have multiplied and depend to some degree on the author. The names below are only a few of the most common. Some authors just use the name \"Mycenaean Koine\"; that is, the Late Minoan pottery of Crete was to some degree just a variety of widespread Mycenaean forms. The designs are found also on seals and ceilings, in frescoes and on other artifacts. Often Late Minoan pottery is not easily placed in sub-periods. In addition are imports from the neighboring coasts of the Mediterranean. Ceramic is not the only material used: [[breccia]], [[calcite]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[schist]], [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] and other colored and patterned stone were carved into pottery forms. Bronze ware appears imitating the ceramic ware.\n\n===Palace style===\n[[File:Large vessel, paitinted, Late Minoan, 1400-1100 BC, AM Ag. Nikolaos, 0501272.jpg|thumb|Late Minoan III Floral style, 1400-1100 BC]]\nDuring LMII, Mycenean influence became apparent. The [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/artsandtechnology/lm_pot2.html# vase forms] at Knossos are similar to those on the mainland. The '''Palace Style'''<ref>Evans' term, after the Palace Period</ref> showcased by them adapts elements of the previous styles but also adds features, such as the practice of confining decor in reserves and bands, emphasizing the base and shoulder of the pot and the movement towards abstraction ([http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&idNotice=5351 Examples 1], [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/pal_sty.html Examples 2], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060909174000/http://www.ou.edu/finearts/art/ahi4913/aegeanhtml/minoanpottery4.html Examples 3]). This style started in LM II and went on into LM III. The palace style was mostly confined to Knossos. In the late manifestation of the palace style, fluent and spontaneous earlier motifs stiffened and became more geometrical and abstracted. Egyptian motifs such as [[papyrus]] and lotus are prominent.\n\n===Plain and Close Styles===\nThe '''Plain Style''' and '''Close Style''' developed in LM IIIA, B from the Palace Style. In the Close Style the Marine and Floral Styles themes continue, but the artist manifests the ''horror vacui'' or \"dread of emptiness\". The whole field of decoration is filled densely. ([http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/10200/10273/vase_10273.htm Examples]). The Stirrup Jar is especially frequent.\n\n===The Middle East Style===\nIIIC\n\n===Subminoan===\nFinally, in the Subminoan period, the geometric designs of the Dorians become more apparent.

In most 19th-century literature they are described as \"Mycenaean\", and the recognition and analysis of styles and periods had gone some way on this assumption.  Only in the 1890s were the first finds on Crete recognised and published, from a cave at Kamares.  These were found  by a local archaeologist who allowed the young [[John Myres]] to publish them; Myres had realized that they were the same ware as finds in Egypt published by [[Flinders Petrie]].

Its restless sequence of quickly maturing artistic styles reveals something of Minoan patrons' pleasure in novelty while they assist archaeologists in assigning relative dates to the [[Archaeology|strata]] of their sites. Pots that contained oils and ointments, exported from 18th century BC [[Crete]], have been found at sites through the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands and mainland [[Greece]], on [[Cyprus]], along coastal [[Syria]] and in [[Egypt]], showing the wide trading contacts of the Minoans.\n\nThe pottery consists of vessels of various shapes, which as with other types of [[Ancient Greek pottery]] may be collectively referred to as \"vases\", and also \"terracottas\", small ceramic figurines, models of buildings and some other types. Some pieces, especially the cups of [[rhyton]] shape, overlap the two categories, being both vessels for liquids but essentially sculptural objects.  Several pottery shapes, especially the [[rhyton]] cup, were also produced in soft stones such as [[steatite]], but there was almost no overlap with metal vessels.  Pottery [[sarcophagus]] chests were also made for cremated ashes, as in [[Minoan sarcophagus (Hanover)|an example now in Hanover]].\n\nThe finest achievements came in the Late Minoan period, with the palace [[pottery]] called [[Kamares ware]], and the Late Minoan all-over patterned \"Marine Style\" and \"Floral Style\".  These were widely exported around the [[Aegean civilizations]] and sometimes beyond, and are the high points of the Minoan pottery tradition.\n\nThe best and most comprehensive collection is in the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]] (AMH) on Crete (where most pieces illustrated are held).\n\n==Traditional chronology==\n{{Further|Minoan chronology|Minoan pottery|Minoan eruption#Eruption dating|l3=Dating the Thera eruption}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright border: gray solid 1px; text-align: center; background: white;\"\n|- style=\"background: #ececec;\"\n|+Minoan chronology\n|-\n| 3500\u20132900 BC<ref>This chronology of Minoan Crete is the [http://www.minoancrete.com/chron.htm one used by Andonis Vasilakis] in his book on Minoan Crete, published by Adam Editions in 2000, but other chronologies will vary, sometimes quite considerably (EM periods especially).

His terminology and the one proposed by [[Nikolaos Platon]] are still generally in use and appear in this article.\nFor more details, see the [[Minoan chronology]].\n\nEvans classified fine pottery by the changes in its forms and styles of decoration. Platon concentrated on the episodic history of the Palace of [[Knossos]]. A new method, fabric analysis, involves geologic analysis of coarse and mainly non-decorated sherds as though they were rocks. The resulting classifications are based on composition of the sherds.<ref>[http://sphakia.classics.ox.ac.uk/fabresearch.html ''Fabric Research and Analysis''], The Spakia Survey: Internet Edition.</ref>\n\n==Production and techniques==\nLittle is known about the way the pottery was produced, but it was probably in small artisanal workshops, often clustered in settlements near good sources of [[clay]] for potting. For many, potting may well have been a seasonal activity, combined with farming, although the volume and sophistication of later wares suggests full-time specialists, and two classes of workshop, one catering to the palaces.<ref>Traunmueller, 341-350</ref>  There is some evidence that women were also potters.  Archaeologists seeking to understand the conditions of production have drawn tentative comparisons with aspects of both modern Cretan rural artisans and the better-documented Egyptian and Mesopotamian Bronze Age industries.<ref>Traunmueller, 341-350</ref>  In [[Linear B]] the word for potter is \"ke-ra-me-u\".<ref>Traunmueller, 348</ref>\n\nTechnically, [[Slip (ceramics)|slips]] were widely used, with a variety of effects well understood. The [[potter's wheel]] appears to have been available from the MM1B,  but other \"handmade\" methods of forming the body remained in use, and were needed for objects with sculptural shapes.<ref>Oxford, 409</ref>  [[Ceramic glaze]]s were not used, and none of the wares were fired to very high temperatures, remaining [[earthenware]] or [[terracotta]].  All of these characteristics remain true of later Greek pottery throughout its great period. The finest wares often have very thin-walled bodies.  The excavation of an abandoned LM [[kiln]] at [[Kommos (Crete)|Kommos]] (the port of [[Phaistos]]), complete with its \"wasters\" (malformed pots), is developing understanding of the details of production.<ref>[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/3306/1/Suppl30.pdf#search=%22Crete%20%22Fine%20Gray%20Ware%22%22 ''A LM IA Ceramic Kiln in South-Central Crete], Joseph W.

The period is generally characterized by a large number of local wares with frequent [[Cycladic art#Pottery|Cycladic]] parallels or imports, suggesting a population of checkerboard ethnicity deriving from various locations in the eastern Aegean or even wider.

Favored decor was incised line patterns, vertical, horizontal or herring-bone.

In palace workshops, standardization suggests more supervised operations and the rise of elite wares, emphasizing refinements and novelty, so that palace and provincial pottery become differentiated.\n\nThe [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/ceram65.html forms] of the best wares were designed for [https://web.archive.org/web/20040328224239/http://www.anistor.co.hol.gr/english/enback/a985.htm table and service].

The larger pots continued to be made this way.</ref> The well-controlled iron-red slip that was added to the color repertory during MMI could be achieved only in insulated closed kilns that were free of oxygen or smoke.\n\n===Pithoi===\n[[Image:Pithoi storage jars at Knossos.jpg|thumb|300px|\"Medallion [[Pithoi]]\", or storage jars, at the [[Knossos]] palace. Named from the raised disks, they date to MM III/LM IA.]]\nAny population center requires facilities in support of human needs and that is true of the palaces as well. Knossos had extensive sanitation, water supply and drainage systems,<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2007. [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes ''Knossos fieldnotes'', The Modern Antiquarian]</ref> which is evidence that it was not a ceremonial labyrinth or large tomb. Liquid and granular necessities were stored in [[pithoi]] located in magazines, or storage rooms, and elsewhere. Pithoi make their earliest appearance just before MMI begins and continue into Late Minoan, becoming very rare by LMIII ([https://web.archive.org/web/20061006195151/http://www.culture.gr/2/21/211/21123n/00/lk23n012.jpg Examples 1], [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/malia20.html Examples 2]). About 400 pithoi were found at the palace of Knossos. An average pithos held about 1100 pounds of fluid. Perhaps because of the weight, pithoi were not stored on the upper floors.\n\n===New styles===\nNew styles emerge at this time: an Incised Style, the tactile '''Barbotine ware''', studded with knobs and cones of applied clay in bands, waves and ridges, sometimes reminiscent of sand-dollar tests and barnacle growth ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110720050155/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu/Knossos_Images/mmi-b.jpg Example]), and the earliest stages of Kamares ware. Spirals and whorls are the favorite motifs of Minoan pottery from EM III onwards (Walberg). A new shape is the straight-sided cylindrical cup.\n\nMMIA wares and local pottery imitating them are found at coastal sites in the eastern [[Peloponnese]], though not more widely in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] until MMIB; their influence on local pottery in the nearby [[Cyclades]] has been studied by Angelia G. Papagiannopoulou (1991). Shards of MMIIA pottery have been recovered in Egypt and at [[Ugarit]].\n\n===Kamares Ware===\n[[File:AMI - Kamaresvase 1.jpg|thumb|Kamares ware jug]]\n[[Image:AMI - Kamaresvase 2.jpg|thumb|right|A Kamare style vase, 2100-1700 BCE]]\n[[Kamares Ware]] was named after finds in the cave sanctuary at Kamares on Mt. Ida in 1890. It is the first of the virtuoso [[polychrome]] wares of Minoan civilization, though the first expressions of recognizably proto-Kamares decor predate the introduction of the potter's wheel.\n\nFiner clay, thrown on the wheel, permitted more precisely fashioned forms, which were covered with a dark-firing slip and exuberantly painted with slips in white, reds and browns in fluent [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/diak70b.html floral designs], of rosettes or conjoined coiling and uncoiling spirals. Designs are repetitive or sometimes free-floating, but always symmetrically composed. Themes from nature begin here with octopuses, shellfish, lilies, crocuses and palm-trees, all highly stylized. The entire surface of the pot is densely covered, but sometimes the space is partitioned by bands. One variety features extravagantly thin bodies and is called '''Eggshell Ware''' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160416032325/http://www.dilos.com/region/crete/ceramic.html Example 1], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060620135637/http://dunlopartgallery.org/mah/kamares.html Example 2]).\n\nFour stages of Kamares ware were identified by Gisela Walberg (1976), with a \"Classic Kamares\" palace style sited in MMII, especially in the palace complex of Phaistos.

The Kamares featured whole-field floral designs with all elements linked together (Matz). In MMIII patterned vegetative designs, the '''Patterned Style''', began to appear. This phase was replaced by individual vegetative scenes, which marks the start of the '''Floral Style'''. Matz refers to the \"Age of Efflorescence\", which reached an apogee in LM IA. (Some would include Kamares Ware under the Floral Style.)\n\nThe floral style depicts palms and papyrus, with various kinds of lilies and elaborate leaves. It appears in both pottery and frescoes. One tradition of art criticism calls this the \"natural style\" or \"naturalism\" but another points out that the stylized forms and colors are far from natural. Green, the natural color of vegetation, appears rarely. Depth is represented by position around the main scene. <!--On the contrary III is the greatest age of artistic expression. The text was: The end of MMIIB is marked ca 1750  by the catastrophe, probably an earthquake, that levelled the palaces. In the ensueing MMIII, when the palaces were rebuilt, pottery lost its status as an elite vehicle for artistic expression, though this is the period of Minoan expansion that inspired the Greek tradition of a great Minoan [[thalassocracy]].-->\n\n==Late Minoan==\nLMI marks the highwater of Minoan influence throughout the southern Aegean (Peloponnese, Cyclades, Dodecanese, southwestern Anatolia). Late Minoan pottery was being widely exported; it has turned up in Cyprus, the Cylades, Egypt and Mycenae.\n\n===Floral style===\nFluent movemented designs drawn from [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/diakosm98.html flower and leaf forms], painted in reds and black on white grounds predominate, in steady development from Middle Minoan. In LMIB there is a typical all-over leafy decoration, for which first workshop painters begin to be identifiable through their characteristic motifs; as with all Minoan art, no name ever appears.\n\n===Marine style===\nIn LMIB, the '''Marine Style''' also emerges; in this style, perhaps inspired by frescoes, the entire surface of a pot was covered with sea creatures, octopus, fish and dolphins, against a background of rocks, seaweed and sponges ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060909172221/http://www.ou.edu/finearts/art/ahi4913/aegeanhtml/minoanpottery3.html Examples 1], [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/mar_rito.html Examples 2], [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/mar_rhy.html Examples 3], [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/ther_pit.html Examples 4].

Although the [[rhyton]] (conical vase) is probably [[steatite]], the other ware is most likely [[ceramic]].]]\nAround 1450 BCE, the beginning of LM II, the [[Mycenaean Greeks]] must have moved into the palace of Knossos. They were well-established by 1400, if the Linear B tablets can be dated to then. The resulting LM II culture is not a break with the Minoan past. Minoan traditions continue under a new administration. However, the vase forms and designs became more and more Mycenaean in character with a large variety of decoration. Style names have multiplied and depend to some degree on the author. The names below are only a few of the most common. Some authors just use the name \"Mycenaean Koine\"; that is, the Late Minoan pottery of Crete was to some degree just a variety of widespread Mycenaean forms. The designs are found also on seals and ceilings, in frescoes and on other artifacts. Often Late Minoan pottery is not easily placed in sub-periods. In addition are imports from the neighboring coasts of the Mediterranean. Ceramic is not the only material used: [[breccia]], [[calcite]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[schist]], [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] and other colored and patterned stone were carved into pottery forms. Bronze ware appears imitating the ceramic ware.\n\n===Palace style===\n[[File:Large vessel, paitinted, Late Minoan, 1400-1100 BC, AM Ag. Nikolaos, 0501272.jpg|thumb|Late Minoan III Floral style, 1400-1100 BC]]\nDuring LMII, Mycenean influence became apparent. The [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/artsandtechnology/lm_pot2.html# vase forms] at Knossos are similar to those on the mainland. The '''Palace Style'''<ref>Evans' term, after the Palace Period</ref> showcased by them adapts elements of the previous styles but also adds features, such as the practice of confining decor in reserves and bands, emphasizing the base and shoulder of the pot and the movement towards abstraction ([http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&idNotice=5351 Examples 1], [http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/02/crete/en/gallery/pal_sty.html Examples 2], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060909174000/http://www.ou.edu/finearts/art/ahi4913/aegeanhtml/minoanpottery4.html Examples 3]). This style started in LM II and went on into LM III. The palace style was mostly confined to Knossos. In the late manifestation of the palace style, fluent and spontaneous earlier motifs stiffened and became more geometrical and abstracted. Egyptian motifs such as [[papyrus]] and lotus are prominent.\n\n===Plain and Close Styles===\nThe '''Plain Style''' and '''Close Style''' developed in LM IIIA, B from the Palace Style. In the Close Style the Marine and Floral Styles themes continue, but the artist manifests the ''horror vacui'' or \"dread of emptiness\". The whole field of decoration is filled densely. ([http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/10200/10273/vase_10273.htm Examples]). The Stirrup Jar is especially frequent.\n\n===The Middle East Style===\nIIIC\n\n===Subminoan===\nFinally, in the Subminoan period, the geometric designs of the Dorians become more apparent.

In most 19th-century literature they are described as \"Mycenaean\", and the recognition and analysis of styles and periods had gone some way on this assumption.  Only in the 1890s were the first finds on Crete recognised and published, from a cave at Kamares.  These were found  by a local archaeologist who allowed the young [[John Myres]] to publish them; Myres had realized that they were the same ware as finds in Egypt published by [[Flinders Petrie]].
