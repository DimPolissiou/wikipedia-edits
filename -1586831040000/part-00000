{"title_page": "Great Society", "text_new": "{{for| the 1960s band featuring [[Grace Slick]]|The Great Society (band)}}\nThe '''Great Society'''  was a set of domestic programs in the United States launched by [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1964\u201365. It was coined during a 1964 speech by President Lyndon B. Johnson at the [[University of Michigan]] and came to represent his domestic agenda.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=315}}</ref>  The main goal was the total elimination of poverty and racial injustice.\n\nNew major spending programs that addressed education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, and transportation were launched during this period.  The program and its initiatives were subsequently promoted by him and fellow [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in Congress in the 1960s and years following. The Great Society in scope and sweep resembled the [[New Deal]] domestic agenda of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].\n\nSome Great Society proposals were stalled initiatives from [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[New Frontier]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Zelizer, Julian E.|title=The fierce urgency of now : Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the battle for the Great Society|isbn=978-1-59420-434-0|location=New York|oclc=881094066}}</ref> Johnson's success depended on his skills of persuasion, coupled with the Democratic [[United States elections, 1964|landslide victory in the 1964 elections]] that brought in many new liberals to Congress, making the House of Representatives in 1965 the most liberal House since 1938.<ref>''Life'', November 5, 1965</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnti-war Democrats complained that spending on the [[Vietnam War]] choked off the Great Society. While some of the programs have been eliminated or had their funding reduced, many of them, including [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], the [[Older Americans Act]] and federal education funding, continue to the present. The Great Society's programs expanded under the administrations of [[GOP|Republican]] Presidents [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]].<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/letthemincasefor00rile/page/98 98]|author=Riley, Jason L.|title=Let Them In: The Case for Open Borders|url=https://archive.org/details/letthemincasefor00rile|url-access=registration|year=2008}}</ref>\n\n==Economic and social conditions==\nUnlike the old [[New Deal]], which was a response to a severe financial and economic calamity, the Great Society initiatives came during a period of rapid economic growth. Kennedy proposed an across-the-board tax cut lowering the top marginal income tax rate in the United States by 20%, from 91% to 71%, which was enacted in February 1964, three months after Kennedy's assassination, under Johnson. The tax cut also significantly reduced marginal rates in the lower brackets as well as for corporations. The [[gross national product]] rose 10% in the first year of the tax cut, and economic growth averaged a rate of 4.5% from 1961 to 1968.<ref>[[Revenue Act of 1964]]</ref>\n\nGNP increased by 7% in 1964, 8% in 1965, and 9% in 1966. The unemployment rate fell below 5%, and by 1966 the number of families with incomes of $7,000 a year or more had reached 55%, compared with 22% in 1950. In 1968, when [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] published a new edition of ''The Affluent Society,'' the average income of the American family stood at $8,000, double what it had been a decade earlier.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Chafe, William H.

It began by enacting long-stalled legislation such as Medicare and federal aid to education and then moved into other areas, including high-speed mass transit, rental supplements, truth in packaging, environmental safety legislation, new provisions for mental health facilities, the [[Teacher Corps]], manpower training, the [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] program, aid to urban mass transit, a demonstration cities program, a housing act that included rental subsidies, and an act for higher education.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The Johnson Administration submitted 87 bills to Congress, and Johnson signed 84, or 96%, arguably the most successful legislative agenda in US congressional history.<ref name=\"unger104\">Unger, Irwin, 1996: ''The Best of Intentions: the triumphs and failures of the Great Society under Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon.''

The book argues that changes in technology are encroaching on privacy and could create a society in the future with radically different privacy standards. Packard criticized advertisers' unfettered use of private information to create marketing schemes. He compared a recent Great Society initiative by then-president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the [[National Data Bank]], to the use of information by advertisers and argued for increased [[data privacy]] measures to ensure that information did not find its way into the wrong hands. The essay led [[United States Congress|Congress]] to create the [[Special Subcommittee on the Invasion of Privacy]] and inspired privacy advocates such as [[Cornelius Edward Gallagher|Neil Gallagher]] and [[Sam Ervin]] to fight what they perceived as Johnson's flagrant disregard for consumer privacy. Ervin criticized Johnson's domestic agenda as invasive and saw the unfiltered database of consumers' information as a sign of presidential abuse of power. Ervin warned that \"The computer never forgets\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/opinion/google-facebook-privacy.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage|title=The End of Privacy Began in the 1960s}}</ref> Jerry M.

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> forbade job discrimination and the segregation of public accommodations.\n\nThe [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] assured minority registration and voting. It suspended use of literacy or other voter-qualification tests that had sometimes served to keep [[African-American]]s off voting lists and provided for federal court lawsuits to stop discriminatory [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]]. It also reinforced the Civil Rights Act of 1964<ref name=\"cra64\"/> by authorizing the appointment of federal voting examiners in areas that did not meet voter-participation requirements. The [[Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965]] abolished the national-origin quotas in immigration law. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]] banned housing discrimination and extended constitutional protections to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on [[Indian reservation|reservations]].\n\nJohnson recognized the benefits and costs of passing civil rights legislation. His support for the 1964 Civil Rights Act was despite his personal opinions on racial matters, as Johnson regularly articulated thoughts and disparaging language against racial minorities, including against African-Americans and Asians.<ref name=\"msnbc.com\">Serwer, Adam. \"Lyndon Johnson was a civil rights hero.

The Kennedy Administration had been contemplating a federal effort against poverty. Johnson, who, as a teacher, had observed extreme poverty in [[Texas]] among [[Mexican-American]]s, launched an \"unconditional war on poverty\" in the first months of his presidency with the goal of eliminating hunger, illiteracy, and unemployment from American life. The centerpiece of the [[War on Poverty]] was the [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]], which created an [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO) to oversee a variety of community-based antipoverty programs.\n\nFederal funds were provided for special education schemes in slum areas, including help in paying for books and transport, while financial aid was also provided for slum clearances and rebuilding city areas. In addition, the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 created jobs in one of the most impoverished regions of the country.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 provided various methods through which young people from poor homes could receive job training and higher education.<ref>Lowe, Norman. ''Mastering Modern World History.''</ref>\n\nThe OEO reflected a fragile consensus among policymakers that the best way to deal with poverty was not simply to raise the incomes of the poor but to help them better themselves through education, job training, and community development. Central to its mission was the idea of \"[[Community Action Agencies|community action]]\", the participation of the poor in framing and administering the programs designed to help them.\n\n====Programs====\nThe War on Poverty began with a $1 billion appropriation in 1964 and spent another $2 billion in the following two years. It gave rise to dozens of programs, among them the [[Job Corps]], whose purpose was to help disadvantaged youth develop marketable skills; the [[Neighborhood Youth Corps]], established to give poor urban youths work experience and to encourage them to stay in school; [[Volunteers in Service to America]] ([[Volunteers in Service to America|VISTA]]), a domestic version of the [[Peace Corps]], which placed concerned citizens with community-based agencies to work towards empowerment of the poor; the [[Model Cities Program]] for urban redevelopment; [[Upward Bound]], which assisted poor high school students entering college; legal services for the poor; and the [[Food Stamp Act of 1964]] (which expanded the federal food stamp program).<ref name=\"adaction1964\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.adaction.org/media/votingrecords/1964.pdf |title=Voting Record-88th Congress, 2nd Session |journal=ADA World |publisher=Americans for Democratic Action |date=October 1964 |accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPrograms included the [[Community Action Program]], which initiated local [[Community Action Agencies]] charged with helping the poor become self-sufficient; and Project [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]], which offered preschool education for poor children.

It was signed into law on April 11, 1965, less than three months after it was introduced. It ended a long-standing political taboo by providing significant federal aid to public education, initially allocating more than $1 billion to help schools purchase materials and start special education programs to schools with a high concentration of low-income children. During its first year of operation, the Act authorized a $1.1 billion program of grants to states, for allocations to school districts with large numbers of children of low-income families, funds to use community facilities for education within the entire community, funds to improve educational research and to strengthen state departments of education, and grants for the purchase of books and library materials.<ref name=\"adaction1965\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.adaction.org/media/votingrecords/1965.pdf |title=Voting Record-89th Congress, 1st Session |journal=ADA World |publisher=Americans for Democratic Action |date=November 1965 |accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref> The Act also established [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]], which had originally been started by the Office of Economic Opportunity as an eight-week summer program, as a permanent program.\n\nThe Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963, which was signed into law by Johnson a month after becoming president,<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=26387#axzz1ew5Ba2Da Lyndon B.

The Act also began a transition from federally funded institutional assistance to individual student aid.\n\nIn 1964, basic improvements in the National Defense Education Act were achieved, and total funds available to educational institutions were increased. The yearly limit on loans to graduate and professional students was raised from $1,000 to $2,500, and the aggregate limit was raised from $5,000 to $10,000.

Johnson signs Medicare Bill at the Harry S. Truman Library, 1965.jpg|thumb|300px|President Johnson signs the Social Security Act of 1965.]]\nThe [[Social Security Act of 1965]] authorized [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and provided federal funding for many of the medical costs of older Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=99 |title=Social Security Act Amendments (1965) |publisher=Ourdocuments.gov |accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref> The legislation overcame the bitter resistance, particularly from the [[American Medical Association]], to the idea of [[publicly funded health care]] or \"[[socialized medicine]]\" by making its benefits available to everyone over sixty-five, regardless of need, and by linking payments to the existing private insurance system.\n\n====Medicaid====\n{{Main|Medicaid}}\nIn 1966 welfare recipients of all ages received medical care through the [[Medicaid]] program.  Medicaid was created on July 30, 1965 under Title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1965. Each state administers its own Medicaid program while the federal [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) monitors the state-run programs and establishes requirements for service delivery, quality, funding, and eligibility standards.\n\n===Welfare===\nA number of improvements were made to the Social Security program in terms of both coverage and adequacy of benefits. The Tax Adjustment Act of 1966 included a provision for special payments under the social security program to certain uninsured individuals aged 72 and over. The Social Security Amendments of 1965 included a 7% increase in cash benefits, a liberalization of the definition of disability, a liberalization of the amount a person can earn and still get full benefits (the so-called retirement test), payment of benefits to eligible children aged 18\u201321 who are attending school, payment of benefits to widows at age 60 on an actuarially reduced basis, coverage of self-employed physicians, coverage of tips as wages, liberalization of insured-status requirements for persons already aged 72 or over, an increase to $6,600 the amount of earnings counted for contribution and benefit purposes (the contribution and benefit base), and an increase in the contribution rate schedule.<ref name=\"ssa\" />\n\nThe Social Security Amendments of 1967 included a 13% increase in old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits, with a minimum monthly benefit of $55 for a person retiring at or after age-65 (or receiving disability benefits), an increase from $35 to $40 in the special age-72 payments, an increase from $1,500 to $1,680 in the amount a person may earn in a year and still get full benefits for that year, monthly cash benefits for disabled widows and disabled dependent widowers at age 50 at reduced rates, a liberalization of the eligibility requirements for benefits for dependents and Survivors of women workers, and an alternative insured-status test for workers disabled before age 31.<ref name=\"ssa\" />\n\nAdditionally, new guidelines for determining eligibility for disability insurance benefits, additional non-contributory wage credits for servicemen, broadened coverage of clergy and members of religious orders who have not taken a vow of poverty, and an increase in the contribution and benefit base from $6,600 to $7,800, beginning in 1968. In addition, the Social Security Amendments of 1967 provided the first major amendments of Medicare. These social security amendments extended the coverage of the program to include certain services previously excluded, simplified reimbursement procedures under both the hospital and medical insurance plans, and facilitated the administrative procedures concerning general enrollment periods.<ref name=\"ssa\" />\n\nThe Food Stamp Act of 1964 made the program permanent, while the Social Security Amendments of 1967 specified that at least 6% of monies for maternal and child health should be spent on family planning. By 1967, the federal government began requiring state health departments to make contraceptives available to all adults who were poor. Meal programs for low-income senior citizens began in 1965, with the federal government providing funding for \"congregate meals\" and \"home-delivered meals.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yk5NI69ZO9sC&pg=PA88&dq=food+stamp+act+1964+provisions#v=onepage&q=food%20stamp%20act%201964%20provisions&f=false|title=Poverty and the Government in America|isbn=9781598841688|last1=Sreenivasan|first1=Jyotsna|year=2009}}</ref> The Child Nutrition Act, passed in 1966, made improvements to nutritional assistance to children such as in the introduction of the School Breakfast Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/aboutlunch/programhistory_6.htm|title=Child Nutrition Act of 1966 - Food and Nutrition Service|work=usda.gov|access-date=2013-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813211140/http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/aboutlunch/programhistory_6.htm|archive-date=2013-08-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===The arts and cultural institutions===\nJohnson promoted the arts in terms of social betterment, not artistic creativity. He typically emphasized qualitative and quantitative goals, especially  the power of the arts to improve the quality of life of ordinary Americans and to reduce the inequalities between the haves and the have-nots.  Karen Patricia Heath observes that, \"Johnson personally was not much interested in the acquisition of knowledge, cultural or otherwise, for its own sake, nor did he have time for art appreciation or meeting with artists.\" <ref>Karen Patricia Heath,  \"Artistic scarcity in an age of material abundance: President Lyndon Johnson, the National Endowment for the Arts, and Great Society liberalism.\" ''European Journal of American Culture'' 36.1 (2017): 5-22.

Lobbying for federally funded arts and humanities support began during the Kennedy Administration. In 1963 three scholarly and educational organizations\u2014the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), the Council of Graduate Schools in America, and the United Chapters of [[Phi Beta Kappa]]\u2014joined together to establish the National Commission on the Humanities. In June 1964, the commission released a report that suggested that the emphasis placed on science endangered the study of the humanities from elementary schools through postgraduate programs. In order to correct the balance, it recommended \"the establishment by the President and the Congress of the United States of a National Humanities Foundation.\"<ref name=\"neh\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neh.gov/nehat40/founding/ |title=How NEH got its start |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |date=September 29, 1965 |accessdate=August 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305215642/http://www.neh.gov/nehat40/founding/ |archive-date=March 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn August 1964, Representative [[William S. Moorhead]] of Pennsylvania proposed legislation to implement the commission's recommendations. Support from the White House followed in September, when Johnson lent his endorsement during a speech at [[Brown University]]. In March 1965, the [[White House]] proposed the establishment of a National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities and requested $20 million in start-up funds. The commission's report had generated other proposals, but the White House's approach eclipsed them. The administration's plan, which called for the creation of two separate agencies each advised by a governing body, was the version that the Congress approved. [[Richard Nixon]] dramatically expanded funding for NEH and NEA.<ref name=\"neh\"/>\n\n====Public broadcasting====\n{{main|Public Broadcasting Service}}\nAfter the First National Conference on Long-Range Financing of Educational Television Stations in December 1964 called for a study of the role of noncommercial education television in society, the [[Carnegie Corporation]] agreed to finance the work of a 15-member national commission. Its landmark report, ''Public Television: A Program for Action,'' published on January 26, 1967, popularized the phrase \"public television\" and assisted the legislative campaign for federal aid. The [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967]], enacted less than 10 months later, chartered the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] as a private, non-profit corporation.\n\nThe law initiated federal aid through the CPB for the operation, as opposed to the funding of capital facilities, of public broadcasting. The CPB initially collaborated with the pre-existing [[National Educational Television]] system, but in 1969 decided to start the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS). A public radio study commissioned by the CPB and the [[Ford Foundation]] and conducted from 1968 to 1969 led to the establishment of [[National Public Radio]], a public radio system under the terms of the amended Public Broadcasting Act.\n\n====Cultural centers====\nTwo long-planned national cultural and arts facilities received federal funding that would allow for their completion through Great Society legislation. A National Cultural Center, suggested during the [[Franklin Roosevelt]] Administration and created by a bipartisan law signed by [[Dwight Eisenhower]], was transformed into the [[Kennedy Center|John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]],  a living memorial to the assassinated president. Fundraising for the original cultural center had been poor prior to legislation creating the Kennedy Center, which passed two months after the president's death and provided $23 million for construction. The Kennedy Center opened in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wosu.org/archive/jfk/legacy.php |title=Living Legacy: Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts |publisher=WOSU |accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1930s the U.S. Congress mandated a [[Smithsonian Institution]] art museum for the National Mall, and a design by [[Eliel Saarinen]] was unveiled in 1939, but plans were shelved during World War II. A 1966 act of the U.S. Congress established the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] as part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] with a focus on modern art, in contrast to the existing [[National Gallery of Art|National Art Gallery]]. The museum was primarily federally funded, although New York financier [[Joseph Hirshhorn]] later contributed $1 million toward building construction, which began in 1969. The Hirshhorn opened in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hirshhorn.si.edu/museum/story_text.html |title=The Hirshhorn Story |publisher=Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702201156/http://hirshhorn.si.edu/museum/story_text.html |archivedate=July 2, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Transportation===\nTransportation initiatives started during President Johnson's term in office included the consolidation of transportation agencies into a cabinet-level position under the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]].<ref>{{cite web |first=R.

Congress passed a variety of legislation to support improvements in transportation including The [[Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964]] which provided $375 million for large-scale urban public or private rail projects in the form of matching funds to cities and states and created the [[Urban Mass Transit Administration]] (now the [[Federal Transit Administration]]), [[High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965]] which resulted in the creation of [[Metroliner (train)|high-speed rail between New York and Washington]], and the [[National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966]]\u2014a bill largely taken credit for by [[Ralph Nader]], whose book ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]'' he claims helped inspire the legislation.\n\n===Consumer protection===\nIn 1964, Johnson named Assistant Secretary of Labor [[Esther Peterson]] to be the first presidential assistant for consumer affairs.\n\nThe [[Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act]] of 1965 required packages to carry warning labels. The Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 set standards through creation of the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]. The [[Fair Packaging and Labeling Act]] requires products identify manufacturer, address, clearly mark quantity and servings. The statute also authorized the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|HEW]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] to establish and define voluntary standard sizes. The original would have mandated uniform standards of size and weight for comparison shopping, but the final law only outlawed exaggerated size claims.\n\nThe Child Safety Act of 1966 prohibited any chemical so dangerous that no warning can make it safe. The Flammable Fabrics Act of 1967 set standards for children's sleepwear, but not baby blankets.\n\nThe [[Wholesome Meat Act]] of 1967 required inspection of meat which must meet federal standards. The [[Truth-in-Lending Act]] of 1968 required lenders and credit providers to disclose the full cost of finance charges in both dollars and annual percentage rates, on installment loan and sales. The Wholesome Poultry Products Act of 1968 required inspection of poultry which must meet federal standards. The Land Sales Disclosure Act of 1968 provided safeguards against fraudulent practices in the sale of land. The Radiation Safety Act of 1968 provided standards and recalls for defective electronic products.\n\n===The environment===\n[[Joseph A.

Under Title III of the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act, Special Programs to Combat Rural Poverty, the Office for Economic Opportunity was authorized to act as a lender of last resort for rural families who needed money to help them permanently increase their earning capacity. Loans could be made to purchase land, improve the operation of family farms, allow participation in cooperative ventures, and finance non-agricultural business enterprises, while local cooperatives which served low-income rural families could apply for another category of loans for similar purposes.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nTitle III also made loans and grants available to local groups to improve housing, education, and child care services for migrant farm workers, while Titles I and II also included potentially important programs for rural development. Title I established the Job Corps which enrolled school dropouts in community service projects: 40% of the corpsmen were to work in a Youth Conservation Corps to carry out resource conservation, beautification, and development projects in the National Forests and countryside. Arguably more important for rural areas were the Community Action Programs authorized by Title II. Federal money was allocated to States according to their needs for job training, housing, health, and welfare assistance, and the States were then to distribute their shares of the Community Action grants on the basis of proposals from local public or non-profit private groups.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite book |last=Roth |first=Dennis |chapter-url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/ric/ricpubs/rural_development_chap5.pdf |chapter=The Johnson Administration and the Great Society |title=Federal Rural Development Policy in the Twentieth Century |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=August 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824082628/http://www.nal.usda.gov/ric/ricpubs/rural_development_chap5.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 reorganized the Areas Redevelopment Administration (ARA) into the [[Economic Development Administration]] (EDA), and authorized $3.3 billion over 5 years while specifying seven criteria for eligibility.

In an attempt to go beyond what one writer described as \"ARA's failed scattershot approach\" of providing aid to individual counties and inspired by the European model of regional development, the EDA encouraged counties to form Economic Development Districts (EDDs) as it was recognized that individual distressed counties (called RAs or Redevelopment Areas) lacked sufficient resources for their own development.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nEDDs encompassed from 5 to 15 counties and both planned and implemented development with EDA funding and technical assistance, and each EDD had a \"growth center\" (another concept borrowed from Europe) called a redevelopment center if it was located in an RA or development center if in another county.

The tax cut also significantly reduced marginal rates in the lower brackets as well as for corporations.

The essay led [[United States Congress|Congress]] to create the [[Special Subcommittee on the Invasion of Privacy]] and inspired privacy advocates such as [[Cornelius Edward Gallagher|Neil Gallagher]] and [[Sam Ervin]] to fight what they perceived as Johnson's flagrant disregard for consumer privacy.

The Kennedy Administration had been contemplating a federal effort against poverty. Johnson, who, as a teacher, had observed extreme poverty in [[Texas]] among [[Mexican-American]]s, launched an \"unconditional war on poverty\" in the first months of his presidency with the goal of eliminating hunger, illiteracy, and unemployment from American life. The centerpiece of the [[War on Poverty]] was the [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]], which created an [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO) to oversee a variety of community-based antipoverty programs.\n\nFederal funds were provided for special education schemes in slum areas, including help in paying for books and transport, while financial aid was also provided for slum clearances and rebuilding city areas. In addition, the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 created jobs in one of the most impoverished regions of the country.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 provided various methods through which young people from poor homes could receive job training and higher education.<ref>Lowe, Norman. ''Mastering Modern World History.''</ref>\n\nThe OEO reflected a fragile consensus among policymakers that the best way to deal with poverty was not simply to raise the incomes of the poor but to help them better themselves through education, job training, and community development. Central to its mission was the idea of \"[[Community Action Agencies|community action]]\", the participation of the poor in framing and administering the programs designed to help them.\n\n====Programs====\nThe War on Poverty began with a $1 billion appropriation in 1964 and spent another $2 billion in the following two years. It gave rise to dozens of programs, among them the [[Job Corps]], whose purpose was to help disadvantaged youth develop marketable skills; the [[Neighborhood Youth Corps]], established to give poor urban youths work experience and to encourage them to stay in school; [[Volunteers in Service to America]] ([[Volunteers in Service to America|VISTA]]), a domestic version of the [[Peace Corps]], which placed concerned citizens with community-based agencies to work towards empowerment of the poor; the [[Model Cities Program]] for urban redevelopment; [[Upward Bound]], which assisted poor high school students entering college; legal services for the poor; and the [[Food Stamp Act of 1964]] (which expanded the federal food stamp program).<ref name=\"adaction1964\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.adaction.org/media/votingrecords/1964.pdf |title=Voting Record-88th Congress, 2nd Session |journal=ADA World |publisher=Americans for Democratic Action |date=October 1964 |accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPrograms included the [[Community Action Program]], which initiated local [[Community Action Agencies]] charged with helping the poor become self-sufficient; and Project [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]], which offered preschool education for poor children.

It was signed into law on April 11, 1965, less than three months after it was introduced. It ended a long-standing political taboo by providing significant federal aid to public education, initially allocating more than $1 billion to help schools purchase materials and start special education programs to schools with a high concentration of low-income children. During its first year of operation, the Act authorized a $1.1 billion program of grants to states, for allocations to school districts with large numbers of children of low-income families, funds to use community facilities for education within the entire community, funds to improve educational research and to strengthen state departments of education, and grants for the purchase of books and library materials.<ref name=\"adaction1965\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.adaction.org/media/votingrecords/1965.pdf |title=Voting Record-89th Congress, 1st Session |journal=ADA World |publisher=Americans for Democratic Action |date=November 1965 |accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref> The Act also established [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]], which had originally been started by the Office of Economic Opportunity as an eight-week summer program, as a permanent program.\n\nThe Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963, which was signed into law by Johnson a month after becoming president,<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=26387#axzz1ew5Ba2Da Lyndon B.

The Act also began a transition from federally funded institutional assistance to individual student aid.\n\nIn 1964, basic improvements in the National Defense Education Act were achieved, and total funds available to educational institutions were increased. The yearly limit on loans to graduate and professional students was raised from $1,000 to $2,500, and the aggregate limit was raised from $5,000 to $10,000.

Johnson signs Medicare Bill at the Harry S. Truman Library, 1965.jpg|thumb|300px|President Johnson signs the Social Security Act of 1965.]]\nThe [[Social Security Act of 1965]] authorized [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and provided federal funding for many of the medical costs of older Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=99 |title=Social Security Act Amendments (1965) |publisher=Ourdocuments.gov |accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref> The legislation overcame the bitter resistance, particularly from the [[American Medical Association]], to the idea of [[publicly funded health care]] or \"[[socialized medicine]]\" by making its benefits available to everyone over sixty-five, regardless of need, and by linking payments to the existing private insurance system.\n\n====Medicaid====\n{{Main|Medicaid}}\nIn 1966 welfare recipients of all ages received medical care through the [[Medicaid]] program.  Medicaid was created on July 30, 1965 under Title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1965. Each state administers its own Medicaid program while the federal [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) monitors the state-run programs and establishes requirements for service delivery, quality, funding, and eligibility standards.\n\n===Welfare===\nA number of improvements were made to the Social Security program in terms of both coverage and adequacy of benefits. The Tax Adjustment Act of 1966 included a provision for special payments under the social security program to certain uninsured individuals aged 72 and over. The Social Security Amendments of 1965 included a 7% increase in cash benefits, a liberalization of the definition of disability, a liberalization of the amount a person can earn and still get full benefits (the so-called retirement test), payment of benefits to eligible children aged 18\u201321 who are attending school, payment of benefits to widows at age 60 on an actuarially reduced basis, coverage of self-employed physicians, coverage of tips as wages, liberalization of insured-status requirements for persons already aged 72 or over, an increase to $6,600 the amount of earnings counted for contribution and benefit purposes (the contribution and benefit base), and an increase in the contribution rate schedule.<ref name=\"ssa\" />\n\nThe Social Security Amendments of 1967 included a 13% increase in old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits, with a minimum monthly benefit of $55 for a person retiring at or after age-65 (or receiving disability benefits), an increase from $35 to $40 in the special age-72 payments, an increase from $1,500 to $1,680 in the amount a person may earn in a year and still get full benefits for that year, monthly cash benefits for disabled widows and disabled dependent widowers at age 50 at reduced rates, a liberalization of the eligibility requirements for benefits for dependents and Survivors of women workers, and an alternative insured-status test for workers disabled before age 31.<ref name=\"ssa\" />\n\nAdditionally, new guidelines for determining eligibility for disability insurance benefits, additional non-contributory wage credits for servicemen, broadened coverage of clergy and members of religious orders who have not taken a vow of poverty, and an increase in the contribution and benefit base from $6,600 to $7,800, beginning in 1968. In addition, the Social Security Amendments of 1967 provided the first major amendments of Medicare. These social security amendments extended the coverage of the program to include certain services previously excluded, simplified reimbursement procedures under both the hospital and medical insurance plans, and facilitated the administrative procedures concerning general enrollment periods.<ref name=\"ssa\" />\n\nThe Food Stamp Act of 1964 made the program permanent, while the Social Security Amendments of 1967 specified that at least 6% of monies for maternal and child health should be spent on family planning. By 1967, the federal government began requiring state health departments to make contraceptives available to all adults who were poor. Meal programs for low-income senior citizens began in 1965, with the federal government providing funding for \"congregate meals\" and \"home-delivered meals.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yk5NI69ZO9sC&pg=PA88&dq=food+stamp+act+1964+provisions#v=onepage&q=food%20stamp%20act%201964%20provisions&f=false|title=Poverty and the Government in America|isbn=9781598841688|last1=Sreenivasan|first1=Jyotsna|year=2009}}</ref> The Child Nutrition Act, passed in 1966, made improvements to nutritional assistance to children such as in the introduction of the School Breakfast Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/aboutlunch/programhistory_6.htm|title=Child Nutrition Act of 1966 - Food and Nutrition Service|work=usda.gov|access-date=2013-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813211140/http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/aboutlunch/programhistory_6.htm|archive-date=2013-08-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===The arts and cultural institutions===\nJohnson promoted the arts in terms of social betterment, not artistic creativity. He typically emphasized qualitative and quantitative goals, especially  the power of the arts to improve the quality of life of ordinary Americans and to reduce the inequalities between the haves and the have-nots.  Karen Patricia Heath observes that, \"Johnson personally was not much interested in the acquisition of knowledge, cultural or otherwise, for its own sake, nor did he have time for art appreciation or meeting with artists.\" <ref>Karen Patricia Heath,  \"Artistic scarcity in an age of material abundance: President Lyndon Johnson, the National Endowment for the Arts, and Great Society liberalism.\" ''European Journal of American Culture'' 36.1 (2017): 5-22.

Lobbying for federally funded arts and humanities support began during the Kennedy Administration. In 1963 three scholarly and educational organizations\u2014the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), the Council of Graduate Schools in America, and the United Chapters of [[Phi Beta Kappa]]\u2014joined together to establish the National Commission on the Humanities. In June 1964, the commission released a report that suggested that the emphasis placed on science endangered the study of the humanities from elementary schools through postgraduate programs. In order to correct the balance, it recommended \"the establishment by the President and the Congress of the United States of a National Humanities Foundation.\"<ref name=\"neh\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neh.gov/nehat40/founding/ |title=How NEH got its start |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |date=September 29, 1965 |accessdate=August 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305215642/http://www.neh.gov/nehat40/founding/ |archive-date=March 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn August 1964, Representative [[William S. Moorhead]] of Pennsylvania proposed legislation to implement the commission's recommendations. Support from the White House followed in September, when Johnson lent his endorsement during a speech at [[Brown University]]. In March 1965, the [[White House]] proposed the establishment of a National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities and requested $20 million in start-up funds. The commission's report had generated other proposals, but the White House's approach eclipsed them. The administration's plan, which called for the creation of two separate agencies each advised by a governing body, was the version that the Congress approved. [[Richard Nixon]] dramatically expanded funding for NEH and NEA.<ref name=\"neh\"/>\n\n====Public broadcasting====\n{{main|Public Broadcasting Service}}\nAfter the First National Conference on Long-Range Financing of Educational Television Stations in December 1964 called for a study of the role of noncommercial education television in society, the [[Carnegie Corporation]] agreed to finance the work of a 15-member national commission. Its landmark report, ''Public Television: A Program for Action,'' published on January 26, 1967, popularized the phrase \"public television\" and assisted the legislative campaign for federal aid. The [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967]], enacted less than 10 months later, chartered the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] as a private, non-profit corporation.\n\nThe law initiated federal aid through the CPB for the operation, as opposed to the funding of capital facilities, of public broadcasting. The CPB initially collaborated with the pre-existing [[National Educational Television]] system, but in 1969 decided to start the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS). A public radio study commissioned by the CPB and the [[Ford Foundation]] and conducted from 1968 to 1969 led to the establishment of [[National Public Radio]], a public radio system under the terms of the amended Public Broadcasting Act.\n\n====Cultural centers====\nTwo long-planned national cultural and arts facilities received federal funding that would allow for their completion through Great Society legislation. A National Cultural Center, suggested during the [[Franklin Roosevelt]] Administration and created by a bipartisan law signed by [[Dwight Eisenhower]], was transformed into the [[Kennedy Center|John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]],  a living memorial to the assassinated president. Fundraising for the original cultural center had been poor prior to legislation creating the Kennedy Center, which passed two months after the president's death and provided $23 million for construction. The Kennedy Center opened in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wosu.org/archive/jfk/legacy.php |title=Living Legacy: Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts |publisher=WOSU |accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1930s the U.S. Congress mandated a [[Smithsonian Institution]] art museum for the National Mall, and a design by [[Eliel Saarinen]] was unveiled in 1939, but plans were shelved during World War II. A 1966 act of the U.S. Congress established the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] as part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] with a focus on modern art, in contrast to the existing [[National Gallery of Art|National Art Gallery]]. The museum was primarily federally funded, although New York financier [[Joseph Hirshhorn]] later contributed $1 million toward building construction, which began in 1969. The Hirshhorn opened in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hirshhorn.si.edu/museum/story_text.html |title=The Hirshhorn Story |publisher=Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702201156/http://hirshhorn.si.edu/museum/story_text.html |archivedate=July 2, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Transportation===\nTransportation initiatives started during President Johnson's term in office included the consolidation of transportation agencies into a cabinet-level position under the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]].<ref>{{cite web |first=R.

Congress passed a variety of legislation to support improvements in transportation including The [[Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964]] which provided $375 million for large-scale urban public or private rail projects in the form of matching funds to cities and states and created the [[Urban Mass Transit Administration]] (now the [[Federal Transit Administration]]), [[High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965]] which resulted in the creation of [[Metroliner (train)|high-speed rail between New York and Washington]], and the [[National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966]]\u2014a bill largely taken credit for by [[Ralph Nader]], whose book ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]'' he claims helped inspire the legislation.\n\n===Consumer protection===\nIn 1964, Johnson named Assistant Secretary of Labor [[Esther Peterson]] to be the first presidential assistant for consumer affairs.\n\nThe [[Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act]] of 1965 required packages to carry warning labels. The Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 set standards through creation of the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]. The [[Fair Packaging and Labeling Act]] requires products identify manufacturer, address, clearly mark quantity and servings. The statute also authorized the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|HEW]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] to establish and define voluntary standard sizes. The original would have mandated uniform standards of size and weight for comparison shopping, but the final law only outlawed exaggerated size claims.\n\nThe Child Safety Act of 1966 prohibited any chemical so dangerous that no warning can make it safe. The Flammable Fabrics Act of 1967 set standards for children's sleepwear, but not baby blankets.\n\nThe [[Wholesome Meat Act]] of 1967 required inspection of meat which must meet federal standards. The [[Truth-in-Lending Act]] of 1968 required lenders and credit providers to disclose the full cost of finance charges in both dollars and annual percentage rates, on installment loan and sales. The Wholesome Poultry Products Act of 1968 required inspection of poultry which must meet federal standards. The Land Sales Disclosure Act of 1968 provided safeguards against fraudulent practices in the sale of land. The Radiation Safety Act of 1968 provided standards and recalls for defective electronic products.\n\n===The environment===\n[[Joseph A.

Under Title III of the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act, Special Programs to Combat Rural Poverty, the Office for Economic Opportunity was authorized to act as a lender of last resort for rural families who needed money to help them permanently increase their earning capacity. Loans could be made to purchase land, improve the operation of family farms, allow participation in cooperative ventures, and finance non-agricultural business enterprises, while local cooperatives which served low-income rural families could apply for another category of loans for similar purposes.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nTitle III also made loans and grants available to local groups to improve housing, education, and child care services for migrant farm workers, while Titles I and II also included potentially important programs for rural development. Title I established the Job Corps which enrolled school dropouts in community service projects: 40% of the corpsmen were to work in a Youth Conservation Corps to carry out resource conservation, beautification, and development projects in the National Forests and countryside. Arguably more important for rural areas were the Community Action Programs authorized by Title II. Federal money was allocated to States according to their needs for job training, housing, health, and welfare assistance, and the States were then to distribute their shares of the Community Action grants on the basis of proposals from local public or non-profit private groups.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite book |last=Roth |first=Dennis |chapter-url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/ric/ricpubs/rural_development_chap5.pdf |chapter=The Johnson Administration and the Great Society |title=Federal Rural Development Policy in the Twentieth Century |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=August 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824082628/http://www.nal.usda.gov/ric/ricpubs/rural_development_chap5.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 reorganized the Areas Redevelopment Administration (ARA) into the [[Economic Development Administration]] (EDA), and authorized $3.3 billion over 5 years while specifying seven criteria for eligibility. The list included low median family income, but the 6% or higher unemployment applied to the greatest number of areas, while the Act also mentioned outmigration from rural areas as a criterion. In an attempt to go beyond what one writer described as \"ARA's failed scattershot approach\" of providing aid to individual counties and inspired by the European model of regional development, the EDA encouraged counties to form Economic Development Districts (EDDs) as it was recognized that individual distressed counties (called RAs or Redevelopment Areas) lacked sufficient resources for their own development.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nEDDs encompassed from 5 to 15 counties and both planned and implemented development with EDA funding and technical assistance, and each EDD had a \"growth center\" (another concept borrowed from Europe) called a redevelopment center if it was located in an RA or development center if in another county. With the exception of the growth centers, EDD counties were ineligible for assistance unless they were RAs, but they were all expected to benefit from \"coordinated districtwide development planning.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n===Labor===\nThe Amendments made to the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act in 1964 extended the prevailing wage provisions to cover fringe benefits,<ref name=\"illinois.edu\">{{cite journal|last=Bruno |first=Robert |url=http://www.ler.illinois.edu/faculty/papers/bruno-presidentiallabor.pdf |title=Presidential Labor Regimes: Democrats from Roosevelt to Clinton |publisher=University of Illinois |date=January 3\u20135, 1998 |accessdate=August 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821090400/http://www.ler.illinois.edu/faculty/papers/bruno-presidentiallabor.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2013 }}</ref> while several increases were made to the [[federal minimum wage]].<ref>Boosting paychecks: the politics of supporting America's working poor by Daniel Paul Gitterman</ref> The Service Contract Act of 1965 provided for minimum wages and fringe benefits as well as other conditions of work for contractors under certain types of service contracts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xLihciIedlgC&pg=PT125&dq=Service+Contract+Act+(SCA)+in+1965#v=onepage&q=Service%20Contract%20Act%20(SCA)%20in%201965&f=false |title=The COR/COTR Answer Book, Thi - Bob Boyd  |accessdate=August 26, 2013|isbn=9781567263732 |last1=Boyd |first1=Bob |date=August 2012 }}</ref> A comprehensive minimum rate hike was also signed into law that extended the coverage of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] to about 9.1 million additional workers.<ref name=\"illinois.edu\"/>\n\n===Conservative opposition===\n\nIn the 1966 midterm elections, the Republicans made major gains in part through a challenge to the \"War on Poverty.\" Large-scale civic unrest in the inner-city was escalating (reaching a climax in 1968), strengthened demand for [[Law and order (politics)|Law and order]].<ref>Michael W.

It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment. The film stars [[Varun Dhawan]], [[Shraddha Kapoor]], [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nora Fatehi]]. Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.

Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect.
