For the recording, Ginsberg sang pieces from 18th-century English poet [[William Blake]]'s [[Songs of Innocence and Experience|illustrated poetry collection of the same name]] and set them to a [[folk music|folk]]-based [[instrumental idiom]], featuring simple melodies and accompaniment performed with a host of [[jazz]] musicians. Among the album's contributors were trumpeter [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]], arranger/pianist [[Bob Dorough]], multi-instrumentalist [[Jon Sholle]], drummer [[Elvin Jones]], and [[Peter Orlovsky]] \u2013 Ginsberg's life-partner and fellow poet \u2013 who contributed vocals and helped produce the recording with [[UK underground|British underground]] writer [[Barry Miles]].\n\nThe album is one of the most famous attempts at setting lyrics from Blake's ''Songs'' collection to music. Ginsberg, having studied the rhyme and meter of the poems, believed they were originally intended to be sung and that a Blakean musical performance could roughly be replicated. The themes explored in Blake's poems \u2013 childhood and [[child abuse|abuse]], [[organized religion]], [[institutionalization]], and poverty \u2013 connected with Ginsberg spiritually. He was also inspired to undertake the project by a [[religious vision]] of Blake from decades earlier, his witnessing the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity]], and [[rock music]] of [[counterculture of the 1960s|the era's counterculture]].\n\nThe album was first released in 1970 on [[LP record|LP]] by [[MGM Records]] and [[Verve Forecast Records]], selling poorly but receiving critical acclaim. It soon went [[out of print]], while a follow-up release of more Blake recordings, planned with [[Fantasy Records]], never materialized. In 2017, [[Omnivore Recordings]] released ''The Complete Songs of Innocence and Experience'', a double [[compact disc|CD]] featuring the original album and previously unreleased Blakean recordings by Ginsberg from 1971.\n\n== Background ==\n{{quote box|quoted=1|quote=''Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song.''|source=\u2014 [[William Blake]] in \"[[Holy Thursday (Songs of Innocence)|Holy Thursday]]\" (''[[Songs of Innocence]]'', 1789)<ref name=\"mann\"/>|width=18%|align=left|style=padding:8px;}}\n\nIn 1948, Ginsberg experienced what he described as a [[religious vision]] of 18th-century English poet [[William Blake]] appearing in his [[East Harlem]] apartment and reciting poetry to him.<ref name=\"Campbell1999\">{{cite book|author=James Campbell|title=This is the Beat Generation: New York, San Francisco, Paris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xq-AZZ-zXkcC&pg=PA86|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23033-0|pages=86\u2013}}</ref> He was profoundly moved by this experience and inspired to set Blake's poetry to music.<ref name=\"Lawlor2005\">{{cite book|author=William Lawlor|title=Beat Culture: Lifestyles, Icons, and Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMZqLXP01e4C&pg=PA155|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-400-4|pages=155\u2013}}</ref> According to art historian [[Stephen F.

As Ginsberg recalled, \"all the lovely youthful bands that have been wakening the conscience of the world, really, were approaching high poetry and cosmic consciousness in their content, so I was interested in seeing if Blake's highest poetry could be vocalised, tuned, and sung in the context of the Beatles' '[[I Am the Walrus]]' or '[[A Day in the Life|Day in the Life of]]' [''[[sic]]''] or in the context of '[[Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands|Sad-eyed Lady of the Lowland]]' [''sic''] or '[[John Wesley Harding (song)|John Wesley Harding]]' by Dylan.

Fantasy offered them a five-album deal with an [[Advance payment|advance]] and paid studio time to [[Mastering (audio)|master]] the recordings, more than hundred of which Miles had already edited for a series of spoken-word and mantra records. According to Miles, the mastering was to be finished by June 1971, when Ginsberg was planning to leave for Australia. However, Ginsberg complicated the matter by having more tapes mailed to him from the various colleges where his poetry recitals had been recorded.<ref name=\"Miles\"/> In August, Ginsberg sent the master tapes to Fantasy, along with a letter saying he wants to rerecord and remix some of the songs and that he has recorded 16 albums of poems.

For the recording, Ginsberg sang pieces from 18th-century English poet [[William Blake]]'s [[Songs of Innocence and Experience|illustrated poetry collection of the same name]] and set them to a [[folk music|folk]]-based [[instrumental idiom]], featuring simple melodies and accompaniment performed with a host of [[jazz]] musicians. Among the album's contributors were trumpeter [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]], arranger/pianist [[Bob Dorough]], multi-instrumentalist [[Jon Sholle]], drummer [[Elvin Jones]], and [[Peter Orlovsky]] \u2013 Ginsberg's life-partner and fellow poet \u2013 who contributed vocals and helped produce the recording with [[UK underground|British underground]] writer [[Barry Miles]].\n\nThe album is one of the most famous attempts at setting lyrics from Blake's ''Songs'' collection to music. Ginsberg, having studied the rhyme and meter of the poems, believed they were originally intended to be sung and that a Blakean musical performance could roughly be replicated. The themes explored in Blake's poems \u2013 childhood and [[child abuse|abuse]], [[organized religion]], [[institutionalization]], and poverty \u2013 connected with Ginsberg spiritually. He was also inspired to undertake the project by a [[religious vision]] of Blake from decades earlier, his witnessing the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity]], and [[rock music]] of [[counterculture of the 1960s|the era's counterculture]].\n\nThe album was first released in 1970 on [[LP record|LP]] by [[MGM Records]] and [[Verve Forecast Records]], selling poorly but receiving critical acclaim. It soon went [[out of print]], while a follow-up release of more Blake recordings, planned with [[Fantasy Records]], never materialized. In 2017, [[Omnivore Recordings]] released ''The Complete Songs of Innocence and Experience'', a double [[compact disc|CD]] featuring the original album and previously unreleased Blakean recordings by Ginsberg from 1971.\n\n== Background ==\n{{quote box|quoted=1|quote=''Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song.''|source=\u2014 [[William Blake]] in \"[[Holy Thursday (Songs of Innocence)|Holy Thursday]]\" (''[[Songs of Innocence]]'', 1789)<ref name=\"mann\"/>|width=18%|align=left|style=padding:8px;}}\n\nIn 1948, Ginsberg experienced what he described as a [[religious vision]] of 18th-century English poet [[William Blake]] appearing in his [[East Harlem]] apartment and reciting poetry to him.<ref name=\"Campbell1999\">{{cite book|author=James Campbell|title=This is the Beat Generation: New York, San Francisco, Paris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xq-AZZ-zXkcC&pg=PA86|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23033-0|pages=86\u2013}}</ref> He was profoundly moved by this experience and inspired to set Blake's poetry to music.<ref name=\"Lawlor2005\">{{cite book|author=William Lawlor|title=Beat Culture: Lifestyles, Icons, and Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMZqLXP01e4C&pg=PA155|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-400-4|pages=155\u2013}}</ref> According to art historian [[Stephen F.

As Ginsberg recalled, \"all the lovely youthful bands that have been wakening the conscience of the world, really, were approaching high poetry and cosmic consciousness in their content, so I was interested in seeing if Blake's highest poetry could be vocalised, tuned, and sung in the context of the Beatles' '[[I Am the Walrus]]' or '[[A Day in the Life|Day in the Life of]]' [''[[sic]]''] or in the context of '[[Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands|Sad-eyed Lady of the Lowland]]' [''sic''] or '[[John Wesley Harding (song)|John Wesley Harding]]' by Dylan.

However, Ginsberg complicated the matter by having more tapes mailed to him from the various colleges where his poetry recitals had been recorded.<ref name=\"Miles\"/> In August, Ginsberg sent the master tapes to Fantasy, along with a letter saying he wants to rerecord and remix some of the songs and that he has recorded 16 albums of poems. The letter also noted his desire to postpone contract negotiations until he finishes traveling with poet [[Gary Snyder]] to [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|the Sierras]] and to India. The albums were never released.<ref name=\"mecca\"/>\n\nAt the time, Ginsberg also considered making an album of Blake settings with [[David Axelrod (musician)|David Axelrod]], a Los Angeles-based producer and composer best known for his successful tenure at [[Capitol Records]]. Axelrod had released his own instrumental interpretations of Blake's ''Songs'' collection on two albums \u2013 ''[[Song of Innocence]]'' (1968) and ''[[Songs of Experience (David Axelrod album)|Songs of Experience]]'' (1969) \u2013 which fused sounds from [[pop music|pop]], jazz, rock, and [[theater music]]. Ginsberg and Axelrod discussed ideas for a project on several occasions, including an album of both Blake and Ginsberg poems, but it never materialized either due to other pursuits and priorities.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sonksen|first=Mike|date=June 15, 2012|url=https://www.kcet.org/history-society/songs-of-innocence-and-experience-the-tone-poems-of-david-axelrod-and-william-blake|title=Songs of Innocence and Experience: The Tone Poems of David Axelrod and William Blake|website=[[KCET]]|accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe original ''Songs of Innocence and Experience'' eventually went [[out of print]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rolling Stone Album Guide|year=1992|page=283|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0679737294|edition=3rd|editor1=Anthony DeCurtis |editor2=James Henke |editor3=Holly George-Warren |title-link=The Rolling Stone Album Guide}}</ref> and remained so until the release of ''The Complete Songs of Innocence and Experience'' by [[Omnivore Recordings]] on June 23, 2017.

In time, the realm was expanded, primarily through warfare and conquest; at its height, the kingdom stretched from the river Humber (from which the kingdom drew its name) to the Forth. Eventually, factional fighting and the rejuvenated strength of neighbouring kingdoms, most notably Mercia, led to Northumbria's decline.<ref name=\"Gething\" /> The arrival of the Vikings hastened this decline, and the Scandinavian raiders eventually claimed the Deiran part of the kingdom in AD 867 (which became [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]]). The land that would become County Durham now sat on the border with the [[Great Heathen Army]], a border which today still (albeit with some adjustments over the years) forms the boundaries between Yorkshire and County Durham.\n\nDespite their success south of the river Tees, the Vikings never fully conquered the Bernician part of Northumbria, despite the many raids they had carried out on the kingdom.<ref name=\"Gething\" /> However, Viking control over the [[Danelaw]], the central belt of Anglo-Saxon territory, resulted in Northumbria becoming isolated from the rest of Anglo-Saxon Britain. Scots invasions in the north pushed the kingdom's northern boundary back to the [[river Tweed]], and the kingdom found itself reduced to a dependent earldom, its boundaries very close to those of modern-day Northumberland and County Durham. The kingdom was annexed into England in AD 954.\n\n===City of Durham Founded===\n{{Main|Durham, England}}\n\nIn AD 995, St Cuthbert's community, who had been transporting Cuthbert's remains around, partly in an attempt to avoid them falling into the hands of Viking raiders, settled at Dunholm (Durham) on a site that was defensively favourable due to the horseshoe-like path of the River Wear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://englandsnortheast.co.uk/Dunholm995.html|title=Birth of Durham and Reign of Canute|website=englandsnortheast.co.uk}}</ref>  St Cuthbert's remains were placed in a shrine in the White Church, which was originally a wooden structure but was eventually fortified into a stone building.\n\n===County Palatine of Durham===\n{{Main|County Palatine of Durham}}\n\nOnce the City of Durham had been founded, the Bishops of Durham gradually acquired the lands that would become County Durham. Bishop Aldhun began this process by procuring land in the Tees and Wear valleys, including Norton, Stockton, Escomb and Aucklandshire in 1018. In 1031, [[King Canute]] gave Staindrop to the Bishops. This territory continued to expand, and was eventually given the status of a [[Liberty (division)|liberty]]. Under the control of the Bishops of Durham, the land had various names: the \"Liberty of Durham\", \"Liberty of St Cuthbert's Land\" \"the lands of St Cuthbert between Tyne and Tees\" or \"the Liberty of Haliwerfolc\".<ref name=\"scammell\">{{cite journal |jstor = 561658|title = The Origin and Limitations of the Liberty of Durham |journal = The English Historical Review |volume = 81 |issue = 320 |pages = 449\u2013473 |last = Scammell |first = Jean |year = 1966 |doi = 10.1093/ehr/LXXXI.CCCXX.449 }}</ref>\n\nThe bishops' special jurisdiction rested on claims that King [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria]] had granted a substantial territory to [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|St Cuthbert]] on his election to the [[Episcopal see|see]] of [[Lindisfarne]] in 684. In about 883 a cathedral housing the saint's remains was established at [[Chester-le-Street]] and [[Guthfrith, King of York]] granted the community of St Cuthbert the area between the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and the [[River Wear|Wear]], before the community reached its final destination in 995, in Durham.\n\n[[File:Durham Palatinate.JPG|thumb|right|Durham palatinate plaque.]]\n\nFollowing the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]], the administrative machinery of government extended only slowly into northern England.

The crown regarded Durham as falling within Northumberland until the late thirteenth century. Matters came to a head in 1293 when the bishop and his steward failed to attend proceedings of ''[[quo warranto]]'' held by the justices of Northumberland. The bishop's case went before parliament, where he stated that Durham lay outside the bounds of any English shire and that ''\"from time immemorial it had been widely known that the sheriff of Northumberland was not sheriff of Durham nor entered within that liberty as sheriff. . . nor made there proclamations or attachments\"''.<ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.2307/2849417 |jstor=2849417 |title = Edward I of England and the Regalian Franchise of Durham |journal=Speculum |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=329\u2013342 |last = Fraser |first = C.

In effect it was a private shire, with the bishop appointing his own sheriff.<ref name=\"scammell\" /> The area eventually became known as the \"[[County Palatine]] of Durham\".\n\n[[Sadberge (wapentake)|Sadberge]] was a liberty, sometimes referred to as a county, within Northumberland. In 1189 it was purchased for the see but continued with a separate [[sheriff]], [[coroner]] and court of pleas. In the 14th century Sadberge was included in [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]] ward and was itself divided into two wards. The division into the four wards of Chester-le-Street, [[Darlington]], [[Easington District|Easington]] and Stockton existed in the 13th century, each ward having its own coroner and a three-weekly court corresponding to the [[Hundred (division)|hundred]] court. The [[diocese]] was divided into the [[archdeacon]]ries of Durham and Northumberland. The former is mentioned in 1072, and in 1291 included the deaneries of Chester-le-Street, Auckland, [[Lanchester, County Durham|Lanchester]] and Darlington.\n\nThe term ''palatinus'' is applied to the bishop in 1293, and from the 13th century onwards the bishops frequently claimed the same rights in their lands as the king enjoyed in his kingdom.\n\n===Early administration===\n====Overview====\n[[File:Durham - John Speed Map.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The [[Historic counties of England|historic boundaries]] of the county shown in [[John Speed]]'s map of the county in his ''Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine'', {{circa}} 1611.

On the outbreak of the [[English Civil War|Great Rebellion]] in 1642 Durham inclined to support the cause of the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], and in 1640 the high sheriff of the palatinate guaranteed to supply the Scottish army with provisions during their stay in the county. In 1642 the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Earl of Newcastle]] formed the western counties into an association for the King's service, but in 1644 the palatinate was again overrun by a Scottish army, and after the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] (2 July 1644) fell entirely into the hands of the parliament.\n[[File:Durham Castle, April 2017 (2) (33802921566).jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to Durham Castle, the bishops' palace until 1832 when it moved to Auckland Castle]]\nIn 1614 a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was introduced in parliament for securing representation to the county and city of Durham and the borough of [[Barnard Castle]].

The settlement provided educational and social work, as well as hope; this included providing unemployed miners with on outlet for their creativity, a poor person's lawyer service, the town's first library and the Everyman Theatre. The output included paintings, sewing, socially-significant plays, woodwork and sculptures. Several members went on to win adult scholarships at Oxford University <ref name=\"spennymoorsettlement.co.uk\" /> when such a route would normally be closed to the underprivileged. Former members include artists [[Norman Cornish]] and [[Tom McGuinness (artist)|Tom McGuinness]], writer [[Sid Chaplin]] OBE and journalist Arnold Hadwin OBE. The Spennymoor Settlement at its home in the Everyman Theatre (Grade 2 listed) is still operating, administered by the current trustees, offering community events and activities, including Youth Theatre Group, an Art Group and various classes, as well as offering community accommodation facilities.\n\nSeveral Durham miners have been able to turn their former mining careers into careers in art. For example, [[Tom Lamb (artist)|Tom Lamb]], as well as the aforementioned Tom McGuinness and Norman Cornish.

In time, the realm was expanded, primarily through warfare and conquest; at its height, the kingdom stretched from the river Humber (from which the kingdom drew its name) to the Forth. Eventually, factional fighting and the rejuvenated strength of neighbouring kingdoms, most notably Mercia, led to Northumbria's decline.<ref name=\"Gething\" /> The arrival of the Vikings hastened this decline, and the Scandinavian raiders eventually claimed the Deiran part of the kingdom in AD 867 (which became [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]]). The land that would become County Durham now sat on the border with the [[Great Heathen Army]], a border which today still (albeit with some adjustments over the years) forms the boundaries between Yorkshire and County Durham.\n\nDespite their success south of the river Tees, the Vikings never fully conquered the Bernician part of Northumbria, despite the many raids they had carried out on the kingdom.<ref name=\"Gething\" /> However, Viking control over the [[Danelaw]], the central belt of Anglo-Saxon territory, resulted in Northumbria becoming isolated from the rest of Anglo-Saxon Britain. Scots invasions in the north pushed the kingdom's northern boundary back to the [[river Tweed]], and the kingdom found itself reduced to a dependent earldom, its boundaries very close to those of modern-day Northumberland and County Durham. The kingdom was annexed into England in AD 954.\n\n===City of Durham Founded===\n{{Main|Durham, England}}\n\nIn AD 995, St Cuthbert's community, who had been transporting Cuthbert's remains around, partly in an attempt to avoid them falling into the hands of Viking raiders, settled at Dunholm (Durham) on a site that was defensively favourable due to the horseshoe-like path of the River Wear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://englandsnortheast.co.uk/Dunholm995.html|title=Birth of Durham and Reign of Canute|website=englandsnortheast.co.uk}}</ref>  St Cuthbert's remains were placed in a shrine in the White Church, which was originally a wooden structure but was eventually fortified into a stone building.\n\n===County Palatine of Durham===\n{{Main|County Palatine of Durham}}\n\nOnce the City of Durham had been founded, the Bishops of Durham gradually acquired the lands that would become County Durham. Bishop Aldhun began this process by procuring land in the Tees and Wear valleys, including Norton, Stockton, Escomb and Aucklandshire in 1018. In 1031, [[King Canute]] gave Staindrop to the Bishops. This territory continued to expand, and was eventually given the status of a [[Liberty (division)|liberty]]. Under the control of the Bishops of Durham, the land had various names: the \"Liberty of Durham\", \"Liberty of St Cuthbert's Land\" \"the lands of St Cuthbert between Tyne and Tees\" or \"the Liberty of Haliwerfolc\".<ref name=\"scammell\">{{cite journal |jstor = 561658|title = The Origin and Limitations of the Liberty of Durham |journal = The English Historical Review |volume = 81 |issue = 320 |pages = 449\u2013473 |last = Scammell |first = Jean |year = 1966 |doi = 10.1093/ehr/LXXXI.CCCXX.449 }}</ref>\n\nThe bishops' special jurisdiction rested on claims that King [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria]] had granted a substantial territory to [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|St Cuthbert]] on his election to the [[Episcopal see|see]] of [[Lindisfarne]] in 684. In about 883 a cathedral housing the saint's remains was established at [[Chester-le-Street]] and [[Guthfrith, King of York]] granted the community of St Cuthbert the area between the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and the [[River Wear|Wear]], before the community reached its final destination in 995, in Durham.\n\n[[File:Durham Palatinate.JPG|thumb|right|Durham palatinate plaque.]]\n\nFollowing the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]], the administrative machinery of government extended only slowly into northern England.

The crown regarded Durham as falling within Northumberland until the late thirteenth century. Matters came to a head in 1293 when the bishop and his steward failed to attend proceedings of ''[[quo warranto]]'' held by the justices of Northumberland. The bishop's case went before parliament, where he stated that Durham lay outside the bounds of any English shire and that ''\"from time immemorial it had been widely known that the sheriff of Northumberland was not sheriff of Durham nor entered within that liberty as sheriff. . . nor made there proclamations or attachments\"''.<ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.2307/2849417 |jstor=2849417 |title = Edward I of England and the Regalian Franchise of Durham |journal=Speculum |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=329\u2013342 |last = Fraser |first = C. M. | year=1956 }}</ref> The arguments appear to have prevailed, as by the fourteenth century Durham was accepted as a liberty which received royal mandates direct. In effect it was a private shire, with the bishop appointing his own sheriff.<ref name=\"scammell\" /> The area eventually became known as the \"[[County Palatine]] of Durham\".\n\n[[Sadberge (wapentake)|Sadberge]] was a liberty, sometimes referred to as a county, within Northumberland. In 1189 it was purchased for the see but continued with a separate [[sheriff]], [[coroner]] and court of pleas. In the 14th century Sadberge was included in [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]] ward and was itself divided into two wards. The division into the four wards of Chester-le-Street, [[Darlington]], [[Easington District|Easington]] and Stockton existed in the 13th century, each ward having its own coroner and a three-weekly court corresponding to the [[Hundred (division)|hundred]] court. The [[diocese]] was divided into the [[archdeacon]]ries of Durham and Northumberland. The former is mentioned in 1072, and in 1291 included the deaneries of Chester-le-Street, Auckland, [[Lanchester, County Durham|Lanchester]] and Darlington.\n\nThe term ''palatinus'' is applied to the bishop in 1293, and from the 13th century onwards the bishops frequently claimed the same rights in their lands as the king enjoyed in his kingdom.\n\n===Early administration===\n====Overview====\n[[File:Durham - John Speed Map.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The [[Historic counties of England|historic boundaries]] of the county shown in [[John Speed]]'s map of the county in his ''Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine'', {{circa}} 1611.

Other officers included the sheriff, the coroners, the [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] and the [[chancellor]]. The palatine exchequer originated in the 12th century. The palatine assembly represented the whole county, and dealt chiefly with fiscal questions. The bishop's council, consisting of the clergy, the sheriff and the [[baron]]s, regulated judicial affairs, and later produced the [[Court of equity|Chancery]] and the courts of [[Admiralty court|Admiralty]] and [[Marshalsea Court|Marshalsea]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Durham Castle, April 2017 (2) (33802921566).jpg|thumb|The entrance to Durham Castle, the bishops' palace until 1832 when it moved to Auckland Castle]]\n\nThe [[prior]] of Durham ranked first among the bishop's barons.

The repeated efforts of [[the Crown]] to check the powers of the palatinate bishops culminated in 1536 in the Act of Resumption, which deprived the bishop of the power to pardon offences against the law or to appoint judicial officers. Moreover, indictments and legal processes were in future to run in the name of the king, and offences to be described as against the peace of the king, rather than that of the bishop. In 1596 restrictions were imposed{{by whom|date=June 2016}} on the powers of the chancery, and in 1646 the palatinate was formally abolished. It was revived, however, after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], and continued with much the same power until 5 July 1836, when the [[Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836]] provided that the palatine jurisdiction should in future be vested in the Crown.<ref>The [[Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836]] (6 & 7 Will 4 c 19)</ref><ref>{{cite book |date=1836 |title=The Statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland |url=https://archive.org/details/statutesunitedk34britgoog |quote=bishop of durham   temporal Powers by Palatine  Act 1836. |location= |publisher=His Majesty's Statute and Law Printers|page=[https://archive.org/details/statutesunitedk34britgoog/page/n164 130]}}</ref>\n\n==== 15th century to the modern era ====\n\nDuring the 15th-century [[Wars of the Roses]], [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] passed through Durham.

In 1642 the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Earl of Newcastle]] formed the western counties into an association for the King's service, but in 1644 the palatinate was again overrun by a Scottish army, and after the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] (2 July 1644) fell entirely into the hands of the parliament.\n[[File:Durham Castle, April 2017 (2) (33802921566).jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to Durham Castle, the bishops' palace until 1832 when it moved to Auckland Castle]]\nIn 1614 a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was introduced in parliament for securing representation to the county and city of Durham and the borough of [[Barnard Castle]].

Tens of thousands of people migrated to County Durham from Cornwall (partly due to their previous experience of tin mining) between 1815 and the outbreak of the First World War, so much so that the miners' cottages in east Durham called \"Greenhill\" were also known locally as \"Cornwall\", and Easington Colliery still has a Cornish Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalzoom.com/article.cfm?articleid=13984|title=Coal Zoom &#124; The Cornish in County Durham, England: How 19th Century Mining Migration Shaped the Region|website=www.coalzoom.com}}</ref> Other migrants included people from Northumberland, Cumberland, South Wales, Scotland and Ireland.<ref name=\"co-curate.ncl.ac.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/irish-migration-to-north-east-england/|title=Irish migration to North East England &#124; Co-Curate|website=co-curate.ncl.ac.uk}}</ref> <ref>{{cite book |last1=Griffiths |title=A dictionary of North East dialect |publisher=Northumbria Press |isbn=9781904794400 |edition=Thirdition|year=2011 }}</ref>Coal mining had a profound effect on trade unionism, public health and housing, as well as creating a related culture, language, folklore and sense of identity that still survives today.<ref name=\"durhamintime.org.uk\"/>\n\nThe migrants also were employed in the railway, ship building, iron, steel and roadworking industries, and the pattern of migration continued, to a lesser extent, up until the 1950s and 1960s.

Today no deep-coal mines exist in the county and numbers attending the Miners' Gala decreased over the period between the end of the strike and the 21st century.

The settlement, initially funded by the [[Pilgrim Trust]], aimed to encourage people to be neighbourly and participate in voluntary social service.<ref name=\"spennymoorsettlement.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.spennymoorsettlement.co.uk/history.html|title=History|website=www.spennymoorsettlement.co.uk}}</ref> The settlement operated during the [[Great Depression]], when unemployment was widespread and economic deprivation rife; Spennymoor was economically underprivileged. The settlement provided educational and social work, as well as hope; this included providing unemployed miners with on outlet for their creativity, a poor person's lawyer service, the town's first library and the Everyman Theatre. The output included paintings, sewing, socially-significant plays, woodwork and sculptures. Several members went on to win adult scholarships at Oxford University <ref name=\"spennymoorsettlement.co.uk\" /> when such a route would normally be closed to the underprivileged. Former members include artists [[Norman Cornish]] and [[Tom McGuinness (artist)|Tom McGuinness]], writer [[Sid Chaplin]] OBE and journalist Arnold Hadwin OBE. The Spennymoor Settlement at its home in the Everyman Theatre (Grade 2 listed) is still operating, administered by the current trustees, offering community events and activities, including Youth Theatre Group, an Art Group and various classes, as well as offering community accommodation facilities.\n\nSeveral Durham miners have been able to turn their former mining careers into careers in art. For example, [[Tom Lamb (artist)|Tom Lamb]], as well as the aforementioned Tom McGuinness and Norman Cornish. Their artworks depict scenes of life underground, from the streets in which they lived and of the people they loved; through them, we can see, understand and experience the mining culture of County Durham.\n\nIn 2017, The Mining Art Gallery opened in Bishop Auckland in a building that was once a bank.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/11/museum-of-miners-art-to-open-as-part-of-bishop-auckland-culture-drive|title=Museum of miners' art to open as part of Bishop Auckland culture drive|first=Maev|last=Kennedy|date=11 September 2017|via=www.theguardian.com|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Part of the Auckland Project, the gallery includes the work of artists from within County Durham and beyond, including such other North-Eastern mining artists as [[Robert Olley]], as well as contributions from outside the region.

Bede made references to harp-playing, and abundant archeological evidence has been found of wooden flutes, bone flutes, panpipes, wooden drums and lyres (a six-string form of harp).<ref name=\"Gething\" /> North-East England has a distinctive folk music style that has drawn from many other regions, including southern Scotland, Ireland and the rest of northern England, that has endured stably since the 18th century.<ref>S.

The project aims to assist people living in the city to share their stories about seeking sanctuary in the North East through photography, stories, poetry and music. The art is based on a history of sanctuary in Durham, from St Cuthbert's exile, through to the miners' strike of 1984, and to refugees escaping civil war in the Middle East.

{"title_page": "Graeco-Latin square", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=November 2010}}\nIn [[combinatorics]], a '''Graeco-Latin square''' or '''Euler square''' or pair of '''orthogonal Latin squares''' of order ''n'' over two [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s ''S'' and ''T'', each consisting of ''n'' symbols, is an ''n''&times;''n'' arrangement of cells, each cell containing an [[ordered pair]] (''s'',''t''), where ''s'' is in ''S'' and ''t'' is in ''T'', such that every row and every column contains each element of ''S'' and each element of ''T'' exactly once, and that no two cells contain the same ordered pair.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Orthogonal Latin squares\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nGraecoLatinSquare-Order3.svg|Order 3\nGrecoLatinSquare-Order4.svg|Order 4\nGraecoLatinSquare-Order5.png|Order 5\n</gallery>\n\nThe arrangement of the ''s''-coordinates by themselves (which may be thought of as Latin characters) and of the ''t''-coordinates (the Greek characters) each forms a [[Latin square]]. A Graeco-Latin square can therefore be decomposed into two \"[[Orthogonality#Combinatorics|orthogonal]]\" Latin squares. Orthogonality here means that every pair (''s'',&nbsp;''t'') from the [[Cartesian product]] ''S''&times;''T'' occurs exactly once.\n\n==History==\nOrthogonal Latin squares have been known to predate Euler. As described by [[Donald Knuth]] in Volume 4A, p.&nbsp;3 of [[TAOCP]],<ref>[https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=IkuEBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT28 The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4A: Combinatorial Algorithms, Orthogonal latin squares.]</ref> the construction of 4x4 set was published by [[Jacques Ozanam]] in 1725 (in ''Recreation mathematiques et physiques'', Vol. IV)<ref>[https://archive.org/details/nquicontiennent00ozangoog/page/n447 ''Recreation mathematiques et physiques'', Vol. IV, p. 434], the solution is in [https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=6JP6Hz5EHYQC&pg=PA476 Fig. 35]</ref> as a puzzle involving [[playing card]]s. The problem was to take all aces, kings, queens and jacks from a standard deck of cards, and arrange them in a 4x4 grid such that each row and each column contained all four suits as well as one of each face value. This problem has several solutions.\n\nA common variant of this problem was to arrange the 16 cards so that, in addition to the row and column constraints, each diagonal contains all four face values and all four suits as well.\n\nAccording to [[Martin Gardner]], who featured this problem in his November 1959 [[Mathematical Games column]], the number of distinct solutions was incorrectly stated to be 72 by [[Rouse Ball]]. This mistake persisted for many years until the correct value of 144 was found by [[Kathleen Ollerenshaw]]. Each of the 144 solutions has eight reflections and rotations, giving 1152 solutions in total. The 144&times;8 solutions can be categorized into the following two [[equivalence class]]es:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-family:'DejaVu Sans Mono','Bitstream Vera Sans Mono','Courier New','Andale Mono','monospace'\"\n!width=\"200\"|Solution\n!width=\"200\"|Normal form\n|-\n!Solution #1\n|align=\"center\"|{{\u2660|A}} {{\u2665|K}} {{\u2666|Q}} {{\u2663|J}}<br/>{{\u2663|Q}} {{\u2666|J}} {{\u2665|A}} {{\u2660|K}}<br/>{{\u2665|J}} {{\u2660|Q}} {{\u2663|K}} {{\u2666|A}}<br/>{{\u2666|K}} {{\u2663|A}} {{\u2660|J}} {{\u2665|Q}}<br/>\n|-\n!Solution #2\n|align=\"center\"|{{\u2660|A}} {{\u2665|K}} {{\u2666|Q}} {{\u2663|J}}<br/>{{\u2666|J}} {{\u2663|Q}} {{\u2660|K}} {{\u2665|A}}<br/>{{\u2663|K}} {{\u2666|A}} {{\u2665|J}} {{\u2660|Q}}<br/>{{\u2665|Q}} {{\u2660|J}} {{\u2663|A}} {{\u2666|K}}<br/>\n|}\n\nFor each of the two solutions, 24&times;24 = 576 solutions can be derived by permuting the four suits and the four face values independently. No permutation will convert the two solutions into each other.\n\nThe solution set can be seen to be complete through this proof outline:\n# [[Without loss of generality]], let us choose the card in the top left corner to be {{\u2660|A}}.\n# In the second row, the first two cells can be neither ace nor spades, due to being on the same column or diagonal respectively. Therefore, one of the remaining two cells must be an ace, and the other must be a spade, since the card {{\u2660|A}} itself cannot be repeated.\n# If we choose the cell in the second row, third column to be an ace, and [[constraint propagation|propagate the constraints]], we get Solution #1 above, [[up to]] a permutation of the remaining suits and face values.\n# Conversely, if we choose the (2,3) cell to be a spade, and propagate the constraints, we get Solution #2 above, [[up to]] a permutation of the remaining suits and face values.\n# Since no other possibilities exist for (2,3), the solution set is complete.\n\n===Euler's conjecture and disproof===\nOrthogonal Latin squares were studied in detail by [[Leonhard Euler]], who took the two sets to be ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''A'',&nbsp;''B'',&nbsp;''C'',&nbsp;...}, the first ''n'' upper-case letters from the [[Latin alphabet]], and ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{\u03b1&nbsp;,&nbsp;\u03b2,&nbsp;\u03b3,&nbsp;...},\nthe first ''n'' lower-case letters from the [[Greek alphabet]]&mdash;hence the name Graeco-Latin square.\n\nIn the 1780s Euler demonstrated methods for constructing Graeco-Latin squares where ''n'' is odd or a multiple of 4.<ref>Euler: [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/pages/E530.html ''Recherches sur une nouvelle espece de quarres magiques''], [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/date-write.html written in 1779], [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/date-publish.html published in 1782]</ref>  Observing that no order-2 square exists and being unable to construct an order-6 square (see [[thirty-six officers problem]]), he conjectured that none exist for any [[singly and doubly even|oddly even]] number {{nowrap|''n'' \u2261 2 ([[modular arithmetic|mod]] 4).}} The non-existence of order-6 squares was confirmed in 1901 by [[Gaston Tarry]] through a [[proof by exhaustion]].  However, Euler's conjecture resisted solution until the late 1950s.\n\nIn 1959, [[Raj Chandra Bose|R.C. Bose]] and [[S. S. Shrikhande]] constructed some counterexamples (dubbed the ''Euler spoilers'') of order 22 using mathematical insights. Then [[E. T. Parker]] found a counterexample of order 10 using a one-hour computer search on a [[UNIVAC 1206]] Military Computer while working at the [[UNIVAC]] division of [[Remington Rand]] (this was one of the earliest [[combinatorics]] problems solved on a [[digital computer]]).\n\nIn April 1959, Parker, Bose, and Shrikhande presented their paper showing Euler's conjecture to be false for all {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 10.}} Thus, Graeco-Latin squares exist for all orders ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;3 except {{nowrap|1 = ''n'' = 6.}}\n\n==Applications==\nGraeco-Latin squares are used in the [[design of experiments]], [[Playoff format|tournament scheduling]], and constructing [[magic square]]s. The French writer [[Georges Perec]] structured his 1978 novel [[Life: A User's Manual]] around a 10&times;10 Graeco-Latin square.\n\n==Mutually orthogonal Latin squares==\nA set of Latin squares is called '''mutually orthogonal''' or '''pairwise orthogonal''' if each Latin square in the set is pairwise orthogonal to all other Latin squares of the set.\n\n{|style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; font-size:200%; height:200px; width:300px\"\n|+style=\"font-size:50%\" | Any two of text, foreground color, background color and typeface form a pair of orthogonal Latin squares:\n|-\n|style=\"background:black; color:white; font-family:georgia, times, serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | fjords\n|style=\"background:maroon; color:red; font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | jawbox\n|style=\"background:teal; color:lime; font-family:courier new, courier, monospace; font-weight:bold\" align=center | phlegm\n|style=\"background:navy; color:blue; font-family:comic sans ms, cursive; font-weight:bold\" align=center | qiviut\n|style=\"background:silver; color:yellow; font-family:impact, charcoal, fantasy; font-weight:bold\" align=center | zincky\n|-\n|style=\"background:maroon; color:lime; font-family:comic sans ms, cursive; font-weight:bold\" align=center | zincky\n|style=\"background:teal; color:blue; font-family:impact, charcoal, fantasy; font-weight:bold\" align=center | fjords\n|style=\"background:navy; color:yellow; font-family:georgia, times, serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | jawbox\n|style=\"background:silver; color:white; font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | phlegm\n|style=\"background:black; color:red; font-family:courier new, courier, monospace; font-weight:bold\" align=center | qiviut\n|-\n|style=\"background:teal; color:yellow; font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | qiviut\n|style=\"background:navy; color:white; font-family:courier new, courier, monospace; font-weight:bold\" align=center | zincky\n|style=\"background:silver; color:red; font-family:comic sans ms, cursive; font-weight:bold\" align=center | fjords\n|style=\"background:black; color:lime; font-family:impact, charcoal, fantasy; font-weight:bold\" align=center | jawbox\n|style=\"background:maroon; color:blue; font-family:georgia, times, serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | phlegm\n|-\n|style=\"background:navy; color:red; font-family:impact, charcoal, fantasy; font-weight:bold\" align=center | phlegm\n|style=\"background:silver; color:lime; font-family:georgia, times, serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | qiviut\n|style=\"background:black; color:blue; font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | zincky\n|style=\"background:maroon; color:yellow; font-family:courier new, courier, monospace; font-weight:bold\" align=center | fjords\n|style=\"background:teal; color:white; font-family:comic sans ms, cursive; font-weight:bold\" align=center | jawbox\n|-\n|style=\"background:silver; color:blue; font-family:courier new, courier, monospace; font-weight:bold\" align=center | jawbox\n|style=\"background:black; color:yellow; font-family:comic sans ms, cursive; font-weight:bold\" align=center | phlegm\n|style=\"background:maroon; color:white; font-family:impact, charcoal, fantasy; font-weight:bold\" align=center | qiviut\n|style=\"background:teal; color:red; font-family:georgia, times, serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | zincky\n|style=\"background:navy; color:lime; font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | fjords\n|}\n\nThe above table shows four mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order 5, representing respectively:\n* the text: ''[[fjord]]s'', ''[[jawbox]]'', ''[[phlegm]]'', ''[[qiviut]]'', and ''[[zinc]]ky''\n* the foreground color: [[white]], [[red]], [[Lime (color)|lime]], [[blue]], and [[yellow]]\n* the background color: [[black]], [[maroon]], [[teal]], [[Navy blue|navy]], and [[silver (color)|silver]]\n* the typeface: serif ([[Georgia (typeface)|Georgia]] / [[Times Roman]]), sans-serif ([[Verdana]] / [[Helvetica]]), monospace ([[Courier New]]), cursive ([[Comic Sans]]), and fantasy ([[Impact (typeface)|Impact]]).\n\nDue to the Latin square property, each row and each column has all five texts, all five foregrounds, all five backgrounds, and all five typefaces. These properties may be thought of as ''dimensions'' along which a value may vary.\n\nDue to mutual orthogonality, there is exactly one instance somewhere in the table for any pair of elements, such as (white foreground, monospace), or (''fjords'', navy background) etc., and also all possible such pairs of values of distinct \"dimensions\" are represented exactly once each.\n\nThe above table therefore allows for testing five values in each of four different \"dimensions\" in only 25 observations instead of 625 (= 5<sup>4</sup>) observations. Also note that the five 6-letter words (''fjords'', ''jawbox'', ''phlegm'', ''qiviut'', and ''zincky'') between them cover all 26 letters of the alphabet at least once each. The table therefore allows for examining each letter of the alphabet in five different typefaces, foreground colors, and background colors.\n\nDue to a close relation between orthogonal Latin squares and [[combinatorial design]]s, every pair of distinct cells in the 5x5 table will have exactly one of the following properties in common:\n* a common row, or\n* a common column, or\n* a common text, or\n* a common typeface, or\n* a common background color, or\n* a common foreground color.\n\nIn each category, every cell has four neighbors (four neighbors in the same row with nothing else in common, four in the same column, etc.), giving 6 * 4 = 24 neighbors, which makes it a complete graph with six different edge colors.\n\n===The number of mutually orthogonal latin squares===\nThe number of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) that may exist for a given order ''n'' is not known for general ''n'', and is an area of research in [[combinatorics]]. It is known that the maximum number of MOLS for any ''n'' cannot exceed ''n'' &minus; 1, and this upper bound is achieved when ''n'' is a [[exponentiation|power]] of a [[prime number]]. A set of ''n'' - 1 MOLS is equivalent to a [[finite projective plane]] of order ''n''. The minimum is known to be 2 for all ''n'' except for ''n'' = 2 or 6, where it is 1. For large enough ''n'', the number of MOLS is greater than <math>\\sqrt[14.8]{n}</math>, thus for every ''k'', there are only a finite number of ''n'' such that the number of MOLS is ''k''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/design-theory/0DED6E91AC297F825256C649C76D87F8|title=Design Theory by Thomas Beth|last=Lenz|first=H.|last2=Jungnickel|first2=D.|date=November 1999|website=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139507660|access-date=2019-07-06|last3=Beth|first3=Thomas}}</ref> Moreover, the minimum is 6 for all ''n'' > 90. For general composite numbers, the number of MOLS is not known. The first few values starting with ''n'' = 2, 3, 4... are 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 7, 8, ... {{OEIS|A001438}}.\n\n===Orthogonal arrays===\nAn [[orthogonal array]] of strength 2 and index 1 is a tabular form used to represent sets of MOLS.

The 144&times;8 solutions can be categorized into the following two [[equivalence class]]es:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-family:'DejaVu Sans Mono','Bitstream Vera Sans Mono','Courier New','Andale Mono','monospace'\"\n!width=\"200\"|Solution\n!width=\"200\"|Normal form\n|-\n!Solution #1\n|align=\"center\"|{{\u2660|A}} {{\u2665|K}} {{\u2666|Q}} {{\u2663|J}}<br/>{{\u2663|Q}} {{\u2666|J}} {{\u2665|A}} {{\u2660|K}}<br/>{{\u2665|J}} {{\u2660|Q}} {{\u2663|K}} {{\u2666|A}}<br/>{{\u2666|K}} {{\u2663|A}} {{\u2660|J}} {{\u2665|Q}}<br/>\n|-\n!Solution #2\n|align=\"center\"|{{\u2660|A}} {{\u2665|K}} {{\u2666|Q}} {{\u2663|J}}<br/>{{\u2666|J}} {{\u2663|Q}} {{\u2660|K}} {{\u2665|A}}<br/>{{\u2663|K}} {{\u2666|A}} {{\u2665|J}} {{\u2660|Q}}<br/>{{\u2665|Q}} {{\u2660|J}} {{\u2663|A}} {{\u2666|K}}<br/>\n|}\n\nFor each of the two solutions, 24&times;24 = 576 solutions can be derived by permuting the four suits and the four face values independently. No permutation will convert the two solutions into each other.\n\nThe solution set can be seen to be complete through this proof outline:\n# [[Without loss of generality]], let us choose the card in the top left corner to be {{\u2660|A}}.\n# In the second row, the first two cells can be neither ace nor spades, due to being on the same column or diagonal respectively. Therefore, one of the remaining two cells must be an ace, and the other must be a spade, since the card {{\u2660|A}} itself cannot be repeated.\n# If we choose the cell in the second row, third column to be an ace, and [[constraint propagation|propagate the constraints]], we get Solution #1 above, [[up to]] a permutation of the remaining suits and face values.\n# Conversely, if we choose the (2,3) cell to be a spade, and propagate the constraints, we get Solution #2 above, [[up to]] a permutation of the remaining suits and face values.\n# Since no other possibilities exist for (2,3), the solution set is complete.\n\n===Euler's conjecture and disproof===\nOrthogonal Latin squares were studied in detail by [[Leonhard Euler]], who took the two sets to be ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''A'',&nbsp;''B'',&nbsp;''C'',&nbsp;\u2026}, the first ''n'' upper-case letters from the [[Latin alphabet]], and ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{\u03b1&nbsp;,&nbsp;\u03b2,&nbsp;\u03b3,&nbsp;\u2026},\nthe first ''n'' lower-case letters from the [[Greek alphabet]]&mdash;hence the name Graeco-Latin square.\n\nIn the 1780s Euler demonstrated methods for constructing Graeco-Latin squares where ''n'' is odd or a multiple of 4.<ref>Euler: [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/pages/E530.html ''Recherches sur une nouvelle espece de quarres magiques''], [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/date-write.html written in 1779], [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/date-publish.html published in 1782]</ref>  Observing that no order-2 square exists and being unable to construct an order-6 square (see [[thirty-six officers problem]]), he conjectured that none exist for any [[singly and doubly even|oddly even]] number {{nowrap|''n'' \u2261 2 ([[modular arithmetic|mod]] 4).}} The non-existence of order-6 squares was confirmed in 1901 by [[Gaston Tarry]] through a [[proof by exhaustion]].  However, Euler's conjecture resisted solution until the late 1950s.\n\nIn 1959, [[Raj Chandra Bose|R.C. Bose]] and [[S. S. Shrikhande]] constructed some counterexamples (dubbed the ''Euler spoilers'') of order 22 using mathematical insights. Then [[E. T. Parker]] found a counterexample of order 10 using a one-hour computer search on a [[UNIVAC 1206]] Military Computer while working at the [[UNIVAC]] division of [[Remington Rand]] (this was one of the earliest [[combinatorics]] problems solved on a [[digital computer]]).\n\nIn April 1959, Parker, Bose, and Shrikhande presented their paper showing Euler's conjecture to be false for all {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 10.}} Thus, Graeco-Latin squares exist for all orders ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;3 except {{nowrap|1 = ''n'' = 6.}}\n\n==Applications==\nGraeco-Latin squares are used in the [[design of experiments]], [[Playoff format|tournament scheduling]], and constructing [[magic square]]s. The French writer [[Georges Perec]] structured his 1978 novel [[Life: A User's Manual]] around a 10&times;10 Graeco-Latin square.\n\n==Mutually orthogonal Latin squares==\nA set of Latin squares is called '''mutually orthogonal''' or '''pairwise orthogonal''' if each Latin square in the set is pairwise orthogonal to all other Latin squares of the set.\n\n{|style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; font-size:200%; height:200px; width:300px\"\n|+style=\"font-size:50%\" | Any two of text, foreground color, background color and typeface form a pair of orthogonal Latin squares:\n|-\n|style=\"background:black; color:white; font-family:georgia, times, serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | fjords\n|style=\"background:maroon; color:red; font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | jawbox\n|style=\"background:teal; color:lime; font-family:courier new, courier, monospace; font-weight:bold\" align=center | phlegm\n|style=\"background:navy; color:blue; font-family:comic sans ms, cursive; font-weight:bold\" align=center | qiviut\n|style=\"background:silver; color:yellow; font-family:impact, charcoal, fantasy; font-weight:bold\" align=center | zincky\n|-\n|style=\"background:maroon; color:lime; font-family:comic sans ms, cursive; font-weight:bold\" align=center | zincky\n|style=\"background:teal; color:blue; font-family:impact, charcoal, fantasy; font-weight:bold\" align=center | fjords\n|style=\"background:navy; color:yellow; font-family:georgia, times, serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | jawbox\n|style=\"background:silver; color:white; font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | phlegm\n|style=\"background:black; color:red; font-family:courier new, courier, monospace; font-weight:bold\" align=center | qiviut\n|-\n|style=\"background:teal; color:yellow; font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | qiviut\n|style=\"background:navy; color:white; font-family:courier new, courier, monospace; font-weight:bold\" align=center | zincky\n|style=\"background:silver; color:red; font-family:comic sans ms, cursive; font-weight:bold\" align=center | fjords\n|style=\"background:black; color:lime; font-family:impact, charcoal, fantasy; font-weight:bold\" align=center | jawbox\n|style=\"background:maroon; color:blue; font-family:georgia, times, serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | phlegm\n|-\n|style=\"background:navy; color:red; font-family:impact, charcoal, fantasy; font-weight:bold\" align=center | phlegm\n|style=\"background:silver; color:lime; font-family:georgia, times, serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | qiviut\n|style=\"background:black; color:blue; font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | zincky\n|style=\"background:maroon; color:yellow; font-family:courier new, courier, monospace; font-weight:bold\" align=center | fjords\n|style=\"background:teal; color:white; font-family:comic sans ms, cursive; font-weight:bold\" align=center | jawbox\n|-\n|style=\"background:silver; color:blue; font-family:courier new, courier, monospace; font-weight:bold\" align=center | jawbox\n|style=\"background:black; color:yellow; font-family:comic sans ms, cursive; font-weight:bold\" align=center | phlegm\n|style=\"background:maroon; color:white; font-family:impact, charcoal, fantasy; font-weight:bold\" align=center | qiviut\n|style=\"background:teal; color:red; font-family:georgia, times, serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | zincky\n|style=\"background:navy; color:lime; font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold\" align=center | fjords\n|}\n\nThe above table shows four mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order 5, representing respectively:\n* the text: ''[[fjord]]s'', ''[[jawbox]]'', ''[[phlegm]]'', ''[[qiviut]]'', and ''[[zinc]]ky''\n* the foreground color: [[white]], [[red]], [[Lime (color)|lime]], [[blue]], and [[yellow]]\n* the background color: [[black]], [[maroon]], [[teal]], [[Navy blue|navy]], and [[silver]]\n* the typeface: serif ([[Georgia (typeface)|Georgia]] / [[Times Roman]]), sans-serif ([[Verdana]] / [[Helvetica]]), monospace ([[Courier New]]), cursive ([[Comic Sans]]), and fantasy ([[Impact (typeface)|Impact]]).\n\nDue to the Latin square property, each row and each column has all five texts, all five foregrounds, all five backgrounds, and all five typefaces. These properties may be thought of as ''dimensions'' along which a value may vary.\n\nDue to mutual orthogonality, there is exactly one instance somewhere in the table for any pair of elements, such as (white foreground, monospace), or (''fjords'', navy background) etc., and also all possible such pairs of values of distinct \"dimensions\" are represented exactly once each.\n\nThe above table therefore allows for testing five values in each of four different \"dimensions\" in only 25 observations instead of 625 (= 5<sup>4</sup>) observations. Also note that the five 6-letter words (''fjords'', ''jawbox'', ''phlegm'', ''qiviut'', and ''zincky'') between them cover all 26 letters of the alphabet at least once each. The table therefore allows for examining each letter of the alphabet in five different typefaces, foreground colors, and background colors.\n\nDue to a close relation between orthogonal Latin squares and [[combinatorial design]]s, every pair of distinct cells in the 5x5 table will have exactly one of the following properties in common:\n* a common row, or\n* a common column, or\n* a common text, or\n* a common typeface, or\n* a common background color, or\n* a common foreground color.\n\nIn each category, every cell has four neighbors (four neighbors in the same row with nothing else in common, four in the same column, etc.), giving 6 * 4 = 24 neighbors, which makes it a complete graph with six different edge colors.\n\n===The number of mutually orthogonal latin squares===\nThe number of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) that may exist for a given order ''n'' is not known for general ''n'', and is an area of research in [[combinatorics]]. It is known that the maximum number of MOLS for any ''n'' cannot exceed ''n'' &minus; 1, and this upper bound is achieved when ''n'' is a [[exponentiation|power]] of a [[prime number]]. A set of ''n'' - 1 MOLS is equivalent to a [[finite projective plane]] of order ''n''. The minimum is known to be 2 for all ''n'' except for ''n'' = 2 or 6, where it is 1. For large enough ''n'', the number of MOLS is greater than <math>\\sqrt[14.8]{n}</math>, thus for every ''k'', there are only a finite number of ''n'' such that the number of MOLS is ''k''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/design-theory/0DED6E91AC297F825256C649C76D87F8|title=Design Theory by Thomas Beth|last=Lenz|first=H.|last2=Jungnickel|first2=D.|date=November 1999|website=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139507660|access-date=2019-07-06|last3=Beth|first3=Thomas}}</ref> Moreover, the minimum is 6 for all ''n'' > 90. For general composite numbers, the number of MOLS is not known. The first few values starting with ''n'' = 2, 3, 4... are 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 7, 8, ... {{OEIS|A001438}}.\n\n===Orthogonal arrays===\nAn [[orthogonal array]] of strength 2 and index 1 is a tabular form used to represent sets of MOLS. More general orthogonal arrays represent generalizations of the concept of MOLS, such as mutually orthogonal Latin cubes.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Block design]]\n*[[Blocking (statistics)]]\n*[[Combinatorial design]]\n*[[Design of experiments]]\n*[[Hyper-Graeco-Latin square design]]\n*[[Orthogonal array]]\n*[[Randomized block design]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{cite book \n| title = Constructions and Combinatorial Problems in Design of Experiments \n| author = [[Damaraju Raghavarao|Raghavarao, Damaraju]] \n| location = New York \n| year = 1988 \n| edition = corrected reprint of the 1971 Wiley \n| publisher = Dover }}\n* {{cite book \n| title = Block Designs: Analysis, Combinatorics and Applications \n| author = [[Damaraju Raghavarao|Raghavarao, Damaraju]] and Padgett, L.V. \n| location = \n| year = 2005 \n| edition = \n| publisher = World Scientific }}\n* {{cite book \n|author1=Street, Anne Penfold |author1-link= Anne Penfold Street |author2=Street, Deborah J. \n| title = Combinatorics of Experimental Design \n| publisher = Oxford U.
