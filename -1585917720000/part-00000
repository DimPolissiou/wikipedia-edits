The centre of the island is an ice-filled crater of an inactive [[volcano]]. Some [[Skerry|skerries]] and one smaller island, [[Lars\u00f8ya]], lie along the coast. Nyr\u00f8ysa, created by a [[rock slide]] in the late 1950s, is the only easy place to land and is the location of a [[weather station]].\n\nThe island was first spotted on 1 January 1739 by Frenchman [[Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier]], on a [[France|French]] exploration mission in the [[South Atlantic]] with the ships ''Aigle'' and ''Marie''. They did not make a landfall, and he mislabeled the coordinates for the island and the island was not sighted again until 1808, when the [[British people|British]] [[whaler]] captain James Lindsay named it '''Lindsay Island'''.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia|author=Mills, W.J.|date=2003|volume=1|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576074220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C|page=96}}</ref> The first claim of landing, although disputed, was by American sailor [[Benjamin Morrell]]. In 1825, the island was claimed for the [[British Crown]] by George Norris, who named it '''Liverpool Island'''. He also reported [[Thompson Island (South Atlantic)|Thompson Island]] as nearby, although this was later shown to be a [[phantom island]]. The [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen#The Norvegia expeditions|first ''Norvegia'' expedition]] landed on the island in 1927 and claimed it for Norway.

However, the British position was weakened by Norris's sighting of two islands and the uncertainty as to whether he had been on Thompson or Liverpool (i.e. Bouvet) Island. Norris's positioning deviating from the correct location combined with the island's small size and lack of a [[natural harbour]] made the UK accept the Norwegian claim.<ref>Kyvik (2008): 52</ref> This resulted in diplomatic negotiations between the two countries, and in November 1929, Britain renounced its claim to the island.<ref name=b63 />\n\nThe [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen#The Norvegia expeditions|Second ''Norvegia'' Expedition]] arrived in 1928 with the intent of establishing a manned meteorological radio station, but a suitable location could not be found.<ref name=b63 /> By then both the flagpole and hut from the previous year had been washed away.

In 1978\u201379 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding [[penguins]] on the island, consisting of [[macaroni penguin]]<!--Eudyptes chrysolophus--> and, to a lesser extent, [[chinstrap penguin]]<!--Pygoscelis antarctica--> and [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]<!--Pygoscelis adeliae-->, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989\u201390. Nyr\u00f8ysa is the most important [[bird colony|colony]] for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Lars\u00f8ya. [[Southern fulmar]]<!--Fulmarus glacialoides--> is by far the most common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of [[Cape petrel]]<!--Daption capense-->, [[Antarctic prion]]<!--Pachyptila desolata-->, [[Wilson's storm petrel]]<!--Oceanites oceanicus-->, [[black-bellied storm petrel]]<!--Fregetta tropica-->, [[subantarctic skua]]<!--Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi-->, [[southern giant petrel]]<!--Macronectes giganteus-->, [[snow petrel]]<!--Pagodroma nivea-->, [[slender-billed prion]]<!--Pachyptila belcheri--> and [[Antarctic tern]]<!--Sterna vittata-->. [[Kelp gull]]<!--Larus dominicanus--> is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the [[king penguin]], [[wandering albatross]], [[black-browed albatross]], [[Campbell albatross]], [[Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross]], [[sooty albatross]], [[light-mantled albatross]], [[northern giant petrel]], [[Antarctic petrel]], [[blue petrel]], [[soft-plumaged petrel]], [[Kerguelen petrel]], [[white-headed petrel]], [[fairy prion]], [[white-chinned petrel]], [[great shearwater]], [[common diving petrel]], [[south polar skua]] and [[parasitic jaeger]].<ref name=birdlife />\n\nThe only non-bird [[vertebrate]]s on the island are [[pinniped|seals]], specifically the [[southern elephant seal]] and [[Antarctic fur seal]], which both breed on the island.

In 1978\u201379 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding [[penguins]] on the island, consisting of [[macaroni penguin]]<!--Eudyptes chrysolophus--> and, to a lesser extent, [[chinstrap penguin]]<!--Pygoscelis antarctica--> and [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]<!--Pygoscelis adeliae-->, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989\u201390. Nyr\u00f8ysa is the most important [[bird colony|colony]] for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Lars\u00f8ya. [[Southern fulmar]]<!--Fulmarus glacialoides--> is by far the most common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of [[Cape petrel]]<!--Daption capense-->, [[Antarctic prion]]<!--Pachyptila desolata-->, [[Wilson's storm petrel]]<!--Oceanites oceanicus-->, [[black-bellied storm petrel]]<!--Fregetta tropica-->, [[subantarctic skua]]<!--Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi-->, [[southern giant petrel]]<!--Macronectes giganteus-->, [[snow petrel]]<!--Pagodroma nivea-->, [[slender-billed prion]]<!--Pachyptila belcheri--> and [[Antarctic tern]]<!--Sterna vittata-->. [[Kelp gull]]<!--Larus dominicanus--> is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the [[king penguin]], [[wandering albatross]], [[black-browed albatross]], [[Campbell albatross]], [[Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross]], [[sooty albatross]], [[light-mantled albatross]], [[northern giant petrel]], [[Antarctic petrel]], [[blue petrel]], [[soft-plumaged petrel]], [[Kerguelen petrel]], [[white-headed petrel]], [[fairy prion]], [[white-chinned petrel]], [[great shearwater]], [[common diving petrel]], [[south polar skua]] and [[parasitic jaeger]].<ref name=birdlife />\n\nThe only non-bird [[vertebrate]]s on the island are [[pinniped|seals]], specifically the [[southern elephant seal]] and [[Antarctic fur seal]], which both breed on the island.
