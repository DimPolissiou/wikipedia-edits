It is formed in eastern [[Worcester County, Massachusetts]], by junction of its north and south branches near [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]], and flows generally north-northeast past [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]] to join the Merrimack at [[Nashua, New Hampshire]]. The [[Nashua River Watershed]] occupies a major portion of north-central Massachusetts and a much smaller portion of southern New Hampshire.\n\nThe north branch rises west of [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]] and [[Westminster, Massachusetts|Westminster]]. It flows about {{convert|30|mi}} generally southeast past Fitchburg, and joins the south branch about {{convert|5|mi}} below its issuance from the [[Wachusett Reservoir]].\n\n==History==\nThe Nashua River was heavily used for industry during the colonial period and the early United States. During the late 18th century and early 19th century, the heavy concentration of [[paper mill]]s and the use of dyes near [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]] resulted in pollution that notoriously turned the river various colors downstream from the factories.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, [[Marion Stoddart]] started a campaign to restore the Nashua River and its tributaries. She built coalitions with labor leaders and business leaders, in particular the paper companies who were the worst polluters of the river. With federal help, eight treatment plants were built or upgraded along the river. A broad conservation buffer was created along about half the river and its two main tributaries. By the early-1990s, most of the industry was still located along the river, but many parts of the river were once again safe for swimming.

{"title_page": "General of the Army (United States)", "text_new": "{{short description|Second highest possible rank in the United States Army}}'''General of the Army''' (abbreviated as '''GA''') is a five-star general officer and the second highest possible rank in the United States Army. A General of the Army ranks immediately above a general and is equivalent to a fleet admiral and a General of the Air Force. The General of the Army insignia consisted of five {{convert|3/8|inch|mm}} stars in a pentagonal pattern, with points touching. The insignia was paired with the gold and enameled United States Coat of Arms on service coat shoulder loops. The silver colored five-star metal insignia alone would be worn for use as a collar insignia of grade and on the garrison cap. Soft shoulder epaulettes with five {{convert|7/16|inch|mm}} stars in silver thread and gold-threaded United States Coat of Arms on green cloth were worn with shirts and sweaters.\n\nThe rank of \"General of the Army\" has had two incarnations. The rank was introduced in 1866, the year after the American Civil War. It was reserved for the Commanding General of the United States Army, was a four-star rank, and was held by three different individuals from 1866 to 1888. The rank was revived as the modern five-star rank during World War II, and may be awarded to more than one serving officer at a time. It was held by five different individuals from 1944 to 1981. A special rank of General of the Armies, which ranks above General of the Army, exists but has been conferred only twice, to World War I's John J. Pershing, and posthumously to George Washington, by proclamation 177 years after his death.\n\n==History==\n\n===Post\u2013American Civil War era===\nOn 25 July 1866, the U.S. Congress established the rank of \"General of the Army of the United States\" for General Ulysses S. Grant. His pay was \"four hundred dollars per month, and his allowance for fuel and quarters\", except \"when his headquarters are in Washington, shall be at the rate of three hundred dollars per month.\" (His combined monthly pay and allowance of seven hundred dollars in 1866 is {{Inflation|US|700|1866|fmt=eq|r=-3}}). When appointed General of the Army, Grant wore the rank insignia of four stars and coat buttons arranged in three groups of four.\n\nUnlike the World War II rank with a similar title, the 1866 rank of General of the Army was a four-star rank. This rank held all the authority and power of a 1799 proposal for a rank of \"General of the Armies\", even though Grant was never called by this title.\n\nIn contrast to the modern four-star rank of general, only one officer at a time could hold the 1866\u20131888 rank of General of the Army. For a few months in 1885, as he was dying, Grant was accorded a special honor and his rank was restored by Congressional legislation.\n\nAfter Grant became U.S. president, he was succeeded as General of the Army by William T. Sherman, effective 4 March 1869. In 1872, Sherman ordered the insignia changed to two stars, with the coat of arms of the United States in between.\n\nBy an Act of Congress on 1 June 1888, the grade was conferred upon Philip Sheridan, who by then was in failing health. The rank of General of the Army ceased to exist with Sheridan's death on 5 August 1888.\n\n====Generals of the Army====\n===World War II and Korean War era===\nAs the logistics and military leadership requirements of World War II escalated after the June 1944 Normandy Landings, the United States government created a new version of General of the Army.  The five-star rank and authority of General of the Army and equivalent naval Fleet Admiral was created by an Act of Congress on a temporary basis when  was passed on 14 December 1944,<ref>{{cite web\n | url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Public_Law_78-482\n | title= Public Law 482\n | accessdate= 2008-04-29\n}}</ref> which provided only 75% of pay and allowances to the grade for those on the retired list.<ref name=PL78-482 /> The rank was temporary, subject to reversion to permanent rank six months after the end of the war. The temporary rank was then declared permanent on 23 March 1946 by , which also awarded full pay and allowances in the grade to those on the retired list. It was created to give the most senior American commanders parity of rank with their British counterparts holding the ranks of field marshal and admiral of the fleet. This second General of the Army rank is not the same as the post-Civil War era version because of its purpose and five stars.\n\nThe insignia for the 1944 General of the Army rank consists of five stars in a pentagonal pattern, with points touching.  The five officers who have held the 1944 version of General of the Army and the date of each's appointment are as follows:\n\n====Generals of the Army====\nThe timing of the first four of these appointments was coordinated with the following appointments of the U.S. Navy's first three five-star Fleet Admirals: \n\nThis was to establish both an order of seniority among the generals and a near-equivalence between the services.\n\nAlthough briefly considered, the U.S. Army did not introduce a rank of Field Marshal. In the United States, the term \"Marshal\" has traditionally been used for civilian law enforcement officers, particularly the U.S. Marshals, as well as formerly for state and local police chiefs. In addition, giving the rank the name \"marshal\" would have resulted in George Marshall being designated as \"Field Marshal Marshall\", which was considered undignified.\n\nEisenhower resigned his army commission on 31 May 1952 to run for the U.S. presidency. After Eisenhower was elected and served two terms, President John F. Kennedy on 22 March 1961 signed , which authorized reappointing Eisenhower \"to the active list of the Regular Army in his former grade, of General of the Army with his former date of rank in such grade\". This rank is today commemorated on the signs denoting Interstate Highways as part of the Eisenhower Interstate System, which display five silver stars on a light blue background.\n\nArnold, a general in the Army, was the Commanding General of the Army Air Forces when he was promoted to the rank of General of the Army. After the United States Air Force became a separate service on 18 September 1947, Arnold's rank was carried over to the Air Force, just as all Army Air Forces airmen's rank carried over. Arnold was the first and, to date, only General of the Air Force. He is also the only person to have ever held a five-star rank in two branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nThese officers who held the rank of General of the Army remained officers of the United States Army for life, with an annual $20,000 in pay and allowances, . They were entitled to an office maintained by the Army along with an aide (of the rank of colonel), a secretary, and an orderly.\n\n===Modern usage===\nNo officers have been appointed to the rank of General of the Army since Omar Bradley. The rank of General of the Army is still maintained as a rank of the U.S. Army, and could again be bestowed, pending approval of the United States Senate. However, the President, with consent from the Senate, may award a fifth star at any time he sees fit.\n\nAlthough the first Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Omar Bradley, was eventually awarded a fifth star, such a promotion does not come with that office; Bradley's elevation was a political move so that he would not be outranked by his subordinate, Douglas MacArthur.\n\nIn the 1990s, there were proposals in Department of Defense academic circles to bestow a five-star rank on the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Persian Gulf War, but before his tenure as Secretary of State, there was talk of awarding a fifth star to General Colin Powell, who had served as CJCS during the conflict. But even in the face of public and Congressional pressure to do so, Clinton presidential transition team staffers decided against it for political reasons, fearing that a fifth star may have assisted Powell had he decided to run for office. An effort was also made to promote General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. to General of the Army, although it was not carried out.\n\nAs recently as the late 2000s, some commentators proposed that the military leader in the Global War on Terrorism be promoted to a five-star rank. In January 2011, the founders of the Vets for Freedom political advocacy group published an op-ed in the ''Wall Street Journal'' calling for David Petraeus to be  awarded a fifth star in recognition of his work and the importance of his mission. Earlier, in July 2010, D.B. Grady wrote an article in ''The Atlantic'' supporting the same promotion.\n\n==Ranks senior to General of the Army==\n{{Main|General of the Armies}}\n\nThe rank of General of the Armies is senior to General of the Army, and this rank has been bestowed on only two officers in U.S. history. In 1919, [[John J. Pershing]] was promoted to General of the Armies for his services in [[World War I]]. In 1976,<!----don't change this to 1796, the 1976 date is correct----> [[George Washington]] was posthumously promoted to this rank for his service as the first commanding general of the United States Army.<ref name=\"Amil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/5star.html|title=U.S. Army Five Star Generals \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions|website=history.army.mil|publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History|access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=Pub94-479 /> In 1903, retroactive to 1899, [[George Dewey]] was promoted to [[Admiral of the Navy (United States)|Admiral of the Navy]], a rank equivalent to General of the Armies.\n\nWhen the five-star rank of General of the Army was introduced, it was decided that General Pershing, who was still living, would be superior in rank to all the newly appointed Generals of the Army. Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]] was asked whether Pershing was therefore a five-star general (at that time the highest rank was a four-star general).

When appointed General of the Army, Grant wore the rank insignia of four stars and coat buttons arranged in three groups of four.\n\nUnlike the [[World War II]] rank with a similar title, the 1866 rank of General of the Army was a four-star rank. This rank held all the authority and power of a 1799 proposal for a rank of \"[[General of the Armies]]\", even though Grant was never called by this title.\n\nIn contrast to the modern four-star rank of [[General (United States)|general]], only one officer at a time could hold the 1866\u20131888 rank of General of the Army. For a few months in 1885, as he was dying, Grant was accorded a special honor and his rank was restored by Congressional legislation.\n\nAfter Grant became U.S. president, he was succeeded as General of the Army by [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T.

In 1872, Sherman ordered the insignia changed to two stars, with the [[Great Seal of the United States|coat of arms of the United States]] in between.<ref name=Amil />\n\nBy an Act of Congress on 1 June 1888, the grade was conferred upon [[Philip Sheridan]], who by then was in failing health.

Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]] was asked whether Pershing was therefore a five-star general (at that time the highest rank was a four-star general). Stimson stated:\n\n{{Bquote|It appears the intent of the Army was to make the General of the Armies senior in grade to the General of the Army.

According to [[S:Public Law 94-479|Public Law 94-479]], ''General of the Armies of the United States'' is established as having \"rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present\", clearly making it superior in grade to ''General of the Army''.<ref name=Pub94-479>{{cite web |title=Public Law 94-479 |url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg2078.pdf |website=gpo.gov |publisher=United States Government Printing Office|access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref> Thus, Washington will always be the most senior general of the United States.

Many other statistical tests also use this distribution, such as [[Friedman test|Friedman's analysis of variance by ranks]].\n\n==Definitions==\nIf ''Z''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''Z''<sub>''k''</sub> are [[independence (probability theory)|independent]], [[standard normal]] random variables, then the sum of their squares,\n: <math>\n    Q\\ = \\sum_{i=1}^k Z_i^2 ,\n  </math>\nis distributed according to the chi-square distribution with ''k'' degrees of freedom. This is usually denoted as\n: <math>\n    Q\\ \\sim\\ \\chi^2(k)\\ \\ \\text{or}\\ \\ Q\\ \\sim\\ \\chi^2_k .\n  </math>\n\nThe chi-square distribution has one parameter: a positive integer ''k'' that specifies the number of [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] (the number of ''Z''<sub>''i''</sub> s).\n\n===Introduction===\n\nThe chi-square distribution is used primarily in hypothesis testing, and to a lesser extent for confidence intervals for population variance when the underlying distribution is normal. Unlike more widely known distributions such as the [[normal distribution]] and the [[exponential distribution]], the chi-square distribution is not as often applied in the direct modeling of natural phenomena. It arises in the following hypothesis tests, among others:\n\n*[[Pearson's chi-square test|Chi-square test]] of independence in [[contingency tables]]\n*[[Pearson's chi-square test|Chi-square test]] of goodness of fit of observed data to hypothetical distributions\n*[[Likelihood-ratio test]] for nested models\n*[[Log-rank test]] in survival analysis\n*[[Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel statistics|Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel test]] for stratified contingency tables\n\nIt is also a component of the definition of the [[Student's t-distribution|t-distribution]] and the [[F-distribution]] used in t-tests, analysis of variance, and regression analysis.\n\nThe primary reason that the chi-square distribution is used extensively in hypothesis testing is its relationship to the normal distribution. Many hypothesis tests use a test statistic, such as the [[t-statistic]] in a t-test. For these hypothesis tests, as the sample size, n, increases, the [[sampling distribution]] of the test statistic approaches the normal distribution ([[central limit theorem]]). Because the test statistic (such as t) is asymptotically normally distributed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large, the distribution used for hypothesis testing may be approximated by a normal distribution. Testing hypotheses using a normal distribution is well understood and relatively easy. The simplest chi-square distribution is the square of a standard normal distribution. So wherever a normal distribution could be used for a hypothesis test, a chi-square distribution could be used.\n\nSuppose that <math>Z</math> is a random variable sampled from the standard normal distribution, where the mean equals to <math>0</math> and the variance equals to <math>1</math>: <math>Z \\sim N(0,1)</math>. Now, consider the random variable <math>Q = Z^2</math>. The distribution of the random variable <math>Q</math> is an example of a chi-square distribution: <math>\n     \\ Q\\ \\sim\\ \\chi^2_1 .\n  </math> The subscript 1 indicates that this particular chi-square distribution is constructed from only 1 standard normal distribution. A chi-square distribution constructed by squaring a single standard normal distribution is said to have 1 degree of freedom. Thus, as the sample size for a hypothesis test increases, the distribution of the test statistic approaches a normal distribution. Just as extreme values of the normal distribution have low probability (and give small p-values), extreme values of the chi-square distribution have low probability.\n\nAn additional reason that the chi-square distribution is widely used is that it turns up as the large sample distribution of generalized [[Likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio tests]] (LRT).<ref name=Westfall2013>{{cite book|last1=Westfall|first1=Peter H.|title=Understanding Advanced Statistical Methods|date=2013|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4665-1210-8}}</ref> LRT's have several desirable properties; in particular, simple LRT's commonly provide the highest power to reject the null hypothesis ([[Neyman\u2013Pearson lemma]]) and this leads also to optimality properties of generalised LRTs. However, the normal and chi-square approximations are only valid asymptotically. For this reason, it is preferable to use the t distribution rather than the normal approximation or the chi-square approximation for a small sample size. Similarly, in analyses of contingency tables, the chi-square approximation will be poor for a small sample size, and it is preferable to use [[Fisher's exact test]]. Ramsey shows that the exact [[binomial test]] is always more powerful than the normal approximation.<ref name=Ramsey1988>{{cite journal|last1=Ramsey|first1=PH|title=Evaluating the Normal Approximation to the Binomial Test|journal=Journal of Educational Statistics|date=1988|volume=13|issue=2|pages=173\u201382|doi=10.2307/1164752|jstor=1164752}}</ref>\n\nLancaster shows the connections among the binomial, normal, and chi-square distributions, as follows.<ref name=\"Lancaster1969\">{{Citation\n|last=Lancaster\n|first=H.O.\n|title=The Chi-squared Distribution\n|year=1969\n|publisher=Wiley\n}}</ref> De Moivre and Laplace established that a binomial distribution could be approximated by a normal distribution. Specifically they showed the asymptotic normality of the random variable\n\n:<math> \\chi = {m - Np \\over \\sqrt{Npq}} </math>\n\nwhere <math>m</math> is the observed number of successes in <math>N</math> trials, where the probability of success is <math>p</math>, and <math>q = 1 - p</math>.\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives\n\n:<math> \\chi^2 = {(m - Np)^2\\over Npq} </math>\n\nUsing <math>N = Np + N(1 - p)</math>, <math>N = m + (N - m)</math>, and <math>q = 1 - p</math>, this equation simplifies to\n\n:<math> \\chi^2 = {(m - Np)^2\\over Np} + {(N - m - Nq)^2\\over Nq} </math>\n\nThe expression on the right is of the form that [[Karl Pearson]] would generalize to the form:\n\n:<math> \\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}  </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> \\chi^2</math> = Pearson's cumulative test statistic, which asymptotically approaches a <math>\\chi^2</math> distribution.\n:<math>O_i</math> = the number of observations of type <math>i</math>.\n:<math>E_i = N p_i</math> = the expected (theoretical) frequency of type <math>i</math>, asserted by the null hypothesis that the fraction of type <math>i</math> in the population is <math> p_i</math>\n:<math>n</math>  = the number of cells in the table.\n\nIn the case of a binomial outcome (flipping a coin), the binomial distribution may be approximated by a normal distribution (for sufficiently large <math>n</math>). Because the square of a standard normal distribution is the chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom, the probability of a result such as 1 heads in 10 trials can be approximated either by using the normal distribution directly, or the chi-square distribution for the normalised, squared difference between observed and expected value. However, many problems involve more than the two possible outcomes of a binomial, and instead require 3 or more categories, which leads to the multinomial distribution. Just as de Moivre and Laplace sought for and found the normal approximation to the binomial, Pearson sought for and found a degenerate multivariate normal approximation to the multinomial distribution (the numbers in each category add up to the total sample size, which is considered fixed).

Many other statistical tests also use this distribution, such as [[Friedman test|Friedman's analysis of variance by ranks]].\n\n==Definitions==\nIf ''Z''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''Z''<sub>''k''</sub> are [[independence (probability theory)|independent]], [[standard normal]] random variables, then the sum of their squares,\n: <math>\n    Q\\ = \\sum_{i=1}^k Z_i^2 ,\n  </math>\nis distributed according to the chi-square distribution with ''k'' degrees of freedom. This is usually denoted as\n: <math>\n    Q\\ \\sim\\ \\chi^2(k)\\ \\ \\text{or}\\ \\ Q\\ \\sim\\ \\chi^2_k .\n  </math>\n\nThe chi-square distribution has one parameter: a positive integer ''k'' that specifies the number of [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] (the number of ''Z''<sub>''i''</sub> s).\n\n===Introduction===\n\nThe chi-square distribution is used primarily in hypothesis testing, and to a lesser extent for confidence intervals for population variance when the underlying distribution is normal. Unlike more widely known distributions such as the [[normal distribution]] and the [[exponential distribution]], the chi-square distribution is not as often applied in the direct modeling of natural phenomena. It arises in the following hypothesis tests, among others:\n\n*[[Pearson's chi-square test|Chi-square test]] of independence in [[contingency tables]]\n*[[Pearson's chi-square test|Chi-square test]] of goodness of fit of observed data to hypothetical distributions\n*[[Likelihood-ratio test]] for nested models\n*[[Log-rank test]] in survival analysis\n*[[Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel statistics|Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel test]] for stratified contingency tables\n\nIt is also a component of the definition of the [[Student's t-distribution|t-distribution]] and the [[F-distribution]] used in t-tests, analysis of variance, and regression analysis.\n\nThe primary reason that the chi-square distribution is used extensively in hypothesis testing is its relationship to the normal distribution. Many hypothesis tests use a test statistic, such as the [[t-statistic]] in a t-test. For these hypothesis tests, as the sample size, n, increases, the [[sampling distribution]] of the test statistic approaches the normal distribution ([[central limit theorem]]). Because the test statistic (such as t) is asymptotically normally distributed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large, the distribution used for hypothesis testing may be approximated by a normal distribution. Testing hypotheses using a normal distribution is well understood and relatively easy. The simplest chi-square distribution is the square of a standard normal distribution. So wherever a normal distribution could be used for a hypothesis test, a chi-square distribution could be used.\n\nSuppose that <math>Z</math> is a random variable sampled from the standard normal distribution, where the mean equals to <math>0</math> and the variance equals to <math>1</math>: <math>Z \\sim N(0,1)</math>. Now, consider the random variable <math>Q = Z^2</math>. The distribution of the random variable <math>Q</math> is an example of a chi-square distribution: <math>\n     \\ Q\\ \\sim\\ \\chi^2_1 .\n  </math> The subscript 1 indicates that this particular chi-square distribution is constructed from only 1 standard normal distribution. A chi-square distribution constructed by squaring a single standard normal distribution is said to have 1 degree of freedom. Thus, as the sample size for a hypothesis test increases, the distribution of the test statistic approaches a normal distribution. Just as extreme values of the normal distribution have low probability (and give small p-values), extreme values of the chi-square distribution have low probability.\n\nAn additional reason that the chi-square distribution is widely used is that it turns up as the large sample distribution of generalized [[Likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio tests]] (LRT).<ref name=Westfall2013>{{cite book|last1=Westfall|first1=Peter H.|title=Understanding Advanced Statistical Methods|date=2013|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4665-1210-8}}</ref> LRT's have several desirable properties; in particular, simple LRT's commonly provide the highest power to reject the null hypothesis ([[Neyman\u2013Pearson lemma]]) and this leads also to optimality properties of generalised LRTs. However, the normal and chi-square approximations are only valid asymptotically. For this reason, it is preferable to use the t distribution rather than the normal approximation or the chi-square approximation for a small sample size. Similarly, in analyses of contingency tables, the chi-square approximation will be poor for a small sample size, and it is preferable to use [[Fisher's exact test]]. Ramsey shows that the exact [[binomial test]] is always more powerful than the normal approximation.<ref name=Ramsey1988>{{cite journal|last1=Ramsey|first1=PH|title=Evaluating the Normal Approximation to the Binomial Test|journal=Journal of Educational Statistics|date=1988|volume=13|issue=2|pages=173\u201382|doi=10.2307/1164752|jstor=1164752}}</ref>\n\nLancaster shows the connections among the binomial, normal, and chi-square distributions, as follows.<ref name=\"Lancaster1969\">{{Citation\n|last=Lancaster\n|first=H.O.\n|title=The Chi-squared Distribution\n|year=1969\n|publisher=Wiley\n}}</ref> De Moivre and Laplace established that a binomial distribution could be approximated by a normal distribution. Specifically they showed the asymptotic normality of the random variable\n\n:<math> \\chi = {m - Np \\over \\sqrt{Npq}} </math>\n\nwhere <math>m</math> is the observed number of successes in <math>N</math> trials, where the probability of success is <math>p</math>, and <math>q = 1 - p</math>.\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives\n\n:<math> \\chi^2 = {(m - Np)^2\\over Npq} </math>\n\nUsing <math>N = Np + N(1 - p)</math>, <math>N = m + (N - m)</math>, and <math>q = 1 - p</math>, this equation simplifies to\n\n:<math> \\chi^2 = {(m - Np)^2\\over Np} + {(N - m - Nq)^2\\over Nq} </math>\n\nThe expression on the right is of the form that [[Karl Pearson]] would generalize to the form:\n\n:<math> \\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}  </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> \\chi^2</math> = Pearson's cumulative test statistic, which asymptotically approaches a <math>\\chi^2</math> distribution.\n:<math>O_i</math> = the number of observations of type <math>i</math>.\n:<math>E_i = N p_i</math> = the expected (theoretical) frequency of type <math>i</math>, asserted by the null hypothesis that the fraction of type <math>i</math> in the population is <math> p_i</math>\n:<math>n</math>  = the number of cells in the table.\n\nIn the case of a binomial outcome (flipping a coin), the binomial distribution may be approximated by a normal distribution (for sufficiently large <math>n</math>). Because the square of a standard normal distribution is the chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom, the probability of a result such as 1 heads in 10 trials can be approximated either by using the normal distribution directly, or the chi-square distribution for the normalised, squared difference between observed and expected value. However, many problems involve more than the two possible outcomes of a binomial, and instead require 3 or more categories, which leads to the multinomial distribution. Just as de Moivre and Laplace sought for and found the normal approximation to the binomial, Pearson sought for and found a degenerate multivariate normal approximation to the multinomial distribution (the numbers in each category add up to the total sample size, which is considered fixed).

Thus in German this was traditionally known as the ''Helmert'sche'' (\"Helmertian\") or \"Helmert distribution\".\n\nThe distribution was independently rediscovered by the English mathematician [[Karl Pearson]] in the context of [[goodness of fit]], for which he developed his [[Pearson's chi-square test]], published in 1900, with computed table of values published in {{Harv|Elderton|1902}}, collected in {{Harv|Pearson|1914|pp=xxxi\u2013xxxiii, 26\u201328|loc=Table XII}}.\nThe name \"chi-square\" ultimately derives from Pearson's shorthand for the exponent in a [[multivariate normal distribution]] with the Greek letter [[Chi (letter)|Chi]], writing\n\u2212\u00bd\u03c7<sup>2</sup> for what would appear in modern notation as \u2212\u00bd'''x'''<sup>T</sup>\u03a3<sup>\u22121</sup>'''x''' (\u03a3 being the [[covariance matrix]]).<ref>\nR.

The presidency of [[Jimmy Carter]] led to a right-wing shift in the Democratic Party. From [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to Richard Nixon, there was a bipartisan support for maintaining social liberal programs created as part of FDR's [[New Deal]]. The Carter administration was the first to begin deregulating and neo-liberalizing the United States economic system.\n\nIn 1985, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], a faction within the party, was created after the landslide victory of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ronald Reagan]] over Democrat [[Walter Mondale]] at the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential election]].\n\nDuring the [[1992 United States presidential election]], Bill Clinton and Al Gore, both members of the Democratic Leadership Council, each ran as a [[New Democrats|New Democrat]], running as a Democrat for more limited government. On social issues, Clinton signed the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]]. On LGBT rights, although coming out strongly in 1993 for open military service for LGBT Americans, Clinton settled on the compromise [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy (signed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] into law) and signed [[Executive Order 12968]] and [[Executive Order 13087|13087]].\n\nThe [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries and caucuses]] was largely a three-way fight between [[John Kerry]], member of the [[New Democrat Coalition]], [[John Edwards]] (also a member of the New Democrat Coalition) and [[Howard Dean]], founder of [[Democracy for America]].\n\nMost neoliberal Democrats in Congress are members of the New Democrat Coalition, although the [[Blue Dog Coalition]] does include some [[Democratic Leadership Council]] members. There is considerable overlap in the membership of the New Democrats and Blue Dogs, with most of the Blue Dogs holding simultaneous membership and leadership positions with the New Democrats.\n\n===Conservative wing===\n{{main|Conservative Democrat}}\n{{See also|Democrats for Life of America}}\n{{See also|Blue Dog Coalition}}\n[[File:Senator Manchin.jpg|thumb|150px|[[United States Senator]] [[Joe Manchin]]]]\n\nFrom the 1860s to the 1940s, conservative Democrats came to mean opposition to the Radical Republicans who wanted to grant full citizenship rights to freed slaves and take political power away from the ex-Confederates. In the 1940s, the Democratic Party began to advocate against [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].\n\nThe [[conservative coalition]] was an unofficial coalition in the [[United States Congress]] bringing together a conservative majority of the Republican Party and the conservative, mostly [[Southern Democrats|Southern]] wing of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. It was dominant in Congress from 1937 to 1963 and remained a political force until the mid-1980s, eventually dying out in the 1990s. In terms of Congressional roll call votes, it primarily appeared on votes affecting labor unions. The conservative coalition did not operate on civil rights bills, for the two wings had opposing viewpoints.<ref>Katznelson, 1993</ref> However, the coalition did have the power to prevent unwanted bills from even coming to a vote. The coalition included many committee chairmen from the South who blocked bills by not reporting them from their committees. Furthermore, [[Howard W. Smith]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]], often could kill a bill simply by not reporting it out with a favorable rule and he lost some of that power in 1961.<ref>Bruce J. Dierenfield, ''Keeper of the Rules: Congressman Howard W. Smith of Virginia'' (1987)</ref> The conservative coalition was not concerned with foreign policy as most of the [[Southern Democrats]] were internationalists, a position opposed by most [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].\n\nToday, conservative Democrats are generally regarded as members of the Democratic Party who are more conservative than the national political party as a whole. Today's conservative Democrats vary greatly in ideology. Some are [[fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] yet [[cultural liberalism|socially liberal]], somewhat akin to the now rare [[Moderate Republicans]], whereas others have a more [[communitarian]] ideology{{snd}}that is, socially moderate but in favor of qualified economic intervention {{snd}}reminiscent of [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] in Europe and Latin America. On foreign policy, conservative Democrats are generally [[liberal interventionism|liberal internationalists]]. Conservative Democrats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] are usually members of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], although there is some overlap with the New Democrats. The Blue Dog Coalition prioritizes pragmatic and commonsense solutions to critical issues, \"pursuing fiscal responsibility, ensuring a strong national defense, and transcending party lines to get things done for the American people.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bluedogcaucus-costa.house.gov/ |title=Blue Dog Coalition}}</ref>\n\n===Libertarian wing===\n{{main|Libertarian Democrat}}\n[[File:Mike Gravel.png|thumb|150px|[[United States Senator]] [[Mike Gravel]]]]\n\n[[Civil liberties]] advocates and people against [[National debt of the United States|national debt]] also often support the Democratic Party because its positions on such issues as [[civil rights]] and [[separation of church and state]] are more closely aligned to their own than the positions of the Republican Party and because the Democrats' economic agenda may be more appealing to them than that of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Polis |first=Jared |url=http://reason.com/archives/2014/10/30/vote-democrat-for-real-libertarian-value |title=Vote Democratic for Real Libertarian Values |magazine=Reason Magazine |date=October 30, 2014 |accessdate=June 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCivil libertarians oppose [[gun control]], the \"[[Prohibition (drugs)|War on Drugs]]\", [[protectionism]], [[corporate welfare]], [[Government debt|governmental borrowing]] and an [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy.

From 1900 to 1920, liberals called themselves progressives and rallied behind Democrats such as [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] to fight corruption, waste and big trusts. The Wilson administration saw the enactment of the [[the New Freedom|New Freedom]], progressive social programs enacted from 1913 to 1916, when the Democrats controlled Congress. The rise of the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement saw the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and a push for civil rights legislation on the basis of gender. The first modern self-described liberal Democratic President was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who enacted the [[New Deal]], a series of [[social liberal]] programs enacted in the United States between 1933 and 1938 and a few that came later. From the 1940s onwards, liberal Democrats began pushing for [[desegregation]] and civil rights legislation for racial minorities. Starting in the 1960s, liberal Democrats began pushing for [[immigration reform]] and [[gun control]]. During the [[Cold War]], the liberal Democratic movement became [[anti-communist]].\n\nIn the 1970s, liberal Democrats began pushing for civil rights for disabled people, consumer protection, environmentalism, LGBT rights, reproductive rights and the end to capital punishment. The election of President Jimmy Carter in 1976 marked the end of the bipartisan support from presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt to [[Richard Nixon]] to the New Deal programs and marked the beginning of support among presidents for more [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies. The key legislative achievement of the Obama administration, the passage and enactment of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare), was generally supported among liberal Democrats, but criticized by some for not going far enough. On [[social progressivism]], liberal Democrats achieved expansion of LGBT rights, federal hate crime laws, rescinding the [[Mexico City Policy]], later reinstituted by President [[Donald Trump]], rescinding the ban on federal taxpayer dollars to fund research on [[embryonic stem cells]], [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] and the [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw]]. In the 2010s, Democratic liberals began pushing for the [[legalization of cannabis]], succeeding in several states. President [[Barack Obama]], who opposed cannabis legalization despite being a former smoker himself, did not crack down on states that did legalize cannabis during his presidency.\n\nToday, liberal Democrats are generally regarded as being socially progressive. On economic issues, liberal Democrats vary, with some supporting neoliberal economics while others support [[Keynesian economics]] or a mixed economic system.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} On foreign policy, there is also a divide among liberal Democrats, with some being [[Liberal internationalism|liberal internationalists]] while other are less in favor of interventionism.\n\nThe presidency of Obama was comparatively further to the left than [[Bill Clinton]]'s. In 2011, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], which supported more centrist and [[Third Way]] positions, was dissolved. Obama has opposed tax reform, the [[Keystone XL Pipeline]] and signed Obamacare into law.

The Asian American population had been a stronghold of the Republican Party until the [[United States presidential election]] of 1992 in which [[George H. W. Bush]] won 55% of the Asian American vote, compared to [[Bill Clinton]] winning 31% and [[Ross Perot]] winning 15% of the Asian vote. Originally, the vast majority of Asian Americans consisted of strongly anti-communist, pro-democracy [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese refugees]], Chinese Americans, [[Taiwanese Americans]], [[Korean Americans]] and socially conservative [[Filipino American|Filipinos]] who fled [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in the 1960s through the 1980s. The Republican Party's socially conservative, fervently anti-communist position strongly resonated with this original demographic. The Democratic Party made gains among the Asian American population starting in 1996 and in 2006 won 62% of the Asian American vote. Exit polls after the 2008 presidential election indicated that Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]] had won 62% of the Asian American vote nationwide.<ref>\"[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1209/racial-ethnic-voters-presidential-election?src=prc-latest&proj=peoplepress Dissecting the 2008 Electorate: Most Diverse in U.S. History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618075224/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1209/racial-ethnic-voters-presidential-election?src=prc-latest&proj=peoplepress |date=2012-06-18 }}\".

In 1971, the [[Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club|Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club of San Francisco]] was formed as the first registered [[political action committee]] for LGBT Democrats in the nation. The [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] saw the first speaking slots for LGBT people at a Democratic National Convention, along with votes and rejecting LGBT rights plank to the Democratic Party platform. The presidency of [[Jimmy Carter]] was the first to address LGBT rights, but he did very little to address LGBT rights as President. In the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], in response to Carter not doing enough for LGBT rights and not supporting an LGBT plank in the Democratic Party, [[Ted Kennedy]] courted to LGBT voters, supporting adding an LGBT plank to the Democratic Party. LGBT voters voted for Kennedy during the primary, helping him win the California primary and lead to the first LGBT plank to the Democratic Party. During the [[1988 United States presidential election]], [[Michael Dukakis]] was overtly homophobic, leading to many LGBT voters to boo him during a meeting Dukakis had with LGBT groups. Polling showed that [[George H. W. Bush]] won 35\u201340% of the LGBT vote during the 1988 presidential election.\n\nBoth presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] heavily targeted LGBT voters. Exit polling going back to 1990 to the present show that LGBT voters overwhelming prefer the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. On average, about 72.5% of LGBT voters voted Democratic in exit polling for the presidential elections dating from 1992 to the present. On average, about 74.42% of LGBT voters voted Democratic in exit polling for House of Representatives elections dating from 1990 to the present. In the 2012 election exit polls, Obama won 76% of LGBT voters. In the 2016 election polls, [[Hillary Clinton]] won 78% of LGBT voters.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|+style=\"font-size:100%\"|National polling of the 2008 Democratic presidential

The 2008 national Democratic Party platform for the first time included \"gender identity\" in the party platform, the first explicit inclusion of transgender people in the national Democratic Party platform.

In 2010, President Obama became the first president to appoint an openly transgender person to political positions in the United States federal government.

The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work. It consists mainly of [[Clerk (position)#United States|clerical]] and [[blue-collar worker]]s.<ref name=\"The American Class Structure\"/> Even though most in the working class are able to afford an adequate [[standard of living]], high economic insecurity and possible personal benefit from an extended [[social safety net]] make the majority of working-class people left-of-center on economic issues. However, most working class Democrats differ from most liberals in their more socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. White working class Democrats are more in favor of gun rights and oppose affirmative action programs while non-white working class Democrats are more in favor of gun control measures and support affirmative action programs. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively.

The presidency of [[Jimmy Carter]] led to a right-wing shift in the Democratic Party. From [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to Richard Nixon, there was a bipartisan support for maintaining social liberal programs created as part of FDR's [[New Deal]]. The Carter administration was the first to begin deregulating and neo-liberalizing the United States economic system.\n\nIn 1985, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], a faction within the party, was created after the landslide victory of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ronald Reagan]] over Democrat [[Walter Mondale]] at the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential election]].\n\nDuring the [[1992 United States presidential election]], Bill Clinton and Al Gore, both members of the Democratic Leadership Council, each ran as a [[New Democrats|New Democrat]], running as a Democrat for more limited government. On social issues, Clinton signed the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]]. On LGBT rights, although coming out strongly in 1993 for open military service for LGBT Americans, Clinton settled on the compromise [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy (signed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] into law) and signed [[Executive Order 12968]] and [[Executive Order 13087|13087]].\n\nThe [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries and caucuses]] was largely a three-way fight between [[John Kerry]], member of the [[New Democrat Coalition]], [[John Edwards]] (also a member of the New Democrat Coalition) and [[Howard Dean]], founder of [[Democracy for America]].\n\nMost neoliberal Democrats in Congress are members of the New Democrat Coalition, although the [[Blue Dog Coalition]] does include some [[Democratic Leadership Council]] members. There is considerable overlap in the membership of the New Democrats and Blue Dogs, with most of the Blue Dogs holding simultaneous membership and leadership positions with the New Democrats.\n\n===Conservative wing===\n{{main|Conservative Democrat}}\n{{See also|Democrats for Life of America}}\n{{See also|Blue Dog Coalition}}\n[[File:Senator Manchin.jpg|thumb|150px|[[United States Senator]] [[Joe Manchin]]]]\n\nFrom the 1860s to the 1940s, conservative Democrats came to mean opposition to the Radical Republicans who wanted to grant full citizenship rights to freed slaves and take political power away from the ex-Confederates. In the 1940s, the Democratic Party began to advocate against [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].\n\nThe [[conservative coalition]] was an unofficial coalition in the [[United States Congress]] bringing together a conservative majority of the Republican Party and the conservative, mostly [[Southern Democrats|Southern]] wing of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. It was dominant in Congress from 1937 to 1963 and remained a political force until the mid-1980s, eventually dying out in the 1990s. In terms of Congressional roll call votes, it primarily appeared on votes affecting labor unions. The conservative coalition did not operate on civil rights bills, for the two wings had opposing viewpoints.<ref>Katznelson, 1993</ref> However, the coalition did have the power to prevent unwanted bills from even coming to a vote. The coalition included many committee chairmen from the South who blocked bills by not reporting them from their committees. Furthermore, [[Howard W. Smith]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]], often could kill a bill simply by not reporting it out with a favorable rule and he lost some of that power in 1961.<ref>Bruce J. Dierenfield, ''Keeper of the Rules: Congressman Howard W. Smith of Virginia'' (1987)</ref> The conservative coalition was not concerned with foreign policy as most of the [[Southern Democrats]] were internationalists, a position opposed by most [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].\n\nToday, conservative Democrats are generally regarded as members of the Democratic Party who are more conservative than the national political party as a whole. Today's conservative Democrats vary greatly in ideology. Some are [[fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] yet [[cultural liberalism|socially liberal]], somewhat akin to the now rare [[Moderate Republicans]], whereas others have a more [[communitarian]] ideology{{snd}}that is, socially moderate but in favor of qualified economic intervention {{snd}}reminiscent of [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] in Europe and Latin America. On foreign policy, conservative Democrats are generally [[liberal interventionism|liberal internationalists]].

From 1900 to 1920, liberals called themselves progressives and rallied behind Democrats such as [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] to fight corruption, waste and big trusts. The Wilson administration saw the enactment of the [[the New Freedom|New Freedom]], progressive social programs enacted from 1913 to 1916, when the Democrats controlled Congress. The rise of the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement saw the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and a push for civil rights legislation on the basis of gender. The first modern self-described liberal Democratic President was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who enacted the [[New Deal]], a series of [[social liberal]] programs enacted in the United States between 1933 and 1938 and a few that came later. From the 1940s onwards, liberal Democrats began pushing for [[desegregation]] and civil rights legislation for racial minorities. Starting in the 1960s, liberal Democrats began pushing for [[immigration reform]] and [[gun control]]. During the [[Cold War]], the liberal Democratic movement became [[anti-communist]].\n\nIn the 1970s, liberal Democrats began pushing for civil rights for disabled people, consumer protection, environmentalism, LGBT rights, reproductive rights and the end to capital punishment. The election of President Jimmy Carter in 1976 marked the end of the bipartisan support from presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt to [[Richard Nixon]] to the New Deal programs and marked the beginning of support among presidents for more [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies. The key legislative achievement of the Obama administration, the passage and enactment of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare), was generally supported among liberal Democrats, but criticized by some for not going far enough. On [[social progressivism]], liberal Democrats achieved expansion of LGBT rights, federal hate crime laws, rescinding the [[Mexico City Policy]], later reinstituted by President [[Donald Trump]], rescinding the ban on federal taxpayer dollars to fund research on [[embryonic stem cells]], [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] and the [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw]]. In the 2010s, Democratic liberals began pushing for the [[legalization of cannabis]], succeeding in several states. President [[Barack Obama]], who opposed cannabis legalization despite being a former smoker himself, did not crack down on states that did legalize cannabis during his presidency.\n\nToday, liberal Democrats are generally regarded as being socially progressive. On economic issues, liberal Democrats vary, with some supporting neoliberal economics while others support [[Keynesian economics]] or a mixed economic system.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} On foreign policy, there is also a divide among liberal Democrats, with some being [[Liberal internationalism|liberal internationalists]] while other are less in favor of interventionism.\n\nThe presidency of Obama was comparatively further to the left than [[Bill Clinton]]'s. In 2011, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], which supported more centrist and [[Third Way]] positions, was dissolved. Obama has opposed tax reform, the [[Keystone XL Pipeline]] and signed Obamacare into law. The candidacy of Hillary Clinton in 2016 continued this trend, as Secretary Clinton eschewed her husband's \"New Covenant\" centrism and fiscal moderation for liberal policies such as rolling back mandatory minimum sentencing laws, a debt-free college tuition plan for public university students and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/07/26/bill-clinton-democratic-convention/87542864/|title=Party of Clinton looks different than in 1992|first=Heidi|last=Przybyla|newspaper=USA Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/|title=Hillary Clinton Was Liberal.

The Asian American population had been a stronghold of the Republican Party until the [[United States presidential election]] of 1992 in which [[George H. W. Bush]] won 55% of the Asian American vote, compared to [[Bill Clinton]] winning 31% and [[Ross Perot]] winning 15% of the Asian vote. Originally, the vast majority of Asian Americans consisted of strongly anti-communist, pro-democracy [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese refugees]], Chinese Americans, [[Taiwanese Americans]], [[Korean Americans]] and socially conservative [[Filipino American|Filipinos]] who fled [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in the 1960s through the 1980s. The Republican Party's socially conservative, fervently anti-communist position strongly resonated with this original demographic. The Democratic Party made gains among the Asian American population starting in 1996 and in 2006 won 62% of the Asian American vote. Exit polls after the 2008 presidential election indicated that Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]] had won 62% of the Asian American vote nationwide.<ref>\"[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1209/racial-ethnic-voters-presidential-election?src=prc-latest&proj=peoplepress Dissecting the 2008 Electorate: Most Diverse in U.S. History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618075224/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1209/racial-ethnic-voters-presidential-election?src=prc-latest&proj=peoplepress |date=2012-06-18 }}\".

This saw a massive decline in the power of organized labor within the Democratic Party.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|+style=\"font-size:100%\"|National exit polling among union members\n|-\n!Year\n!Branch\n!colspan=\"2\"|% of Democratic vote among union members\n|-\n|[[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]<ref name=\"cnn200exitpollpresident\">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/results/index.epolls.html|title=CNN.com \u2013 Election 2000 \u2013 Results|date=September 12, 2001|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010912213226/http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/results/index.epolls.html|archivedate=September 12, 2001}}</ref>\n|[[United States Presidency]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|62||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|[[United States House of Representatives elections, 2004|2004]]<ref name=\"cnn2004houseexitpoll\"/>\n|[[United States House of Representatives]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|65||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|[[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]<ref name=\"2004presidencyexit\"/>\n|[[United States Presidency]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|61||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|[[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006|2006]]<ref name=\"cnn2006houseexitpoll\"/>\n|[[United States House of Representatives]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|68||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|[[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008|2008]]<ref name=\"2008houseexitcnn3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=USH00p3|title=Local Exit Polls - Election Center 2008 - Elections & Politics from CNN.com}}</ref>\n|[[United States House of Representatives]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|65||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|[[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]<ref name=\"3President National Exit Poll2008\"/>\n|[[United States Presidency]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|60||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|}\n\n===LGBT Americans===\n{{see also|Stonewall Democrats}}\n{|\n|[[File:LGBT equality caucus in the 116th Congress.svg|thumb|upright=2|[[Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus]] in the [[116th United States Congress]]]]\n|[[File:Mark Pocan official photo.jpg|thumb|150px|[[United States Representative]] [[Mark Pocan]]]]\n|[[File:Tammy_Baldwin,_official_portrait,_113th_Congress.jpg|thumb|150px|[[United States Senator]] [[Tammy Baldwin]]]]\n|}\n\nSince the 1970s, [[LGBT Americans]] have become a key core consistency within the Democratic Party. In 1971, the [[Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club|Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club of San Francisco]] was formed as the first registered [[political action committee]] for LGBT Democrats in the nation. The [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] saw the first speaking slots for LGBT people at a Democratic National Convention, along with votes and rejecting LGBT rights plank to the Democratic Party platform. The presidency of [[Jimmy Carter]] was the first to address LGBT rights, but he did very little to address LGBT rights as President. In the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], in response to Carter not doing enough for LGBT rights and not supporting an LGBT plank in the Democratic Party, [[Ted Kennedy]] courted to LGBT voters, supporting adding an LGBT plank to the Democratic Party. LGBT voters voted for Kennedy during the primary, helping him win the California primary and lead to the first LGBT plank to the Democratic Party. During the [[1988 United States presidential election]], [[Michael Dukakis]] was overtly homophobic, leading to many LGBT voters to boo him during a meeting Dukakis had with LGBT groups. Polling showed that [[George H. W. Bush]] won 35\u201340% of the LGBT vote during the 1988 presidential election.\n\nBoth presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] heavily targeted LGBT voters. Exit polling going back to 1990 to the present show that LGBT voters overwhelming prefer the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. On average, about 72.5% of LGBT voters voted Democratic in exit polling for the presidential elections dating from 1992 to the present. On average, about 74.42% of LGBT voters voted Democratic in exit polling for House of Representatives elections dating from 1990 to the present. In the 2012 election exit polls, Obama won 76% of LGBT voters. In the 2016 election polls, [[Hillary Clinton]] won 78% of LGBT voters.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|+style=\"font-size:100%\"|National polling of the 2008 Democratic presidential

The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work. It consists mainly of [[Clerk (position)#United States|clerical]] and [[blue-collar worker]]s.<ref name=\"The American Class Structure\"/> Even though most in the working class are able to afford an adequate [[standard of living]], high economic insecurity and possible personal benefit from an extended [[social safety net]] make the majority of working-class people left-of-center on economic issues. However, most working class Democrats differ from most liberals in their more socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. White working class Democrats are more in favor of gun rights and oppose affirmative action programs while non-white working class Democrats are more in favor of gun control measures and support affirmative action programs. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively.

Furthermore, in the midst of the [[Manila Galleon]] trade, a small number of Latinos settled in the ports of Macau in China and [[Ternate]] in Indonesia which were secondary connecting trade nodes to the primary trade-route between [[Manila, Philippines]] and [[Acapulco, Mexico]]; they intermarried with the Portuguese settlers and various Asian settlers; the first Latin Americans Asians were mostly [[Mexicans]] and to a lesser extent, [[Colombians]] and [[Peruvians]] who made their way to Asia (Mainly the Philippines) in the 16th century, the Latin-Americans who were sent to the Philippines and Macau from the Spanish colonies in America were often made up of [[Mulattoes]], [[Mestizos]] and Indios ([[Amerindians]]).<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16086/16086-h/16086-h.htm Letter from Fajardo to Felipe III From Manila, August 15 1620.(From the Spanish Archives of the Indies)]</ref>\n\n[[File:Macanese senhora.jpg|thumb|Macanese ''senhora'' in her traditional attire, the d\u00f3, early 20th century]]\nDuring the late-nineteenth century, and increasingly during [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]'s fascist [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, the upbringing of most Macanese fell along the lines of the continental Portuguese \u2013 attending Portuguese schools, participating in mandatory military service (some fought in Africa) and practising the [[Catholic]] faith. As recently as the 1980s, most Macanese had not received formal Chinese schooling and, hence, could speak but not read or write Chinese.  Spoken [[Cantonese]] was largely familiar, and some spoke the language with a regional accent (\u9109\u4e0b\u8a71) \u2013 acquired largely from their mothers or amahs.<ref>Of interest is the role that the amah plays in Macanese society. It is well known that local Cantonese women were often hired by the Catholic Church in Macau to act as wet-nurses for orphans in the Church's charge. These women were also hired by Macanese families to clean their houses, cook meals and care for their children. It is in these early encounters that Macanese children are first introduced to the Cantonese language and culture. Families are known to keep long-standing friendships with their amahs and in the past, young brides would sometimes bring them along with them to their new home. Nowadays Filipinas fill the role. c.f.

A large number of Macanese can trace their roots to these New Christians. Many of these Chinese were assimilated into the Macanese community, dropping their Chinese surnames and adopting Portuguese surnames.  In the collective Macanese folk memory, there is a little ditty about the parish of St. Lazarus Parish, called \u9032\u6559\u570d, where these Chinese converts lived: \u9032\u6559\u570d, \u5272\u8fae\u4ed4, \u5514\u4fc2\u59d3\u5ff5\u73e0 (Ros\u00e1rio)\u3000\u5c31\u4fc2\u59d3\u73ab\u7470 (Rosa). Hence, it is surmised that many Macanese with surnames of [[Rosario (surname)|Rosario]] or [[Rosa (surname)|Rosa]] probably were of Chinese ancestry.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  Because of this, there are many Eurasians carrying Portuguese surnames Rosario, Rosa, and others that are not Portuguese-blooded may be mistaken by others as Portuguese-blooded, and Eurasians of Portuguese blood carrying Portuguese surnames trace their Portuguese blood on maternal side.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} A visit to the St Michael the Archangel Cemetery (Cemit\u00e9rio S\u00e3o Miguel Arcanjo), the main Catholic cemetery near the St. Lazarus Parish, would reveal gravestones with a whole spectrum of Chinese and Portuguese heritage: Chinese with Portuguese baptised names with or without Portuguese surnames, Portuguese married with Chinese Catholics, and so on.\n\nThe mid-twentieth century, with the outbreak of the Second World War in the Pacific and the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, saw the Macanese population surge through the re-integration of two disparate Macanese communities: the Hong Kong Macanese and the Shanghai Macanese.  With the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941, the Macanese population, escaping the occupation, made its way to Macau as refugees. These Macanese, including many skilled workers and civil servants, were fluent in English and Portuguese and brought valuable commercial and technical skills to the colony. Another distinct group within the Macanese community is the \u4e0a\u6d77\u8461\u50d1; the descendants of Portuguese settlers from Shanghai that acted as middlemen between other foreigners and the Chinese in the \"Paris of the Orient\". They emigrated from Shanghai to Macau in 1949 with the coming of the Red Guard. Many spoke little Portuguese and were several generations removed from Portugal, speaking primarily English and Shanghainese, and/or Mandarin. The Shanghai Macanese carved a niche by teaching English in Macau. Only the children and grandchildren of Shanghainese settlers who were born and raised in Macau have the ability to speak Portuguese.\n\nA number of Macanese also emigrated during the [[Carnation Revolution]] and Macau's return to the People's Republic of China, respectively. Most potential emigrants looked to Brazil, Portugal's African territories, and Australia.\n\n===The Post-Colonial Period ===\nBeginning with the post-1974 independence of other Portuguese colonies and hastened by Macau's return to China, the Macanese community began to lose its Portuguese heritage. Many Portuguese, Eurasians and Chinese who were loyal to the Portuguese left after its return to China. Of those that remained, many children \u2013 including those of pure Chinese descent \u2013 switched from Portuguese- to English-medium high school education, particularly as many of parents recognised the diminishing value of Portuguese schooling. Many Macanese people of mixed ancestry since Portuguese time never speak Portuguese and speak only Cantonese as first language; if other Macanese people of mixed ancestry speak Portuguese, they speak it as second language, thus affected by Cantonese accent. At the same time, Macanese of pure Portuguese descent are also learning Cantonese and Mandarin to be able to communicate to non-Portuguese-speaking Chinese. Today, most Macanese \u2013 if they are still young enough \u2013 would go back to study to read and write Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Many see a niche role for fluent speakers of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Code-switching]] between Portuguese, Cantonese, and Mandarin among native speakers is common. In the 1980s Macanese or Portuguese women began to marry men who identified themselves as Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDvOJRO7qu8C&pg=PA165|title=InteBetween China and Europe: person, culture and emotion in Macao|author=Gary Jo\u00e3o de Pina-Cabral|year=2002|publisher=Berg Publishers|location=|page=165|isbn=0-8264-5749-5|accessdate=2010-07-14}}</ref>\n\n== Macanese identity dispute ==\nThere is some dispute around the exact meaning of \"Macanese\". An essay by Marreiros offers a broad spectrum of \"Macanese types\", ranging from Chinese Christian converts who live among the Portuguese to the descendants of old-established families of Portuguese lineage; all groups are integrated into this historically legitimated group.<ref name=marr94/> As a general rule, it is not a point of reference, however for ethnic Chinese living and raised in Macau; they often identify themselves as Chinese or Chinese from Macau; \"Macanese\" is applied to those people who have been acculturated through Western education and religion and are recognized by the Macanese community as being Macanese.<ref>There are many pretenders who have claimed to be Macanese. Although one's ethnic identity is a personal project, ultimately, any claim to a Macanese identity is either accepted or refuted by the already existing Macanese community on criteria dependent upon shared cultural heritage and collective notions (these criteria shift with each emerging generation). As Turner and later Bhabka suggest, identity is a layering of experiences unraveled through contact with others and is only decipherable within the social sphere. There are limits to a Macanese identity, and Pina-Cabral and Louren\u00e7o (op. cit.), offer a broad-based definition delineated by family and community acceptance as two basic denominators for a tentative definition of the Macanese.</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the basis for Macanese ethnic affiliation has been the use of the Portuguese language at home or some alliances with Portuguese cultural patterns and not solely determined along hereditary lines. Pina-Cabral and Louren\u00e7o suggest that this goal is reached \"namely through the Portuguese-language school-system\".<ref>Pina-Cabral and Louren\u00e7o (1993). Tentatively, language is not so much a key determinant to Macanese identity, but rather the alliance with the Portuguese cultural system that knowing Portuguese entails. A great number of Macanese families of Hong Kong only speak English but are still considered Macanese. Along these lines, knowledge of Portuguese is preferably \u2013 but not absolutely necessary \u2013 for a Macanese identity. It should be mentioned, however, that Portuguese language use is only one of several criteria that are used by other Macaense to determine other Macanese, not the sole determinant.</ref> Often, due to the close proximity to the Portuguese, the Macanese closely identify themselves with Portuguese nationals as opposed to Chinese in the bi-cultural and bi-racial equation. In practice, however, being Macanese is left up to how individuals categorize themselves.  \n\nIn the mid-1990s, there had been attempts by the Macau government to redefine the Macanese to be everyone born in Macau regardless of ethnicity, language or nationality.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Sovereignty at the Edge: Macau & the Question of Chineseness]]|first= Cathryn H. |last=Clayton |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2alTUjb6SX8C&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false 110]\u2013[https://books.google.com/books?id=2alTUjb6SX8C&pg=PA113 113] |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=2010|isbn=978-0674035454 }}</ref>  Since the re-integration of Macau with the People's Republic of China in late 1999, the traditional definitions are in a state of re-formulation.<ref>Shifting, not in the sense of deconstruction of the identity definition, but a re-formulation of the definition as each rising generation dictates. The current generation is looking toward the transition and finding themselves deciding upon their cultural/identity alignments. However, as Pina-Cabral and Louren\u00e7o explain, this is the nature of the Macanese community.</ref> Given the shifting political climate of Macau, some Macanese are coming to recognize and identify closer with a Chinese heritage.\n\nThis ambiguity might be reduced by the further adjective [[Creole peoples|crioulo]].\n\n==Prominent Macanese==\n{{see also|Category:Macanese people|Category:Hong Kong people of Portuguese descent}}\n\n===Arts & Letters===\n* [[Jos\u00e9 dos Santos Ferreira]] \u2013 poet\n* [[Henrique de Senna Fernandes]] \u2013 lawyer/writer\n\n===Entertainment===\n* \u674e\u5609\u6b23 [[Michelle Reis|Michelle Monique Reis]] \u2013 [[Miss Hong Kong Pageant|Miss Hong Kong]] 1988, socialite and actress\n* \u80a5\u5abd [[Maria Cordero]] \u2013 singer/actress\n* [[Alexander Lee Eusebio]], [[U-KISS]] former member and now a solo artist.\n* \u7956\u00b7\u5c0a\u5c3c\u4e9e [[Joe Junior]] (actual name: Jose Maria Rodrigues Jr.) \u2013 veteran singer & TV actor\n* The Pedruco Sisters \u2013 is a family of 4 Macanese sisters who have competed at the Miss Chinese International pageant and Miss World pageant representing Macau.\n* \u6881\u6d1b\u65bd [[Isabella Leong|Luisa Isabella Nolasco da Silva]] \u2013 Hong Kong-based actress, singer, and model\n* Louie Castro \u2013 household name in Hong Kong entertainment industry since the early 70s, singer, actor and radio personality\n* \u963f\u745e Ari Calangi \u2013 contestant on [[Sing!

Furthermore, in the midst of the [[Manila Galleon]] trade, a small number of Latinos settled in the ports of Macau in China and [[Ternate]] in Indonesia which were secondary connecting trade nodes to the primary trade-route between [[Manila, Philippines]] and [[Acapulco, Mexico]]; they intermarried with the Portuguese settlers and various Asian settlers; the first Latin Americans Asians were mostly [[Mexicans]] and to a lesser extent, [[Colombians]] and [[Peruvians]] who made their way to Asia (Mainly the Philippines) in the 16th century, the Latin-Americans who were sent to the Philippines and Macau from the Spanish colonies in America were often made up of [[Mulattoes]], [[Mestizos]] and Indios ([[Amerindians]]).<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16086/16086-h/16086-h.htm Letter from Fajardo to Felipe III From Manila, August 15 1620.(From the Spanish Archives of the Indies)]</ref>\n\n[[File:Macanese senhora.jpg|thumb|Macanese ''senhora'' in her traditional attire, the d\u00f3, early 20th century]]\nDuring the late-nineteenth century, and increasingly during [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]'s fascist [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, the upbringing of most Macanese fell along the lines of the continental Portuguese - attending Portuguese schools, participating in mandatory military service (some fought in Africa) and practising the [[Catholic]] faith. As recently as the 1980s, most Macanese had not received formal Chinese schooling and, hence, could speak but not read or write Chinese.  Spoken [[Cantonese]] was largely familiar, and some spoke the language with a regional accent (\u9109\u4e0b\u8a71) - acquired largely from their mothers or amahs.<ref>Of interest is the role that the amah plays in Macanese society. It is well known that local Cantonese women were often hired by the Catholic Church in Macau to act as wet-nurses for orphans in the Church's charge. These women were also hired by Macanese families to clean their houses, cook meals and care for their children. It is in these early encounters that Macanese children are first introduced to the Cantonese language and culture. Families are known to keep long-standing friendships with their amahs and in the past, young brides would sometimes bring them along with them to their new home. Nowadays Filipinas fill the role. c.f.

A large number of Macanese can trace their roots to these New Christians. Many of these Chinese were assimilated into the Macanese community, dropping their Chinese surnames and adopting Portuguese surnames.  In the collective Macanese folk memory, there is a little ditty about the parish of St. Lazarus Parish, called \u9032\u6559\u570d, where these Chinese converts lived: \u9032\u6559\u570d, \u5272\u8fae\u4ed4, \u5514\u4fc2\u59d3\u5ff5\u73e0 (Ros\u00e1rio)\u3000\u5c31\u4fc2\u59d3\u73ab\u7470 (Rosa). Hence, it is surmised that many Macanese with surnames of [[Rosario (surname)|Rosario]] or [[Rosa (surname)|Rosa]] probably were of Chinese ancestry.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  Because of this, there are many Eurasians carrying Portuguese surnames Rosario, Rosa, and others that are not Portuguese-blooded may be mistaken by others as Portuguese-blooded, and Eurasians of Portuguese blood carrying Portuguese surnames trace their Portuguese blood on maternal side.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} A visit to the St Michael the Archangel Cemetery (Cemit\u00e9rio S\u00e3o Miguel Arcanjo), the main Catholic cemetery near the St. Lazarus Parish, would reveal gravestones with a whole spectrum of Chinese and Portuguese heritage: Chinese with Portuguese baptised names with or without Portuguese surnames, Portuguese married with Chinese Catholics, and so on.\n\nThe mid-twentieth century, with the outbreak of the Second World War in the Pacific and the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, saw the Macanese population surge through the re-integration of two disparate Macanese communities: the Hong Kong Macanese and the Shanghai Macanese.  With the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941, the Macanese population, escaping the occupation, made its way to Macau as refugees. These Macanese, including many skilled workers and civil servants, were fluent in English and Portuguese and brought valuable commercial and technical skills to the colony. Another distinct group within the Macanese community is the \u4e0a\u6d77\u8461\u50d1; the descendants of Portuguese settlers from Shanghai that acted as middlemen between other foreigners and the Chinese in the \"Paris of the Orient\". They emigrated from Shanghai to Macau in 1949 with the coming of the Red Guard. Many spoke little Portuguese and were several generations removed from Portugal, speaking primarily English and Shanghainese, and/or Mandarin. The Shanghai Macanese carved a niche by teaching English in Macau. Only the children and grandchildren of Shanghainese settlers who were born and raised in Macau have the ability to speak Portuguese.\n\nA number of Macanese also emigrated during the [[Carnation Revolution]] and Macau's return to the People's Republic of China, respectively. Most potential emigrants looked to Brazil, Portugal's African territories, and Australia.\n\n===The Post-Colonial Period ===\nBeginning with the post-1974 independence of other Portuguese colonies and hastened by Macau's return to China, the Macanese community began to lose its Portuguese heritage. Many Portuguese, Eurasians and Chinese who were loyal to the Portuguese left after its return to China. Of those that remained, many children - including those of pure Chinese descent - switched from Portuguese- to English-medium high school education, particularly as many of parents recognised the diminishing value of Portuguese schooling. Many Macanese people of mixed ancestry since Portuguese time never speak Portuguese and speak only Cantonese as first language; if other Macanese people of mixed ancestry speak Portuguese, they speak it as second language, thus affected by Cantonese accent. At the same time, Macanese of pure Portuguese descent are also learning Cantonese and Mandarin to be able to communicate to non-Portuguese-speaking Chinese. Today, most Macanese - if they are still young enough - would go back to study to read and write Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Many see a niche role for fluent speakers of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Code-switching]] between Portuguese, Cantonese, and Mandarin among native speakers is common. In the 1980s Macanese or Portuguese women began to marry men who identified themselves as Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDvOJRO7qu8C&pg=PA165&dq=portuguese+women+marry+chinese#v=snippet&q=portuguese%20women%20marry%20men%20ethnically%20chinese&f=false|title=InteBetween China and Europe: person, culture and emotion in Macao|author=Gary Jo\u00e3o de Pina-Cabral|year=2002|publisher=Berg Publishers|location=|page=165|isbn=0-8264-5749-5|accessdate=2010-07-14}}</ref>\n\n== Macanese identity dispute ==\nThere is some dispute around the exact meaning of \"Macanese\". An essay by Marreiros offers a broad spectrum of \"Macanese types\", ranging from Chinese Christian converts who live among the Portuguese to the descendants of old-established families of Portuguese lineage; all groups are integrated into this historically legitimated group.<ref name=marr94/> As a general rule, it is not a point of reference, however for ethnic Chinese living and raised in Macau; they often identify themselves as Chinese or Chinese from Macau; \"Macanese\" is applied to those people who have been acculturated through Western education and religion and are recognized by the Macanese community as being Macanese.<ref>There are many pretenders who have claimed to be Macanese. Although one's ethnic identity is a personal project, ultimately, any claim to a Macanese identity is either accepted or refuted by the already existing Macanese community on criteria dependent upon shared cultural heritage and collective notions (these criteria shift with each emerging generation). As Turner and later Bhabka suggest, identity is a layering of experiences unraveled through contact with others and is only decipherable within the social sphere. There are limits to a Macanese identity, and Pina-Cabral and Louren\u00e7o (op. cit.), offer a broad-based definition delineated by family and community acceptance as two basic denominators for a tentative definition of the Macanese.</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the basis for Macanese ethnic affiliation has been the use of the Portuguese language at home or some alliances with Portuguese cultural patterns and not solely determined along hereditary lines. Pina-Cabral and Louren\u00e7o suggest that this goal is reached \"namely through the Portuguese-language school-system\".<ref>Pina-Cabral and Louren\u00e7o (1993). Tentatively, language is not so much a key determinant to Macanese identity, but rather the alliance with the Portuguese cultural system that knowing Portuguese entails. A great number of Macanese families of Hong Kong only speak English but are still considered Macanese. Along these lines, knowledge of Portuguese is preferably - but not absolutely necessary - for a Macanese identity. It should be mentioned, however, that Portuguese language use is only one of several criteria that are used by other Macaense to determine other Macanese, not the sole determinant.</ref> Often, due to the close proximity to the Portuguese, the Macanese closely identify themselves with Portuguese nationals as opposed to Chinese in the bi-cultural and bi-racial equation. In practice, however, being Macanese is left up to how individuals categorize themselves.  \n\nIn the mid-1990s, there had been attempts by the Macau government to redefine the Macanese to be everyone born in Macau regardless of ethnicity, language or nationality.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Sovereignty at the Edge: Macau & the Question of Chineseness]]|first= Cathryn H. |last=Clayton |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2alTUjb6SX8C&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false 110]&ndash;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2alTUjb6SX8C&pg=PA113 113] |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=2010|isbn=978-0674035454 }}</ref>  Since the re-integration of Macau with the People's Republic of China in late 1999, the traditional definitions are in a state of re-formulation.<ref>Shifting, not in the sense of deconstruction of the identity definition, but a re-formulation of the definition as each rising generation dictates. The current generation is looking toward the transition and finding themselves deciding upon their cultural/identity alignments. However, as Pina-Cabral and Louren\u00e7o explain, this is the nature of the Macanese community.</ref> Given the shifting political climate of Macau, some Macanese are coming to recognize and identify closer with a Chinese heritage.\n\nThis ambiguity might be reduced by the further adjective [[Creole peoples|crioulo]].\n\n==Prominent Macanese==\n{{see also|Category:Macanese people|Category:Hong Kong people of Portuguese descent}}\n\n===Arts & Letters===\n* [[Jos\u00e9 dos Santos Ferreira]] - poet\n* [[Henrique de Senna Fernandes]] - lawyer/writer\n\n===Entertainment===\n* \u674e\u5609\u6b23 [[Michelle Reis|Michelle Monique Reis]] - [[Miss Hong Kong Pageant|Miss Hong Kong]] 1988, socialite and actress\n* \u80a5\u5abd [[Maria Cordero]] - singer/actress\n* [[Alexander Lee Eusebio]], [[U-KISS]] former member and now a solo artist.\n* \u7956\u00b7\u5c0a\u5c3c\u4e9e [[Joe Junior]] (actual name: Jose Maria Rodrigues Jr.) - veteran singer & TV actor\n* The Pedruco Sisters - is a family of 4 Macanese sisters who have competed at the Miss Chinese International pageant and Miss World pageant representing Macau.\n* \u6881\u6d1b\u65bd [[Isabella Leong|Luisa Isabella Nolasco da Silva]] - Hong Kong-based actress, singer, and model\n* Louie Castro - household name in Hong Kong entertainment industry since the early 70s, singer, actor and radio personality\n* \u963f\u745e Ari Calangi - contestant on [[Sing!
