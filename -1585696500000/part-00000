The term '''Arthropoda''' as originally proposed refers to a proposed grouping of Euarthropods and the phylum [[Onychophora]].\n\nArthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and [[Arthropod cuticle|cuticle]] made of [[chitin]], often [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralised]] with [[calcium carbonate]]. The arthropod [[body plan]] consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by [[moulting]]. Arthropods are bilaterally symmetrical and their body possesses an [[exoskeleton|external skeleton]]. Some species have wings.\n\nTheir versatility has enabled arthropods to become the most species-rich members of all [[Guild (ecology)|ecological guilds]] in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80 percent of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most other animals, are very successful in dry environments. Arthropods range in size from the microscopic crustacean ''[[Stygotantulus]]'' up to the [[Japanese spider crab]].\n\nArthropods' primary internal cavity is a [[haemocoel]], which accommodates their internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and through which their [[haemolymph]] \u2013 analogue of [[blood]] \u2013 circulates; they have [[Circulatory system#Open circulatory system|open circulatory systems]]. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their [[nervous system]] is \"ladder-like\", with paired [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cords]] running through all segments and forming paired [[ganglia]] in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their [[brain]]s are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the [[esophagus]]. The [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[excretion|excretory]] systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the [[subphylum]] to which they belong. \n\nTheir vision relies on various combinations of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-pit [[ocelli]]: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information, but the main eyes of [[spider]]s are ocelli that can form images and, in a few cases, can swivel to track prey. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many bristles known as [[seta]]e that project through their cuticles.\n\nArthropods' methods of reproduction and development are diverse; all terrestrial species use [[internal fertilization]], but this is often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather than by direct injection. Aquatic species use either internal or [[external fertilization]]. Almost all arthropods lay eggs, but [[scorpion]]s give birth to live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mother. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and [[caterpillar]]s that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total [[metamorphosis]] to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.\n\nThe evolutionary ancestry of arthropods dates back to the [[Cambrian]] period. The group is generally regarded as [[monophyletic]], and many analyses support the placement of arthropods with [[cycloneuralia]]ns (or their constituent clades) in a superphylum [[Ecdysozoa]]. Overall, however, the [[basal (evolution)|basal]] relationships of animals are not yet well resolved. Likewise, the relationships between various arthropod groups are still actively debated. \n\nArthropods contribute to the human food supply both directly as food, and more importantly indirectly as [[pollination|pollinators]] of crops. Some species are known to spread severe disease to humans, [[livestock]], and crops.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word ''arthropod'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|\u1f04\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}} ''\u00e1rthron'', \"[[joint]]\", and {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2}} ''pous'' ([[genitive|gen.]] ''podos (\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2)''), i.e. \"foot\" or \"[[leg]]\", which together mean \"jointed leg\".<ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite web|title=Arthropoda|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Arthropoda&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|access-date=2013-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307075628/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Arthropoda&allowed_in_frame=0|archive-date=2013-03-07|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n\nArthropods are [[invertebrate]]s with [[Segmentation (biology)|segmented]] bodies and jointed limbs.<ref>{{citation |author=Valentine, J.

Setae are as varied in form and function as appendages.

Arthropods therefore replace their exoskeletons by undergoing [[ecdysis]] (moulting), or shedding the old exoskeleton after growing a new one that is not yet hardened. Moulting cycles run nearly continuously until an arthropod reaches full size.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 523\u2013524</ref>\n\nThe developmental stages between each moult (ecdysis) until sexual maturity is reached is called an [[instar]]. Differences between instars can often be seen in altered body proportions, colors, patterns, changes in the number of body segments or head width. After moulting, i.e. shedding their exoskeleton, the juvenile arthropods continue in their life cycle until they either pupate or moult again.\n\nIn the initial phase of moulting, the animal stops feeding and its epidermis releases moulting fluid, a mixture of [[enzyme]]s that digests the [[endocuticle]] and thus detaches the old cuticle. This phase begins when the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] has secreted a new [[epicuticle]] to protect it from the enzymes, and the epidermis secretes the new exocuticle while the old cuticle is detaching. When this stage is complete, the animal makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, and this makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest. It commonly takes several minutes for the animal to struggle out of the old cuticle. At this point, the new one is wrinkled and so soft that the animal cannot support itself and finds it very difficult to move, and the new endocuticle has not yet formed. The animal continues to pump itself up to stretch the new cuticle as much as possible, then hardens the new exocuticle and eliminates the excess air or water. By the end of this phase, the new endocuticle has formed. Many arthropods then eat the discarded cuticle to reclaim its materials.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\nBecause arthropods are unprotected and nearly immobilized until the new cuticle has hardened, they are in danger both of being trapped in the old cuticle and of being attacked by predators. Moulting may be responsible for 80 to 90% of all arthropod deaths.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\n=== Internal organs ===\n{{Annotated image/Basic arthropod internal structure}}\nArthropod bodies are also segmented internally, and the nervous, muscular, circulatory, and excretory systems have repeated components.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518\" /> Arthropods come from a lineage of animals that have a [[coelom]], a membrane-lined cavity between the gut and the body wall that accommodates the internal organs. The strong, segmented limbs of arthropods eliminate the need for one of the coelom's main ancestral functions, as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], which muscles compress in order to change the animal's shape and thus enable it to move. Hence the coelom of the arthropod is reduced to small areas around the reproductive and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a [[hemocoel]], a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which [[blood]] flows.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 527\u2013528</ref>\n\n=== Respiration and circulation ===\n{{See also|Hemolymph|hemocyte}}\nArthropods have open [[circulatory system]]s, although most have a few short, open-ended [[artery|arteries]]. In chelicerates and crustaceans, the blood carries [[oxygen]] to the tissues, while [[hexapoda|hexapods]] use a separate system of [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]]. Many crustaceans, but few chelicerates and [[tracheata|tracheates]], use [[respiratory pigment]]s to assist oxygen transport. The most common respiratory pigment in arthropods is [[copper]]-based [[hemocyanin]]; this is used by many crustaceans and a few [[centipede]]s. A few crustaceans and insects use iron-based [[hemoglobin]], the respiratory pigment used by [[vertebrate]]s. As with other invertebrates, the respiratory pigments of those arthropods that have them are generally dissolved in the blood and rarely enclosed in [[Blood cell|corpuscles]] as they are in vertebrates.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nThe heart is typically a muscular tube that runs just under the back and for most of the length of the hemocoel. It contracts in ripples that run from rear to front, pushing blood forwards. Sections not being squeezed by the heart muscle are expanded either by elastic [[ligament]]s or by small [[muscle]]s, in either case connecting the heart to the body wall. Along the heart run a series of paired ostia, non-return valves that allow blood to enter the heart but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nArthropods have a wide variety of respiratory systems. Small species often do not have any, since their high ratio of surface area to volume enables simple diffusion through the body surface to supply enough oxygen. Crustacea usually have gills that are modified appendages. Many arachnids have [[book lung]]s.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> Tracheae, systems of branching tunnels that run from the openings in the body walls, deliver oxygen directly to individual cells in many insects, myriapods and [[arachnid]]s.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 530, 733</ref>\n\n=== Nervous system ===\nLiving arthropods have paired main nerve cords running along their bodies below the gut, and in each segment the cords form a pair of [[ganglia]] from which [[sensory nerve|sensory]] and [[motor nerve|motor]] nerves run to other parts of the segment. Although the pairs of ganglia in each segment often appear physically fused, they are connected by [[commissure]]s (relatively large bundles of nerves), which give arthropod nervous systems a characteristic \"ladder-like\" appearance. The brain is in the head, encircling and mainly ''above'' the esophagus. It consists of the fused ganglia of the acron and one or two of the foremost segments that form the head&nbsp;\u2013 a total of three pairs of ganglia in most arthropods, but only two in chelicerates, which do not have antennae or the ganglion connected to them. The ganglia of other head segments are often close to the brain and function as part of it. In insects these other head ganglia combine into a pair of [[subesophageal ganglia]], under and behind the esophagus. Spiders take this process a step further, as ''all'' the [[segmental ganglia]] are incorporated into the subesophageal ganglia, which occupy most of the space in the cephalothorax (front \"super-segment\").<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P531To532\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 531\u2013532</ref>\n\n=== Excretory system ===\nThere are two different types of arthropod excretory systems. In aquatic arthropods, the end-product of biochemical reactions that [[metabolism|metabolise]] [[nitrogen]] is [[ammonia]], which is so toxic that it needs to be diluted as much as possible with water. The ammonia is then eliminated via any permeable membrane, mainly through the gills.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> All crustaceans use this system, and its high consumption of water may be responsible for the relative lack of success of crustaceans as land animals.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 529\u2013530</ref> Various groups of terrestrial arthropods have independently developed a different system: the end-product of nitrogen metabolism is [[uric acid]], which can be excreted as dry material; the [[Malpighian tubule system]] filters the uric acid and other nitrogenous waste out of the blood in the hemocoel, and dumps these materials into the hindgut, from which they are expelled as [[feces]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" /> Most aquatic arthropods and some terrestrial ones also have organs called [[nephridia]] (\"little [[kidney]]s\"), which extract other wastes for excretion as [[urine]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" />\n\n=== Senses ===\n\n==== Optical ====\n{{main|Arthropod eye}}\nThe stiff [[cuticle]]s of arthropods would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly [[seta]]e, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of [[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]], often by means of setae. Pressure sensors often take the form of membranes that function as [[eardrum]]s, but are connected directly to nerves rather than to [[auditory ossicle]]s. The [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of most hexapods include sensor packages that monitor [[humidity]], moisture and temperature.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 532\u2013537</ref>\n\n[[File:Wasp ocelli.JPG|240px|thumb|right|Head of a [[wasp]] with three ocelli (center), and compound eyes at the left and right]]\nMost arthropods have sophisticated visual systems that include one or more usually both of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-cup [[ocelli]] (\"little eyes\"). In most cases ocelli are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming, using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup. However, the main eyes of [[spider]]s are pigment-cup ocelli that are capable of forming images,<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" /> and those of [[jumping spider]]s can rotate to track prey.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 578\u2013580</ref>\n\nCompound eyes consist of fifteen to several thousand independent [[ommatidia]], columns that are usually [[hexagon]]al in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]. Each ommatidium is an independent sensor, with its own light-sensitive cells and often with its own [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and [[cornea]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" /> Compound eyes have a wide field of view, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the [[light polarization|polarization of light]].<ref>{{citation\n |url=http://www.suss-microoptics.com/downloads/Publications/Miniaturized_Imaging_Systems.pdf \n |doi=10.1016/S0167-9317(03)00102-3 \n |title=Miniaturized imaging systems \n |author1=V\u00f6lkel, R. \n |author2=Eisner, M. \n |author3=Weible, K.

The self-righting behavior of [[cockroach]]es is triggered when pressure sensors on the underside of the feet report no pressure. However, many [[malacostracan]] crustaceans have [[statocyst]]s, which provide the same sort of information as the balance and motion sensors of the vertebrate [[inner ear]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" />\n\nThe [[proprioceptor]]s of arthropods, sensors that report the force exerted by muscles and the degree of bending in the body and joints, are well understood.

However, most male [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] arthropods produce [[spermatophore]]s, waterproof packets of [[sperm]], which the females take into their bodies.

Instead, they proposed that three separate groups of \"arthropods\" evolved separately from common worm-like ancestors: the [[chelicerate]]s, including [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s; the crustaceans; and the [[uniramia]], consisting of [[onychophoran]]s, [[myriapod]]s and [[hexapoda|hexapods]]. These arguments usually bypassed [[trilobite]]s, as the evolutionary relationships of this class were unclear. Proponents of polyphyly argued the following: that the similarities between these groups are the results of [[convergent evolution]], as natural consequences of having rigid, segmented [[exoskeleton]]s; that the three groups use different chemical means of hardening the cuticle; that there were significant differences in the construction of their compound eyes; that it is hard to see how such different configurations of segments and appendages in the head could have evolved from the same ancestor; and that crustaceans have [[biramous]] limbs with separate gill and leg branches, while the other two groups have [[uniramous]] limbs in which the single branch serves as a leg.<ref>{{citation |author=Gillott, C. |title=Entomology |pages=17\u201319 |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-306-44967-3}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:right; width:auto; max-width:100%; border:solid 1px silver; padding:2px; margin:2px; font-size:80%;\">\n<div style=\"width:auto; border:solid 1px silver; padding:5px\">\n{{clade\n |1={{clade\n    |1=[[onychophora]]ns,<br />including ''[[Aysheaia]]'' and ''[[Peripatus]]''\n    |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n          |1=armored [[lobopod]]s,<br />including ''[[Hallucigenia]]'' and ''[[Microdictyon]]''\n          |2={{clade\n              |1=[[anomalocarid]]-like taxa,<br />including modern [[tardigrade]]s as<br />well as extinct animals like<br />''[[Kerygmachela]]'' and ''[[Opabinia]]''\n              |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Anomalocaris]]''\n                  |2=arthropods,<br />including living groups and<br />extinct forms such as [[trilobite]]s\n                 }}\n             }}\n         }}\n       }}\n    }}\n}}\n</div>Simplified summary of Budd's \"broad-scale\" cladogram (1996)<ref name=\"Budd1996\" /></div>\nFurther analysis and discoveries in the 1990s reversed this view, and led to acceptance that arthropods are [[monophyletic]], in other words they do share a common ancestor that was itself an arthropod.<ref>{{citation |author=Adrain, J. |title=Book Review: Arthropod Fossils and Phylogeny, edited by Gregory D.

The earliest known arthropods ate mud in order to extract food particles from it, and possessed variable numbers of segments with unspecialized appendages that functioned as both gills and legs. Anomalocarids were, by the standards of the time, huge and sophisticated predators with specialized mouths and grasping appendages, fixed numbers of segments some of which were specialized, tail fins, and gills that were very different from those of arthropods. This reasoning implies that ''[[Parapeytoia]]'', which has legs and a backward-pointing mouth like that of the earliest arthropods, is a more credible closest relative of arthropods than is ''[[Anomalocaris]]''.<ref>{{citation |author1=Bergstr\u00f6m, J. |author2=Hou, X.-G. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Arthropod origins |journal=[[Bulletin of Geosciences]] |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=323\u2013334 |year=2003 |url=http://www.geology.cz/bulletin/contents/2003/vol79no4/323_bergstrom.pdf |access-date=2008-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216220103/http://www.geology.cz/bulletin/contents/2003/vol79no4/323_bergstrom.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2006, they suggested that arthropods were more closely related to [[lobopod]]s and [[tardigrade]]s than to anomalocarids.<ref>{{citation |author1=Hou, X.-G. |author2=Bergstr\u00f6m, J. |author3=Jie, Y. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Distinguishing anomalocaridids from arthropods and priapulids |journal=[[Geological Journal]] |volume=41 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=259\u2013269 |year=2006 |doi=10.1002/gj.1050}}</ref> In 2014, research indicated that tardigrades were more closely related to arthropods than velvet worms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/misunderstood-worm-like-fossil-finds-its-place-in-the-tree-of-life|title=Misunderstood worm-like fossil finds its place in the Tree of Life|date=17 August 2014|access-date=24 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107150001/http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/misunderstood-worm-like-fossil-finds-its-place-in-the-tree-of-life|archive-date=7 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n<div style=\"float:right; width:auto; max-width:100%; border:solid 1px silver; padding:2px; margin:2px; font-size:80%;\">\n<div style=\"width:auto; border:solid 1px silver; padding:5px\">\n{{clade\n  |label1=[[Protostome]]s\n  |1={{clade\n|1=[[Chaetognatha]]\n|2={{clade\n       |1=[[Spiralia]] ([[annelid]]s, [[mollusc]]s, [[brachiopod]]s, etc.)\n       |label2=[[Ecdysozoa]]\n       |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Nematoida]] ([[nematode]]s and close relatives)\n            |2=[[Scalidophora]] ([[priapulid]]s and [[Kinorhyncha]], and [[Loricifera]])\n            |label3=[[Panarthropoda]]\n            |3={{clade\n                 |1=[[Onychophora]]ns\n                 |label2=[[Tactopoda]]\n                 |2={{clade\n                     |1=[[Tardigrade]]s\n                 |label2=Euarthropoda\n                 |2={{clade\n                      |1=[[Chelicerate]]s\n                      |label2=[[Mandibulata]]\n                      |2={{clade\n                           |1=\u2020[[Euthycarcinoid]]s\n                           |2={{clade\n                                |1=[[Myriapod]]s\n                                |label2=[[Pancrustacea]]\n                                |2={{clade\n                                     |1=[[Crustacean]]s\n                                     |2=[[Hexapoda|Hexapods]]\n                                    }}\n                              }}\n                         }}\n                    }}\n               }}\n          }}\n     }}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n</div>Relationships of Ecdysozoa to each other and to annelids, etc.,<ref name=\"TelfordBourlatEtAl2008EvolutionOfEcdysozoa\" /> including euthycarcinoids<ref name=\"Vaccari2004\">{{citation |author1=Vaccari, N.

There had been competing proposals that arthropods were closely related to other groups such as [[nematode]]s, [[priapulid]]s and [[tardigrade]]s, but these remained minority views because it was difficult to specify in detail the relationships between these groups.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic]] analyses of [[DNA]] sequences produced a coherent scheme showing arthropods as members of a [[superphylum]] labelled Ecdysozoa (\"animals that moult\"), which contained nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades but excluded annelids. This was backed up by studies of the anatomy and development of these animals, which showed that many of the features that supported the Articulata hypothesis showed significant differences between annelids and the earliest Panarthropods in their details, and some were hardly present at all in arthropods. This hypothesis groups annelids with molluscs and [[brachiopod]]s in another superphylum, [[Lophotrochozoa]].\n\nIf the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is correct, then segmentation of arthropods and annelids either has evolved [[Convergent evolution|convergently]] or has been inherited from a much older ancestor and subsequently lost in several other lineages, such as the non-arthropod members of the Ecdysozoa.<ref>{{citation |author1=Schmidt-Rhaesa, A. |author2=Bartolomaeus, T. |author3=Lemburg, C. |author4=Ehlers, U. |author5=Garey, J.

The term '''Arthropoda''' as originally proposed refers to a proposed grouping of Euarthropods and the phylum [[Onychophora]].\n\nArthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and [[Arthropod cuticle|cuticle]] made of [[chitin]], often [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralised]] with [[calcium carbonate]]. The arthropod [[body plan]] consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by [[moulting]]. Arthropods are bilaterally symmetrical and their body possesses an [[exoskeleton|external skeleton]]. Some species have wings.\n\nTheir versatility has enabled arthropods to become the most species-rich members of all [[Guild (ecology)|ecological guilds]] in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80 percent of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most other animals, are very successful in dry environments. Arthropods range in size from the microscopic crustacean ''[[Stygotantulus]]'' up to the [[Japanese spider crab]].\n\nArthropods' primary internal cavity is a [[haemocoel]], which accommodates their internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and through which their [[haemolymph]] \u2013 analogue of [[blood]] \u2013 circulates; they have [[Circulatory system#Open circulatory system|open circulatory systems]]. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their [[nervous system]] is \"ladder-like\", with paired [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cords]] running through all segments and forming paired [[ganglia]] in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their [[brain]]s are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the [[esophagus]]. The [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[excretion|excretory]] systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the [[subphylum]] to which they belong. \n\nTheir vision relies on various combinations of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-pit [[ocelli]]: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information, but the main eyes of [[spider]]s are ocelli that can form images and, in a few cases, can swivel to track prey. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many bristles known as [[seta]]e that project through their cuticles.\n\nArthropods' methods of reproduction and development are diverse; all terrestrial species use [[internal fertilization]], but this is often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather than by direct injection. Aquatic species use either internal or [[external fertilization]]. Almost all arthropods lay eggs, but [[scorpion]]s give birth to live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mother. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and [[caterpillar]]s that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total [[metamorphosis]] to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.\n\nThe evolutionary ancestry of arthropods dates back to the [[Cambrian]] period. The group is generally regarded as [[monophyletic]], and many analyses support the placement of arthropods with [[cycloneuralia]]ns (or their constituent clades) in a superphylum [[Ecdysozoa]]. Overall, however, the [[basal (evolution)|basal]] relationships of animals are not yet well resolved. Likewise, the relationships between various arthropod groups are still actively debated. \n\nArthropods contribute to the human food supply both directly as food, and more importantly indirectly as [[pollination|pollinators]] of crops.

Arthropods therefore replace their exoskeletons by undergoing [[ecdysis]] (moulting), or shedding the old exoskeleton after growing a new one that is not yet hardened. Moulting cycles run nearly continuously until an arthropod reaches full size.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 523\u2013524</ref>\n\nThe developmental stages between each moult (ecdysis) until sexual maturity is reached is called an [[instar]]. Differences between instars can often be seen in altered body proportions, colors, patterns, changes in the number of body segments or head width. After moulting, i.e. shedding their exoskeleton, the juvenile arthropods continue in their life cycle until they either pupate or moult again.\n\nIn the initial phase of moulting, the animal stops feeding and its epidermis releases moulting fluid, a mixture of [[enzyme]]s that digests the [[endocuticle]] and thus detaches the old cuticle. This phase begins when the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] has secreted a new [[epicuticle]] to protect it from the enzymes, and the epidermis secretes the new exocuticle while the old cuticle is detaching. When this stage is complete, the animal makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, and this makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest. It commonly takes several minutes for the animal to struggle out of the old cuticle. At this point, the new one is wrinkled and so soft that the animal cannot support itself and finds it very difficult to move, and the new endocuticle has not yet formed. The animal continues to pump itself up to stretch the new cuticle as much as possible, then hardens the new exocuticle and eliminates the excess air or water. By the end of this phase, the new endocuticle has formed. Many arthropods then eat the discarded cuticle to reclaim its materials.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\nBecause arthropods are unprotected and nearly immobilized until the new cuticle has hardened, they are in danger both of being trapped in the old cuticle and of being attacked by predators. Moulting may be responsible for 80 to 90% of all arthropod deaths.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\n=== Internal organs ===\n{{Annotated image/Basic arthropod internal structure}}\nArthropod bodies are also segmented internally, and the nervous, muscular, circulatory, and excretory systems have repeated components.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518\" /> Arthropods come from a lineage of animals that have a [[coelom]], a membrane-lined cavity between the gut and the body wall that accommodates the internal organs. The strong, segmented limbs of arthropods eliminate the need for one of the coelom's main ancestral functions, as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], which muscles compress in order to change the animal's shape and thus enable it to move. Hence the coelom of the arthropod is reduced to small areas around the reproductive and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a [[hemocoel]], a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which [[blood]] flows.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 527\u2013528</ref>\n\n=== Respiration and circulation ===\n{{See also|Hemolymph|hemocyte}}\nArthropods have open [[circulatory system]]s, although most have a few short, open-ended [[artery|arteries]]. In chelicerates and crustaceans, the blood carries [[oxygen]] to the tissues, while [[hexapoda|hexapods]] use a separate system of [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]]. Many crustaceans, but few chelicerates and [[tracheata|tracheates]], use [[respiratory pigment]]s to assist oxygen transport. The most common respiratory pigment in arthropods is [[copper]]-based [[hemocyanin]]; this is used by many crustaceans and a few [[centipede]]s. A few crustaceans and insects use iron-based [[hemoglobin]], the respiratory pigment used by [[vertebrate]]s. As with other invertebrates, the respiratory pigments of those arthropods that have them are generally dissolved in the blood and rarely enclosed in [[Blood cell|corpuscles]] as they are in vertebrates.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nThe heart is typically a muscular tube that runs just under the back and for most of the length of the hemocoel. It contracts in ripples that run from rear to front, pushing blood forwards. Sections not being squeezed by the heart muscle are expanded either by elastic [[ligament]]s or by small [[muscle]]s, in either case connecting the heart to the body wall. Along the heart run a series of paired ostia, non-return valves that allow blood to enter the heart but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nArthropods have a wide variety of respiratory systems. Small species often do not have any, since their high ratio of surface area to volume enables simple diffusion through the body surface to supply enough oxygen. Crustacea usually have gills that are modified appendages. Many arachnids have [[book lung]]s.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> Tracheae, systems of branching tunnels that run from the openings in the body walls, deliver oxygen directly to individual cells in many insects, myriapods and [[arachnid]]s.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 530, 733</ref>\n\n=== Nervous system ===\nLiving arthropods have paired main nerve cords running along their bodies below the gut, and in each segment the cords form a pair of [[ganglia]] from which [[sensory nerve|sensory]] and [[motor nerve|motor]] nerves run to other parts of the segment. Although the pairs of ganglia in each segment often appear physically fused, they are connected by [[commissure]]s (relatively large bundles of nerves), which give arthropod nervous systems a characteristic \"ladder-like\" appearance. The brain is in the head, encircling and mainly ''above'' the esophagus. It consists of the fused ganglia of the acron and one or two of the foremost segments that form the head&nbsp;\u2013 a total of three pairs of ganglia in most arthropods, but only two in chelicerates, which do not have antennae or the ganglion connected to them. The ganglia of other head segments are often close to the brain and function as part of it. In insects these other head ganglia combine into a pair of [[subesophageal ganglia]], under and behind the esophagus. Spiders take this process a step further, as ''all'' the [[segmental ganglia]] are incorporated into the subesophageal ganglia, which occupy most of the space in the cephalothorax (front \"super-segment\").<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P531To532\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 531\u2013532</ref>\n\n=== Excretory system ===\nThere are two different types of arthropod excretory systems. In aquatic arthropods, the end-product of biochemical reactions that [[metabolism|metabolise]] [[nitrogen]] is [[ammonia]], which is so toxic that it needs to be diluted as much as possible with water. The ammonia is then eliminated via any permeable membrane, mainly through the gills.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> All crustaceans use this system, and its high consumption of water may be responsible for the relative lack of success of crustaceans as land animals.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 529\u2013530</ref> Various groups of terrestrial arthropods have independently developed a different system: the end-product of nitrogen metabolism is [[uric acid]], which can be excreted as dry material; the [[Malpighian tubule system]] filters the uric acid and other nitrogenous waste out of the blood in the hemocoel, and dumps these materials into the hindgut, from which they are expelled as [[feces]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" /> Most aquatic arthropods and some terrestrial ones also have organs called [[nephridia]] (\"little [[kidney]]s\"), which extract other wastes for excretion as [[urine]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" />\n\n=== Senses ===\n\n==== Optical ====\n{{main|Arthropod eye}}\nThe stiff [[cuticle]]s of arthropods would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly [[seta]]e, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of [[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]], often by means of setae. Pressure sensors often take the form of membranes that function as [[eardrum]]s, but are connected directly to nerves rather than to [[auditory ossicle]]s. The [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of most hexapods include sensor packages that monitor [[humidity]], moisture and temperature.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 532\u2013537</ref>\n\n[[File:Wasp ocelli.JPG|240px|thumb|right|Head of a [[wasp]] with three ocelli (center), and compound eyes at the left and right]]\nMost arthropods have sophisticated visual systems that include one or more usually both of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-cup [[ocelli]] (\"little eyes\"). In most cases ocelli are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming, using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup. However, the main eyes of [[spider]]s are pigment-cup ocelli that are capable of forming images,<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" /> and those of [[jumping spider]]s can rotate to track prey.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 578\u2013580</ref>\n\nCompound eyes consist of fifteen to several thousand independent [[ommatidia]], columns that are usually [[hexagon]]al in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]].

The self-righting behavior of [[cockroach]]es is triggered when pressure sensors on the underside of the feet report no pressure.

Instead, they proposed that three separate groups of \"arthropods\" evolved separately from common worm-like ancestors: the [[chelicerate]]s, including [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s; the crustaceans; and the [[uniramia]], consisting of [[onychophoran]]s, [[myriapod]]s and [[hexapoda|hexapods]]. These arguments usually bypassed [[trilobite]]s, as the evolutionary relationships of this class were unclear. Proponents of polyphyly argued the following: that the similarities between these groups are the results of [[convergent evolution]], as natural consequences of having rigid, segmented [[exoskeleton]]s; that the three groups use different chemical means of hardening the cuticle; that there were significant differences in the construction of their compound eyes; that it is hard to see how such different configurations of segments and appendages in the head could have evolved from the same ancestor; and that crustaceans have [[biramous]] limbs with separate gill and leg branches, while the other two groups have [[uniramous]] limbs in which the single branch serves as a leg.<ref>{{citation |author=Gillott, C. |title=Entomology |pages=17\u201319 |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-306-44967-3}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:right; width:auto; max-width:100%; border:solid 1px silver; padding:2px; margin:2px; font-size:80%;\">\n<div style=\"width:auto; border:solid 1px silver; padding:5px\">\n{{clade\n |1={{clade\n    |1=[[onychophora]]ns,<br />including ''[[Aysheaia]]'' and ''[[Peripatus]]''\n    |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n          |1=armored [[lobopod]]s,<br />including ''[[Hallucigenia]]'' and ''[[Microdictyon]]''\n          |2={{clade\n              |1=[[anomalocarid]]-like taxa,<br />including modern [[tardigrade]]s as<br />well as extinct animals like<br />''[[Kerygmachela]]'' and ''[[Opabinia]]''\n              |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Anomalocaris]]''\n                  |2=arthropods,<br />including living groups and<br />extinct forms such as [[trilobite]]s\n                 }}\n             }}\n         }}\n       }}\n    }}\n}}\n</div>Simplified summary of Budd's \"broad-scale\" cladogram (1996)<ref name=\"Budd1996\" /></div>\nFurther analysis and discoveries in the 1990s reversed this view, and led to acceptance that arthropods are [[monophyletic]], in other words they do share a common ancestor that was itself an arthropod.<ref>{{citation |author=Adrain, J. |title=Book Review: Arthropod Fossils and Phylogeny, edited by Gregory D.

The earliest known arthropods ate mud in order to extract food particles from it, and possessed variable numbers of segments with unspecialized appendages that functioned as both gills and legs. Anomalocarids were, by the standards of the time, huge and sophisticated predators with specialized mouths and grasping appendages, fixed numbers of segments some of which were specialized, tail fins, and gills that were very different from those of arthropods.

There had been competing proposals that arthropods were closely related to other groups such as [[nematode]]s, [[priapulid]]s and [[tardigrade]]s, but these remained minority views because it was difficult to specify in detail the relationships between these groups.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic]] analyses of [[DNA]] sequences produced a coherent scheme showing arthropods as members of a [[superphylum]] labelled Ecdysozoa (\"animals that moult\"), which contained nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades but excluded annelids. This was backed up by studies of the anatomy and development of these animals, which showed that many of the features that supported the Articulata hypothesis showed significant differences between annelids and the earliest Panarthropods in their details, and some were hardly present at all in arthropods. This hypothesis groups annelids with molluscs and [[brachiopod]]s in another superphylum, [[Lophotrochozoa]].\n\nIf the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is correct, then segmentation of arthropods and annelids either has evolved [[Convergent evolution|convergently]] or has been inherited from a much older ancestor and subsequently lost in several other lineages, such as the non-arthropod members of the Ecdysozoa.<ref>{{citation |author1=Schmidt-Rhaesa, A. |author2=Bartolomaeus, T. |author3=Lemburg, C. |author4=Ehlers, U. |author5=Garey, J.

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised.

He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film he wrote thereafter.<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie\u2014''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi]]'' (1965), \"International Secret Police: Key of Keys\"\u2014was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films.

''Annie Hall'' (1977) won four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for [[Diane Keaton]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Woody Allen. ''Annie Hall'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes Keaton wore in the film.

As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else.

''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' was adapted from ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]''. In ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''. ''[[Amarcord]]'' inspired ''[[Radio Days]]''. ''[[September (1987 film)|September]]'' resembles ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''. Allen uses many elements from ''Wild Strawberries''.

Film critic Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' praised it.<ref name=\"wrecks\">{{cite news |last1=Canby |first1=Vincent |title=Anthologies Can Be A Bargain |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/12/movies/film-view-anthologies-can-be-a-bargain.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=November 14, 2018 |date=March 12, 1989}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nAllen's 1991 film ''[[Shadows and Fog]]'' is a black-and-white homage to the [[German Expressionism|German expressionists]] and features the music of [[Kurt Weill]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dowd |first1=A.A. |title=Woody does German Expressionism in Shadows and Fog |url=https://www.avclub.com/article/woody-does-german-expressionism-in-ishadows-and-fo-100754 |website=[[The A.V.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).\n\nDuring this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAllen made one sitcom \"appearance\" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, \"My Dinner with Woody\", that paid tribute to several of his films.

According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been \"violated\".

She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.\n\nIn 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised.

Feldman]] production ''[[What's New, Pussycat?]]'' (1965), for which he wrote the screenplay. He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film he wrote thereafter.<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie\u2014''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi]]'' (1965), \"International Secret Police: Key of Keys\"\u2014was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films. Those films eventually became ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> ''Sleeper'' was the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]].<ref name=\"Liebenson\">{{cite web |last1=Liebenson |first1=Donald |title=The Annie Hall That Might Have Been: Inside Woody Allen's Anhedonia |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/annie-hall-40th-anniversary-woody-allen-carol-kane-marshall-brickman |website=vanityfair.com |accessdate=November 14, 2018 |date=April 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"partners\">{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Matt |last2=Johnson|first2=Claudia |title=Script Partners: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvbdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=March 31, 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-317-41792-7|pages=37\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]] and co-starring Diane Keaton.

''Annie Hall'' (1977) won four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for [[Diane Keaton]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Woody Allen. ''Annie Hall'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes Keaton wore in the film. In an interview with journalist [[Katie Couric]], Keaton did not deny that Allen wrote the part for her and about her.<ref name=Couric>{{YouTube|blGicJHQZdo|\"Annie Hall Interview with Diane Keaton by Katie Couric\"}}, video interview, 2 min.</ref> The film is ranked 35th on the ''[[American Film Institute]]''{{'s}} \"100 Best Movies\" and fourth on the AFI list of the \"100 Best Comedies.\"\n\n''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979) is a black-and-white film often viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else. He's bold. He's got a lot of strength, a lot of courage in terms of his work. And that is what it takes to do something really unique. Along with a genius imagination.\"<ref name=Couric />\n\n=== 1980s ===\nAllen's 1980s films, even the comedies, have somber and philosophical undertones, and are influenced by European directors, specifically [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]]. ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' was based on ''[[8\u00bd]]'', which it parodies, and ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''. ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' was adapted from ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]''. In ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''. ''[[Amarcord]]'' inspired ''[[Radio Days]]''. ''[[September (1987 film)|September]]'' resembles ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''. Allen uses many elements from ''Wild Strawberries''. In ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', Allen references a scene from ''Wild Strawberries''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilmington|first1=Michael|title=rectors (Page 2 of 2) COMMENTARY : Woody Allen Keeps the Faith : 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' tears down the wall between his serious and comic sides (Page 2)|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-22/entertainment/ca-984_1_woody-allen-movie/2|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=April 13, 2016|date=October 22, 1989}}</ref>\n\n''Stardust Memories'' (1980) features Sandy Bates, a successful filmmaker played by Allen, who expresses resentment and scorn for his fans.

In 1989 Allen and directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] made ''[[New York Stories]]'', an [[anthology film]] about New Yorkers.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).\n\nDuring this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAllen made one sitcom \"appearance\" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, \"My Dinner with Woody\", that paid tribute to several of his films.

''Small Time Crooks'' was a relative financial success, grossing over $17 million domestically, but Allen's next four films foundered at the box office, including Allen's most costly film, ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]'' (with a budget of $26 million).

His first great success was ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'', which opened in 1968, and ran for 598 performances for almost two years on Broadway. His success continued with ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', which opened in 1969, starring Allen and [[Diane Keaton]]. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]], although none of the nominations were for Allen's writing or acting.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=2849 |title=Internet Broadway Database: Play It Again, Sam Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb |date=March 14, 1970 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s Allen wrote a number of one-act plays, most notably ''[[God (play)|God]]'' and ''[[Death (play)|Death]]'', which were published in his 1975 collection ''[[Without Feathers]]''. In 1981 Allen's play ''[[The Floating Light Bulb]]'' opened on Broadway. It was a critical success and a commercial flop. Despite two [[Tony Award]] nominations, a Tony win for the acting of [[Brian Backer]] (who won the 1981 [[Theater World Award]] and a [[Drama Desk Award]] for his work), the play only ran for 62 performances.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4112 |title=Internet Broadway Database: The Floating Light Bulb Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb.com |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref> After a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to the theatre in 1995 with the one-act ''Central Park West'', an installment in an evening of theatre, ''Death Defying Acts'', that also included new work by [[David Mamet]] and [[Elaine May]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |title=Death Defying Acts and No One Shall Be Immune \u2013 David Mamet Society |publisher=Mamet.eserver.org |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224171536/http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |archive-date=February 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor the next few years Allen had no direct involvement with the stage, but notable productions of his work were staged.

In his mid-1960s album ''Standup Comic'', Allen said that Rosen had sued him because of a joke he made in an interview. Rosen had been [[raped|sexually assaulted]] outside her apartment. According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been \"violated\".

They divorced in 1970. Lasser appeared in three of Allen's films: ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', and ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]''. She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.\n\nIn 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.
