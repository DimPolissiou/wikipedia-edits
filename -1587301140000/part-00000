The site was established in the late 1990s by Magyar Telekom and gradually evolved its investigative journalistic brand. In 2013, Origo wast Hungary's most-read news website known for its investigative journalism. Magyar Telekom was acquired by the German [[Deutsche Telekom]] (DT) in 2005. In 2010, DT encountered a hostile business environment fostered by the new Fidesz government which adopted punitive measures against foreign owners of domestic companies. During DT's negotiations with the Hungarian government over telecommunications policy, a senior Fidesz official (J\u00e1nos L\u00e1z\u00e1r) suggested a covert line of communication between the government and Origo editors because \"Origo's journalists had historically struggled to grasp the government's perspective on certain matters\". Origo signed a contract with a media consultancy firm run by Attila V\u00e1rhegyi, a former senior Fidesz member, after which the telecommunications deal was finailized on terms favourable to DT. This resulted in a revolt of Origo employees and editors. During the first half of 2014, political interference in journalists' work and editorial policy began to become noticeable, according to one former employee. After one Origo journalist launched an investigation of L\u00e1z\u00e1r's foreign travel expenses despite V\u00e1rhegyi's firm's requests to slow the investigation, L\u00e1z\u00e1r complained to Magyar Telekom executives in 2014. Origo, headed by a combative editor-in-chief (Gerg\u0151 S\u00e1ling) protecting a tenacious investigative reporter, persisted in scrutinising L\u00e1z\u00e1r's record and eventually launched court proceedings to obtain documents regarding L\u00e1z\u00e1r while also publishing several pieces unfavourable to L\u00e1z\u00e1r. After Orb\u00e1n re-election and months of pressure, Magyar Telekom gave in and fired the editor shielding the investigations. Several journalists resigned in protest. Regarding it as a political liability, Magyar Telekom decided to sell Origo. In an open sale process, businesspeople close to the ruling party purchased the news outlet. By 2018, Origo's coverage took a steadfastly pro-government stance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/europe/hungary-viktor-orban-media.html|title=The Website That Shows How a Free Press Can Die|last=Kingsley|first=Patrick|date=24 November 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 March 2019|last2=Novak|first2=Benjamin|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-02-12/orb-n-rises-hungarys-free-press-falls|title=As Orb\u00e1n rises, Hungary's free press falls|website=Public Radio International|access-date=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2018, over 400 news media outlets \u2013 most of the private media in the country \u2013 were consolidated into a central holding company, the [[Central European Press and Media Foundation]], administered by people close to the government.

Facing widespread opposition, the government reduced the proposed tax rates, however, discontent and protests continued. The design of the tax was also criticized by the [[European Commission]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-internet-protest-idUSKBN0IH29M20141029|title=Around 100,000 Hungarians rally for democracy as internet tax hits...|date=29 October 2014|agency=Reuters|access-date=14 March 2019}}</ref> The plan was eventually scrapped by the government entirely.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29846285|title=Hungary scraps controversial web tax|date=31 October 2014|access-date=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Overtime law ====\nIn late 2018, the government amended the labour code to increase maximum overtime from 250h to 400h, and delaying the employee compensation deadline from 1 to 3 years.

The changes were motivated by the country's labour shortage, and sparked a wave of protests and opposition.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/22/world/europe/hungary-slave-law.html|title=What Is Hungary's \u2018Slave Law,\u2019 and Why Has It Provoked Opposition?|last=Karasz|first=Palko|date=22 December 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=13 March 2019|last2=Kingsley|first2=Patrick|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Opponents dubbed the proposed changes the \"''Slave law''\".

The protests, with the number of attendants peaking at about 15,000, have been one of the most significant shows of public opposition to the Fidesz government, but have fallen far short of the wast political support the party enjoys within Hungary.

The site was established in the late 1990s by Magyar Telekom and gradually evolved its investigative journalistic brand. In 2013, Origo wast Hungary's most-read news website known for its investigative journalism. Magyar Telekom was acquired by the German [[Deutsche Telekom]] (DT) in 2005. In 2010, DT encountered a hostile business environment fostered by the new Fidesz government which adopted punitive measures against foreign owners of domestic companies. During DT's negotiations with the Hungarian government over telecommunications policy, a senior Fidesz official (J\u00e1nos L\u00e1z\u00e1r) suggested a covert line of communication between the government and Origo editors because \"Origo's journalists had historically struggled to grasp the government's perspective on certain matters\". Origo signed a contract with a media consultancy firm run by Attila V\u00e1rhegyi, a former senior Fidesz member, after which the telecommunications deal was finailized on terms favourable to DT. This resulted in a revolt of Origo employees and editors. During the first half of 2014, political interference in journalists' work and editorial policy began to become noticeable, according to one former employee. After one Origo journalist launched an investigation of L\u00e1z\u00e1r's foreign travel expenses despite V\u00e1rhegyi's firm's requests to slow the investigation, L\u00e1z\u00e1r complained to Magyar Telekom executives in 2014. Origo, headed by a combative editor-in-chief (Gerg\u0151 S\u00e1ling) protecting a tenacious investigative reporter, persisted in scrutinising L\u00e1z\u00e1r's record and eventually launched court proceedings to obtain documents regarding L\u00e1z\u00e1r while also publishing several pieces unfavourable to L\u00e1z\u00e1r. After Orb\u00e1n re-election and months of pressure, Magyar Telekom gave in and fired the editor shielding the investigations. Several journalists resigned in protest. Regarding it as a political liability, Magyar Telekom decided to sell Origo. In an open sale process, businesspeople close to the ruling party purchased the news outlet. By 2018, Origo's coverage took a steadfastly pro-government stance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/europe/hungary-viktor-orban-media.html|title=The Website That Shows How a Free Press Can Die|last=Kingsley|first=Patrick|date=24 November 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 March 2019|last2=Novak|first2=Benjamin|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-02-12/orb-n-rises-hungarys-free-press-falls|title=As Orb\u00e1n rises, Hungary's free press falls|website=Public Radio International|access-date=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2018, over 400 news media outlets \u2013 most of the private media in the country \u2013 were consolidated into a central holding company, the [[Central European Press and Media Foundation]], administered by people close to the government.

{"title_page": "Sakha names", "text_new": "\n\nAfter the [[Sakha people]] adopted Christianity from the [[Russians]], they began to use Russian clerical names in official concerns. The naming conventions are similar to those of [[Names_in_Russian_Empire,_Soviet_Union_and_CIS_countries|Russian names]].\n\nThe original Sakha names were used in unofficial settings, but eventually the official clerical names dominated.

Most personal computers possess a [[Computer monitor|monitor]], a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], and a [[computer case]]. The computer case encloses and holds all of the necessary hardware required to store and process data on the computer. The motherboard ensures that all other inner computer hardware communicates with each other. The CPU executes instructions for running computer programs. RAM is responsible for the temporary storage of data while the computer operates.\n\n[[Laptop]]s are designed for portability and are generally very similar to PCs,<ref name=\"PC hardware\" /> although they may use lower-power or reduced size components, thus lower performance for a given price point.<ref name=\"desktopvslaptopcomputer\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001399.htm |title=Desktop computer vs. Laptop computer |date=2019-12-30 |website=www.computerhope.com |access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref> Due to their portability, all units of computer hardware in a laptop are integrated within the laptop's computer case. The monitor is found in the upper cover of the laptop, and it and the laptop itself can be secured by closing the cover. Instead of a mouse, laptops usually may have a [[trackpad]] attached below the in-built keyboard.\n\n====Case====\n{{Main|Computer case}}\n\nThe computer case encloses and holds most of the components of the system. It provides mechanical support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard, disk drives, and power supplies, and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components. The case is also part of the system to control electromagnetic interference radiated by the computer and protects internal parts from electrostatic discharge. Large tower cases provide extra internal space for multiple disk drives or other peripherals and usually stand on the floor, while desktop cases provide less expansion room. All-in-one style designs include a video display built into the same case. Portable and laptop computers require cases that provide impact protection for the unit. A current development in laptop computers is a detachable keyboard, which allows the system to be configured as a touch-screen tablet. Hobbyists may decorate the cases with colored lights, paint, or other features, in an activity called [[case modding]].\n\n====Power supply====\n{{Main|Power supply unit (computer)|l1=Power supply unit}}\n\nA power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage direct current (DC) power for the internal components of the computer.

The CPU is a [[microprocessor]], which is [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] on a [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chip. It is usually [[CPU cooling|cooled]] by a heat sink and fan, or water-cooling system. Most newer CPU includes an on-die [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). The [[clock speed]] of CPU governs how fast it executes instructions and is measured in GHz; typical values lie between 1&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz. Many modern computers have the option to overclock the CPU which enhances performance at the expense of greater thermal output and thus a need for improved cooling.\n* The [[chipset]], which includes the [[Northbridge (computing)|north bridge]], mediates communication between the CPU and the other components of the system, including main memory; as well as [[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]], which is connected to the north bridge, and supports auxiliary interfaces and buses; and, finally, a [[Super I/O]] chip, connected through the south bridge, which supports the slowest and most legacy components like [[serial port]]s, [[hardware monitoring]] and [[fan control]].\n*[[Random-access memory]] (RAM), which stores the code and data that are being actively accessed by the CPU. For example, when a web browser is opened on the computer it takes up memory; this is stored in the RAM until the web browser is closed. It is typically a type of [[dynamic RAM]] (DRAM), such as [[synchronous DRAM]] (SDRAM), where [[MOS memory]] chips store data on [[memory cell (computing)|memory cells]] consisting of MOSFETs and [[MOS capacitor]]s. RAM usually comes on [[dual in-line memory module]]s (DIMMs) in the sizes of 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB, but can be much larger.\n*[[Read-only memory]] (ROM), which stores the [[BIOS]] that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution, a process known as [[Bootstrapping (computing)|Bootstrapping]], or \"[[booting]]\" or \"booting up\". The ROM is typically a [[nonvolatile BIOS memory]] chip, which stores data on [[floating-gate MOSFET]] memory cells.\n** The [[BIOS]] (Basic Input Output System) includes boot [[firmware]] and power management firmware. Newer motherboards use [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface]] (UEFI) instead of BIOS.\n*[[Bus (computing)|Buses]] that connect the CPU to various internal components and to expand cards for graphics and sound.\n* The [[CMOS]] (complementary MOS) [[electric battery|battery]], which powers the [[CMOS memory]] for date and time in the BIOS chip. This battery is generally a [[watch battery]].\n* The [[video card]] (also known as the graphics card), which processes computer graphics. More powerful graphics cards are better suited to handle strenuous tasks, such as playing intensive [[video games]] or running [[computer graphics]] software. A video card contains a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) and [[video memory]] (typically a type of [[SDRAM]]), both fabricated on [[MOS integrated circuit]] (MOS IC) chips.\n*[[Power MOSFET]]s make up the [[voltage regulator module]] (VRM), which controls how much [[voltage]] other hardware components receive.<ref name=\"tomshardware\"/>\n\n====Expansion cards====\n{{Main|Expansion card}}\n\nAn [[expansion card]] in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard or backplane to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. Expansion cards can be used to obtain or expand on features not offered by the motherboard.\n\n====Storage devices====\n{{Main|Computer data storage}}\n\nA storage device is any computing hardware and [[digital media]] that is used for storing, porting and extracting data files and objects. It can hold and store information both temporarily and permanently and can be internal or external to a computer, server or any similar computing device. Data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers.\n\n=====Fixed media=====\nData is stored by a computer using a variety of media.

Rather it indicates the fastest computations available at any given time. In mid-2011, the fastest supercomputers boasted speeds exceeding one petaflop, or 1 quadrillion (10^15 or 1,000 trillion) floating-point operations per second.\nSupercomputers are fast but extremely costly, so they are generally used by large organizations to execute computationally demanding tasks involving large data sets. Supercomputers typically run military and scientific applications. Although costly, they are also being used for commercial applications where huge amounts of data must be analyzed. For example, large banks employ supercomputers to calculate the risks and returns of various investment strategies, and healthcare organizations use them to analyze giant databases of patient data to determine optimal treatments for various diseases and problems incurring to the country.\n\n{{Expand section|[[mobile phone]], [[cloud computing]], [[embedded system]] and [[internet of things]] hardware; [[systems on chip]] more generally|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Hardware upgrade==\nWhen using computer hardware, an [[upgrade]] means adding new hardware to a computer that improves its performance, increases its capacity, or adds new features. For example, a user could perform a hardware upgrade to replace the [[hard drive]] with a faster one or an [[SSD]] to get a boost in performance. Also, the user could install more RAM so the computer may run more smoothly. The user could add a [[USB 3.0]] [[expansion card]] to fully use USB 3.0 devices, or could upgrade the [[GPU]] for extra rendering power.

It provides mechanical support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard, disk drives, and power supplies, and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components. The case is also part of the system to control electromagnetic interference radiated by the computer and protects internal parts from electrostatic discharge. Large tower cases provide extra internal space for multiple disk drives or other peripherals and usually stand on the floor, while desktop cases provide less expansion room. All-in-one style designs include a video display built into the same case. Portable and laptop computers require cases that provide impact protection for the unit.

The CPU is a [[microprocessor]], which is [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] on a [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chip. It is usually [[CPU cooling|cooled]] by a heat sink and fan, or water-cooling system. Most newer CPU includes an on-die [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). The [[clock speed]] of CPU governs how fast it executes instructions and is measured in GHz; typical values lie between 1&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz. Many modern computers have the option to overclock the CPU which enhances performance at the expense of greater thermal output and thus a need for improved cooling.\n* The [[chipset]], which includes the [[Northbridge (computing)|north bridge]], mediates communication between the CPU and the other components of the system, including main memory; as well as [[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]], which is connected to the north bridge, and supports auxiliary interfaces and buses; and, finally, a [[Super I/O]] chip, connected through the south bridge, which supports the slowest and most legacy components like [[serial port]]s, [[hardware monitoring]] and [[fan control]].\n*[[Random-access memory]] (RAM), which stores the code and data that are being actively accessed by the CPU. For example, when a web browser is opened on the computer it takes up memory; this is stored in the RAM until the web browser is closed. It is typically a type of [[dynamic RAM]] (DRAM), such as [[synchronous DRAM]] (SDRAM), where [[MOS memory]] chips store data on [[memory cell (computing)|memory cells]] consisting of MOSFETs and [[MOS capacitor]]s. RAM usually comes on [[dual in-line memory module]]s (DIMMs) in the sizes of 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB, but can be much larger.\n*[[Read-only memory]] (ROM), which stores the [[BIOS]] that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution, a process known as [[Bootstrapping (computing)|Bootstrapping]], or \"[[booting]]\" or \"booting up\". The ROM is typically a [[nonvolatile BIOS memory]] chip, which stores data on [[floating-gate MOSFET]] memory cells.\n** The [[BIOS]] (Basic Input Output System) includes boot [[firmware]] and power management firmware. Newer motherboards use [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface]] (UEFI) instead of BIOS.\n*[[Bus (computing)|Buses]] that connect the CPU to various internal components and to expand cards for graphics and sound.\n* The [[CMOS]] (complementary MOS) [[electric battery|battery]], which powers the [[CMOS memory]] for date and time in the BIOS chip. This battery is generally a [[watch battery]].\n* The [[video card]] (also known as the graphics card), which processes computer graphics. More powerful graphics cards are better suited to handle strenuous tasks, such as playing intensive [[video games]] or running [[computer graphics]] software. A video card contains a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) and [[video memory]] (typically a type of [[SDRAM]]), both fabricated on [[MOS integrated circuit]] (MOS IC) chips.\n*[[Power MOSFET]]s make up the [[voltage regulator module]] (VRM), which controls how much [[voltage]] other hardware components receive.<ref name=\"tomshardware\"/>\n\n====Expansion cards====\n{{Main|Expansion card}}\n\nAn [[expansion card]] in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard or backplane to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. Expansion cards can be used to obtain or expand on features not offered by the motherboard.\n\n====Storage devices====\n{{Main|Computer data storage}}\n\nA storage device is any computing hardware and [[digital media]] that is used for storing, porting and extracting data files and objects. It can hold and store information both temporarily and permanently and can be internal or external to a computer, server or any similar computing device. Data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers.\n\n=====Fixed media=====\nData is stored by a computer using a variety of media.

Some systems may use a [[disk array controller]] for greater performance or reliability.\n\n=====Removable media=====\nTo transfer data between computers, an external [[flash memory]] device (such as a [[memory card]] or [[USB flash drive]]) or [[optical disc]] (such as a [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD-ROM]] or [[BD-ROM]]) may be used. Their usefulness depends on being readable by other systems; the majority of machines have an [[optical disk drive]] (ODD), and virtually all have at least one [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB) port.\n\n====Input and output peripherals====\n{{Main|Peripheral}}\n\n[[Input device|Input]] and [[Output device|output]] devices are typically housed externally to the main computer chassis. The following are either standard or very common to many computer systems.\n\n=====Input device=====\n[[Input devices]] allow the user to enter information into the system, or control its operation. Most personal computers have a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] and [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], but laptop systems typically use a [[touchpad]] instead of a mouse. Other input devices include [[webcam]]s, [[microphone]]s, [[joystick]]s, and [[image scanner]]s.\n\n=====Output device=====\n[[Output device]]s are designed around the senses of human beings. For example, monitors display text that can be read, speakers produce sound that can be heard.<ref>{{cite book |title=PC hardware : a beginner's guide |date=2001 |publisher=Osborne/McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780072129908 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/pchardwarebeginn00gils/page/20 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/pchardwarebeginn00gils/page/20 }}</ref> Such devices could include [[Printer (computing)|printer]]s, [[Computer speaker|speakers]], [[Computer monitor|monitors]] or a [[Braille embosser]].\n\n===Mainframe computer===\n{{Main|Mainframe Computer}}\nA [[mainframe computer]] is a much larger computer that typically fills a room and may cost many hundreds or thousands of times as much as a personal computer.

As of June 2018, the fastest supercomputer on the [[TOP500]]<nowiki/>supercomputer list is the [[Summit (supercomputer)|Summit]], in the United States, with a [[LINPACK benchmark]]<nowiki/>score of 122.3 PFLOPS   [[Sunway TaihuLight|Light]], by around 29 PFLOPS.\n\nThe term supercomputer does not refer to a specific technology. Rather it indicates the fastest computations available at any given time. In mid-2011, the fastest supercomputers boasted speeds exceeding one petaflop, or 1 quadrillion (10^15 or 1,000 trillion) floating-point operations per second.\nSupercomputers are fast but extremely costly, so they are generally used by large organizations to execute computationally demanding tasks involving large data sets. Supercomputers typically run military and scientific applications. Although costly, they are also being used for commercial applications where huge amounts of data must be analyzed. For example, large banks employ supercomputers to calculate the risks and returns of various investment strategies, and healthcare organizations use them to analyze giant databases of patient data to determine optimal treatments for various diseases and problems incurring to the country.\n\n{{Expand section|[[mobile phone]], [[cloud computing]], [[embedded system]] and [[internet of things]] hardware; [[systems on chip]] more generally|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Hardware upgrade==\nWhen using computer hardware, an [[upgrade]] means adding new hardware to a computer that improves its performance, increases its capacity, or adds new features. For example, a user could perform a hardware upgrade to replace the [[hard drive]] with a faster one or an [[SSD]] to get a boost in performance. Also, the user could install more RAM so the computer may run more smoothly. The user could add a [[USB 3.0]] [[expansion card]] to fully use USB 3.0 devices, or could upgrade the [[GPU]] for extra rendering power. Performing such hardware upgrades may be necessary for older computers to meet a program's system requirements.\n\n==Sales==\nGlobal revenue from computer hardware in 2016 reached 408 billion Euros.<ref>{{cite web |title=Global revenue from computer hardware from 2005 to 2016 |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/268633/worldwide-revenue-from-computer-hardware-since-2005/ |website=Statista |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Recycling==\n{{main|Computer recycling}}\n{{globalize|section|USA|date=January 2020}}\nBecause computer parts contain [[hazard]]ous materials, there is a growing movement to recycle old and outdated parts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-recycle-your-old-computer/|title=How to recycle your old computer|date=2016-12-18|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417055533/http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-recycle-your-old-computer/|archivedate=17 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Computer hardware contain dangerous chemicals such as: lead, mercury, nickel, and cadmium.

The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a \"Women Course\" that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now [[Tuskegee University]]. President [[Jonathan L. Snyder]] invited its president [[Booker T.

One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction of another dormitory.

The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a \"Women Course\" that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now [[Tuskegee University]]. President [[Jonathan L. Snyder]] invited its president [[Booker T.

One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction of another dormitory.

Hist.'' (an abbreviation of the alternative title ''A General History of the Dichlamydeous Plants'') and written between 1832 and 1838. He included in his new genus the two species hitherto known as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'' L. and ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' M. Bieb. \u2013 the latter published by Baron [[Friedrich August Marschall von Bieberstein]] in his ''Flora taurico-caucasica'' of 1808.\n\n==Common names==\nNot being native to Western Europe, plants belonging to the genus ''Physochlaina'' have no common name of any antiquity in English, nor have they acquired a more recent common name among English-speaking gardeners, despite the passage of two centuries since their introduction to cultivation in the U.K.\n\n[[Robert Sweet (botanist)|Robert Sweet]] coined the English name ''Oriental Henbane'' for ''P. orientalis'' in his work ''The British Flower Garden'' in 1823, but this is simply a translation of the ( now obsolete ) name ''Hyoscyamus orientalis''. He further coins the name ''Purple-flowered Henbane'' for the Siberian species ''P. physaloides'', but this adds to the confusion, as, not only is the species in question no longer classified as a Henbane ( i.e. ''Hyoscyamus'' ) , but there are also a number of ( true ) ''Hyoscyamus'' spp. which bear purple flowers \u2013 e.g. [[Hyoscyamus muticus]].\n\nThere is, however, a common name (age unknown) for ''Physochlaina'' in [[Russian (language)|Russian]], namely \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 (''Puzeernitsa'') \u2013 '[[Pig bladder|bladder]] / [[Bubble (physics)|bubble]] plant', qualified \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0424\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f (''Puzeernitsa Phizalisovaya'') \u2013 ''Physalis-like Bladder plant'' in the case of ''P. physaloides ''.<ref>YouTube.com Physochlaina videos produced by \u0412\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 (Vokrug Sveta) TV and \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0513\u0430 (Dmitriy Sutula).</ref> The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] common name for the genus \u2013 ''V\u00e5rbolm\u00f6rt'' \u2013 translates as '[[Spring (season)|Spring]](-flowering) [[Henbane]]',<ref>Glosbe online Swedish dictionary.</ref> while the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] common name ''Kievarinyrtti'' means '[[Inn]] Herb'<ref>Google translate: Finnish to English.</ref> and the Estonian common name is ''Ida-vullrohu'', meaning 'Eastern Henbane'.<ref>Facebook page for Tartu \u00dcllikooli botaanikaaed (= [[University of Tartu Botanical Gardens]] )</ref>\n\nIn [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]], where the species ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is native to the region abutting the easternmost stretch of Turkey's [[Black Sea]] coast, the common name given to the plant is ''Ta\u015f Banotu'', meaning ''Stone Henbane'' i.e. \"the henbane that grows on/out of, stone\" in reference to the plant's ability to thrive in rock crevices [see section below on ''P. orientalis'' with accompanying image of wild specimen growing in crevices in volcanic rock].<ref>https://www.bizimbitkiler.org.tr/v2/sonuc.php?i=Vm0xMFlWbFdWWGhVYmtwUFZsWndUMVl3Vm1GV01XeHpWMjVrV2xadGVIcFhhMUpQVkcxS1NHVkdhRmhXUlRWMldWVmFXbVF4WkhOalJtUlhaV3hhVFZkV1ZtRlhiVlowVW10c1ZXSklRazlaYkZWM1RWWmFWbGRyV2xCV2EwcFRWVVpSZDFCUlBUMD0= Retrieved at 1.30am on 12/2/20</ref><ref>http://www.bizimcicekler.org.tr/gallery.php?taxonID=12831 Retrieved at 2.10am on 12/2/20</ref> The late Professor [[Turhan Baytop]] lists the Turkish common name ''Yalanc\u0131 Banotu'' (= \"False Henbane\") for the plant in his 1963 work on the medicinal and poisonous plants of Turkey.

It is thus possible that the compound ''Typpyrgerdeg'' is translateable as ''grave-grass'' i.e. a fodder plant associated in some way with grave mounds.

Flowers pedunculate (not secund, [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]]/subsessile as in [[Hyoscyamus]]). Calyx lobes subequal or unequal; [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] campanulate (bell-shaped) or infundibuliform (funnel-shaped), lobes subequal or sometimes unequal, [[Aestivation (botany)|imbricate]] in bud; stamens inserted at the middle of corolla tube; disk conspicuous; fruiting calyx lobes nonspinescent apically (i.e. lacking the spiny points characteristic of the calyces of the related genus Hyoscyamus \u2013 the Henbanes), fruiting calyx inflated, bladder-like or campanulate, loosely enclosing the capsular fruit.

' of 1838 : <blockquote>'The species of ''Physochlaina'' are extremely desirable plants; being early flowerers, and elegant when in blossom. They will grow in any soil, and are readily propagated by divisions of the root, or by seed. They are well adapted for decorating borders in early spring'.</blockquote>\n\nIn regard to the soil type favoured by wild populations, volume 22 of ''Linnaea'' (in surprisingly geological vein) provides the observation that ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is to be found growing on soils underlain by [[trachyte]]s ([[volcanic rock]]s of a type notably rich in the chemical element [[potassium]], a plant macronutrient essential for the production of flowers and fruit and, in a specifically Solanaceous context, the main ingredient of liquid feed for [[tomato]] plants).\n\n==Use in traditional Chinese medicine==\n[[File:Physochlaina infundibularis single flower.jpg|thumb|Single flower of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' Kuang \u2013 the 'hot ginseng' of [[Mount Hua]], [[Shaanxi]] province.]]\nAt least three species of ''Physochlaina'' are currently used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] : ''P. infundibularis'', ''P. physaloides'' and ''P. praealta''.\n\n=== ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' ===\n\u6f0f\u6597\u6ce1\u56ca\u8349 ''Lou-dou Pao-nang-ts'ao'' / ''lou dou pao nang cao'' (= 'Funnel-shaped ''Physochlaina'' '). The inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces of [[Shaanxi]] (rendered formerly 'Shensi') and [[Henan]] hold ''P. infundibularis'' in high esteem as a medicinal plant, regarding it as a kind of [[ginseng]] : most unusually for a toxic [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] plant (totally unrelated botanically to the [[Araliaceae|Araliaceous]] ginseng genus [[Panax]]) it is considered to be a 'general tonic' ( = [[adaptogen]]). The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use. The three drugs added to the boiling solution are the root of ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'', the [[rhizome]] of ''[[Ophiopogon japonicus]]'' and the fruits of ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]''. This peeling, boiling and addition of 'cooling', [[yin and yang|'yin']] drugs is undertaken to mitigate the 'heat' / toxicity of the ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' roots.\n\nIn addition to its use as an adaptogen, ''P. infundibularis'' is used (in traditional Chinese medicine) in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[abdominal pain]], [[palpitations]] and [[insomnia]] and as a [[sedative]].

Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.<ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels.

It was from here that Gmelin sent Krasheninnikov ahead to [[Okhotsk]] and Kamchatka to reconnoitre, make preliminary observations and prepare accommodation, and it was thus that he came to be the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the Kamchatka peninsula,<ref>Hintzsche / Nickol, Die Gro\u00dfe Nordische Expedition</ref> publishing his observations in 1755 in the work ''\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438'' (''Description of the Land of Kamchatka'') \u2013 from Chapter 14 of which the following passage is translated: \n<blockquote>...persons thus intoxicated [by ''Amanita muscaria''] have hallucinations, as if in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifying or felicitous, depending on differences in temperament, owing to which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors, while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, and a tub of water as deep as the sea.<ref>Krasheninnikov, Stepan \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 (''Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki'' - Description of the Land of Kamchatka), pub.

Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich - from an edition of 1949 edited under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo the above may readily be compared Gmelin's ''mistaking a drop of water for a mighty ocean'' and ''He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him''.\nThe phenomenon, described in similar terms by Gmelin and Krasheninnikov in their respective accounts, is that of [[macropsia]] - whereby small objects are perceived as being enormous - a symptom of (among other conditions, both natural and self-inflicted) the use of psychoactive drugs<ref>Unnithan SB, Cutting JC. The cocaine experience: Refuting the concept of a model psychosis? Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|left|18th century [[Prussia]]n botanist, zoologist and [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) ''Tchindat'' (= ''Chindanturuk'') on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), east of [[Lake Baikal]], west of [[Hulun Lake|Lake Hulun]] and straddling the border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:Operational Navigation Chart E-8, 6th edition.jpg|thumb|U.S. navigation chart covering Dauria (Transbaikalia), showing ''Chindanturuk'' under the name ''Chindant pervyy'' i.e. \"First (=oldest) Chindant\", north of salt lakes Barun-Torey and Zu(u)n-Torey on the border with Mongolia (bottom centre).]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]] (Mongolian: ''Boorj''), a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

Gauthier de la Peyronie 1793.</ref>\nAfter accepting a professorship at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] offered him by Empress [[Catherine the Great]], Pallas led an expedition lasting from 1768 to 1774, which took him from the central provinces of Russia far to the east - all the way to the lands beyond [[Lake Baikal]]. It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to ''Chindanturuk'' never leaves the river ([[Onon River|Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream ''Udagata\u00ef'', one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides''). The Tungus make use of its narcotic seed; they roast it like [[coffee]] and drink the decoction with their dinner.<ref name= \"Pallas Voyages\"/></blockquote>\nA second account (later in publication date than the ''Reisen...'' but earlier than the ''Voyages...'') of the relevant part of Pallas's expedition by an anonymous anthologist of eighteenth century travel writing provides some further details absent from the French translation and derived possibly from Pallas's original German text.\n<blockquote>The lowlands lead onward to the outpost of Udagatai, and, farther yet to Chindanturuk, where one sees growing in abundance, beneath the nettles which grow beside the rocks, ''Hyosciamus physalodes'' [sic], a rare plant, the intoxicating seed (which ripens toward the end of July) of which the Tungus roast thoroughly in a frying pan, as one roasts coffee, and boil to make a beverage which they drink with their dinner.<ref>[Author anonymous] ''Histoire des Decouvertes faites par divers savans voyageurs dans plusieurs contr\u00e9es de la Russie & de la Perse, relativement \u00e0 l'Histoire civile & naturelle \u00e0 l'\u00c9conomie rurale, au commerce &c''. pub. Aberne, chez Fran\u00e7ois Seizer et Comp., 1787.</ref></blockquote>\nThe question naturally arises as to which Tungusic people (or peoples) it was that Pallas encountered in Dauria. The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref>Winston, Robert, ed. (2004). Human: The Definitive Visual Guide. New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests almost a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently during a meal.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.,<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref> page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''. Welter and Hartwich mention, respectively, in this context \"a species of ''henbane''\" and \"Hyoscyamus sp.\"\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Physochlaina'' species have yielded a variety of [[tropane alkaloids]], including not only the [[hyoscyamine]] and [[hyoscine|scopolamine]] present also in better-known Solanaceous genera such as [[Atropa]], [[Hyoscyamus]] and [[Scopolia]], but also the new ([[eponymous]]) base physochlaine, first isolated from the aerial parts of the Central Asian species ''Physochlaina alaica'' Korotkova ex Kovalevsk.<ref>Mirzamatov R., Luftullin K., Mallikov V. and Yunusov, S.

According to her account, the plant is endemic to the Alay and [[Turkestan Range|Turkestan mountains]] of the [[Fergana Region]] (see also [[Fergana Valley]]). In this context she also mentions the Alay Ridge and the basins of the Shohimardon and [[Sokh River|Sokh]] rivers. [Note: there is no page \"Shohimardon River\" on either English or Uzbek Wikipedias, but see page [[Shohimardon]] (village)]. In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia]]n ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia. The Urmia University Department of Medicinal Plants, in describing the therapeutic properties of the plant said: \"This plant is a sedative, nerve stimulant, analgesic, poison and hallucinogen\".</blockquote>\n\nTransliterations of place names in the various languages of Iran from the original [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] forms into Latin script can often yield a confusing number of variant spellings - as is apparent in the variant forms ''Khoi'' and ''Khoy'' and the still more divergent ''Dalampur'', ''Dalampir'' and \n(with a variant medial consonant as well as vowel) ''Dalanpar'' ''Dalanper'' etc.\n''Khoy'' / ''Khoi'' University likely refers to the Khoy campus of Urmia University, while the Heights of ''Dalampur'' (etc.) appears to designate an area of natural beauty and Iranian domestic  tourism encompassing a peak (37\u00b09\u2032N 44\u00b047\u2032E) which forms the [[tripoint]] of Iran, [[Iraq]] and Turkey, lying some 50km from the city of [[Urmia]].<ref>\u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u064a \u062f\u0648 \u06af\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u064a (Translation: ''Detection of Medicinal Properties of Two Plants at Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoi'') - article in  I.S.N.A. web archive dated Monday September 21, 2014 1.50pm.

[[Leiden University|Leyden University]] 1775 by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] - who also engraved the coloured plates.]]\nAn early botanical illustration - possibly the first such to be made - of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' is that engraved by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] (then ''hortulanus'' (director) of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]]) for his work of 1775 ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants').\nThe drawing rendered in the engraving is a depiction of a living specimen created when the plant was in flower in the Spring - a realistic portrayal of an outlying portion of an established clump of the plant, uprooted when in full growth for the purposes of illustration, rather than during the more appropriate period (for propagation by division) of the plant's Summer dormancy.\nClearly visible are the tuberous rootstock, with attached roots, and three attached dead stems (two still bearing withered scale leaves) from the previous season's aerial growth. [See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB. V.\nHYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) foliis ovatis integerrimis,\ncalycibus inflatis subglobosis Linn. Sp. pl. p. 258</blockquote>\n\n- text incorporating the description in [[Species Plantarum]] and deriving from volume one of Linnaeus's earlier work [[Hortus Upsaliensis]] of 1748,in which a binomial was assigned the plant discovered by Gmelin [see section above].\nAll the above noted, because of the time of year at which the Leiden specimen was drawn, no ripe fruiting calyces were available for depiction. Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (ten days) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (eleven days) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (twelve days) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (thirteen days) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.

' of 1838 : <blockquote>'The species of ''Physochlaina'' are extremely desirable plants; being early flowerers, and elegant when in blossom. They will grow in any soil, and are readily propagated by divisions of the root, or by seed. They are well adapted for decorating borders in early spring'.</blockquote>\n\nIn regard to the soil type favoured by wild populations, volume 22 of ''Linnaea'' (in surprisingly geological vein) provides the observation that ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is to be found growing on soils underlain by [[trachyte]]s ([[volcanic rock]]s of a type notably rich in the chemical element [[potassium]], a plant macronutrient essential for the production of flowers and fruit and, in a specifically Solanaceous context, the main ingredient of liquid feed for [[tomato]] plants).\n\n==Use in traditional Chinese medicine==\n[[File:Physochlaina infundibularis single flower.jpg|thumb|Single flower of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' Kuang \u2013 the 'hot ginseng' of [[Mount Hua]], [[Shaanxi]] province.]]\nAt least three species of ''Physochlaina'' are currently used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] : ''P. infundibularis'', ''P. physaloides'' and ''P. praealta''.\n\n=== ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' ===\n\u6f0f\u6597\u6ce1\u56ca\u8349 ''Lou-dou Pao-nang-ts'ao'' / ''lou dou pao nang cao'' (= 'Funnel-shaped ''Physochlaina'' '). The inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces of [[Shaanxi]] (rendered formerly 'Shensi') and [[Henan]] hold ''P. infundibularis'' in high esteem as a medicinal plant, regarding it as a kind of [[ginseng]] : most unusually for a toxic [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] plant (totally unrelated botanically to the [[Araliaceae|Araliaceous]] ginseng genus [[Panax]]) it is considered to be a 'general tonic' ( = [[adaptogen]]). The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use. The three drugs added to the boiling solution are the root of ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'', the [[rhizome]] of ''[[Ophiopogon japonicus]]'' and the fruits of ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]''. This peeling, boiling and addition of 'cooling', [[yin and yang|'yin']] drugs is undertaken to mitigate the 'heat' / toxicity of the ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' roots.\n\nIn addition to its use as an adaptogen, ''P. infundibularis'' is used (in traditional Chinese medicine) in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[abdominal pain]], [[palpitations]] and [[insomnia]] and as a [[sedative]]. The drug is also used to treat [[diarrhea]] of the kind considered in traditional Chinese medicine to be 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold'.<ref>Peigen, Xiao and Liyi, He ''Ethnopharmacologic investigation on tropane-containing drugs in Chinese Solanaceous plants'' in ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' Volume 8 No. 1 July (1983) pub.

Furthermore, at the foot of the West Peak of Mount Hua (known as Lianhua Feng (\u84ee\u82b1\u5cf0) or Furong Feng (\u8299\u84c9\u5cf0), both meaning [[Lotus Flower]] Summit) stood, from as early as the second century BCE, a [[Taoist temple]] which was the site of [[Shamanism|shamanic]] practices undertaken by [[Tongji (spirit medium)|spirit mediums]] (see also [[Wu (shaman)]]) to contact an (unnamed) God of the [[Diyu|Underworld]] and his minions, believed to dwell in the heart of the mountain.(See also [[Chinese folk religion]]).<ref>Goossaert, Vincent. \"Huashan.\" in Fabrizio Pregadio, ed., The Encyclopedia of Taoism (London: Routledge, 2008), 481\u2013482.</ref> Tropane-containing, Solanaceous plants (such as ''[[Datura]]'' and ''[[Hyoscyamus]]'' spp.) have a long history of use as entheogens in shamanic practices<ref>Harner, Michael J., ''Hallucinogens and Shamanism'', pub.

When they had returned to their senses, they named these falls The Drunken Rapids and, because one suffers a [[headache]] after such a [[Binge drinking|debauch]], they named the falls that they encountered next Pokhmelnoy Porog [ Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 : The [[Hangover|Hungover]] Rapids ].</Blockquote>\nHis curiosity aroused, Gmelin investigated, and discovered an attractive new species :\n<Blockquote>This account has given me the opportunity to reveal the identity of the beautiful plant involved, which was unknown to any botanist before me : '' Hyoscyamus foliis integerrimis calicibus inflatis subglobosis '' [Botanical Latin : 'The Henbane having simple, untoothed leaves and (fruiting ) calyces that are more or less round and inflated' [ i.e. like those of a [[Physalis]] ]] Linn. h. Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.<ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels. After many adventures, including the encounter with ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on the Angara river near [[Yeniseysk]], Professors Gmelin and [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], student Krasheninnikov and many other expedition members gathered at [[Vitus Bering]]'s base at [[Yakutsk]]. It was from here that Gmelin sent Krasheninnikov ahead to [[Okhotsk]] and Kamchatka to reconnoitre, make preliminary observations and prepare accommodation, and it was thus that he came to be the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the Kamchatka peninsula,<ref>Hintzsche / Nickol, Die Gro\u00dfe Nordische Expedition</ref> publishing his observations in 1755 in the work ''\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438'' (''Description of the Land of Kamchatka'') \u2013 from Chapter 14 of which the following passage is translated: \n<blockquote>...persons thus intoxicated [by ''Amanita muscaria''] have hallucinations, as if in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifying or felicitous, depending on differences in temperament, owing to which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors, while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, and a tub of water as deep as the sea.<ref>Krasheninnikov, Stepan \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 (''Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki'' - Description of the Land of Kamchatka), pub.

Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich - from an edition of 1949 edited under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo the above may readily be compared Gmelin's ''mistaking a drop of water for a mighty ocean'' and ''He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him''.\nThe phenomenon, described in similar terms by Gmelin and Krasheninnikov in their respective accounts, is that of [[macropsia]] - whereby small objects are perceived as being enormous - a symptom of (among other conditions, both natural and self-inflicted) the use of psychoactive drugs<ref>Unnithan SB, Cutting JC. The cocaine experience: Refuting the concept of a model psychosis? Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|left|18th century [[Prussia]]n botanist, zoologist and [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) ''Tchindat'' (= ''Chindanturuk'') on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), east of [[Lake Baikal]], west of [[Hulun Lake|Lake Hulun]] and straddling the border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:Operational Navigation Chart E-8, 6th edition.jpg|thumb|U.S. navigation chart covering Dauria (Transbaikalia), showing ''Chindanturuk'' under the name ''Chindant pervyy'' i.e. \"First (=oldest) Chindant\", north of salt lakes Barun-Torey and Zu(u)n-Torey on the border with Mongolia (bottom centre).]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]] (Mongolian: ''Boorj''), a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

Gauthier de la Peyronie 1793.</ref>\nAfter accepting a professorship at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] offered him by Empress [[Catherine the Great]], Pallas led an expedition lasting from 1768 to 1774, which took him from the central provinces of Russia far to the east - all the way to the lands beyond [[Lake Baikal]]. It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to ''Chindanturuk'' never leaves the river ([[Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream ''Udagata\u00ef'', one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides''). The Tungus make use of its narcotic seed; they roast it like [[coffee]] and drink the decoction with their dinner.<ref name= \"Pallas Voyages\"/></blockquote>\nA second account (later in publication date than the ''Reisen...'' but earlier than the ''Voyages...'') of the relevant part of Pallas's expedition by an anonymous anthologist of eighteenth century travel writing provides some further details absent from the French translation and derived possibly from Pallas's original German text.\n<blockquote>The lowlands lead onward to the outpost of Udagatai, and, farther yet to Chindanturuk, where one sees growing in abundance, beneath the nettles which grow beside the rocks, ''Hyosciamus physalodes'' [sic], a rare plant, the intoxicating seed (which ripens toward the end of July) of which the Tungus roast thoroughly in a frying pan, as one roasts coffee, and boil to make a beverage which they drink with their dinner.<ref>[Author anonymous] ''Histoire des Decouvertes faites par divers savans voyageurs dans plusieurs contr\u00e9es de la Russie & de la Perse, relativement \u00e0 l'Histoire civile & naturelle \u00e0 l'\u00c9conomie rurale, au commerce &c''. pub. Aberne, chez Fran\u00e7ois Seizer et Comp., 1787.</ref></blockquote>\nThe question naturally arises as to which Tungusic people (or peoples) it was that Pallas encountered in Dauria. The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref>Winston, Robert, ed. (2004). Human: The Definitive Visual Guide. New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests almost a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently during a meal. Entheogens, as their name suggests, are generally used in a ritual or religious setting,<ref>Furst, Peter T. ''Hallucinogens and Culture'' pub.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.,<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref> page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''. Welter and Hartwich mention, respectively, in this context \"a species of ''henbane''\" and \"Hyoscyamus sp.\"\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Physochlaina'' species have yielded a variety of [[tropane alkaloids]], including not only the [[hyoscyamine]] and [[hyoscine|scopolamine]] present also in better-known Solanaceous genera such as [[Atropa]], [[Hyoscyamus]] and [[Scopolia]], but also the new ([[eponymous]]) base physochlaine, first isolated from the aerial parts of the Central Asian species ''Physochlaina alaica'' Korotkova ex Kovalevsk.<ref>Mirzamatov R., Luftullin K., Mallikov V. and Yunusov, S.

( Compare also a similar penchant for growing in rock crevices on the part of the Xinjiang species ''Physochlaina capitata'' \u2013 see above ).\n\nThe plant's country of origin is given in von Bieberstein's original description of ' ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' ' (now ''Physochlaina orientalis'') as Caucasian [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]  \u2013 a former kingdom, the heartland of which is the modern [[Georgia (Caucasus)|Georgian]] province of [[Kartli]]. The Caucasian Kingdom of Iberia also encompassed parts of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], southern [[Russia]] and eastern Turkey.\n\n[[Flora Iranica]] is in agreement on this range of occurrence for ''P. orientalis'', adding also to the list of territories not only north-western Iran but also 'Syr Darja' \u2013 the latter being referable to lands traversed by the river [[Syr Darya]] and, more especially the historic [[Syr-Darya Oblast]] and hence modern [[Uzbekistan]]. Uzbekistan lies outside the area encompassed by Flora Iranica, but parts of neighbouring [[Turkmenistan]] do not. Either way, Flora Iranica is unequivocal in describing the range of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' as extending eastward into [[Central Asia]].\n\n===Physochlaina alaica - an endangered medicinal plant of Central Asia===\nIn this context, it may be noted that Phillips and Rix include in their work on garden perennials a photograph of a second, (not universally accepted) ''Physochlaina'' species of unequivocally Central Asian provenance, namely ''P. alaica'' Korotk. ex Kovalevsk, recorded as growing in the [[Pamir-Alay]], a Central Asian mountain range taking in parts not only of Uzbekistan, but also of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. ''Physochlaina alaica'' differs from ''P. orientalis'' in having flowers of a beige or yellowish-buff colour and corolla 'throats' veined within in a contrasting dark brown. As is to be expected of a plant native to the [[Pamirs]], this species is extremely hardy, if grown in dry (i.e. well-drained) conditions.<ref name= \"Perennials 1991\"/> Its common name in the [[Uzbek language]] is ''Oloy xiyoli'',\nof which the first word ''Oloy'' signifies (like the Latin specific name ''alaica'') \"of the Alay mountains\" while the second element ''xiyoli'' appears to bear some relation to the Arabic loan-word ''xiyol'' [pronounced \"khiyol\"] translatable possibly in this context as \"short-lived\" - in reference to the plant's short growing season and quick flowering as a desert ephemeral, fuelled by food reserves stored in its fleshy roots.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\">Mamatqulova (Yuldasheva), Gulzira, (2016), ''Ekologik Omillarni O'zbekiston Hududida Tarqalgan Noyob O'simliklarga Ta'siri va Ularni Muhofaza Qilish'' (Translation: \"The Impact of Ecological Factors upon some Unique Plants found within the Territory of [[Uzbekistan]] and Measures Needed for their Protection\"), paper submitted for the degree of BSc, Dept. of Biology and Ecology in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, [[Andijan State University]], Republic of Uzbekistan.

According to her account, the plant is endemic to the Alay and [[Turkestan Range|Turkestan mountains]] of the [[Fergana Region]] (see also [[Fergana Valley]]). In this context she also mentions the Alay Ridge and the basins of the Shohimardon and [[Sokh River|Sokh]] rivers. [Note: there is no page \"Shohimardon River\" on either English or Uzbek Wikipedias, but see page [[Shohimardon]] (village)]. In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia]]n ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia. The Urmia University Department of Medicinal Plants, in describing the therapeutic properties of the plant said: \"This plant is a sedative, nerve stimulant, analgesic, poison and hallucinogen\".</blockquote>\n\nTransliterations of place names in the various languages of Iran from the original [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] forms into Latin script can often yield a confusing number of variant spellings - as is apparent in the variant forms ''Khoi'' and ''Khoy'' and the still more divergent ''Dalampur'', ''Dalampir'' and \n(with a variant medial consonant as well as vowel) ''Dalanpar'' ''Dalanper'' etc.\n''Khoy'' / ''Khoi'' University likely refers to the Khoy campus of Urmia University, while the Heights of ''Dalampur'' (etc.) appears to designate an area of natural beauty and Iranian domestic  tourism encompassing a peak (37\u00b09\u2032N 44\u00b047\u2032E) which forms the [[tripoint]] of Iran, [[Iraq]] and Turkey, lying some 50km from the city of [[Urmia]].<ref>\u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u064a \u062f\u0648 \u06af\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u064a (Translation: ''Detection of Medicinal Properties of Two Plants at Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoi'') - article in  I.S.N.A. web archive dated Monday September 21, 2014 1.50pm.

[[Leiden University|Leyden University]] 1775 by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] - who also engraved the coloured plates.]]\nAn early botanical illustration - possibly the first such to be made - of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' is that engraved by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] (then ''hortulanus'' (director) of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]]) for his work of 1775 ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants').\nThe drawing rendered in the engraving is a depiction of a living specimen created when the plant was in flower in the Spring - a realistic portrayal of an outlying portion of an established clump of the plant, uprooted when in full growth for the purposes of illustration, rather than during the more appropriate period (for propagation by division) of the plant's Summer dormancy.\nClearly visible are the tuberous rootstock, with attached roots, and three attached dead stems (two still bearing withered scale leaves) from the previous season's aerial growth. [See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB.

Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (ten days) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (eleven days) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (twelve days) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (thirteen days) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.
