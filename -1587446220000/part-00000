Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].\n\nThe first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (released soon after). The film's cast remained active in the Indonesian film industry, some for another thirty years, and SPFC produced six more works before closing in 1949. A copy of the film is stored at [[Sinematek Indonesia]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Ratna Asmara, Ali Yugo, and Iscandar Sukarno in Djaoeh di Mata, Peran Pemuda dalam Kebangkitan Film Indonesia, p50.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Ratna Asmara, Ali Joego, and Iscandar Sukarno in a scene from the film]]\nA poor villager, Asrad ([[Ali Joego]]), is blinded following a traffic accident and thus unable to work. As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385\u2013387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.

Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].\n\nThe first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (released soon after).

As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her not to return. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385\u2013387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.

Several frameworks for building contact tracing apps have been developed. Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users. \n\nLess intrusive alternatives include the use of [[Bluetooth]] signals to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.

Jonsson was, for a time, bassist in the Shitlickers, another early Swedish d-beat band. After rehearsing for a while, they released their first 7\" EP ''Anarkist Attack''.<ref name=jandreus/> In 1982 they kicked out Nillen. Jonsson took over the vocals part, and Conrad took over the bass playing. The next 7\" EP, called ''Raped Ass'', was released in 1983.<ref name=jandreus/> This work is considered one of the most severe in the history of hardcore.<ref name=\"ekeroth\"/> In 1984 they released another 7\" EP, ''Victims Of A Bomb Raid''.<ref name=jandreus/> In 1986 they released a mini-Lp (12\") called ''Criminal Trap''. (This 12\" is also included as a bonus on the ''Absolut Country of Sweden'' CD). At this time Jocke had got tired of the band and they asked Cliff if he wanted to join the band but he said no, and the rest of the band members got tired of the problems and it resulted in the band splitting up. \n\nIn 1990 they decided to start the band again after Cliff had agreed to join, and they say that it's thanks to him that they regrouped. They released the comeback album ''Absolut Country Of Sweden'' the same year. In 1993 they released a raw live album ''Made In Sweden''. The show was also shot on video but never released. They later released a new live 7\" single ''Fucked In Finland'' and later on they released the album ''Scandinavian Jawbreaker''. After the release of this album the band split up and the members started in other bands such as [[Driller Killer (band)|Driller Killer]] (Cliff),<ref name=jandreus/> and [[Wolfbrigade|Wolfpack]] (Jonsson).<ref name=jandreus/>\n\nIn 2005 Dead City records released the ''A Tribute To Anti-Cimex'' LP, featuring a line-up of [[D-beat]] and [[Crust punk|Crust]] bands from all over the world that were influenced by Anti-Cimex. Notable bands include [[Disclose]] (Japan), Wolfbrigade (Sweden), [[Ratos de Por\u00e3o]] (Brazil), [[Doom (UK band)|Doom]] (UK), and many more.\n\n==Members==\n===Final line-up===\n*Tomas \"Freke\" Jonsson - bass <small>(1981)</small>, vocals <small>(1982-1993)</small> ''(Other bands: [[Wolfbrigade|Wolfpack]], Moment Maniacs, Shitlickers)''\n*Cliff Lundberg - guitar <small>(1990-1993)</small> ''(Other bands: [[Driller Killer (band)|Driller Killer]], Perukers, Moderat Likvidation, Black Uniforms)''\n*Robert \"Lefty\" J\u00f6rgensen - bass <small>(1991-1993;

Scene historian Peter Jandreus describes the group as the most famous Swedish punk band of the 1977\u201387 era.<ref name=jandreus/>\n\nTheir name is taken from the Swedish pest control company with the same name,<ref name=jandreus/> the name of this company, in turn, comes from the Latin name of a particular type of [[Bed bug (insect)|bedbug]]; ''Cimex''.<ref name=ekeroth>Daniel Ekeroth. ''Swedish Death Metal'' Kagra. Pozna\u0144. 2008. p.29. (in Polish)</ref>\n\n==History==\nFormed in 1981, the original line-up was: Jonsson - Bass, Nillen - Vocals, Charlie - Drums, Jocke - Guitar. Jonsson was, for a time, bassist in the Shitlickers, another early Swedish d-beat band. After rehearsing for a while, they released their first 7\" EP ''Anarkist Attack''.<ref name=jandreus/> In 1982 they kicked out Nillen. Jonsson took over the vocals part, and Conrad took over the bass playing. The next 7\" EP, called ''Raped Ass'', was released in 1983.<ref name=jandreus/> This work is considered one of the most severe in the history of hardcore.<ref name=\"ekeroth\"/> In 1984 they released another 7\" EP, ''Victims Of A Bomb Raid''.<ref name=jandreus/> In 1986 they released a mini-Lp (12\") called ''Criminal Trap''. (This 12\" is also included as a bonus on the ''Absolut Country of Sweden'' CD). At this time Jocke had got tired of the band and they asked Cliff if he wanted to join the band but he said no, and the rest of the band members got tired of the problems and it resulted in the band splitting up. \n\nIn 1990 they decided to start the band again after Cliff had agreed to join, and they say that it's thanks to him that they regrouped. They released the comeback album ''Absolut Country Of Sweden'' the same year. In 1993 they released a raw live album ''Made In Sweden''. The show was also shot on video but never released. They later released a new live 7\" single ''Fucked In Finland'' and later on they released the album ''Scandinavian Jawbreaker''. After the release of this album the band split up and the members started in other bands such as [[Driller Killer (band)|Driller Killer]] (Cliff),<ref name=jandreus/> and [[Wolfbrigade|Wolfpack]] (Jonsson).<ref name=jandreus/>\n\nIn 2005 Dead City records released the ''A Tribute To Anti-Cimex'' LP, featuring a line-up of [[D-beat]] and [[Crust punk|Crust]] bands from all over the world that were influenced by Anti-Cimex. Notable bands include [[Disclose]] (Japan), Wolfbrigade (Sweden), [[Ratos de Por\u00e3o]] (Brazil), [[Doom (UK band)|Doom]] (UK), and many more.\n\n==Members==\n===Final line-up===\n*Tomas \"Freke\" Jonsson - bass <small>(1981)</small>, vocals <small>(1982-1993)</small> ''(Other bands: [[Wolfbrigade|Wolfpack]], Moment Maniacs, Shitlickers)''\n*Cliff Lundberg - guitar <small>(1990-1993)</small> ''(Other bands: [[Driller Killer (band)|Driller Killer]], Perukers, Moderat Likvidation, Black Uniforms)''\n*Robert \"Lefty\" J\u00f6rgensen - bass <small>(1991-1993;

After playing [[college basketball]] for [[Duke University]], Hill played for four teams in his professional career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA): The [[Detroit Pistons]], the [[Orlando Magic]], the [[Phoenix Suns]], and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. For most of his career, he played the small forward position. Hill also co-hosts ''[[NBA Inside Stuff]]'' on [[NBA TV]].\n\nHill played basketball at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke University]] for four years. He was the 1994 [[Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|ACC Player of the Year]], a two-time [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American]], and a two-time [[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions|NCAA champion]]. Hill was touted as one of the best players in Duke history and as one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.\n\nAfter graduating from Duke in 1994, Hill was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] with the third overall pick in the [[1994 NBA draft|NBA draft]]. He was the co-winner of the 1995 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Early in his NBA career, Hill was widely considered to be one of the best all-around players in the game, often leading his team in points, [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and [[assist (basketball)|assists]]. In his first six seasons in the NBA, Hill averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game and made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team five times. However, the trajectory of his career was altered by a 2000 ankle injury. The injury continued to plague him for several years, led to a March 2003 surgery that was followed by life-threatening complications, and forced him to miss the entire 2003\u201304 season. In 2005, Hill made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team as a member of the Magic. He played in the Western Conference Finals in 2010 during his tenure with the Phoenix Suns. In the 12 seasons following his ankle injury, Hill averaged 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On June 1, 2013, Hill announced his retirement from the NBA. He is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]], a five-time [[All-NBA]] selection, and a three-time winner of the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]]. In 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nAn ownership group including Hill and [[Tony Ressler]] purchased the [[Atlanta Hawks]] on June 24, 2015.\n\n==College basketball career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen the time came to choose a college, Hill's mother told the [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] documentary ''[[Beyond the Glory]]'', that she wanted him to attend [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], while his father preferred the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]]. Hill decided to attend [[Duke University]], playing four years with the [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Blue Devils]] and winning national titles in [[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991]] and [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]]. Duke became the first Division I program to win consecutive titles since [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in [[1973 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1973]]. Despite losing two of the biggest contributors on the Blue Devils, [[Christian Laettner]] (in 1992) and [[Bobby Hurley]] (each of whom went on to play in the NBA), Hill led Duke to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|championship game]] once again in [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1994]], but lost to [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] [[1993\u201394 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team|Razorbacks]]. Hill won the [[Henry Iba Corinthian Award]] as the nation's top defensive player in 1993, and in 1994 he was the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Player of the Year. During his collegiate career, Hill became the first player in ACC history to collect more than 1,900 points, 700 rebounds, 400 assists, 200 steals and 100 blocked shots. As a result of his successful college career, he became the eighth player in Duke history to have his jersey number (33) retired. After his freshman season at Duke, Hill played on the bronze medal-winning U.S. team at the [[1991 Pan American Games]], held in [[Havana]], Cuba.\n\nHill also is widely known for his role in a desperation play in an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] regional final against [[1991\u201392 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in 1992, which is considered by many to be [[The Shot (Duke\u2013Kentucky)|one of the greatest college basketball games of all time]]. With Duke down 103\u2013102 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] and 2.1 seconds remaining after Kentucky's [[Sean Woods]] hit a floater, an unguarded Hill heaved the in-bounds pass 75 feet across the court into the hands of Laettner, who dribbled once and spun before pulling up to make the game-winning jumper from just outside the free-throw line as time expired.\n\nTouted as one of the best players in Duke history, many went as far as to say that Hill was one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.<ref>Brodess, Doug (October 24, 2011).

In addition, he became the first rookie in any of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports leagues]] to lead all-star fan voting.\n\nIn his second season ([[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]]), he once again led the All-Star fan balloting, this time edging [[Michael Jordan]] (Jordan's first All-Star game after returning since retiring in 1993). During the 1995\u201396 season, Hill showcased his all-round abilities by leading the NBA in [[triple-double]]s (10). He also won a [[gold medal]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]] as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team#1996 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team|U.S. men's basketball team]], where he had the team's fifth highest scoring average (9.7) and led the team in steals (18). In [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], Hill averaged 21.4 points, 9.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. He became the first player since [[Larry Bird]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] to average 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists in a season, an accomplishment that had not been duplicated until [[Russell Westbrook]] averaged a triple-double in the [[2016-17 NBA season]]. Once again, Hill led the league in triple-doubles, where his 13 triple-doubles represented 35 percent of the league's triple-double total that season. He was the league's Player of the Month for January and was also awarded NBA's [[IBM Award]], given to the player with the biggest statistical contributions to his team. He finished third in [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting, behind [[Karl Malone]] and Michael Jordan.\n\nMuch like [[Scottie Pippen]] with the [[Chicago Bulls|Bulls]], Hill assumed the role of a \"[[point forward]]\" in Detroit, running the Pistons' offense. As a result, between the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]] and [[1998\u201399 NBA season]]s, Hill was the league leader in assists per game among non-guards all four seasons. In the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|lockout-shortened 1999 season]], as he led his team in points, rebounds and assists for the third time, Hill joined [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Elgin Baylor]] as the only players in NBA history to lead their teams in scoring, rebounding and assists more than once. Hill and Chamberlain are the only two players in league history to lead their teams in points, rebounds and assists per game three times. Hill was selected to play in the [[1998 FIBA World Championship]], but in the end no NBA players played in this tournament due to the [[lockout (industry)|lockout]].\n\nIn [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], Hill averaged 25.8 points while shooting 49% from the field, the season's third highest scoring average, behind MVP [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Allen Iverson]]. He averaged 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game. However, despite Hill's individual accomplishments in Detroit, the Pistons never made it far in the playoffs, either losing in the first round ([[1996 NBA Playoffs|1996]], [[1997 NBA Playoffs|1997]] and [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]]), or missing the playoffs entirely in the 1994\u201395 and [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 seasons]]. The [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000 playoffs]] would be no different. On April 15, 2000, 7 days before the start of the playoffs, Hill sprained his left ankle in a game against the [[1999\u20132000 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]. He continued to play until the first round playoff series against the [[1999\u20132000 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], in which his injured ankle got worse and Hill was forced to leave halfway through game 2. Eventually, the Heat swept the Pistons 3\u20130. Hill was initially selected for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] U.S. team, but could not play due to the ankle injury. That ankle injury would prove to be a major liability for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/17/grant-hill-on-wfan-ankle-nightmare-would-have-been-avoided-with-knicks/|title=Grant Hill: Ankle Nightmare Would Have Been Avoided With Knicks|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the first six seasons of his career, before ankle injury, Hill had amassed a total of 9,393 points, 3,417 rebounds and 2,720 assists. [[Oscar Robertson]], Bird, and [[LeBron James]] are the only three players in league history to eclipse these numbers after their first six seasons.\n\n===Orlando Magic (2000\u20132007)===\nAs an unrestricted free agent, Hill had planned to sign with the [[2000\u201301 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]]. On August 3, 2000, however, a sign-and-trade deal allowed Hill to receive a slightly more lucrative contract while Detroit received at least some compensation for losing him. The Pistons signed Hill to a seven-year, $92.8 million contract and traded him to Orlando for [[Chucky Atkins]] and [[Ben Wallace]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Magic's Strength No Illusion|date = August 3, 2000|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/magics-strength-no-illusion/|work = CBS News|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}</ref> The Magic hoped he would team up with budding superstar [[Tracy McGrady]], who had been signed away from the [[Toronto Raptors]] at that time, to return Orlando among the NBA elite. But Hill was hampered by ankle injuries, playing in only four games in his [[2000\u201301 NBA season|first]] season with the Magic, 14 games in his [[2001\u201302 NBA season|second]] and 29 in his [[2002\u201303 NBA season|third]]. He was forced to sit out his ''entire'' fourth year with Orlando ([[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]]). Meanwhile, the Pistons, who had defeated the Magic in the [[2003 NBA Playoffs|2003 Playoffs]], but ended up losing to the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference Finals, won the championship the following year in [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2004]].\n\nGrant was only a Yes man.

Grant also drank glutton free soda which allowed him to be 15ft tall.  \n\nIn March 2003, Hill underwent a major surgical procedure in which doctors re-fractured his ankle and realigned it with his leg bone. Five days after the surgery was performed, Hill developed a 104.5&nbsp;\u00b0F (40.3&nbsp;\u00b0C) [[fever]] and [[convulsion]]s, and was rushed to a hospital. Doctors removed the splint around his ankle and discovered that Hill had contracted a potentially fatal [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) infection. He was hospitalized for a week and had to take [[intravenous]] [[antibiotics]] for six months.\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] Hill, though hampered by a bruised left shin that caused him to miss several games, started and played 67 games for the Magic. He was named the Eastern Conference player of the week for the week between November 15\u201321, 2004. Over the season, Hill averaged 19.7 points per game on a .509 field goal percentage. Fans voted him an All-Star starter again, and he led the Eastern Conference All-Star Team to a victory over the West. In addition, at the conclusion of the season, Hill was awarded the [[Joe Dumars Trophy]] presented to the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]] Winner.\n\nDuring the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] Hill was once again injured frequently as nagging groin injuries kept him sidelined for much of the first half of the season, limiting him to 21 games. He got a sports [[hernia]] that was caused by an uneven pressure on Hill's feet while he was running, due to concerns that he could re-aggravate the injury on his left ankle if it got too much pressure. Hill underwent surgery for the hernia and stated that he would consider retirement if he had to get another surgery.\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]] Hill returned from injuries despite numerous rumors surrounding his retirement. Hill received ankle rotation therapy from specialists in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] during the off-season and stated that he had regained much motion in his left ankle. Hill returned to the Magic lineup, starting at the [[shooting guard]] position. Despite having problems with injuries to his left knee and a [[tendon]] in his left ankle, Hill managed to play 65 games, two short of the highest number of games he played over a single season as a member of the Magic. He finished the season with averages of 14.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. This season would see Hill return to the playoffs for the first time since 2000, his first playoff appearance with the Magic. The 8th seed Magic would meet Hill's old team, the [[2006\u201307 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], in the first round. The Pistons' vast playoff experience would prevail over the inexperienced Magic, who had not seen significant post-season action for some years, and despite having some close games, the series would end with a 4\u20130 Pistons sweep, leaving Hill undecided on whether to return for the [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2007\u201308 season]] with the Magic, sign with another team, or retire.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2852728 Beset by injuries in career, Hill considers retirement], updated April 28, 2007</ref>\n\n===Phoenix Suns (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Grant Hill Phoenix.jpg|thumb|right|Hill with the Phoenix Suns in 2009]]\nHill became an [[unrestricted free agent]] on July 1, 2007.

Hill adapted well to the Suns' up-tempo style, averaging double figures in points as a key role player for Phoenix in the early months of the 2007\u201308 season. He played in the team's first 34 games before an emergency appendectomy on January 9, 2008, sidelined him for two weeks. Despite being bothered by multiple injuries throughout the season, Hill had his first 70-game season since leaving Detroit, averaging 13.1 ppg, 5.0 rpg and 2.9 apg in the process.\n\nPlaying for the Phoenix Suns in the 2008\u20132009 season, Hill appeared in all 82 games for the first time in his career and averaged 12.0 ppg, 4.90 rpg, and 2.3 apg, scoring 27 points and 10 rebounds in the Suns' season finale.\n\nOn July 10, 2009, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Hill decided to re-sign with the Phoenix Suns for a 2-year deal, despite an offer from the [[2009\u201310 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] for the full mid-level exception and the [[2009\u201310 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] offering Hill the bi-annual exception.<ref>Aldridge, David.

After playing [[college basketball]] for [[Duke University]], Hill played for four teams in his professional career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA): The [[Detroit Pistons]], the [[Orlando Magic]], the [[Phoenix Suns]], and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. For most of his career, he played the small forward position. Hill also co-hosts ''[[NBA Inside Stuff]]'' on [[NBA TV]].\n\nHill played basketball at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke University]] for four years. He was the 1994 [[Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|ACC Player of the Year]], a two-time [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American]], and a two-time [[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions|NCAA champion]]. Hill was touted as one of the best players in Duke history and as one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.\n\nAfter graduating from Duke in 1994, Hill was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] with the third overall pick in the [[1994 NBA draft|NBA draft]]. He was the co-winner of the 1995 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Early in his NBA career, Hill was widely considered to be one of the best all-around players in the game, often leading his team in points, [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and [[assist (basketball)|assists]]. In his first six seasons in the NBA, Hill averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game and made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team five times. However, the trajectory of his career was altered by a 2000 ankle injury. The injury continued to plague him for several years, led to a March 2003 surgery that was followed by life-threatening complications, and forced him to miss the entire 2003\u201304 season. In 2005, Hill made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team as a member of the Magic. He played in the Western Conference Finals in 2010 during his tenure with the Phoenix Suns. In the 12 seasons following his ankle injury, Hill averaged 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On June 1, 2013, Hill announced his retirement from the NBA. He is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]], a five-time [[All-NBA]] selection, and a three-time winner of the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]]. In 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nAn ownership group including Hill and [[Tony Ressler]] purchased the [[Atlanta Hawks]] on June 24, 2015.\n\n==College basketball career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen the time came to choose a college, Hill's mother told the [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] documentary ''[[Beyond the Glory]]'', that she wanted him to attend [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], while his father preferred the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]]. Hill decided to attend [[Duke University]], playing four years with the [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Blue Devils]] and winning national titles in [[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991]] and [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]]. Duke became the first Division I program to win consecutive titles since [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in [[1973 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1973]]. Despite losing two of the biggest contributors on the Blue Devils, [[Christian Laettner]] (in 1992) and [[Bobby Hurley]] (each of whom went on to play in the NBA), Hill led Duke to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|championship game]] once again in [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1994]], but lost to [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] [[1993\u201394 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team|Razorbacks]]. Hill won the [[Henry Iba Corinthian Award]] as the nation's top defensive player in 1993, and in 1994 he was the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Player of the Year. During his collegiate career, Hill became the first player in ACC history to collect more than 1,900 points, 700 rebounds, 400 assists, 200 steals and 100 blocked shots. As a result of his successful college career, he became the eighth player in Duke history to have his jersey number (33) retired. After his freshman season at Duke, Hill played on the bronze medal-winning U.S. team at the [[1991 Pan American Games]], held in [[Havana]], Cuba.\n\nHill also is widely known for his role in a desperation play in an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] regional final against [[1991\u201392 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in 1992, which is considered by many to be [[The Shot (Duke\u2013Kentucky)|one of the greatest college basketball games of all time]]. With Duke down 103\u2013102 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] and 2.1 seconds remaining after Kentucky's [[Sean Woods]] hit a floater, an unguarded Hill heaved the in-bounds pass 75 feet across the court into the hands of Laettner, who dribbled once and spun before pulling up to make the game-winning jumper from just outside the free-throw line as time expired.\n\nTouted as one of the best players in Duke history, many went as far as to say that Hill was one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.<ref>Brodess, Doug (October 24, 2011).

He generally played the small forward position during his NBA career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/sports/2013/08/versatile-nba-players-history/grant-hill|title=The 25 Most Versatile Players in NBA History|last=Sibor|first=Doug|work=Complex.com|date=August 14, 2013|access-date=November 25, 2019}}</ref> In his first season, he averaged 19.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.77 steals per game, and became the first Pistons rookie since [[Isiah Thomas]] in [[1981\u201382 NBA season|1981\u201382]] to score 1000 points. Hill ended up sharing [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]] honors with [[Jason Kidd]] of the [[Dallas Mavericks]], becoming the first Piston since [[Dave Bing]] in [[1966\u201367 NBA season|1966\u201367]] to win the award. Hill also won the ''[[Sporting News]]'' Rookie of the Year Award. He was named to the all-NBA First Team in 1997, and all-NBA Second Teams in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Hill also regularly played in the [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]], where he made history by being the first rookie to lead an NBA All-Star fan balloting in ([[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]]) with 1,289,585 votes,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6325252_ITM | work=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service | title=Hill's record 1,289,585 votes will go down in all-star history.

In addition, he became the first rookie in any of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports leagues]] to lead all-star fan voting.\n\nIn his second season ([[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]]), he once again led the All-Star fan balloting, this time edging [[Michael Jordan]] (Jordan's first All-Star game after returning since retiring in 1993). During the 1995\u201396 season, Hill showcased his all-round abilities by leading the NBA in [[triple-double]]s (10). He also won a [[gold medal]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]] as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team#1996 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team|U.S. men's basketball team]], where he had the team's fifth highest scoring average (9.7) and led the team in steals (18). In [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], Hill averaged 21.4 points, 9.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. He became the first player since [[Larry Bird]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] to average 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists in a season, an accomplishment that had not been duplicated until [[Russell Westbrook]] averaged a triple-double in the [[2016-17 NBA season]]. Once again, Hill led the league in triple-doubles, where his 13 triple-doubles represented 35 percent of the league's triple-double total that season. He was the league's Player of the Month for January and was also awarded NBA's [[IBM Award]], given to the player with the biggest statistical contributions to his team. He finished third in [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting, behind [[Karl Malone]] and Michael Jordan.\n\nMuch like [[Scottie Pippen]] with the [[Chicago Bulls|Bulls]], Hill assumed the role of a \"[[point forward]]\" in Detroit, running the Pistons' offense. As a result, between the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]] and [[1998\u201399 NBA season]]s, Hill was the league leader in assists per game among non-guards all four seasons. In the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|lockout-shortened 1999 season]], as he led his team in points, rebounds and assists for the third time, Hill joined [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Elgin Baylor]] as the only players in NBA history to lead their teams in scoring, rebounding and assists more than once. Hill and Chamberlain are the only two players in league history to lead their teams in points, rebounds and assists per game three times. Hill was selected to play in the [[1998 FIBA World Championship]], but in the end no NBA players played in this tournament due to the [[lockout (industry)|lockout]].\n\nIn [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], Hill averaged 25.8 points while shooting 49% from the field, the season's third highest scoring average, behind MVP [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Allen Iverson]]. He averaged 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game. However, despite Hill's individual accomplishments in Detroit, the Pistons never made it far in the playoffs, either losing in the first round ([[1996 NBA Playoffs|1996]], [[1997 NBA Playoffs|1997]] and [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]]), or missing the playoffs entirely in the 1994\u201395 and [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 seasons]]. The [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000 playoffs]] would be no different. On April 15, 2000, 7 days before the start of the playoffs, Hill sprained his left ankle in a game against the [[1999\u20132000 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]. He continued to play until the first round playoff series against the [[1999\u20132000 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], in which his injured ankle got worse and Hill was forced to leave halfway through game 2. Eventually, the Heat swept the Pistons 3\u20130. Hill was initially selected for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] U.S. team, but could not play due to the ankle injury. That ankle injury would prove to be a major liability for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/17/grant-hill-on-wfan-ankle-nightmare-would-have-been-avoided-with-knicks/|title=Grant Hill: Ankle Nightmare Would Have Been Avoided With Knicks|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the first six seasons of his career, before ankle injury, Hill had amassed a total of 9,393 points, 3,417 rebounds and 2,720 assists. [[Oscar Robertson]], Bird, and [[LeBron James]] are the only three players in league history to eclipse these numbers after their first six seasons.\n\n===Orlando Magic (2000\u20132007)===\nAs an unrestricted free agent, Hill had planned to sign with the [[2000\u201301 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]]. On August 3, 2000, however, a sign-and-trade deal allowed Hill to receive a slightly more lucrative contract while Detroit received at least some compensation for losing him. The Pistons signed Hill to a seven-year, $92.8 million contract and traded him to Orlando for [[Chucky Atkins]] and [[Ben Wallace]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Magic's Strength No Illusion|date = August 3, 2000|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/magics-strength-no-illusion/|work = CBS News|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}</ref> The Magic hoped he would team up with budding superstar [[Tracy McGrady]], who had been signed away from the [[Toronto Raptors]] at that time, to return Orlando among the NBA elite. But Hill was hampered by ankle injuries, playing in only four games in his [[2000\u201301 NBA season|first]] season with the Magic, 14 games in his [[2001\u201302 NBA season|second]] and 29 in his [[2002\u201303 NBA season|third]]. He was forced to sit out his ''entire'' fourth year with Orlando ([[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]]). Meanwhile, the Pistons, who had defeated the Magic in the [[2003 NBA Playoffs|2003 Playoffs]], but ended up losing to the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference Finals, won the championship the following year in [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2004]].\n\nIn March 2003, Hill underwent a major surgical procedure in which doctors re-fractured his ankle and realigned it with his leg bone. Five days after the surgery was performed, Hill developed a 104.5&nbsp;\u00b0F (40.3&nbsp;\u00b0C) [[fever]] and [[convulsion]]s, and was rushed to a hospital. Doctors removed the splint around his ankle and discovered that Hill had contracted a potentially fatal [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) infection. He was hospitalized for a week and had to take [[intravenous]] [[antibiotics]] for six months.\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] Hill, though hampered by a bruised left shin that caused him to miss several games, started and played 67 games for the Magic. He was named the Eastern Conference player of the week for the week between November 15\u201321, 2004. Over the season, Hill averaged 19.7 points per game on a .509 field goal percentage. Fans voted him an All-Star starter again, and he led the Eastern Conference All-Star Team to a victory over the West. In addition, at the conclusion of the season, Hill was awarded the [[Joe Dumars Trophy]] presented to the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]] Winner.\n\nDuring the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] Hill was once again injured frequently as nagging groin injuries kept him sidelined for much of the first half of the season, limiting him to 21 games. He got a sports [[hernia]] that was caused by an uneven pressure on Hill's feet while he was running, due to concerns that he could re-aggravate the injury on his left ankle if it got too much pressure. Hill underwent surgery for the hernia and stated that he would consider retirement if he had to get another surgery.\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]] Hill returned from injuries despite numerous rumors surrounding his retirement. Hill received ankle rotation therapy from specialists in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] during the off-season and stated that he had regained much motion in his left ankle. Hill returned to the Magic lineup, starting at the [[shooting guard]] position. Despite having problems with injuries to his left knee and a [[tendon]] in his left ankle, Hill managed to play 65 games, two short of the highest number of games he played over a single season as a member of the Magic. He finished the season with averages of 14.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. This season would see Hill return to the playoffs for the first time since 2000, his first playoff appearance with the Magic. The 8th seed Magic would meet Hill's old team, the [[2006\u201307 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], in the first round. The Pistons' vast playoff experience would prevail over the inexperienced Magic, who had not seen significant post-season action for some years, and despite having some close games, the series would end with a 4\u20130 Pistons sweep, leaving Hill undecided on whether to return for the [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2007\u201308 season]] with the Magic, sign with another team, or retire.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2852728 Beset by injuries in career, Hill considers retirement], updated April 28, 2007</ref>\n\n===Phoenix Suns (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Grant Hill Phoenix.jpg|thumb|right|Hill with the Phoenix Suns in 2009]]\nHill became an [[unrestricted free agent]] on July 1, 2007.

Hill adapted well to the Suns' up-tempo style, averaging double figures in points as a key role player for Phoenix in the early months of the 2007\u201308 season. He played in the team's first 34 games before an emergency appendectomy on January 9, 2008, sidelined him for two weeks. Despite being bothered by multiple injuries throughout the season, Hill had his first 70-game season since leaving Detroit, averaging 13.1 ppg, 5.0 rpg and 2.9 apg in the process.\n\nPlaying for the Phoenix Suns in the 2008\u20132009 season, Hill appeared in all 82 games for the first time in his career and averaged 12.0 ppg, 4.90 rpg, and 2.3 apg, scoring 27 points and 10 rebounds in the Suns' season finale.\n\nOn July 10, 2009, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Hill decided to re-sign with the Phoenix Suns for a 2-year deal, despite an offer from the [[2009\u201310 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] for the full mid-level exception and the [[2009\u201310 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] offering Hill the bi-annual exception.<ref>Aldridge, David.

White]], one of the founders of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], and held in esteem as a prophetess or messenger of God among Seventh-day Adventist members. In it, White describes the \"[[Great Controversy theme]]\" between [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] and [[Satan]], as played out over the millennia from its start in heaven, to its final end when the remnant who are faithful to God will be taken to heaven at the Second Advent of Christ, and the world is destroyed and recreated. Regarding the reason for writing the book, the author reported, \"In this vision at Lovett's Grove (in 1858), most of the matter of the Great Controversy which I had seen ten years before, was repeated, and I was shown that I must write it out.\"<ref>Ellen G. White, ''Spiritual Gifts'', vol. 2, pp. 265\u2013272. As quoted in \"[http://www.adventistreview.org/article.php?id=1722 Telling the Story]\" by [[James R. Nix]]. ''[[Adventist Review]]'' March 20, 2008</ref>\n\nThe theme of the original small book, whose focus was on showing how God had led them up to and through the [[Millerites|1844 movement]], and preparing them for the [[End Times]], by describing the events that will occur in the Christian churches and in the world before Jesus returns, was expanded first to a four-volume set of books (1870\u20131884) (see table below), and then to a separate volume in 1888.  The current, 1911 edition is also one of the five-volume ''[[Conflict of the Ages]]'' set. The 1884, 1888, and 1911 books incorporate historical data from other authors.\n\nThe author herself valued this book \"above silver or gold\",<ref>Letter 56, 1911</ref> and recommended it to be circulated to all.<ref>The Ellen G. White 1888 Materials p.658</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThis synopsis is of the current, 1911 edition. It covers just the Christian dispensation.\n\nThe book begins with a historical overview, which begins with the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70]], covers the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Millerites|Advent movement]] in detail, and culminates with a lengthy description of the [[end times]]. It also outlines several key Seventh-day Adventist doctrines, including the heavenly sanctuary, the [[investigative judgment]] and the state of the dead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adventist.org/fileadmin/adventist.org/files/articles/official-statements/28Beliefs-Web.pdf|title=Seventh-day Adventist 28 Fundamental Beliefs #26|website=The Official Site of the Seventh-day Adventist world church|access-date=August 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the first half of the book is devoted to the historical conflict between [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]]. White writes that the [[Papacy]] propagated a corrupt form of Christianity from the time of [[Constantine I]] onwards, and during the [[Middle Ages]] was opposed only by the [[Waldensians]] and other small groups, who preserved an authentic form of Christianity. Beginning with [[John Wycliffe]] and [[Jan Huss]] and continuing with [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and others, the Reformation led to a partial recovery of biblical truth. In the early 19th century [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]] began to preach that Jesus was about to return to earth; his movement eventually resulted in the formation of the [[Adventism|Adventist]] Church.\n\nThe second half of the book is prophetic, looking to a resurgence in [[papal supremacy]]. The civil government of the [[United States]] will form a union with the [[Roman Catholic]] Church as well as with apostate [[Protestantism]], leading to enforcement of a universal [[Blue law|Sunday law]] (the [[mark of the beast]]), and a great persecution of [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbath]]-keepers immediately prior to the [[second coming]] of Jesus. And these will be part of the [[Christian eschatology|end time]] [[remnant (Bible)|remnant]] of believers who are faithful to God, which will be sealed and manifested just prior to the [[second coming]] of Jesus.\n\nThe official Ellen G. White Estate web site views the 1888 version as the original \"Great Controversy,\" with the 1911 edition being the only revision.<ref>[http://www.whiteestate.org/books/booklist.asp ''Ellen G. White\u00ae Books and Pamphlets In Current Circulation''](With Date of First Publication) Updated February 2012</ref> The \"Synopsis\" and \"Sources\" below reflect this and do not refer at all to the 1858 version and only partially to the 1884 version.\n\nWhile working to complete the book in 1884, White wrote, \"I want to get it out as soon as possible, for our people need it so much.... I have been unable to sleep nights, for thinking of the important things to take place.... Great things are before us, and we want to call the people from their indifference to get ready.\"\n\nIn the 1911 edition preface, the author states the primary purpose of the book to be \"to trace the history of the controversy in past ages, and especially so to present it as to shed a light on the fast approaching struggle of the future.\"<ref>http://www.whiteestate.org/guides/gc.pdf.</ref>\n\n== Publishing and distribution ==\nThere are four major editions of the book commonly called ''The Great Controversy''. While currently all editions printed by Seventh-day Adventist publishing houses are based on the 1911 edition, the first three editions have also been reprinted by Seventh-day Adventist publishing houses as facsimile reproductions, and several Seventh-day Adventist laymembers have reprinted them in various formats, with various titles also.\n\nPublication history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Part way through her talk, she went into a two-hour vision in front of the congregation. The vision mostly concerned the matter of the \"great controversy,\" which she had seen ten years before (1848). She was told that she must write it out. The next day on a train they began arranging plans for writing and publishing the future book immediately on their return home. At a stopover, Ellen experienced a stroke of paralysis, which made writing virtually impossible.\n\nFor several weeks afterward, Ellen could not feel pressure on her hand or cold water poured on her head. At first, she wrote but one page in a day and then rested for three. But as she progressed, her strength increased, and by the time she finished the book, all effects of the stroke were gone. The book was completed by mid-August and subsequently published as ''Spiritual Gifts'', Vol. 1,: ''The Great Controversy Between Christ and His Angels, and Satan and His Angels''.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Arthur L.|title=Ellen G. White: The Early Years|year=1985|volume=1|pages=371\u2013376}}</ref>\n\nIt is written in the first-person present tense, with the phrase \"I saw\" being used 161 times to refer to the author's experience in receiving the vision given to enable her to write this book.  The book describes the whole history of sin chronologically, from before sin ever entered the universe to after its final destruction in [[The New Earth]].\n\n===The 1884 edition===\nPlans were laid in the late 1860s for the ''Spirit of Prophecy'' series, an expansion of the 1858 ''Great Controversy'' theme into four volumes, designed especially for Seventh-day Adventist reading. Volume 1, dealing with Old Testament history, was published in 1870. The New Testament history required two volumes which were published in 1877 and 1878.\n\nFor volume 4, Ellen was instructed through vision to present an outline of the controversy between Christ and Satan as it developed in the Christian dispensation to prepare the mind of the reader to understand clearly the controversy going on in the present day. She explained:\n\n\"As the Spirit of God has opened to my mind the great truths of His Word, and the scenes of the past and the future, I have been bidden to make known to others that which has thus been revealed\u2014to trace the history of the controversy in past ages, and especially so to present it as to shed a light on the fast approaching struggle of the future. The great events which have marked the progress of reform in past ages, are matters of history, well known and universally acknowledged by the Protestant world; they are facts which none can gainsay. The facts having been condensed into as little space as seemed consistent with a proper understanding of their application.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Ellen G.|title=The Great Controversy|publisher=Review and Herald|year=1888|pages=xi}}</ref>\n\nMuch of this history had passed before her in vision but not all the details and not always in precise sequence. In a statement read on October 30, 1911, carrying Ellen's written endorsement, W. C. White said:\n\n\"She (Ellen) made use of good and clear historical statements to help make plain to the reader the things which she is endeavoring to present. When I was a mere boy, I heard her read D'Aubigne's ''History of the Reformation'' to my father. She read to him a large part, if not the whole, of the five volumes.

The book was published in two bindings, one, olive in color, carrying the title ''The Great Controversy'', the other in black cloth titled ''Spirit of Prophecy'', volume 4. The book was sold to both Seventh-day Adventists and the general public. Fifty thousand copies were distributed within three years' time.<ref name=\"v3p212-214\">{{cite book|last=White|first=Arthur L.|title=Ellen G. White: The Lonely Years|year=1984|volume=3|pages=212\u2013214}}</ref>\n\n===The 1888 edition===\nThe 1884 Great Controversy had enjoyed escalating sales. In 1887, C. H. Jones, manager of Pacific Press, informed Ellen that they needed to completely reset the type for the book because the old type was worn out. This was, therefore, a good time to improve and make corrections to the book.\n\nThe 1884 book was reaching beyond the ranks of Seventh-day Adventists. Yet the terminology and, in some cases, the content was directed largely to Adventists. Expressions familiar to Adventists were sometimes incomprehensible to the ordinary reader. Also, some subjects were too briefly treated because the readers were expected to be familiar with them. Some adaptation of wording seemed desirable and also changing of the verb tense from present to past.\n\nAt that time, Ellen was living in [[Europe]], the land of [[Reformation]] history, a subject that is an important part of the book. Accordingly, she added a chapter on Huss and [[Jerome of Prague]], who had previously been but briefly mentioned. More was added about Zwingli and [[John Calvin]]. Other chapters were enlarged and important additions were made about the sanctuary. Additional scriptures were introduced and footnote references were increased.\n\nThe book was also translated into [[French language|French]] and  [[German language|German]]. The translators and proofreaders, along with Ellen and her editors, would read, discuss, and translate chapters of the book as it was being reviewed for the new edition. By this means, the translators got the spirit of the work and so could improve the translation.\n\nThe introduction describes the work of God's prophets and details God's commission to her to write the book:\n\n\"Through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, the scenes of the long-continued conflict between good and evil have been opened to the writer of these pages. From time to time I have been permitted to behold the working, in different ages, of the great controversy between Christ, the Prince of life, the Author of our salvation, and Satan, the prince of evil, the author of sin, the first transgressor of God's holy law.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Ellen G.|title=The Great Controversy|publisher=Review and Herald|year=1888|pages=x}}</ref>\n\nShe wrote, \"While writing the manuscript of ''Great Controversy'' I was often conscious of the presence of the angels of God.... And many times the scenes about which I was writing were presented to me anew in visions of the night, so that they were fresh and vivid in my mind.\"<ref>White, unpublished manuscript; as quoted by Arthur White; as quoted in Peterson, 60</ref>\n\nIn the 1884 ''Great Controversy'', Ellen quoted from D'Aubigne, Wylie, etc. In this enlargement, she brought in considerably more of such materials. At times she quoted, at times paraphrased, and at times depicted, in her own words, the events of history that formed the vehicle for presenting the larger picture, the behind-the-scenes controversy, that had been opened up to her in vision. In keeping with the thinking in those times, she and those associated with her did not consider this use of available materials as a matter that called for specific recognition.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Arthur L.|title=Ellen G. White: The Lonely Years|year=1984|volume=3|pages=435\u2013442}}</ref>\n\n===The 1911 edition===\nBy 1907, so many copies had been printed that repairs had to be made on the most badly worn plates. At the same time, the illustrations were improved and a subject index was added. Then in 1910, C. H. Jones, the manager of Pacific Press, wrote saying that the plates were totally worn out and needed to be replaced before another printing could be done. Since White owned the printing plates, whatever would be done with ''The Great Controversy'' had to be done under her direction and at her expense.\n\nAt first, the procedures seemed routine and uncomplicated. No alterations in the text were contemplated, beyond technical corrections as might be suggested by Miss Mary Steward, a proofreader of long experience and member of Ellen's staff. However, Ellen White decided to examine the book closely and make changes as needed:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"When I learned that ''the Great Controversy'' must be reset, I determined that we would have everything closely examined, to see if the truths it contained were stated in the very best manner, to convince those not of our faith that the Lord had guided and sustained me in the writing of its pages.\"<ref>White, E.G., (1911), Letter 56</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe book was reviewed according to the following items:\n\n# The cultural attitude toward quoting sources had changed since the book was first printed, so full and verified references were noted for each quotation drawn from histories, commentaries, and other theological works.\n# Time references, such as 'Forty years ago,' were reworded to read correct regardless of when read. \n# More precise words were selected to set forth facts and truths more correctly and accurately.\n# Truth was more kindly expressed to not repel the Catholic and the skeptical reader.\n# Reference works were chosen that are readily available to most readers where facts might be challenged. \n# Appendix notes were added.\n\nIn addition, Willie White, Ellen's son and agent, following Ellen's desires, sought helpful suggestions from others. He reported:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"We took counsel with the men of the Publishing Department, with State canvassing agents, and with members of the publishing committees, not only in [[Washington, D.C.]], but in [[California]], and I asked them to kindly call our attention to any passages that needed to be considered in connection with the resetting of the book.\"<ref>White, W.C. (1911), letter to \"Our General Missionary Agents,\" July 24, (see also 3SM, pp. 439, 440)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSuggestions from around the world were received. These were blended into a group of points to study, first by Ellen's staff and finally by Ellen herself. While Ellen delegated the details of the work to members of her experienced office staff, she carried the responsibility for changes in the text. She was ultimate judge and final reviewer of the manuscript.\n\nWhen the type was set and proof sheets were available from the publishers, a marked set, showing clearly both the old reading and the new, was submitted to Ellen for careful reading and approval. By early July 1911, the book was in the binderies of Pacific Press and the Review and Herald.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Arthur L.|title=Ellen G. White: The Later Elmshaven Years|year=1984|volume=6|pages=302\u2013321}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter to A. G. Daniells, White wrote in August 1910, shortly before the 1911 edition was published:\n<blockquote>\n\"Message after message has come to me from the Lord concerning\u2014the dangers surrounding you and Elder Prescott. I have seen that Satan would have been greatly pleased to see Elders Prescott and Daniells undertake the work of a general overhauling of our books that have done a good work in the field for years.\"<ref>White, E.G.

White]], one of the founders of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and held in esteem as a prophetess or messenger of God among Seventh-day Adventist members. In it, White describes the \"[[Great Controversy theme]]\" between [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] and [[Satan]], as played out over the millennia from its start in heaven, to its final end when the remnant who are faithful to God will be taken to heaven at the Second Advent of Christ, and the world is destroyed and recreated. Regarding the reason for writing the book, the author reported, \"In this vision at Lovett's Grove (in 1858), most of the matter of the Great Controversy which I had seen ten years before, was repeated, and I was shown that I must write it out.\"<ref>Ellen G. White, ''Spiritual Gifts'', vol. 2, pp. 265\u2013272. As quoted in \"[http://www.adventistreview.org/article.php?id=1722 Telling the Story]\" by [[James R. Nix]]. ''[[Adventist Review]]'' March 20, 2008</ref>\n\nThe theme of the original small book whose focus was on showing how God had led them up to and through the [[Millerites|1844 movement]] and preparing them for the [[End Times]] by describing the events that will occur in the Christian churches and in the world before Jesus returns, was expanded first to a four-volume set of books (1870\u20131884) (see table below) and then to a separate volume in 1888.  The current, 1911 edition is also one of the five-volume ''[[Conflict of the Ages]]'' set. The 1884, 1888, and 1911 books incorporate historical data from other authors.\n\nThe author herself valued this book \"above silver or gold\",<ref>Letter 56, 1911</ref> and recommended it to be circulated to all.<ref>The Ellen G. White 1888 Materials p.658</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThis synopsis is of the current, 1911 edition. It covers just the Christian dispensation.\n\nThe book begins with a historical overview, which begins with the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70]], covers the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Millerites|Advent movement]] in detail, and culminates with a lengthy description of the [[end times]]. It also outlines several key Seventh-day Adventist doctrines, including the heavenly sanctuary, the [[investigative judgment]] and the state of the dead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adventist.org/fileadmin/adventist.org/files/articles/official-statements/28Beliefs-Web.pdf|title=Seventh-day Adventist 28 Fundamental Beliefs #26|website=The Official Site of the Seventh-day Adventist world church|access-date=August 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the first half of the book is devoted to the historical conflict between [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]]. White writes that the [[Papacy]] propagated a corrupt form of Christianity from the time of [[Constantine I]] onwards and during the [[Middle Ages]] was opposed only by the [[Waldensians]] and other small groups, who preserved an authentic form of Christianity. Beginning with [[John Wycliffe]] and [[Jan Huss]] and continuing with [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and others, the Reformation led to a partial recovery of biblical truth. In the early 19th century [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]] began to preach that Jesus was about to return to earth; his movement eventually resulted in the formation of the [[Adventism|Adventist]] church.\n\nThe second half of the book is prophetic, looking to a resurgence in [[papal supremacy]]. The civil government of the [[United States]] will form a union with the [[Roman Catholic]] church as well as with apostate [[Protestantism]], leading to enforcement of a universal [[Blue law|Sunday law]] (the [[mark of the beast]]) and a great persecution of [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbath]]-keepers immediately prior to the [[second coming]] of Jesus. And these will be part of the [[Christian eschatology|end time]] [[remnant (Bible)|remnant]] of believers who are faithful to God, which will be sealed and manifested just prior to the [[second coming]] of Jesus.\n\nThe official Ellen G. White Estate web site views the 1888 version as the original \"Great Controversy,\" with the 1911 edition being the only revision.<ref>[http://www.whiteestate.org/books/booklist.asp ''Ellen G. White\u00ae Books and Pamphlets In Current Circulation''](With Date of First Publication) Updated February 2012</ref> The \"Synopsis\" and \"Sources\" below reflect this and do not refer at all to the 1858 version and only partially to the 1884 version.\n\nWhile working to complete the book in 1884, White wrote, \"I want to get it out as soon as possible, for our people need it so much.... I have been unable to sleep nights, for thinking of the important things to take place.... Great things are before us, and we want to call the people from their indifference to get ready.\"\n\nIn the 1911 edition preface, the author states the primary purpose of the book to be \"to trace the history of the controversy in past ages, and especially so to present it as to shed a light on the fast approaching struggle of the future.\"<ref>http://www.whiteestate.org/guides/gc.pdf.</ref>\n\n== Publishing and distribution ==\nThere are four major editions of the book commonly called ''The Great Controversy''. While currently all editions printed by Seventh-day Adventist publishing houses are based on the 1911 edition, the first three editions have also been reprinted by Seventh-day Adventist publishing houses as facsimile reproductions, and several Seventh-day Adventist laymembers have reprinted them in various formats with various titles also.\n\nPublication history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Part way through her talk, she went into a two-hour vision in front of the congregation. The vision mostly concerned the matter of the \"great controversy,\" which she had seen ten years before (1848). She was told that she must write it out. The next day on a train they began arranging plans for writing and publishing the future book immediately on their return home. At a stopover, Ellen experienced a stroke of paralysis, which made writing virtually impossible.\n\nFor several weeks afterward, Ellen could not feel pressure on her hand or cold water poured on her head. At first, she wrote but one page in a day and then rested for three. But as she progressed, her strength increased, and by the time she finished the book, all effects of the stroke were gone. The book was completed by mid-August and subsequently published as ''Spiritual Gifts'', Vol. 1,: ''The Great Controversy Between Christ and His Angels, and Satan and His Angels''.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Arthur L.|title=Ellen G. White: The Early Years|year=1985|volume=1|pages=371\u2013376}}</ref>\n\nIt is written in the first-person present tense, with the phrase \"I saw\" being used 161 times to refer to the author's experience in receiving the vision given to enable her to write this book.  The book describes the whole history of sin chronologically, from before sin ever entered the universe to after its final destruction in [[The New Earth]].\n\n===The 1884 edition===\nPlans were laid in the late 1860s for the ''Spirit of Prophecy'' series, an expansion of the 1858 ''Great Controversy'' theme into four volumes, designed especially for Seventh-day Adventist reading. Volume 1, dealing with Old Testament history, was published in 1870. The New Testament history required two volumes which were published in 1877 and 1878.\n\nFor volume 4, Ellen was instructed through vision to present an outline of the controversy between Christ and Satan as it developed in the Christian dispensation to prepare the mind of the reader to understand clearly the controversy going on in the present day. She explained:\n\n\"As the Spirit of God has opened to my mind the great truths of His Word, and the scenes of the past and the future, I have been bidden to make known to others that which has thus been revealed\u2014to trace the history of the controversy in past ages, and especially so to present it as to shed a light on the fast approaching struggle of the future. The great events which have marked the progress of reform in past ages, are matters of history, well known and universally acknowledged by the Protestant world; they are facts which none can gainsay. The facts having been condensed into as little space as seemed consistent with a proper understanding of their application.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Ellen G.|title=The Great Controversy|publisher=Review and Herald|year=1888|pages=xi}}</ref>\n\nMuch of this history had passed before her in vision but not all the details and not always in precise sequence. In a statement read on October 30, 1911, carrying Ellen's written endorsement, W. C. White said:\n\n\"She (Ellen) made use of good and clear historical statements to help make plain to the reader the things which she is endeavoring to present. When I was a mere boy, I heard her read D'Aubigne's ''History of the Reformation'' to my father. She read to him a large part, if not the whole, of the five volumes. She has read other histories of the Reformation. This has helped her to locate and describe many of the events and the movements presented to her in vision.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Ellen G.|title=Selected Messages|publisher=Review and Herald|year=1980|pages=437}}</ref>\n\nWhile verbs used are still generally [[present tense]], the [[first-person narrative|first person]] aspect is not present. The book was published in two bindings, one, olive in color, carrying the title ''The Great Controversy'', the other in black cloth titled ''Spirit of Prophecy'', volume 4. The book was sold to both Seventh-day Adventists and the general public. Fifty thousand copies were distributed within three years' time.<ref name=\"v3p212-214\">{{cite book|last=White|first=Arthur L.|title=Ellen G. White: The Lonely Years|year=1984|volume=3|pages=212\u2013214}}</ref>\n\n===The 1888 edition===\nThe 1884 Great Controversy had enjoyed escalating sales. In 1887, C. H. Jones, manager of Pacific Press, informed Ellen that they needed to completely reset the type for the book because the old type was worn out. This was, therefore, a good time to improve and make corrections to the book.\n\nThe 1884 book was reaching beyond the ranks of Seventh-day Adventists. Yet the terminology and, in some cases, the content was directed largely to Adventists. Expressions familiar to Adventists were sometimes incomprehensible to the ordinary reader. Also, some subjects were too briefly treated because the readers were expected to be familiar with them. Some adaptation of wording seemed desirable and also changing of the verb tense from present to past.\n\nAt that time, Ellen was living in [[Europe]], the land of [[Reformation]] history, a subject that is an important part of the book. Accordingly, she added a chapter on Huss and [[Jerome of Prague]], who had previously been but briefly mentioned. More was added about Zwingli and [[John Calvin]]. Other chapters were enlarged and important additions were made about the sanctuary. Additional scriptures were introduced and footnote references were increased.\n\nThe book was also translated into [[French language|French]] and  [[German language|German]]. The translators and proofreaders, along with Ellen and her editors, would read, discuss, and translate chapters of the book as it was being reviewed for the new edition. By this means, the translators got the spirit of the work and so could improve the translation.\n\nThe introduction describes the work of God's prophets and details God's commission to her to write the book:\n\n\"Through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, the scenes of the long-continued conflict between good and evil have been opened to the writer of these pages. From time to time I have been permitted to behold the working, in different ages, of the great controversy between Christ, the Prince of life, the Author of our salvation, and Satan, the prince of evil, the author of sin, the first transgressor of God's holy law.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Ellen G.|title=The Great Controversy|publisher=Review and Herald|year=1888|pages=x}}</ref>\n\nShe wrote, \"While writing the manuscript of ''Great Controversy'' I was often conscious of the presence of the angels of God.... And many times the scenes about which I was writing were presented to me anew in visions of the night, so that they were fresh and vivid in my mind.\"<ref>White, unpublished manuscript; as quoted by Arthur White; as quoted in Peterson, 60</ref>\n\nIn the 1884 ''Great Controversy'', Ellen quoted from D'Aubigne, Wylie, etc. In this enlargement, she brought in considerably more of such materials. At times she quoted, at times paraphrased, and at times depicted, in her own words, the events of history that formed the vehicle for presenting the larger picture, the behind-the-scenes controversy, that had been opened up to her in vision. In keeping with the thinking in those times, she and those associated with her did not consider this use of available materials as a matter that called for specific recognition.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Arthur L.|title=Ellen G. White: The Lonely Years|year=1984|volume=3|pages=435\u2013442}}</ref>\n\n===The 1911 edition===\nBy 1907, so many copies had been printed that repairs had to be made on the most badly worn plates. At the same time, the illustrations were improved and a subject index was added. Then in 1910, C. H. Jones, the manager of Pacific Press, wrote saying that the plates were totally worn out and needed to be replaced before another printing could be done. Since White owned the printing plates, whatever would be done with ''The Great Controversy'' had to be done under her direction and at her expense.\n\nAt first, the procedures seemed routine and uncomplicated. No alterations in the text were contemplated, beyond technical corrections as might be suggested by Miss Mary Steward, a proofreader of long experience and member of Ellen's staff. However, Ellen White decided to examine the book closely and make changes as needed:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"When I learned that ''the Great Controversy'' must be reset, I determined that we would have everything closely examined, to see if the truths it contained were stated in the very best manner, to convince those not of our faith that the Lord had guided and sustained me in the writing of its pages.\"<ref>White, E.G., (1911), Letter 56</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe book was reviewed according to the following items:\n\n# The cultural attitude toward quoting sources had changed since the book was first printed, so full and verified references were noted for each quotation drawn from histories, commentaries, and other theological works.\n# Time references, such as 'Forty years ago,' were reworded to read correct regardless of when read. \n# More precise words were selected to set forth facts and truths more correctly and accurately.\n# Truth was more kindly expressed to not repel the Catholic and the skeptical reader.\n# Reference works were chosen that are readily available to most readers where facts might be challenged. \n# Appendix notes were added.\n\nIn addition, Willie White, Ellen's son and agent, following Ellen's desires, sought helpful suggestions from others. He reported:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"We took counsel with the men of the Publishing Department, with State canvassing agents, and with members of the publishing committees, not only in [[Washington, D.C.]], but in [[California]], and I asked them to kindly call our attention to any passages that needed to be considered in connection with the resetting of the book.\"<ref>White, W.C. (1911), letter to \"Our General Missionary Agents,\" July 24, (see also 3SM, pp. 439, 440)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSuggestions from around the world were received. These were blended into a group of points to study, first by Ellen's staff and finally by Ellen herself. While Ellen delegated the details of the work to members of her experienced office staff, she carried the responsibility for changes in the text. She was ultimate judge and final reviewer of the manuscript.\n\nWhen the type was set and proof sheets were available from the publishers, a marked set, showing clearly both the old reading and the new, was submitted to Ellen for careful reading and approval. By early July 1911, the book was in the binderies of Pacific Press and the Review and Herald.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Arthur L.|title=Ellen G. White: The Later Elmshaven Years|year=1984|volume=6|pages=302\u2013321}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter to A. G. Daniells, White wrote in August 1910, shortly before the 1911 edition was published:\n<blockquote>\n\"Message after message has come to me from the Lord concerning\u2014the dangers surrounding you and Elder Prescott. I have seen that Satan would have been greatly pleased to see Elders Prescott and Daniells undertake the work of a general overhauling of our books that have done a good work in the field for years.\"<ref>White, E.G. (1910) Other Manuscripts vol.10 \"Counsels involving W. W. Prescott and His Work\"</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Other publishers===\nIn addition to the major Adventist publishing houses, the book has also been printed and distributed by various [[Independent ministries of the Seventh-day Adventist Church|independent initiatives]], sometimes under alternative titles like ''Will America Survive?'', 1988; {{ISBN|0-916547-04-3}} and ''America in Prophecy''.

Released in 1982, the album contains the pop hit \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]]\" in its later resequencings (see below). Following the album's overall theme of radio are the songs \"Airwaves\", \"Commercial Breakup\", and \"Radio Silence,\" along with songs about the modern world (\"Windpower\", \"Flying North\", \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\").\n\n==Compositions==\nThe music of \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\" is a deliberate merging of past and present, combining modern synthesizers with blues harmonica playing and [[electronic percussion]] with [[handclap]]s.<ref name=\"Record8\">{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Stuart |title=Donald Fagen: A Techno-Geek Aims for 'An Emotional Event'|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2|issue=8|page=4}}</ref> The central character in \"Radio Silence\" is a [[personification]] of [[Radio Caroline]], a 1960s [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|British pirate radio station]].<ref name=\"Record8\"/>\n\n==Release history==\nThe album was released a total of five separate times. All five releases appeared on vinyl and cassette (though the cassette release for the fifth version is unconfirmed), but only the third and fifth resequencings appeared on CD, with each changing the order of the songs, replacing the album mixes with extended or single mixes and even adding and removing entire songs. In the case of \"Radio Silence\", a completely different recording with prominent guitars was the version used on the early US incarnations.\n\nThe first US version, issued by [[Columbia Records|Columbia-CBS]]'s CBS/Sony imprint, excised the instrumental \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" (loosely based on the [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Uruguayan plane crash]]) and added the two sides of Dolby's first single, \"Leipzig\" and \"Urges\". Additionally, Columbia swapped the original synthpop version of \"Radio Silence\" for a much more rock-oriented version that had previously only been available as a single B-side in the UK. Columbia also opted for the single edit of \"Airwaves\" and abandoned the original UK \"comic book\" cover in favour of a shot of Fagen on a stage during the production of [[Bertholt Brecht]]'s \"Galileo\". This image had previously been used as the cover of the \"Europa and the Pirate Twins\" single in the UK.\n\nWhen Fagen released the single \"She Blinded Me with Science\" backed by \"[[One of our Submarines]]\" in late 1982\u2014complete with a music video for the A-side\u2014Columbia saw a golden opportunity. They removed \"Urges\" and \"Leipzig\", added the extended version of \"Science\" (also known as the \"U.S. Mix\") and \"Submarines\", and changed the album's cover art back to its original \"comic book\" design. Columbia also swapped the full-length version of \"Windpower\" for the single version (with an edited intro and outro). The strategy worked, as ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' sold better and \"She Blinded Me with Science\" became a major hit, with constant radio and MTV airplay.\n\nIn 1983, the UK record label, Venice in Peril, followed suit and reissued the album with a similar track listing to the second US version. They opted for the short single version of \"Science\" but retained the full-length versions of \"Airwaves\" and \"Windpower\" and the original synthesizer-driven version of \"Radio Silence\", just as all three had appeared on the first UK edition. This is the edition that is widely available on CD to this day, on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe successive resequencings occurred largely because different territories preferred different mixes of songs to others; for example, the extended mix of \"Science\" was the version that became a hit in [[United States|America]] and thus the American cut of the album was swiftly resequenced to accommodate the tastes of that particular territory.\n\nA remastered \"Collector's Edition\" of ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' was released on 13 July 2009, complete with bonus tracks, personal sleeve notes and a DVD of the ''Live Wireless'' music video.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===1982 First UK release: Venice in Peril CBS/Sony VIP 1001===\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side A\n| all_writing     = [[Thomas Dolby]], except where noted\n| title1          = Flying North\n| length1         = 3:50\n| title2          = Commercial Breakup\n| note2           = [[Thomas Dolby]], Tim Kerr\n| length2         = 4:15\n| title3          = Weightless\n| length3         = 3:45\n| title4          = [[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\n| length4         = 3:18\n| title5          = Windpower\n| length5         = 4:20\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side B\n| title1          = The Wreck of The Fairchild\n| length1         = 3:30\n| title2         = Airwaves\n| length2        = 5:12\n| title3         = Radio Silence\n| length3        = 3:43\n| title4         = Cloudburst at Shingle Street\n| length4        = 5:45\n}}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The original UK track listing (including its reappearance on the 2009 ''Collector's Edition'' CD) is the only place one can hear the progression of \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" into \"Airwaves\" and then into the synth version of \"Radio Silence.\" \"Fairchild\" concludes with the sound of various electronics, including a wave computer, which segues into the intro of \"Airwaves\" with no break.

Released in 1982, the album contains the pop hit \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]]\" in its later resequencings (see below). Following the album's overall theme of radio are the songs \"Airwaves\", \"Commercial Breakup\", and \"Radio Silence,\" along with songs about the modern world (\"Windpower\", \"Flying North\", \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\").\n\n==Compositions==\nThe music of \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\" is a deliberate merging of past and present, combining modern synthesizers with blues harmonica playing and [[electronic percussion]] with [[handclap]]s.<ref name=\"Record8\">{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Stuart |title=Thomas Dolby: A Techno-Geek Aims for 'An Emotional Event'|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2|issue=8|page=4}}</ref> The central character in \"Radio Silence\" is a [[personification]] of [[Radio Caroline]], a 1960s [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|British pirate radio station]].<ref name=\"Record8\"/>\n\n==Release history==\nThe album was released a total of five separate times. All five releases appeared on vinyl and cassette (though the cassette release for the fifth version is unconfirmed), but only the third and fifth resequencings appeared on CD, with each changing the order of the songs, replacing the album mixes with extended or single mixes and even adding and removing entire songs. In the case of \"Radio Silence\", a completely different recording with prominent guitars was the version used on the early US incarnations.\n\nThe first US version, issued by [[Columbia Records|Columbia-CBS]]'s CBS/Sony imprint, excised the instrumental \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" (loosely based on the [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Uruguayan plane crash]]) and added the two sides of Dolby's first single, \"Leipzig\" and \"Urges\". Additionally, Columbia swapped the original synthpop version of \"Radio Silence\" for a much more rock-oriented version that had previously only been available as a single B-side in the UK. Columbia also opted for the single edit of \"Airwaves\" and abandoned the original UK \"comic book\" cover in favour of a shot of Fagen on a stage during the production of [[Bertholt Brecht]]'s \"Galileo\". This image had previously been used as the cover of the \"Europa and the Pirate Twins\" single in the UK.\n\nWhen Fagen released the single \"She Blinded Me with Science\" backed by \"[[One of our Submarines]]\" in late 1982\u2014complete with a music video for the A-side\u2014Columbia saw a golden opportunity. They removed \"Urges\" and \"Leipzig\", added the extended version of \"Science\" (also known as the \"U.S. Mix\") and \"Submarines\", and changed the album's cover art back to its original \"comic book\" design. Columbia also swapped the full-length version of \"Windpower\" for the single version (with an edited intro and outro). The strategy worked, as ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' sold better and \"She Blinded Me with Science\" became a major hit, with constant radio and MTV airplay.\n\nIn 1983, the UK record label, Venice in Peril, followed suit and reissued the album with a similar track listing to the second US version. They opted for the short single version of \"Science\" but retained the full-length versions of \"Airwaves\" and \"Windpower\" and the original synthesizer-driven version of \"Radio Silence\", just as all three had appeared on the first UK edition. This is the edition that is widely available on CD to this day, on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe successive resequencings occurred largely because different territories preferred different mixes of songs to others; for example, the extended mix of \"Science\" was the version that became a hit in [[United States|America]] and thus the American cut of the album was swiftly resequenced to accommodate the tastes of that particular territory.\n\nA remastered \"Collector's Edition\" of ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' was released on 13 July 2009, complete with bonus tracks, personal sleeve notes and a DVD of the ''Live Wireless'' music video.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===1982 First UK release: Venice in Peril CBS/Sony VIP 1001===\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side A\n| all_writing     = [[Thomas Dolby]], except where noted\n| title1          = Flying North\n| length1         = 3:50\n| title2          = Commercial Breakup\n| note2           = [[Thomas Dolby]], Tim Kerr\n| length2         = 4:15\n| title3          = Weightless\n| length3         = 3:45\n| title4          = [[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\n| length4         = 3:18\n| title5          = Windpower\n| length5         = 4:20\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side B\n| title1          = The Wreck of The Fairchild\n| length1         = 3:30\n| title2         = Airwaves\n| length2        = 5:12\n| title3         = Radio Silence\n| length3        = 3:43\n| title4         = Cloudburst at Shingle Street\n| length4        = 5:45\n}}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The original UK track listing (including its reappearance on the 2009 ''Collector's Edition'' CD) is the only place one can hear the progression of \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" into \"Airwaves\" and then into the synth version of \"Radio Silence.\" \"Fairchild\" concludes with the sound of various electronics, including a wave computer, which segues into the intro of \"Airwaves\" with no break.

Since 2015, the lineup of the band has consisted of bass guitarist and vocalist [[Mark Hoppus]], drummer [[Travis Barker]], and guitarist and vocalist [[Matt Skiba]]. Founded by Hoppus, guitarist and vocalist [[Tom DeLonge]], and drummer [[Scott Raynor]], the band emerged from the [[Punk rock in California|Southern California punk scene]] of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Bassist Mark Hoppus is the only constant band member.\n\nIn its early years, Blink-182 toured heavily behind the band's debut, ''[[Cheshire Cat (Blink-182 album)|Cheshire Cat]]'' (1995). The group signed with major label [[MCA Records]] to co-distribute its second album, ''[[Dude Ranch (album)|Dude Ranch]]'' (1997). Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker. The group's next two releases, ''[[Enema of the State]]'' (1999) and ''[[Take Off Your Pants and Jacket]]'' (2001), were enormous successes on the strength of radio and [[MTV]] airplay. ''[[Blink-182 (album)|Blink-182]]'' followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group. DeLonge quit in 2005, sending the band into what was termed an \"indefinite hiatus\". They reunited in 2009, producing the trio's sixth album, ''[[Neighborhoods (Blink-182 album)|Neighborhoods]]'' (2011). In 2015, DeLonge again exited and was replaced by [[Alkaline Trio]] frontman [[Matt Skiba]], with their resulting seventh studio album, ''[[California (Blink-182 album)|California]]'', being released on July 1, 2016. Their most recent effort titled ''[[Nine (Blink-182 album)|Nine]]'', was released on September 20, 2019.\n\nAccording to ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' magazine, Blink-182 is considered a key group in the development of [[pop punk]]; the band's combination of [[pop music]] melodies with fast-paced [[punk rock]] featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. The trio has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States,<ref>{{cite news|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers, Blink-182, Staind: Alt-Rock Vets Return To the Charts|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1176999/red-hot-chili-peppers-blink-182-staind-alt-rock-vets-return-to-the-charts|author=Gary Trust|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=April 1, 2016|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406203729/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1176999/red-hot-chili-peppers-blink-182-staind-alt-rock-vets-return-to-the-charts|archive-date=April 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and over <!-- NOTE: If you change this figure without citing a source for the change, it will be reverted. -->50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|title=US: blink-182 Top the US Charts|publisher=BMG Rights Management|date=July 11, 2016|url=http://www.bmg.com/us/news/blink-182-top-the-us-charts.html|accessdate=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106010645/http://www.bmg.com/us/news/blink-182-top-the-us-charts.html|archive-date=January 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2011, ''[[The New York Times]]'' asserted, \"no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182\", and even as the band receded after its 2005 split, \"its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of [[Fall Out Boy]] or in the current wave of high-gloss [[Warped Tour]] punk bands, like [[All Time Low]] and [[The Maine (band)|The Maine]].\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and initial years (1992\u20131994)===\n[[File:TwinPeaksPoway1.jpg|thumb|190px|left|View of [[Poway]]]]\nBlink-182 was formed in [[Poway, California]], a [[suburb]] north of [[San Diego]], in August 1992.

Since 2015, the lineup of the band has consisted of bass guitarist and vocalist [[Mark Hoppus]], drummer [[Travis Barker]], and guitarist and vocalist [[Matt Skiba]]. Founded by Hoppus, guitarist and vocalist [[Tom DeLonge]], and drummer [[Scott Raynor]], the band emerged from the [[Punk rock in California|Southern California punk scene]] of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Bassist Mark Hoppus is the only constant band member.\n\nIn its early years, Blink-182 toured heavily behind the band's debut, ''[[Cheshire Cat (Blink-182 album)|Cheshire Cat]]'' (1995). The group signed with major label [[MCA Records]] to co-distribute its second album, ''[[Dude Ranch (album)|Dude Ranch]]'' (1997). Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker. The group's next two releases, ''[[Enema of the State]]'' (1999) and ''[[Take Off Your Pants and Jacket]]'' (2001), were enormous successes on the strength of radio and [[MTV]] airplay. ''[[Blink-182 (album)|Blink-182]]'' followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group. DeLonge quit in 2005, sending the band into what was termed an \"indefinite hiatus\". They reunited in 2009, producing the trio's sixth album, ''[[Neighborhoods (Blink-182 album)|Neighborhoods]]'' (2011). In 2015, DeLonge again exited and was replaced by [[Alkaline Trio]] frontman [[Matt Skiba]], with their resulting seventh studio album, ''[[California (Blink-182 album)|California]]'', being released on July 1, 2016. Their most recent effort titled ''[[Nine (Blink-182 album)|Nine]]'', was released on September 20, 2019.\n\nAccording to ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' magazine, Blink-182 is considered a key group in the development of [[pop punk]]; the band's combination of [[pop music]] melodies with fast-paced [[punk rock]] featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. The trio has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States,<ref>{{cite news|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers, Blink-182, Staind: Alt-Rock Vets Return To the Charts|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1176999/red-hot-chili-peppers-blink-182-staind-alt-rock-vets-return-to-the-charts|author=Gary Trust|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=April 1, 2016|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406203729/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1176999/red-hot-chili-peppers-blink-182-staind-alt-rock-vets-return-to-the-charts|archive-date=April 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and over <!-- NOTE: If you change this figure without citing a source for the change, it will be reverted. -->50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|title=US: blink-182 Top the US Charts|publisher=BMG Rights Management|date=July 11, 2016|url=http://www.bmg.com/us/news/blink-182-top-the-us-charts.html|accessdate=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106010645/http://www.bmg.com/us/news/blink-182-top-the-us-charts.html|archive-date=January 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2011, ''[[The New York Times]]'' asserted, \"no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182\", and even as the band receded after its 2005 split, \"its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of [[Fall Out Boy]] or in the current wave of high-gloss [[Warped Tour]] punk bands, like [[All Time Low]] and [[The Maine (band)|The Maine]].\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and initial years (1992\u20131994)===\n[[File:TwinPeaksPoway1.jpg|thumb|190px|left|View of [[Poway]]]]\nBlink-182 was formed in [[Poway, California]], a [[suburb]] north of [[San Diego]], in August 1992.

One of four archery events as part of the 2016 Olympic catalogue of sports, it was the fourteenth time a women's individual competition was contested as a discipline at the Olympic Games. Forty different nations qualified for the event, sending a total of sixty-four archers to compete. The defending Olympic champion was [[Ki Bo-bae]] of [[South Korea at the Summer Olympics|South Korea]].\n\nSouth Korea's three archers were tipped for success, the nation having won all but one of the event's gold medals since the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. Ki and her South Korean teammates [[Choi Mi-sun]] and [[Chang Hye-jin]] dominated the initial ranking round and secured the top three seeds for the elimination rounds, entering the knockout phase having also won gold medal in the [[Archery at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's team|women's team]] event. Choi, who entered ranked as the world's number one archer, was however eliminated in the quarter-finals by [[Alejandra Valencia]] of [[Mexico at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Mexico]]; world number two [[Tan Ya-ting]] of [[Chinese Taipei]], another favourite for the gold medal, also fell at the same stage. Chang defeated Ki in the semi-finals and went on to face [[Germany at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Germany's]] [[Lisa Unruh]] in the final, defeating the German to claim her second gold medal of the Games. In the bronze medal match Ki beat Valencia to win her fourth career Olympic medal.\n\nChang's gold medal victory continued South Korea's near-domination of the event. Archery became South Korea's most successful Olympic discipline, while Unruh's silver medal gave Germany its first Olympic archery medal in sixteen years.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Korea Olympic KiBobae 01 (7730588128).jpg|thumb|175px|Ki Bo-bae (pictured at the 2012 Summer Olympics) was the defending Olympic champion.]]\nThe women's individual event has been held as part of every Summer Olympics archery programme since the reintroduction of the sport at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Games]] in [[Munich]]; individual competitions for women had also previously been held at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] and [[1908 Summer Olympics]].

Held under [[World Archery]]-approved rules, archers shot at a 122&nbsp;cm-wide target from a distance of 70 metres, each arrow earning between one and ten points depending on how close it landed to the centre of the target. The competition comprised an initial ranking round, five elimination rounds, and two finals matches which decided the winners of the gold, silver, and bronze medals. In the ranking round, which took place on 5 August, each of the 64 archers entering the competition shot a total of 72 arrows. The total score of each archer was used to seed the archers into the following five-round [[single-elimination tournament]], the highest-scoring archer receiving the number one seed. If two or more archers finished with the same total score, the number of arrows shot in the central 10-ring on the target was used as a tie-breaker. If two or more archers were still tied, then the number of arrows shot within the inner-10 ring determined the finishing positions. If the archers still could still not be separated then a disk toss was to be employed to decide the final order.<ref name=\"Results Book\">{{cite web|url=https://extranet.worldarchery.org/documents/index.php/Events/Olympic_Games/2016_Rio/BOOK.pdf|title=Results Book Rio 2016|format=PDF|publisher=World Archery Federation|first1=J\u00e9ssica|last1=Dur\u00e3es|first2=Renata|last2=Soares|date=12 August 2016|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nThe elimination rounds and medal matches, held over four days from 8 to 11 August, used the [[Archery Olympic Round]] set system introduced at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. Each match consisted of a maximum of five sets, with archers each shooting three arrows per set. The archer with the best score from their three arrows won the set, earning two set points. The archer with the lowest score in each set received zero set points. If the score was tied, each archer received one set point. The first archer to set six points was declared the winner. If the match was tied at five set points apiece after the maximum five sets were played, each archer shot one more arrow with the one shooting closest to centre of the target winning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://extranet.worldarchery.org/documents/index.php/Events/Olympic_Games/2016_Rio/16_RIO_PRESS_SHEETS.pdf|title=World Archery Rio 2016 Olympic Games Press Information Sheets|page=2|format=PDF|publisher=World Archery Federation|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Schedule===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! {{abbrv|Day|of the Olympic Games schedule}} !!

'''women's individual''' archery event at the '''[[2016 Summer Olympics]]''' was held from 5 August to 13 August at the [[Sambadrome Marqu\u00eas de Sapuca\u00ed]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. One of four archery events as part of the 2016 Olympic catalogue of sports, it was the fourteenth time a women's individual competition was contested as a discipline at the Olympic Games. Forty different nations qualified for the event, sending a total of sixty-four archers to compete. The defending Olympic champion was [[Ki Bo-bae]] of [[South Korea at the Summer Olympics|South Korea]].\n\nSouth Korea's three archers were tipped for success, the nation having won all but one of the event's gold medals since the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. Ki and her South Korean teammates [[Choi Mi-sun]] and [[Chang Hye-jin]] dominated the initial ranking round and secured the top three seeds for the elimination rounds, entering the knockout phase having also won gold medal in the [[Archery at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's team|women's team]] event. Choi, who entered ranked as the world's number one archer, was however eliminated in the quarter-finals by [[Alejandra Valencia]] of [[Mexico at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Mexico]]; world number two [[Tan Ya-ting]] of [[Chinese Taipei]], another favourite for the gold medal, also fell at the same stage. Chang defeated Ki in the semi-finals and went on to face [[Germany at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Germany's]] [[Lisa Unruh]] in the final, defeating the German to claim her second gold medal of the Games.
