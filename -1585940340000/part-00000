It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.<ref name=\"Fisher1\">{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Sharon|title=OS/2 EE to Get 3270 Interface Early|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YToEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=application+programming+interface&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWlZHBrYPoAhXlQd8KHWiECLMQ6AEwBHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=application%20programming%20interface&f=false|website=Google Books|date=1989}}</ref> An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be designed based on an industry standard to ensure interoperability. Some APIs have to be documented, others are designed so that they can be \"interrogated\" to determine supported functionality. Since other components/systems rely only on the API, the system that provides the API can (ideally) change its internal details \"behind\" that API without affecting its users.  \n\nToday, with the rise of [[REST]] and [[web services]] over [[HTTP]], the term is often assumed to refer to APIs of such services when given no other context (see the [[#Web APIs|Web APIs]] section).  \n\nSometimes the term API is, by extension, used to refer to the subset of software entities (code, subcomponents, modules, etc.) that serve to actually implement the API of some encompassing component or system.\n\n== Purpose ==\nIn building applications, an API (application programming interface) simplifies programming by [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstracting]] the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs. While a graphical interface for an [[email client]] might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file [[input/output]] might give the developer a [[Subroutine|function]] that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the [[Journaling file system|file system]] operations occurring behind the scenes.<ref name=\"Clarke4\">{{cite web|last1=3333Clarke|first1=Steven|title=Measuring API Usability|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/measuring-api-usability/184405654|website=Dr. Dobb's|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=2004}}</ref>, poo.\n\n== Usage ==\n\n===Libraries and frameworks===\nAn API usually is related to a [[library (computing)|software library]]. The API describes and prescribes the \"expected behavior\" (a specification) while the library is an \"actual implementation\" of this set of rules.\n\nA single API can have multiple implementations (or none, being abstract) in the form of different libraries that share the same programming interface.\n\nThe separation of the API from its implementation can allow programs written in one language to use a library written in another. For example, because [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] compile to compatible [[bytecode]], Scala developers can take advantage of any Java API.<ref name=\"OderskySpoonVenners8\">{{cite web|last1=Odersky|first1=Martin|last2=Spoon|first2=Lex|last3=Venners|first3=Bill|title=Combining Scala and Java|url=http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/combining-scala-and-java.html|website=www.artima.com|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=10 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nAPI use can vary depending on the type of programming language involved.\nAn API for a [[procedural programming|procedural language]] such as [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] could consist primarily of basic routines to execute code, manipulate data or handle errors while an API for an [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented language]], such as Java, would provide a specification of classes and its [[class method]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Figueiredo|first1=Luiz Henrique|last2=Ierusalimschy|first2=Roberto|last3=Filho|first3=Waldemar Celes|title=The design and implementation of a language for extending applications|journal=TeCGraf Grupo de Tecnologia Em Computacao Grafica|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2778436|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Sintes16\">{{cite web|last1=Sintes|first1=Tony|title=Just what is the Java API anyway?|url=http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077392/java-se/just-what-is-the-java-api-anyway.html|website=JavaWorld|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=2001-07-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Language binding]]s are also APIs.

An API approach is an architectural approach that revolves around providing a program interface to a set of services to different applications serving different types of consumers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/apis_for_dsi.pdf |website=www.hcltech.com |format=PDF download |title=API-fication |date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen used in the context of [[Web development tools|web development]], an API is typically defined as a set of specifications, such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, usually in an Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]) or JavaScript Object Notation ([[JSON]]) format. An example might be a shipping company API that can be added to an eCommerce-focused website to facilitate ordering shipping services and automatically include current shipping rates, without the site developer having to enter the shipper's rate table into a web database. While \"web API\" historically virtually has been synonymous for [[web service]], the recent trend (so-called [[Web 2.0]]) has been moving away from Simple Object Access Protocol ([[SOAP]]) based web services and [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA) towards more direct [[representational state transfer]] (REST) style [[web resource]]s and [[resource-oriented architecture]] (ROA).<ref>{{cite web\n |first        = Djamal\n |last         = Benslimane\n |author2      = Schahram Dustdar\n |author3      = Amit Sheth\n |title        = Services Mashups: The New Generation of Web Applications\n |url          = http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline/2008/09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |work         = IEEE Internet Computing, vol. 12, no. 5\n |publisher    = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n |pages        = 13\u201315\n |year         = 2008\n |access-date  = 2019-10-01\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928211221/http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline%2F2008%2F09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |archive-date = 2011-09-28\n |url-status   = dead\n}}</ref> Part of this trend is related to the [[Semantic Web]] movement toward [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), a concept to promote web-based [[ontology engineering]] technologies.

It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.<ref name=\"Fisher1\">{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Sharon|title=OS/2 EE to Get 3270 Interface Early|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YToEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=application+programming+interface&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWlZHBrYPoAhXlQd8KHWiECLMQ6AEwBHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=application%20programming%20interface&f=false|website=Google Books|date=1989}}</ref> An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be designed based on an industry standard to ensure interoperability. Some APIs have to be documented, others are designed so that they can be \"interrogated\" to determine supported functionality. Since other components/systems rely only on the API, the system that provides the API can (ideally) change its internal details \"behind\" that API without affecting its users.  \n\nToday, with the rise of [[REST]] and [[web services]] over [[HTTP]], the term is often assumed to refer to APIs of such services when given no other context (see the [[#Web APIs|Web APIs]] section).  \n\nSometimes the term API is, by extension, used to refer to the subset of software entities (code, subcomponents, modules, etc.) that serve to actually implement the API of some encompassing component or system.\n\n== Purpose ==\nIn building applications, an API (application programming interface) simplifies programming by [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstracting]] the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs. While a graphical interface for an [[email client]] might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file [[input/output]] might give the developer a [[Subroutine|function]] that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the [[Journaling file system|file system]] operations occurring behind the scenes.<ref name=\"Clarke4\">{{cite web|last1=3333Clarke|first1=Steven|title=Measuring API Usability|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/measuring-api-usability/184405654|website=Dr. Dobb's|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=2004}}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\n\n===Libraries and frameworks===\nAn API usually is related to a [[library (computing)|software library]]. The API describes and prescribes the \"expected behavior\" (a specification) while the library is an \"actual implementation\" of this set of rules.\n\nA single API can have multiple implementations (or none, being abstract) in the form of different libraries that share the same programming interface.\n\nThe separation of the API from its implementation can allow programs written in one language to use a library written in another. For example, because [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] compile to compatible [[bytecode]], Scala developers can take advantage of any Java API.<ref name=\"OderskySpoonVenners8\">{{cite web|last1=Odersky|first1=Martin|last2=Spoon|first2=Lex|last3=Venners|first3=Bill|title=Combining Scala and Java|url=http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/combining-scala-and-java.html|website=www.artima.com|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=10 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nAPI use can vary depending on the type of programming language involved.\nAn API for a [[procedural programming|procedural language]] such as [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] could consist primarily of basic routines to execute code, manipulate data or handle errors while an API for an [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented language]], such as Java, would provide a specification of classes and its [[class method]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Figueiredo|first1=Luiz Henrique|last2=Ierusalimschy|first2=Roberto|last3=Filho|first3=Waldemar Celes|title=The design and implementation of a language for extending applications|journal=TeCGraf Grupo de Tecnologia Em Computacao Grafica|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2778436|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Sintes16\">{{cite web|last1=Sintes|first1=Tony|title=Just what is the Java API anyway?|url=http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077392/java-se/just-what-is-the-java-api-anyway.html|website=JavaWorld|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=2001-07-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Language binding]]s are also APIs.

An example might be a shipping company API that can be added to an eCommerce-focused website to facilitate ordering shipping services and automatically include current shipping rates, without the site developer having to enter the shipper's rate table into a web database. While \"web API\" historically virtually has been synonymous for [[web service]], the recent trend (so-called [[Web 2.0]]) has been moving away from Simple Object Access Protocol ([[SOAP]]) based web services and [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA) towards more direct [[representational state transfer]] (REST) style [[web resource]]s and [[resource-oriented architecture]] (ROA).<ref>{{cite web\n |first        = Djamal\n |last         = Benslimane\n |author2      = Schahram Dustdar\n |author3      = Amit Sheth\n |title        = Services Mashups: The New Generation of Web Applications\n |url          = http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline/2008/09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |work         = IEEE Internet Computing, vol. 12, no. 5\n |publisher    = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n |pages        = 13\u201315\n |year         = 2008\n |access-date  = 2019-10-01\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928211221/http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline%2F2008%2F09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |archive-date = 2011-09-28\n |url-status   = dead\n}}</ref> Part of this trend is related to the [[Semantic Web]] movement toward [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), a concept to promote web-based [[ontology engineering]] technologies.

Changes to the API \u2014for example adding new parameters to a function call\u2014could break compatibility with the clients that depend on that API.<ref name=\"researchgate.net\">{{cite book|last1=Shi|first1=Lin|last2=Zhong|first2=Hao|last3=Xie|first3=Tao|last4=Li|first4=Mingshu|title=An Empirical Study on Evolution of API Documentation|journal=International Conference on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering|volume=6603|pages=416\u2013431|date=2011|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225147411|accessdate=22 July 2016|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-19811-3_29|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-642-19810-6}}</ref>\n\nWhen parts of a publicly presented API are subject to change and thus not stable, such parts of a particular API should be documented explicitly as \"unstable\". For example, in the [[Google Guava]] library, the parts that are considered unstable, and that might change in the near future, are marked with the [[Java annotation]] <code>@Beta</code>.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/ |title=guava-libraries - Guava: Google Core Libraries for Java 1.6+ - Google Project Hosting |date=2014-02-04 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}</ref>\n\nA public API can sometimes declare parts of itself as ''deprecated'' or rescinded. This usually means that part of the API should be considered a candidate for being removed, or modified in a backward incompatible way. Therefore, these changes allows developers to transition away from parts of the API that will be removed or not supported in the future.<ref name=\"OracleDeprecation16\">{{cite web|last1=Oracle|title=How and When to Deprecate APIs|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/deprecation/deprecation.html|website=Java SE Documentation|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nClient code may contain innovative or opportunistic usages that were not intended by the API designers.

Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization \nof Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to desintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation.]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.

The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers \nis observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation.

Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation.]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.

The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers \nis observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation.

In the US, only 26% of adults engage in vigorous leisure-time activity (which includes a sport) or exercising three or more times per week. In an effort to increase adult involvement and decrease the percentage of adult inactivity, the US Department of Health and Human Services has set a national health objective for 2010 that hopes to \"Reduce the prevalence of no leisure time activity from more than 25 percent to 20 percent of US adults\" (Berlin, Storti, and Brach 1137). In Australia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in 2011/12 adults spent an average of 33 minutes per day doing physical activity with 60% of the population doing less than 30 minutes and fewer than 20% doing an hour or more per day on average. The survey also showed almost 30% of the adult population reporting more than five hours of sedentary leisure activity each day.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4364.0.55.004Chapter4002011-12|title = Australian Bureau of Statistics|date = 2013-07-18|accessdate = 2015-04-16|website = Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nInactivity can contribute to a range of health related problems including: obesity, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and other disorders. Researches have shown, \"49 percent of heart disease in sedentary patients is due to lack of exercise\" (Perkins, Whitehead, Steptoe 725) and the relative risk of metabolic syndrome was, \"1.7 (95% CI 0.9\u20132.8) for lack of exercise, 1.5 (95% CI 1.1\u20132.1) for a positive family history and 2.0 (95% CI 1.2\u20133.4) in individuals with none or only an elementary school education versus university graduation\" (Lee et al. 48).\n\nInactivity in young people has been seen to be rising in recent years, and the prevalence of sedentary leisure activities for children is significant. Video games and the internet may play a part in this. It has been found that \"26 percent of children and adolescents in the United States spend more than four hours a day watching television, and they have become even more sedentary with access to computers and video games\" (Damlo 1434). Along with, \"62 percent of children nine to thirteen years of age do not participate in organized physical activities, and 23 percent do not participate in non-organized physical activities outside of school hours\" (1434).\n\nThere may be many reasons why people may remain inactive. One reason may be due to laziness. Individuals completed a Physical Activity Questionnaire and research showed \"Over one third (34 percent) of female and 12 percent of male adolescents had no leisure physical activity during a one-week period. Self-efficacy was found to have the highest correlation to leisure physical activity among all selected determinants, while 'laziness' had the highest correlation among perceived barriers\" (Analysis). Along with the questionnaire other research suggested that fitness groups and fitness programs positively altered the exercise behavior of families and youths.\n\nAnother reason for physical inactivity is the perception by populations that there is nowhere safe to do so. As cities become more populated, the increased need for housing overtakes the desire for parks, cycle and walk ways therefore increasing the amount of physical inactivity in the population. Ways that can help increase the amount of physical activity is to plan and build the environment in a way that makes the population of the community feel safe to be physically active in the area. This could be done for example by slowing speed limits to safer speeds and providing safe street crossings and also by building infrastructure close to the street and pathways with safe pedestrian and cycle access and safe bike parking.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/S149940460660211X/1-s2.0-S149940460660211X-main.pdf?_tid=557c0eb6-e426-11e4-bf44-00000aacb35f&acdnat=1429181582_7ab13abe8c50641d83cb170efe11af8b|title = Battling America's Epidemic of Physical Inactivity: Building More Walkable, Livable Communities|last = Fenton|first = Mark|date = December 2005|journal = Journal of Nutrition Education and Behaviour|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-04-16}}</ref> By implementing these simple changes into communities, the residents will have an increased feel in security and therefore increase their daily physical activity.\n\n==Initiatives==\nGiven the social and economic costs of low levels of physical activity there have been a number of public policy initiatives to raise the level, particularly focusing on children and adolescents.\n\n===Fitness portal===\nUnited States government agencies, at both Federal and State levels, have initiated a number of programs which include encouraging workers to bike to work rather than to drive. The Fitness Portal provides a range of tools, examples, and case studies of organization ideas. A few examples given by the Fitness Portal include: using the push mower, going for a walk, taking the stairs instead of an elevator, biking, running errands, visiting friends, cleaning out the garage or the attic, volunteering to become a coach or referee, signing up for a group exercise class, joining a softball league, or parking at the farthest end of the parking lot. For children they suggest: taking a dog for a walk, starting up a kickball game, joining a sports team, going to the park, helping their parents with yard work, playing tag, riding their bike to school, walking to the store, seeing how many jumping jacks they can do, or racing a friend to the end of the block.<ref>http://www.fitness.gov</ref>\n\n===Wellness On Wheels===\nThe Wear Valley District Council along with its local Durham Dales Primary Care Trust in England developed an innovative scheme in an effort to combat the high levels of poor health and obesity in the area. They created a mobile gym with electronic fitness monitoring equipment, which is called \"WOW\" (Wellness on Wheels). This effort was to persuade as many people as possible to enroll in regular workouts as part of a wider campaign in the district. Barry Nelson, a health editor for the ''Northern Echo'', in an interview noted a high level of interest generated. The strategy was to take exercise to people's homes rather than waiting for them to use existing leisure facilities. Children and adults, who otherwise wouldn't have exercised, came out to exercise in the mobile gym. Clearly, from this instance, the availability and nearness of a fitness program in a community positively affected the fitness behavior of the residents. As history explains, twenty-three years ago, Mr. Hackleman was named benefits manager. At this time the county had just three health and fitness programs: blood pressure screenings performed by public health nurses, a tennis tournament and some aerobics classes. However, soon after the roster grew to include at least five preventive health screening programs, eight healthy lifestyle and wellness programs, twelve health improvement and risk reduction programs and five family-life education programs. Finally in 2005, Ms. Gibson documented a total of 3,382 participants in the county's health and fitness programs, or 2,283 individuals, representing 41% of the county's population.\n\n===Walking School Bus===\n{{main|Walking bus}}\n[[File:T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d, Karlovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed, \u0161kolka na p\u0159echodu.jpg|thumb|[[T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d]]-Vnit\u0159n\u00ed M\u011bsto, T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d District, Vyso\u010dina Region, Czechia, Karlovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed]]\n[[File:Restaurace U Li\u0161k\u016f, u vstupu do ZOO Praha, U Trojsk\u00e9ho z\u00e1mku 9, Praha - Troja 01.JPG|thumb|Restaurant U Li\u0161k\u016f, originally a country house, U trojsk\u00e9ho z\u00e1mku str. 35/9 [[Troja (Prague)|Troja]]. At the entrance to the Prague Zoo.]]\nMost research that defends the idea of fitness programs increasing exercise practices among children and adults stems out of San Diego. Heritage Elementary school implemented its first walking school bus. This initiative had students walking to their designated stops, but not waiting for the school bus. Rather, waiting for a train of people on foot to pick them up. This allowed the students to walk to school with their peers. Although it is not directly stated, a major reason children choose to walk is because they fall victim to [[mob mentality]]. Perhaps the phrase, \"fall victim to mob mentality\" has a negative connotation, but that is, in essence, what the children do. Because so many other students were walking, all joined in. In this instance, mob mentality and mass behavior have a positive influence on fitness behavior, and encourage the students to exercise. The opinion of children, teachers and volunteers has been in general very favorable toward the project. Research states, \"91.4 percent of participating students stated they liked the initiative very much and 87.4 percent among them prefer to go to school by the Piedibus than by any other means. Teacher and volunteers outlined the social value of the project and the increase in physical activity as positive aspects of the project\". The group environment of the [[walking bus]] provides comfort in exercising, which in turn leads children to exercise more often. Although not exactly identical to the \"Forrest Gump phenomenon\", this walking school bus exhibits the same results: \"If I can do it, you can do it\".\n\n===Video games===\nSeveral [[video game]] companies have developed ways to mix the two spectrums of electronic and exercise. [[Dance Dance Revolution]], perhaps the most well-known exercise game, had players earn points by dancing to a beat. Players earn more points for tapping dance pads on the dancing platform at precise times and in proper sequences, thereby incorporating physical exercise.\n\nIn 2006 [[Nintendo]] introduced the [[Wii]], a next generation [[game console]] the features a motion sensitive controller. Many players have noticed the benefits of increased physical activity due to playing games on the Wii system, but that does not count as serious exercise.\n\n== Sedentary Behaviour ==\nAccording to Biddle (2007) the social influence of technology, such as electronic gaming and screen time are the main causes towards actions of sedentary behaviour, with TV viewing and computer use being the most prevalent benefactors. However, sedentary behaviours, are not simply \u201copposites\u201d of physical activity, but instead suggests that they \"displace time that would otherwise be used for physical activity\". (Biddle, 2007)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sedentary behaviour|last = Biddle|date = 2007|journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2007.08.002|pmid = |access-date = |volume=33 |issue = 6|pages=502\u2013504}}</ref>\n\nChildren and adolescents, are deemed most at risk for these sedentary behaviours with estimates for youth TV viewing being around \"1.8 - 2.8 hours per day\". Also Biddle (2007) states that for young people \"television took up 40% of the time spent in the five most prevalent sedentary behaviours during the week and 37% at weekends\" which stresses the negative impact of these social and technological advances on physical activity and fitness behaviour.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe study Hardy, Dobbins, Booth, Denney, Wilson and Okely (2006) stated that, \"there are powerful societal inducements to be inactive and there are increasing concerns of an emerging preference among young people to adopt sedentary lifestyles.\" Based on Australian adolescents, results were received which indicated that many young people are engaging in sedentary behaviour, with grade 6's spending 34 hours per week, grade 8's with 41 hours and grade 10's with 45 hours.

The study stated that in the last 20 years (1990-2010), the prevalence of obesity in Australia has more than doubled.

In the US, only 26% of adults engage in vigorous leisure-time activity (which includes a sport) or exercising three or more times per week. In an effort to increase adult involvement and decrease the percentage of adult inactivity, the US Department of Health and Human Services has set a national health objective for 2010 that hopes to \"Reduce the prevalence of no leisure time activity from more than 25 percent to 20 percent of US adults\" (Berlin, Storti, and Brach 1137). In Australia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in 2011/12 adults spent an average of 33 minutes per day doing physical activity with 60% of the population doing less than 30 minutes and fewer than 20% doing an hour or more per day on average. The survey also showed almost 30% of the adult population reporting more than five hours of sedentary leisure activity each day.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4364.0.55.004Chapter4002011-12|title = Australian Bureau of Statistics|date = 2013-07-18|accessdate = 2015-04-16|website = Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nInactivity can contribute to a range of health related problems including: obesity, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and other disorders. Researches have shown, \"49 percent of heart disease in sedentary patients is due to lack of exercise\" (Perkins, Whitehead, Steptoe 725) and the relative risk of metabolic syndrome was, \"1.7 (95% CI 0.9\u20132.8) for lack of exercise, 1.5 (95% CI 1.1\u20132.1) for a positive family history and 2.0 (95% CI 1.2\u20133.4) in individuals with none or only an elementary school education versus university graduation\" (Lee et al. 48).\n\nInactivity in young people has been seen to be rising in recent years, and the prevalence of sedentary leisure activities for children is significant. Video games and the internet may play a part in this. It has been found that \"26 percent of children and adolescents in the United States spend more than four hours a day watching television, and they have become even more sedentary with access to computers and video games\" (Damlo 1434). Along with, \"62 percent of children nine to thirteen years of age do not participate in organized physical activities, and 23 percent do not participate in non-organized physical activities outside of school hours\" (1434).\n\nThere may be many reasons why people may remain inactive. One reason may be due to laziness. Individuals completed a Physical Activity Questionnaire and research showed \"Over one third (34 percent) of female and 12 percent of male adolescents had no leisure physical activity during a one-week period. Self-efficacy was found to have the highest correlation to leisure physical activity among all selected determinants, while 'laziness' had the highest correlation among perceived barriers\" (Analysis). Along with the questionnaire other research suggested that fitness groups and fitness programs positively altered the exercise behavior of families and youths.\n\nAnother reason for physical inactivity is the perception by populations that there is nowhere safe to do so. As cities become more populated, the increased need for housing overtakes the desire for parks, cycle and walk ways therefore increasing the amount of physical inactivity in the population. Ways that can help increase the amount of physical activity is to plan and build the environment in a way that makes the population of the community feel safe to be physically active in the area. This could be done for example by slowing speed limits to safer speeds and providing safe street crossings and also by building infrastructure close to the street and pathways with safe pedestrian and cycle access and safe bike parking.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/S149940460660211X/1-s2.0-S149940460660211X-main.pdf?_tid=557c0eb6-e426-11e4-bf44-00000aacb35f&acdnat=1429181582_7ab13abe8c50641d83cb170efe11af8b|title = Battling America's Epidemic of Physical Inactivity: Building More Walkable, Livable Communities|last = Fenton|first = Mark|date = December 2005|journal = Journal of Nutrition Education and Behaviour|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-04-16}}</ref> By implementing these simple changes into communities, the residents will have an increased feel in security and therefore increase their daily physical activity.\n\n==Initiatives==\nGiven the social and economic costs of low levels of physical activity there have been a number of public policy initiatives to raise the level, particularly focusing on children and adolescents.\n\n===Fitness portal===\nUnited States government agencies, at both Federal and State levels, have initiated a number of programs which include encouraging workers to bike to work rather than to drive. The Fitness Portal provides a range of tools, examples, and case studies of organization ideas. A few examples given by the Fitness Portal include: using the push mower, going for a walk, taking the stairs instead of an elevator, biking, running errands, visiting friends, cleaning out the garage or the attic, volunteering to become a coach or referee, signing up for a group exercise class, joining a softball league, or parking at the farthest end of the parking lot. For children they suggest: taking a dog for a walk, starting up a kickball game, joining a sports team, going to the park, helping their parents with yard work, playing tag, riding their bike to school, walking to the store, seeing how many jumping jacks they can do, or racing a friend to the end of the block.<ref>http://www.fitness.gov</ref>\n\n===Wellness On Wheels===\nThe Wear Valley District Council along with its local Durham Dales Primary Care Trust in England developed an innovative scheme in an effort to combat the high levels of poor health and obesity in the area. They created a mobile gym with electronic fitness monitoring equipment, which is called \"WOW\" (Wellness on Wheels). This effort was to persuade as many people as possible to enroll in regular workouts as part of a wider campaign in the district. Barry Nelson, a health editor for the ''Northern Echo'', in an interview noted a high level of interest generated. The strategy was to take exercise to people's homes rather than waiting for them to use existing leisure facilities. Children and adults, who otherwise wouldn't have exercised, came out to exercise in the mobile gym. Clearly, from this instance, the availability and nearness of a fitness program in a community positively affected the fitness behavior of the residents. As history explains, twenty-three years ago, Mr. Hackleman was named benefits manager. At this time the county had just three health and fitness programs: blood pressure screenings performed by public health nurses, a tennis tournament and some aerobics classes. However, soon after the roster grew to include at least five preventive health screening programs, eight healthy lifestyle and wellness programs, twelve health improvement and risk reduction programs and five family-life education programs. Finally in 2005, Ms. Gibson documented a total of 3,382 participants in the county's health and fitness programs, or 2,283 individuals, representing 41% of the county's population.\n\n===Walking School Bus===\n{{main|Walking bus}}\n[[File:T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d, Karlovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed, \u0161kolka na p\u0159echodu.jpg|thumb|[[T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d]]-Vnit\u0159n\u00ed M\u011bsto, T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d District, Vyso\u010dina Region, Czechia, Karlovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed]]\n[[File:Restaurace U Li\u0161k\u016f, u vstupu do ZOO Praha, U Trojsk\u00e9ho z\u00e1mku 9, Praha - Troja 01.JPG|thumb|Restaurant U Li\u0161k\u016f, originally a country house, U trojsk\u00e9ho z\u00e1mku str. 35/9 [[Troja (Prague)|Troja]]. At the entrance to the Prague Zoo.]]\nMost research that defends the idea of fitness programs increasing exercise practices among children and adults stems out of San Diego. Heritage Elementary school implemented its first walking school bus. This initiative had students walking to their designated stops, but not waiting for the school bus. Rather, waiting for a train of people on foot to pick them up. This allowed the students to walk to school with their peers. Although it is not directly stated, a major reason children choose to walk is because they fall victim to [[mob mentality]]. Perhaps the phrase, \"fall victim to mob mentality\" has a negative connotation, but that is, in essence, what the children do. Because so many other students were walking, all joined in. In this instance, mob mentality and mass behavior have a positive influence on fitness behavior, and encourage the students to exercise. The opinion of children, teachers and volunteers has been in general very favorable toward the project. Research states, \"91.4 percent of participating students stated they liked the initiative very much and 87.4 percent among them prefer to go to school by the Piedibus than by any other means. Teacher and volunteers outlined the social value of the project and the increase in physical activity as positive aspects of the project\". The group environment of the [[walking bus]] provides comfort in exercising, which in turn leads children to exercise more often. Although not exactly identical to the \"Forrest Gump phenomenon\", this walking school bus exhibits the same results: \"If I can do it, you can do it\".\n\n===Video games===\nSeveral [[video game]] companies have developed ways to mix the two spectrums of electronic and exercise. [[Dance Dance Revolution]], perhaps the most well-known exercise game, had players earn points by dancing to a beat. Players earn more points for tapping dance pads on the dancing platform at precise times and in proper sequences, thereby incorporating physical exercise.\n\nIn 2006 [[Nintendo]] introduced the [[Wii]], a next generation [[game console]] the features a motion sensitive controller. Many players have noticed the benefits of increased physical activity due to playing games on the Wii system, but that does not count as serious exercise.\n\n== Sedentary Behaviour ==\nAccording to Biddle (2007) the social influence of technology, such as electronic gaming and screen time are the main causes towards actions of sedentary behaviour, with TV viewing and computer use being the most prevalent benefactors. However, sedentary behaviours, are not simply \u201copposites\u201d of physical activity, but instead suggests that they \"displace time that would otherwise be used for physical activity\". (Biddle, 2007)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sedentary behaviour|last = Biddle|date = 2007|journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2007.08.002|pmid = |access-date = |volume=33 |issue = 6|pages=502\u2013504}}</ref>\n\nChildren and adolescents, are deemed most at risk for these sedentary behaviours with estimates for youth TV viewing being around \"1.8 - 2.8 hours per day\". Also Biddle (2007) states that for young people \"television took up 40% of the time spent in the five most prevalent sedentary behaviours during the week and 37% at weekends\" which stresses the negative impact of these social and technological advances on physical activity and fitness behaviour.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe study Hardy, Dobbins, Booth, Denney, Wilson and Okely (2006) stated that, \"there are powerful societal inducements to be inactive and there are increasing concerns of an emerging preference among young people to adopt sedentary lifestyles.\" Based on Australian adolescents, results were received which indicated that many young people are engaging in sedentary behaviour, with grade 6's spending 34 hours per week, grade 8's with 41 hours and grade 10's with 45 hours.

The study stated that in the last 20 years (1990-2010), the prevalence of obesity in Australia has more than doubled. It stresses \"public health initiatives targeting the reduction of sedentary pursuits may be necessary to curb the obesity epidemic.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Obesity in Australia: People, politics and prevention|last = Zimmit|date = 2010|journal = Obesity Research|doi = 10.1016/j.orcp.2010.09.168|pmid = |access-date = |volume=4 |pages=S86}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the study Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez, Alfredo Mart\u00ednez, Hu, Gibney, & Kearney, (1999) \"Obesity is the most prevalent nutrition-related problem in Western societies, and it is associated with an important burden of suffering in terms of mortality, morbidity and psychological stress\". The study stresses that people suffering from obesity place a severe burden on health care systems, and that obesity could become the leading public health problem in the next century.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Physical inactivity, sedentary lifestyle and obesity in the European union.|date = 1999|journal = International Journal of Obesity|doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0801049|pmid = |access-date = |volume=23 |issue = 11|pages=1192\u20131201|last1 = Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez|first1 = M. \u00c1.|last2 = Alfredo Mart\u00ednez|first2 = J.|last3 = Hu|first3 = FB|last4 = Gibney|first4 = MJ|last5 = Kearney|first5 = J.}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Health promotion]]\n* [[Healthy diet]]\n* [[Human development (biology)]]\n* [[Human development (psychology)]]\n* [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]\n* [[Personal trainer]]\n* [[Positive psychology]]\n* [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]]\n* [[Sport psychology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* \"An Analysis of Leisure Physical Activity Behaviors and Determinants Among Adolescents in Taiwan.\" EBSCOhost.

It lies on the shore of [[Lake Peipus]] in [[J\u00f5geva County]].  Its population of 1,600 is approximately half Estonian and half [[Russia]]n.  The name of Mustvee was first recorded in 1343 at the time of reign of [[Livonia]]n order.  It became a haven for Russian [[Old Believers]] after the Russian government declared them outlaws in 1658.  Mustvee has held fairs for the past two centuries.  Due to its position at the broadest part of the lake, this traditional fishing town is increasingly popular as a tourist centre. The new [[Harbor of Mustvee]] was opened 18.12.2014.\n\n==List of [[Mayor]]s of Mustvee==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! *\n! Office\n! Name\n!

The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones. The Posidonia Shale is considered to be the reference formation for the Lower Toarcian section.<ref>R\u00f6hl, H. J., & Schmid-R\u00f6hl, A. (2005).

[[Dormettingen]] shales have been calculated biochronologically and with isochron data, giving and approximate age of 183.0 million years old, being close to the [[Pliensbachian]] boundary based on the recent revisions of the Early Jurassic Subperiods.<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/>The Toarcian and the Pliensbachian are considered as strongly constrained in terms of chronology, although that doesn\u00b4t imply that all the formations labelled to one of the two periods have to be limited; for example Lithuanian [[Neringa Formation]] whose upper strata matches with the lowermost Toarcian (183.0).<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/> The rich Shale of the foreland area of the Swabian and Franconian Alb have been recovered as part of the Posidonia, with samples that expose an age between 183.0 to 181.1, thus recovering the Lower Toarcian strata. Although the east margin of the formation has yield strata with an age of 179.7 m.a, showing the presence of the depositional environment on Middle Toarcian times.<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/>\n\n== History ==\nThe Posidonia Shale has been a focus of scientific interest for the last 100 years. There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

A total of 16 illustrations are extant: two sets of six [[watercolour]]s each, and an additional four drawings in pencil. \n\nThe dating of the sets is unknown, as is Blake's intended sequence for the illustrations. The two sets of watercolours are known as the \"Butts set\" and the \"Thomas set\", after their respective patrons, or as the \"Huntington set\" and the \"Whitworth set\" after the [[Huntington Library]] and the [[Whitworth Art Gallery]], which now hold the sets in their collections.\n\n==Provenance==\nThere is little record of the [[provenance]] of the Thomas set or the Butts set before 1852 and 1872, which has led to disputes about the dating. What is known is that the \"Thomas set\" was commissioned by the Reverend Joseph Thomas,<ref name = Butlin389> Butlin 389</ref> who had also commissioned illustrations to Milton's ''[[Comus (poem)|Comus]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' from Blake. No contract for the commission is extant, but the commissioning probably took place in 1809, which is the year in which the illustrations were completed.<ref name = Butlin389 /> Blake was eager to accept the commission, according to G. E. Bentley, because \"Milton illustrations were a kind of work which Blake could not resist.\"<ref>Bentley 2003 p. 357</ref> They presumably stayed in the Revd Thomas's family until they were bought at [[Sotheby's]] from an anonymous seller in 1872. By 1876 they were in the collection of J.E. Taylor, who gave them to the Whitworth in 1892.<ref name = Butlin389 /> \n\nEven less is known about the dates of composition for the \"Butts set\" - between 1811 and 1820, Blake created at least thirty three designs for [[Thomas Butts]], which included the illustrations of ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity''.<ref>Bentley 2003 p. 288</ref> Later, they passed from Butts to his son, who sold them at Sotheby's in 1852, passed through several more hands, were sold at [[Christie's]] in 1912, and in 1916 were sold to [[Henry E. Huntington|Henry Huntington]].<ref> Butlin 393</ref>\n\n[[File:Onthemorningthomas4.jpg|thumb|''The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods'', watercolour, 25 x 19.3 cm, 1809.

Wark, ''Catalogue of William Blake's Drawings and Paintings in the Huntington Library''. First published 1938. Quoted in Butlin, 390</ref>\n\nThe sequence of the illustrations is also a topic of scholarly dispute: the mountings of the Thomas set were inscribed on their backs with numbers 1\u20136, but these were added during or after the 1872 Sotheby's sale, and so are unlikely to follow Blake's intended order.<ref name=Butlin390 />  This \"original\" order ran thus: \n\n#''The Descent of Peace''\n#''The Annunciation to the Shepherds''\n#''The Flight of Moloch''\n#''The Old Dragon''\n#''The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods''\n#''The Night of Peace'' \n\n[[Geoffrey Keynes]] placed them in 1-6-2-3-4-5 order, so that ''The Night of Peace'' followed ''The Descent of Peace'', because of their similar subjects.<ref>Keynes, Geoffrey.

Behrendt adopts a 1-2-5-3-4-6 order, seeing a thematic progression from the destruction of classical aesthetics, to the old testament cruelty of Moloch (who resembles Blake's [[Urizen]]), to [[Satan]] himself.<ref>Behrendt 40-41</ref> This order is followed by Werner in her ''Blake's Vision of the Poetry of Milton''.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:Onthemorningthomas5.jpg|thumb|''The Flight of Moloch'', watercolour, 25.7 x 19.7 cm. 1809]]\nBlake's literary debt to Milton is key to understanding his illustrations of the earlier poet's writings. In general, ''[[Milton: a Poem]]'' is a guide to Blake's idea of Milton: that he possessed true spiritual vision, but fell by his adherence to the moralistic and repressive tenets of [[puritan|puritanism]] and by his preference for the cruel and distant [[Jehovah]] of the [[Old Testament]] over the redemptive figure of [[Christ]]. In that regard the ''Nativity Ode'' is to Blake the rebirth of Milton's poetry into the creative imagination of Christ.<ref>Behrendt 39</ref> Blake also sees a return to prophetic, Christian ideals of poetry, rather than the \"pagan\" [[Classicism|classical aesthetic]] represented in ''The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods'' by the figure of [[Apollo]], who is modeled on the [[Apollo Belvedere]].<ref>Behrendt 40</ref>  \n\nBlake's [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic book]] ''[[Europe: a Prophecy]]'' was especially influenced by ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity''. <ref>Frye 262</ref> In that poem, the messianic [[Orc (Blake)|Orc]], a symbol of pure creative energy, rises against the repressive institutions of Church and state. Orc is part of a doomed cycle- his rebellion is inevitably countered by the increased institutional repression of [[Urizen]].<ref name = Werner117 /> ''Europe'' in that light is seen as a pessimistic parody of Milton's poem.<ref>Werner 115</ref> Orc is often associated with fire, and the closest parallel with him is found in ''The Flight of Moloch'', where a child is about to be given to the [[Moloch|god of sacrifice]]. The similarity of the orifice that frames the child to the shape of the stable in the other illustrations underscores the purpose of Christ's birth, and foreshadows the [[Harrowing of Hell|harrowing of hell]].<ref>Werner 130</ref>    \n\nThe illustrations emphasize the simultaneous occurrence of the events they depict by the presence of the stable in almost every image, and by framing the set with two very similar images that focus on the peaceful victory of Christ over darkness.<ref>Dunbar 92</ref> ''The Descent of Peace'' also has [[Neo-Platonism|neo-platonic]] implications- it represents the descent of the soul into the body, which is symbolized by the cramped stable. <ref>Dunbar 94</ref>\n\n==Table of Illustrations==\nThe order followed here is that given by Butlin.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:0.5em; text-align:center\"\n!

It is part of the [[Holiness Code]] (Leviticus 17\u201326) and its sexual prohibitions are largely paralleled by Leviticus 20, except that chapter has more emphasis on punishment.\n\n== Text ==\nThe original text of Leviticus 18, like that of most of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was written in Hebrew. The oldest extant versions of the text in Hebrew are found in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], and the [[Masoretic Text]]. An ancient Greek translation from the third century BCE, the [[Septuagint]], also exists. Since the addition of chapter divisions in the thirteenth century CE, this [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|chapter]] is divided into 30 verses.\n\nThe chapter begins with God speaking to Moses (verse 1) and giving him a message for the Israelites (2), warning them to keep God's laws rather than Canaanite or Egyptian practices (3\u20135). Then follows a list of people with whom sex is forbidden due to family relationships (6\u201319). Verse 20 prohibits sexual relations with a neighbor's wife, and 21 prohibits passing one's children through fire to [[Moloch]]. 22 is the famous verse about \"lying with a man,\" discussed below, while 23 forbids bestiality. The final verses (24\u201330) warn that breaking these laws will produce defilement and that the [[Canaanites]] are about to be displaced from the land of [[Canaan]] as a result of following these practices, and warn of a similar fate for the Israelites if they fall into these practices.\n\n==Incest==\n{{Main|Incest in the Bible}}\n\nThe Bible lists several types of relationship which it regards as incestuous unions; one list appears in the [[Deuteronomic Code]], and two lists occur in the [[Holiness Code]] of [[Leviticus]]. These lists only mention relationships with female relatives; excluding [[lesbianism]], which implies that the list is addressed to men. These lists then compare as follows: \n\n(blue = forbidden for men only, pink = forbidden for women only, purple = forbidden for both men and women):\n\n{|border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"| ||Leviticus 18||Leviticus 20||Deuteronomy\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Grandparent's spouse (including other grandparent)||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| || ||\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Parent's spouse||Parent||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| || ||rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"|\n|-\n|Stepparent||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| ||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Parent-in-law||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| ||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| ||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Uncle/Aunt||colspan=\"2\"|Parent's sibling||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| ||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Uncle's/Aunt's Spouse||Father's sibling's spouse||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| ||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| ||\n|-\n|Mother's sibling's spouse||colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Parent's child||colspan=\"2\"|Half-Sibling (mother's side)|| || ||rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Father's child||Sibling||rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| ||\n|-\n|Half-Sibling (father's side)||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Step sibling||colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Sibling-in-law (if the spouse was still alive)||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| || ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Nephew/Niece||colspan=\"2\"|Sibling's child||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| ||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Nephew/Niece-in-law||Spouse's Brother's Child||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| ||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| ||\n|-\n|Spouse's Sister's Child||colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Spouse's child||Child||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| || ||rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"|\n|-\n|Stepchild||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| ||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Child-in-law||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| ||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| ||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Spouse's grandchild (including grandchild)||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| || ||\n|-\n|}\n\nOne feature of all the lists is that sexual activity between a man and his daughter is not explicitly forbidden. The [[Talmud]] argues that this is because the prohibition was ''obvious'', especially given the proscription against a relationship with a granddaughter.<ref>Yebamot 3a</ref>  The shortness of the list in Leviticus 20, and especially of that in Deuteronomy, is explained by classical Jewish scholarship as being due to the ''obviousness'' of the missing prohibitions.<ref name=\"JewEncInce\">''Jewish Encyclopedia'', s.v. ''Incest''</ref><ref>[[Samuel ben Meir]], ''Commentary'', ad loc.</ref> The explicit prohibition against engaging in sexual activity with \"both a woman and her daughter\",<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:17|}}</ref> implicitly forbids sexual activity between a man and his daughter. Some [[biblical criticism|biblical scholars]] have instead proposed that it was originally in the list but was then accidentally left out from the copy on which modern versions of the text ultimately depend, due to a mistake by the scribe.<ref name=\"EncBibChoice\">Cheyne and Black, Encyclopaedia Biblica, ''Marriage : choice of bride''</ref>\n\nApart from the questionable case of a man marrying his daughter, the list in Leviticus 18 roughly produces the same rules as were followed in early [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabic]] culture.<ref name=\"JewEncInce\" /> However, most tribal nations also disliked [[exogamy|exogamous]] marriage\u2014marriage to completely unrelated people.<ref name=\"JewEncInce\" /> In several prominent cases in the Torah, the incest rules are ignored in favour of marriage to a close relative; [[Jacob]] is described as having married his first wife's sister,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:16|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:23|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:28|}}</ref> and [[Abraham]] as having a father in common with [[Sarah]]<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|20:12|}}</ref> (rather than a mother, which would have been permitted by the list).

These lists then compare as follows: \n\n(blue = forbidden for men only, pink = forbidden for women only, purple = forbidden for both men and women):\n\n{|border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"| ||Leviticus 18||Leviticus 20||Deuteronomy\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Grandparent's spouse (including other grandparent)||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| || ||\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Parent's spouse||Parent||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| || ||rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"|\n|-\n|Stepparent||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| ||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Parent-in-law||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| ||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| ||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Uncle/Aunt||colspan=\"2\"|Parent's sibling||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| ||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Uncle's/Aunt's Spouse||Father's sibling's spouse||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| ||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| ||\n|-\n|Mother's sibling's spouse||colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Parent's child||colspan=\"2\"|Half-Sibling (mother's side)|| || ||rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Father's child||Sibling||rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| ||\n|-\n|Half-Sibling (father's side)||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Step sibling||colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Sibling-in-law (if the spouse was still alive)||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| || ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Nephew/Niece||colspan=\"2\"|Sibling's child||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| ||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Nephew/Niece-in-law||Spouse's Brother's Child||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| ||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| ||\n|-\n|Spouse's Sister's Child||colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Spouse's child||Child||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"| || ||rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"|\n|-\n|Stepchild||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| ||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Child-in-law||style=\"background-color:#4c387f\"| ||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| ||style=\"background-color:#FF70B8\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Spouse's grandchild (including grandchild)||style=\"background-color:#6090FF\"| || ||\n|-\n|}\n\nOne feature of all the lists is that sexual activity between a man and his daughter is not explicitly forbidden. The [[Talmud]] argues that this is because the prohibition was ''obvious'', especially given the proscription against a relationship with a granddaughter.<ref>Yebamot 3a</ref>  The shortness of the list in Leviticus 20, and especially of that in Deuteronomy, is explained by classical Jewish scholarship as being due to the ''obviousness'' of the missing prohibitions.<ref name=\"JewEncInce\">''Jewish Encyclopedia'', s.v. ''Incest''</ref><ref>[[Samuel ben Meir]], ''Commentary'', ad loc.</ref> The explicit prohibition against engaging in sexual activity with \"both a woman and her daughter\",<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:17|}}</ref> implicitly forbids sexual activity between a man and his daughter. Some [[biblical criticism|biblical scholars]] have instead proposed that it was originally in the list but was then accidentally left out from the copy on which modern versions of the text ultimately depend, due to a mistake by the scribe.<ref name=\"EncBibChoice\">Cheyne and Black, Encyclopaedia Biblica, ''Marriage : choice of bride''</ref>\n\nApart from the questionable case of a man marrying his daughter, the list in Leviticus 18 roughly produces the same rules as were followed in early [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabic]] culture.<ref name=\"JewEncInce\" /> However, most tribal nations also disliked [[exogamy|exogamous]] marriage\u2014marriage to completely unrelated people.<ref name=\"JewEncInce\" /> In several prominent cases in the Torah, the incest rules are ignored in favour of marriage to a close relative; [[Jacob]] is described as having married his first wife's sister,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:16|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:23|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:28|}}</ref> and [[Abraham]] as having a father in common with [[Sarah]]<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|20:12|}}</ref> (rather than a mother, which would have been permitted by the list).

Achievement Award and toured extensively around Canada with others, like Thrush Hermit and the Weakerthans.
