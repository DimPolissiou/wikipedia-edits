T., Koehnke S. S. (2016): On the nature of creepiness, New Ideas in Psychology, Vol.4</ref> investigated the characteristics that make people creepy. Creepy people were thought to be more often male than female by an overwhelming majority of participants (around 95% of both males and females participants).<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|12}}  Another study conducted by Watt et al. also found that participants associated the [[ectomorphic]] body type (more linear) with creepiness, more than the other two body types (51% vs [[mesomorphic]], 24% and [[endomorphic]], 23%). Other cues of creepiness included low hygiene, especially according to female participants, and a dishevelled appearance .  Participants also identified the face as an area with potentially creepy features: in particular the eyes and the teeth.  Both of those physical features were deemed creepy not only for their unpleasant appearance (ex. squinty eyes or crooked teeth) but also for the movements and expressions they engaged it (ex. darting eye movements and odd smiles).<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|61}}  \n\nIn fact, appearance doesn\u2019t seem to be the only factor making an individual creepy: behaviours provide cues as well.<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|58}} Behaviours such as \u201cbeing unusually quiet and staring (34%), following or lurking (15%), behaving abnormally (21%), or in a socially awkward, \"sketchy\" or suspicious way (20%)\u201d are all contributing to a feeling of creepiness, as described by Watt et al.\u2019s study.<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|61}}\n  \n\n\n=== Technology ===\nIn addition to other individuals, new technologies, such as marketing\u2019s targeted ads and AI, have been qualified as creepy.\n\nA study by Moore et al <ref name=\"Moore\">Moore R. S., Moore M. L., Shanahan K. J., Horky A., Mack B.(2015): Creepy marketing: three dimensions of perceived excessive online privacy violation, Marketing Management Journal, Vol.25</ref> described what aspect of marketing participants considered creepy. The main three reasons are the following: using invasive tactics, causing discomfort and violating of norms. Invasive tactics are practiced by marketers that know so much about the consumer that the ads are \u201ccreepily\u201d personalised. Secondly, some ads create discomfort by making the consumer question \u201cthe motives of the company advertising the product\u201d . Finally, some ads violate social norms by having inappropriate content, for example by unnecessarily sexualizing it.<ref name=\"Moore\" />{{rp|48}}\nIt is marketing\u2019s extensive knowledge used in an improper way that creates a feeling of creepiness, together with a certain loss of control over our data. <ref name=\"Moore\" />{{rp|44}} \n\nAnother creepy aspect of technology is human looking AI: this phenomenon is called the [[uncanny valley]].\nHumans find robots creepy when they start resembling humans excessively. It has been hypothesised that the reason why they are viewed as creepy is because they violate our notion of how a robot should look. A study focusing on children's responses to this phenomenon found evidence to support the hypothesis.<ref>Brink K. A., Gray K. and Wellman H.M. (2019): Creepiness Creeps In: Uncanny Valley Feelings Are Acquired in Childhood, Child Dev, Vol.90</ref>{{rp|1210}}\n\n\n\n\n==Evolutionary explanation==\nSeveral studies have hypothesized that creepiness is an evolutionary response to potentially dangerous situations.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|10}}   It could be linked to a mechanism called [[agency detection]] which makes individuals expect malignant agents to be responsible for small changes in our environment. McAndrew et al. illustrates the idea with the example of a person hearing some noises while walking in a dark alley. That person would go in high alert, fearing that some dangerous individual was there. If that wasn\u2019t the case the loss would be small. If, on the other hand, a dangerous individual was actually in the alley and the person had not been alerted by this creepy feeling, the loss could have been significant.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|11}} \n\nCreepiness would therefore serve the purpose of alerting us in situations in which the danger isn\u2019t outright obvious but rather ambiguous. In this case, ambiguity both refers to the possible presence of a threat and to its nature, sexual or physical for example.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|10}} Creepiness \u201cmay reside in between the unknowing and the fear\u201d<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|58}} in the sense that individuals experiencing it are unsure if there truly is something to fear or not. Truth is that creepy characteristics are not simply caused by threat potential: in fact, [[ectomorphic]] body types are not the most powerful bodies and facial expressions are not a proxy of physical strength either.<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|63}} Therefore, creepiness isn\u2019t only related to how threatening a characteristic is, in the sense of how dangerous and strong the individual can be. There are more facets to consider.\n\nAnother characteristic of creepiness is unpredictable behaviour.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|12}} Unpredictability links back to this idea of ambiguity.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|11}} When an individual is unpredictable it isn\u2019t possible to tell when his behaviour will turn violent: this adds to the ambiguity of a potentially dangerous situation. This theory is endorsed by studies. Not only is unpredictability directly listed as a creepy characteristic<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|13}}, but other behaviours, such as norm-breaking behaviours are indirectly linked with unpredictability. Such behaviours show that the individual doesn\u2019t conform to some social standards we would expect in a given situation. <ref name=\"Leander\">Leander N. P., Chartrand T. L., Bargh J. A. (2012): You give me the chills: Embodied reactions to inappropriate amounts of behavioral mimicry, Psychological Science, Vol.23</ref>{{rp|773}}  For example, we previously mentioned staring at strangers or lack of hygiene: those are behaviours that make us uneasy, creeped out, because they don\u2019t fit the norm and therefore we don\u2019t expect them. More generally, participants tended to define creepiness as \u201cdifferent\u201d in the sense of not behaving, or looking, socially acceptable.<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|62}} Such differences point towards a \u201csocial mismatch\u201d.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|10}} \n\nHumans have a natural system of detection of such mismatch: a physical feeling of coldness.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|10}} When an individual is creeped out, they report feeling those \u201ccold chills\u201d.

With the establishment of the Turkish Republic, in 1923 the capital of [[Turkey]] was moved to [[Ankara]] and the original Roman Empire name Constantinople was officially changed to the Turkish name [[Istanbul]]; the city is still referred to as Constantinople in Greek-speaking sources. The original city is located in what is now the European side and the core of modern Istanbul.\n\nIn 324 the ancient city of [[Byzantium]] became the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor [[Constantine the Great]], after whom it was renamed, and dedicated on 11 May 330.<ref name=\"ODB\">{{ODB | title=Constantinople | last = Mango | first = Cyril | authorlink = Cyril Mango | pages = 508\u2013512}}</ref> From the mid-5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe.<ref>Pounds, Norman John Greville.

The first wall of the city was erected by [[Constantine I]], and surrounded the city on both land and sea fronts. Later, in the 5th century, the [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Anthemius (praetorian prefect)|Anthemius]] under the child emperor [[Theodosius II]] undertook the construction of the [[Theodosian Walls]], which consisted of a double wall lying about {{convert|2|km||abbr=out}} to the west of the first wall and a moat with palisades in front.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A History of Byzantine State and Society|last = Treadgold|first = Warren|publisher = Stanford University Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Stanford, CA|page = 89}}</ref> This formidable complex of defences was one of the most sophisticated of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]. The city was built intentionally to rival Rome, and it was claimed that several elevations within its walls matched the 'seven hills' of Rome. Because it was located between the [[Golden Horn]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]] the land area that needed defensive walls was reduced, and this helped it to present an impregnable fortress enclosing magnificent palaces, domes, and towers, the result of the prosperity it achieved from being the gateway between two continents (Europe and Asia) and two seas (the Mediterranean and the Black Sea). Although besieged on numerous occasions by various armies, the defences of Constantinople proved impregnable for nearly nine hundred years.\n\nIn 1204, however, the armies of the [[Fourth Crusade]] took and devastated the city, and its inhabitants lived several decades under Latin misrule.  In 1261 the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] liberated the city, and after the restoration under the [[Palaiologos]] dynasty, enjoyed a partial recovery.  With the advent of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1299, the Byzantine Empire began to lose territories and the city began to lose population. By the early 15th century, the Byzantine Empire was reduced to just Constantinople and its environs, along with [[Morea]] in Greece, making it an enclave inside the Ottoman Empire; after a 53-day siege the city eventually [[fall of Constantinople|fell to the Ottomans]], led by [[Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], on 29 May 1453,<ref name=\"mw28\">M\u00fcller-Wiener (1977), p. 28</ref> whereafter it replaced [[Edirne]] (Adrianople) as the new capital of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Rosenberg, Matt. \"Largest cities through history.\" About.com.</ref>\n\n== Names ==\n\n=== Before Constantinople ===\nAccording to [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', the first known name of a settlement on the site of Constantinople was ''Lygos'',<ref>[http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20IV ''Pliny the Elder'', book IV, chapter XI]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm |date=2017-01-01 }}.

This is the first major settlement that would develop on the site of later Constantinople, but the first known settlements was that of ''Lygos'', referred to in Pliny's Natural Histories.<ref>Pliny, IV, xi</ref> Apart from this, little is known about this initial settlement. The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium ({{lang|grc|\u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd|Byz\u00e1ntion}}) in around 657&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"IA\" /> across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\n\nThe city maintained independence as a city-state until it was annexed by [[Darius I]] in 512&nbsp;BC into the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], who saw the site as the optimal location to construct a [[pontoon bridge]] crossing into Europe as Byzantium was situated at the narrowest point in the Bosphorus strait. Persian rule lasted until 478&nbsp;BC when as part of the Greek counterattack to the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]], a Greek army led by the Spartan general [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]] captured the city which remained an independent, yet subordinate, city under the Athenians, and later to the Spartans after 411&nbsp;BC.<ref>Thucydides, I, 94</ref> A farsighted treaty with the emergent power of Rome in {{circa|150 BC}} which stipulated tribute in exchange for independent status allowed it to enter Roman rule unscathed.<ref>Harris, 2007, pp. 24\u201325</ref> This treaty would pay dividends retrospectively as Byzantium would maintain this independent status, and prosper under peace and stability in the [[Pax Romana]], for nearly three centuries until the late 2nd century AD.<ref>Harris, 2007, p. 45</ref>\n\nByzantium was never a major influential city-state like that of [[Athens]], [[Corinth]] or [[Sparta]], but the city enjoyed relative peace and steady growth as a prosperous trading city lent by its remarkable position. The site lay astride the land route from [[Europe]] to [[Asia]] and the [[Turkish Straits|seaway]] from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean]], and had in the [[Golden Horn]] an excellent and spacious harbour. Already then, in Greek and early Roman times, Byzantium was famous for its strategic geographic position that made it difficult to besiege and capture, and its position at the crossroads of the Asiatic-European trade route over land and as the gateway between the Mediterranean and Black Seas made it too valuable a settlement to abandon, as Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] later realized when he razed the city to the ground for supporting [[Pescennius Niger]]'s [[Year of the Five Emperors|claimancy]].<ref>Harris, 2007, pp. 44\u201345</ref> It was a move greatly criticized by the contemporary consul and historian [[Cassius Dio]] who said that Severus had destroyed \"a strong Roman outpost and a base of operations against the barbarians from Pontus and Asia\".<ref>Cassius Dio, ix, p. 195</ref> He would later rebuild Byzantium towards the end of his reign, in which it would be briefly renamed ''Augusta Antonina'', fortifying it with a new city wall in his name, the Severan Wall.\n\n=== 324\u2013337: Foundation of Constantinople ===\n[[File:Constantine I Hagia Sophia.jpg|right|thumb|Emperor [[Constantine I]] presents a representation of the city of Constantinople as tribute to an enthroned Mary and Christ Child in this church mosaic.

Having restored the unity of the Empire, and, being in the course of major governmental reforms as well as of [[Constantine I and Christianity|sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church]], he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital. Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians. Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location. Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site of Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the [[Danube]] or the [[Euphrates]] frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire.\n\nConstantinople was built over six years, and consecrated on 11 May 330.<ref name=ODB /><ref>Commemorative coins that were issued during the 330s already refer to the city as ''Constantinopolis'' (see, e.g., Michael Grant, ''The climax of Rome'' (London 1968), p. 133), or \"Constantine's City\". According to the ''Reallexikon f\u00fcr Antike und Christentum'', vol. 164 (Stuttgart 2005), column 442, there is no evidence for the tradition that Constantine officially dubbed the city \"New Rome\" (''Nova Roma''). It is possible that the Emperor called the city \"Second Rome\" ({{lang-grc|\u0394\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u1fec\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7}}, ''Deutera Rh\u014dm\u0113'') by official decree, as reported by the 5th-century church historian [[Socrates of Constantinople]]: See [[Names of Constantinople]].</ref> Constantine divided the expanded city, like Rome, into 14 regions, and ornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis.<ref>A description can be found in the [[Notitia urbis Constantinopolitanae]].</ref> Yet, at first, Constantine's new Rome did not have all the dignities of old Rome. It possessed a [[proconsul]], rather than an [[urban prefect]]. It had no [[praetors]], [[tribunes]], or [[quaestors]]. Although it did have senators, they held the title ''clarus'', not ''[[clarissimus]]'', like those of Rome. It also lacked the panoply of other administrative offices regulating the food supply, police, statues, temples, sewers, aqueducts, or other public works. The new programme of building was carried out in great haste: columns, marbles, doors, and tiles were taken wholesale from the temples of the empire and moved to the new city. In similar fashion, many of the greatest works of Greek and Roman art were soon to be seen in its squares and streets. The emperor stimulated private building by promising householders gifts of land from the imperial estates in [[Diocese of Asia|Asiana]] and [[Diocese of Pontus|Pontica]] and on 18 May 332 he announced that, as in Rome, free distributions of food would be made to the citizens. At the time, the amount is said to have been 80,000 rations a day, doled out from 117 distribution points around the city.<ref>Socrates II.13, cited by J B Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, p. 74.</ref>\n\nConstantine laid out a new square at the centre of old Byzantium, naming it the [[Augustaion|Augustaeum]]. The new senate-house (or Curia) was housed in a basilica on the east side. On the south side of the great square was erected the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]] of the Emperor with its imposing entrance, the [[Chalke]], and its ceremonial suite known as the [[Daphne Palace|Palace of Daphne]]. Nearby was the vast [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]] for chariot-races, seating over 80,000 spectators, and the famed [[Baths of Zeuxippus]]. At the western entrance to the Augustaeum was the [[Milion]], a vaulted monument from which distances were measured across the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nFrom the Augustaeum led a great street, the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]] ({{lang-grc-gre|\u039c\u03ad\u03c3\u03b7 [\u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2]||\"Middle [Street]\"}}), lined with colonnades. As it descended the First Hill of the city and climbed the Second Hill, it passed on the left the [[Praetorium]] or law-court. Then it passed through the oval [[Forum of Constantine]] where there was a second Senate-house and a [[Column of Constantine|high column]] with a statue of Constantine himself in the guise of [[Helios]], crowned with a halo of seven rays and looking toward the rising sun. From there, the Mese passed on and through the [[Forum Tauri]] and then the [[Forum Bovis]], and finally up the Seventh Hill (or Xerolophus) and through to the Golden Gate in the [[Wall of Constantine (Constantinople)|Constantinian Wall]]. After the construction of the [[Theodosian Walls]] in the early 5th century, it was extended to the new [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], reaching a total length of seven [[Roman mile]]s.<ref>J B Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, p. 75.

From the death of Constantine in 337 to the accession of Theodosius I, emperors had been resident only in the years 337\u2013338, 347\u2013351, 358\u2013361, 368\u2013369. Its status as a capital was recognized by the appointment of the first known Urban Prefect of the City Honoratus, who held office from 11 December 359 until 361. The urban prefects had concurrent jurisdiction over three provinces each in the adjacent dioceses of Thrace (in which the city was located), Pontus and Asia comparable to the 100-mile extraordinary jurisdiction of the prefect of Rome. The emperor [[Valens]], who hated the city and spent only one year there, nevertheless built the Palace of [[Hebdomon]] on the shore of the [[Sea of Marmara|Propontis]] near the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], probably for use when reviewing troops. All the emperors up to [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and [[Basiliscus]] were crowned and acclaimed at the Hebdomon. [[Theodosius I]] founded the [[Studion|Church of John the Baptist]] to house the skull of the saint (today preserved at the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]]), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned the ruined temple of [[Aphrodite]] into a coach house for the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian Prefect]]; [[Arcadius]] built a new forum named after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.\n\nAfter the shock of the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, in which the emperor [[Valens]] with the flower of the Roman armies was destroyed by the [[Visigoths]] within a few days' march, the city looked to its defences, and in 413\u2013414 [[Theodosius II]] built the 18-metre (60-foot)-tall [[Walls of Constantinople|triple-wall fortifications]], which were not to be breached until the coming of gunpowder. Theodosius also founded a [[University of Constantinople|University]] near the Forum of Taurus, on 27 February 425.\n\n[[Uldin]], a prince of the [[Huns]], appeared on the Danube about this time and advanced into Thrace, but he was deserted by many of his followers, who joined with the Romans in driving their king back north of the river. Subsequent to this, new walls were built to defend the city and the fleet on the Danube improved.\n\nAfter the [[barbarian]]s overran the Western Roman Empire, Constantinople became the indisputable capital city of the Roman Empire. Emperors were no longer peripatetic between various court capitals and palaces. They remained in their palace in the Great City and sent generals to command their armies. The wealth of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia flowed into Constantinople.\n\n=== 527\u2013565: Constantinople in the Age of Justinian ===\n[[File:Map of Constantinople (1422) by Florentine cartographer Cristoforo Buondelmonte.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|Map of Constantinople (1422) by Florentine cartographer [[Cristoforo Buondelmonti]]<ref>''Liber insularum Archipelagi'', [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], Paris.</ref> is the oldest surviving map of the city, and the only one that predates the Turkish conquest of the city in 1453.]]\n[[File:Hagia Sophia Mars 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|The current [[Hagia Sophia]] was commissioned by Emperor [[Justinian I]] after the previous one was destroyed in the [[Nika riots]] of 532.

It was from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former Diocese of Africa set sail on or about 21 June 533. Before their departure, the ship of the commander [[Belisarius]] was anchored in front of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise. After the victory, in 534, the [[Herod's Temple|Temple treasure of Jerusalem]], looted by the Romans in [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|AD&nbsp;70]] and taken to [[Carthage]] by the [[Vandals]] after their sack of Rome in 455, was brought to Constantinople and deposited for a time, perhaps in the [[Church of St. Polyeuctus]], before being returned to [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] in either the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Church of the Resurrection]] or the New Church.<ref>Margaret Barker, Times Literary Supplement 4 May 2007, p. 26.</ref>\n\nChariot-racing had been important in Rome for centuries. In Constantinople, the hippodrome became over time increasingly a place of political significance. It was where (as a shadow of the popular elections of old Rome) the people by acclamation showed their approval of a new emperor, and also where they openly criticized the government, or clamoured for the removal of unpopular ministers. In the time of Justinian, public order in Constantinople became a critical political issue.\n\nThroughout the late Roman and early Byzantine periods, Christianity was resolving fundamental questions of identity, and the dispute between the [[Chalcedonian Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and the [[monophysites]] became the cause of serious disorder, expressed through allegiance to the horse-racing parties of the Blues and the Greens. The partisans of the Blues and the Greens were said<ref>Procopius' '' Secret History'': see P Neville-Ure, Justinian and his Age, 1951.</ref> to affect untrimmed facial hair, head hair shaved at the front and grown long at the back, and wide-sleeved tunics tight at the wrist; and to form gangs to engage in night-time muggings and street violence. At last these disorders took the form of a major rebellion of 532, known as the [[Nika riots|\"Nika\" riots]] (from the battle-cry of \"Conquer!\" of those involved).<ref>James Grout: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/circusmaximus/nika.html \"The Nika Riot\"], part of the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Romana''</ref>\n\nFires started by the Nika rioters consumed Constantine's basilica of Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom), the city's principal church, which lay to the north of the Augustaeum. Justinian commissioned [[Anthemius of Tralles]] and [[Isidore of Miletus]] to replace it with a new and incomparable [[Hagia Sophia]]. This was the great cathedral of the Orthodox Church, whose dome was said to be held aloft by God alone, and which was directly connected to the palace so that the imperial family could attend services without passing through the streets.<ref>Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of the city, and is now a museum.</ref> The dedication took place on 26 December 537 in the presence of the emperor, who exclaimed, \"O [[Solomon's Temple|Solomon]], I have outdone thee!\"<ref>Source for quote: ''Scriptores originum Constantinopolitanarum'', ed T Preger I 105 (see [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|A.

Madden, ''Crusades: The Illustrated History'', 114.</ref>\n\nJustinian also had Anthemius and Isidore demolish and replace the original Church of the Holy Apostles built by Constantine with a [[Church of the Holy Apostles|new church]] under the same dedication. This was designed in the form of an equal-armed cross with five domes, and ornamented with beautiful mosaics.

These controversies contributed to the deterioration of relations between the [[Roman Catholic|Western]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] Churches.\n\n=== 1025\u20131081: Constantinople after Basil II ===\nIn the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous defeat of the imperial armies at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in Armenia in 1071. The Emperor [[Romanos IV|Romanus]] Diogenes was captured. The peace terms demanded by [[Alp Arslan]], sultan of the Seljuk Turks, were not excessive, and Romanus accepted them. On his release, however, Romanus found that enemies had placed their own candidate on the throne in his absence; he surrendered to them and suffered death by torture, and the new ruler, [[Michael VII]] Ducas, refused to honour the treaty. In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073. The collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition, and the empire's resources were distracted and squandered in a series of civil wars. Thousands of [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia. By 1080, a huge area had been lost to the Empire, and the Turks were within striking distance of Constantinople.\n\n=== 1081\u20131185: Constantinople under the Comneni ===\n[[File:Byzantium@1180.jpg|thumb|The [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel I]], {{circa|1180}}.]]\n[[File:Istanbul 2009 Comnenus Mosaics.JPG|thumb|12th century [[mosaic]] from the upper gallery of the [[Hagia Sophia]], Constantinople.

The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th century vary from some 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the realm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of money in circulation dramatically increased. This was reflected in Constantinople by the construction of the Blachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general prosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of the Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is certain that the [[Venice|Venetians]] and others were active traders in Constantinople, making a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of [[Outremer]] and the West, while also trading extensively with Byzantium and [[Egypt]]. The Venetians had factories on the north side of the Golden Horn, and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century. Toward the end of [[Manuel I Komnenos]]'s reign, the number of foreigners in the city reached about 60,000\u201380,000 people out of a total population of about 400,000 people.<ref name=\"popu\">J.

There was a revival in the [[mosaic]] art, for example: Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. There was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work. According to N.H. Baynes (''Byzantium, An Introduction to East Roman Civilization''):\n{{blockquote|\nWith its love of luxury and passion for colour, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the whole of the Christian world. Beautiful silks from the workshops of Constantinople also portrayed in dazzling colour animals \u2013 lions, elephants, eagles, and griffins \u2013 confronting each other, or represented Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase.\n\nFrom the tenth to the twelfth century Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. By their style, arrangement, and iconography the mosaics of St. Mark's at Venice and of the cathedral at [[Torcello]] clearly reveal their Byzantine origin. Similarly those of the [[Cappella Palatina|Palatine Chapel]], the [[Martorana]] at [[Palermo]], and the [[cathedral of Cefal\u00f9]], together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at Monreale, demonstrate the influence of Byzantium on the [[italo-Normans|Norman]] Court of [[Sicily]] in the twelfth century. Hispano-[[Moorish]] art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. [[Romanesque art]] owes much to the East, from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings, as is proved, for instance, by the domed churches of south-western France. Princes of [[Kiev]], [[doge of Venice|Venetian doges]], abbots of [[Monte Cassino]], merchants of [[Amalfi]], and the kings of Sicily all looked to Byzantium for artists or works of art. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the twelfth century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centres dedicated to its production.\"}}\n\n=== 1185\u20131261: Constantinople during the Imperial Exile ===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 012.jpg|thumb|right|''The Entry of the [[Crusade]]rs into Constantinople'', by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], 1840.]]\n[[File:Byzantium1204.png|thumb|The [[Latin Empire]], [[Empire of Nicaea]], [[Empire of Trebizond]], and the [[Despotate of Epirus]].

In the course of a plot between [[Philip of Swabia]], [[Boniface of Montferrat]] and the [[Enrico Dandolo|Doge of Venice]], the [[Fourth Crusade]] was, despite papal excommunication, diverted in 1203 against Constantinople, ostensibly promoting the claims of Alexius, son of the deposed emperor Isaac. The reigning emperor Alexius III had made no preparation. The Crusaders occupied [[Galata]], broke the [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] protecting the [[Golden Horn]], and entered the harbour, where on 27 July they breached the sea walls: Alexius III fled. But the new [[Alexius IV]] found the Treasury inadequate, and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his western allies. Tension between the citizens and the Latin soldiers increased. In January 1204, the ''[[protovestiarius]]'' Alexius Murzuphlus provoked a riot, it is presumed, to intimidate Alexius IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of Athena, the work of [[Phidias]], which stood in the principal forum facing west.\n\nIn February 1204, the people rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed, and Murzuphlus took the purple as [[Alexius V]]. He made some attempt to repair the walls and organise the citizenry, but there had been no opportunity to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April failed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the invaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in Hagia Sophia and offered the crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, but it was too late. He came out with the Patriarch to the [[Milion|Golden Milestone]] before the Great Palace and addressed the Varangian Guard. Then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility and embarked for Asia. By the next day the Doge and the leading Franks were installed in the Great Palace, and the city was given over to pillage for three days.\n\n[[Sir Steven Runciman]], historian of the Crusades, wrote that the sack of Constantinople is \"unparalleled in history\".\n\n{{quote|For nine centuries, [...] the great city had been the capital of Christian civilisation. It was filled with works of art that had survived from ancient Greece and with the masterpieces of its own exquisite craftsmen. The Venetians [...] seized treasures and carried them off to adorn [...] their town. But the Frenchmen and Flemings were filled with a lust for destruction. They rushed in a howling mob down the streets and through the houses, snatching up everything that glittered and destroying whatever they could not carry, pausing only to murder or to rape, or to break open the wine-cellars [...] . Neither monasteries nor churches nor libraries were spared. In Hagia Sophia itself, drunken soldiers could be seen tearing down the silken hangings and pulling the great silver [[iconostasis]] to pieces, while sacred books and icons were trampled under foot. While they drank merrily from the altar-vessels a prostitute set herself on the Patriarch's throne and began to sing a ribald French song. Nuns were ravished in their convents. Palaces and hovels alike were entered and wrecked. Wounded women and children lay dying in the streets. For three days the ghastly scenes [...] continued, till the huge and beautiful city was a shambles. [...] When [...] order was restored, [...] citizens were tortured to make them reveal the goods that they had contrived to hide.<ref>Steven Runciman, ''A History of the Crusades'', Cambridge 1966 [1954], vol 3, p. 123.</ref>}}\n\nFor the next half-century, Constantinople was the seat of the [[Latin Empire]]. Under the rulers of the Latin Empire, the city declined, both in population and the condition of its buildings. Alice-Mary Talbot cites an estimated population for Constantinople of 400,000 inhabitants; after the destruction wrought by the Crusaders on the city, about one third were homeless, and numerous courtiers, nobility, and higher clergy, followed various leading personages into exile. \"As a result Constantinople became seriously depopulated,\" Talbot concludes.<ref>Talbot, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291680 \"The Restoration of Constantinople under Michael VIII\"], ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', '''47''' (1993), p. 246</ref>\n\nThe Latins took over at least 20 churches and 13 monasteries, most prominently the Hagia Sophia, which became the cathedral of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. It is to these that E.H. Swift attributed the construction of a series of flying buttresses to shore up the walls of the church, which had been weakened over the centuries by earthquake tremors.<ref>Talbot, \"Restoration of Constantinople\", p. 247</ref> However, this act of maintenance is an exception: for the most part, the Latin occupiers were too few to maintain all of the buildings, either secular and sacred, and many became targets for vandalism or dismantling. Bronze and lead were removed from the roofs of abandoned buildings and melted down and sold to provide money to the chronically under-funded Empire for defense and to support the court; Deno John Geanokoplos writes that \"it may well be that a division is suggested here: Latin laymen stripped secular buildings, ecclesiastics, the churches.\"<ref>Geanakoplos, ''Emperor Michael Palaeologus and the West'' (Harvard University Press, 1959), p. 124 n. 26</ref> Buildings were not the only targets of officials looking to raise funds for the impoverished Latin Empire: the monumental sculptures which adorned the Hippodrome and fora of the city were pulled down and melted for coinage. \"Among the masterpieces destroyed, writes Talbot, \"were a Herakles attributed to the fourth-century B.C. sculptor [[Lysippos]], and monumental figures of Hera, Paris, and Helen.\"<ref name=\"Talbot-248\">Talbot, \"Restoration of Constantinople\", p. 248</ref>\n\nThe Nicaean emperor [[John III Vatatzes]] reportedly saved several churches from being dismantled for their valuable building materials; by sending money to the Latins \"to buy them off\" (''exonesamenos''), he prevented the destruction of several churches.<ref>Geanakoplos, ''Emperor Michael'', p. 124</ref> According to Talbot, these included the churches of Blachernae, [[Rouphinianai]], and St. Michael at Anaplous.

It would remain the capital of the eastern, Greek-speaking empire for over a thousand years. At its peak, roughly corresponding to the Middle Ages, it was the richest and largest European city, exerting a powerful cultural pull and dominating economic life in the Mediterranean. Visitors and merchants were especially struck by the beautiful monasteries and churches of the city, in particular the [[Hagia Sophia]], or the Church of Holy Wisdom. According to Russian 14th-century traveler Stephen of Novgorod: \"As for Hagia Sophia, the human mind can neither tell it nor make description of it.\"\n\nIt was especially important for preserving in its libraries manuscripts of Greek and Latin authors throughout a period when instability and disorder caused their mass-destruction in western Europe and north Africa: On the city's fall, thousands of these were brought by refugees to Italy, and played a key part in stimulating the Renaissance, and the transition to the modern world. The cumulative influence of the city on the west, over the many centuries of its existence, is incalculable. In terms of technology, art and culture, as well as sheer size, Constantinople was without parallel anywhere in Europe for a thousand years.\n\n===Women in literature===\nConstantinople was home to the first known Western [[Armenian literature|Armenian]] journal published and edited by a woman (Elpis Kesaratsian). Entering circulation in 1862, ''Kit'arr'' or ''Guitar'' stayed in print for only seven months. Female writers who openly expressed their desires were viewed as immodest, but this changed slowly as journals began to publish more \"women's sections\". In the 1880s, Matteos Mamurian invited [[Srpouhi Dussap]] to submit essays for ''Arevelian Mamal''. According to Zaruhi Galemkearian's autobiography, she was told to write about women's place in the family and home after she published two volumes of poetry in the 1890s. By 1900, several Armenian journals had started to include works by female contributors including the Constantinople-based ''Tsaghik''.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge Scholars Press| isbn = 978-1-904303-23-7| last = Rowe| first = Victoria| title = A History of Armenian Women's Writing, 1880\u20131922| date = 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOvE4Ec-_oEC&pg=PA132}}</ref>\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Byzantine architecture}}\n[[File:Ayasofya-Innenansicht.jpg|right|thumb|Interior view of the [[Hagia Sophia]], currently a museum.]]\nThe Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek architectural models and styles to create its own unique type of architecture. The influence of Byzantine architecture and art can be seen in the copies taken from it throughout Europe. Particular examples include [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/San-Marco-Basilica|title=San Marco Basilica &#124; cathedral, Venice, Italy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> the basilicas of [[Ravenna]], and many churches throughout the Slavic East. Also, alone in Europe until the 13th-century Italian [[Italian coin florin|florin]], the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] of [[Diocletian]] becoming the [[bezant]] prized throughout the Middle Ages. Its [[Theodosian Walls|city walls]] were much imitated (for example, see [[Caernarfon Castle]]) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire. In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used.\n\n=== Religion ===\nConstantine's foundation gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, who eventually came to be known as the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]], and made it a prime center of Christianity alongside Rome. This contributed to cultural and theological differences between Eastern and Western Christianity eventually leading to the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] that divided [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Catholicism]] from [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] from 1054 onwards. Constantinople is also of great religious importance to [[Islam]], as the conquest of Constantinople is one of the signs of the [[Islamic eschatology|End time in Islam]].\n\n=== Education ===\nIn 1909, in Constantinople there were 626<!--561+65--> primary schools and 12<!--11+1--> secondary schools. Of the primary schools 561 were of the lower grade and 65 were of the higher grade; of the latter, 34 were public and 31 were private. There was one secondary college and eleven secondary preparatory schools.<ref name=Reportp570>\"Report of the Commissioner of Education for the Year Ended June 30, 1912.\" Whole Number 525. Volume 1.

The 18-meter-tall walls built by [[Theodosius II]] were, in essence, impregnable to the barbarians coming from south of the [[Danube river]], who found easier targets to the west rather than the richer provinces to the east in Asia. From the 5th century, the city was also protected by the [[Anastasian Wall]], a 60-kilometer chain of walls across the [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[peninsula]]. Many scholars{{Who|date=January 2010}} argue that these sophisticated fortifications allowed the east to develop relatively unmolested while [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Western Roman Empire|the west]] collapsed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.civilization.org.uk/decline-and-fall/constantine/constantinople|title=Constantinople|work=Barbarism and Civilization|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nConstantinople's fame was such that [[Sino-Roman relations|it was described]] even in contemporary [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese histories]], the ''[[Old Book of Tang|Old]]'' and ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', which mentioned its massive walls and gates as well as a purported [[Water clock|clepsydra]] mounted with a golden statue of a man.<ref>Ball (2016), pp. 152\u2013153; see also endnote No. 114.</ref><ref name=\"hirth 2000\">Hirth (2000) [1885], [http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/eastasia/romchin1.asp East Asian History Sourcebook].

With the establishment of the Turkish Republic, in 1923 the capital of [[Turkey]] was moved to [[Ankara]] and the original Roman Empire name Constantinople was officially changed to the Turkish name [[Istanbul]]; the city is still referred to as Constantinople in Greek-speaking sources. The original city is located in what is now the European side and the core of modern Istanbul.\n\nIn 324 the ancient city of [[Byzantium]] became the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor [[Constantine the Great]], after whom it was renamed, and dedicated on 11 May 330.<ref name=\"ODB\">{{ODB | title=Constantinople | last = Mango | first = Cyril | authorlink = Cyril Mango | pages = 508\u2013512}}</ref> From the mid-5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe.<ref>Pounds, Norman John Greville.

The first wall of the city was erected by [[Constantine I]], and surrounded the city on both land and sea fronts. Later, in the 5th century, the [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Anthemius (praetorian prefect)|Anthemius]] under the child emperor [[Theodosius II]] undertook the construction of the [[Theodosian Walls]], which consisted of a double wall lying about {{convert|2|km||abbr=out}} to the west of the first wall and a moat with palisades in front.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A History of Byzantine State and Society|last = Treadgold|first = Warren|publisher = Stanford University Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Stanford, CA|page = 89}}</ref> This formidable complex of defences was one of the most sophisticated of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]. The city was built intentionally to rival Rome, and it was claimed that several elevations within its walls matched the 'seven hills' of Rome. Because it was located between the [[Golden Horn]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]] the land area that needed defensive walls was reduced, and this helped it to present an impregnable fortress enclosing magnificent palaces, domes, and towers, the result of the prosperity it achieved from being the gateway between two continents (Europe and Asia) and two seas (the Mediterranean and the Black Sea). Although besieged on numerous occasions by various armies, the defences of Constantinople proved impregnable for nearly nine hundred years.\n\nIn 1204, however, the armies of the [[Fourth Crusade]] took and devastated the city, and its inhabitants lived several decades under Latin misrule.  In 1261 the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] liberated the city, and after the restoration under the [[Palaiologos]] dynasty, enjoyed a partial recovery.  With the advent of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1299, the Byzantine Empire began to lose territories and the city began to lose population. By the early 15th century, the Byzantine Empire was reduced to just Constantinople and its environs, along with [[Morea]] in Greece, making it an enclave inside the Ottoman Empire; after a 53-day siege the city eventually [[fall of Constantinople|fell to the Ottomans]], led by [[Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], on 29 May 1453,<ref name=\"mw28\">M\u00fcller-Wiener (1977), p. 28</ref> whereafter it replaced [[Edirne]] (Adrianople) as the new capital of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Rosenberg, Matt. \"Largest cities through history.\" About.com.</ref>\n\n== Names ==\n\n=== Before Constantinople ===\nAccording to [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', the first known name of a settlement on the site of Constantinople was ''Lygos'',<ref>[http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20IV ''Pliny the Elder'', book IV, chapter XI]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm |date=2017-01-01 }}.

Persian rule lasted until 478&nbsp;BC when as part of the Greek counterattack to the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]], a Greek army led by the Spartan general [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]] captured the city which remained an independent, yet subordinate, city under the Athenians, and later to the Spartans after 411&nbsp;BC.<ref>Thucydides, I, 94</ref> A farsighted treaty with the emergent power of Rome in {{circa|150 BC}} which stipulated tribute in exchange for independent status allowed it to enter Roman rule unscathed.<ref>Harris, 2007, pp. 24\u201325</ref> This treaty would pay dividends retrospectively as Byzantium would maintain this independent status, and prosper under peace and stability in the [[Pax Romana]], for nearly three centuries until the late 2nd century AD.<ref>Harris, 2007, p. 45</ref>\n\nByzantium was never a major influential city-state like that of [[Athens]], [[Corinth]] or [[Sparta]], but the city enjoyed relative peace and steady growth as a prosperous trading city lent by its remarkable position. The site lay astride the land route from [[Europe]] to [[Asia]] and the [[Turkish Straits|seaway]] from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean]], and had in the [[Golden Horn]] an excellent and spacious harbour. Already then, in Greek and early Roman times, Byzantium was famous for its strategic geographic position that made it difficult to besiege and capture, and its position at the crossroads of the Asiatic-European trade route over land and as the gateway between the Mediterranean and Black Seas made it too valuable a settlement to abandon, as Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] later realized when he razed the city to the ground for supporting [[Pescennius Niger]]'s [[Year of the Five Emperors|claimancy]].<ref>Harris, 2007, pp. 44\u201345</ref> It was a move greatly criticized by the contemporary consul and historian [[Cassius Dio]] who said that Severus had destroyed \"a strong Roman outpost and a base of operations against the barbarians from Pontus and Asia\".<ref>Cassius Dio, ix, p. 195</ref> He would later rebuild Byzantium towards the end of his reign, in which it would be briefly renamed ''Augusta Antonina'', fortifying it with a new city wall in his name, the Severan Wall.\n\n=== 324\u2013337: Foundation of Constantinople ===\n[[File:Constantine I Hagia Sophia.jpg|right|thumb|Emperor [[Constantine I]] presents a representation of the city of Constantinople as tribute to an enthroned Mary and Christ Child in this church mosaic.

Having restored the unity of the Empire, and, being in the course of major governmental reforms as well as of [[Constantine I and Christianity|sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church]], he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital. Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians. Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location. Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site of Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the [[Danube]] or the [[Euphrates]] frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire.\n\nConstantinople was built over six years, and consecrated on 11 May 330.<ref name=ODB /><ref>Commemorative coins that were issued during the 330s already refer to the city as ''Constantinopolis'' (see, e.g., Michael Grant, ''The climax of Rome'' (London 1968), p. 133), or \"Constantine's City\".

It is possible that the Emperor called the city \"Second Rome\" ({{lang-grc|\u0394\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u1fec\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7}}, ''Deutera Rh\u014dm\u0113'') by official decree, as reported by the 5th-century church historian [[Socrates of Constantinople]]: See [[Names of Constantinople]].</ref> Constantine divided the expanded city, like Rome, into 14 regions, and ornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis.<ref>A description can be found in the [[Notitia urbis Constantinopolitanae]].</ref> Yet, at first, Constantine's new Rome did not have all the dignities of old Rome. It possessed a [[proconsul]], rather than an [[urban prefect]]. It had no [[praetors]], [[tribunes]], or [[quaestors]]. Although it did have senators, they held the title ''clarus'', not ''[[clarissimus]]'', like those of Rome. It also lacked the panoply of other administrative offices regulating the food supply, police, statues, temples, sewers, aqueducts, or other public works. The new programme of building was carried out in great haste: columns, marbles, doors, and tiles were taken wholesale from the temples of the empire and moved to the new city. In similar fashion, many of the greatest works of Greek and Roman art were soon to be seen in its squares and streets. The emperor stimulated private building by promising householders gifts of land from the imperial estates in [[Diocese of Asia|Asiana]] and [[Diocese of Pontus|Pontica]] and on 18 May 332 he announced that, as in Rome, free distributions of food would be made to the citizens. At the time, the amount is said to have been 80,000 rations a day, doled out from 117 distribution points around the city.<ref>Socrates II.13, cited by J B Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, p. 74.</ref>\n\nConstantine laid out a new square at the centre of old Byzantium, naming it the [[Augustaion|Augustaeum]]. The new senate-house (or Curia) was housed in a basilica on the east side. On the south side of the great square was erected the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]] of the Emperor with its imposing entrance, the [[Chalke]], and its ceremonial suite known as the [[Daphne Palace|Palace of Daphne]]. Nearby was the vast [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]] for chariot-races, seating over 80,000 spectators, and the famed [[Baths of Zeuxippus]]. At the western entrance to the Augustaeum was the [[Milion]], a vaulted monument from which distances were measured across the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nFrom the Augustaeum led a great street, the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]] ({{lang-grc-gre|\u039c\u03ad\u03c3\u03b7 [\u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2]||\"Middle [Street]\"}}), lined with colonnades. As it descended the First Hill of the city and climbed the Second Hill, it passed on the left the [[Praetorium]] or law-court. Then it passed through the oval [[Forum of Constantine]] where there was a second Senate-house and a [[Column of Constantine|high column]] with a statue of Constantine himself in the guise of [[Helios]], crowned with a halo of seven rays and looking toward the rising sun. From there, the Mese passed on and through the [[Forum Tauri]] and then the [[Forum Bovis]], and finally up the Seventh Hill (or Xerolophus) and through to the Golden Gate in the [[Wall of Constantine (Constantinople)|Constantinian Wall]]. After the construction of the [[Theodosian Walls]] in the early 5th century, it was extended to the new [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], reaching a total length of seven [[Roman mile]]s.<ref>J B Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, p. 75.

From the death of Constantine in 337 to the accession of Theodosius I, emperors had been resident only in the years 337\u2013338, 347\u2013351, 358\u2013361, 368\u2013369. Its status as a capital was recognized by the appointment of the first known Urban Prefect of the City Honoratus, who held office from 11 December 359 until 361. The urban prefects had concurrent jurisdiction over three provinces each in the adjacent dioceses of Thrace (in which the city was located), Pontus and Asia comparable to the 100-mile extraordinary jurisdiction of the prefect of Rome. The emperor [[Valens]], who hated the city and spent only one year there, nevertheless built the Palace of [[Hebdomon]] on the shore of the [[Sea of Marmara|Propontis]] near the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], probably for use when reviewing troops. All the emperors up to [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and [[Basiliscus]] were crowned and acclaimed at the Hebdomon. [[Theodosius I]] founded the [[Studion|Church of John the Baptist]] to house the skull of the saint (today preserved at the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]]), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned the ruined temple of [[Aphrodite]] into a coach house for the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian Prefect]]; [[Arcadius]] built a new forum named after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.\n\nAfter the shock of the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, in which the emperor [[Valens]] with the flower of the Roman armies was destroyed by the [[Visigoths]] within a few days' march, the city looked to its defences, and in 413\u2013414 [[Theodosius II]] built the 18-metre (60-foot)-tall [[Walls of Constantinople|triple-wall fortifications]], which were not to be breached until the coming of gunpowder. Theodosius also founded a [[University of Constantinople|University]] near the Forum of Taurus, on 27 February 425.\n\n[[Uldin]], a prince of the [[Huns]], appeared on the Danube about this time and advanced into Thrace, but he was deserted by many of his followers, who joined with the Romans in driving their king back north of the river. Subsequent to this, new walls were built to defend the city and the fleet on the Danube improved.\n\nAfter the [[barbarian]]s overran the Western Roman Empire, Constantinople became the indisputable capital city of the Roman Empire. Emperors were no longer peripatetic between various court capitals and palaces. They remained in their palace in the Great City and sent generals to command their armies. The wealth of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia flowed into Constantinople.\n\n=== 527\u2013565: Constantinople in the Age of Justinian ===\n[[File:Map of Constantinople (1422) by Florentine cartographer Cristoforo Buondelmonte.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|Map of Constantinople (1422) by Florentine cartographer [[Cristoforo Buondelmonti]]<ref>''Liber insularum Archipelagi'', [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], Paris.</ref> is the oldest surviving map of the city, and the only one that predates the Turkish conquest of the city in 1453.]]\n[[File:Hagia Sophia Mars 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|The current [[Hagia Sophia]] was commissioned by Emperor [[Justinian I]] after the previous one was destroyed in the [[Nika riots]] of 532.

It was from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former Diocese of Africa set sail on or about 21 June 533. Before their departure, the ship of the commander [[Belisarius]] was anchored in front of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise. After the victory, in 534, the [[Herod's Temple|Temple treasure of Jerusalem]], looted by the Romans in [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|AD&nbsp;70]] and taken to [[Carthage]] by the [[Vandals]] after their sack of Rome in 455, was brought to Constantinople and deposited for a time, perhaps in the [[Church of St. Polyeuctus]], before being returned to [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] in either the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Church of the Resurrection]] or the New Church.<ref>Margaret Barker, Times Literary Supplement 4 May 2007, p. 26.</ref>\n\nChariot-racing had been important in Rome for centuries. In Constantinople, the hippodrome became over time increasingly a place of political significance. It was where (as a shadow of the popular elections of old Rome) the people by acclamation showed their approval of a new emperor, and also where they openly criticized the government, or clamoured for the removal of unpopular ministers. In the time of Justinian, public order in Constantinople became a critical political issue.\n\nThroughout the late Roman and early Byzantine periods, Christianity was resolving fundamental questions of identity, and the dispute between the [[Chalcedonian Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and the [[monophysites]] became the cause of serious disorder, expressed through allegiance to the horse-racing parties of the Blues and the Greens. The partisans of the Blues and the Greens were said<ref>Procopius' '' Secret History'': see P Neville-Ure, Justinian and his Age, 1951.</ref> to affect untrimmed facial hair, head hair shaved at the front and grown long at the back, and wide-sleeved tunics tight at the wrist; and to form gangs to engage in night-time muggings and street violence. At last these disorders took the form of a major rebellion of 532, known as the [[Nika riots|\"Nika\" riots]] (from the battle-cry of \"Conquer!\" of those involved).<ref>James Grout: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/circusmaximus/nika.html \"The Nika Riot\"], part of the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Romana''</ref>\n\nFires started by the Nika rioters consumed Constantine's basilica of Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom), the city's principal church, which lay to the north of the Augustaeum. Justinian commissioned [[Anthemius of Tralles]] and [[Isidore of Miletus]] to replace it with a new and incomparable [[Hagia Sophia]]. This was the great cathedral of the Orthodox Church, whose dome was said to be held aloft by God alone, and which was directly connected to the palace so that the imperial family could attend services without passing through the streets.<ref>Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of the city, and is now a museum.</ref> The dedication took place on 26 December 537 in the presence of the emperor, who exclaimed, \"O [[Solomon's Temple|Solomon]], I have outdone thee!\"<ref>Source for quote: ''Scriptores originum Constantinopolitanarum'', ed T Preger I 105 (see [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|A.

This was designed in the form of an equal-armed cross with five domes, and ornamented with beautiful mosaics. This church was to remain the burial place of the Emperors from Constantine himself until the 11th century. When the city fell to the Turks in 1453, the church was demolished to make room for the tomb of [[Mehmet II]] the Conqueror. Justinian was also concerned with other aspects of the city's built environment, legislating against the abuse of laws prohibiting building within {{convert|100|ft|m}} of the sea front, in order to protect the view.<ref>Justinian, ''Novellae'' 63 and 165.</ref>\n\nDuring Justinian I's reign, the city's population reached about 500,000 people.<ref>[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/handouts/Population.htm Early Medieval and Byzantine Civilization: Constantine to Crusades] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826083011/http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/handouts/Population.htm |date=August 26, 2015 }}, Dr. Kenneth W.

[[Heraclius]], son of the [[exarch]] of Africa, set sail for the city and assumed the throne. He found the military situation so dire that he is said to have contemplated withdrawing the imperial capital to Carthage, but relented after the people of Constantinople begged him to stay. The citizens lost their right to free grain in 618 when Heraclius realised that the city could no longer be supplied from Egypt as a result of the Persian wars: the population fell substantially as a result.<ref>Possibly from the largest city in the world with 500,000 inhabitants to just 40,000\u201370,000: The Inheritance of Rome, Chris Wickham, Penguin Books Ltd. 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-670-02098-0}} (p. 260)</ref>\n\nWhile the city withstood a [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|siege]] by the Sassanids and Avars in 626, Heraclius campaigned deep into Persian territory and briefly restored the ''status quo'' in 628, when the Persians surrendered all their conquests.

These controversies contributed to the deterioration of relations between the [[Roman Catholic|Western]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] Churches.\n\n=== 1025\u20131081: Constantinople after Basil II ===\nIn the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous defeat of the imperial armies at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in Armenia in 1071. The Emperor [[Romanos IV|Romanus]] Diogenes was captured. The peace terms demanded by [[Alp Arslan]], sultan of the Seljuk Turks, were not excessive, and Romanus accepted them. On his release, however, Romanus found that enemies had placed their own candidate on the throne in his absence; he surrendered to them and suffered death by torture, and the new ruler, [[Michael VII]] Ducas, refused to honour the treaty. In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073. The collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition, and the empire's resources were distracted and squandered in a series of civil wars. Thousands of [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia. By 1080, a huge area had been lost to the Empire, and the Turks were within striking distance of Constantinople.\n\n=== 1081\u20131185: Constantinople under the Comneni ===\n[[File:Byzantium@1180.jpg|thumb|The [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel I]], {{circa|1180}}.]]\n[[File:Istanbul 2009 Comnenus Mosaics.JPG|thumb|12th century [[mosaic]] from the upper gallery of the [[Hagia Sophia]], Constantinople.

The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th century vary from some 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the realm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of money in circulation dramatically increased. This was reflected in Constantinople by the construction of the Blachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general prosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of the Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is certain that the [[Venice|Venetians]] and others were active traders in Constantinople, making a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of [[Outremer]] and the West, while also trading extensively with Byzantium and [[Egypt]]. The Venetians had factories on the north side of the Golden Horn, and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century.

There was a revival in the [[mosaic]] art, for example: Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. There was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work. According to N.H. Baynes (''Byzantium, An Introduction to East Roman Civilization''):\n{{blockquote|\nWith its love of luxury and passion for colour, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the whole of the Christian world. Beautiful silks from the workshops of Constantinople also portrayed in dazzling colour animals \u2013 lions, elephants, eagles, and griffins \u2013 confronting each other, or represented Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase.\n\nFrom the tenth to the twelfth century Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. By their style, arrangement, and iconography the mosaics of St. Mark's at Venice and of the cathedral at [[Torcello]] clearly reveal their Byzantine origin. Similarly those of the [[Cappella Palatina|Palatine Chapel]], the [[Martorana]] at [[Palermo]], and the [[cathedral of Cefal\u00f9]], together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at Monreale, demonstrate the influence of Byzantium on the [[italo-Normans|Norman]] Court of [[Sicily]] in the twelfth century. Hispano-[[Moorish]] art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. [[Romanesque art]] owes much to the East, from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings, as is proved, for instance, by the domed churches of south-western France. Princes of [[Kiev]], [[doge of Venice|Venetian doges]], abbots of [[Monte Cassino]], merchants of [[Amalfi]], and the kings of Sicily all looked to Byzantium for artists or works of art. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the twelfth century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centres dedicated to its production.\"}}\n\n=== 1185\u20131261: Constantinople during the Imperial Exile ===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 012.jpg|thumb|right|''The Entry of the [[Crusade]]rs into Constantinople'', by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], 1840.]]\n[[File:Byzantium1204.png|thumb|The [[Latin Empire]], [[Empire of Nicaea]], [[Empire of Trebizond]], and the [[Despotate of Epirus]].

The reigning emperor Alexius III had made no preparation. The Crusaders occupied [[Galata]], broke the [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] protecting the [[Golden Horn]], and entered the harbour, where on 27 July they breached the sea walls: Alexius III fled. But the new [[Alexius IV]] found the Treasury inadequate, and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his western allies. Tension between the citizens and the Latin soldiers increased. In January 1204, the ''[[protovestiarius]]'' Alexius Murzuphlus provoked a riot, it is presumed, to intimidate Alexius IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of Athena, the work of [[Phidias]], which stood in the principal forum facing west.\n\nIn February 1204, the people rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed, and Murzuphlus took the purple as [[Alexius V]]. He made some attempt to repair the walls and organise the citizenry, but there had been no opportunity to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April failed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the invaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in Hagia Sophia and offered the crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, but it was too late. He came out with the Patriarch to the [[Milion|Golden Milestone]] before the Great Palace and addressed the Varangian Guard. Then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility and embarked for Asia. By the next day the Doge and the leading Franks were installed in the Great Palace, and the city was given over to pillage for three days.\n\n[[Sir Steven Runciman]], historian of the Crusades, wrote that the sack of Constantinople is \"unparalleled in history\".\n\n{{quote|For nine centuries, [...] the great city had been the capital of Christian civilisation. It was filled with works of art that had survived from ancient Greece and with the masterpieces of its own exquisite craftsmen. The Venetians [...] seized treasures and carried them off to adorn [...] their town. But the Frenchmen and Flemings were filled with a lust for destruction. They rushed in a howling mob down the streets and through the houses, snatching up everything that glittered and destroying whatever they could not carry, pausing only to murder or to rape, or to break open the wine-cellars [...] . Neither monasteries nor churches nor libraries were spared. In Hagia Sophia itself, drunken soldiers could be seen tearing down the silken hangings and pulling the great silver [[iconostasis]] to pieces, while sacred books and icons were trampled under foot. While they drank merrily from the altar-vessels a prostitute set herself on the Patriarch's throne and began to sing a ribald French song. Nuns were ravished in their convents. Palaces and hovels alike were entered and wrecked. Wounded women and children lay dying in the streets. For three days the ghastly scenes [...] continued, till the huge and beautiful city was a shambles. [...] When [...] order was restored, [...] citizens were tortured to make them reveal the goods that they had contrived to hide.<ref>Steven Runciman, ''A History of the Crusades'', Cambridge 1966 [1954], vol 3, p. 123.</ref>}}\n\nFor the next half-century, Constantinople was the seat of the [[Latin Empire]]. Under the rulers of the Latin Empire, the city declined, both in population and the condition of its buildings. Alice-Mary Talbot cites an estimated population for Constantinople of 400,000 inhabitants; after the destruction wrought by the Crusaders on the city, about one third were homeless, and numerous courtiers, nobility, and higher clergy, followed various leading personages into exile. \"As a result Constantinople became seriously depopulated,\" Talbot concludes.<ref>Talbot, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291680 \"The Restoration of Constantinople under Michael VIII\"], ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', '''47''' (1993), p. 246</ref>\n\nThe Latins took over at least 20 churches and 13 monasteries, most prominently the Hagia Sophia, which became the cathedral of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. It is to these that E.H. Swift attributed the construction of a series of flying buttresses to shore up the walls of the church, which had been weakened over the centuries by earthquake tremors.<ref>Talbot, \"Restoration of Constantinople\", p. 247</ref> However, this act of maintenance is an exception: for the most part, the Latin occupiers were too few to maintain all of the buildings, either secular and sacred, and many became targets for vandalism or dismantling. Bronze and lead were removed from the roofs of abandoned buildings and melted down and sold to provide money to the chronically under-funded Empire for defense and to support the court; Deno John Geanokoplos writes that \"it may well be that a division is suggested here: Latin laymen stripped secular buildings, ecclesiastics, the churches.\"<ref>Geanakoplos, ''Emperor Michael Palaeologus and the West'' (Harvard University Press, 1959), p. 124 n. 26</ref> Buildings were not the only targets of officials looking to raise funds for the impoverished Latin Empire: the monumental sculptures which adorned the Hippodrome and fora of the city were pulled down and melted for coinage. \"Among the masterpieces destroyed, writes Talbot, \"were a Herakles attributed to the fourth-century B.C. sculptor [[Lysippos]], and monumental figures of Hera, Paris, and Helen.\"<ref name=\"Talbot-248\">Talbot, \"Restoration of Constantinople\", p. 248</ref>\n\nThe Nicaean emperor [[John III Vatatzes]] reportedly saved several churches from being dismantled for their valuable building materials; by sending money to the Latins \"to buy them off\" (''exonesamenos''), he prevented the destruction of several churches.<ref>Geanakoplos, ''Emperor Michael'', p. 124</ref> According to Talbot, these included the churches of Blachernae, [[Rouphinianai]], and St. Michael at Anaplous. He also granted funds for the restoration of the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], which had been seriously damaged in an earthquake.<ref name=\"Talbot-248\" />\n\nThe Byzantine nobility scattered, many going to [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], where Theodore Lascaris set up an imperial court, or to [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], where Theodore Angelus did the same; others fled to [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]], where one of the Comneni had already with Georgian support established an independent seat of empire.<ref>Hussey 1967, p. 70.</ref> Nicaea and Epirus both vied for the imperial title, and tried to recover Constantinople. In 1261, Constantinople was [[Reconquest of Constantinople|captured]] from its last Latin ruler, [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]], by the forces of the [[Nicaean Empire|Nicaean emperor]] [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]].\n\n=== 1261\u20131453: Palaiologan Era and the Fall of Constantinople ===\n{{See also|Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty|Fall of Constantinople}}\n[[File:Zonaro GatesofConst.jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed the Conqueror]] enters Constantinople, painting by [[Fausto Zonaro]].]]\nAlthough Constantinople was retaken by [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], the Empire had lost many of its key economic resources, and struggled to survive. The [[palace of Blachernae]] in the north-west of the city became the main Imperial residence, with the old Great Palace on the shores of the [[Bosporus]] going into decline. When Michael VIII captured the city, its population was 35,000 people, but, by the end of his reign, he had succeeded in increasing the population to about 70,000 people.<ref name=\"popu2\">T.

When [[Mehmed II]] finally entered Constantinople through what is now known as the [[Topkapi Palace|Topkapi Gate]], he immediately rode his horse to the [[Hagia Sophia]], where he ordered his soldiers to stop hacking at the marbles and 'be satisfied with the booty and captives; as for all the buildings, they belonged to him'.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Mansel, Philip.

Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969, p. 236\">Inalcik, Halil. \"The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229\u2013249. p. 236</ref> Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be transferred to Constantinople by September.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969, p. 236\" /> From all over the Islamic empire, prisoners of war and deported people were sent to the city: these people were called \"S\u00fcrg\u00fcn\" in Turkish ({{lang-gr|\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2}}).<ref name=mw28 /> Two centuries later, Ottoman traveler [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] gave a list of groups introduced into the city with their respective origins. Even today, many quarters of [[Istanbul]], such as [[Aksaray, Istanbul|Aksaray]], [[\u00c7ar\u015famba, Istanbul|\u00c7ar\u015famba]], bear the names of the places of origin of their inhabitants.<ref name=mw28 /> However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmet allowed the deported Greeks to come back to the city.<ref name=mw28 />\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Istanbull - palasset - 13.jpg|right|thumb|''Eagle and Snake'', 6th century mosaic flooring Constantinople, [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Grand Imperial Palace]].]]\n\nConstantinople was the largest and richest urban center in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the late Eastern Roman Empire, mostly as a result of its strategic position commanding the trade routes between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. It would remain the capital of the eastern, Greek-speaking empire for over a thousand years. At its peak, roughly corresponding to the Middle Ages, it was the richest and largest European city, exerting a powerful cultural pull and dominating economic life in the Mediterranean. Visitors and merchants were especially struck by the beautiful monasteries and churches of the city, in particular the [[Hagia Sophia]], or the Church of Holy Wisdom. According to Russian 14th-century traveler Stephen of Novgorod: \"As for Hagia Sophia, the human mind can neither tell it nor make description of it.\"\n\nIt was especially important for preserving in its libraries manuscripts of Greek and Latin authors throughout a period when instability and disorder caused their mass-destruction in western Europe and north Africa: On the city's fall, thousands of these were brought by refugees to Italy, and played a key part in stimulating the Renaissance, and the transition to the modern world. The cumulative influence of the city on the west, over the many centuries of its existence, is incalculable. In terms of technology, art and culture, as well as sheer size, Constantinople was without parallel anywhere in Europe for a thousand years.\n\n===Women in literature===\nConstantinople was home to the first known Western [[Armenian literature|Armenian]] journal published and edited by a woman (Elpis Kesaratsian). Entering circulation in 1862, ''Kit'arr'' or ''Guitar'' stayed in print for only seven months. Female writers who openly expressed their desires were viewed as immodest, but this changed slowly as journals began to publish more \"women's sections\". In the 1880s, Matteos Mamurian invited [[Srpouhi Dussap]] to submit essays for ''Arevelian Mamal''. According to Zaruhi Galemkearian's autobiography, she was told to write about women's place in the family and home after she published two volumes of poetry in the 1890s. By 1900, several Armenian journals had started to include works by female contributors including the Constantinople-based ''Tsaghik''.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge Scholars Press| isbn = 978-1-904303-23-7| last = Rowe| first = Victoria| title = A History of Armenian Women's Writing, 1880\u20131922| date = 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOvE4Ec-_oEC&pg=PA132}}</ref>\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Byzantine architecture}}\n[[File:Ayasofya-Innenansicht.jpg|right|thumb|Interior view of the [[Hagia Sophia]], currently a museum.]]\nThe Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek architectural models and styles to create its own unique type of architecture. The influence of Byzantine architecture and art can be seen in the copies taken from it throughout Europe. Particular examples include [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/San-Marco-Basilica|title=San Marco Basilica &#124; cathedral, Venice, Italy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> the basilicas of [[Ravenna]], and many churches throughout the Slavic East. Also, alone in Europe until the 13th-century Italian [[Italian coin florin|florin]], the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] of [[Diocletian]] becoming the [[bezant]] prized throughout the Middle Ages. Its [[Theodosian Walls|city walls]] were much imitated (for example, see [[Caernarfon Castle]]) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire. In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used.\n\n=== Religion ===\nConstantine's foundation gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, who eventually came to be known as the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]], and made it a prime center of Christianity alongside Rome. This contributed to cultural and theological differences between Eastern and Western Christianity eventually leading to the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] that divided [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Catholicism]] from [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] from 1054 onwards. Constantinople is also of great religious importance to [[Islam]], as the conquest of Constantinople is one of the signs of the [[Islamic eschatology|End time in Islam]].\n\n=== Education ===\nIn 1909, in Constantinople there were 626<!--561+65--> primary schools and 12<!--11+1--> secondary schools. Of the primary schools 561 were of the lower grade and 65 were of the higher grade; of the latter, 34 were public and 31 were private.

On January 19, 2001 the mayor of [[Almer\u00eda|Almeria]] Santiago Mart\u00ednez Cabrejas announced in the City Council that the new club UD Almer\u00eda was born after the merge of two city's teams - Polideportivo Almer\u00eda and Almer\u00eda CF.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.udalmeriasad.com/club/historia|title=La historia del Club {{!}} Almer\u00eda - Web Oficial|website=La historia del Club {{!}} Almer\u00eda - Web Oficial|language=es|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> But UD Almer\u00eda was not official until June 28, 2001, when Almeria CF approved at the General Meeting of Shareholders the renaming.<ref name=\":0\" /> After playing one season in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|second division]], it was relegated to the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B|third]] and the [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n|fourth divisions]].\n\nAfter spending several seasons in the second level, Almer\u00eda side was first promoted to the top flight after finishing runner-up in the [[2006\u201307 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|2006\u201307 season]]. After some outstanding performances, as the away win against [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a]] 3-0 in the first [[La Liga]] match, the team achieved a final 8th league place in [[2007\u201308 La Liga|2007\u201308]].<ref name=\":0\" /> At the club's helm was coach [[Unai Emery|Unai Ebery]], as [[Forward (association football)|striker]] [[\u00c1lvaro Negredo]] finished team topscorer with 13 goals.\n\nAfter Emery left for [[Valencia CF]], [[Gonzalo Arconada Echarri|Gonzalo Arconada]] stepped in, but was sacked on 21 December 2008, after a string of poor results, albeit without ever reaching the last three. [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Hugo S\u00e1nchez]] took the job, and fared slightly better, for a [[2008\u201309 La Liga|final mid-table position]].\n\nIn [[2010\u201311 La Liga|2010\u201311]], Almer\u00eda [[2010\u201311 Copa del Rey|reached the semifinals]] of the [[Copa del Rey]] for the first time ever.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the league, however, the club was finally relegated after a four-year spell in the top flight; in November 2010, coach [[Juan Manuel Lillo]] was fired after a 0\u20138 home loss against [[FC Barcelona]] (precisely the team that ousted the Andalusians in the domestic cup's last-four, with the same score, but on aggregate), and his successor [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Oltra]] met the same fate, in April 2011.\n\nAfter two seasons in the second level, Almer\u00eda returned to the main category of Spanish football on 22 June 2013, after defeating [[Girona FC]] in the [[2013 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n play-offs|play-offs]].

In 1989, a club named ''Almer\u00eda Club de F\u00fatbol'' was born, but in 2001 was renamed ''Uni\u00f3n Deportiva Almer\u00eda''. On January 19, 2001 the mayor of [[Almer\u00eda|Almeria]] Santiago Mart\u00ednez Cabrejas announced in the City Council that the new club UD Almer\u00eda was born after the merge of two city's teams - Polideportivo Almer\u00eda and Almer\u00eda CF.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.udalmeriasad.com/club/historia|title=La historia del Club {{!}} Almer\u00eda - Web Oficial|website=La historia del Club {{!}} Almer\u00eda - Web Oficial|language=es|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> But UD Almer\u00eda was not official until June 28, 2001, when Almeria CF approved at the General Meeting of Shareholders the renaming.<ref name=\":0\" /> After playing one season in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|second division]], it was relegated to the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B|third]] and the [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n|fourth divisions]].\n\nAfter spending several seasons in the second level, Almer\u00eda side was first promoted to the top flight after finishing runner-up in the [[2006\u201307 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|2006\u201307 season]].

The term was used by the ancient Germanic peoples to describe inhabitants of the former [[Western Roman Empire]], who were largely [[romanised]] and spoke Latin or Celtic languages (cf. [[Valland]] in [[Old Norse]]). The adjectival form is attested in Old Norse ''{{lang|non|valskr}}'', meaning \"French\"; [[Old High German]] ''{{lang|goh|walhisk}}'', meaning \"Romance\"; [[New High German]] ''{{lang|de|welsch}}'', used in [[Switzerland]] and [[South Tyrol]] for [[Romance languages|Romance]] speakers; [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''{{lang|nl|Waals}}'' \"[[Walloons|Walloon]]\"; [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|welis\u010b}}'', ''{{lang|ang|w\u00e6lis\u010b}}'', ''{{lang|ang|wilis\u010b}}'', meaning \"[[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]]\".

It is assumed that this term specifically referred to the Celtic [[Volcae]], because application of [[Grimm's law]] to that word produces the form ''*Walh-''. Subsequently, this term ''*Walh\u014dz'' was applied rather indiscriminately to the southern neighbours of the Germanic people, as evidenced in geographic names such as [[Walchgau]] and [[Walchensee]] in Bavaria.<ref name=\"Quak 2005\"/> These southern neighbours, however, were then already completely Romanised. Thus, Germanic speakers generalised this name first to all [[Celts]], and later to all [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and Romanised peoples. [[Old High German]] ''Walh'' became ''Walch'' in [[Middle High German]], and the adjective OHG ''walhisk'' became MHG ''welsch'', e.g. in the 1240 [[Alexander romance]] by [[Rudolf von Ems]] \u2013 resulting in ''Welsche'' in [[Early New High German]] and modern [[Swiss German]] as the [[exonym and endonym|exonym]] for all [[Romance languages|Romance]] speakers. For instance, the historical German name for [[Trentino]], the part of [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] with a Romance speaking majority, is ''Welschtirol'', and the historical German name for [[Verona]] is ''Welschbern''.\n\nToday, ''welsch'' is not in usage in German except in Switzerland. This term is used there not only in a historical context, but also as a somewhat pejorative word to describe [[Swiss people|Swiss]] speakers of Italian and French.\n\n==From ''*Walhaz'' to ''Vlach''==\n{{Main|Vlachs}}\n{{wiktionary|Vlach}}\nIn [[Central and Eastern Europe]], the word for [[Italic peoples|Romance peoples]] was borrowed from the [[Goths]] (as *''walhs'') into [[Proto-Slavic]] some time before the [[7th century]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The first source using the word was the writings of Byzantine historian [[George Kedrenos]] in the mid-11th century.\n\nFrom the Slavs the term passed to other peoples, such as the [[Hungarians]] (''ol\u00e1h'', referring to [[Vlachs]], more specifically [[Romanians]], ''olasz'', referring to Italians), [[Turkish people|Turks]] (\"Ulahlar\") and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] (\"\u0392\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9\", \"Vl\u00e1hi\") and was used for all Latin people of the [[Balkans]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Decadence, Rome and Romania, the Emperors Who Weren't, and Other Reflections on Roman History|journal=The Proceedings of the Friesian School|author= Kelley L. Ross|year=2003|quote=Note: The Vlach Connection|url=http://www.friesian.com/decdenc2.htm|accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nOver time, the term ''Vlach'' (and its different forms) also acquired different meanings. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks in the Balkans commonly used the term to denote native Balkan Christians (possibly due to the cultural link between Christianity and Roman culture),{{fact|date=September 2017}} and in parts of the Balkans the term came to denote \"[[shepherd]]\" \u2013 from the occupation of many of the Vlachs throughout Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Polish words ''W\u0142och'' (pl.

It is assumed that this term specifically referred to the Celtic [[Volcae]], because application of [[Grimm's law]] to that word produces the form ''*Walh-''. Subsequently, this term ''*Walh\u014dz'' was applied rather indiscriminately to the southern neighbours of the Germanic people, as evidenced in geographic names such as [[Walchgau]] and [[Walchensee]] in Bavaria.<ref name=\"Quak 2005\"/> These southern neighbours, however, were then already completely Romanised. Thus, Germanic speakers generalised this name first to all [[Celts]], and later to all [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and Romanised peoples. [[Old High German]] ''Walh'' became ''Walch'' in [[Middle High German]], and the adjective OHG ''walhisk'' became MHG ''welsch'', e.g. in the 1240 [[Alexander romance]] by [[Rudolf von Ems]] \u2013 resulting in ''Welsche'' in [[Early New High German]] and modern [[Swiss German]] as the [[exonym and endonym|exonym]] for all [[Romance languages|Romance]] speakers. For instance, the historical German name for [[Trentino]], the part of [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] with a Romance speaking majority, is ''Welschtirol'', and the historical German name for [[Verona]] is ''Welschbern''.\n\nToday, ''welsch'' is not in usage in German except in Switzerland. This term is used there not only in a historical context, but also as a somewhat pejorative word to describe [[Swiss people|Swiss]] speakers of Italian and French.\n\n==From ''*Walhaz'' to ''Vlach''==\n{{Main|Vlachs}}\n{{wiktionary|Vlach}}\nIn [[Central and Eastern Europe]], the word for [[Italic peoples|Romance peoples]] was borrowed from the [[Goths]] (as *''walhs'') into [[Proto-Slavic]] some time before the [[7th century]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The first source using the word was the writings of Byzantine historian [[George Kedrenos]] in the mid-11th century.\n\nFrom the Slavs the term passed to other peoples, such as the [[Hungarians]] (''ol\u00e1h'', referring to [[Vlachs]], more specifically [[Romanians]], ''olasz'', referring to Italians), [[Turkish people|Turks]] (\"Ulahlar\") and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] (\"\u0392\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9\", \"Vl\u00e1hi\") and was used for all Latin people of the [[Balkans]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Decadence, Rome and Romania, the Emperors Who Weren't, and Other Reflections on Roman History|journal=The Proceedings of the Friesian School|author= Kelley L.

It is located in the western part of the city and borders the nature reserve [[:de:Freiburger Rieselfeld|Freiburger Rieselfeld]] in the west, right next to a little zoo called Tiergehege [[Mundenhof]], [[:de:Opfingen|Opfinger]] Stra\u00dfe in the south and [[Besan\u00e7on]]<nowiki />allee in the east. The industrial area [[:de:Haid (Freiburg im Breisgau)|Haid]] is part of the [[Sankt Georgen (Freiburg im Breisgau)|Sankt Georgen]] district and is located to the south of Rieselfeld, while the district [[Weingarten (Freiburg im Breisgau)|Weingarten]] is situated to the east of Rieselfeld.\n\n== History ==\nThe word ''Rieselfeld'' means [[leach field]] in [[German language|German]] and refers to how the area started. To ensure wastewater disposal for the city, which had grown to a population number of over 50,000 inhabitants, [[Freiburg]] acquired an area spanning 500 hectares from the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1891. After [[Nazism]] had ended, [[Sinti]], among them some who had survived the [[Holocaust]],  settled in the area of Haid, an district adjacent to today's Rieselfeld. The Opfinger Siedlung, home of alleged outlaws and criminals, was also very close by.<ref>Peter Widmann: ''Auszug aus den Baracken. Der Aufstieg der Sozialp\u00e4dagogik und die deutsche Kommunalpolitik gegen\u00fcber \u201eZigeunern\u201c seit 1945.'' In: Michael Zimmermann (Hrsg.): ''Zwischen Erziehung und Vernichtung. Zigeunerpolitik und Zigeunerforschung im Europa des 20. Jahrhunderts.'' Stuttgart 2007, S. 36.</ref> Living in these areas, which were not yet situated in the city, meant societal exclusion for the inhabitants.\n\nIn 1985, the sewage plant had to be shut down due to insufficient capacity to deal with wastewater. The amount of wastewater had increased to 90,00&nbsp;m\u00b3 per day and the disposal could not be handled without preparing the soil of the area beforehand, which caused additional legal problems.\n\nThe Rieselfeld district was established in 1992 when a competition to design city districts was initiated. The group \"S\u00fcd-West\" from L\u00f6rrach won the competition together with the architectural firm B\u00f6wer Eith Murken Spiecker, the architect Manfred Morlock and the landscaper Bernd Meier. The overall management was assigned to Hans Rudolf G\u00fcdemann.<ref>[http://www.deutscherwerkbund-nw.de/index.php?id=650 deutscherwerkbund-nw.de]</ref>\n\nAfter several soil analyses and the subsequent soil stripping, all requirements were fulfilled to build on the former wastewater disposal area. In 1993, work started in the first segment. In 1994, the first apartments were being built and only two years later, the first apartments were finished and given over to the new inhabitants. The next year, the Clara-Grunwald primary school was opened and the Kepler Gymnasium, which already existed at this point, was moved into the newly built complex. Additionally, the Sepp-Glaser gym was dedicated and the initial work for the second and third segments of project \u201cRieselfeld\u201d were started. To ensure public transportation to Freiburg's city centre, tram line 5 was also installed in 1997.\n \nIn 2000, work for the fourth and last segment of \u201cRieselfeld\u201d was started. One year later, a park was added as well as a church and a community centre. In July 2006, work to expand the Kepler Gymnasium was started.\n\n== Funding ==\n[[File:Freiburg Rieselfeld 2007.jpg|thumb|Rieselfeld (October 2007)]]\n\nSince the site was owned by the city funding for planning and development costs was raised through the sale of the site itself. The initial costs currently amount to 145 million euros, of which 85 million were offset by the sale of the site. The Rieselfeld Project was coordinated by the building department, specifically the newly founded group called \u201cProjektgruppe Rieselfeld\u201d. The development of the site was undertaken by commercial building contractors as well as private property developers, that is to say a collaborative association. In order to prevent an area of homogenous buildings, each investor was only allowed to build 40 housing units in one area, which equals three building plots.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Maria Magdalena (Freiburg) 1.jpg|thumb|Maria-Magdalena-Kirche]]\n\nAlmost all the apartments in Rieselfeld are arranged in rows of houses along the street with green spaces and gardens in between and in back. Urban style buildings, with no space in between, were, however, built along the Rieselfeldallee which functioned as a principal axis for the area and accommodated the tram line. In order to ensure a heterogenous social structure, rental and owner-occupied apartments as well as single family homes and blocks of flats were not separated from each other. With regards to environmental sustainability the entire development is constructed to be energy saving, mostly using renewable power sources. In addition, the district is both entirely wheelchair and buggy friendly. The Maria-Magdalena Church is a compact concrete building designed by Susanne Gross, an architect from [[Cologne]]. The fact that it is a church is not immediately obvious, especially as it is missing a tower. It is located in the centre of Rieselfeld and is, somewhat unusually, home to both a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Lutheran]] Church which are both named after Mary Magdalene. The two Churches are separated by a large foyer with a side wall which can be moved to make a large joint room out of the two sacred spaces.\n\n== Demography ==\n[[File:Kepler-Gymnasium Rieselfeld.jpg|thumb|Kepler-Gymnasium (a High School in Rieselfeld)]]\nThe demographic of Rieselfeld is characterised by two striking factors:\n*  Of the 6000 residents living in the district midway through 2004, 75% were from the city of [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] or from nearby areas.\n*  Around one third of the residents are under 18.\n\nWith regards to the second point, three schools - a primary school, a secondary school (which was relocated there from the city centre) and the third [[Waldorf School]] in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] - as well as several nurseries have been built.\n\n== Job market ==\nAmong other things, the district was designed to enable residents to find a job in Rieselfeld or in the immediate vicinity (e.g. the industrial area [[:de:Haid (Freiburg im Breisgau)|Haid]]). After construction in the district was completed in 2013, around 1,000 new jobs in kindergartens, schools, restaurants and doctor's surgeries have since been created.\n\n== Traffic regulations ==\nAll streets in the district have a speed limit of [[30 km/h zone|30 kmh]] (approximately 18,6&nbsp;mph) in order to keep individual traffic low and make the district quiet and family-friendly. The tram line 5, leading through the main street of the district, has connected Rieselfeld with the city centre since 1997 and enables people to reach it within 15 to 20 minutes by getting on the tram at one of the three stops ''Maria-von-Rudloff-PLatz'', ''Geschwister-Scholl-Platz'' and ''Bollerstaudenstra\u00dfe''. Rieselfeld is also served by several bus lines.\n\n== Parks ==\nA small park was built right next to the secondary school ''Kepler-Gymnasium'' in the north of Rieselfeld, including a lawn for sunbathing and a playground for children. The primary school ''Clara-Grundwald-Grundschule'' is opposite the ''Kepler-Gymnasium''. The green roof of the primary school's gym is accessible and connects the park with the ''Maria-von-Rudloff-Patz''.

It is located in the western part of the city and borders the nature reserve [[:de:Freiburger Rieselfeld|Freiburger Rieselfeld]] in the west, right next to a little zoo called Tiergehege [[Mundenhof]], [[:de:Opfingen|Opfinger]] Stra\u00dfe in the south and [[Besan\u00e7on]]<nowiki />allee in the east. The industrial area [[:de:Haid (Freiburg im Breisgau)|Haid]] is part of the [[Sankt Georgen (Freiburg im Breisgau)|Sankt Georgen]] district and is located to the south of Rieselfeld, while the district [[Weingarten (Freiburg im Breisgau)|Weingarten]] is situated to the east of Rieselfeld.\n\n== History ==\nThe word ''Rieselfeld'' means [[leach field]] in [[German language|German]] and refers to how the area started. To ensure wastewater disposal for the city, which had grown to a population number of over 50,000 inhabitants, [[Freiburg]] acquired an area spanning 500 hectares from the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1891. After [[Nazism]] had ended, [[Sinti]], among them some who had survived the [[Holocaust]],  settled in the area of Haid, an district adjacent to today's Rieselfeld. The Opfinger Siedlung, home of alleged outlaws and criminals, was also very close by.<ref>Peter Widmann: ''Auszug aus den Baracken. Der Aufstieg der Sozialp\u00e4dagogik und die deutsche Kommunalpolitik gegen\u00fcber \u201eZigeunern\u201c seit 1945.'' In: Michael Zimmermann (Hrsg.): ''Zwischen Erziehung und Vernichtung. Zigeunerpolitik und Zigeunerforschung im Europa des 20. Jahrhunderts.'' Stuttgart 2007, S. 36.</ref> Living in these areas, which were not yet situated in the city, meant societal exclusion for the inhabitants.\n\nIn 1985, the sewage plant had to be shut down due to insufficient capacity to deal with wastewater. The amount of wastewater had increased to 90,00&nbsp;m\u00b3 per day and the disposal could not be handled without preparing the soil of the area beforehand, which caused additional legal problems.\n\nThe Rieselfeld district was established in 1992 when a competition to design city districts was initiated. The group \"S\u00fcd-West\" from L\u00f6rrach won the competition together with the architectural firm B\u00f6wer Eith Murken Spiecker, the architect Manfred Morlock and the landscaper Bernd Meier. The overall management was assigned to Hans Rudolf G\u00fcdemann.<ref>[http://www.deutscherwerkbund-nw.de/index.php?id=650 deutscherwerkbund-nw.de]</ref>\n\nAfter several soil analyses and the subsequent soil stripping, all requirements were fulfilled to build on the former wastewater disposal area. In 1993, work started in the first segment. In 1994, the first apartments were being built and only two years later, the first apartments were finished and given over to the new inhabitants. The next year, the Clara-Grunwald primary school was opened and the Kepler Gymnasium, which already existed at this point, was moved into the newly built complex. Additionally, the Sepp-Glaser gym was dedicated and the initial work for the second and third segments of project \u201cRieselfeld\u201d were started. To ensure public transportation to Freiburg's city centre, tram line 5 was also installed in 1997.\n \nIn 2000, work for the fourth and last segment of \u201cRieselfeld\u201d was started. One year later, a park was added as well as a church and a community centre. In July 2006, work to expand the Kepler Gymnasium was started.\n\n== Funding ==\n[[File:Freiburg Rieselfeld 2007.jpg|thumb|Rieselfeld (October 2007)]]\n\nSince the site was owned by the city funding for planning and development costs was raised through the sale of the site itself. The initial costs currently amount to 145 million euros, of which 85 million were offset by the sale of the site. The Rieselfeld Project was coordinated by the building department, specifically the newly founded group called \u201cProjektgruppe Rieselfeld\u201d. The development of the site was undertaken by commercial building contractors as well as private property developers, that is to say a collaborative association. In order to prevent an area of homogenous buildings, each investor was only allowed to build 40 housing units in one area, which equals three building plots.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Maria Magdalena (Freiburg) 1.jpg|thumb|Maria-Magdalena-Kirche]]\n\nAlmost all the apartments in Rieselfeld are arranged in rows of houses along the street with green spaces and gardens in between and in back. Urban style buildings, with no space in between, were, however, built along the Rieselfeldallee which functioned as a principal axis for the area and accommodated the tram line. In order to ensure a heterogenous social structure, rental and owner-occupied apartments as well as single family homes and blocks of flats were not separated from each other. With regards to environmental sustainability the entire development is constructed to be energy saving, mostly using renewable power sources. In addition, the district is both entirely wheelchair and buggy friendly. The Maria-Magdalena Church is a compact concrete building designed by Susanne Gross, an architect from [[Cologne]]. The fact that it is a church is not immediately obvious, especially as it is missing a tower. It is located in the centre of Rieselfeld and is, somewhat unusually, home to both a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Lutheran]] Church which are both named after Mary Magdalene. The two Churches are separated by a large foyer with a side wall which can be moved to make a large joint room out of the two sacred spaces.\n\n== Demography ==\n[[File:Kepler-Gymnasium Rieselfeld.jpg|thumb|Kepler-Gymnasium (a High School in Rieselfeld)]]\nThe demographic of Rieselfeld is characterised by two striking factors:\n*  Of the 6000 residents living in the district midway through 2004, 75% were from the city of [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] or from nearby areas.\n*  Around one third of the residents are under 18.\n\nWith regards to the second point, three schools - a primary school, a secondary school (which was relocated there from the city centre) and the third [[Waldorf School]] in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] - as well as several nurseries have been built.\n\n== Job market ==\nAmong other things, the district was designed to enable residents to find a job in Rieselfeld or in the immediate vicinity (e.g. the industrial area [[:de:Haid (Freiburg im Breisgau)|Haid]]). After construction in the district was completed in 2013, around 1,000 new jobs in kindergartens, schools, restaurants and doctor's surgeries have since been created.\n\n== Traffic regulations ==\nAll streets in the district have a speed limit of [[30 km/h zone|30 kmh]] (approximately 18,6&nbsp;mph) in order to keep individual traffic low and make the district quiet and family-friendly. The tram line 5, leading through the main street of the district, has connected Rieselfeld with the city centre since 1997 and enables people to reach it within 15 to 20 minutes by getting on the tram at one of the three stops ''Maria-von-Rudloff-PLatz'', ''Geschwister-Scholl-Platz'' and ''Bollerstaudenstra\u00dfe''. Rieselfeld is also served by several bus lines.\n\n== Parks ==\nA small park was built right next to the secondary school ''Kepler-Gymnasium'' in the north of Rieselfeld, including a lawn for sunbathing and a playground for children. The primary school ''Clara-Grundwald-Grundschule'' is opposite the ''Kepler-Gymnasium''. The green roof of the primary school's gym is accessible and connects the park with the ''Maria-von-Rudloff-Patz''. There is also a sports field north of ''Mundenhofer Stra\u00dfe''.\nThe second park is located in the southwest of the district. It is a [[wetland|wetland biotope]] that is watered only with rainwater from the surrounding rooftops. [[Daucus carota|Wild carrot]] (Queen Anne's lace) is the host plant for the caterpillars of the [[Papilio machaon|Old World swallowtail]] and grows at the border of the park.\nThe nature reserve [[:de:Freiburger Rieselfeld|Freiburger Rieselfeld]] borders the district to the west and functions as a local recreation area for its residents.\n\n== Famous people ==\n* [[Bahar K\u0131z\u0131l]], member of the former pop girl group [[Monrose]], lives in Rieselfeld.<ref>[http://www.badische-zeitung.de/rock-pop/fhm-und-bahar-kizil-die-rose-vom-rieselfeld--15779043.html badische-zeitung.de]</ref>\n* [[:de:K%C3%A4the Vordtriede|K\u00e4the Vordtriede]], journalist, author and Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9, was honoured in Germany for the first time when a street was named after her in this district.\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Wilhelm Lubberger: Die Rieselfelder-Anlage.

European Americans later developed the city of Springfield, Ohio near here.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the Piqua Sept of the Ohio Shawnee Tribe placed a traditional sacred cedar pole in commemoration of the Peckuwe village site and their tribe.

In 1894, [[The Kelly Springfield Tire Company]] was founded in the city.\n\nP. P. Mast started ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'' magazine to promote the products of his agricultural equipment company. His publishing company, known as Mast, Crowell, and Kirkpatrick, eventually developed as the [[Crowell-Collier Publishing Company]], best known for publishing ''[[Collier's Weekly]].''\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Springfield became known as the \"Home City.\" It was a period of high activity by fraternal organizations, and such lodges as the [[Masonic Lodge]], [[Knights of Pythias]], and [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows]] built homes for orphans and aged members of their orders. Springfield also became known as \"The Champion City,\" a reference to the [[Champion Farm Equipment]] brand, manufactured by the Warder, Bushnell & Glessner Company. In 1902 this company was absorbed into [[International Harvester]]. The latter operates today in Springfield as [[Navistar International]], a manufacturer of medium to large trucks.\n\nIn 1902 A.B. Graham, then the superintendent of schools for Springfield Township in Clark County, established a \"Boys' and Girls' Agricultural Club.\" Approximately 85 children from 10 to 15 years of age attended the first meeting on January 15, 1902, in Springfield, in the basement of the Clark County Courthouse. This was the start of what would soon be called the \"[[4-H]] Club\"; it expanded to become a nationwide organization, at a time when agriculture was a mainstay of the economy in many regions. (4-H stands for \"Head, Heart, Hands, and Health\").<ref>\"4-H History.\"  Available at: [http://www.national4-hheadquarters.gov/about/4h_history.htm National4-hheadquarters.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009054014/http://www.national4-hheadquarters.gov/about/4h_history.htm |date=October 9, 2008 }}</ref>  The first projects included food preservation, gardening, and elementary agriculture. Today, the Courthouse still bears a large 4H symbol under the flag pole at the front of the building to commemorate its role in founding the organization. The Clark County Fair is the second-largest fair in the state (only the [[Ohio State Fair]] is larger), and the 4H has continued to be very popular in this area.\n\nOn March 7, 1904, over a thousand white residents formed a [[Lynching|lynch mob]], stormed the jail, and removed prisoner Richard Dixon, a black man accused of killing police officer Charles B. Collis. Dixon was shot to death and then hanged from a pole on the corner of Fountain and Main Street, where the mob shot his body numerous times. From there the mob rioted through the town, destroying and burning much of the black area.

Among them were the Bramwell, Brenning, Foos, Frayer-Miller, Kelly Steam, Russell-Springfield, and Westcott. The Westcott, known as \"the car built to last,\" was a six-cylinder four-door sedan manufactured by Burton J. Westcott of the [[Westcott Automobile|Westcott Motor Car Company]].\n\nWestcott and his wife Orpha are now even better known for having commissioned architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] in 1908 to design their home at 1340 East High Street. The [[Westcott House (Springfield, Ohio)|Westcott House]], a sprawling two-story stucco and concrete house, has all the features of Wright's \"prairie style,\" including horizontal lines, low-pitched roof, and broad eaves. Wright became world-renowned, and this is his only prairie-style house in the state of Ohio.\n\nIn 2000 the property was purchased by the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy (based in [[Chicago]].) As part of a prearranged plan, the house was sold to a newly formed local Westcott House Foundation. This Foundation managed an extensive 5-year, $5.3 million restoration, completed in October 2005. The landmark house is now open to the public for guided tours.\n\n[[International Harvester]] (now [[Navistar International]]), a manufacturer of farm machinery and later trucks, became the leading local industry after 1856, when Springfield native William Whiteley invented the self-raking reaper and mower. International Harvester and [[Crowell-Collier Publishing Company|Crowell-Collier Publishing]] were the major employers throughout most of the next century. Due to changing tastes, Crowell-Collier closed its magazines in 1957 and sold its Springfield printing plant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/03/21/archives/collier-holders-back-plant-sale-debts-put-at-9000000-56-net-of-book.html|title=COLLIER HOLDERS BACK PLANT SALE; Debts Put at $9,000,000-- '56 Net of Book Business Given as $5,000,000 $3,600,000 Needed COLLIER HOLDERS BACK PLANT SALE|date=1957-03-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century to present===\nThe decline in manufacturing and other [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] industries in the United States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries resulted in significant economic and population losses in Springfield.

These were the settlements of the [[Pekowi|Peckuwe]] and [[Kispoko]] divisions of the [[Shawnee|Shawnee Tribe]].\n\nDuring the American Revolution and associated frontier wars, European Americans destroyed these villages in the [[Battle of Piqua]], August 8, 1780. European Americans later developed the city of Springfield, Ohio near here.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the Piqua Sept of the Ohio Shawnee Tribe placed a traditional sacred cedar pole in commemoration of the Peckuwe village site and their tribe.

It was named for historic [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. When [[Clark County, Ohio|Clark County]] was created in 1818 from parts of [[Champaign County, Ohio|Champaign]], [[Madison County, Ohio|Madison]], and [[Greene County, Ohio|Greene]] counties, Springfield was chosen by the legislature over the village of New Boston (another village named after a New England predecessor) as the county seat, winning by two votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.springfieldohio.net/history/ghost-towns/new-boston.php |title=History of Clark County: New Boston |department=Ghost Towns |publisher=The Network of Springfield, Ohio |date=2008 |access-date=March 27, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115115802/http://www.springfieldohio.net/history/ghost-towns/new-boston.php |archivedate=January 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nEarly growth in Springfield was stimulated by federal construction of the [[National Road]] into Ohio.

Springfield also became known as \"The Champion City,\" a reference to the [[Champion Farm Equipment]] brand, manufactured by the Warder, Bushnell & Glessner Company. In 1902 this company was absorbed into [[International Harvester]]. The latter operates today in Springfield as [[Navistar International]], a manufacturer of medium to large trucks.\n\nIn 1902 A.B. Graham, then the superintendent of schools for Springfield Township in Clark County, established a \"Boys' and Girls' Agricultural Club.\" Approximately 85 children from 10 to 15 years of age attended the first meeting on January 15, 1902, in Springfield, in the basement of the Clark County Courthouse. This was the start of what would soon be called the \"[[4-H]] Club\"; it expanded to become a nationwide organization, at a time when agriculture was a mainstay of the economy in many regions.

Westcott of the [[Westcott Automobile|Westcott Motor Car Company]].\n\nWestcott and his wife Orpha are now even better known for having commissioned architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] in 1908 to design their home at 1340 East High Street. The [[Westcott House (Springfield, Ohio)|Westcott House]], a sprawling two-story stucco and concrete house, has all the features of Wright's \"prairie style,\" including horizontal lines, low-pitched roof, and broad eaves. Wright became world-renowned, and this is his only prairie-style house in the state of Ohio.\n\nIn 2000 the property was purchased by the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy (based in [[Chicago]].) As part of a prearranged plan, the house was sold to a newly formed local Westcott House Foundation. This Foundation managed an extensive 5-year, $5.3 million restoration, completed in October 2005. The landmark house is now open to the public for guided tours.\n\n[[International Harvester]] (now [[Navistar International]]), a manufacturer of farm machinery and later trucks, became the leading local industry after 1856, when Springfield native William Whiteley invented the self-raking reaper and mower. International Harvester and [[Crowell-Collier Publishing Company|Crowell-Collier Publishing]] were the major employers throughout most of the next century. Due to changing tastes, Crowell-Collier closed its magazines in 1957 and sold its Springfield printing plant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/03/21/archives/collier-holders-back-plant-sale-debts-put-at-9000000-56-net-of-book.html|title=COLLIER HOLDERS BACK PLANT SALE; Debts Put at $9,000,000-- '56 Net of Book Business Given as $5,000,000 $3,600,000 Needed COLLIER HOLDERS BACK PLANT SALE|date=1957-03-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century to present===\nThe decline in manufacturing and other [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] industries in the United States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries resulted in significant economic and population losses in Springfield.
