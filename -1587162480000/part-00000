Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The [[Kama Sutra]], a [[Sanskrit]] text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term ''tritiya-prakriti'' to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (''svairini'', who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as ''kami'' or ''paksha''), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Samhita and the [[Charaka Samhita]] delve further into the issue of homosexuality, stating that homosexuals are conceived when the father's semen is scanty and transgender people are conceived when the father and mother reverse roles during intercourse (''purushayita'', \"woman on top\").<ref>[https://www.galva108.org/single-post/2014/05/15/Homosexuality-Hinduism-the-Third-Gender-A-Summary Homosexuality, Hinduism & the Third Gender (A Summary)]</ref><ref>[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2009/04/gay-homosexuality-vaishnavism Vaishnavism and homosexuality]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire]], a number of the preexisting [[Delhi Sultanate]] laws were combined into the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], mandating a common set of punishments for [[zina]] (unlawful intercourse).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kugle|first1=Scott A|title=Sufis and Saints' Bodies: Mysticism, Corporeality, and Sacred Power in Islam|date=1 Sep 2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|location=Chapter 4 - Note 62-63|isbn=9780807872772|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ1vpC_SeLcC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> These could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n57/mode/2up A digest of the Moohummudan law] pp. 1-3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42157/how-did-the-mughals-view-homosexuality|title=How did the Mughals view homosexuality?|website=History Stack Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/810007/from-bulleh-shah-and-shah-hussain-to-amir-khusro-same-sex-references-abound-in-islamic-sufi-poetry|title=From Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain to Amir Khusro, same-sex references abound in Islamic poetry|work=Scroll.in|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=7 September 2018|last=Khalid|first=Haroon|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.diarna.org/site/detail/public/1931/|title=Sarmad Kashani Tomb in Jami Masjid, New Delhi, India - Archive - Diarna.org|website=archive.diarna.org}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b7-bAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32|title=Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Sarman|author=V.

Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The [[Kama Sutra]], a [[Sanskrit]] text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term ''tritiya-prakriti'' to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (''svairini'', who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as ''kami'' or ''paksha''), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Samhita and the [[Charaka Samhita]] delve further into the issue of homosexuality, stating that homosexuals are conceived when the father's semen is scanty and transgender people are conceived when the father and mother reverse roles during intercourse (''purushayita'', \"woman on top\").<ref>[https://www.galva108.org/single-post/2014/05/15/Homosexuality-Hinduism-the-Third-Gender-A-Summary Homosexuality, Hinduism & the Third Gender (A Summary)]</ref><ref>[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2009/04/gay-homosexuality-vaishnavism Vaishnavism and homosexuality]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire]], a number of the preexisting [[Delhi Sultanate]] laws were combined into the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], mandating a common set of punishments for [[zina]] (unlawful intercourse).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kugle|first1=Scott A|title=Sufis and Saints' Bodies: Mysticism, Corporeality, and Sacred Power in Islam|date=1 Sep 2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|location=Chapter 4 - Note 62-63|isbn=9780807872772|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ1vpC_SeLcC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> These could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n57/mode/2up A digest of the Moohummudan law] pp. 1-3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42157/how-did-the-mughals-view-homosexuality|title=How did the Mughals view homosexuality?|website=History Stack Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/810007/from-bulleh-shah-and-shah-hussain-to-amir-khusro-same-sex-references-abound-in-islamic-sufi-poetry|title=From Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain to Amir Khusro, same-sex references abound in Islamic poetry|work=Scroll.in|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=7 September 2018|last=Khalid|first=Haroon|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.diarna.org/site/detail/public/1931/|title=Sarmad Kashani Tomb in Jami Masjid, New Delhi, India - Archive - Diarna.org|website=archive.diarna.org}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b7-bAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32|title=Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Sarman|author=V.

{"title_page": "Political corruption", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=January 2014}}\n{{Political corruption sidebar}}\n\n'''Political corruption''' is the use of powers by government officials or their network contacts for illegitimate private gain.\n\nForms of [[corruption]] vary, but include [[bribery]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[parochialism]], [[patronage]], [[influence peddling]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. Corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[Human trafficking]], though it is not restricted to these activities. Misuse of [[government]] power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is also considered political corruption.\n\nOver time, corruption has been defined differently. For example, in a simple context, while performing work for a government or as a representative, it is unethical to accept a gift. Any free gift could be construed as a scheme to lure the recipient towards some biases. In most cases, the gift is seen as an intention to seek certain favors such as work promotion, tipping in order to win a contract, job or exemption from certain tasks in the case of junior worker handing in the gift to a senior employee who can be key in winning the favor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=Vito|date=1998-12-01|title=Corruption Around the World: Causes, Consequences, Scope, and Cures|journal=Staff Papers|language=en|volume=45|issue=4|pages=559\u2013594|doi=10.2307/3867585|issn=0020-8027|jstor=3867585|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a8e9267b58c496858d3c7c30f657afbcd7cb8e92}}</ref>\n\nSome forms of corruption \u2013 now called \"institutional corruption\"<ref>Thompson, Dennis.

A similar problem of corruption arises in any institution that depends on financial support from people who have interests that may conflict with the primary purpose of the institution.\n\nAn illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties, is done under [[color of law]] or involves [[Influence peddling|trading in influence]]. The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, some political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or ill-defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.\nWorldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title=African corruption 'on the wane'|date=10 July 2007|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning \"rule by thieves\".\n\n==Effects==\n===Effects on politics, administration, and institutions===\n[[File:Countries implicated in the Panama Papers.svg|thumb|260px|Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates implicated in the [[Panama Papers]] leak on April 15, 2016]]\nIn politics, corruption undermines democracy and [[good governance]] by flouting or even subverting formal processes.

When the structure of the health care system is not adequately addressed beginning from oversight in healthcare delivery and supply of drugs and tendering process, mismanagement and misappropriation of funds will always be observed. Corruption also can undermine health care service delivery which in turn disorients the lives of the poor. Corruption leads to violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms as people supposed to benefit from the basic health care from the governments are denied due to unscrupulous processes driven by greed. Therefore, for a country to keep citizens healthy there must be efficient systems and proper resources that can tame the evils like corruption that underpin it.\n\n=== Effects on education ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2018}}\nEducation forms the basis and the fabric in which a society is transformed and different facets of well-being are shaped.Corruption in higher education has been prevalent and calls for immediate intervention. Increased corruption in higher education has led to growing global concern among governments, students and educators and other stakeholders. Those offering services in the higher education institutions are facing pressure that highly threatens the integral value of higher education enterprise. Corruption in higher education has a larger negative influence, it destroys the relation between personal effort and reward anticipation.

Osipian summarized a 2008 \"study of corruption perceptions among Russians ... .30 percent of the respondents marked the level of corruption as very high, while another 44 percent as high. 19 percent considered it as average and only 1 percent as low.

[[Bribery]] requires two participants: one to give the bribe, and one to take it. Either may initiate the corrupt offering; for example, a customs official may demand bribes to let through allowed (or disallowed) goods, or a smuggler might offer bribes to gain passage. In some countries the culture of corruption extends to every aspect of public life, making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without resorting to bribes. Bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do. They may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations. In addition to their role in private financial gain, bribes are also used to intentionally and maliciously cause harm to another (i.e. no financial incentive).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In some developing nations, up to half of the population has paid bribes during the past 12 months.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |title= How common is bribe-paying? |quote=...a relatively high proportion of families in a group of Central Eastern European, African, and Latin American countries paid a bribe in the previous twelve months. |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120405045051/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |archivedate= April 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Council of Europe]] dissociates active and passive bribery and to incriminates them as separate offences:\n\n* One can define '''active bribery''' as \"the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage to any of its public officials, for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions\" (article 2 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url= https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168007f3f5 |title= Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 173 |publisher= Conventions.coe.int |accessdate= 2016-02-28}}</ref> of the [[Council of Europe]]). \n* '''Passive bribery''' can be defined as \"when committed intentionally, the request or receipt by any [...] public officials, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions\" (article 3 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThis dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that bribery is not acceptable.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a \"fee\" to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision. A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174):<ref name=\"conventions\"/>  ''For the purpose of this Convention, \"corruption\" means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof.\n\n===Trading in influence===\n{{Main|Influence peddling}}\n[[File:The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|\"The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler\" (1889)|Reformers like the American [[Joseph Keppler]] depicted the Senate as controlled by the giant moneybags, who represented the nation's financial trusts and monopolies.]]\nTrading in influence, or [[influence peddling]], refers a person selling his/her influence over the decision making process to benefit a third party (person or institution). The difference with bribery is that this is a tri-lateral relation. From a legal point of view, the role of the third party (who is the target of the influence) does not really matter although he/she can be an accessory in some instances. It can be difficult to make a distinction between this form of corruption and some forms of extreme and loosely regulated [[lobbying]] where for instance law- or decision-makers can freely \"sell\" their vote, decision power or influence to those lobbyists who offer the highest compensation, including where for instance the latter act on behalf of powerful clients such as industrial groups who want to avoid the passing of specific environmental, social, or other regulations perceived as too stringent, etc. Where lobbying is (sufficiently) regulated, it becomes possible to provide for a distinctive criteria and to consider that trading in influence involves the use of \"improper influence\", as in article 12 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> of the [[Council of Europe]].\n\n===Patronage===\n{{Main|Patronage}}\n[[Patronage]] refers to favoring supporters, for example with government employment. This may be legitimate, as when a newly elected government changes the top officials in the administration in order to effectively implement its policy. It can be seen as corruption if this means that incompetent persons, as a payment for supporting the regime, are selected before more able ones. In nondemocracies many government officials are often selected for loyalty rather than ability. They may be almost exclusively selected from a particular group (for example, [[Sunni]] Arabs in [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq, the [[nomenklatura]] in the [[Soviet Union]], or the [[Junker]]s in [[Imperial Germany]]) that support the regime in return for such favors. A similar problem can also be seen in Eastern Europe, for example in [[Romania]], where the government is often accused of [[patronage]] (when a new government comes to power it rapidly changes most of the officials in the public sector).<ref>{{cite news|last=Gallagher |first=Tom |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443792604577572910124653818 |title=The EU Can't Ignore Its Romania Problem |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}</ref>\n<!-- The above was replaced 2014-09-03 with the following reference to Pakistan.

This may be combined with [[bribery]], for example demanding that a business should employ a [[kinship|relative]] of an official controlling regulations affecting the business. The most extreme example is when the entire state is inherited, as in [[North Korea]] or [[Syria]]. A lesser form might be in the Southern United States with [[Good ol' boy]]s, where women and minorities are excluded. A milder form of cronyism is an \"[[old boy network]]\", in which appointees to official positions are selected only from a closed and exclusive social network \u2013 such as the alumni of particular universities \u2013 instead of appointing the most competent candidate.\n\nSeeking to harm enemies becomes corruption when official powers are illegitimately used as means to this end.

Acts of [[fraud]] affect vote counts to bring about an election result, whether by increasing the vote share of the favored candidate, depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Also called '''voter fraud''', the mechanisms involved include illegal voter registration, intimidation at polls, voting computer [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]], and improper vote counting.\n\n===Embezzlement===\n{{Main|Embezzlement}}\n[[Embezzlement]] is the theft of entrusted funds. It is political when it involves public money taken by a public official for use by anyone not specified by the public. A common type of embezzlement is that of personal use of entrusted government resources; for example, when an official assigns public employees to renovate his own house.\n\n===Kickbacks===\n{{main|Kickback (bribery)}}\n{{see also|Anti-competitive practices|Bid rigging|Fraud|Charbonneau Commission}}\nA [[Money trail|kickback]] is an official's share of misappropriated funds allocated from his or her organization to an organization involved in corrupt [[bidding]]. For example, suppose that a politician is in charge of choosing how to spend some public funds. He can give a [[contract]] to a [[General contractor|company]] that is not the best bidder, or allocate more than they deserve. In this case, the company benefits, and in exchange for betraying the public, the official receives a kickback payment, which is a portion of the sum the company received. This sum itself may be all or a portion of the difference between the actual (inflated) payment to the company and the (lower) market-based price that would have been paid had the bidding been competitive.\n\nAnother example of a kickback would be if a judge receives a portion of the profits that a business makes in exchange for his judicial decisions.\n\nKickbacks are not limited to government officials; any situation in which people are entrusted to spend funds that do not belong to them are susceptible to this kind of corruption.\n\n===Unholy alliance===\n{{Main|Unholy alliance (geopolitical)}}\nAn [[Unholy alliance (geopolitical)|unholy alliance]] is a coalition among seemingly antagonistic groups for [[ad hoc]] or hidden gain, generally some influential non-governmental group forming ties with political parties, supplying funding in exchange for the favorable treatment.

Complicated regulations and arbitrary, unsupervised official conduct exacerbate the problem. This is one argument for [[privatization]] and [[deregulation]]. Opponents of privatization see the argument as ideological. The argument that corruption necessarily follows from the opportunity is weakened by the existence of countries with low to non-existent corruption but large public sectors, like the [[Nordic countries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs110 |title=Lessons From the North|publisher=Project Syndicate |date= 2006-04-21|accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> These countries score high on the [[Ease of Doing Business Index]], due to good and often simple regulations and have [[rule of law]] firmly established. Therefore, due to their lack of corruption in the first place, they can run large public sectors without inducing political corruption. Recent evidence that takes both the size of expenditures and regulatory complexity into account has found that high-income democracies with more expansive state sectors do indeed have higher levels of corruption.<ref name=\"www-wds.worldbank\" />\n\nLike other governmental economic activities, also privatization, such as in the sale of government-owned property, is particularly at the risk of cronyism. Privatizations in Russia, Latin America, and East Germany were accompanied by large-scale corruption during the sale of the state-owned companies. Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have reported widely the grand corruption that accompanied the sales, studies have argued that in addition to increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that extralegal and unofficial activities are more prevalent in countries that privatized less.<ref>Privatization in Competitive Sectors: The Record to Date.

An effect is that distribution of funds in multiple instances discourages embezzlement because even small sums missing will be noticed. In contrast, in a centralized authority, even minute proportions of public funds can be large sums of money.\n\n==Governmental corruption==\n[[File:Imee and Ferdinand Marcos during the latter's 21 year reign as Philippine president.jpg|thumb|[[Ferdinand Marcos]] was a Philippine dictator and [[Kleptocracy|kleptocrat]].

The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways: violation of company policy/rules, law, regulation, or threat to public interest/national security, as well as fraud, and corruption. Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to the surface either internally or externally. Internally, a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor. Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media, government, law enforcement, or those who are concerned. Whistleblowers, however, take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing.\n\nBecause of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on private sector, or public sector. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.\n\nDeeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an ethical approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of ongoing ethical debate. Leading arguments in the ideological camp that whistleblowing is ethical to maintain that whistleblowing is a form of civil disobedience, and aims to protect the public from government wrongdoing. In the opposite camp, some see whistleblowing as unethical for breaching confidentiality, especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information. Legal protection can also be granted to protect whistleblowers, but that protection is subject to many stipulations. Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave whistleblowers vulnerable to retaliation and legal trouble. However, the decision and action have become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and communication. Whistleblowers frequently face reprisal, sometimes at the hands of the organization or group they have accused, sometimes from related organizations, and sometimes under law. Questions about the legitimacy of whistleblowing, the moral responsibility of whistleblowing, and the appraisal of the institutions of whistleblowing are part of the field of political ethics.\n{{empty section|date=November 2018}}\nSourced from main Wikipedia article.\n\n==Measuring corruption==\nMeasuring corruption accurately is difficult if not impossible due to the illicit nature of the transaction and imprecise definitions of corruption.<ref name=\"commons.globalintegrity.org\">{{cite web |url=http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |title=A Users' Guide to Measuring Corruption |publisher=[[Global Integrity]] |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131012755/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 }}</ref> Few reliable measures of the magnitude of corruption exists and among those, there is a high level of heterogeneity.

Of course, the advocates of the commission acknowledge that the regulated companies will need some compensation for this new public vigilance. So they propose a compromise: in exchange for accepting the commission, all city franchises will be extended by 50 years.

For example, in a simple context, while performing work for a government or as a representative, it is unethical to accept a gift. Any free gift could be construed as a scheme to lure the recipient towards some biases. In most cases, the gift is seen as an intention to seek certain favors such as work promotion, tipping in order to win a contract, job or exemption from certain tasks in the case of junior worker handing in the gift to a senior employee who can be key in winning the favor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=Vito|date=1998-12-01|title=Corruption Around the World: Causes, Consequences, Scope, and Cures|journal=Staff Papers|language=en|volume=45|issue=4|pages=559\u2013594|doi=10.2307/3867585|issn=0020-8027|jstor=3867585|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a8e9267b58c496858d3c7c30f657afbcd7cb8e92}}</ref>\n\nSome forms of corruption \u2013 now called \"institutional corruption\"<ref>Thompson, Dennis.

A similar problem of corruption arises in any institution that depends on financial support from people who have interests that may conflict with the primary purpose of the institution.\n\nAn illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties, is done under [[color of law]] or involves [[Influence peddling|trading in influence]]. The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, some political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or ill-defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.\nWorldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title=African corruption 'on the wane'|date=10 July 2007|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning \"rule by thieves\".\n\n==Effects==\n===Effects on politics, administration, and institutions===\n[[File:Countries implicated in the Panama Papers.svg|thumb|260px|Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates implicated in the [[Panama Papers]] leak on April 15, 2016]]\nIn politics, corruption undermines democracy and [[good governance]] by flouting or even subverting formal processes.

[[Bribery]] requires two participants: one to give the bribe, and one to take it. Either may initiate the corrupt offering; for example, a customs official may demand bribes to let through allowed (or disallowed) goods, or a smuggler might offer bribes to gain passage. In some countries the culture of corruption extends to every aspect of public life, making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without resorting to bribes. Bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do. They may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations. In addition to their role in private financial gain, bribes are also used to intentionally and maliciously cause harm to another (i.e. no financial incentive).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In some developing nations, up to half of the population has paid bribes during the past 12 months.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |title= How common is bribe-paying? |quote=...a relatively high proportion of families in a group of Central Eastern European, African, and Latin American countries paid a bribe in the previous twelve months. |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120405045051/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |archivedate= April 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Council of Europe]] dissociates active and passive bribery and to incriminates them as separate offences:\n\n* One can define '''active bribery''' as \"the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage to any of its public officials, for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions\" (article 2 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url= https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168007f3f5 |title= Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 173 |publisher= Conventions.coe.int |accessdate= 2016-02-28}}</ref> of the [[Council of Europe]]). \n* '''Passive bribery''' can be defined as \"when committed intentionally, the request or receipt by any [...] public officials, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions\" (article 3 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThis dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that bribery is not acceptable.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a \"fee\" to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision. A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174):<ref name=\"conventions\"/>  ''For the purpose of this Convention, \"corruption\" means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof.\n\n===Trading in influence===\n{{Main|Influence peddling}}\n[[File:The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|\"The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler\" (1889)|Reformers like the American [[Joseph Keppler]] depicted the Senate as controlled by the giant moneybags, who represented the nation's financial trusts and monopolies.]]\nTrading in influence, or [[influence peddling]], refers a person selling his/her influence over the decision making process to benefit a third party (person or institution). The difference with bribery is that this is a tri-lateral relation. From a legal point of view, the role of the third party (who is the target of the influence) does not really matter although he/she can be an accessory in some instances. It can be difficult to make a distinction between this form of corruption and some forms of extreme and loosely regulated [[lobbying]] where for instance law- or decision-makers can freely \"sell\" their vote, decision power or influence to those lobbyists who offer the highest compensation, including where for instance the latter act on behalf of powerful clients such as industrial groups who want to avoid the passing of specific environmental, social, or other regulations perceived as too stringent, etc. Where lobbying is (sufficiently) regulated, it becomes possible to provide for a distinctive criteria and to consider that trading in influence involves the use of \"improper influence\", as in article 12 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> of the [[Council of Europe]].\n\n===Patronage===\n{{Main|Patronage}}\n[[Patronage]] refers to favoring supporters, for example with government employment. This may be legitimate, as when a newly elected government changes the top officials in the administration in order to effectively implement its policy. It can be seen as corruption if this means that incompetent persons, as a payment for supporting the regime, are selected before more able ones. In nondemocracies many government officials are often selected for loyalty rather than ability. They may be almost exclusively selected from a particular group (for example, [[Sunni]] Arabs in [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq, the [[nomenklatura]] in the [[Soviet Union]], or the [[Junker]]s in [[Imperial Germany]]) that support the regime in return for such favors. A similar problem can also be seen in Eastern Europe, for example in [[Romania]], where the government is often accused of [[patronage]] (when a new government comes to power it rapidly changes most of the officials in the public sector).<ref>{{cite news|last=Gallagher |first=Tom |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443792604577572910124653818 |title=The EU Can't Ignore Its Romania Problem |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}</ref>\n<!-- The above was replaced 2014-09-03 with the following reference to Pakistan.

This may be combined with [[bribery]], for example demanding that a business should employ a [[kinship|relative]] of an official controlling regulations affecting the business. The most extreme example is when the entire state is inherited, as in [[North Korea]] or [[Syria]]. A lesser form might be in the Southern United States with [[Good ol' boy]]s, where women and minorities are excluded. A milder form of cronyism is an \"[[old boy network]]\", in which appointees to official positions are selected only from a closed and exclusive social network \u2013 such as the alumni of particular universities \u2013 instead of appointing the most competent candidate.\n\nSeeking to harm enemies becomes corruption when official powers are illegitimately used as means to this end. For example, trumped-up charges are often brought up against journalists or writers who bring up politically sensitive issues, such as a politician's acceptance of bribes.\n\n===Gombeenism and parochialism===\n{{Main|Gombeen man|Parochialism}}\n[[Gombeen man|Gombeenism]] refers to an individual who is dishonest and corrupt for the purpose of personal gain, more often through monetary, while, [[parochialism]] which is also known as parish pump politics relates to placing local or vanity projects ahead of the national interest.<ref>{{cite book |first=R.

Acts of [[fraud]] affect vote counts to bring about an election result, whether by increasing the vote share of the favored candidate, depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Also called '''voter fraud''', the mechanisms involved include illegal voter registration, intimidation at polls, voting computer [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]], and improper vote counting.\n\n===Embezzlement===\n{{Main|Embezzlement}}\n[[Embezzlement]] is the theft of entrusted funds. It is political when it involves public money taken by a public official for use by anyone not specified by the public. A common type of embezzlement is that of personal use of entrusted government resources; for example, when an official assigns public employees to renovate his own house.\n\n===Kickbacks===\n{{main|Kickback (bribery)}}\n{{see also|Anti-competitive practices|Bid rigging|Fraud|Charbonneau Commission}}\nA [[Money trail|kickback]] is an official's share of misappropriated funds allocated from his or her organization to an organization involved in corrupt [[bidding]]. For example, suppose that a politician is in charge of choosing how to spend some public funds. He can give a [[contract]] to a [[General contractor|company]] that is not the best bidder, or allocate more than they deserve. In this case, the company benefits, and in exchange for betraying the public, the official receives a kickback payment, which is a portion of the sum the company received. This sum itself may be all or a portion of the difference between the actual (inflated) payment to the company and the (lower) market-based price that would have been paid had the bidding been competitive.\n\nAnother example of a kickback would be if a judge receives a portion of the profits that a business makes in exchange for his judicial decisions.\n\nKickbacks are not limited to government officials; any situation in which people are entrusted to spend funds that do not belong to them are susceptible to this kind of corruption.\n\n===Unholy alliance===\n{{Main|Unholy alliance (geopolitical)}}\nAn [[Unholy alliance (geopolitical)|unholy alliance]] is a coalition among seemingly antagonistic groups for [[ad hoc]] or hidden gain, generally some influential non-governmental group forming ties with political parties, supplying funding in exchange for the favorable treatment. Like patronage, unholy alliances are not necessarily illegal, but unlike patronage, by its deceptive nature and often great financial resources, an unholy alliance can be much more dangerous to the [[public interest]].

Complicated regulations and arbitrary, unsupervised official conduct exacerbate the problem. This is one argument for [[privatization]] and [[deregulation]]. Opponents of privatization see the argument as ideological. The argument that corruption necessarily follows from the opportunity is weakened by the existence of countries with low to non-existent corruption but large public sectors, like the [[Nordic countries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs110 |title=Lessons From the North|publisher=Project Syndicate |date= 2006-04-21|accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> These countries score high on the [[Ease of Doing Business Index]], due to good and often simple regulations and have [[rule of law]] firmly established. Therefore, due to their lack of corruption in the first place, they can run large public sectors without inducing political corruption. Recent evidence that takes both the size of expenditures and regulatory complexity into account has found that high-income democracies with more expansive state sectors do indeed have higher levels of corruption.<ref name=\"www-wds.worldbank\" />\n\nLike other governmental economic activities, also privatization, such as in the sale of government-owned property, is particularly at the risk of cronyism. Privatizations in Russia, Latin America, and East Germany were accompanied by large-scale corruption during the sale of the state-owned companies. Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have reported widely the grand corruption that accompanied the sales, studies have argued that in addition to increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that extralegal and unofficial activities are more prevalent in countries that privatized less.<ref>Privatization in Competitive Sectors: The Record to Date.

An effect is that distribution of funds in multiple instances discourages embezzlement because even small sums missing will be noticed. In contrast, in a centralized authority, even minute proportions of public funds can be large sums of money.\n\n==Governmental corruption==\n[[File:Imee and Ferdinand Marcos during the latter's 21 year reign as Philippine president.jpg|thumb|[[Ferdinand Marcos]] was a Philippine dictator and [[Kleptocracy|kleptocrat]].

The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways: violation of company policy/rules, law, regulation, or threat to public interest/national security, as well as fraud, and corruption. Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to the surface either internally or externally. Internally, a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor. Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media, government, law enforcement, or those who are concerned. Whistleblowers, however, take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing.\n\nBecause of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on private sector, or public sector. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.\n\nDeeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an ethical approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of ongoing ethical debate. Leading arguments in the ideological camp that whistleblowing is ethical to maintain that whistleblowing is a form of civil disobedience, and aims to protect the public from government wrongdoing. In the opposite camp, some see whistleblowing as unethical for breaching confidentiality, especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information. Legal protection can also be granted to protect whistleblowers, but that protection is subject to many stipulations. Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave whistleblowers vulnerable to retaliation and legal trouble. However, the decision and action have become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and communication. Whistleblowers frequently face reprisal, sometimes at the hands of the organization or group they have accused, sometimes from related organizations, and sometimes under law. Questions about the legitimacy of whistleblowing, the moral responsibility of whistleblowing, and the appraisal of the institutions of whistleblowing are part of the field of political ethics.\n{{empty section|date=November 2018}}\nSourced from main Wikipedia article.\n\n==Measuring corruption==\nMeasuring corruption accurately is difficult if not impossible due to the illicit nature of the transaction and imprecise definitions of corruption.<ref name=\"commons.globalintegrity.org\">{{cite web |url=http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |title=A Users' Guide to Measuring Corruption |publisher=[[Global Integrity]] |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131012755/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 }}</ref> Few reliable measures of the magnitude of corruption exists and among those, there is a high level of heterogeneity.
