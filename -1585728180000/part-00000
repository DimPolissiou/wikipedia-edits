Owned and operated by [[Cedar Fair]], it originally opened in 1976 as one of two parks built by the [[Marriott Corporation]]. The park has appeared in 1994 films ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'' and ''[[Getting Even with Dad]]'' and features over 40 rides and attractions. One of its most notable attractions, [[Gold Striker]], has been featured as a top-ranked wooden roller coaster in ''[[Amusement Today|Amusement Today's]]'' annual Golden Ticket Awards publication. Also featured is Railblazer, one of the first Raptor roller coasters by [[Rocky Mountain Construction]] in the world, and Flight Deck, a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] inverted coaster.\n\n==History==\n\n===Marriott & KECO Era (1976\u20131992)===\nMarriott's Great America, built by hotel and restaurant operator [[Marriott Corporation]], opened to the public on March 20, 1976.<ref>{{cite news |title=Photos: A look back at 40 years of California's Great America |date=March 27, 2015 |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2015/03/27/photos-a-look-back-at-40-years-of-californias-great-america/}}</ref> Less than two months later on May 29, the company opened a second Marriott's Great America&nbsp;\u2013 later known as [[Six Flags Great America]]&nbsp;\u2013 north of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in [[Gurnee, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Six Flags purchase\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/27/business/marriott-to-sell-park-to-bally.html|title=Marriott to Sell Park to Bally|date=April 27, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> [[Marriott's Great America (Maryland\u2013Virginia)|A third park]] was initially planned for the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area]], but the idea was later abandoned after several failed attempts to sway local opposition.<ref name=\"3rd Great America\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19770819&id=j95NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ooDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5660,2451015|title=Marriott's high-powered approach|last=Flattau|first=Edward|date=August 19, 1977|work=The Free Lance-Star|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Great america.jpg|thumb|left|View of California's Great America from above]]\nThe park, though profitable, was still an earnings disappointment for Marriott, leading the company in 1983 to explore options to sell. An interested party, '''Caz Development Co.''', appraised the land value at US$800,000 to $1 million per acre. Marriott also involved the city of Santa Clara in negotiations, which was already leasing {{convert|55|acre}} of parking space for the amusement park. Fearing homebuilding on the land by Caz Development would lower home values of existing homeowners, the city council approved a $101 million purchasing agreement on January 31, 1984, by a 4\u20133 vote that also had to be approved by city residents. The citywide vote passed, approving the sale by a margin of 3 to 1. Caz Development then sued the city and Marriott in the [[Superior Court of Santa Clara County]] to block the transaction. The court nullified the sale, forcing the city to attempt to salvage the deal through negotiations with the other parties. Unable to broker a timely agreement, the city council voted 6\u20131 to scuttle the sale on February 5, 1985, though the city was still interested in owning the park. After Marriott refunded a $20 million down payment back to the city, negotiations were restarted. All parties were able to agree on a compromise, which was signed in marathon sessions taking place in early June 1985. The city acquired the park for $93.5 million from Marriott, which retained {{convert|20|acre}} from the sale for development. Caz Development settled and was allowed to build a hotel and office near the park, which the city renamed Great America.\n\n[[Kings Entertainment Company]], who owned and operated other amusement parks, was hired in 1985 to manage Great America for the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1948&dat=19850620&id=KNZJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aB0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1152,5468771|title=A New Start At Great America|date=June 20, 1985|work=The Modesto Bee|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Modesto, CA}}</ref> In 1989, the city decided to return the park to the private sector and sold it to Kings Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1992&dat=19890606&id=W5VcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IlgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5086,1057726|title=Firm Acquires Big Theme Park|date=June 6, 1989|work=Merced Sun-Star|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Merced, California}}</ref> In the agreement, the city would earn 5% of all revenue that exceeds $56 million.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Paramount Parks Era (1992\u20132006)===\n[[Image:Paramountgreatamerica.jpg|thumb|right|Logo used from 2003 until its sale to Cedar Fair.]]\nThree years later Paramount Communications (formerly [[Gulf+Western]]), the owners of [[Paramount Pictures]], sought to join other entertainment companies as a theme park owner. The company acquired Kings Entertainment, owner of three parks including Great America, and one other park for $400 million and created [[Paramount Parks]]. [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], the parent of [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] (including [[Nickelodeon]]), then bought Paramount in 1994, allowing Nickelodeon theming and merchandise into the park as well. During the Paramount era, attractions from the Action FX Theatre, Nickelodeon Splat City (later Nickelodeon Central), Drop Zone Stunt Tower, Invertigo, and many more modern thrill ride attractions were added in. Because the park is landlocked in the center of Silicon Valley, several rides including the classic train ride and the [[Sky Whirl]], a Marriott's Great America signature attraction, were removed to make way for newer attractions.\n\nIn its last years as a Paramount Park, Great America was co-owned with several broadcasting stations in the Bay Area, including [[KPIX-TV]] and [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]].\n\n===Cedar Fair Entertainment Company (2006\u2013present)===\n[[Image:Great America 2007.PNG|thumb|right|Logo used in 2006.

He was told that each of the rides he had designed would cost about $10 million to build and the whole film would cost about $70 million. When box office results for ''[[The Distinguished Gentleman]]'' came in, Paramount ordered the budget to be cut to $55 million.\n\nSome modifications were made to the Columbia Carousel and Vortex roller coaster. Most of the Sky Whirl/Triple Wheel stunts (renamed \"The Spider\" for the film) were filmed in a studio. To film the exterior scenes, the motors of the Triple Wheel were left unpowered; instead, to ensure the ride did not move too quickly, some cages were loaded with sandbags to unbalance the mechanism.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/article/1994/06/10/eddie-murphys-dangerous-ride/ |title=Eddie Murphy's dangerous ride |author=Mannes, George |date=June 10, 1994 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> In this scene, [[George Lucas]] has a small part as the man Axel cuts in front of to get on the ride, also known as 'disappointed man' (this can be seen in the credits).

Also, the carousel at the back of the park (the Ameri-Go-Round, not the Columbia Carousel) was altered. The Ameri-Go-Round carousel has since been removed and Drop Zone is now in its place. The tunnels that supposedly ran under the park are a myth as well. No tunnels run under the park, as many thought after this was released.\n\nThe Alien Attack ride featured in the Wonder World theme park was in fact the \"Earthquake: The Big One attraction\" from the [[Universal Studios Florida]] theme park in [[Orlando, Florida]]. The \"aliens\" featured in the ride are suited actors (and not animatronic as suggested in the film) that closely resembled the Cylons from the original Battlestar Galactica.<ref name=TPI-131116>{{cite web |url=https://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201311/3778/ |title=Theme Park History: 10 top movies or TV shows filmed in theme parks |author=Potter, Derek |date=November 16, 2013 |website=Theme Park Insider |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Other film and television===\n* Paramount's Great America was also used as the theme park [[Macaulay Culkin]] visits in the 1994 film ''[[Getting Even with Dad]]'' (not released by Paramount Pictures but rather [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://greatamericanthrills.net/2014/08/24/getting-even-with-dad-filmed-at-californias-great-america/ |title=Getting Even With Dad Filmed at California's Great America |author=Rowberry, Kris |date=August 24, 2014 |website=Great American Thrills |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n* The park's inverted steel coaster \"Top Gun\" (later renamed to \"Flight Deck\") was featured in a 2007 [[Excedrin]] commercial with music from [[The Stremes]].<ref>{{youtube |id=Nw-d5OZOWA0 |title=Excedrin TV Advert - Music by The Stremes}}</ref>\n* Marriott's Great America was used in the 1983 George Lucas and [[John Korty]] animated feature [[Twice Upon a Time (1983 film)|''Twice Upon A Time'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/58153 |title=Twice Upon a Time (1983) |publisher=AFI Catalog of Feature Films |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> It was used both as a background for animated scenes and for a short live-action shot at the end of the film.\n\n==Incidents==\n{{Main|Incidents at Cedar Fair parks}}\n* In 1980, a 13-year-old boy was killed and several others injured on the [[Whizzer (roller coaster)|Willard's Whizzer]] roller coaster. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/06/13/previous-accidents-at-great-america/|title=Previous accidents at Great America|last=Kaplan|first=Tracy|date=June 13, 2015|work=San Jose Mercury News|access-date=March 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* In 1989, two boys intentionally jumped out of the Loggers' Run ride.

Also featured is Railblazer, one of the first Raptor roller coasters by [Rocky Mountain Construction]] in the World, and Flight Deck, a [Bolliger & Mabillard] inverted coaster.\n\n==History==\n\n===Marriott & KECO Era (1976\u20131992)===\nMarriott's Great America, built by hotel and restaurant operator [[Marriott Corporation]], opened to the public on March 20, 1976.<ref>{{cite news |title=Photos: A look back at 40 years of California's Great America |date=March 27, 2015 |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2015/03/27/photos-a-look-back-at-40-years-of-californias-great-america/}}</ref> Less than two months later on May 29, the company opened a second Marriott's Great America&nbsp;\u2013 later known as [[Six Flags Great America]]&nbsp;\u2013 north of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in [[Gurnee, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Six Flags purchase\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/27/business/marriott-to-sell-park-to-bally.html|title=Marriott to Sell Park to Bally|date=April 27, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> [[Marriott's Great America (Maryland\u2013Virginia)|A third park]] was initially planned for the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area]], but the idea was later abandoned after several failed attempts to sway local opposition.<ref name=\"3rd Great America\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19770819&id=j95NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ooDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5660,2451015|title=Marriott's high-powered approach|last=Flattau|first=Edward|date=August 19, 1977|work=The Free Lance-Star|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Great america.jpg|thumb|left|View of California's Great America from above]]\nThe park, though profitable, was still an earnings disappointment for Marriott, leading the company in 1983 to explore options to sell. An interested party, '''Caz Development Co.''', appraised the land value at US$800,000 to $1 million per acre. Marriott also involved the city of Santa Clara in negotiations, which was already leasing {{convert|55|acre}} of parking space for the amusement park. Fearing homebuilding on the land by Caz Development would lower home values of existing homeowners, the city council approved a $101 million purchasing agreement on January 31, 1984, by a 4\u20133 vote that also had to be approved by city residents. The citywide vote passed, approving the sale by a margin of 3 to 1. Caz Development then sued the city and Marriott in the [[Superior Court of Santa Clara County]] to block the transaction. The court nullified the sale, forcing the city to attempt to salvage the deal through negotiations with the other parties. Unable to broker a timely agreement, the city council voted 6\u20131 to scuttle the sale on February 5, 1985, though the city was still interested in owning the park. After Marriott refunded a $20 million down payment back to the city, negotiations were restarted. All parties were able to agree on a compromise, which was signed in marathon sessions taking place in early June 1985. The city acquired the park for $93.5 million from Marriott, which retained {{convert|20|acre}} from the sale for development. Caz Development settled and was allowed to build a hotel and office near the park, which the city renamed Great America.\n\n[[Kings Entertainment Company]], who owned and operated other amusement parks, was hired in 1985 to manage Great America for the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1948&dat=19850620&id=KNZJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aB0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1152,5468771|title=A New Start At Great America|date=June 20, 1985|work=The Modesto Bee|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Modesto, CA}}</ref> In 1989, the city decided to return the park to the private sector and sold it to Kings Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1992&dat=19890606&id=W5VcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IlgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5086,1057726|title=Firm Acquires Big Theme Park|date=June 6, 1989|work=Merced Sun-Star|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Merced, California}}</ref> In the agreement, the city would earn 5% of all revenue that exceeds $56 million.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Paramount Parks Era (1992\u20132006)===\n[[Image:Paramountgreatamerica.jpg|thumb|right|Logo used from 2003 until its sale to Cedar Fair.]]\nThree years later Paramount Communications (formerly [[Gulf+Western]]), the owners of [[Paramount Pictures]], sought to join other entertainment companies as a theme park owner. The company acquired Kings Entertainment, owner of three parks including Great America, and one other park for $400 million and created [[Paramount Parks]]. [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], the parent of [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] (including [[Nickelodeon]]), then bought Paramount in 1994, allowing Nickelodeon theming and merchandise into the park as well. During the Paramount era, attractions from the Action FX Theatre, Nickelodeon Splat City (later Nickelodeon Central), Drop Zone Stunt Tower, Invertigo, and many more modern thrill ride attractions were added in. Because the park is landlocked in the center of Silicon Valley, several rides including the classic train ride and the [[Sky Whirl]], a Marriott's Great America signature attraction, were removed to make way for newer attractions.\n\nIn its last years as a Paramount Park, Great America was co-owned with several broadcasting stations in the Bay Area, including [[KPIX-TV]] and [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]].\n\n===Cedar Fair Entertainment Company (2006\u2013present)===\n[[Image:Great America 2007.PNG|thumb|right|Logo used in 2006.

He was told that each of the rides he had designed would cost about $10 million to build and the whole film would cost about $70 million. When box office results for ''[[The Distinguished Gentleman]]'' came in, Paramount ordered the budget to be cut to $55 million.\n\nSome modifications were made to the Columbia Carousel and Vortex roller coaster. Most of the Sky Whirl/Triple Wheel stunts (renamed \"The Spider\" for the film) were filmed in a studio. To film the exterior scenes, the motors of the Triple Wheel were left unpowered; instead, to ensure the ride did not move too quickly, some cages were loaded with sandbags to unbalance the mechanism.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/article/1994/06/10/eddie-murphys-dangerous-ride/ |title=Eddie Murphy's dangerous ride |author=Mannes, George |date=June 10, 1994 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> In this scene, [[George Lucas]] has a small part as the man Axel cuts in front of to get on the ride, also known as 'disappointed man' (this can be seen in the credits).

The tunnels that supposedly ran under the park are a myth as well. No tunnels run under the park, as many thought after this was released.\n\nThe Alien Attack ride featured in the Wonder World theme park was in fact the \"Earthquake: The Big One attraction\" from the [[Universal Studios Florida]] theme park in [[Orlando, Florida]].

He is best known for his work on the Canadian [[sketch comedy]] ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' from 1976 to 1984 (on which he also served as a writer), and as Harold Weir on ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]''.\n\n==Life and career==\nJoseph O'Flaherty<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/51/Joe-Flaherty.html Joe Flaherty Biography (1941-)]</ref> was born in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], the son of a production clerk at Westinghouse Electric. His father was of Irish heritage and his mother was of Italian descent.<ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/the-worrier-in-the-comic-mask/article1001345/</ref>\n\nHe moved to [[Chicago]], where he started his comedy career with the [[The Second City|Second City]] Theater as Joe O'Flaherty. Along with several other Second City performers, he began appearing on the ''[[National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' from 1973 to 1974. After seven years in Chicago, he moved to [[Toronto]] to help establish the Toronto Second City theatre troupe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secondcity.com/people/other/joe-flaherty/|title=The Second City \u2013 Joe Flaherty|website=The Second City|accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref> During those years, he was one of the original writer/performers on ''SCTV'', where he spent eight years on the show, playing such characters as Big Jim McBob (of ''Farm Film Report'' fame), [[Count Floyd]]/[[Floyd Robertson]], and station owner/manager [[Guy Caballero]] who goes around in a [[wheelchair]] only for respect.\n\nOther memorable Flaherty characterizations included emotional talk show host Sammy Maudlin, seedy saxophonist-private eye Vic Arpeggio, aggressive elocution lecturer Norman Gorman, myopic public television host Hugh Betcha, and \"crazy as a snake\" ex-convict Rocco.\n\n''SCTV'' ceased production in 1984. The same year, Flaherty played Count Floyd in a short-film that was shown at concerts by the rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] before the song \"The Weapon\", for their tour in support of ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'' (and can be seen in the home video, ''[[Grace Under Pressure Tour (video)|Grace Under Pressure Tour]]'').\n\nFlaherty has appeared in a number of cult favorite films, for example, playing the part of the [[Western Union]] postal worker who delivers [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown's]] 70-year-old letter to [[Marty McFly]] in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989), as well as the crazed fan yelling \"jackass!\" in ''[[Happy Gilmore]]''. In [[Family Guy (season 8)|season eight]] of ''[[Family Guy]]'', Flaherty once again played the Western Union man in \"[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]\". He likewise satirizes his ''Back to the Future Part II'' character in \"[[The Big Bang Theory (Family Guy)|The Big Bang Theory]]\", this time playing a Vatican worker whose role is essentially identical to that of his Western Union character.\n\nIn 1989, Flaherty played a guest role in ''[[Married... with Children]]'' in season-four episode \"Tooth or Consequences\", as a recently divorced dentist who must repair Al Bundy's teeth.\n\nDuring 1997\u20131998, Flaherty starred in the television adaptation of ''Police Academy'' (''[[Police Academy: The Series]]'') as Cmdt. Stuart Hefilfinger. The series lasted for only one season.\n\nIn 1999, Flaherty joined the cast of ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', an [[NBC]] hour-long [[dramedy]] set in the 1980\u20131981 academic year, in which he played Harold Weir, the irascible father of two teens. Despite a dedicated cult following, the show only lasted one season. In the third episode, \"Tricks and Treats\", he dons a cheap vampire costume reminiscent of his \"Count Floyd\" character of the depicted era.\n\nHe made appearances on the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]'' as Father McAndrew, priest at the Heffernans' church. He currently stars on the [[Bite TV]] original program called ''Uncle Joe's Cartoon Playhouse'', and serves as a judge on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] program ''Second City's: Next Comedy Legend''.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004, he had appeared in various [[Disney]] shows and films including ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'' and ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary|author=Hischak, Thomas S.|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2011|page=74|isbn=978-0-7864-6271-1}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 2004, Flaherty was a member of the faculty at [[Humber College]], where he taught a comedy-writing course.

He is best known for his work on the Canadian [[sketch comedy]] ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' from 1976 to 1984 (on which he also served as a writer), and as Harold Weir on ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]''.\n\n==Life and career==\nJoseph O'Flaherty<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/51/Joe-Flaherty.html Joe Flaherty Biography (1941-)]</ref> was born in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], the son of production clerk at Westinghouse Electric. His mother was of Italian descent and his father was of Irish heritage.<ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/the-worrier-in-the-comic-mask/article1001345/</ref>\n\nHe moved to [[Chicago]], where he started his comedy career with the [[The Second City|Second City]] Theater as Joe O'Flaherty. Along with several other Second City performers, he began appearing on the ''[[National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' from 1973 to 1974. After seven years in Chicago, he moved to [[Toronto]] to help establish the Toronto Second City theatre troupe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secondcity.com/people/other/joe-flaherty/|title=The Second City \u2013 Joe Flaherty|website=The Second City|accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref> During those years, he was one of the original writer/performers on ''SCTV'', where he spent eight years on the show, playing such characters as Big Jim McBob (of ''Farm Film Report'' fame), [[Count Floyd]]/[[Floyd Robertson]], and station owner/manager [[Guy Caballero]] who goes around in a [[wheelchair]] only for respect.\n\nOther memorable Flaherty characterizations included emotional talk show host Sammy Maudlin, seedy saxophonist-private eye Vic Arpeggio, aggressive elocution lecturer Norman Gorman, myopic public television host Hugh Betcha, and \"crazy as a snake\" ex-convict Rocco.\n\n''SCTV'' ceased production in 1984. The same year, Flaherty played Count Floyd in a short-film that was shown at concerts by the rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] before the song \"The Weapon\", for their tour in support of ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'' (and can be seen in the home video, ''[[Grace Under Pressure Tour (video)|Grace Under Pressure Tour]]'').\n\nFlaherty has appeared in a number of cult favorite films, for example, playing the part of the [[Western Union]] postal worker who delivers [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown's]] 70-year-old letter to [[Marty McFly]] in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989), as well as the crazed fan yelling \"jackass!\" in ''[[Happy Gilmore]]''. In [[Family Guy (season 8)|season eight]] of ''[[Family Guy]]'', Flaherty once again played the Western Union man in \"[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]\". He likewise satirizes his ''Back to the Future Part II'' character in \"[[The Big Bang Theory (Family Guy)|The Big Bang Theory]]\", this time playing a Vatican worker whose role is essentially identical to that of his Western Union character.\n\nIn 1989, Flaherty played a guest role in ''[[Married... with Children]]'' in season-four episode \"Tooth or Consequences\", as a recently divorced dentist who must repair Al Bundy's teeth.\n\nDuring 1997\u20131998, Flaherty starred in the television adaptation of ''Police Academy'' (''[[Police Academy: The Series]]'') as Cmdt. Stuart Hefilfinger. The series lasted for only one season.\n\nIn 1999, Flaherty joined the cast of ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', an [[NBC]] hour-long [[dramedy]] set in the 1980\u20131981 academic year, in which he played Harold Weir, the irascible father of two teens. Despite a dedicated cult following, the show only lasted one season. In the third episode, \"Tricks and Treats\", he dons a cheap vampire costume reminiscent of his \"Count Floyd\" character of the depicted era.\n\nHe made appearances on the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]'' as Father McAndrew, priest at the Heffernans' church. He currently stars on the [[Bite TV]] original program called ''Uncle Joe's Cartoon Playhouse'', and serves as a judge on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] program ''Second City's: Next Comedy Legend''.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004, he had appeared in various [[Disney]] shows and films including ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'' and ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary|author=Hischak, Thomas S.|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2011|page=74|isbn=978-0-7864-6271-1}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 2004, Flaherty was a member of the faculty at [[Humber College]], where he taught a comedy-writing course. He was also on the program's advisory committee.\n\n==Discography==\n*''[[Gold Turkey]]'' ([[National Lampoon Radio Hour|National Lampoon]] album, 1975)\n*''Count Floyd'' (1982) (RCA)\n\n==Filmography==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|1976-1984\n|''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''\n|Various\n|Canadian sketch comedy|-\n|-\n|1979\n|''[[1941 (film)|1941]]''\n|Sal Stewart/Raoul Lipschitz\n|Movie\n|-\n|1980\n|''[[Nothing Personal (1980 film)|Nothing Personal]]''\n|Patrol Car Policeman #2 \n|Movie\n|-\n|1980\n|''[[Used Cars]]'' \n|Sam Slaton\n|Movie\n|-\n|1981\n|''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]''\n|Border Guard\n|Movie \n|-\n|1981\n|''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]''  \n|Lawyer (segment \"Captain Sternn\"), General (segment \"So Beautiful and So Dangerous\")\n|Movie\n|-\n|1983 \n|''[[Going Berserk]]''\n|Chick Leff\n|Movie\n|-\n|1984\n|''[[Johnny Dangerously]]''\n|Death Row inmate ''(uncredited)''\n|Movie\n|-\n|1985 \n|''[[Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird]]''\n|Sid Sleaze\n|Movie\n|-\n|1986\n|''[[One Crazy Summer]]''\n|General Raymond\n|Movie\n|-\n|1986\n|''[[Club Paradise]]'' \n|Pilot \n|Movie\n|-\n|1987\n|''[[Innerspace]]'' \n|Waiting Room Patient\n|Movie\n|-\n|-\n|1988\n|''[[Kid Safe: The Video]]''\n|[[Count Floyd]]\n|Educational direct-to-video \n|-\n|1989\n|''[[Speed Zone|Speed Zone (Cannonball Fever)]]''\n|Vic DeRubis\n|Movie\n|-\n|1989\n|''[[Who's Harry Crumb?]]''\n|Doorman\n|Movie \n|-\n|1989\n|''[[Back to the Future Part II]]''  \n|Western Union Man \n|Movie\n|-\n|1990 \n|''[[Maniac Mansion (TV Series)|Maniac Mansion]]'' \n|Dr. Fred Edison\n|Television series\n|-\n|1994 \n|''[[Stuart Saves His Family]]''  \n|Cousin Ray - Funeral \n|Movie\n|-\n|1995 \n|''[[A Pig's Tale]]''  \n|Milt\n|Movie\n|-\n|1996\n|''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' \n|Donald the Jeering Fan\n|Movie\n|-\n|1996\n|''[[Snowboard Academy]]''\n|Mr. Barry\n|Movie \n|-\n|1997 \n|''[[The Wrong Guy]]''  \n|Fred Holden\n|Movie\n|-\n|1999\n|''[[Detroit Rock City (film)|Detroit Rock City]]'' \n|Father McNulty\n|Movie\n|-\n|1999-2000\n|''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' \n|Harold Weir\n|Television Series\n|-\n|2001\n|''[[That '70s Show]]''\n|Bryan (Mountie)\n|Television Series\n|-\n|2002-04\n|''[[Teamo Supremo]]''\n|Cloaked Skull (voice)\n|4 episodes \n|-\n|2002\n|''[[Clone High]]''\n|Abe's Foster Dad (voice)\n|Television Series\n|-\n|2002\n|''[[Slackers (film)|Slackers]]''  \n|Mr. Leonard \n|Movie\n|-\n|2003 \n|''[[National Security (2003 film)|National Security]]''\n|Owen Fergus \n|Movie\n|-\n|2004\n|''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]''\n|Himself\n|Only appears in deleted scene in the DVD edition.\n|-\n|2004\n|''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]'' \n|Jeb the Goat\n|Movie\n|-\n|}\n\n==Characterizations==\nCelebrities impersonated by Flaherty on SCTV include: [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[William F.
