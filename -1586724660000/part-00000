He stipulated that any agreement would have to allow for the [[Temple Mount]] to remain in Israeli hands.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==== Shmita controversy ====\nIn the sabbatical year of 2000, Bakshi-Doron became involved in a disagreement with some of the leading rabbis in Israel. In order to get around the ''[[Halakha|halakhic]]'' (Jewish law) prohibitions of ''[[shmita]]'', in which farmland must lie fallow once every seven years, some [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Religious Zionism|Zionist]] rabbis had allowed the use of the ''[[Heter Mechira]]'' (land-sale contract), through the use of which farmers could symbolically sell their land to non-Jews for the sabbatical year, thereby permitting them to continue farming. The permits immediately came under fire by Haredi rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv]]. Bakshi-Doron and Lau, with the support of former ''Rishon LeZion'' [[Ovadia Yosef]], ruled that the permits were valid. When Bakshi-Doron publicly told the farmers that they could rely on the sales, the Haredi newspaper [[Yated Ne'eman (Israel)|''Yated Ne'eman'']] began to leak word that Eliashiv would delegitimize him and put him and his family in ''[[Herem (censure)|herem]]'' (excommunication) if he refused to back down. Distraught, Bakshi-Doron went to meet with [[President of Israel|Israeli President]] [[Moshe Katsav]], reportedly bursting into tears. Despite the open support of Katsav and [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Ehud Barak]], Bakshi-Doron ultimately succumbed to the pressure from Eliashiv. This was widely seen by the [[National Religious Party|National Religious]] camp as surrender to the Haredim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/14433/edition_id/280/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Biblical farming law creates modern controversy|author=admin|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==== Reaching out ====\nOn January 21, 2002, Bakshi-Doron received attention when he took part in an [[Interfaith dialogue|interfaith]] conference in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]].

The theory of '''selection principles'''\nstudies these principles and their relations to other mathematical properties.\nSelection principles mainly describe covering properties, \nmeasure- and category-theoretic properties, and local properties in \ntopological spaces, especially function spaces. Often, the \ncharacterization of a mathematical property using a selection \nprinciple is a nontrivial task leading to new insights on the \ncharacterized property.\n\n==The main selection principles==\nIn 1924, [[Karl Menger]]\n<ref name=\"Karl Menger\">{{cite book|last1=Menger|first1=Karl|\ntitle=Einige \u00dcberdeckungss\u00e4tze der punktmengenlehre|\njournal=Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie|date=1924|volume=133|\npages=421\u2013444|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-6110-4_14|isbn=978-3-7091-7282-7}}</ref> \nintroduced the following basis property for metric spaces: \nEvery basis of the topology contains a sequence of sets with vanishing \ndiameters that covers the space.

Selection properties that are not covering properties are often studied by using implications to and from selective covering properties of related spaces.\n\nLet <math>X</math> be a [[topological space]].  An ''open cover'' of <math>X</math> is a family of open sets whose union is the entire space <math>X.</math>  For technical reasons, we also request that the entire space <math>X</math> is not a member of the cover.  The class of open covers of the space <math>X</math> is denoted by  <math>\\mathbf{O}</math>. (Formally, <math>\\mathbf{O}(X)</math>, but usually the space <math>X</math> is fixed in the background.) The above-mentioned property of Menger is, thus, <math>\\text{S}_{\\text{fin}}(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{O})</math>. In 1942, Fritz Rothberger considered Borel's strong measure zero sets, and introduced a topological variation later called [[Rothberger space]] (also known as ''C<math>''</math> space''). In the notation of selections, Rothberger's property is the property <math>\\text{S}_{1}(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{O})</math>.\n\nAn open cover <math>\\mathcal{U}</math> of <math>X</math> is '''point-cofinite''' if it has infinitely many elements, and every point  <math>x\\in X</math> belongs to all but finitely many sets <math>U\\in\\mathcal{U}</math>. (This type of cover was considered by Gerlits and Nagy, in the third item of a certain list in their paper. The list was enumerated by Greek letters, and thus these covers are often called '''<math>\\gamma</math>-covers'''.) The class of point-cofinite open covers of <math>X</math> is denoted by <math>\\mathbf{\\Gamma}</math>. A topological space is a [[Hurewicz space]] if it satisfies  <math>\\text{U}_{\\text{fin}}(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{\\Gamma})</math>.\n\nAn open cover <math>\\mathcal{U}</math> of <math>X</math> is an '''<math>\\omega</math>-cover''' if every finite subset of <math>X</math> is contained in some member of <math>\\mathcal{U}</math>. The class of <math>\\omega</math>-covers of <math>X</math> is denoted by <math>\\mathbf{\\Omega}</math>. A topological space is a [[\u03b3-space]] if it satisfies  <math>\\binom{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}{\\mathbf{\\Gamma}}</math>.\n\nBy using star selection hypotheses one obtains properties such as '''star-Menger''' (<math>\\text{S}_{\\text{fin}}^*(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{O})</math>), '''star-Rothberger''' (<math>\\text{S}_1^*(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{O})</math>) and '''star-Hurewicz''' (<math>\\text{S}_{\\text{fin}}^*(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{\\Gamma})</math>).\n\n===The Scheepers Diagram===\nThere are 36 selection properties of the form <math> \\Pi(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B})</math>, for <math>\\Pi\\in\\{\\text{S}_1, \\text{S}_\\text{fin},\\text{U}_\\text{fin}, \\bigl(~~\\bigr)\\}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B}\\in\\{\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{\\Gamma},\\mathbf{\\Omega}\\}</math>.

Selection properties that are not covering properties are often studied by using implications to and from selective covering properties of related spaces.\n\nLet <math>X</math> be a [[topological space]].  An ''open cover'' of <math>X</math> is a family of open sets whose union is the entire space <math>X.</math>  For technical reasons, we also request that the entire space <math>X</math> is not a member of the cover.  The class of open covers of the space <math>X</math> is denoted by  <math>\\mathbf{O}</math>. (Formally, <math>\\mathbf{O}(X)</math>, but usually the space <math>X</math> is fixed in the background.) The above-mentioned property of Menger is, thus, <math>\\text{S}_{\\text{fin}}(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{O})</math>. In 1942, Fritz Rothberger considered Borel's strong measure zero sets, and introduced a topological variation later called [[Rothberger space]] (also known as ''C<math>''</math> space''). In the notation of selections, Rothberger's property is the property <math>\\text{S}_{1}(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{O})</math>.\n\nAn open cover <math>\\mathcal{U}</math> of <math>X</math> is '''point-cofinite''' if it has infinitely many elements, and every point  <math>x\\in X</math> belongs to all but finitely many sets <math>U\\in\\mathcal{U}</math>. (This type of cover was considered by Gerlits and Nagy, in the third item of a certain list in their paper. The list was enumerated by Greek letters, and thus these covers are often called '''<math>\\gamma</math>-covers'''.) The class of point-cofinite open covers of <math>X</math> is denoted by <math>\\mathbf{\\Gamma}</math>. A topological space is a [[Hurewicz space]] if it satisfies  <math>\\text{U}_{\\text{fin}}(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{\\Gamma})</math>.\n\nAn open cover <math>\\mathcal{U}</math> of <math>X</math> is an '''<math>\\omega</math>-cover''' if every finite subset of <math>X</math> is contained in some member of <math>\\mathcal{U}</math>. The class of <math>\\omega</math>-covers of <math>X</math> is denoted by <math>\\mathbf{\\Omega}</math>. A topological space is a [[\u03b3-space]] if it satisfies  <math>\\binom{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}{\\mathbf{\\Gamma}}</math>.\n\nBy using star selection hypotheses one obtains properties such as '''star-Menger''' (<math>\\text{S}_{\\text{fin}}^*(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{O})</math>), '''star-Rothberger''' (<math>\\text{S}_1^*(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{O})</math>) and '''star-Hurewicz''' (<math>\\text{S}_{\\text{fin}}^*(\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{\\Gamma})</math>).\n\n===The Scheepers Diagram===\nThere are 36 selection properties of the form <math> \\Pi(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B})</math>, for <math>\\Pi\\in\\{\\text{S}_1, \\text{S}_\\text{fin},\\text{U}_\\text{fin}, \\bigl(~~\\bigr)\\}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B}\\in\\{\\mathbf{O},\\mathbf{\\Gamma},\\mathbf{\\Omega}\\}</math>.

Jupiter then recalled the prophecy that his own child would overthrow him as he had [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], and in turn, Saturn had [[Caelus]].\n\nFearing that their child would be male, and would grow stronger than he was and rule the Heavens in his place, Jupiter swallowed Metis whole after tricking her into turning herself into a fly. The titaness gave birth to Minerva and forged weapons and armor for her child while within Jupiter's body. In some versions of the story, Metis continued to live inside of Jupiter's mind as the source of his wisdom. Others say she was simply a vessel for the birth of Minerva. The constant pounding and ringing left Jupiter with agonizing pain. To relieve the pain, [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] used a hammer to split Jupiter's head and, from the cleft, Minerva emerged, whole, adult, and in full battle armor.\n\n== Presence in Mythology ==\nMinerva is a prominent figure in Roman Mythology. She appears throughout many famous myths. Many of the stories of her Greek counterpart [[Athena]] are attributed to Minerva in Roman mythology, such as that of the naming of Athens<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Apollodorus|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Apollodorus_Library_and_Hyginus_Fabulae.html?id=wx2wngEACAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Apollodorus' Library and Hyginus' Fabulae: Two Handbooks of Greek Mythology|last2=Hyginus|date=2007|publisher=Hackett Pub.|isbn=978-0-87220-820-9|language=en}}</ref> resulting from a competition between Minerva and [[Neptune (mythology)]],<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Ovid, 43 B.C.-17 A.D. or 18 A.D., author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1007036859|title=Metamorphoses|isbn=978-0-253-03359-8|oclc=1007036859}}</ref> in which Minerva created the olive tree.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Bulfinch, Thomas.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1028955021|title=The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes.|date=2010|publisher=Neeland Media LLC|isbn=978-1-59625-257-8|oclc=1028955021}}</ref>\n\n=== Minerva and Arachne ===\nArachne was a mortal highly proficient in weaving and embroidery. Not only were her finished works that were beautiful, but also her process, so much so that nymphs would come out of their natrual environments to watch her work. Arachne boasted that her skills could beat those of Minerva, and if she were wrong she would pay the price for it. This angered Minerva, and she took the form of an old woman to approach Arachne, offering her a chance to take back her challenge and ask forgiveness<ref name=\":2\" />. When Arachne refused, Minerva rid herself of her disguise and took Arachne up on her challenge. Arcachne began to weave a tapestry which showed the shortcomings of the gods, while Minerva depicted her competiton with Neptune and the gods looking down with disgust on mortals who would dare to challenge them<ref name=\":2\" />. Minerva's weaving was meant as a final warning to her foe to back down. Minerva was insulted by the scenes which Arachne was weaving, and destroyed it. She then touched Arachne on the forehead which made her feel shame for what she had done, leading her to hang herself. Minerva then felt bad for the woman, and brought her back to life. However, Minerva transformed her into a spider as punishment for her actions, and hanging from a web would forever be a reminder to Arachne of her actions which offended the gods. This story also acted as a warning to mortals not to challenge the gods.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Minerva and Medusa ===\n[[Medusa]] was once a beautiful human, her beauty rivaled that of Minerva. Because of this Minerva turned her into a monster, replacing her hair with hissing snakes and removing her charm. Medusa turned any living creature she looked upon into stone.

Minerva caught the horse and tamed it before gifting the horse to the [[Muses]]. It was a kick from the hoof of Pegasus which opened the fountain [[Hippocrene]].<ref name=\":2\" /> When [[Bellerophon]] later went to fight the [[Chimera (mythology)]] he sought to use Pegasus in the fight.

The titaness gave birth to Minerva and forged weapons and armor for her child while within Jupiter's body. In some versions of the story, Metis continued to live inside of Jupiter's mind as the source of his wisdom. Others say she was simply a vessel for the birth of Minerva. The constant pounding and ringing left Jupiter with agonizing pain. To relieve the pain, [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] used a hammer to split Jupiter's head and, from the cleft, Minerva emerged, whole, adult, and in full battle armor.\n\n== Presence in Mythology ==\nMinerva is a prominent figure in Roman Mythology.

This angered Minerva, and she took the form of an old woman to approach Arachne, offering her a chance to take back her challenge and ask forgiveness<ref name=\":2\" />. When Arachne refused, Minerva rid herself of her disguise and took Arachne up on her challenge. Arcachne began to weave a tapestry which showed the shortcomings of the gods, while Minerva depicted her competiton with Neptune and the gods looking down with disgust on mortals who would dare to challenge them<ref name=\":2\" />. Minerva's weaving was meant as a final warning to her foe to back down. Minerva was insulted by the scenes which Arachne was weaving, and destroyed it. She then touched Arachne on the forehead which made her feel shame for what she had done, leading her to hang herself. Minerva then felt bad for the woman, and brought her back to life.

The word ''mens'' is built from the [[PIE|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*men-'' 'mind' (linked with memory as in Greek [[Mnemosyne]]/\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7 and ''mnestis''/\u03bc\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2: memory, remembrance, recollection, ''manush'' in Sanskrit meaning mind).\n\nThe Etruscan Menrva was part of a holy [[triad (relationship)|triad]] with [[Tinia]] and [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]], equivalent to the Roman [[Capitoline Triad]] of Jupiter-Juno-Minerva.\n\n==Modern depictions and references of Minerva==\n===Universities and educational establishments===\n{{main|Minerva in the emblems of educational establishments}}\nAs a patron goddess of wisdom, Minerva frequently features in statuary, as an image on seals, and in other forms at educational institutions.
