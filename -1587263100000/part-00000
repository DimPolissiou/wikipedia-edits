Considered a relatively secondary part of the naval warfare of World War I, it nonetheless tied down significant forces.\n\nThe Adriatic campaign was also important because for the first time two new weapons were used successfully in warfare, viz. the [[MAS (boat)|MAS]] [[torpedo boat]] of [[Luigi Rizzo]] that sank the battleship {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n||2}} and the [[human torpedo]] of [[Raffaele Rossetti]] that sank the battleship {{SMS|Viribus Unitis||6}} in 1918.\n\n==History==\n===1914===\n====Beginning of the war====\n[[File:Austro-Hungarian Dreadnoughts At Pula.jpg|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian dreadnoughts at [[Pula|Pola]].]]\n[[File:Jean Bart (1911).jpg|right|thumb|The French [[battleship]] {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1911|2}}.]]\n\nOn 6 August 1914 an [[wikt:Anglo-French|Anglo-French]] naval agreement was signed, giving [[France]] leadership of naval operations in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. The remaining [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean forces]] - one [[armoured cruiser]], four [[light cruiser]]s, and 16 [[destroyer]]s - were placed under the control of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|French Mediterranean Fleet]], and bases at both [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]] were opened to the French.\n\nOne day after the French declaration of war against [[Austria-Hungary]] on 11 August, a French fleet under Admiral [[Augustin Bou\u00e9 de Lapeyr\u00e8re]] arrived at Malta. He had orders to sail with all available French and British ships, pass into the Adriatic Sea, and undertake whatever operations he thought best against Austrian ports. Lapeyr\u00e8re decided to surprise Austrian vessels enforcing a blockade of [[Montenegro]]. The main Allied force comprised the French battleships {{ship|French battleship|Courbet|1911|2}} and {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1911|2}}, and the cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re||2}}. Two French squadrons of [[Pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]]s, two squadrons of cruisers, and five destroyer squadrons were held back in support. The British support group comprised two armoured cruisers and three destroyer divisions. The Anglo-French force succeeded in cutting off and sinking the old Austro-Hungarian light cruiser {{SMS|Zenta||6}} off [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] on 16 August in the [[Battle of Antivari]].\n\nThroughout most of late August most of the action was simple bombardment of [[Serbia]]n and Montenegrin troops by Austrian ships. On 9 August, the pre-dreadnought {{SMS|Monarch||6}} shelled the French radio station at [[Budva]], while the destroyer {{SMS|Panther|1885|6}} shelled [[Mount Lov\u0107en]]. On 17 August, ''Monarch'' shelled a Montenegrin radio station off Bar, then another station off [[Volovica Point]] on 19 August. Meanwhile, a French squadron shelled Austrian troops on [[Prevlaka]].\n\nThe French and Montenegrin forces attempted to cause havoc also at Cattaro in September, October and November 1914, and the KuK navy was called in there also, resulting in a decisive defeat for the Allies.\n\nBoth the French and the Austrians spent much of this time laying extensive [[minefield]]s throughout the shallow waters of the Adriatic. Mostly this was done by destroyers, and at night. Several steamships ran afoul of these mines and either sunk or were damaged.\n\n====The ''Goeben''====\n{{main|Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau}}\n\nIn July, the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben||6}} sailed to [[Triest]] from [[Pula|Pola]]. She and the German cruiser {{SMS|Breslau||6}} had been anchored there since the beginning of the summer. On 1 August, ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'' rendezvoused at [[Brindisi]], then headed for [[Messina]] to take on coal. They left for [[Constantinople]] on 6 August, shadowed by the British cruiser {{HMS|Gloucester|1909|6}}.\n\nOn 7 August, an Austro-Hungarian Fleet\u2014consisting of six battleships, two cruisers, and 19 destroyers and torpedo boats\u2014sortied from Pola to escort ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'' through Austro-Hungarian territorial waters, returned to port following day without ever making contact. ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'' briefly engaged HMS ''Gloucester'' and the chase was abandoned by the British. By 10 August, both German warships were safely in the [[Dardanelles]] and heading for [[Turkey]].\n\n====Winter====\nIn November, the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Cugnot||2}} managed to slip into the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] as far as [[Topla Bay]] but was chased out by the Austrian destroyer {{SMS|Blitz}}, and the torpedo boat ''Tb 57T''. Later that month, the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Curie|Q87|2}} raided the harbour barrage of Pola to wait for her chance to intrude. Two days later, on 20 December, during an attempt to sneak into the harbour she got entangled in an [[anti-submarine net]] and could not free herself. Forced to surface for fresh air, she was sunk by the Austrian destroyer {{SMS|Magnet||6}} and ''Tb 63T'', with three casualties. The Austrians raised the wreck between December 1914 and February 1915. It was then repaired and commissioned as {{SMU|U-14|Austria-Hungary|2}} in June 1915.\n\nOn 21 December, the submarine {{SMU|U-12|Austria-Hungary|2}} scored one torpedo hit on the French battleship ''Jean Bart'' off [[Sazan]] Island. The battleship had to withdraw to Malta for extensive repairs.\n\n===1915===\nIn February, the French destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Dague||2}}\u2014while escorting the transport ''Whitehead'' to Bar\u2014was sunk after hitting a mine. Also that month, the Austrian submarine ''U-12'' was unsuccessfully attacked off [[Cape Mendra]] by a French submarine. Austrian destroyer {{SMS|Csik\u00f3s}} shelled Montenegrin positions at Bar with ''Tb 15'' and ''Tb 68F''.\n\nIn April, the Austrian {{SMU|U-5|Austria-Hungary|2}}\u2014commanded by Lt. [[Georg Ritter von Trapp]]\u2014chased the French armoured cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Victor Hugo||2}} off [[Paxos (island)|Paxos]], but was unable to fire any torpedoes. ''U-5'' also torpedoed the French armoured cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|L\u00e9on Gambetta||2}} after a two-day chase off [[Santa Maria di Leuca]], causing 684 fatalities including Rear-Admiral S\u00e9n\u00e8s. Only 137 French sailors survived. The Austrian {{SMU|U-4|Austria-Hungary|2}} torpedoed and damaged the British light cruiser {{HMS|Dublin|1912|6}}. Also, the Austrian destroyer {{SMS|Warasdiner||6}} shelled enemy positions at Bar.\n\n====Bombardment of Ancona====\n{{Main|Bombardment of Ancona}}\n[[File:Ancona mappa.png|right|thumb|Italian province of [[Ancona]].]]\n\nWhen [[Italy]] declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May, the Austrian fleet was quick to act, launching several attacks on the [[Marche]] region of Italy.<ref name=\"Dario Petkovi\u0107 2004\">{{Cite book|first=Dario|last=Petkovi\u0107|title=Ratna mornarica austro-ugarske monarhije|location= |publisher=Pula|year=2004|isbn=953-6250-80-2}}</ref> That day, the destroyer ''Dinara'' and ''Tb 53T'' bombarded the port of [[Ancona]]. The destroyer {{SMS|Lika}}\u2014on reconnaissance duty between [[Palagru\u017ea]] and [[Cape Gargano]]\u2014shelled the [[semaphore line|semaphore]] and [[radio station]] at [[Vieste]] and fired upon the Italian destroyer {{ship|Italian destroyer|Turbine|1901|2}}. On 24 May, the bulk of the Austrian fleet at Pola sailed for the Italian Adriatic coast. This included the dreadnoughts ''Viribus Unitis'', {{SMS|Tegetthoff|1912|2}}, {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}} and eight semi and pre-dreadnoughts. The fleet bombarded several cities and other targets in and around the [[Province of Ancona]], especially damaging the port and town of Ancona itself.\n[[File:Gun turret on SMS Tegetthoff.JPG|thumb|left|[[Gun turret]] on {{SMS|Tegetthoff|1912|6}}.]]\n\nThe destroyer {{SMS|Velebit}} shelled the Italian airship ''Citt\u00e0 di Ferrara'' off Ancona. The semi-dreadnought {{SMS|Radetzky||6}} and two torpedo boats bombarded [[Potenza Picena]], then returned to Pola. The ''Radetzky''-class semi-dreadnought {{SMS|Zr\u00ednyi}}, with two torpedo boats bombarded [[Senigallia]], destroying a train and damaging a railway station and a bridge, then returned to Pola. The torpedo boat ''Tb 3'' was unsuccessfully bombed by an Italian airship. The light cruiser {{SMS|Admiral Spaun}} shelled the Italian signal station at [[Tremiti Islands|Cretaccio Island]], while the armoured cruiser {{SMS|Sankt Georg||6}}\u2014with two torpedo boats\u2014shelled [[Rimini]], damaging and derailing a freight train. The destroyer {{SMS|Streiter}} shelled the signal station near [[Torre di Mileto]]. The light cruiser {{SMS|Novara|1913|6}}, a destroyer and two torpedo boats entered [[Corsini Channel]] and shelled an Italian torpedo boat station, a semaphore station, and coastal artillery batteries.\n\nThe light cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|6}}\u2014aided by four destroyers\u2014sank the Italian destroyer ''Turbine'' in a pitched battle south of [[Pelagosa]]. The destroyer {{SMS|T\u00e1tra}} shelled the railway embankment near [[Manfredonia]] while the destroyer {{SMS|Csepel}} shelled the Manfredonia railway station.\n\nFinally, Austro-Hungarian [[flying boat]]s dropped bombs on [[Venice]] and [[airship hangar]]s at [[Chiaravalle (AN)|Chiaravalle]].\n\n====Allied raids====\nIn response, on 5 June, four different Allied task forces attacked the Austrian coast. Four Italian armoured cruisers, escorted by four French destroyers, shelled [[Cavtat]]; the British cruiser ''Dublin''\u2014escorted by five Italian destroyers\u2014shelled [[Donzella]]; the Italian light cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Quarto||2}}\u2014escorted by four destroyers\u2014bombarded [[Lastovo]]; the Italian light cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Nino Bixio||2}}, two Italian and two French destroyers shelled the island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]]. On 9 June, a mixed force of British, French and Italian destroyers shelled the Austro-Hungarian signal station at [[Cape Rondini]] in [[Albania]].\n\n====The summer of 1915====\n''Sankt Georg'' and a squadron of torpedo boats bombarded Rimini on 16 June, causing minor damage. Then on 17 June, the cruisers ''Novara'' and ''Admiral Spaun'' and their escorts attacked and sank the Italian steamer ''Maria Grazia'' off [[Giulianova]]. The next day, they shelled Rimini and [[Fano]], destroying the Italian signal station there.\n\nThe summer of 1915 was a successful time for Austrian submarines as well: on 10 June, {{SMU|U-11|Austria-Hungary|2}} sank the Italian submarine {{ship|Italian submarine|Medusa|1911|2}} and torpedo boat {{ship|Italian torpedo boat|Serpente||2}}; {{SMU|U-10|Austria-Hungary|2}} sank the Italian torpedo boat ''PN 5'' on June 26 off Venice; ''U-4'' torpedoed and sank the {{ship|Italian cruiser|Giuseppe Garibaldi|1899|2}} on 18 July; and ''U-5'' captured the Greek steamer ''Cefalonia'' off Durazzo on August 29. But this was not without losses. On 13 August, {{SMU|U-3|Austria-Hungary|2}} was sunk at Brindisi by the French destroyer [[Bisson-class destroyer|''Bisson'']]<!-- {{ship|French destroyer|Bisson||2}}-->, after having been severely damaged by the Italian auxiliary cruiser {{ship|Italian auxiliary cruiser|Citt\u00e0 di Catania||2}} the day before.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian naval air-arm also began regular bombing raids against [[Bari]] and Brindisi in June, slightly damaging the British protected cruiser {{HMS|Amethyst|1903|6}} in one such raid with machine gun fire. And the British [[Naval trawler|armed trawler]] ''Schiehallion'' was sunk by a mine. The {{ship|Italian cruiser|Amalfi||2}} was sunk off Venice by the German submarine {{SMU|UB-14||2}} on July 2. While the Italian scout cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Marsala||2}} shelled [[Gravosa]] station on 18 July, the scout cruiser ''Quarto'' and three Italian destroyers attacked the Austrian installation at [[Guiparra]].\n\nSMS ''Helgoland'', seven destroyers and four torpedo boats supported an Austrian landing at Pelagosa on 28 July. The landing was repulsed by the Italian garrison, that had arrived in the island on July 11. On August 17 the light cruisers \"Helgoland\", \"Saida\" and several destroyers bombarded the island again. The water reservoir was severely damaged and the next day the Italians began the evacuation. On 17 August, one of the cruisers was unsuccessfully torpedoed by an Italian submarine on return journey. The last act of the summer was the sinking on 26 September of the Italian battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Benedetto Brin||2}} in Brindisi harbour by Italian-speaking Austro-Hungarian [[saboteur]]s. Over 450 were killed.\n\nIn late September, the Allies established the [[Otranto Barrage]], an attempt to blockade the entrance to the Adriatic Sea at the [[Strait of Otranto]].\n\n====December====\n[[File:Monge-Marius Bar-img 3154.jpg|thumb|The French submarine ''Monge'']]\n\nIn early December, the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Fresnel||2}} ran aground off the [[Bojana River]] estuary due to bad navigation, and was sunk by the Austrian destroyer ''Warasdiner''. The cruiser ''Helgoland'' and three destroyers sortie against the Otranto Barrage from 5\u201322 December and performed reconnaissance off the Albanian coast and [[San Giovanni di Medua]]. They sank an Italian picket boat, three steamships loaded with ammunition and two armed schooners ''en route'' to Northern Albania.\n\nThe light cruiser SMS ''Helgoland'' and five Tatra-class destroyers left Cattaro and headed for Durazzo late on 28 December 1915. While on passage the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Monge|1910|2}} was rammed by the cruiser SMS ''Helgoland'', and finally sunk by gunfire from the destroyer {{SMS|Balaton}}. Early the next day, the Austrians squadron opened fire on Durazzo targets, sinking some small ships. Then they ran into a minefield. The destroyer ''Lika'' was sunk and ''Triglav'' was damaged. She was taken in tow and the Austrian force sailed slowly to north.\n\nAn allied force had already sailed from Brindisi, with the aim to intercept them. It was composed of the British light cruisers HMS ''Dartmouth'' and ''Weymouth'', the Italian light cruisers RN ''Quarto'' and ''Nino Bixio'' and five French destroyers. In support of the retreating force, the Austrians despatched the armoured cruiser SMS ''Kaiser Karl VI'' and the light cruiser ''Novara'' from Cattaro. Early in the afternoon of 29 December, the forward Allied ships came into action with the retreating Austrian light squadron, which was still only halfway home. The ''Triglav'' was abandoned and scuttled and a long-range gunnery duel was fought throughout the afternoon. SMS ''Tatra'' was damaged but the Austrian light force was able to reach Cattaro safely.\n\n===1916===\nAustrian submarines sank or damaged a number of ships in 1916. ''U-11'' captured the Italian hospital ship ''King Albert'' on 18 January at San Giovanni di Medua. {{SMU|U-6|Austria-Hungary|2}} sank the French destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Renaudin||2}} on 16 March at [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]]. On 8 June, ''U-5'' torpedoed and sank the Italian troop transport ''Principe Umberto'' at [[Linguetta]]. Later, ''U-5'' fought a French-Italian destroyer group to a stalemate on 2 August, and torpedoed the Italian Q-Ship ''Pantelleria'' south of [[Taranto]] on August 14.\n\nOn 15 September 1916, the two Austro-Hungarian seaplanes L.132 and L.135 forced the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Foucault||2}} to surface by dropping bombs. L.135 finally sinks the sub while the 27 survivors were clinging to the two planes now floating, to be finally saved by the alarmed ''Tb 100M''. This was the first sinking of a submarine by airplanes in naval war history.\n\nThe very same day, the French submarine ''Amp\u00e9re'' scored two torpedo hits on the Austro-Hungarian Hospital ship ''No I'' (the former Lloyd steamer ''Elektra'') off [[Cape Planka]] (Rat Ploca), causing two fatalities. The damaged hospital ship had to be beached in Borovica Bay for further repairs.\n\nOn the night of 22/23 December, the Austro-Hungarian destroyers {{SMS|Scharfschuetze||6}}, {{SMS|Reka||2}}, {{SMS|Dinara||2}} and ''Velebit'' attacked the [[Naval drifter|drifter]]s patrolling the Otranto barrage, which applied for help to the French destroyers {{ship|French destroyer|Casque|1910|2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Protet||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Commandant Rivi\u00e8re||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Commandant Bory||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Dehorter||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Boutefeu||2}} which were escorting a convoy from Brindisi to Taranto. Because of communication problems, only ''Casque'' and ''Commandant Rivi\u00e8re'' attacked, but ''Casque''{{'}}s boiler rooms were hit immediately and she had to slow down to {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. For further assistance, the Italian destroyers {{ship|Italian destroyer|Giuseppe Cesare Abba||2}}, {{ship|Italian destroyer|Ippolito Nievo||2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Rosolino Pilo||2}} left Brindisi shortly followed by the British cruiser ''Gloucester'' escorted by {{ship|Italian destroyer|Impavido|1913|2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Irriquieto||2}}. The French and Italian groups met during darkness, ''Giuseppe Cesare Abba'' rammed ''Casque''; some moments later, ''Boutefeu'' rammed ''Giuseppe Cesare Abba''. While the damaged vessels had to be taken into tow, the Austrians escaped in the darkness.\n\nThe return from the Otranto battle\u201415 May 1917\u2014brought the British cruiser {{HMS|Dartmouth|1910|6}} within the range of the {{SMU|UC-25||2}} which had already laid mines off Brindisi.\n\nAt 13:30, ''UC-25'' torpedoed ''Dartmouth'' approximately {{convert|36|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} off Brindisi, for some time the ship was considered to be lost, but was manned by a rescue crew later and finally towed into port. On hearing that ''Dartmouth'' had been torpedoed, ''Boutefeu'' went to assist, only to hit one of ''UC-25''{{'}}s mines.\n\n===1917===\nBy August 1917, Lt. Von Trapp and ''U-14'' had sunk more than {{convert|24000|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} of enemy shipping, including the Italian steamer ''Milazzo'' ({{convert|11480|LT|t|abbr=on}}). ''U-4'' torpedoed the French steamer ''Italia'' near Taranto on 30 May, and on 16 November {{SMU|U-43|Austria-Hungary|2}} severely damaged the Italian steamer ''Oriona'' between Brindisi and [[Vlor\u00eb|Valona]]. On the night of 9\u201310 December, while SMS ''Wien'' and ''Budapest'' were at anchor in Trieste, two Italian MAS (motor torpedo boats) managed to penetrate the harbour defences undetected and fired several torpedoes at the two ships. ''Wien'' was struck by two torpedoes and sank in less than five minutes with the loss of 46 of her crew.\n\n===1918===\nOn 13 February, the submarine {{ship|French submarine|Bernouilli|Q83|2}} (Audry) was lost with all hands after hitting a mine off the Bocche di Cattaro.\n\nOn 22/23 April, the Austro-Hungarian {{sclass-|T\u00e1tra|destroyer|2}}s {{SMS|Triglav}}, {{SMS|Uzsok}}, {{SMS|Dukla}}, SMS ''Lika'' and SMS ''Csepel'' encountered the British destroyers {{HMS|Jackal|1911|6}} and {{HMS|Hornet|1911|2}}, the Australian {{HMAS|Torrens|D67|6}} and the French {{ship|French destroyer|Cimeterre||2}}. HMS ''Hornet'' was badly damaged in the ensuing fight but the alarm went up and the Austrians turned for home, pursued by ''Jackal'', who had lost her mainmast.\n\n====The Premuda attack====\n[[File:Affondamento Santo Stefano.jpg|thumb|right|The last moments of SMS ''Szent Istv\u00e1n'', hit by a torpedo of the Italian MAS of [[Luigi Rizzo]]]]\nAt 03:30 on the morning of 10 June 1918, the battleship ''Szent Istv\u00e1n''\u2014in the company of SMS ''Tegetthoff'' and seven other ships ''en route'' to attack the Otranto Barrage \u2014 was seen by chance and then hit by two torpedoes launched from the Italian [[MAS (ships)|MAS]]-15 [[Motor Torpedo Boat]] under Corvette Captain Luigi Rizzo near [[Premuda]] island, near [[Zadar|Zara]]. Many of the 1,087 crew were asleep, getting rested for the battle expected in a few hours. Immediate chaos soon changed into frantic efforts to save the vessel which was rapidly shipping water. SMS ''Tegetthoff'' was hit by another torpedo from a second MAS, but it did not explode.\n\nThen ''Tegetthoff''\u2014which had at first sped away from the vicinity of the torpedo attack\u2014returned and took ''Szent Istv\u00e1n'' in tow, in an attempt to reach the massive dry dock at Pula. However, the pumps were unequal to the task before them due to loss of steam pressure and the ship continued to slowly list, sinking at 06:12, almost 3 hours after being hit.<ref name=\"Dario Petkovi\u0107 2004\"/>\n\nIt is debated that faults in the {{sclass-|Tegetthoff|battleship|0}} design - relatively low [[Displacement (fluid)|displacement]] and high [[centre of gravity]], together with the weight of twelve {{convert|305|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} main artillery - did not assist matters. However, most other battleships in The Great War which were either torpedoed or mined sank far more rapidly. There were, however, only 89 dead, partly attributed to the fact that all sailors with the K.u.K. had to learn to swim before entering active service. The attack on the Otranto Barrage was cancelled as a consequence of this attack.<ref name=\"Dario Petkovi\u0107 2004\"/>\n\nOn 20 September, the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Circ\u00e9|Q47|2}} was torpedoed {{convert|7|nmi|abbr=on}} north west of Cape Rodoni by the Austro-Hungarian submarine {{SMU|U-47|Austria-Hungary|2}} and lost with all hands.\n\n====Second Battle of Durazzo====\nOn 2 October, an allied fleet composed of Italian, British, Australian and American warships attacked the port of Durazzo, which had by that time come under Austro-Hungarian occupation, during the [[Battle of Durazzo (1918)|Second Battle of Durazzo]]. The fleet consisted of over 55 vessels along with MAS boats and supporting aircraft. Allied forces destroyed Austro-Hungarian shore batteries and defeated a small squadron of patrol craft while sustaining comparatively light damage. Durazzo was left in flames, several building, bridges and railroad targets were bombarded which forced the evacuation of the city. A week or so after the battle an allied army occupied the city without resistance.\n\n====Sinking of ''Viribus Unitis''====\nOn 1 November, the ex-Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] [[flagship]] ''Viribus Unitis'' was sunk \u2014 along with the merchant-ship ''Wien''\u2014 both at anchor at Pula by  [[limpet mine]] attached by the crew of an Italian ''mignatta'' (human torpedo). The ''mignatta'' was the precursor of the human torpedo and was invented by Major of naval engineers Raffaele Rossetti.\n\nThe whole Austrian Navy was at the time being transferred to the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], but the Italian attackers had not been informed.\n\n==Austro-Hungarian submarines results==\n{{Main|Mediterranean U-boat Campaign (World War I)}}\n\nMany Austro-Hungarian and German U-boats operated out of the Adriatic for the whole of the war. Due to lack of cooperation of the Allies in the Mediterranean control zones, and the late institution of the convoy system, U-boats experienced substantial success throughout the first war years.<ref name=\"WILL\">{{Cite book|title=First World War|last=Willmott|first=H.

Considered a relatively secondary part of the naval warfare of World War I, it nonetheless tied down significant forces.\n\nThe Adriatic campaign was also important because for the first time two new weapons were used successfully in warfare, viz. the [[MAS (boat)|MAS]] [[torpedo boat]] of [[Luigi Rizzo]] that sank the battleship {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n||2}} and the [[human torpedo]] of [[Raffaele Rossetti]] that sank the battleship {{SMS|Viribus Unitis||6}} in 1918.\n\n==History==\n\n===1914===\n\n====Beginning of the war====\n[[File:Austro-Hungarian Dreadnoughts At Pula.jpg|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian dreadnoughts at [[Pula|Pola]].]]\n[[File:Jean Bart (1911).jpg|right|thumb|The French [[battleship]] {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1911|2}}.]]\n\nOn 6 August 1914 an [[wikt:Anglo-French|Anglo-French]] naval agreement was signed, giving [[France]] leadership of naval operations in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. The remaining [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean forces]] - one [[armoured cruiser]], four [[light cruiser]]s, and 16 [[destroyer]]s - were placed under the control of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|French Mediterranean Fleet]], and bases at both [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]] were opened to the French.\n\nOne day after the French declaration of war against [[Austria-Hungary]] on 11 August, a French fleet under Admiral [[Augustin Bou\u00e9 de Lapeyr\u00e8re]] arrived at Malta. He had orders to sail with all available French and British ships, pass into the Adriatic Sea, and undertake whatever operations he thought best against Austrian ports. Lapeyr\u00e8re decided to surprise Austrian vessels enforcing a blockade of [[Montenegro]]. The main Allied force comprised the French battleships {{ship|French battleship|Courbet|1911|2}} and {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1911|2}}, and the cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re||2}}. Two French squadrons of [[Pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]]s, two squadrons of cruisers, and five destroyer squadrons were held back in support. The British support group comprised two armoured cruisers and three destroyer divisions. The Anglo-French force succeeded in cutting off and sinking the old Austro-Hungarian light cruiser {{SMS|Zenta||6}} off [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] on 16 August in the [[Battle of Antivari]].\n\nThroughout most of late August most of the action was simple bombardment of [[Serbia]]n and Montenegrin troops by Austrian ships. On 9 August, the pre-dreadnought {{SMS|Monarch||6}} shelled the French radio station at [[Budva]], while the destroyer {{SMS|Panther|1885|6}} shelled [[Mount Lov\u0107en]]. On 17 August, ''Monarch'' shelled a Montenegrin radio station off Bar, then another station off [[Volovica Point]] on 19 August. Meanwhile, a French squadron shelled Austrian troops on [[Prevlaka]].\n\nThe French and Montenegrin forces attempted to cause havoc also at Cattaro in September, October and November 1914, and the KuK navy was called in there also, resulting in a decisive defeat for the Allies.\n\nBoth the French and the Austrians spent much of this time laying extensive [[minefield]]s throughout the shallow waters of the Adriatic. Mostly this was done by destroyers, and at night. Several steamships ran afoul of these mines and either sunk or were damaged.\n\n====The ''Goeben''====\n{{main|Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau}}\n\nIn July, the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben||6}} sailed to [[Triest]] from [[Pula|Pola]]. She and the German cruiser {{SMS|Breslau||6}} had been anchored there since the beginning of the summer. On 1 August, ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'' rendezvoused at [[Brindisi]], then headed for [[Messina]] to take on coal. They left for [[Constantinople]] on 6 August, shadowed by the British cruiser {{HMS|Gloucester|1909|6}}.\n\nOn 7 August, an Austro-Hungarian Fleet\u2014consisting of six battleships, two cruisers, and 19 destroyers and torpedo boats\u2014sortied from Pola to escort ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'' through Austro-Hungarian territorial waters, returned to port following day without ever making contact. ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'' briefly engaged HMS ''Gloucester'' and the chase was abandoned by the British. By 10 August, both German warships were safely in the [[Dardanelles]] and heading for [[Turkey]].\n\n====Winter====\nIn November, the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Cugnot||2}} managed to slip into the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] as far as [[Topla Bay]] but was chased out by the Austrian destroyer {{SMS|Blitz}}, and the torpedo boat ''Tb 57T''. Later that month, the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Curie|Q87|2}} raided the harbour barrage of Pola to wait for her chance to intrude. Two days later, on 20 December, during an attempt to sneak into the harbour she got entangled in an [[anti-submarine net]] and could not free herself. Forced to surface for fresh air, she was sunk by the Austrian destroyer {{SMS|Magnet||6}} and ''Tb 63T'', with three casualties. The Austrians raised the wreck between December 1914 and February 1915. It was then repaired and commissioned as {{SMU|U-14|Austria-Hungary|2}} in June 1915.\n\nOn 21 December, the submarine {{SMU|U-12|Austria-Hungary|2}} scored one torpedo hit on the French battleship ''Jean Bart'' off [[Sazan]] Island. The battleship had to withdraw to Malta for extensive repairs.\n\n===1915===\nIn February, the French destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Dague||2}}\u2014while escorting the transport ''Whitehead'' to Bar\u2014was sunk after hitting a mine. Also that month, the Austrian submarine ''U-12'' was unsuccessfully attacked off [[Cape Mendra]] by a French submarine. Austrian destroyer {{SMS|Csik\u00f3s}} shelled Montenegrin positions at Bar with ''Tb 15'' and ''Tb 68F''.\n\nIn April, the Austrian {{SMU|U-5|Austria-Hungary|2}}\u2014commanded by Lt. [[Georg Ritter von Trapp]]\u2014chased the French armoured cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Victor Hugo||2}} off [[Paxos (island)|Paxos]], but was unable to fire any torpedoes. ''U-5'' also torpedoed the French armoured cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|L\u00e9on Gambetta||2}} after a two-day chase off [[Santa Maria di Leuca]], causing 684 fatalities including Rear-Admiral S\u00e9n\u00e8s. Only 137 French sailors survived. The Austrian {{SMU|U-4|Austria-Hungary|2}} torpedoed and damaged the British light cruiser {{HMS|Dublin|1912|6}}. Also, the Austrian destroyer {{SMS|Warasdiner||6}} shelled enemy positions at Bar.\n\n====Bombardment of Ancona====\n{{Main|Bombardment of Ancona}}\n[[File:Ancona mappa.png|right|thumb|Italian province of [[Ancona]].]]\n\nWhen [[Italy]] declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May, the Austrian fleet was quick to act, launching several attacks on the [[Marche]] region of Italy.<ref name=\"Dario Petkovi\u0107 2004\">{{Cite book|first=Dario|last=Petkovi\u0107|title=Ratna mornarica austro-ugarske monarhije|location= |publisher=Pula|year=2004|isbn=953-6250-80-2}}</ref> That day, the destroyer ''Dinara'' and ''Tb 53T'' bombarded the port of [[Ancona]]. The destroyer {{SMS|Lika}}\u2014on reconnaissance duty between [[Palagru\u017ea]] and [[Cape Gargano]]\u2014shelled the [[semaphore line|semaphore]] and [[radio station]] at [[Vieste]] and fired upon the Italian destroyer {{ship|Italian destroyer|Turbine|1901|2}}. On 24 May, the bulk of the Austrian fleet at Pola sailed for the Italian Adriatic coast. This included the dreadnoughts ''Viribus Unitis'', {{SMS|Tegetthoff|1912|2}}, {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}} and eight semi and pre-dreadnoughts. The fleet bombarded several cities and other targets in and around the [[Province of Ancona]], especially damaging the port and town of Ancona itself.\n[[File:Gun turret on SMS Tegetthoff.JPG|thumb|left|[[Gun turret]] on {{SMS|Tegetthoff|1912|6}}.]]\n\nThe destroyer {{SMS|Velebit}} shelled the Italian airship ''Citt\u00e0 di Ferrara'' off Ancona. The semi-dreadnought {{SMS|Radetzky||6}} and two torpedo boats bombarded [[Potenza Picena]], then returned to Pola. The ''Radetzky''-class semi-dreadnought {{SMS|Zr\u00ednyi}}, with two torpedo boats bombarded [[Senigallia]], destroying a train and damaging a railway station and a bridge, then returned to Pola. The torpedo boat ''Tb 3'' was unsuccessfully bombed by an Italian airship. The light cruiser {{SMS|Admiral Spaun}} shelled the Italian signal station at [[Tremiti Islands|Cretaccio Island]], while the armoured cruiser {{SMS|Sankt Georg||6}}\u2014with two torpedo boats\u2014shelled [[Rimini]], damaging and derailing a freight train. The destroyer {{SMS|Streiter}} shelled the signal station near [[Torre di Mileto]]. The light cruiser {{SMS|Novara|1913|6}}, a destroyer and two torpedo boats entered [[Corsini Channel]] and shelled an Italian torpedo boat station, a semaphore station, and coastal artillery batteries.\n\nThe light cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|6}}\u2014aided by four destroyers\u2014sank the Italian destroyer ''Turbine'' in a pitched battle south of [[Pelagosa]]. The destroyer {{SMS|T\u00e1tra}} shelled the railway embankment near [[Manfredonia]] while the destroyer {{SMS|Csepel}} shelled the Manfredonia railway station.\n\nFinally, Austro-Hungarian [[flying boat]]s dropped bombs on [[Venice]] and [[airship hangar]]s at [[Chiaravalle (AN)|Chiaravalle]].\n\n====Allied raids====\nIn response, on 5 June, four different Allied task forces attacked the Austrian coast. Four Italian armoured cruisers, escorted by four French destroyers, shelled [[Cavtat]]; the British cruiser ''Dublin''\u2014escorted by five Italian destroyers\u2014shelled [[Donzella]]; the Italian light cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Quarto||2}}\u2014escorted by four destroyers\u2014bombarded [[Lastovo]]; the Italian light cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Nino Bixio||2}}, two Italian and two French destroyers shelled the island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]]. On 9 June, a mixed force of British, French and Italian destroyers shelled the Austro-Hungarian signal station at [[Cape Rondini]] in [[Albania]].\n\n====The summer of 1915====\n''Sankt Georg'' and a squadron of torpedo boats bombarded Rimini on 16 June, causing minor damage. Then on 17 June, the cruisers ''Novara'' and ''Admiral Spaun'' and their escorts attacked and sank the Italian steamer ''Maria Grazia'' off [[Giulianova]]. The next day, they shelled Rimini and [[Fano]], destroying the Italian signal station there.\n\nThe summer of 1915 was a successful time for Austrian submarines as well: on 10 June, {{SMU|U-11|Austria-Hungary|2}} sank the Italian submarine {{ship|Italian submarine|Medusa|1911|2}} and torpedo boat {{ship|Italian torpedo boat|Serpente||2}}; {{SMU|U-10|Austria-Hungary|2}} sank the Italian torpedo boat ''PN 5'' on June 26 off Venice; ''U-4'' torpedoed and sank the {{ship|Italian cruiser|Giuseppe Garibaldi|1899|2}} on 18 July; and ''U-5'' captured the Greek steamer ''Cefalonia'' off Durazzo on August 29. But this was not without losses. On 13 August, {{SMU|U-3|Austria-Hungary|2}} was sunk at Brindisi by the French destroyer [[Bisson-class destroyer|''Bisson'']]<!-- {{ship|French destroyer|Bisson||2}}-->, after having been severely damaged by the Italian auxiliary cruiser {{ship|Italian auxiliary cruiser|Citt\u00e0 di Catania||2}} the day before.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian naval air-arm also began regular bombing raids against [[Bari]] and Brindisi in June, slightly damaging the British protected cruiser {{HMS|Amethyst|1903|6}} in one such raid with machine gun fire. And the British [[Naval trawler|armed trawler]] ''Schiehallion'' was sunk by a mine. The {{ship|Italian cruiser|Amalfi||2}} was sunk off Venice by the German submarine {{SMU|UB-14||2}} on July 2. While the Italian scout cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Marsala||2}} shelled [[Gravosa]] station on 18 July, the scout cruiser ''Quarto'' and three Italian destroyers attacked the Austrian installation at [[Guiparra]].\n\nSMS ''Helgoland'', seven destroyers and four torpedo boats supported an Austrian landing at Pelagosa on 28 July. The landing was repulsed by the Italian garrison, that had arrived in the island on July 11. On August 17 the light cruisers \"Helgoland\", \"Saida\" and several destroyers bombarded the island again. The water reservoir was severely damaged and the next day the Italians began the evacuation. On 17 August, one of the cruisers was unsuccessfully torpedoed by an Italian submarine on return journey. The last act of the summer was the sinking on 26 September of the Italian battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Benedetto Brin||2}} in Brindisi harbour by Italian-speaking Austro-Hungarian [[saboteur]]s. Over 450 were killed.\n\nIn late September, the Allies established the [[Otranto Barrage]], an attempt to blockade the entrance to the Adriatic Sea at the [[Strait of Otranto]].\n\n====December====\n[[File:Monge-Marius Bar-img 3154.jpg|thumb|The French submarine ''Monge'']]\n\nIn early December, the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Fresnel||2}} ran aground off the [[Bojana River]] estuary due to bad navigation, and was sunk by the Austrian destroyer ''Warasdiner''. The cruiser ''Helgoland'' and three destroyers sortie against the Otranto Barrage from 5\u201322 December and performed reconnaissance off the Albanian coast and [[San Giovanni di Medua]]. They sank an Italian picket boat, three steamships loaded with ammunition and two armed schooners ''en route'' to Northern Albania.\n\nThe light cruiser SMS ''Helgoland'' and five Tatra-class destroyers left Cattaro and headed for Durazzo late on 28 December 1915. While on passage the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Monge|1910|2}} was rammed by the cruiser SMS ''Helgoland'', and finally sunk by gunfire from the destroyer {{SMS|Balaton}}. Early the next day, the Austrians squadron opened fire on Durazzo targets, sinking some small ships. Then they ran into a minefield. The destroyer ''Lika'' was sunk and ''Triglav'' was damaged. She was taken in tow and the Austrian force sailed slowly to north.\n\nAn allied force had already sailed from Brindisi, with the aim to intercept them. It was composed of the British light cruisers HMS ''Dartmouth'' and ''Weymouth'', the Italian light cruisers RN ''Quarto'' and ''Nino Bixio'' and five French destroyers. In support of the retreating force, the Austrians despatched the armoured cruiser SMS ''Kaiser Karl VI'' and the light cruiser ''Novara'' from Cattaro. Early in the afternoon of 29 December, the forward Allied ships came into action with the retreating Austrian light squadron, which was still only halfway home. The ''Triglav'' was abandoned and scuttled and a long-range gunnery duel was fought throughout the afternoon. SMS ''Tatra'' was damaged but the Austrian light force was able to reach Cattaro safely.\n\n===1916===\nAustrian submarines sank or damaged a number of ships in 1916. ''U-11'' captured the Italian hospital ship ''King Albert'' on 18 January at San Giovanni di Medua. {{SMU|U-6|Austria-Hungary|2}} sank the French destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Renaudin||2}} on 16 March at [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]]. On 8 June, ''U-5'' torpedoed and sank the Italian troop transport ''Principe Umberto'' at [[Linguetta]]. Later, ''U-5'' fought a French-Italian destroyer group to a stalemate on 2 August, and torpedoed the Italian Q-Ship ''Pantelleria'' south of [[Taranto]] on August 14.\n\nOn 15 September 1916, the two Austro-Hungarian seaplanes L.132 and L.135 forced the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Foucault||2}} to surface by dropping bombs. L.135 finally sinks the sub while the 27 survivors were clinging to the two planes now floating, to be finally saved by the alarmed ''Tb 100M''. This was the first sinking of a submarine by airplanes in naval war history.\n\nThe very same day, the French submarine ''Amp\u00e9re'' scored two torpedo hits on the Austro-Hungarian Hospital ship ''No I'' (the former Lloyd steamer ''Elektra'') off [[Cape Planka]] (Rat Ploca), causing two fatalities. The damaged hospital ship had to be beached in Borovica Bay for further repairs.\n\nOn the night of 22/23 December, the Austro-Hungarian destroyers {{SMS|Scharfschuetze||6}}, {{SMS|Reka||2}}, {{SMS|Dinara||2}} and ''Velebit'' attacked the [[Naval drifter|drifter]]s patrolling the Otranto barrage, which applied for help to the French destroyers {{ship|French destroyer|Casque|1910|2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Protet||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Commandant Rivi\u00e8re||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Commandant Bory||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Dehorter||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Boutefeu||2}} which were escorting a convoy from Brindisi to Taranto. Because of communication problems, only ''Casque'' and ''Commandant Rivi\u00e8re'' attacked, but ''Casque''{{'}}s boiler rooms were hit immediately and she had to slow down to {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. For further assistance, the Italian destroyers {{ship|Italian destroyer|Giuseppe Cesare Abba||2}}, {{ship|Italian destroyer|Ippolito Nievo||2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Rosolino Pilo||2}} left Brindisi shortly followed by the British cruiser ''Gloucester'' escorted by {{ship|Italian destroyer|Impavido|1913|2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Irriquieto||2}}. The French and Italian groups met during darkness, ''Giuseppe Cesare Abba'' rammed ''Casque''; some moments later, ''Boutefeu'' rammed ''Giuseppe Cesare Abba''. While the damaged vessels had to be taken into tow, the Austrians escaped in the darkness.\n\nThe return from the Otranto battle\u201415 May 1917\u2014brought the British cruiser {{HMS|Dartmouth|1910|6}} within the range of the {{SMU|UC-25||2}} which had already laid mines off Brindisi.\n\nAt 13:30, ''UC-25'' torpedoed ''Dartmouth'' approximately {{convert|36|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} off Brindisi, for some time the ship was considered to be lost, but was manned by a rescue crew later and finally towed into port. On hearing that ''Dartmouth'' had been torpedoed, ''Boutefeu'' went to assist, only to hit one of ''UC-25''{{'}}s mines.\n\n===1917===\nBy August 1917, Lt. Von Trapp and ''U-14'' had sunk more than {{convert|24000|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} of enemy shipping, including the Italian steamer ''Milazzo'' ({{convert|11480|LT|t|abbr=on}}). ''U-4'' torpedoed the French steamer ''Italia'' near Taranto on 30 May, and on 16 November {{SMU|U-43|Austria-Hungary|2}} severely damaged the Italian steamer ''Oriona'' between Brindisi and [[Vlor\u00eb|Valona]]. On the night of 9\u201310 December, while SMS ''Wien'' and ''Budapest'' were at anchor in Trieste, two Italian MAS (motor torpedo boats) managed to penetrate the harbour defences undetected and fired several torpedoes at the two ships. ''Wien'' was struck by two torpedoes and sank in less than five minutes with the loss of 46 of her crew.\n\n===1918===\nOn 13 February, the submarine {{ship|French submarine|Bernouilli|Q83|2}} (Audry) was lost with all hands after hitting a mine off the Bocche di Cattaro.\n\nOn 22/23 April, the Austro-Hungarian {{sclass-|T\u00e1tra|destroyer|2}}s {{SMS|Triglav}}, {{SMS|Uzsok}}, {{SMS|Dukla}}, SMS ''Lika'' and SMS ''Csepel'' encountered the British destroyers {{HMS|Jackal|1911|6}} and {{HMS|Hornet|1911|2}}, the Australian {{HMAS|Torrens|D67|6}} and the French {{ship|French destroyer|Cimeterre||2}}. HMS ''Hornet'' was badly damaged in the ensuing fight but the alarm went up and the Austrians turned for home, pursued by ''Jackal'', who had lost her mainmast.\n\n====The Premuda attack====\n[[File:Affondamento Santo Stefano.jpg|thumb|right|The last moments of SMS ''Szent Istv\u00e1n'', hit by a torpedo of the Italian MAS of [[Luigi Rizzo]]]]\n\nAt 03:30 on the morning of 10 June 1918, the battleship ''Szent Istv\u00e1n''\u2014in the company of SMS ''Tegetthoff'' and seven other ships ''en route'' to attack the Otranto Barrage \u2014 was seen by chance and then hit by two torpedoes launched from the Italian [[MAS (ships)|MAS]]-15 [[Motor Torpedo Boat]] under Corvette Captain Luigi Rizzo near [[Premuda]] island, near [[Zadar|Zara]]. Many of the 1,087 crew were asleep, getting rested for the battle expected in a few hours. Immediate chaos soon changed into frantic efforts to save the vessel which was rapidly shipping water. SMS ''Tegetthoff'' was hit by another torpedo from a second MAS, but it did not explode.\n\nThen ''Tegetthoff''\u2014which had at first sped away from the vicinity of the torpedo attack\u2014returned and took ''Szent Istv\u00e1n'' in tow, in an attempt to reach the massive dry dock at Pula. However, the pumps were unequal to the task before them due to loss of steam pressure and the ship continued to slowly list, sinking at 06:12, almost 3 hours after being hit.<ref name=\"Dario Petkovi\u0107 2004\"/>\n\nIt is debated that faults in the {{sclass-|Tegetthoff|battleship|0}} design - relatively low [[Displacement (fluid)|displacement]] and high [[centre of gravity]], together with the weight of twelve {{convert|305|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} main artillery - did not assist matters. However, most other battleships in The Great War which were either torpedoed or mined sank far more rapidly. There were, however, only 89 dead, partly attributed to the fact that all sailors with the K.u.K. had to learn to swim before entering active service. The attack on the Otranto Barrage was cancelled as a consequence of this attack.<ref name=\"Dario Petkovi\u0107 2004\"/>\n\nOn 20 September, the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Circ\u00e9|Q47|2}} was torpedoed {{convert|7|nmi|abbr=on}} north west of Cape Rodoni by the Austro-Hungarian submarine {{SMU|U-47|Austria-Hungary|2}} and lost with all hands.\n\n====Second Battle of Durazzo====\nOn 2 October, an allied fleet composed of Italian, British, Australian and American warships attacked the port of Durazzo, which had by that time come under Austro-Hungarian occupation, during the [[Battle of Durazzo (1918)|Second Battle of Durazzo]]. The fleet consisted of over 55 vessels along with MAS boats and supporting aircraft. Allied forces destroyed Austro-Hungarian shore batteries and defeated a small squadron of patrol craft while sustaining comparatively light damage. Durazzo was left in flames, several building, bridges and railroad targets were bombarded which forced the evacuation of the city. A week or so after the battle an allied army occupied the city without resistance.\n\n====Sinking of ''Viribus Unitis''====\nOn 1 November, the ex-Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] [[flagship]] ''Viribus Unitis'' was sunk \u2014 along with the merchant-ship ''Wien''\u2014 both at anchor at Pula by  [[limpet mine]] attached by the crew of an Italian ''mignatta'' (human torpedo). The ''mignatta'' was the precursor of the human torpedo and was invented by Major of naval engineers Raffaele Rossetti.\n\nThe whole Austrian Navy was at the time being transferred to the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], but the Italian attackers had not been informed.\n\n==Austro-Hungarian submarines results==\n{{Main|Mediterranean U-boat Campaign (World War I)}}\n\nMany Austro-Hungarian and German U-boats operated out of the Adriatic for the whole of the war. Due to lack of cooperation of the Allies in the Mediterranean control zones, and the late institution of the convoy system, U-boats experienced substantial success throughout the first war years.<ref name=\"WILL\">{{Cite book|title=First World War|last=Willmott|first=H.

However, unlike normal schools, this one is run entirely by the Student Council and possesses a frightening hierarchy determined by gambling. There, the best gamblers enjoy popularity, money, connections and authority, while those in debt are deemed as Pets and servants to the entire student body, recognisable with a chain and tag around their neck. Yumeko Jabami, a beautiful but mysterious second-year transfer student, arrives at Hyakkaou Academy and is introduced to the school by Ryota Suzui, a male student who has been classified as a bottom-ranked Pet after having lost a gamble to Mary Saotome, their class's best gambler, and hence accumulating a large debt. As Ryota warns Yumeko of the gambling system and discourages her from gambling, Mary challenges Yumeko to a [[Rock paper scissors|modified rock-paper-scissors]] game: (''[[Jankenpon]]''). Although Yumeko loses all her chips, she requests a final bet worth 10 million yen in cash, and reveals how Mary had manipulated the classmates' votes to allow her to determine Yumeko's cards. Yumeko mocks Mary for giving away her methods and then wins the game, placing Mary into debt. Afterwards, Ryota apologises to Yumeko for his role in helping Mary cheat, but Yumeko gifts him some of her winnings as thanks for adding to the thrill of the game and considers him her friend.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 2\n| Title               = A Boring Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Tsumannai Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u3064\u307e\u3093\u306a\u3044\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Takashi Kobayashi\n| WrittenBy           = Yasuko Kobayashi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|7|8}}\n| ShortSummary        = Follow her loss, Mary becomes a Pet. Yumeko, whose name has been spread all over the school for having beat Mary on her first day after her transfer, is challenged to a Double Concentration game by Itsuki Sumeragi, the daughter of the CEO of Japan's top toy company and a first-year member of the Student Council, famed for having never lost at a card game before. For this gamble, Itsuki uses two decks of cards \"Radcliffe\" made by her father's company and wins 20 million yen from Yumeko in a close match. Despite Yumeko not having enough money and Itsuki having won already, Itsuki decides to accept a second round under the condition that if Yumeko loses she can have her fingernails and toenails removed to add to her already extensive nail collection. Once again, Itsuki deals from the same two decks, confident that her cheating style of using heat-activated patterns in the cards will help her win again. However, Yumeko reveals to have picked up on her scheme since the first game and used her intellect to memorise the cards and match them to their corresponding matching card, winning the game on her first turn and remarking that Itsuki would have won had she used cards with different markings.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 3\n| Title               = Slit-Eyed Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Itome no Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u7cf8\u76ee\u306e\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = [[Shigeru Ueda]]\n| WrittenBy           = Yasuko Kobayashi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|7|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = Yumeko is invited to the Traditional Culture Research Society's clubroom just in time to witness Mary lose a high-stakes bet and adding 40 million yen to her debt.

After the first game ends in a draw, Yumeko goes all in, deducing that Yuriko has been cheating by having the dealer wear magnets on her hand to affect the movement of the swords. Just as Yuriko becomes panicked over the thought of potentially losing over 2 billion yen, several Student Council members, including the Student Council President Kirari Momobami, step in suddenly to observe the game. When the swords are unveiled, it reveals Yuriko's win, which Yumeko suspects may have been the result of an elaborate cheating method the Student Council used specifically for their game, by heading directly to the room underneath and using magnets to prevent her from winning. Ending up 310 million yen in debt as a result of her loss, Yumeko ends up being classed as a Pet too.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 4\n| Title               = The Woman Who Became Livestock\n| TranslitTitle       = Kachiku ni Natta Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u5bb6\u755c\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Kazuki \u014chashi\n| WrittenBy           = Hiroshi Seko\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|7|22}}\n| ShortSummary        = In lieu of payment requests, both Yumeko and Mary receive \"Life Schedules\" from the Student Council, which rigorously dictate their entire futures including which career they will have, who they will eventually marry and even how many children they will have if they do not clear their debts. With the increasing numbers of Pets, the Student Council announces a Debt Exchange Game, in which groups of four students play a game of two-card [[Indian poker]] to try and exchange their debts, with the winner losing their debt completely and even standing a chance to win money. Yumeko and Mary end up in the same group with Jun Kiwatari, a delinquent male student infamous for his cruel treatment of Pets and another Pet named Nanami Tsubomi. Despite Jun not having any debts, he enters a relatively small 10 million yen debt to use the game to make a profit.

Finally, Jun manages to move up to first but becomes panicked again when it looks like Nanami will overtake him and tries to coerce her into folding. After some provocation by Yumeko, however, Nanami rebels against Jun's orders. At the end of the match, Mary ends up in first place while Jun ends up in last, as it is revealed that Yumeko and Mary had switched the debts they keyed in to the game with each other, making Yumeko's of least value instead. As a result, Jun ends up with Yumeko's 310 million debt, Yumeko obtains Jun's fake 10 million debt and Mary's debt is cleared, while Nanami is left with the same debt she started with, but with a new sense of freedom and self-esteem.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 6\n| Title               = Tempting Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Sasou Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u8a98\u3046\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Takashi Kobayashi\n| WrittenBy           = Yasuko Kobayashi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|8|12}}{{efn|Only on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] episodes 6 and 7 aired on August 19 and August 20, 2017 due to the broadcast of the [[2017 World Championships in Athletics|World Championship in Athletics]].

Midari Ikishima, a Student Council member and the chairwoman of the Beautification Committee, decides to challenge Yumeko to a guessing game to tell which card order played by the dealer, and the winner of each round gets to point one of two revolvers at the loser and pull the trigger with neither knowing which of the guns' 6 chambers contain a bullet. Despite the possibility of losing her life, Yumeko agrees but only under the conditions that the game only last 3 rounds, Ryota must be the dealer, and the loser must pay 1 billion yen. To feel and enjoy the pain, Midari also adds another rule that should the winner miss her shot on purpose the loser can fire a shot in return. Once the game begins, Ryota gives Yumeko meaningless signs to make Midari falsely believe Yumeko knew which cards he played and would win, but Midari fully loads her gun with 6 bullets anyway, winding up scoring higher. Yumeko warns Midari that pulling the trigger is a bad idea but Midari ignores her.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 7\n| Title               = Refusing Women\n| TranslitTitle       = Kyozetsu-suru Onna-tachi\n| NativeTitle         = \u62d2\u7d76\u3059\u308b\u5973\u305f\u3061\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = K\u014dichir\u014d Kuroda\n| WrittenBy           = Yasuko Kobayashi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|8|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = Seconds before Midari fires, Yumeko claims it as her gun and how she sabotaged it to backfire, but Midari doesn't hesitate to shoot, revealing how Midari doesn't fear getting hurt or killed. This information is all Yumeko wanted, though; it was a bluff and the gun is unloaded. When questioned about her reasons, Midari reveals she blinded her left eye as payment for losing against the President and now only gambles when the risk is pain or death. In the second round Yumeko correctly matches every card as Ryota simply uses Yumeko's card order from round one. She chooses a revolver and fires, having chosen the revolver that weighed less due to being unloaded. In the final round, Midari puts Ryota under pressure by reversing the screen and giving him ten seconds to deal the cards; he deals them in the same order again. Having figured out the cheating by mirroring the cameras (Ryota is right handed but was somehow dealing with his left) from the beginning as Midari predicted, both of them load two bullets. As Midari wants to be shot, she aims to get no matches, knowing that with a full match Yumeko has to pull the trigger five times, guaranteeing at least one shot, but Yumeko ruins her plan by getting no matches, too, resulting in a draw. Yumeko finds playing with no risk boring and despises Midari for it. Midari, realizing she has been totally defeated, begs Yumeko to shoot her just once, but Yumeko refuses. Meanwhile, Mary refuses to join the council and swears revenge on Kirari. At the end of the game, to let her experience the thrill she had failed to have in the game with Midari, Yumeko challenges Ryota to [[Coin flipping|heads or tails]] and buys him sweets when she loses.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 8\n| Title               = Love-Dancing Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Aiodoru Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u611b\u8e0a\u308b\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Yasunori Got\u014d\n| WrittenBy           = Shigeru Murakoshi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|8|26}}\n| ShortSummary        = Kirari departs from the academy, leaving the rest of the Council unsure how to deal with Yumeko and letting the second-years Kaede Manyuda and Yumemi Yumemite take advantage of the situation to increase their authority.

As the head of PR and a YourTube Japanese idol, Yumemi bets Yumeko 50 million yen on the outcome of an on-stage idol championship competition where should Yumeko lose, Yumemi will alter her life schedule to force her into an idol duo with her, losing any hopes she has of a social life or meaningful relationships, much like Yumemi's own life. Yumeko tricks Yumemi into admitting her real thoughts that her fans are all disgusting pigs on a recording device and adds it to the bet.

For the final game they have to guess the birth month of members of the audience, and is crucial in that should Yumeko lose this game she loses the entire gamble. Yumemi, having memorised the birthdays of her entire fan club, is confident of her win, but panics when Yumeko manipulates dice and the audience member chosen is Mary. Yumeko tricks Yumemi into writing '9' on her card when she wrote '6', initially scaring her, but when Mary's birthday is revealed to be in March instead, Yumeko wins the game by her guess being 3 months closer, winning the entire game. The recording is played, but even so, Yumemi's fans still remain loyal to her. Yumeko, pleased at Yumemi's conviction, reveals that someone had attempted to sabotage Yumemi's career by sending her a ripped-up fan letter along with the challenge match prior. Yumemi then publicly accuses Kaede, who is the only plausible option for running the match with her. As Kaede denies any wrongdoing and announces his plans as the next President, Yumeko suggests they gamble to decide who is lying, declaring it an official match which he is not allowed to refuse.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 10\n| Title               = Selective Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Sentaku suru Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u9078\u629e\u3059\u308b\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Yasunori Got\u014d\n| WrittenBy           = Hiroshi Seko\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|9|9}}\n| ShortSummary        = Kirari attends a meeting with the heads of her extended family, all members of the Momobami clan. Back on stage, Kaede becomes convinced that Yumeko is simply a gambling addict who gambles for the thrill of it. The masked vice-president Ririka suggests a genre of modified [[Poker]] where no player is allowed to fold or call and the last player who raises can decide whether a [[List of poker hands|stronger or weaker hand]] wins, meaning each round will have a winner, and insists on being the dealer. Like regular Poker, each player may discard and replace any number of cards once before betting. Yumeko uses her 310 million to 31 poker chips while Kaede buys a 100 for 1 billion. Yumeko wins the first round causing Kaede to factor in her love of risk-taking and uses his keen calculations and intellect to win the subsequent rounds. Yumeko is given the option to continue playing ([[Glossary of poker terms#rebuy|rebuy]]) and calls out to Itsuki in the audience for money. Kaede insults her but offers her Council seat back, prompting Yumeko to defend Itsuki as her friend and urges her to take a risk for the sake of her ambitions, rather than accept her seat back from Kaede as the safe way.

Yumeko suggests Itsuki bet her life, i.e. to receive a Life Schedule, and although she refuses at first but after seeing Yumeko\u2019s cards she rips out her own fingernails and willingly bets her life. Based on Itsuki\u2019s family wealth Ririka declares her Life Schedule to be worth 10 billion, prompting to Kaede challenge the decision. Ririka then removes her mask, revealing she is actually Kirari in disguise and that the two are twins. With Yumeko\u2019s bet now totalling 12 billion Kaede desperately bets his own Life Schedule for 10 billion and chooses strong. However, Yumeko reveals Itsuki\u2019s desperation was a plot to deceive Kaede into choosing strong and reveals she has three jacks, beating Kaede\u2019s three eights. Kaede ends up billions in debt and loses his Council seat. Yumeko and Kirari sit down to discuss their reasons for gambling, with both of them appearing to have some sort of attraction to each other.

Sumeragi and Mary believe a card with a lipstick smudge is the Fool. Although Yumeko says she is the only one with the risk of expulsion, Ryota vows to share her fate to be with her. Ryota is tempted to pick the marked card, but changes his mind at the last second suspecting that it is a ploy by Kirari, and eventually chooses totally at random, the risk factor arousing Yumeko intensely. The chosen card is worth 20 points, thus equalling Kirari's score. The game ends with Runa declares the match a draw and no one having to be expelled, but Kirari and Yumeko agree to gamble again in the future. In a closing dialogue, Ryota sums up how Yumeko has affected everybody she gambled with.

The impatient Midari goes first, then Yumeko and then Midari cuts a string, but the guillotine fails to fall. Erimi explains that it is a torture machine of her family who use it to extract information.

Then Sayaka opens a trapdoor and descends one floor, but defying logic, Yumeko then opens a door in the external wall.\n| LineColor           = A6086F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 22\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 10\n| Title               = The Logical Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Ri no Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u7406\u306e\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Hidekazu Hara\n| WrittenBy           = Hiroshi Seko\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|3|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = Runa Yomozuki theorises that many of the distributed votes are being held as [[Proxy voting|proxies]] for some of the front runners.

However, on the ascent, Yumeko reaches the top first, She had correctly guessed that the outer part of the tower rotated after she opened an outer door, and then used the central staircase to travel down and back up. Having lost by using logic rather than intuition, Sayaka opens one of the outer doors and jumps from the tower. Surprisingly Kirari jumps as well, grabbing Sayaka as they fall. They both survive, landing on a soft safety mat instead of hard ground. Kirari licks the blood off of Sayaka's forehead, and they embrace. Although Sayaka lost the bet, Kirari asks Sayaka to be her secretary again, explaining that she needs Sayaka, and that, as strangers, they can begin a new relationship.\n| LineColor           = A6086F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 23\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 11\n| Title               = The Woman Who Bears the X\n| TranslitTitle       = Batsu o seou Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u00d7\u3092\u80cc\u8ca0\u3046\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Takeshi Sat\u014d\n| WrittenBy           = Shigeru Murakoshi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|3|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = Yumeko, Saotome and the other students receive invitations to a \"Hundred Votes Auction\".

Rei Batsubami is the auctioneer and Inaho Yamato is to be the Election Committee  monitor. The bidding for the first lot goes quickly, with Saotome winning on a bid of 80 votes, however the unseen sponsor collected 130 votes from the bids. The second round goes to Nishinotoin, again with a winning bid of 80 votes. After the third round, Saotome realizes that Rei Batsubami is also bidding, and she forces Rei to stop bidding.

Yumeko then has three billion yen brought into the room, and challenges the real Rei Batsubami to an all-or-nothing gamble, and Rei accepts, removing her glasses, wig and gloves to reveal her true self.\n| LineColor           = A6086F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 24\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 12\n| Title               = The Null Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Rei no Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u96f6\u306e\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Kiyoshi Matsuda\n| WrittenBy           = Yasuko Kobayashi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|3|26}}\n| ShortSummary        = Rei Batsubami retells when she was a servant treated like livestock by the Monobami clan and she received kindness from a lady visitor.

After she reveals that she is using hundreds of votes collected from non-competitive students betting on whether she would win the election, the game continues.

However, unlike normal schools, this one is run entirely by the Student Council and possesses a frightening hierarchy determined by gambling. There, the best gamblers enjoy popularity, money, connections and authority, while those in debt are deemed as Pets and servants to the entire student body, recognisable with a chain and tag around their neck. Yumeko Jabami, a beautiful but mysterious second-year transfer student, arrives at Hyakkaou Academy and is introduced to the school by Ryota Suzui, a male student who has been classified as a bottom-ranked Pet after having lost a gamble to Mary Saotome, their class's best gambler, and hence accumulating a large debt. As Ryota warns Yumeko of the gambling system and discourages her from gambling, Mary challenges Yumeko to a [[Rock_paper_scissors|modified rock-paper-scissors]] game: (''[[Jankenpon]]''). Although Yumeko loses all her chips, she requests a final bet worth 10 million yen in cash, and reveals how Mary had manipulated the classmates' votes to allow her to determine Yumeko's cards. Yumeko mocks Mary for giving away her methods and then wins the game, placing Mary into debt. Afterwards, Ryota apologises to Yumeko for his role in helping Mary cheat, but Yumeko gifts him some of her winnings as thanks for adding to the thrill of the game and considers him her friend.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 2\n| Title               = A Boring Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Tsumannai Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u3064\u307e\u3093\u306a\u3044\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Takashi Kobayashi\n| WrittenBy           = Yasuko Kobayashi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|7|8}}\n| ShortSummary        = Follow her loss, Mary becomes a Pet.

For this gamble, Itsuki uses two decks of cards \"Radcliffe\" made by her father's company and wins 20 million yen from Yumeko in a close match. Despite Yumeko not having enough money and Itsuki having won already, Itsuki decides to accept a second round under the condition that if Yumeko loses she can have her fingernails and toenails removed to add to her already extensive nail collection. Once again, Itsuki deals from the same two decks, confident that her cheating style of using heat-activated patterns in the cards will help her win again. However, Yumeko reveals to have picked up on her scheme since the first game and used her intellect to memorise the cards and match them to their corresponding matching card, winning the game on her first turn and remarking that Itsuki would have won had she used cards with different markings.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 3\n| Title               = Slit-Eyed Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Itome no Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u7cf8\u76ee\u306e\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = [[Shigeru Ueda]]\n| WrittenBy           = Yasuko Kobayashi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|7|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = Yumeko is invited to the Traditional Culture Research Society's clubroom just in time to witness Mary lose a high-stakes bet and adding 40 million yen to her debt.

After the first game ends in a draw, Yumeko goes all in, deducing that Yuriko has been cheating by having the dealer wear magnets on her hand to affect the movement of the swords. Just as Yuriko becomes panicked over the thought of potentially losing over 2 billion yen, several Student Council members, including the Student Council President Kirari Momobami, step in suddenly to observe the game. When the swords are unveiled, it reveals Yuriko's win, which Yumeko suspects may have been the result of an elaborate cheating method the Student Council used specifically for their game, by heading directly to the room underneath and using magnets to prevent her from winning.

With the increasing numbers of Pets, the Student Council announces a Debt Exchange Game, in which groups of four students play a game of two-card [[Indian poker]] to try and exchange their debts, with the winner losing their debt completely and even standing a chance to win money. Yumeko and Mary end up in the same group with Jun Kiwatari, a delinquent male student infamous for his cruel treatment of Pets and another Pet named Nanami Tsubomi.

Finally, Jun manages to move up to first but becomes panicked again when it looks like Nanami will overtake him and tries to coerce her into folding. After some provocation by Yumeko, however, Nanami rebels against Jun's orders. At the end of the match, Mary ends up in first place while Jun ends up in last, as it is revealed that Yumeko and Mary had switched the debts they keyed in to the game with each other, making Yumeko's of least value instead. As a result, Jun ends up with Yumeko's 310 million debt, Yumeko obtains Jun's fake 10 million debt and Mary's debt is cleared, while Nanami is left with the same debt she started with, but with a new sense of freedom and self-esteem.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 6\n| Title               = Tempting Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Sasou Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u8a98\u3046\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Takashi Kobayashi\n| WrittenBy           = Yasuko Kobayashi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|8|12}}{{efn|Only on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] episodes 6 and 7 aired on August 19 and August 20, 2017 due to the broadcast of the [[2017 World Championships in Athletics|World Championship in Athletics]].

Midari Ikishima, a Student Council member and the chairwoman of the Beautification Committee, decides to challenge Yumeko to a guessing game to tell which card order played by the dealer, and the winner of each round gets to point one of two revolvers at the loser and pull the trigger with neither knowing which of the guns' 6 chambers contain a bullet. Despite the possibility of losing her life, Yumeko agrees but only under the conditions that the game only last 3 rounds, Ryota must be the dealer, and the loser must pay 1 billion yen. To feel and enjoy the pain, Midari also adds another rule that should the winner miss her shot on purpose the loser can fire a shot in return. Once the game begins, Ryota gives Yumeko meaningless signs to make Midari falsely believe Yumeko knew which cards he played and would win, but Midari fully loads her gun with 6 bullets anyway, winding up scoring higher. Yumeko warns Midari that pulling the trigger is a bad idea but Midari ignores her.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 7\n| Title               = Refusing Women\n| TranslitTitle       = Kyozetsu-suru Onna-tachi\n| NativeTitle         = \u62d2\u7d76\u3059\u308b\u5973\u305f\u3061\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = K\u014dichir\u014d Kuroda\n| WrittenBy           = Yasuko Kobayashi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|8|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = Seconds before Midari fires, Yumeko claims it as her gun and how she sabotaged it to backfire, but Midari doesn't hesitate to shoot, revealing how Midari doesn't fear getting hurt or killed. This information is all Yumeko wanted, though; it was a bluff and the gun is unloaded. When questioned about her reasons, Midari reveals she blinded her left eye as payment for losing against the President and now only gambles when the risk is pain or death. In the second round Yumeko correctly matches every card as Ryota simply uses Yumeko's card order from round one. She chooses a revolver and fires, having chosen the revolver that weighed less due to being unloaded. In the final round, Midari puts Ryota under pressure by reversing the screen and giving him ten seconds to deal the cards; he deals them in the same order again. Having figured out the cheating by mirroring the cameras (Ryota is right handed but was somehow dealing with his left) from the beginning as Midari predicted, both of them load two bullets. As Midari wants to be shot, she aims to get no matches, knowing that with a full match Yumeko has to pull the trigger five times, guaranteeing at least one shot, but Yumeko ruins her plan by getting no matches, too, resulting in a draw. Yumeko finds playing with no risk boring and despises Midari for it. Midari, realizing she has been totally defeated, begs Yumeko to shoot her just once, but Yumeko refuses. Meanwhile, Mary refuses to join the council and swears revenge on Kirari. At the end of the game, to let her experience the thrill she had failed to have in the game with Midari, Yumeko challenges Ryota to [[Coin flipping|heads or tails]] and buys him sweets when she loses.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 8\n| Title               = Love-Dancing Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Aiodoru Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u611b\u8e0a\u308b\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Yasunori Got\u014d\n| WrittenBy           = Shigeru Murakoshi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|8|26}}\n| ShortSummary        = Kirari departs from the academy, leaving the rest of the Council unsure how to deal with Yumeko and letting the second-years Kaede Manyuda and Yumemi Yumemite take advantage of the situation to increase their authority.

As the head of PR and a YourTube Japanese idol, Yumemi bets Yumeko 50 million yen on the outcome of an on-stage idol championship competition where should Yumeko lose, Yumemi will alter her life schedule to force her into an idol duo with her, losing any hopes she has of a social life or meaningful relationships, much like Yumemi's own life.

For the final game they have to guess the birth month of members of the audience, and is crucial in that should Yumeko lose this game she loses the entire gamble. Yumemi, having memorised the birthdays of her entire fan club, is confident of her win, but panics when Yumeko manipulates dice and the audience member chosen is Mary. Yumeko tricks Yumemi into writing '9' on her card when she wrote '6', initially scaring her, but when Mary's birthday is revealed to be in March instead, Yumeko wins the game by her guess being 3 months closer, winning the entire game. The recording is played, but even so, Yumemi's fans still remain loyal to her. Yumeko, pleased at Yumemi's conviction, reveals that someone had attempted to sabotage Yumemi's career by sending her a ripped-up fan letter along with the challenge match prior. Yumemi then publicly accuses Kaede, who is the only plausible option for running the match with her. As Kaede denies any wrongdoing and announces his plans as the next President, Yumeko suggests they gamble to decide who is lying, declaring it an official match which he is not allowed to refuse.\n| LineColor           = AA1527\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 10\n| Title               = Selective Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Sentaku suru Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u9078\u629e\u3059\u308b\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Yasunori Got\u014d\n| WrittenBy           = Hiroshi Seko\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|9|9}}\n| ShortSummary        = Kirari attends a meeting with the heads of her extended family, all members of the Momobami clan. Back on stage, Kaede becomes convinced that Yumeko is simply a gambling addict who gambles for the thrill of it.

Like regular Poker, each player may discard and replace any number of cards once before betting. Yumeko uses her 310 million to 31 poker chips while Kaede buys a 100 for 1 billion. Yumeko wins the first round causing Kaede to factor in her love of risk-taking and uses his keen calculations and intellect to win the subsequent rounds. Yumeko is given the option to continue playing ([[Glossary of poker terms#rebuy|rebuy]]) and calls out to Itsuki in the audience for money. Kaede insults her but offers her Council seat back, prompting Yumeko to defend Itsuki as her friend and urges her to take a risk for the sake of her ambitions, rather than accept her seat back from Kaede as the safe way.

Yumeko suggests Itsuki bet her life, i.e. to receive a Life Schedule, and although she refuses at first but after seeing Yumeko\u2019s cards she rips out her own fingernails and willingly bets her life. Based on Itsuki\u2019s family wealth Ririka declares her Life Schedule to be worth 10 billion, prompting to Kaede challenge the decision. Ririka then removes her mask, revealing she is actually Kirari in disguise and that the two are twins. With Yumeko\u2019s bet now totalling 12 billion Kaede desperately bets his own Life Schedule for 10 billion and chooses strong. However, Yumeko reveals Itsuki\u2019s desperation was a plot to deceive Kaede into choosing strong and reveals she has three jacks, beating Kaede\u2019s three eights. Kaede ends up billions in debt and loses his Council seat. Yumeko and Kirari sit down to discuss their reasons for gambling, with both of them appearing to have some sort of attraction to each other.

Sumeragi and Mary believe a card with a lipstick smudge is the Fool. Although Yumeko says she is the only one with the risk of expulsion, Ryota vows to share her fate to be with her. Ryota is tempted to pick the marked card, but changes his mind at the last second suspecting that it is a ploy by Kirari, and eventually chooses totally at random, the risk factor arousing Yumeko intensely. The chosen card is worth 20 points, thus equalling Kirari's score. The game ends with Runa declares the match a draw and no one having to be expelled, but Kirari and Yumeko agree to gamble again in the future.

In the aftermath, Itsuki withdraws from the presidential election as she was more interested in winning the game than becoming Student Council president.\n| LineColor           = A6086F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 21\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 9\n| Title               = The Woman By Her Side\n| TranslitTitle       = Hata no Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u508d\u306e\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Yasunori Got\u014d<br>Kim Sang-yeob\n| WrittenBy           = Hiroshi Seko\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|3|5}}\n| ShortSummary        = Election Committee Chair, Runa Yomozuki gives an update on the election, naming the top 10 contenders, with Kirari Momobami still in front with a long lead, Terano Totobami in second place and Yumeko Jabami in sixth place. Yumeko suddenly challenges Kirari to a gamble, but Sayaka Igarashi, who is in love with Kirari in addition to being her loyal secretary, violently objects, and challenges Yumeko to a gamble for their lives. However, Yumeko ups the stakes of the bet: they agree that Sayaka will bet her relationship with Kirari against Yumeko's promise to never gamble again. Kirari proposes the game of Tower of Doors and as an added incentive, Kirari proposes that the loser jumps from the fifth floor, also forfeiting their life. Sayaka and Yumeko agree. The game begins and Yumeko opens a door which leads nowhere. Then Sayaka opens a trapdoor and descends one floor, but defying logic, Yumeko then opens a door in the external wall.\n| LineColor           = A6086F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 22\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 10\n| Title               = The Logical Woman\n| TranslitTitle       = Ri no Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u7406\u306e\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Hidekazu Hara\n| WrittenBy           = Hiroshi Seko\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|3|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = Runa Yomozuki theorises that many of the distributed votes are being held as [[Proxy voting|proxies]] for some of the front runners.

However, on the ascent, Yumeko reaches the top first, She had correctly guessed that the outer part of the tower rotated after she opened an outer door, and then used the central staircase to travel down and back up. Having lost by using logic rather than intuition, Sayaka opens one of the outer doors and jumps from the tower. Surprisingly Kirari jumps as well, grabbing Sayaka as they fall. They both survive, landing on a soft safety mat instead of hard ground. Kirari licks the blood off of Sayaka's forehead, and they embrace. Although Sayaka lost the bet, Kirari asks Sayaka to be her secretary again, explaining that she needs Sayaka, and that, as strangers, they can begin a new relationship.\n| LineColor           = A6086F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 23\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 11\n| Title               = The Woman Who Bears the X\n| TranslitTitle       = Batsu o seou Onna\n| NativeTitle         = \u00d7\u3092\u80cc\u8ca0\u3046\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Takeshi Sat\u014d\n| WrittenBy           = Shigeru Murakoshi\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|3|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = Yumeko, Saotome and the other students receive invitations to a \"Hundred Votes Auction\".

The bidding for the first lot goes quickly, with Saotome winning on a bid of 80 votes, however the unseen sponsor collected 130 votes from the bids. The second round goes to Nishinotoin, again with a winning bid of 80 votes. After the third round, Saotome realizes that Rei Batsubami is also bidding, and she forces Rei to stop bidding.

After she reveals that she is using hundreds of votes collected from non-competitive students betting on whether she would win the election, the game continues. In the next round, the competitors realize that they must continue at the risk of losing all the votes already bid and Yuriko Nishinotoin wins with a bid of 99 votes. Yumeko relishes what appears to be a no-win situation. In the succeeding rounds Yumeko quickly bids 101, winning the bids and intimidating the other players. She next bids 1 vote, winning 100 votes from Rei, more than covering her losses. The other competitors realize her strategy, and each bids 1 vote on succeeding rounds until Rei loses all her votes.

{"title_page": "Expense", "text_new": "'''Expenditure''' is an outflow of [[money]], or any form of [[Wealth|fortune]] in general, to another person or group to pay for an item or service, or for a category of [[cost]]s. For a [[leasehold estate|tenant]], [[renting|rent]] is an expense. For students or parents, [[tuition]] is an expense. Buying food, clothing, furniture or an automobile is often referred to as an expense. An expense is a cost that is \"paid\" or \"[[Remittance|remitted]]\", usually in exchange for something of value. Something that seems to cost a great deal is \"expensive\". Something that seems to cost little is \"inexpensive\". \"Expenses of the table\" are expenses of [[dining]], refreshments, a [[Banquet|feast]], etc.\n\nIn [[accounting]], '''expense''' has a very specific meaning. It is an outflow of cash or other valuable assets from a person or company to another person or company. This outflow of cash is generally one side of a trade for products or services that have equal or better current or future value to the buyer than to the seller. Technically, an expense is an event in which an [[asset]] is used up or a [[liability (accounting)|liability]] is incurred. In terms of the [[accounting equation]], expenses reduce owners' [[equity (finance)|equity]]. The [[International Accounting Standards Board]] defines expenses as:{{quote|...decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants.<ref>IFRS Framework, F.70</ref>}}\n\nExpense is a term also used in [[sociology]], in which a particular fortune or price is sacrificed voluntarily or involuntarily by something or someone to something or somebody else, often in the context that the ladder is taking advantage of the former.\n==Bookkeeping for expenses==\nIn [[double-entry bookkeeping]], expenses are recorded as a [[debit]] to an expense account (an [[income statement]] account) and a [[credit (finance)|credit]] to either an asset account or a liability account, which are [[balance sheet]] accounts. An expense decreases assets or increases liabilities. Typical business expenses include salaries, utilities, depreciation of capital assets, and interest expense for loans. The purchase of a capital asset such as a building or equipment is not an expense.\n\n==Cash flow==\nIn a [[cash flow statement]] (flow of funds statement), expenditures are divided into three categories:\n\n* Operating: [[Operating expense|Operational expense]] \u2013 salary for employees\n* Investing: [[Capital expenditure]] \u2013 buying equipment\n* Expenditures (financial) [[corporate finance|Financing expense]] \u2013 [[interest expense]] for [[loans]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]\n\nWhether a particular expenditure is classified as an expense, which is reported immediately on the business's [[income statement]] or whether it is classified as a [[capital expenditure]] (or an expenditure subject to [[depreciation]]) which is not an expense flow of funds statement. Though, these latter types of expenditures are reported as expenses when they are depreciated by businesses that use [[Cash-basis versus accrual-basis accounting|accrual-basis accounting]]- as most large businesses and all [[C corporation]]s do.\n\nDefining an expense as capital or income using the most common interpretation depends upon its term. \n\nWhen an expense is seen as a purchase it alleviates this distinction. Soon after the purchase, (that which was expenses holds no value), then it is usually identified as an expense. It will be viewed as capital with life that should be [[Amortization (business)|amortized]]/[[depreciation|depreciated]] and retained on the [[balance sheet]] if it retains value soon and long after the purchase.\n\n==Deduction of business expenses under the United States tax code==\nFor tax purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Code]] permits the deduction of business expenses in the tax payable year in which those expenses are paid or incurred. This is in contrast to [[capital expenditures]]<ref>Capital expenditures must recovered over a period of years through depreciation and amortization. ''See also'' [[Expenses versus Capital Expenditures]].</ref> that are paid or incurred to acquire an asset. Expenses are costs that do not acquire, improve, or prolong the life of an asset. For example, a person who buys a new truck for a business would be making a capital expenditure because they have acquired a new business-related asset. This cost could not be deducted in the current taxable year. However, the gas the person buys during that year to fuel that truck would be considered a deductible expense. The cost of purchasing gas does not improve or prolong the life of the truck but simply allows the truck to run.<ref>For more on this subject, see Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials 170-73 (2d ed. 2007).</ref>\n\nEven if something qualifies as an expense, it is not necessarily deductible. As a general rule, expenses are deductible if they relate to a taxpayer's trade or business activity or if the expense is paid or incurred in the production or collection of income from an activity that does not rise to the level of a trade or business (investment activity).\n\nSection 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is the deduction provision for business or trade expenses.<ref>{{USCSub|26|162|a}}</ref> In order to be a trade or business expense and qualify for a deduction, it must satisfy 5 elements in addition to qualifying as an expense. It must be (1) ordinary and (2) necessary (''[[Welch v. Helvering]]'' defines this as necessary for the development of the business at least in that they were appropriate and helpful). Expenses paid to preserve one's reputation do not appear to qualify).<ref>{{ussc|name=Welch v. Helvering|link=|volume=290|page=111|pin=113|year=1933}}</ref> In addition, it must be (3) paid or incurred during the taxable year. It must be paid (4) in carrying on (meaning not prior to the start of a business or in creating it) (5) a trade or business activity. To qualify as a trade or business activity, it must be continuous and regular, and profit must be the primary motive. An expense can be a loss or profit. But loss or profit need not really be an expense.\n\nSection 212 of the Internal Revenue Code is the deduction provision for investment expenses.<ref>{{USC|26|212}}</ref> In addition to being an expense and satisfying elements 1-4 above, expenses are deductible as an investment activity under Section 212 of the Internal Revenue Code if they are (1) for the production or collection of income, (2) for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income, or (3) in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax.\n\nIn investing, one [[controversy]] that mounted throughout 2002 and 2003 was whether companies should report the granting of [[stock option]]s to [[employee]]s as an expense on the [[income statement]], or should not report this at all in the income statement, which is what had previously been the norm.\n\n==Expense report==\nAn expense report is a form of document that contains all the expenses that an individual has incurred as a result of the business operation. For example, if the owner of a business travels to another location for a meeting, the cost of travel, the meals, and all other expenses that he/she has incurred may be added to the expense report. Consequently, these expenses will be considered business expenses and are tax deductible.\n\nMany businesses benefit from automated expense reports systems for [[expense management]]. Depending on the system chosen, these software solutions can reduce time costs, errors, and fraud.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amortization (business)]] \n* [[Balance sheet]]\n* [[Capital Expenditures]]\n* [[Cash flow statement]]\n* [[Depreciation]]\n* [[Expense management]]\n* [[Expenses versus Capital Expenditures]]\n* [[Income statement]]\n* [[Operating expense]]\n* [[Per diem]]\n* [[Stock option expensing]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p463/ch05.html IRS Expense Guidelines]\n\n\n[[Category:Expense| ]]\n\n[[cs:Finan\u010dn\u00ed n\u00e1klady]]\n[[pt:Custo]]\n[[ta:\u0b9a\u0bc6\u0bb2\u0bb5\u0bc1]]\n", "text_old": "'''Expenditure''' is an outflow of [[money]], or any form of [[fortune]] in general, to another person or group to pay for an item or service, or for a category of [[cost]]s.

The purchase of a capital asset such as a building or equipment is not an expense.\n\n==Cash flow==\nIn a [[cash flow statement]] (flow of funds statement), expenditures are divided into three categories:\n\n* Operating: [[Operating expense|Operational expense]] \u2013 salary for employees\n* Investing: [[Capital expenditure]] \u2013 buying equipment\n* Expenditures (financial) [[corporate finance|Financing expense]] \u2013 [[interest expense]] for [[loans]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]\n\nWhether a particular expenditure is classified as an expense, which is reported immediately on the business's [[income statement]] or whether it is classified as a [[capital expenditure]] (or an expenditure subject to [[depreciation]]) which is not an expense flow of funds statement. Though, these latter types of expenditures are reported as expenses when they are depreciated by businesses that use [[Cash-basis versus accrual-basis accounting|accrual-basis accounting]]- as most large businesses and all [[C corporation]]s do.\n\nDefining an expense as capital or income using the most common interpretation depends upon its term. \n\nWhen an expense is seen as a purchase it alleviates this distinction. Soon after the purchase, (that which was expenses holds no value), then it is usually identified as an expense. It will be viewed as capital with life that should be [[Amortization (business)|amortized]]/[[depreciation|depreciated]] and retained on the [[balance sheet]] if it retains value soon and long after the purchase.\n\n==Deduction of business expenses under the United States tax code==\nFor tax purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Code]] permits the deduction of business expenses in the tax payable year in which those expenses are paid or incurred. This is in contrast to [[capital expenditures]]<ref>Capital expenditures must recovered over a period of years through depreciation and amortization. ''See also'' [[Expenses versus Capital Expenditures]].</ref> that are paid or incurred to acquire an asset. Expenses are costs that do not acquire, improve, or prolong the life of an asset. For example, a person who buys a new truck for a business would be making a capital expenditure because they have acquired a new business-related asset. This cost could not be deducted in the current taxable year. However, the gas the person buys during that year to fuel that truck would be considered a deductible expense. The cost of purchasing gas does not improve or prolong the life of the truck but simply allows the truck to run.<ref>For more on this subject, see Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials 170-73 (2d ed. 2007).</ref>\n\nEven if something qualifies as an expense, it is not necessarily deductible. As a general rule, expenses are deductible if they relate to a taxpayer\u2019s trade or business activity or if the expense is paid or incurred in the production or collection of income from an activity that does not rise to the level of a trade or business (investment activity).\n\nSection 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is the deduction provision for business or trade expenses.<ref>{{USCSub|26|162|a}}</ref> In order to be a trade or business expense and qualify for a deduction, it must satisfy 5 elements in addition to qualifying as an expense. It must be (1) ordinary and (2) necessary (''[[Welch v. Helvering]]'' defines this as necessary for the development of the business at least in that they were appropriate and helpful). Expenses paid to preserve one\u2019s reputation do not appear to qualify).<ref>{{ussc|name=Welch v. Helvering|link=|volume=290|page=111|pin=113|year=1933}}</ref> In addition, it must be (3) paid or incurred during the taxable year. It must be paid (4) in carrying on (meaning not prior to the start of a business or in creating it) (5) a trade or business activity. To qualify as a trade or business activity, it must be continuous and regular, and profit must be the primary motive. An expense can be a loss or profit. But loss or profit need not really be an expense.\n\nSection 212 of the Internal Revenue Code is the deduction provision for investment expenses.<ref>{{USC|26|212}}</ref> In addition to being an expense and satisfying elements 1-4 above, expenses are deductible as an investment activity under Section 212 of the Internal Revenue Code if they are (1) for the production or collection of income, (2) for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income, or (3) in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax.\n\nIn investing, one [[controversy]] that mounted throughout 2002 and 2003 was whether companies should report the granting of [[stock option]]s to [[employee]]s as an expense on the [[income statement]], or should not report this at all in the income statement, which is what had previously been the norm.\n\n==Expense report==\nAn expense report is a form of document that contains all the expenses that an individual has incurred as a result of the business operation. For example, if the owner of a business travels to another location for a meeting, the cost of travel, the meals, and all other expenses that he/she has incurred may be added to the expense report. Consequently, these expenses will be considered business expenses and are tax deductible.\n\nMany businesses benefit from automated expense reports systems for [[expense management]]. Depending on the system chosen, these software solutions can reduce time costs, errors, and fraud.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amortization (business)]] \n* [[Balance sheet]]\n* [[Capital Expenditures]]\n* [[Cash flow statement]]\n* [[Depreciation]]\n* [[Expense management]]\n* [[Expenses versus Capital Expenditures]]\n* [[Income statement]]\n* [[Operating expense]]\n* [[Per diem]]\n* [[Stock option expensing]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p463/ch05.html IRS Expense Guidelines]\n\n\n[[Category:Expense| ]]\n\n[[cs:Finan\u010dn\u00ed n\u00e1klady]]\n[[pt:Custo]]\n[[ta:\u0b9a\u0bc6\u0bb2\u0bb5\u0bc1]]\n", "name_user": "GoingBatty", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 2 links to disambiguation pages -(You can help)-Advantage,Fortune/WP:WCWproject (Spelling and typography)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expense"}

For many thousands of years, humans wore no clothing, which continues to be the norm in some isolated indigenous societies in tropical climates. The widespread adoption of clothing only occurred as people migrated to other climates which required protection from the elements. As societies developed from being [[hunter-gatherer]]s to being agrarian, clothing became part of cultural evolution as individuals and groups became differentiated by status and class. In early civilizations such as Egypt, slaves, children, and others with lower status often continued to be naked.\n\nThe modern understanding of nudity is culturally complex due to different meanings given various states of undress in differing social situations. In any particular society, nudity is defined in relation to being properly dressed, not in relation to the specific body parts being exposed. For humans, nakedness and clothing are connected to many [[Culture|cultural categories]] such as [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[privacy]], [[social status]] and [[Morality|moral behavior]].{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|loc=Introduction}} Synonyms and euphemisms for nudity abound, including \"birthday suit\", \"in the altogether\" and \"in the buff\". \"In a [[state of nature]]\" is also used by philosophers to refer to the state of humans before the existence of organized societies.<ref name=\"Websters.nude\"/>\n\nIn [[Western world|Western societies]], there are two contradictory cultural traditions relating to nudity. The first comes from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who saw the naked body as the natural state and as essentially positive. The second is based upon the [[Abrahamic religions]], which have viewed being naked as shameful and essentially negative. The fundamental teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam prohibit public, and sometimes also private nudity. However, the interaction between the Greek classical and later traditions has resulted in Western ambivalence, with nudity representing both positive and negative meanings in individual psychology, in social life, and in depictions such as art.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=11\u201315}} In the late 19th century, organized groups of nudists or naturists emerged with the stated purpose of regaining a natural connection to the human body and nature, sometimes in private spaces but also in public.\n\nIn Africa, there is a sharp contrast between the attitude toward nudity in Islamic countries and the attitude toward nudity in certain [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan countries]] that never abandoned, or are reasserting, precolonial norms.\n\nIn Asia, the norms regarding public nudity are in keeping with the cultural values of social propriety and human dignity. Rather than being perceived as immoral or shameful, nakedness is perceived as a breach of [[etiquette]] and perhaps as an embarrassment. In China, [[Face (sociological concept)|saving face]] is a powerful social force. In Japan, proper behavior included a tradition of mixed gender public baths before Western contact began in the 19th century, and proper attire for farmers and other workers might be a loincloth for both men and women. In India, the conventions regarding proper dress do not apply to monks in some Hindu and Jain sects who reject clothing as worldly.\n\nSocieties use clothing (or the lack thereof) as a marker of social status. Generally, social norms regarding nudity are different for men than they are for women. It was not until the 17th century in Europe that the female breast became a part of the body that must be covered in public. It is only in the modern era that the nudity of children represented anything but innocence. Individuals may intentionally violate norms regarding nudity; those without power may use nudity as a form of protest, and those with power may impose nakedness on others as a form of punishment.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of nudity}}\n<!--Opening of main article and summary of what follows -->\nThe history of nudity involves social attitudes to nakedness of the human body in different cultures in history. The use of clothing is one of the changes that mark the end of the [[Neolithic]] and the beginning of civilization.\n=== Prehistory ===\n<!--Defined as period before recorded history-->\n==== Evolution of hairlessness ====\n{{main|Human evolution}}\nThe dissipation of body heat remains the most widely accepted evolutionary explanation for the loss of body hair in early members of the genus [[homo]], the surviving member of which is modern humans.{{sfn|Kushlan|1980}}{{sfn|Wheeler|1985}}{{sfn|Sutou|2012}} Less hair, and an increase in sweat glands, made it easier for their bodies to cool when they moved from shady [[forest]] to open [[savanna]]. This change in environment also resulted in a change in diet, from largely vegetarian to hunting. Pursuing game on the savanna also increased the need for regulation of body heat.{{sfn|Daley|2018}}  Anthropologist and palaeobiologist [[Nina Jablonski]] posits that the ability to dissipate excess body heat through [[Eccrine sweat gland|eccrine sweating]] helped make possible the dramatic enlargement of the brain, the most temperature-sensitive human organ.{{sfn|Jablonski|2012}} Thus the loss of fur was also a factor in further adaptions, both physical and behavioral, that differentiated humans from other primates. Some of these changes are thought to be the result of sexual selection, which was first proposed by Darwin in [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]. By selecting more hairless mates, humans accelerated changes initiated by natural selection. Sexual selection may also account for the remaining human hair in the pubic area and armpits, which are sites for pheromones, while hair on the head continued to provide protection from the sun.{{sfn|Wade|2003}}\n\nA divergent explanation of humans' relative hairlessness holds that ecroparasites (such as ticks) residing in fur became problematic as humans became hunters living in larger groups with a \"home base\". Nakedness would also make the lack of parasites apparent to prospective mates.{{sfn|Rantala|2007|pp=1\u20137}}\n\nThe last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees was only partially bipedal, often using their front legs for locomotion. Other primate mothers do not need to carry their young because there is fur for them to cling to, but the loss of fur encouraged full bipedalism, allowing the mothers to carry their babies with one or both hands. The combination of hairlessness and upright posture may also explain the enlargement of the female breasts as a sexual signal.{{sfn|Sutou|2012}}\n\nWith the loss of fur, darker, high-melanin skin evolved as a protection from ultraviolet radiation damage. As humans migrated outside of the tropics, varying degrees of depigmentation evolved in order to permit UVB-induced synthesis of previtamin D<sub>3</sub>.{{sfn|Jablonski|Chaplin|2000|pp=57\u2013106}}{{sfn|Jablonski|Chaplin|2017}}\n\n==== Origin of clothing ====\n{{main|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThe wearing of clothing is most likely a behavioral [[adaptation]] arising from the need for protection from the elements, including the sun (for depigmented human populations) and cold temperatures as humans migrated to colder regions. According to a 2010 study published in ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'', estimates of the origins of clothing are based upon a genetic analysis indicating that clothing lice diverged from head louse ancestors at some point in time between 83,000 years ago and 170,000 years ago; this information suggests that the use of clothing likely originated with anatomically modern humans in Africa prior to their migration to colder climates.{{sfn| Toups| Kitchen| Light| Reed| 2010| pp=29\u201332}} A 2017 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' estimated that anatomically modern humans evolved 260,000 to 350,000 years ago.{{sfn| Schlebusch| 2017}} \n\nThe complex garments needed for survival in extreme cold would have required invention of the tools for turning animal skins into clothes: scrapers for cleaning and smoothing, fine stone knives for cutting and bone needles for stitching.{{sfn|Gilligan|2010}} What is now called clothing may have originated along with other types of adornment, including [[jewelry]], [[body paint]], [[tattoo]]s, and other [[body modification]]s, \"dressing\" the naked body without concealing it.{{sfn|Hollander|1978|p=83}} According to Leary and Buttermore, body adornment is one of the changes that occurred in the late [[Paleolithic]] (40,000 to 60,000 years ago) in which humans became not only anatomically modern, but also [[Behavioral modernity|culturally and psychologically modern]] and capable of self-reflection and symbolic interaction.{{sfn|Leary|Buttermore|2003}}\n\n=== Ancient history ===\n<!--Defined as period from beginning of recorded history to the end of the classical period, about 3000 BCE to 500 CE. Preliterate societies, unless mentioned in written history (usually as savages and barbarians), are not part of history.-->\n[[File:Fetekti3c.jpg| thumb| left| 240px| Scenes painted on white plaster, Fifth Dynasty (approx. 2500\u20132300 BCE), [[Abusir]] necropolis, [[Egypt]]]]\nIn ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most people owned a single item of clothing, and being naked meant being at the bottom of the social scale, lacking in dignity and status.{{sfn|Batten|2010}}\n\nFor the average person, clothing changed little in [[ancient Egypt]] from the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]], (3150\u20132686 BCE) until the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (2055\u20131650 BCE). Although the genitals of adults were generally covered, nakedness in ancient Egypt was not a violation of any social norm, but more often a convention indicating wealth; those that could afford to do so covered more.{{sfn|Mertz|1990|p=75}} Both men and women wore skirts called ''schenti''\u2014which evolved from [[loincloth]]s and resembled modern kilts. Slaves and laborers were nude or wore loincloths. Only women of the upper classes wore  ''[[kalasiris]]'', a dress of loose draped or translucent linen which came from just above or below the breasts to the ankles.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} Women entertainers performed naked. Children went without clothing until [[puberty]], at about age 12.{{sfn|Altenm\u00fcller|1998|pp=406\u20137}} It was not until the later periods, in particular the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1550\u20131069 BCE), that functionaries in the households of the wealthy also began wearing more refined dress, and upper class women wore elaborate dresses and ornamentation which covered their breasts. These later styles are often shown in film and TV as representing ancient Egypt in all periods.{{sfn|Mark|2017}}\n\nMale nudity was celebrated in [[ancient Greece]] as in no culture before or since. They considered embarrassment at having to disrobe for sports a sign of barbarism.{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=57}} The female nude emerged as a subject for art in the 5th century BCE, illustrating stories of women bathing both indoors and outdoors. While depictions of nude women were erotic in nature, there was no attribution of impropriety as would be the case for such images in later Western culture. However, the passive images reflected the unequal status of women in society compared to the athletic and heroic images of naked men.{{sfn| Kosso| Scott| 2009| pp=61-86}}\n\nThe [[toga]] was essential to announce the status and rank of male [[Roman citizenship|citizens at Rome]].{{sfn|Habinek|Schiesaro|1997|p=39}} The poet [[Ennius]] (c. 239\u2013169&nbsp;BCE) declared, \"exposing naked bodies among citizens is the beginning of public disgrace\". [[Cicero]] endorsed Ennius' words.{{sfn|Cicero|1927|p=[https://www.loebclassics.com/view/marcus_tullius_cicero-tusculan_disputations/1927/pb_LCL141.409.xml 408]}} An exception was the Roman baths ([[thermae]]), which had many social functions.{{sfn|Fagan|2002}}\n[[File:Stamnos women bath Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2411.jpg| thumb| right| 180px| Three young women bathing. Side B from an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure [[stamnos]], 440\u2013430 BCE.]]\nClothing used in the Middle East, which loosely envelopes the entire body, changed little for centuries. In part, this consistency arises from the fact that such clothing is well-suited for the climate (protecting the body from [[dust storm]]s while also allowing cooling by evaporation).<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> The meaning of the naked body in the societies based upon the [[Abrahamic religions]] ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]) was defined by a creation narrative in which [[Adam and Eve]], the [[Protoplast (religion)|first]] [[Adam|man]] and [[Eve|woman]], were naked and unashamed until they ate the [[forbidden fruit]] of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]]. The philosophical meaning of this myth in terms of stating the source of shame is unclear. The \"[[original sin]]\" did not involve nakedness, but disobedience, yet the first response was to cover their bodies with fig leaves.{{sfn|Velleman|2001}} In all three religions, modesty generally prevails in public, with clothing covering all parts of the body of a sexual nature. The [[Torah]] set forth laws regarding clothing and modesty (''[[tzniut]]'') which also separated Jews from other people in the societies they lived within.{{sfn|Silverman|2013}} \n\nEarly Christians generally inherited the norms of dress from Jewish traditions. However, the [[Adamites]] were an obscure Christian sect in [[North Africa]] originating in the second century who worshiped in the nude, professing to have regained the innocence of Adam.{{sfn|Livingstone|2013}} [[Islamic clothing]] for both men and women is in accordance with the rules of [[hajib]]. For men, clothing covers the area from the waist to the knees. For women, clothing covers the area from the neck to the ankles and also covers the hair. The practice known as [[veil]]ing of women in public predates Islam in [[Iran|Persia]], [[Assyria|Syria]], and [[Anatolia]]. The [[Qur\u02be\u0101n]] provides guidance on the dress of women, but not strict rulings;<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> such rulings may be found in the [[Hadith]]. Originally, veiling applied only to the wives of [[Muhammad]]; however, veiling was adopted by all upper-class women after his death and became a symbol of [[Muslim]] identity.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2013}}\n\nIn stories written in [[Zhou dynasty|China]] as early as the fourth century BCE, nudity is presented as an affront to [[human dignity]], reflecting the belief that \"humanness\" in Chinese society is not innate, but is earned by correct behavior. However, nakedness could also be used by an individual to express contempt for others in their presence. In other stories, the nudity of women, emanating the power of ''[[Yin and yang|yin]]'', could nullify the ''yang'' of aggressive forces.{{sfn|Henry|1999|pp=475\u2013486}} Nudity in mixed-gender public baths was common in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] before the effects of Western influence, which began in the 19th century and became extensive during the [[Occupation of Japan|American occupation]] after [[World War II]]. The practice continues at a dwindling number of hot springs (''konyoku'') outside of urban areas.{{sfn|Hadfield|2016}} Another Japanese tradition was the women [[free-diver]]s (''[[Ama (diving)|ama]]'') who for 2,000 years until the 1960s collected seaweed and shellfish wearing only loincloths. Their nakedness was not shocking, since women farmers often worked bare-breasted during the summer.{{sfn|Martinez|1995}}\n\n=== Post-classical history ===\nThe late fourth century CE was a period of both of Christian conversion and standardization of church teachings, in particular on matters of sex. Sex outside marriage with a respectable woman injured third parties; her husband, father, and male relatives. Fornication with an unattached woman, likely a prostitute, courtesan or slave, was a lesser sin since it had no male victims, which in a patriarchal society might mean no victim at all.{{sfn|Harper|2012}} The dress or nakedness of women that were not deemed respectable was also of lesser importance.{{sfn|Glancy|2015}}\n\nThe period between the ancient and modern world\u2014approximately 500 to 1450 CE\u2014saw an increasingly stratified society in Europe. At the beginning of the period, everyone other that the upper classes lived in close quarters and did not have the modern sensitivity to private nudity, but slept and bathed together naked with innocence rather than shame. The Roman baths in [[Bath, Somerset]], were rebuilt, and used by both sexes without garments until the 15th century.{{sfn|Byrde|1987}} Sects with beliefs similar to the Adamites, who worshiped naked, emerged in the early 15th century.{{sfn|Lerner|1972}} Later in the period, with the emergence of a middle class, clothing in the form of fashion was a significant indicator of [[social|class]], and thus its lack became a greater source of [[embarrassment]].{{sfn|Classen|2008}}\n\n[[File:Jan Gossaert - Virgin and Child - WGA9771.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Virgin and Child (c. 1530) by [[Jan Gossaert]] ]]\nUntil the beginning of the eighth century, Christians were [[Baptism|baptized]] naked to represent that they emerged from baptism without sin.{{snf|Veyne|1987|p=455}} Although there is a common misconception that Europeans did not bathe in the [[Middle Ages]], public bath houses\u2014usually segregated by sex\u2014were popular until the 16th century, when concern for the spread of disease closed many of them.<ref name=\"Medievalists\" /> In Christian Europe, the parts of the body that were required to be covered in public did not always include the female breasts. In 1350, breasts were associated with nourishment and loving care, but by 1750, artistic representations of the breast were either erotic or medical. This eroticization of the breast coincided with the persecution of women as witches.{{sfn|Miles|Lyon|2008}}\n\nIn the medieval period, Islamic norms became more patriarchal, and very concerned with the chastity of women before marriage and fidelity afterward. Women were not only veiled, but segregated from society, with no contact with men not of close kinship, the presence of whom defined the difference between public and private spaces.{{sfn|Lindsay|2005|p=173}} Of particular concern for both Islam and early Christians, as they extended their control over countries that had previously been part of the Byzantine or Roman empires, was the local custom of public bathing. While Christians were mainly concerned about mixed-gender bathing, which was not uncommon, Islam prohibited nudity for women in the company of non-Muslim women.{{sfn| Kosso| Scott| 2009| pp=171-190}}\n\n=== Modern history ===\n==== Early modern ====\n<!-- About 1500 to 1850, aka the Age of Discovery and Colonialism -->\nThe association of nakedness with shame and anxiety became ambivalent during the [[Renaissance]]. The rediscovered art and writings of [[ancient Greece]] offered an alternative tradition of nudity as symbolic of innocence and purity  which could be understood in terms of the state of man \"[[Fall of man|before the fall]]\". Subsequently, norms and behaviors surrounding nudity in life and in works of art diverged during the modern history of individual societies.{{snf|Barcan|2004a|loc=chpt. 2}}\n\nDue to concerns about the spread of disease, many European public bath houses closed in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Medievalists\" /> By 1750, European artistic representations of the female breast were either erotic or medical.{{sfn|Miles|Lyon|2008}}\n\nThe age of [[colonialism]] was marked by frequent encounters between Christian and Muslim cultures and indigenous peoples of the tropics ([[Nudity#Tropical cultures|see below]]), leading to the [[stereotype]] of the \"naked savage\".{{sfn|Stevens|2003|pp=124\u2013140}}\n\nIn England during the 17th to 19th centuries, the clothing of the poor by Christian charity did not extend to those confined to \"madhouses\" such as [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]], where the inmates were often kept naked and treated harshly.{{sfn|Andrews|2007|pp=131\u2013156}}\n\nThe [[Victorian Era#Morality|Victorian Era]] is often considered to be entirely restrictive of nudity. However, throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century, workers in [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|coal]] [[Coal mining|mine]]s were naked due to the heat and the narrow tunnels that would catch on clothing. Men and boys worked fully naked, while women and girls (usually employed as \"[[Hurrying|hurriers]]\") would generally only strip to the waist (in some locations, they were fully naked as well). Testimony before a Parliamentary labour commission revealed that working naked in confined spaces made \"sexual vices\" a \"common occurrence\".<ref name=\"FordhamU\"/>\n\n==== Late modern ====\nPublic swimming pools in the U.S. were the product of municipal reform movements beginning in the mid-19th century. Civic leaders had not intended pools to be used for recreation, but for health and sporting activities, which were male only. Initially, working class men and boys swam in the nude, as had previously been customary in lakes and rivers.{{sfn|Wiltse|2003}} Communal male nudity in the [[United States]] and other Western countries was not a taboo for much of the 20th century.<ref name=\"HistoricArchive\"/> Males have been more likely than females to be expected to swim nude in swimming pools or to share communal showers in school locker rooms with other members of the same sex.{{sfn|Smithers|1999}} These expectations were based on cultural beliefs that females need more privacy than males do.{{sfn|Senelick|2014}} A 1963 article on a swim program in [[Troy, New York]] stated that boys swam nude, but that girls were expected to wear bathing suits; the writer of the article found nothing remarkable about these requirements.{{sfn|Mann|1963}} The era of nude swimming by boys in municipal pools ended when mixed-gender bathing was allowed.{{sfn|Wiltse|2003}}\n\nIn 1974, an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted an increase in American tolerance for nudity, both at home and in public, approaching that of Europe. However, some traditional nudists at the time decried the trend as encouraging sexual exhibitionism and voyeurism and threatening the viability of private nudist clubs.{{sfn|Sterba|1974}}\n\n=== Traditional cultures ===\nIn tropical regions worldwide complete or near nudity was common for both men and women before contact with [[Western culture]]s or [[Islam]]. Some contemporary societies, particularly in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[Amazon rainforest]], maintain their traditional norms, going about their everyday activities either nude or partially nude.

The report asserted that children have a natural curiosity about their own bodies and the bodies of others that ought to be addressed in an age-appropriate manner. According to the report:\n*Children less than four years old will normally touch their own private parts, look at the private parts of others, and remove their clothes wanting to be naked;\n*Between ages four and six, children will be more actively curious. They will attempt to see others dressing or undressing, or will perhaps \"[[playing doctor|play doctor]]\"; and\n*Between ages six and twelve, children will expand their curiosity to images of undressed people available in the media. They will develop a need for privacy regarding their own bodies and begin to be sexually attracted to peers.\nThe report recommended that parents learn what is normal in regard to nudity and sexuality at each stage of a child's development and refrain from overreacting to their children's nudity-related behaviors unless there are signs of a problem (e.g. anxiety, aggression, or sexual interactions between children not of the same age or stage of development).<ref name=\"NTCSN.2009\"/>\n\nThe naturist/nudist point of view is that children are \"nudists at heart\" and that naturism provides the ideal environment for healthy development. It is noted that modern psychology generally agrees that children can benefit from an open environment where the bodies of others their own age of both sexes are not a mystery. However, there is less agreement regarding children and adults being nude. While some doctors have taken the view that some exposure of children to adult nudity (particularly parental nudity) may be healthy, others\u2014notably [[Benjamin Spock]]\u2014disagreed. Spock's view was later attributed to the lingering effect of [[Freudianism]] on the medical profession.{{sfn|Shantz|2017}}\n\n{{anchor|Nudity and children}}\nIn their 1986 study on the effects of social nudity on children, Smith and Sparks concluded that \"the viewing of the unclothed body, far from being destructive to the psyche, seems to be either benign or to actually provide positive benefits to the individuals involved.{{sfn|Smith|Sparks|1986|p=183}} In 1995, Gordon and Schroeder contended that \"there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them\", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They noted that by ages five to six, children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommended to parents who desire to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they respect a child's modesty from that age onwards.{{sfn|Gordon|Schroeder|1995|p=16}} \n\nIn a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect.{{sfn|Okami|1995|pp=51\u201364}} Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.{{sfn|Okami|Olmstead|Abramson|Pendleton|1998|pp=361\u2013384}} \n\nIn 1999, psychologist Barbara Bonner recommended against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic.{{sfn|Bonner|1999|p=211}} In 2019, psychiatrist Lea Lis recommended that parents allow nudity as a natural part of family life when children are very young, but to respect the modesty that is likely to emerge with puberty.{{sfn|Lis|2019}}\n{{Gallery\n| title        = Cultural differences in childhood nudity\n| align        =\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| height       = 180\n| width        =\n| captionstyle =\n| File:Recreational swim in the Greenbrier river for campers, who are children of miners.

The Culture Minister defended the book's being available for parents, and supported libraries that were under attack.{{sfn|Marosevic|2014}}\n\nAs part of a science program on Norwegian public television ([[NRK]]), a series on [[puberty]] intended for 8\u201312 year olds includes explicit information and images of reproduction, anatomy, and the changes that are normal with the approach of puberty. Rather than diagrams or photos, the videos are shot in a locker room with live nude people of all ages. The presenter, a physician, is relaxed about close examination and touching of relevant body parts, including genitals. While the videos note that the age of consent in Norway is 16, abstinence is not emphasized. In a subsequent series for teens and young adults, real people were recruited to have sex on tv as counterbalance to the unrealistic presentations in advertising and porn.<ref name=\"CultureTrip.2017\"/>\n\nAs of 2015, however, 37 U.S. states required that sex education curricula include lessons on abstinence and 25 required that a \u201cjust say no\u201d approach be stressed. Studies show that early and complete sex education does not increase the likelihood of becoming sexually active, but leads to better health outcomes overall.{{snf|Zadrozny|2015}} The Netherlands also has open and comprehensive sex education beginning as early as age 4, which similar health outcomes, in addition to promoting social benefits such as gender equality. Young children often play outdoors or in public wading pools nude.{{sfn|Rough|2018}}\n\nIn a 2018 survey of predominantly white middle-class college students in the United States, only 9.98% of women and 7.04% of men reported seeing real people (either adults or other children) as their first childhood experience of nudity. Many were accidental (walking in on someone) and were more likely to be remembered as negative by women. Only 4.72% of women and 2% of men reported seeing nude images as part of sex education. 83.59% of women and 89.45% of men reported that their first image of nudity was in film, video, or other mass media.{{sfn|Allen| Gary| Lavender-Stott| Kaestle|2018}}\n\n====High and low context cultures====\n{{also| Naturism in Germany| Naturism in France}}\nHigh and low context cultures were defined by [[Edward T. Hall]]. The behaviors and norms of a high context culture depend upon shared implicit intuitions that operate within a social situation, while in a low context culture behavior is more dependent upon explicit communications.{{sfn|Hall|1989}} An example of this distinction was found in research on the behavior of French and German naturists on a nude beach. Germans are extremely low in cultural context. They are characterized by individualism, alienation, estrangement from other people, little body contact, low sensitivity to nonverbal cues, and segmentation of time and space. By contrast, the French, in their personal lives are relatively high context: they interact within closely knit groups, are sensitive to nonverbal cues, and engage in relatively high amounts of body contact. To maintain public propriety on a nude beach, German naturists avoided touching themselves and others and avoid any adornments or behaviors that would call attention to the body. French naturists, on the other hand, were more likely than Germans to wear make-up and jewelry and to touch others as they would while dressed.{{sfn|Smith|1980}}\n\n====Concepts of privacy====\nSocieties in [[continental Europe]] conceive of privacy as protecting a right to respect and personal dignity. In America, the right to privacy is oriented toward values of liberty, especially in one's home. While Europeans maintain their dignity, even while naked where others may see them, Americans see public nakedness as a surrender of \"any reasonable [[expectation of privacy]]\". Such cultural differences may make some laws and behaviors of other societies seem incomprehensible.{{sfn|Whitman|2004|p=9}}\n\n==== Gender differences ====\n{{also|Sex differences in humans|Breast#Society and culture}}\nIn Western cultures, shame can result from not living up to the ideals of society with regard to physical appearance. Historically, such shame has affected women more than men. With regard to their naked bodies, the result is a tendency towards self-criticism by women, while men are less concerned by the evaluation of others.{{sfn|Weinberg|Williams|2010}}\n\n[[File:3 Topless Females Sunbathing on a Beach.JPG|thumb|left|In many European counties women may sunbathe without covering their breasts.]]\n\nIn much of the world, the modesty of women is a matter not only of social custom but of the legal definition of [[Indecent exposure#United States|indecent exposure]]. In the United States, the exposure of female nipples is a criminal offense in many states and is not usually allowed in public.{{sfn|Williams|2019}} \n\nThe \"[[topfreedom]]\" movement promotes equal rights for women to be naked above the waist in public on the same basis that would apply to men in the same circumstances.{{sfn|Jensen|2004}}\n\n[[Breastfeeding in public]] is forbidden in some [[jurisdiction]]s, not regulated in others, and protected as a legal right in public and the workplace in still others. Where public breastfeeding is a legal right, some mothers may be reluctant to [[breastfeed]],{{sfn|Wolf|2008|p=11}}{{sfn|Vance|2005|pp=51\u201354}} and some people may object to the practice.{{sfn|Jordan|Pile|2003|p=233}}\n\n=== Imposed nudity ===\n{{also|Pantsing}}\n\n==== Punishment ====\nIn some situations, nudity is forced on a person. For example, imposed nudity (full or partial) can be part of a [[corporal punishment]] or as [[public humiliation|humiliation]], especially when administered in public.\n\nFor example, in 2017, students at a girls' school in the north-east Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] were forced to undress as a form of punishment, police say. Although not as common as [[corporal punishment]], it is not unusual for stripping to be used as a form of punishment in Indian schools.<ref name=\"BBC.2017\"/>\n====Torture====\n[[File:Abu-ghraib-leash.jpg|thumb|180px|One of the iconic photographs of the [[Abu Ghraib]] prison torture scandal: a naked prisoner being forced to crawl and bark like a dog on a leash. ]]\n\n[[Nazism|Nazis]] used forced nudity to attempt to humiliate inmates in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. This practice was depicted in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1994).{{sfn|McDonald|Swaak-Goldman|2000|pp=280\u2013283}}\n\nIn 2003, [[Baghdad Central Prison|Abu Ghraib prison]] in [[Baghdad]] ([[Iraq]]) gained international notoriety for accounts of [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|torture and abuses]] by members of the [[United States Army Reserve]] during the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003\u2013present|post-invasion period]]. Photographic images were circulated that showed the posing of prisoners naked, sometimes bound, and being intimidated and otherwise humiliated, resulting in widespread condemnation of the abuse.<ref name=\"CNN.2004\" />{{sfn|Hoge|2004}}\n\n==== Strip search ====\n{{Main|Strip search}}\nA strip search is the removal of some or all of a person's clothing to insure that they do not have weapons or contraband. Such searches are generally done when an individual is imprisoned after an arrest, and is justified by the need to maintain order in the facility, not as punishment for a crime.<ref name=\"FindLaw\"/>\n\n===Laws regarding public nudity===\n{{Main|Indecent exposure|Clothing laws by country}}\nSince regulation of everyday public behavior is more often a matter of social convention than written law, some jurisdictions may have no specific law against nudity in public. This was the case in 2006, when three young men who had been skinny-dipping outside [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] decided to go into town to see what would happen if they disrobed there. They were not arrested, and the following two summers saw a number of incidents of public nakedness until an ordinance banning nudity was passed.{{sfn|Anand|2008}}\n\nIn the 21st century [[United States]], the legal definition of \"full nudity\" is exposure of the genitals. \"Partial nudity\" includes exposure of the [[buttocks]] by either sex or exposure of the female [[breast]]s.<ref name=\"LawInsider\" /> Legal definitions are further complicated by laws regarding [[indecent exposure]]; this term generally refers to engaging in public nudity with an intent to offend common decency.<ref name=\"Websters\"/> Lewd and indecent behavior is usually defined as causing alarm, discomfort, or annoyance for the average person. Where the law has been challenged by asserting that nudity by itself in not lewd or disorderly, laws have been amended to specify indecent exposure, usually of the genitals but not always of the breast. Public indecency in generally a [[misdemeanor]], but may become a [[felony]] upon repeated offense or always if done in the presence of a minor.{{sfn|Posner|Silbaugh|1996|loc=chpt. 6}} In the State of Oregon, public nudity is legal and protected as free speech as long as there is not an \"intent to arouse\".{{sfn|Hale|2015}} At the other extreme, the State of Arkansas not only outlaws private nudism, but bans anyone from advocating the practice.{{sfn|Posner|Silbaugh|1996|p=85}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, nudity may not be used to \"harass, alarm or distress\" according to the Public Order Act of 1986.{{sfn|Arfin|2019}} According to a police spokesperson in 2013, nudity per se is not unlawful in the United Kingdom; however, the circumstances surrounding particular episodes of nudity may create public order offenses. Most naturists comply with the law by being nude only where others cannot see them.<ref name=\"BBC.2013\"/> After repeated arrests, prosecutions, and convictions in Great Britain, the activist [[Stephen Gough]] sued at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for the right to be nude in public outside of designated areas. His claim was ultimately rejected.{{sfn|Shaw|2014}}\n\nThe brief, sudden exposure of parts of the body normally hidden from public view has a long tradition, taking several forms, which may or may not prompt legal action.\n* Flashing refers to the brief public exposure of the genitals or female breasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=46422|title=Definition of Flashing|website=MedicineNet}}</ref> At [[Mardi Gras]] in [[New Orleans]] flashing\u2014an activity that would be prohibited at any other time and place\u2014has become a ritual of long standing in celebration of [[carnival]]. While many celebrations of carnival worldwide include minimal costumes, the extent of nudity in the [[French Quarter]] is due to its long history as a \"[[red light district]]\". The ritual \"disrobing\" is done in the context of a performance which earns a payment, even though it is only symbolic (glass beads). Although the majority of those performing continue to be women, men (both homosexual and heterosexual) now also participate.{{sfn|Shrum|Kilburn|1996}}\n* [[Mooning]] refers to exposure of the buttocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2012/06/mooning-a-history-when-did-people-start-baring-their-butts-as-an-insult.html|title=When Did People Start Mooning Each Other?|first=Forrest|last=Wickman|date=27 June 2012|website=Slate Magazine}}</ref>  Mooning opponents in sports or in battle as an insult may have a history going back to ancient Rome.{{sfn|Wickman|2012}}\n* [[Streaking]] refers to running nude through a public area for publicity, as a [[prank]], as a dare, or as a form of [[protest]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/stripped-of-inhibitions-486277171.html|title=Jun 2018: Streakers make some events memorable for wrong reasons|first=Doug|last=Speirs|date=23 June 2018|via=www.winnipegfreepress.com|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press}}</ref>\n\n===Morality===\n{{also|Nudity in religion}}\n[[Shame]] is one of the [[moral emotions]] often associated with nudity. While [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] is the emotion experienced in response to a particular wrong action, shame is a more general and long-lasting self-assessment.{{sfn|Uebel|2019}} Shame is often thought of as positive in response to a failure to act in accordance with moral values, thus motivating an individual to do better in the future. However, shame is often negative as the response to perceived failures to live up to unrealistic expectations. The shame regarding nudity is one of the classic examples of the emotion, yet rather than being a positive motivator, it is considered unhealthy, standing in the way of developing a positive self-image.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|loc=chpt. 1}} Others argue that the shame felt when naked in public is due to valuing modesty and privacy as socially positive.{{sfn| Deonna| Rodogno| Teroni| 2012}} However, the response to such public exposure of normally private behavior is called embarrassment (like guilt, also a short-term emotion), rather than shame.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|p=11}}\n\nThe moral ambiguity of nudity is reflected in its many meanings, often expressed in the [[Conceptual metaphor| metaphors]] used to describe cultural values, both positive and negative.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=77\u201383}} \n\nOne of the first\u2014but now obsolete\u2014meanings of ''nude'' in the 16th century was \"mere, plain, open, explicit\" reflected in the modern metaphors \"the naked truth\", \"the bare facts\". Naturists often speak of their nakedness in terms of a return to the innocence and simplicity of childhood. The term naturism is based upon nakedness as being connected to nature in a positive way; which includes [[egalitarianism]], that all humans are alike in their nakedness. Nudity also represents freedom; the liberation of the body is associated with sexual liberation, although many naturists tend to downplay this connection. In some forms of [[Nude psychotherapy|group psychotherapy]], nudity has been used to promote open interaction and communication. Religious persons who reject the world as it is including all possessions may practice nudism, or use nakedness as a protest against an unjust world.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=83\u2013106}}\n\nMany of the negative associations are the inverse of positive ones. If nudity is truth, nakedness may be an invasion of privacy or the exposure of uncomfortable truths, a source of anxiety. The strong connection of nudity to sex produces shame when naked in contexts where sexuality is deemed inappropriate. Rather than being natural, nakedness is associated with savagery, poverty, criminality, and death. To be deprived of clothes is punishment; humiliating and degrading.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=106\u2013138}}\n\nConfronted with this ambiguity, some individuals seek to resolve it by working toward greater acceptance of nudity for themselves and others. The majority of naturists go through stages during which they gradually learn a new set of values regarding the human body.{{sfn|G\u00f3rnicka|2016|}} However, Krista Thomason notes that negative emotions including shame exist because they are functional, and that human beings are not perfect.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|loc=Conclusion}}\n\n=== Protests ===\n{{main article|Nudity and protest}}\n[[File:WNBR London 2012.jpg|thumb|left|People taking part in the [[World Naked Bike Ride]] in London]]\nNudity is used to draw public and attention to a cause, sometimes including the promotion of public nudity itself.{{sfn|Alaimo|2010}}\n\nParticular issues represented include animal rights by the group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], environmental issues by the [[World Naked Bike Ride]], women's rights by the organization [[Femen|FEMEN]].\n\n===Sexuality===\n{{main|Nudity and sexuality}}\n{{also|Sexual attraction|Physical attractiveness}}\n\nPersons who practice and advocate personal and social nudity distinguish between ''sexual'' and ''non-sexual'' nudity. Studies of naturism find that its practitioners adopt behaviors and norms that suppress the sexual responses while practicing social nudity.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009|pp=439\u2013446}} Such norms include refraining from staring, touching, or otherwise calling attention to the body while naked.{{sfn|Smith|1980|pp=223\u2013241}} However, some naturists do not maintain this non-sexual atmosphere, as when nudist resorts host sexually oriented events.{{sfn|Silver|1991}}\n\n==Modern social practices==\nNorms related to nudity are associated with norms regarding [[personal freedom]], [[human sexuality]], and [[gender role]]s, which vary widely among modern societies. Situations where nudity is accepted vary. Some people practice nudism within the confines of \"[[nudist camp]]s\" or clothing-optional resorts, while naturists seek more open acceptance of nudity in everyday life and in public spaces.{{sfn|Cooper|2011|pp=326\u2013357}}\n\n===Baths and spas===\n{{also|Sauna}}\nBathing for cleanliness and recreation is a human universal found worldwide, and the communal use of bathing facilities has been maintained in many cultures from varying traditional sources. When there is complete nudity, the facilities are often segregated by sex, but not always.\n\nThe [[sauna]], originating from [[Finland]], is attended nude in its source country{{sfn|Daney|1998}} as well as in most Scandinavian countries and in the German-speaking countries of Europe.{{sfn|Scheuch|2004|pp=156-}} This is true even when a swimsuit must be worn in the swimming pool area of the same complex.{{sfn|Daney|1998}} The trend in some European countries (Germany, Finland and the [[Netherlands]], for instance) is to allow both genders to bathe together naked. For example, the Friedrichsbad in [[Baden-Baden]] has designated times when mixed nude bathing is permitted. Most German (not to mention French, Spanish and Greek) beaches and swimming pools offer [[Freik\u00f6rperkultur|FKK]] (clothing-optional) areas. The German sauna culture also became popular in neighbouring countries such as [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]].{{efn|{{lang|de|German text: \"Dass M\u00e4nner und Frauen zusammen splitternackt schwitzen, ist eine deutsche Spezialit\u00e4t, f\u00fcr die sich nur noch Urlauber aus den Benelux-Staaten, aus \u00d6sterreich und der Schweiz erw\u00e4rmen k\u00f6nnen, vielleicht auch noch Osteurop\u00e4er\".}}{{sfn|Kast|2014}} English translation: \"The fact that men and women sweat together stark naked is a German specialty that only tourists from the Benelux countries, Austria and Switzerland can warm to, maybe even Eastern Europeans\".}} In contrast to [[Scandinavia]], public sauna facilities in these countries\u2014while nude\u2014do not usually segregate genders.{{efn|{{lang|de|German text: \"In den Fitnesszentren und Kuranstalten wurde das finnische Bad, oft gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig ausgestaltet zu ganzen Saunalandschaften, zum selbstverst\u00e4ndlichen Angebot.

These normal activities are guided by generally accepted norms, the first of which is that the facilities are most often segregated by gender; however, this may not be the case in all cultures.<!--Summary of section content, no citations-->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0609-302, K\u00f6ritz, Duschraum des Kindergartens.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Kindergarten shower room in K\u00f6ritz, a district of [[Neustadt (Dosse)|Neustadt-Dosse]] (1987)]]\n\n[[Changing room|Changing rooms]] may be provided in stores, workplaces, or sports facilities to allow people to change their clothing. Some changing rooms have individual cubicles or stalls affording varying degrees of privacy. Locker rooms and communal showers associated with sports generally lacked any individual space, thus providing minimal physical privacy.\n\nThe men\u2019s locker room\u2014which historically in Western cultures had been a setting for open male social nudity\u2014is, in the 21st century United States, becoming a space of modesty and distancing between men. For much of the 20th century, the norm in locker rooms had been for men to undress completely without embarrassment. That norm has changed; in the 21st century, men typically wear towels or other garments in the locker room most of the time and avoid any interaction with others while naked. This shift is the result of changes in social norms regarding masculinity and how maleness is publicly expressed; also, open male nudity has become associated with homosexuality.{{sfn|Miller|2016}} In facilities such as the YMCA that cater to multiple generations, the young are uncomfortable sharing space with older people who do not cover up.{{sfn|Tosches|2012}} The behavior in women's locker rooms and showers also indicates a generational change, younger women covering more, and full nudity being brief and rare, while older women are more open and casual.{{sfn|Goldman|2007}}\n\nBy the 1990s, communal showers in American schools had become \"uncomfortable\", not only because students were accustomed to more privacy at home, but because young people became more self-conscious based upon the comparison to mass media images of perfect bodies.{{sfn|Johnson|1996}} In the 21st century, some high-end New York City gyms were redesigned to cater to [[millennial]]s who want to shower without ever being seen naked.{{sfn|Sicha|2015}} The trend for privacy is being extended to public schools, colleges and community facilities replacing \"gang showers\" and open locker rooms with individual stalls and changing rooms. The change also addresses issues of transgender usage and family use when one parent accompanies children of differing gender.{{sfn|Steinbach|2017}} \n\nThis shift in attitudes has come to societies historically open to nudity. In Denmark, secondary school students are now avoiding showering after gym classes. In interviews, students cited the lack of privacy, fears of being judged by idealized standards, and the possibility of being photographed while naked.{{sfn|Frydendal|Thing|2020}} Similar results were found in schools in Norway.{{sfn|Johansen|M\u00e6hle|\u00d8yvind|Haugen|2017}}\n\n====Social and public nudity====\n{{also|Nude recreation|Issues in social nudity}}\n[[File:Fremont Solstice Parade 2007 - naked couple 01.jpg|thumb|Nude people at Fremont Solstice Parade in Seattle, Washington, USA]]\nAttitudes toward public nudity vary depending on culture, time, location, and context. There are particular contexts in which nudity is tolerated, accepted, or even encouraged in [[public spaces]]. In Europe, such contexts include [[nude beach|nude beaches]], within some [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] (such as [[naturism|naturist]] resorts or clubs) and at special events.\n\nWhile some European countries (such as [[Germany]], for example) are rather tolerant of public nudity,<ref name=\"Spiegel2006\" /> other nations disfavor or punish public nudity. In the United States in 2012, the city council of [[San Francisco]], California banned public nudity in the inner-city area. This move was met by harsh resistance because the city was known for its liberal culture and had previously tolerated public nudity.{{sfn|Taub|2012}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2012}} Similarly, [[park ranger]]s began filing tickets against nudists at [[San Onofre State Beach]]\u2014also a place with long tradition of public nudity\u2014in 2010.{{sfn|Sisson|2010}}\n\n====Naturism====\n{{Main article|Naturism}}\n{{also|Christian naturism}}\n[[File:At the nudist beach.jpg|thumb|left|A group of naturists on a beach in [[Crimea]], 2008]]\n\nNaturism (or nudism) is a [[subculture]] advocating and defending private and public nudity as part of a simple, natural [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Nudism originated in opposition to the [[industrialization]] of Europe in the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Grinnell\"/> \n\nNaturists reject contemporary standards of modesty that discourage personal, family and social nudity. They instead seek to create a social environment where individuals feel comfortable being in the company of nude people and being seen nude, either by other naturists or by the general public.{{sfn|Hile|2004}}\n\nNudism spawned a proselytizing literature in the 1920s and 1930s. Nudism's other common name, naturism, signals its core contention that the naked body is natural and that modesty and shame are cultural impositions with deleterious effects on psychological, sexual, and social well-being. Early nudism was in dialogue with sexology and feminism in a critique of society and its future.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=63-65}} While Christian moralists tended to condemn nudism, other Christians argued for the purity of the nude body compared to the corruption of the scanty clothing of the era.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=65-66}} Its proponents believed that nudism could combat social inequality, including sexual inequality.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=67-68}} As a socially marginal practice based on the naturalness of nakedness, nudism has had a complicated relationship with sexuality and pro\u2010sex discourses.{{sfn|Barcan|2015}} \n\nThe social sciences until the middle of the 20th century often studied public nakedness, including naturism, in the context of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]] or criminality.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=4\u201310}} However, more recent studies find that naturism has positive effects on body image, self esteem and life satisfaction.{{sfn|West|2018|pp=677\u2013697}} The ''Encyclopedia of Social Deviance'' continues to have an entry on \"Nudism\",{{sfn|Black|2014}} but also defines \"Normal Deviance\" as violating social norms in a positive way, leading to social change.{{sfn|Hasha|Kalish|2014}}\n\n====Nude beaches====\n{{main|Nude beach}}\n{{also|Nude recreation|Nude swimming}}\nA nude beach, sometimes called a clothing-optional or free beach, is a [[beach]] where users are at liberty to be nude. Such beaches are usually on public lands. Nude beaches may be official (legally sanctioned), unofficial (tolerated by residents and law enforcement), or illegal but so isolated as to escape enforcement.\n\n==== Arts-related activities ====\nDistinct from the [[nudity#Depictions of nudity|nude artworks]] created, sessions where artists, both amateur and professional, work from live models are a social situation where nudity has a long tradition. The role of the model both as part of visual art education and in the creation of finished works has evolved since antiquity in Western societies and worldwide wherever western cultural practices in the visual arts have been adopted. At modern universities, art schools, and community groups \"[[Model (art)|art model]]\" is a job, one requirement of which is to pose \"undraped\" and motionless for minutes, hours (with breaks) or days as the artwork requires.{{sfn| Steinhart|2004}}\n\nPhotography of groups of nude people in public places has been done around the world with or without official cooperation. The gathering itself is proposed as performance art, while the resulting images become statements based upon the identities of people invited to participate by posing, and the location selected; urban, scenic landscapes, or sites of historical significance. The photographers state a variety of artistic, cultural, and political reasons for their work, while those being photographed may be professional models or unpaid volunteers attracted to the project for personal reasons.\n\n*[[Spencer Tunick]] has been photographing his \"installations\" since 1994, often in urban spaces but also in landscapes.

Any ambiguous image not easily fitting into one of these categories may be misinterpreted, leading to disputes.{{sfn|Eck|2001}} The nude in photography includes [[Nude photography|scientific, commercial]], [[Nude photography (art)|fine art]], and [[erotic photography]].{{sfn|Rasmus|2011}}\n\n===Indecency and obscenity===\nLimits of the depiction of nudity are based upon the legal definitions of indecency and [[obscenity]].\nIn 1973, the Supreme Court in ''[[Miller v. California]]'' established the three-tiered [[Miller test]] to determine what was obscene (and thus not protected) versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the First Amendment.{{sfn|Rasmus|2011}}\n\n[[Depictions of child nudity]] (or of children with nude adults) appear in [[work of art|works of art]] in various cultures and historical periods. These attitudes have changed over time and have become increasingly frowned upon,{{sfn|Higonnet|1998|p=}} especially in the case of photography.

In \"The Nude: a Study in Ideal Form\", Lord [[Kenneth Clark]] states that to be naked is to be deprived of clothes, and implies embarrassment and shame, while a nude, as a work of art, has no such connotations.{{sfn|Clark|1956|loc=chpt. 1}} This separation of the artistic form from the related social and cultural issues was largely unexamined by classical art historians, but became a focus of social and feminist critiques in the 1970s, when classical nudes of women were seen as symbolic of male objectification of female bodies.{{sfn|Berger|1972}}{{sfn|Mulvey|1975}} The debate over [[objectification]] has continued, recently energized by the #[[MeToo]] movement.{{sfn|Slenske|Langmuir|2018}}\n\n==Performance==\nNudity may be used as a part of live performances, such as dance, theater, [[Performance art#1960s|performance art]] and nude [[body painting]].<!--Summary of content below-->\n===Dance===\n[[Dance]], as a sequence of human movement, may be [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], [[Social dance|social]] or one of the [[performing arts]]. Partial or complete nudity is a feature of ceremonial dances in some tropical countries. However, some claim that modern practices may be used to promote \"ethnic tourism\" rather than to revive authentic traditions.{{sfn|Firenzi|2012}} In Western traditions, dance costumes have evolved towards providing more freedom of movement and revealing more of the body; complete nakedness is the culmination of this process.{{sfn|Sparshott|1995}} Modern choreographers consider nudity one of the possible \"costumes\" available for dance, some seeing nudity as expressing deeper human qualities through dance which works against the [[sexual objectification]] of the body in commercial culture.{{sfn|Cappelle|Whittenburg|2014}} While nudity in social dance is not common, events such as \"Naked Tango\" have been held in Germany.{{sfn|Nethers|2013}}\n\n===Theater===\nA well-known performance that included nudity was the Broadway musical [[Hair (musical)#Nude scene|Hair]] in 1968.{{sfn|Libbey|2018}} The New York Times printed a number of letters to the editor in 1969 with opinions ranging from actress [[June Havoc]] stating that nudity indicates that the producer has run out of ideas;

which a [[human]] is not wearing [[clothing]] or specifically is not covering the [[genitals]].<ref name=\"wikt\" /> In some societies, partial nudity is defined as not covering other parts of the body that are deemed to be sexual.\n\n'''Nakedness''', or the loss of body fur, was one of the physical characteristics that marked the evolution of anatomically modern humans from their [[hominini]] ancestors. For many thousands of years, humans wore no clothing, which continues to be the norm in some isolated indigenous societies in tropical climates. The widespread adoption of clothing only occurred as people migrated to other climates which required protection from the elements. As societies developed from being [[hunter-gatherer]]s to being agrarian, clothing became part of cultural evolution as individuals and groups became differentiated by status and class. In early civilizations such as Egypt, slaves, children, and others with lower status often continued to be naked.\n\nThe modern understanding of nudity is culturally complex due to different meanings given various states of undress in differing social situations. In any particular society, nudity is defined in relation to being properly dressed, not in relation to the specific body parts being exposed. For humans, nakedness and clothing are connected to many [[Culture|cultural categories]] such as [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[privacy]], [[social status]] and [[Morality|moral behavior]].{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|loc=Introduction}} Synonyms and euphemisms for nudity abound, including \"birthday suit\", \"in the altogether\" and \"in the buff\". \"In a [[state of nature]]\" is also used by philosophers to refer to the state of humans before the existence of organized societies.<ref name=\"Websters.nude\"/>\n\nIn [[Western world|Western societies]], there are two contradictory cultural traditions relating to nudity. The first comes from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who saw the naked body as the natural state and as essentially positive. The second is based upon the [[Abrahamic religions]], which have viewed being naked as shameful and essentially negative. The fundamental teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam prohibit public, and sometimes also private nudity. However, the interaction between the Greek classical and later traditions has resulted in Western ambivalence, with nudity representing both positive and negative meanings in individual psychology, in social life, and in depictions such as art.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=11\u201315}} In the late 19th century, organized groups of nudists or naturists emerged with the stated purpose of regaining a natural connection to the human body and nature, sometimes in private spaces but also in public.\n\nIn Africa, there is a sharp contrast between the attitude toward nudity in Islamic countries and the attitude toward nudity in certain [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan countries]] that never abandoned, or are reasserting, precolonial norms.\n\nIn Asia, the norms regarding public nudity are in keeping with the cultural values of social propriety and human dignity. Rather than being perceived as immoral or shameful, nakedness is perceived as a breach of [[etiquette]] and perhaps as an embarrassment. In China, [[Face (sociological concept)|saving face]] is a powerful social force. In Japan, proper behavior included a tradition of mixed gender public baths before Western contact began in the 19th century, and proper attire for farmers and other workers might be a loincloth for both men and women. In India, the conventions regarding proper dress do not apply to monks in some Hindu and Jain sects who reject clothing as worldly.\n\nSocieties use clothing (or the lack thereof) as a marker of social status. Generally, social norms regarding nudity are different for men than they are for women. It was not until the 17th century in Europe that the female breast became a part of the body that must be covered in public. It is only in the modern era that the nudity of children represented anything but innocence. Individuals may intentionally violate norms regarding nudity; those without power may use nudity as a form of protest, and those with power may impose nakedness on others as a form of punishment.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of nudity}}\n<!--Opening of main article and summary of what follows -->\nThe history of nudity involves social attitudes to nakedness of the human body in different cultures in history. The use of clothing is one of the changes that mark the end of the [[Neolithic]] and the beginning of civilization.\n=== Prehistory ===\n<!--Defined as period before recorded history-->\n==== Evolution of hairlessness ====\n{{main|Human evolution}}\nThe dissipation of body heat remains the most widely accepted evolutionary explanation for the loss of body hair in early members of the genus [[homo]], the surviving member of which is modern humans.{{sfn|Kushlan|1980}}{{sfn|Wheeler|1985}}{{sfn|Sutou|2012}} Less hair, and an increase in sweat glands, made it easier for their bodies to cool when they moved from shady [[forest]] to open [[savanna]]. This change in environment also resulted in a change in diet, from largely vegetarian to hunting. Pursuing game on the savanna also increased the need for regulation of body heat.{{sfn|Daley|2018}}  Anthropologist and palaeobiologist [[Nina Jablonski]] posits that the ability to dissipate excess body heat through [[Eccrine sweat gland|eccrine sweating]] helped make possible the dramatic enlargement of the brain, the most temperature-sensitive human organ.{{sfn|Jablonski|2012}} Thus the loss of fur was also a factor in further adaptions, both physical and behavioral, that differentiated humans from other primates. Some of these changes are thought to be the result of sexual selection, which was first proposed by Darwin in [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]. By selecting more hairless mates, humans accelerated changes initiated by natural selection. Sexual selection may also account for the remaining human hair in the pubic area and armpits, which are sites for pheromones, while hair on the head continued to provide protection from the sun.{{sfn|Wade|2003}}\n\nA divergent explanation of humans' relative hairlessness holds that ecroparasites (such as ticks) residing in fur became problematic as humans became hunters living in larger groups with a \"home base\". Nakedness would also make the lack of parasites apparent to prospective mates.{{sfn|Rantala|2007|pp=1\u20137}}\n\nThe last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees was only partially bipedal, often using their front legs for locomotion. Other primate mothers do not need to carry their young because there is fur for them to cling to, but the loss of fur encouraged full bipedalism, allowing the mothers to carry their babies with one or both hands. The combination of hairlessness and upright posture may also explain the enlargement of the female breasts as a sexual signal.{{sfn|Sutou|2012}}\n\nWith the loss of fur, darker, high-melanin skin evolved as a protection from ultraviolet radiation damage. As humans migrated outside of the tropics, varying degrees of depigmentation evolved in order to permit UVB-induced synthesis of previtamin D<sub>3</sub>.{{sfn|Jablonski|Chaplin|2000|pp=57\u2013106}}{{sfn|Jablonski|Chaplin|2017}}\n\n==== Origin of clothing ====\n{{main|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThe wearing of clothing is most likely a behavioral [[adaptation]] arising from the need for protection from the elements, including the sun (for depigmented human populations) and cold temperatures as humans migrated to colder regions. According to a 2010 study published in ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'', estimates of the origins of clothing are based upon a genetic analysis indicating that clothing lice diverged from head louse ancestors at some point in time between 83,000 years ago and 170,000 years ago; this information suggests that the use of clothing likely originated with anatomically modern humans in Africa prior to their migration to colder climates.{{sfn| Toups| Kitchen| Light| Reed| 2010| pp=29\u201332}} A 2017 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' estimated that anatomically modern humans evolved 260,000 to 350,000 years ago.{{sfn| Schlebusch| 2017}} \n\nThe complex garments needed for survival in extreme cold would have required invention of the tools for turning animal skins into clothes: scrapers for cleaning and smoothing, fine stone knives for cutting and bone needles for stitching.{{sfn|Gilligan|2010}} What is now called clothing may have originated along with other types of adornment, including [[jewelry]], [[body paint]], [[tattoo]]s, and other [[body modification]]s, \"dressing\" the naked body without concealing it.{{sfn|Hollander|1978|p=83}} According to Leary and Buttermore, body adornment is one of the changes that occurred in the late [[Paleolithic]] (40,000 to 60,000 years ago) in which humans became not only anatomically modern, but also [[Behavioral modernity|culturally and psychologically modern]] and capable of self-reflection and symbolic interaction.{{sfn|Leary|Buttermore|2003}}\n\n=== Ancient history ===\n<!--Defined as period from beginning of recorded history to the end of the classical period, about 3000 BCE to 500 CE. Preliterate societies, unless mentioned in written history (usually as savages and barbarians), are not part of history.-->\n[[File:Fetekti3c.jpg| thumb| left| 240px| Scenes painted on white plaster, Fifth Dynasty (approx. 2500\u20132300 BCE), [[Abusir]] necropolis, [[Egypt]]]]\nIn ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most people owned a single item of clothing, and being naked meant being at the bottom of the social scale, lacking in dignity and status.{{sfn|Batten|2010}}\n\nFor the average person, clothing changed little in [[ancient Egypt]] from the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]], (3150\u20132686 BCE) until the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (2055\u20131650 BCE). Although the genitals of adults were generally covered, nakedness in ancient Egypt was not a violation of any social norm, but more often a convention indicating wealth; those that could afford to do so covered more.{{sfn|Mertz|1990|p=75}} Both men and women wore skirts called ''schenti''\u2014which evolved from [[loincloth]]s and resembled modern kilts. Slaves and laborers were nude or wore loincloths. Only women of the upper classes wore  ''[[kalasiris]]'', a dress of loose draped or translucent linen which came from just above or below the breasts to the ankles.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} Women entertainers performed naked. Children went without clothing until [[puberty]], at about age 12.{{sfn|Altenm\u00fcller|1998|pp=406\u20137}} It was not until the later periods, in particular the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1550\u20131069 BCE), that functionaries in the households of the wealthy also began wearing more refined dress, and upper class women wore elaborate dresses and ornamentation which covered their breasts. These later styles are often shown in film and TV as representing ancient Egypt in all periods.{{sfn|Mark|2017}}\n\nMale nudity was celebrated in [[ancient Greece]] as in no culture before or since. They considered embarrassment at having to disrobe for sports a sign of barbarism.{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=57}} The female nude emerged as a subject for art in the 5th century BCE, illustrating stories of women bathing both indoors and outdoors. While depictions of nude women were erotic in nature, there was no attribution of impropriety as would be the case for such images in later Western culture. However, the passive images reflected the unequal status of women in society compared to the athletic and heroic images of naked men.{{sfn| Kosso| Scott| 2009| pp=61-86}}\n\nThe [[toga]] was essential to announce the status and rank of male [[Roman citizenship|citizens at Rome]].{{sfn|Habinek|Schiesaro|1997|p=39}} The poet [[Ennius]] (c. 239\u2013169&nbsp;BCE) declared, \"exposing naked bodies among citizens is the beginning of public disgrace\". [[Cicero]] endorsed Ennius' words.{{sfn|Cicero|1927|p=[https://www.loebclassics.com/view/marcus_tullius_cicero-tusculan_disputations/1927/pb_LCL141.409.xml 408]}} An exception was the Roman baths ([[thermae]]), which had many social functions.{{sfn|Fagan|2002}}\n[[File:Stamnos women bath Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2411.jpg| thumb| right| 180px| Three young women bathing. Side B from an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure [[stamnos]], 440\u2013430 BCE.]]\nClothing used in the Middle East, which loosely envelopes the entire body, changed little for centuries. In part, this consistency arises from the fact that such clothing is well-suited for the climate (protecting the body from [[dust storm]]s while also allowing cooling by evaporation).<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> The meaning of the naked body in the societies based upon the [[Abrahamic religions]] ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]) was defined by a creation narrative in which [[Adam and Eve]], the [[Protoplast (religion)|first]] [[Adam|man]] and [[Eve|woman]], were naked and unashamed until they ate the [[forbidden fruit]] of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]]. The philosophical meaning of this myth in terms of stating the source of shame is unclear. The \"[[original sin]]\" did not involve nakedness, but disobedience, yet the first response was to cover their bodies with fig leaves.{{sfn|Velleman|2001}} In all three religions, modesty generally prevails in public, with clothing covering all parts of the body of a sexual nature. The [[Torah]] set forth laws regarding clothing and modesty (''[[tzniut]]'') which also separated Jews from other people in the societies they lived within.{{sfn|Silverman|2013}} \n\nEarly Christians generally inherited the norms of dress from Jewish traditions. However, the [[Adamites]] were an obscure Christian sect in [[North Africa]] originating in the second century who worshiped in the nude, professing to have regained the innocence of Adam.{{sfn|Livingstone|2013}} [[Islamic clothing]] for both men and women is in accordance with the rules of [[hajib]]. For men, clothing covers the area from the waist to the knees. For women, clothing covers the area from the neck to the ankles and also covers the hair. The practice known as [[veil]]ing of women in public predates Islam in [[Iran|Persia]], [[Assyria|Syria]], and [[Anatolia]]. The [[Qur\u02be\u0101n]] provides guidance on the dress of women, but not strict rulings;<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> such rulings may be found in the [[Hadith]]. Originally, veiling applied only to the wives of [[Muhammad]]; however, veiling was adopted by all upper-class women after his death and became a symbol of [[Muslim]] identity.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2013}}\n\nIn stories written in [[Zhou dynasty|China]] as early as the fourth century BCE, nudity is presented as an affront to [[human dignity]], reflecting the belief that \"humanness\" in Chinese society is not innate, but is earned by correct behavior. However, nakedness could also be used by an individual to express contempt for others in their presence. In other stories, the nudity of women, emanating the power of ''[[Yin and yang|yin]]'', could nullify the ''yang'' of aggressive forces.{{sfn|Henry|1999|pp=475\u2013486}} Nudity in mixed-gender public baths was common in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] before the effects of Western influence, which began in the 19th century and became extensive during the [[Occupation of Japan|American occupation]] after [[World War II]]. The practice continues at a dwindling number of hot springs (''konyoku'') outside of urban areas.{{sfn|Hadfield|2016}} Another Japanese tradition was the women [[free-diver]]s (''[[Ama (diving)|ama]]'') who for 2,000 years until the 1960s collected seaweed and shellfish wearing only loincloths. Their nakedness was not shocking, since women farmers often worked bare-breasted during the summer.{{sfn|Martinez|1995}}\n\n=== Post-classical history ===\nThe late fourth century CE was a period of both of Christian conversion and standardization of church teachings, in particular on matters of sex. Sex outside marriage with a respectable woman injured third parties; her husband, father, and male relatives. Fornication with an unattached woman, likely a prostitute, courtesan or slave, was a lesser sin since it had no male victims, which in a patriarchal society might mean no victim at all.{{sfn|Harper|2012}} The dress or nakedness of women that were not deemed respectable was also of lesser importance.{{sfn|Glancy|2015}}\n\nThe period between the ancient and modern world\u2014approximately 500 to 1450 CE\u2014saw an increasingly stratified society in Europe. At the beginning of the period, everyone other that the upper classes lived in close quarters and did not have the modern sensitivity to private nudity, but slept and bathed together naked with innocence rather than shame. The Roman baths in [[Bath, Somerset]], were rebuilt, and used by both sexes without garments until the 15th century.{{sfn|Byrde|2018}} Sects with beliefs similar to the Adamites, who worshiped naked, emerged in the early 15th century.{{sfn|Lerner|1972}} Later in the period, with the emergence of a middle class, clothing in the form of fashion was a significant indicator of [[social|class]], and thus its lack became a greater source of [[embarrassment]].{{sfn|Classen|2008}}\n\n[[File:Jan Gossaert - Virgin and Child - WGA9771.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Virgin and Child (c. 1530) by [[Jan Gossaert]] ]]\nUntil the beginning of the eighth century, Christians were [[Baptism|baptized]] naked to represent that they emerged from baptism without sin.{{snf|Veyne|1987|p=455}} Although there is a common misconception that Europeans did not bathe in the [[Middle Ages]], public bath houses\u2014usually segregated by sex\u2014were popular until the 16th century, when concern for the spread of disease closed many of them.<ref name=\"Medievalists\" /> In Christian Europe, the parts of the body that were required to be covered in public did not always include the female breasts. In 1350, breasts were associated with nourishment and loving care, but by 1750, artistic representations of the breast were either erotic or medical. This eroticization of the breast coincided with the persecution of women as witches.{{sfn|Miles|Lyon|2008}}\n\nIn the medieval period, Islamic norms became more patriarchal, and very concerned with the chastity of women before marriage and fidelity afterward. Women were not only veiled, but segregated from society, with no contact with men not of close kinship, the presence of whom defined the difference between public and private spaces.{{sfn|Lindsay|2005|p=173}} Of particular concern for both Islam and early Christians, as they extended their control over countries that had previously been part of the Byzantine or Roman empires, was the local custom of public bathing. While Christians were mainly concerned about mixed-gender bathing, which was not uncommon, Islam prohibited nudity for women in the company of non-Muslim women.{{sfn| Kosso| Scott| 2009| pp=171-190}}\n\n=== Modern history ===\n==== Early modern ====\n<!-- About 1500 to 1850, aka the Age of Discovery and Colonialism -->\nThe association of nakedness with shame and anxiety became ambivalent during the [[Renaissance]]. The rediscovered art and writings of [[ancient Greece]] offered an alternative tradition of nudity as symbolic of innocence and purity  which could be understood in terms of the state of man \"[[Fall of man|before the fall]]\". Subsequently, norms and behaviors surrounding nudity in life and in works of art diverged during the modern history of individual societies.{{snf|Barcan|2004a|loc=chpt. 2}}\n\nDue to concerns about the spread of disease, many European public bath houses closed in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Medievalists\" /> By 1750, European artistic representations of the female breast were either erotic or medical.{{sfn|Miles|Lyon|2008}}\n\nThe age of [[colonialism]] was marked by frequent encounters between Christian and Muslim cultures and indigenous peoples of the tropics ([[Nudity#Tropical cultures|see below]]), leading to the [[stereotype]] of the \"naked savage\".{{sfn|Stevens|2003|pp=124\u2013140}}\n\nIn England during the 17th to 19th centuries, the clothing of the poor by Christian charity did not extend to those confined to \"madhouses\" such as [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]], where the inmates were often kept naked and treated harshly.{{sfn|Andrews|2007|pp=131\u2013156}}\n\nThe [[Victorian Era#Morality|Victorian Era]] is often considered to be entirely restrictive of nudity. However, throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century, workers in [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|coal]] [[Coal mining|mine]]s were naked due to the heat and the narrow tunnels that would catch on clothing. Men and boys worked fully naked, while women and girls (usually employed as \"[[Hurrying|hurriers]]\") would generally only strip to the waist (in some locations, they were fully naked as well). Testimony before a Parliamentary labour commission revealed that working naked in confined spaces made \"sexual vices\" a \"common occurrence\".<ref name=\"FordhamU\"/>\n\n==== Late modern ====\nPublic swimming pools in the U.S. were the product of municipal reform movements beginning in the mid-19th century. Civic leaders had not intended pools to be used for recreation, but for health and sporting activities, which were male only. Initially, working class men and boys swam in the nude, as had previously been customary in lakes and rivers.{{sfn|Wiltse|2003}} Communal male nudity in the [[United States]] and other Western countries was not a taboo for much of the 20th century.<ref name=\"HistoricArchive\"/> Males have been more likely than females to be expected to swim nude in swimming pools or to share communal showers in school locker rooms with other members of the same sex.{{sfn|Smithers|1999}} These expectations were based on cultural beliefs that females need more privacy than males do.{{sfn|Senelick|2014}} A 1963 article on a swim program in [[Troy, New York]] stated that boys swam nude, but that girls were expected to wear bathing suits; the writer of the article found nothing remarkable about these requirements.{{sfn|Mann|1963}} The era of nude swimming by boys in municipal pools ended when mixed-gender bathing was allowed.{{sfn|Wiltse|2003}}\n\nIn 1974, an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted an increase in American tolerance for nudity, both at home and in public, approaching that of Europe. However, some traditional nudists at the time decried the trend as encouraging sexual exhibitionism and voyeurism and threatening the viability of private nudist clubs.{{sfn|Sterba|1974}}\n\n=== Traditional cultures ===\nIn tropical regions worldwide complete or near nudity was common for both men and women before contact with [[Western culture]]s or [[Islam]].

The report asserted that children have a natural curiosity about their own bodies and the bodies of others that ought to be addressed in an age-appropriate manner. According to the report:\n*Children less than four years old will normally touch their own private parts, look at the private parts of others, and remove their clothes wanting to be naked;\n*Between ages four and six, children will be more actively curious. They will attempt to see others dressing or undressing, or will perhaps \"[[playing doctor|play doctor]]\"; and\n*Between ages six and twelve, children will expand their curiosity to images of undressed people available in the media. They will develop a need for privacy regarding their own bodies and begin to be sexually attracted to peers.\nThe report recommended that parents learn what is normal in regard to nudity and sexuality at each stage of a child's development and refrain from overreacting to their children's nudity-related behaviors unless there are signs of a problem (e.g. anxiety, aggression, or sexual interactions between children not of the same age or stage of development).<ref name=\"NTCSN.2009\"/>\n\nThe naturist/nudist point of view is that children are \"nudists at heart\" and that naturism provides the ideal environment for healthy development. It is noted that modern psychology generally agrees that children can benefit from an open environment where the bodies of others their own age of both sexes are not a mystery. However, there is less agreement regarding children and adults being nude. While some doctors have taken the view that some exposure of children to adult nudity (particularly parental nudity) may be healthy, others\u2014notably [[Benjamin Spock]]\u2014disagreed. Spock's view was later attributed to the lingering effect of [[Freudianism]] on the medical profession.{{sfn|Shantz|2017}}\n\n{{anchor|Nudity and children}}\nIn their 1986 study on the effects of social nudity on children, Smith and Sparks concluded that \"the viewing of the unclothed body, far from being destructive to the psyche, seems to be either benign or to actually provide positive benefits to the individuals involved.{{sfn|Smith|Sparks|1986|p=183}} In 1995, Gordon and Schroeder contended that \"there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them\", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They noted that by ages five to six, children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommended to parents who desire to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they respect a child's modesty from that age onwards.{{sfn|Gordon|Schroeder|1995|p=16}} \n\nIn a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect.{{sfn|Okami|1995|pp=51\u201364}} Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.{{sfn|Okami|Olmstead|Abramson|Pendleton|1998|pp=361\u2013384}} \n\nIn 1999, psychologist Barbara Bonner recommended against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic.{{sfn|Bonner|1999|p=211}} In 2019, psychiatrist Lea Lis recommended that parents allow nudity as a natural part of family life when children are very young, but to respect the modesty that is likely to emerge with puberty.{{sfn|Lis|2019}}\n{{Gallery\n| title        = Cultural differences in childhood nudity\n| align        =\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| height       = 180\n| width        =\n| captionstyle =\n| File:Recreational swim in the Greenbrier river for campers, who are children of miners.

The Culture Minister defended the book's being available for parents, and supported libraries that were under attack.{{sfn|Marosevic|2014}}\n\nAs part of a science program on Norwegian public television ([[NRK]]), a series on [[puberty]] intended for 8\u201312 year olds includes explicit information and images of reproduction, anatomy, and the changes that are normal with the approach of puberty. Rather than diagrams or photos, the videos are shot in a locker room with live nude people of all ages. The presenter, a physician, is relaxed about close examination and touching of relevant body parts, including genitals. While the videos note that the age of consent in Norway is 16, abstinence is not emphasized. In a subsequent series for teens and young adults, real people were recruited to have sex on tv as counterbalance to the unrealistic presentations in advertising and porn.<ref name=\"CultureTrip.2017\"/>\n\nAs of 2015, however, 37 U.S. states required that sex education curricula include lessons on abstinence and 25 required that a \u201cjust say no\u201d approach be stressed. Studies show that early and complete sex education does not increase the likelihood of becoming sexually active, but leads to better health outcomes overall.{{snf|Zadrozny|2015}} The Netherlands also has open and comprehensive sex education beginning as early as age 4, which similar health outcomes, in addition to promoting social benefits such as gender equality. Young children often play outdoors or in public wading pools nude.{{sfn|Rough|2018}}\n\nIn a 2018 survey of predominantly white middle-class college students in the United States, only 9.98% of women and 7.04% of men reported seeing real people (either adults or other children) as their first childhood experience of nudity. Many were accidental (walking in on someone) and were more likely to be remembered as negative by women. Only 4.72% of women and 2% of men reported seeing nude images as part of sex education. 83.59% of women and 89.45% of men reported that their first image of nudity was in film, video, or other mass media.{{sfn|Allen| Gary| Lavender-Stott| Kaestle|2018}}\n\n====High and low context cultures====\n{{also| Naturism in Germany| Naturism in France}}\nHigh and low context cultures were defined by [[Edward T. Hall]]. The behaviors and norms of a high context culture depend upon shared implicit intuitions that operate within a social situation, while in a low context culture behavior is more dependent upon explicit communications.{{sfn|Hall|1989}} An example of this distinction was found in research on the behavior of French and German naturists on a nude beach. Germans are extremely low in cultural context. They are characterized by individualism, alienation, estrangement from other people, little body contact, low sensitivity to nonverbal cues, and segmentation of time and space. By contrast, the French, in their personal lives are relatively high context: they interact within closely knit groups, are sensitive to nonverbal cues, and engage in relatively high amounts of body contact. To maintain public propriety on a nude beach, German naturists avoided touching themselves and others and avoid any adornments or behaviors that would call attention to the body. French naturists, on the other hand, were more likely than Germans to wear make-up and jewelry and to touch others as they would while dressed.{{sfn|Smith|1980}}\n\n====Concepts of privacy====\nSocieties in [[continental Europe]] conceive of privacy as protecting a right to respect and personal dignity. In America, the right to privacy is oriented toward values of liberty, especially in one's home. While Europeans maintain their dignity, even while naked where others may see them, Americans see public nakedness as a surrender of \"any reasonable [[expectation of privacy]]\". Such cultural differences may make some laws and behaviors of other societies seem incomprehensible.{{sfn|Whitman|2004|p=9}}\n\n==== Gender differences ====\n{{also|Sex differences in humans|Breast#Society and culture}}\nIn Western cultures, shame can result from not living up to the ideals of society with regard to physical appearance. Historically, such shame has affected women more than men. With regard to their naked bodies, the result is a tendency towards self-criticism by women, while men are less concerned by the evaluation of others.{{sfn|Weinberg|Williams|2010}}\n\n[[File:3 Topless Females Sunbathing on a Beach.JPG|thumb|left|In many European counties women may sunbathe without covering their breasts.]]\n\nIn much of the world, the modesty of women is a matter not only of social custom but of the legal definition of [[Indecent exposure#United States|indecent exposure]]. In the United States, the exposure of female nipples is a criminal offense in many states and is not usually allowed in public.{{sfn|Williams|2019}} \n\nThe \"[[topfreedom]]\" movement promotes equal rights for women to be naked above the waist in public on the same basis that would apply to men in the same circumstances.{{sfn|Jensen|2004}}\n\n[[Breastfeeding in public]] is forbidden in some [[jurisdiction]]s, not regulated in others, and protected as a legal right in public and the workplace in still others.

For example, imposed nudity (full or partial) can be part of a [[corporal punishment]] or as [[public humiliation|humiliation]], especially when administered in public.\n\nFor example, in 2017, students at a girls' school in the north-east Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] were forced to undress as a form of punishment, police say. Although not as common as [[corporal punishment]], it is not unusual for stripping to be used as a form of punishment in Indian schools.<ref name=\"BBC.2017\"/>\n====Torture====\n[[File:Abu-ghraib-leash.jpg|thumb|180px|One of the iconic photographs of the [[Abu Ghraib]] prison torture scandal: a naked prisoner being forced to crawl and bark like a dog on a leash. ]]\n\n[[Nazism|Nazis]] used forced nudity to attempt to humiliate inmates in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].

This was the case in 2006, when three young men who had been skinny-dipping outside [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] decided to go into town to see what would happen if they disrobed there. They were not arrested, and the following two summers saw a number of incidents of public nakedness until an ordinance banning nudity was passed.{{sfn|Anand|2008}}\n\nIn the 21st century [[United States]], the legal definition of \"full nudity\" is exposure of the genitals. \"Partial nudity\" includes exposure of the [[buttocks]] by either sex or exposure of the female [[breast]]s.<ref name=\"LawInsider\" /> Legal definitions are further complicated by laws regarding [[indecent exposure]]; this term generally refers to engaging in public nudity with an intent to offend common decency.<ref name=\"Websters\"/> Lewd and indecent behavior is usually defined as causing alarm, discomfort, or annoyance for the average person. Where the law has been challenged by asserting that nudity by itself in not lewd or disorderly, laws have been amended to specify indecent exposure, usually of the genitals but not always of the breast. Public indecency in generally a [[misdemeanor]], but may become a [[felony]] upon repeated offense or always if done in the presence of a minor.{{sfn|Posner|Silbaugh|1996|loc=chpt. 6}} In the State of Oregon, public nudity is legal and protected as free speech as long as there is not an \"intent to arouse\".{{sfn|Hale|2015}} At the other extreme, the State of Arkansas not only outlaws private nudism, but bans anyone from advocating the practice.{{sfn|Posner|Silbaugh|1996|p=85}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, nudity may not be used to \"harass, alarm or distress\" according to the Public Order Act of 1986.{{sfn|Arfin|2019}} According to a police spokesperson in 2013, nudity per se is not unlawful in the United Kingdom; however, the circumstances surrounding particular episodes of nudity may create public order offenses. Most naturists comply with the law by being nude only where others cannot see them.<ref name=\"BBC.2013\"/> After repeated arrests, prosecutions, and convictions in Great Britain, the activist [[Stephen Gough]] sued at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for the right to be nude in public outside of designated areas.

The ritual \"disrobing\" is done in the context of a performance which earns a payment, even though it is only symbolic (glass beads). Although the majority of those performing continue to be women, men (both homosexual and heterosexual) now also participate.{{sfn|Shrum|Kilburn|1996}}\n* [[Mooning]] refers to exposure of the buttocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2012/06/mooning-a-history-when-did-people-start-baring-their-butts-as-an-insult.html|title=When Did People Start Mooning Each Other?|first=Forrest|last=Wickman|date=27 June 2012|website=Slate Magazine}}</ref>  Mooning opponents in sports or in battle as an insult may have a history going back to ancient Rome.{{sfn|Wickman|2012}}\n* [[Streaking]] refers to running nude through a public area for publicity, as a [[prank]], as a dare, or as a form of [[protest]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/stripped-of-inhibitions-486277171.html|title=Jun 2018: Streakers make some events memorable for wrong reasons|first=Doug|last=Speirs|date=23 June 2018|via=www.winnipegfreepress.com|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press}}</ref>\n\n===Morality===\n{{also|Nudity in religion}}\n[[Shame]] is one of the [[moral emotions]] often associated with nudity. While [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] is the emotion experienced in response to a particular wrong action, shame is a more general and long-lasting self-assessment.{{sfn|Uebel|2019}} Shame is often thought of as positive in response to a failure to act in accordance with moral values, thus motivating an individual to do better in the future. However, shame is often negative as the response to perceived failures to live up to unrealistic expectations. The shame regarding nudity is one of the classic examples of the emotion, yet rather than being a positive motivator, it is considered unhealthy, standing in the way of developing a positive self-image.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|loc=chpt. 1}} Others argue that the shame felt when naked in public is due to valuing modesty and privacy as socially positive.{{sfn| Deonna| Rodogno| Teroni| 2012}} However, the response to such public exposure of normally private behavior is called embarrassment (like guilt, also a short-term emotion), rather than shame.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|p=11}}\n\nThe moral ambiguity of nudity is reflected in its many meanings, often expressed in the [[Conceptual metaphor| metaphors]] used to describe cultural values, both positive and negative.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=77\u201383}} \n\nOne of the first\u2014but now obsolete\u2014meanings of ''nude'' in the 16th century was \"mere, plain, open, explicit\" reflected in the modern metaphors \"the naked truth\", \"the bare facts\". Naturists often speak of their nakedness in terms of a return to the innocence and simplicity of childhood. The term naturism is based upon nakedness as being connected to nature in a positive way; which includes [[egalitarianism]], that all humans are alike in their nakedness. Nudity also represents freedom; the liberation of the body is associated with sexual liberation, although many naturists tend to downplay this connection. In some forms of [[Nude psychotherapy|group psychotherapy]], nudity has been used to promote open interaction and communication. Religious persons who reject the world as it is including all possessions may practice nudism, or use nakedness as a protest against an unjust world.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=83\u2013106}}\n\nMany of the negative associations are the inverse of positive ones. If nudity is truth, nakedness may be an invasion of privacy or the exposure of uncomfortable truths, a source of anxiety. The strong connection of nudity to sex produces shame when naked in contexts where sexuality is deemed inappropriate. Rather than being natural, nakedness is associated with savagery, poverty, criminality, and death. To be deprived of clothes is punishment; humiliating and degrading.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=106\u2013138}}\n\nConfronted with this ambiguity, some individuals seek to resolve it by working toward greater acceptance of nudity for themselves and others. The majority of naturists go through stages during which they gradually learn a new set of values regarding the human body.{{sfn|G\u00f3rnicka|2016|}} However, Krista Thomason notes that negative emotions including shame exist because they are functional, and that human beings are not perfect.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|loc=Conclusion}}\n\n=== Protests ===\n{{main article|Nudity and protest}}\n[[File:WNBR London 2012.jpg|thumb|left|People taking part in the [[World Naked Bike Ride]] in London]]\nNudity is used to draw public and attention to a cause, sometimes including the promotion of public nudity itself.{{sfn|Alaimo|2010}}\n\nParticular issues represented include animal rights by the group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], environmental issues by the [[World Naked Bike Ride]], women's rights by the organization [[Femen|FEMEN]].\n\n===Sexuality===\n{{main|Nudity and sexuality}}\n{{also|Sexual attraction|Physical attractiveness}}\n\nPersons who practice and advocate personal and social nudity distinguish between ''sexual'' and ''non-sexual'' nudity. Studies of naturism find that its practitioners adopt behaviors and norms that suppress the sexual responses while practicing social nudity.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009|pp=439\u2013446}} Such norms include refraining from staring, touching, or otherwise calling attention to the body while naked.{{sfn|Smith|1980|pp=223\u2013241}} However, some naturists do not maintain this non-sexual atmosphere, as when nudist resorts host sexually oriented events.{{sfn|Silver|1991}}\n\n==Modern social practices==\nNorms related to nudity are associated with norms regarding [[personal freedom]], [[human sexuality]], and [[gender role]]s, which vary widely among modern societies. Situations where nudity is accepted vary. Some people practice nudism within the confines of \"[[nudist camp]]s\" or clothing-optional resorts, while naturists seek more open acceptance of nudity in everyday life and in public spaces.{{sfn|Cooper|2011|pp=326\u2013357}}\n\n===Baths and spas===\n{{also|Sauna}}\nBathing for cleanliness and recreation is a human universal found worldwide, and the communal use of bathing facilities has been maintained in many cultures from varying traditional sources. When there is complete nudity, the facilities are often segregated by sex, but not always.\n\nThe [[sauna]], originating from [[Finland]], is attended nude in its source country{{sfn|Daney|1998}} as well as in most Scandinavian countries and in the German-speaking countries of Europe.{{sfn|Scheuch|2004|pp=156-}} This is true even when a swimsuit must be worn in the swimming pool area of the same complex.{{sfn|Daney|1998}} The trend in some European countries (Germany, Finland and the [[Netherlands]], for instance) is to allow both genders to bathe together naked. For example, the Friedrichsbad in [[Baden-Baden]] has designated times when mixed nude bathing is permitted. Most German (not to mention French, Spanish and Greek) beaches and swimming pools offer [[Freik\u00f6rperkultur|FKK]] (clothing-optional) areas. The German sauna culture also became popular in neighbouring countries such as [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]].{{efn|{{lang|de|German text: \"Dass M\u00e4nner und Frauen zusammen splitternackt schwitzen, ist eine deutsche Spezialit\u00e4t, f\u00fcr die sich nur noch Urlauber aus den Benelux-Staaten, aus \u00d6sterreich und der Schweiz erw\u00e4rmen k\u00f6nnen, vielleicht auch noch Osteurop\u00e4er\".}}{{sfn|Kast|2014}} English translation: \"The fact that men and women sweat together stark naked is a German specialty that only tourists from the Benelux countries, Austria and Switzerland can warm to, maybe even Eastern Europeans\".}} In contrast to [[Scandinavia]], public sauna facilities in these countries\u2014while nude\u2014do not usually segregate genders.{{efn|{{lang|de|German text: \"In den Fitnesszentren und Kuranstalten wurde das finnische Bad, oft gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig ausgestaltet zu ganzen Saunalandschaften, zum selbstverst\u00e4ndlichen Angebot.

Sent\u014d were mixed gender (''konyoku'') until the arrival of Western influences,{{sfn|Hadfield|2016}} but became segregated by gender in cities.<ref name=\"Japan\"/> Nudity is required at Japanese hot spring resorts ([[Onsen]]).{{sfn|Sood|2012}} Some such resorts continue to be mixed gender, but the number of such resorts is declining as they cease to be supported by local communities.{{sfn|Hadfield|2016}}\n\nIn [[Korea]], bathhouses are known as [[Jjimjilbang]]. Such facilities may include mixed-sex sauna areas where clothing is worn, but bathing areas are gender segregated; nudity is required in those areas.{{sfn|Milner|2015}}{{sfn|Sood|2012}} Korean spas have opened in the United States, also gender separated except the bathing areas. In addition to the health benefits, a woman wrote in Psychology Today suggesting the social benefits for women and girls having real life experience of seeing the variety of real female bodies\u2014even more naked than at a beach\u2014as a counterbalance to the unrealistic nudity seen in popular media.{{sfn|Taylor|2012}}\n\nIn [[Russia]], public [[Banya (sauna)|banyas]] are clothing-optional and are usually gender-segregated.{{sfn|Sood|2012}}\n\n===Non-Western societies===\n[[File:Mru women working in Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Mru women working in [[Bangladesh]]]]\n====Indigenous traditions====\nIn India, priests of the [[Digambara]] (\"skyclad\") sect of [[Jainism]] and some [[Hindu]] [[Sadhus]] refrain from wearing clothing to symbolize their rejection of the material world.{{sfn|Dundas|2004}}{{sfn|Hartsuiker|2014}} In [[Bangladesh]], the [[Mru people (Mrucha)|Mru people]] have resisted centuries of Muslim and Christian pressure to cloth their nakedness as part of religious conversion.

For example, at highly attended [[Nguni stick-fighting|stick-fighting]] tournaments, well-exposed young men use the occasion to catch the eye of prospective brides.<ref name=\"omovalleytribaltours\" /> The revival of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] culture is asserted in the adoption of traditional dress\u2014young women wearing only beaded skirts and jewelry\u2014in the [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umkhosi Womhlanga (Reed Dance)]] by the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] and [[Swazi people|Swazi]].{{sfn|Nkosi|2013}} However, the authenticity and propriety of the paid performance of \"bare chested\" Zulu girls for international tourists is sometimes questioned.{{sfn|Naidu|2009}} \n\nIn [[Brazil]], the [[Yawalapiti]]\u2014an indigenous [[Xingu peoples|Xingu tribe]] in the [[Amazon Basin]]\u2014practice a funeral ritual known as [[Quarup]] to celebrate life, death and rebirth.

These normal activities are guided by generally accepted norms, the first of which is that the facilities are most often segregated by gender; however, this may not be the case in all cultures.<!--Summary of section content, no citations-->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0609-302, K\u00f6ritz, Duschraum des Kindergartens.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Kindergarten shower room in K\u00f6ritz, a district of [[Neustadt (Dosse)|Neustadt-Dosse]] (1987)]]\n\n[[Changing room|Changing rooms]] may be provided in stores, workplaces, or sports facilities to allow people to change their clothing. Some changing rooms have individual cubicles or stalls affording varying degrees of privacy. Locker rooms and communal showers associated with sports generally lacked any individual space, thus providing minimal physical privacy.\n\nThe men\u2019s locker room\u2014which historically in Western cultures had been a setting for open male social nudity\u2014is, in the 21st century United States, becoming a space of modesty and distancing between men. For much of the 20th century, the norm in locker rooms had been for men to undress completely without embarrassment. That norm has changed; in the 21st century, men typically wear towels or other garments in the locker room most of the time and avoid any interaction with others while naked. This shift is the result of changes in social norms regarding masculinity and how maleness is publicly expressed; also, open male nudity has become associated with homosexuality.{{sfn|Miller|2016}} In facilities such as the YMCA that cater to multiple generations, the young are uncomfortable sharing space with older people who do not cover up.{{sfn|Tosches|2012}} The behavior in women's locker rooms and showers also indicates a generational change, younger women covering more, and full nudity being brief and rare, while older women are more open and casual.{{sfn|Goldman|2007}}\n\nBy the 1990s, communal showers in American schools had become \"uncomfortable\", not only because students were accustomed to more privacy at home, but because young people became more self-conscious based upon the comparison to mass media images of perfect bodies.{{sfn|Johnson|1996}} In the 21st century, some high-end New York City gyms were redesigned to cater to [[millennial]]s who want to shower without ever being seen naked.{{sfn|Sicha|2015}} The trend for privacy is being extended to public schools, colleges and community facilities replacing \"gang showers\" and open locker rooms with individual stalls and changing rooms. The change also addresses issues of transgender usage and family use when one parent accompanies children of differing gender.{{sfn|Steinbach|2017}} \n\nThis shift in attitudes has come to societies historically open to nudity. In Denmark, secondary school students are now avoiding showering after gym classes. In interviews, students cited the lack of privacy, fears of being judged by idealized standards, and the possibility of being photographed while naked.{{sfn|Frydendal|Thing|2020}} Similar results were found in schools in Norway.{{sfn|Johansen|M\u00e6hle|\u00d8yvind|Haugen|2017}}\n\n====Social and public nudity====\n{{also|Nude recreation|Issues in social nudity}}\n[[File:Fremont Solstice Parade 2007 - naked couple 01.jpg|thumb|Nude people at Fremont Solstice Parade in Seattle, Washington, USA]]\nAttitudes toward public nudity vary depending on culture, time, location, and context. There are particular contexts in which nudity is tolerated, accepted, or even encouraged in [[public spaces]]. In Europe, such contexts include [[nude beach|nude beaches]], within some [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] (such as [[naturism|naturist]] resorts or clubs) and at special events.\n\nWhile some European countries (such as [[Germany]], for example) are rather tolerant of public nudity,<ref name=\"Spiegel2006\" /> other nations disfavor or punish public nudity. In the United States in 2012, the city council of [[San Francisco]], California banned public nudity in the inner-city area. This move was met by harsh resistance because the city was known for its liberal culture and had previously tolerated public nudity.{{sfn|Taub|2012}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2012}} Similarly, [[park ranger]]s began filing tickets against nudists at [[San Onofre State Beach]]\u2014also a place with long tradition of public nudity\u2014in 2010.{{sfn|Sisson|2010}}\n\n====Naturism====\n{{Main article|Naturism}}\n{{also|Christian naturism}}\n[[File:At the nudist beach.jpg|thumb|left|A group of naturists on a beach in [[Crimea]], 2008]]\n\nNaturism (or nudism) is a [[subculture]] advocating and defending private and public nudity as part of a simple, natural [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Nudism originated in opposition to the [[industrialization]] of Europe in the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Grinnell\"/> \n\nNaturists reject contemporary standards of modesty that discourage personal, family and social nudity. They instead seek to create a social environment where individuals feel comfortable being in the company of nude people and being seen nude, either by other naturists or by the general public.{{sfn|Hile|2004}}\n\nNudism spawned a proselytizing literature in the 1920s and 1930s. Nudism's other common name, naturism, signals its core contention that the naked body is natural and that modesty and shame are cultural impositions with deleterious effects on psychological, sexual, and social well-being. Early nudism was in dialogue with sexology and feminism in a critique of society and its future.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=63-65}} While Christian moralists tended to condemn nudism, other Christians argued for the purity of the nude body compared to the corruption of the scanty clothing of the era.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=65-66}} Its proponents believed that nudism could combat social inequality, including sexual inequality.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=67-68}} As a socially marginal practice based on the naturalness of nakedness, nudism has had a complicated relationship with sexuality and pro\u2010sex discourses.{{sfn|Barcan|2015}} \n\nThe social sciences until the middle of the 20th century often studied public nakedness, including naturism, in the context of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]] or criminality.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=4\u201310}} However, more recent studies find that naturism has positive effects on body image, self esteem and life satisfaction.{{sfn|West|2018|pp=677\u2013697}} The ''Encyclopedia of Social Deviance'' continues to have an entry on \"Nudism\",{{sfn|Black|2014}} but also defines \"Normal Deviance\" as violating social norms in a positive way, leading to social change.{{sfn|Hasha|Kalish|2014}}\n\n====Nude beaches====\n{{main|Nude beach}}\n{{also|Nude recreation|Nude swimming}}\nA nude beach, sometimes called a clothing-optional or free beach, is a [[beach]] where users are at liberty to be nude. Such beaches are usually on public lands. Nude beaches may be official (legally sanctioned), unofficial (tolerated by residents and law enforcement), or illegal but so isolated as to escape enforcement.\n\n==== Arts-related activities ====\nDistinct from the [[nudity#Depictions of nudity|nude artworks]] created, sessions where artists, both amateur and professional, work from live models are a social situation where nudity has a long tradition. The role of the model both as part of visual art education and in the creation of finished works has evolved since antiquity in Western societies and worldwide wherever western cultural practices in the visual arts have been adopted. At modern universities, art schools, and community groups \"[[Model (art)|art model]]\" is a job, one requirement of which is to pose \"undraped\" and motionless for minutes, hours (with breaks) or days as the artwork requires.{{sfn| Steinhart|2004}}\n\nPhotography of groups of nude people in public places has been done around the world with or without official cooperation. The gathering itself is proposed as performance art, while the resulting images become statements based upon the identities of people invited to participate by posing, and the location selected; urban, scenic landscapes, or sites of historical significance. The photographers state a variety of artistic, cultural, and political reasons for their work, while those being photographed may be professional models or unpaid volunteers attracted to the project for personal reasons.\n\n*[[Spencer Tunick]] has been photographing his \"installations\" since 1994, often in urban spaces but also in landscapes.

In \"The Nude: a Study in Ideal Form\", Lord [[Kenneth Clark]] states that to be naked is to be deprived of clothes, and implies embarrassment and shame, while a nude, as a work of art, has no such connotations.{{sfn|Clark|1956|loc=chpt. 1}} This separation of the artistic form from the related social and cultural issues was largely unexamined by classical art historians, but became a focus of social and feminist critiques in the 1970s, when classical nudes of women were seen as symbolic of male objectification of female bodies.{{sfn|Berger|1972}}{{sfn|Mulvey|1975}} The debate over [[objectification]] has continued, recently energized by the #[[MeToo]] movement.{{sfn|Slenske|Langmuir|2018}}\n\n==Performance==\nNudity may be used as a part of live performances, such as dance, theater, [[Performance art#1960s|performance art]] and nude [[body painting]].<!--Summary of content below-->\n===Dance===\n[[Dance]], as a sequence of human movement, may be [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], [[Social dance|social]] or one of the [[performing arts]]. Partial or complete nudity is a feature of ceremonial dances in some tropical countries. However, some claim that modern practices may be used to promote \"ethnic tourism\" rather than to revive authentic traditions.{{sfn|Firenzi|2012}} In Western traditions, dance costumes have evolved towards providing more freedom of movement and revealing more of the body; complete nakedness is the culmination of this process.{{sfn|Sparshott|1995}} Modern choreographers consider nudity one of the possible \"costumes\" available for dance, some seeing nudity as expressing deeper human qualities through dance which works against the [[sexual objectification]] of the body in commercial culture.{{sfn|Cappelle|Whittenburg|2014}} While nudity in social dance is not common, events such as \"Naked Tango\" have been held in Germany.{{sfn|Nethers|2013}}\n\n===Theater===\nA well-known performance that included nudity was the Broadway musical [[Hair (musical)#Nude scene|Hair]] in 1968.{{sfn|Libbey|2018}} The New York Times printed a number of letters to the editor in 1969 with opinions ranging from actress [[June Havoc]] stating that nudity indicates that the producer has run out of ideas;
