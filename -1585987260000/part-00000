Real Estate, cyberhomes, ''The New York Times'' and even [[eBay]]. The greater number of platforms owners list their properties, the greater the diffusion of information.<ref name=\"smallbusiness.chron.com\">http://smallbusiness.chron.com/advantages-disadvantages-advertising-internet-4029.html</ref> As buyers who are seeking for a piece of property, search engines are usually their first pit-stop. \"69% of home shoppers who take action on real estate brand website begin their research with a local term, i.e \"Houston homes for sale\" on a search engine\", reports Realtor.<ref name=\":0\" /> Once a potential buyer contacts the seller, they would go through the details of the property \u2013 sizing, amenities, condition, and pricing, if not stated. After which, an appointment for the viewing of the property would usually be scheduled and in some cases, potential buyers may request for a refurnish of certain amenities or parts of the property. If terms and conditions are met between both parties, the buyer would usually negotiate for the best offer if interested and a deposit may be requested by the owner. Finally, both parties will agree on a date for full payment, signing on official payment, and the handover of keys to the property.\n\n== Design ==\nGenerally, buyers are attracted to internet real estate due to its accessibility and its range of properties available.<ref name=\"smallbusiness.chron.com\"/>\n\n=== Advantages ===\n\n==== Convenience ====\nDue to [[distance decay]], personal commitments and time constraints, many turn to the web to carry out their daily activities \u2013 [[online shopping]], [[Internet booking engine|booking]] of tickets and even for communication between parties. Using the web to put out properties for sale and purchasing properties is no exception. The age of technology has aided in reducing time and money within internet real estate. Users may list their properties or search for them at their fingertips, reaching out to a greater number of people significantly, as compared to traditional methods. In contrast, the traditional methods of contacting and meeting up with a real estate agent cost more money (agent and transportation fees) and time.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/08/22/why-do-real-estate-agents-still-exist/</ref>\n\n==== Information load and reviews ====\nThe horizon of knowledge a real estate agent can be limited and fragmented. They may refer you to another branch if asked to compare the current property potential buyers are viewing to another property in a location elsewhere. Therefore, the internet allows for buyers to compare important aspects easily and successfully. With the array of properties listed, internet real estate provides buyers with the chance to conveniently compare the prices and location of the properties. Furthermore, buyers may use the method of filtering to narrow down their search for greater efficiency, where only properties that fall under their price range for example, would appear on the screen. The internet allows for different users to publish their reviews and feedbacks on properties which they may have lived in before, allowing current customers who are seeking for properties, a chance to review it with a wider perspective. This benefits customers greatly, as they do not solely adhere to possible biased opinions from the sellers and their pushy methods in getting them to seal the deal.\n\n==== Direct communications and transactions ====\nOne of the prime differences between traditional real estate and internet real estate is often, the absence of the middleman, known as a broker or a real estate agent. At times, real estate agents may be present, still dealing with customers directly from the web. Real estate agents often profit by absorbing a certain percentage of the final sale or rent price as commission. There are cases where commission percentage hits a figure of 6% in America.<ref>DARLIN, DAMON. 'The 6 Percent Solution: Skip Real Estate Agents'. Nytimes.com. N.p., 2005.

Some properties listed may be ambiguous and lack crucial details. Lack of full cost disclosure may be a huge issue if not stated accurately. As there is a lack of control on listings, inaccurate information of listings may be published. Sellers may publish misleading pictures of their properties, quote low pricing initially and state inexistent amenities available to attract and deceit potential buyers. Therefore, it is vital and up to buyers to identify issues and personnel that may be suspicious.\n\n==== Copyright ====\nWith the lack of control, marketing materials may be copied and published by any other person. The same flat in Kings Cross, London, may be listed multiple times, due to scams in hope for monetary transactions without actually owning the property listed. This causes the efficiency of the internet real estate to backfire instead, as buyers are muddled with the replicates of properties and would have to take additional time out to look for its actual owner.\n\n==== Target audience ====\nInternet real estate has unintentionally eliminated old-aged users and users without easy access to computers and the web. Technology is advancing at a rate of which the elder generations may not be able to keep up with. The convenience of viewing properties via the internet may therefore, exclude such communities. As stated, internet real estate is only accessible with the use of a computer, or a device which provides internet access. Hence, this concept forms a barrier against people who do not have access or face inconvenience when accessing such appliances.\n{{see also|digital divide}}\n\n==== Human interaction ====\nThe use of internet has in turn, reduced time between human interaction, which buyers do crave at times.<ref>http://uk.businessinsider.com/real-estate-agents-are-waging-a-war-against-the-internet-2015-2?r=US&IR=T</ref> Some people may feel uneasy when carrying out all actions through a computer screen as traditional methods of dealing with other parties in person have existed for too long of a period.\n\n== Incidents ==\nJust like any other operations, risks do exist when dealing with internet real estate. There has been cases where personal details and financial information were copied when [[cybercriminal]]s posed as sellers who listed their properties. Unfortunately, they published fake information of themselves and their properties and collected deposit and rent for a property which they had no ownership of.

The performance video was streamed on the project's independent label's website, To whom it may concern., on November 16, 2010, and released as a digital album on December 4, the same year, the project's one-year anniversary. For the project's seven-year anniversary in 2016,<ref name=\"trailer\"/> the film was made available for download and streaming,<ref name=\"vod\"/> and released on DVD on April 10, 2017.<ref name=\"twimc3\"/>\n\nThe one-hour performance takes place in a Swedish forest for the most part, with a single attendee chosen by followers to represent the audience.\n\n==Background and performance==\nTwo months since the release of \"y\", the seventh episode from the ''[[bounty (album)|bounty]]'' audiovisual series and album, a video requesting a volunteer was uploaded to iamamiwhomami's channel on October 1, 2010.<ref name=\"vogue\"/> This would be the first time the project addressed the audience directly, but not the first message the project delivered.<ref name=\"mtv-mail\"/> No official confirmation regarding who was behind the act, the internet's speculation already had name for the woman in the videos, Swedish singer-songwriter [[Jonna Lee (singer)|Jonna Lee]].<ref name=\"billboard\"/><ref name=\"telegraph\"/><ref name=\"mtv-jonna\"/>\nFollowing the cryptic nature of the project, the video instructed viewers to choose their representative by October 8, with full name, phone number, and address, with no explanation of the purpose.<ref name=\"yt20101001\"/> This resulted in fans choosing YouTube user ''tehhils'',<ref name=\"forsakenorder-20101001\"/> who couldn't travel at the time and decided to pass on the task to user ''ShootUpTheStation''. Subsequently, a video documenting a phone call made by Jonna Lee to the volunteer was uploaded on November 9, where she interviews him with questions about things like health, phobias, habits, and beliefs, ending with \"we will pick you up to the airport\" and requesting him to \"film [his] entire journey\".<ref name=\"yt20101109\"/> A series of six short videos from ShootUpTheStation's camera were uploaded from November 12 to 15, in which he documented his journey and his stay at a hotel where multiple visitors would come in to deliver a lesson.<ref name=\"volunteer-playlist\"/><ref name=\"jwz\"/>\n\nOn November 15, 2010, a concert was finally announced on a video titled \"http&#58;&#47;&#47;towhomitmayconcern.cc&#47;\",<ref name=\"yt-announcement\"/><ref name=\"vogue\"/> which would later become the label's website and store.\n\n==Release==\nThe concert video installation began streaming at approximately 00:15 CET on November 16, 2010, on the label's website, lasting 64 minutes and was available to be viewed for three additional hours on the site. The project went inactive after this, until it was released as a single-track album on digital stores and streaming platforms on December 4, 2010, coinciding with the audiovisual group's one-year anniversary. Along with the album release, singles for some songs from the performance were made available: \"b\", \"t\", \"n\", \"o\", \"u-2\", \"y\", and \".\" (pronounced \"{{lang|sv|[[wikt:punkt#Swedish|punkt]]}}\"; \"period\" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]).<ref name=\"gaynight-interview\"/>\nIn 2014, the album and its singles were pulled from all retailers.\n\nAgain, for the project's seventh anniversary on December 4, 2016, the film was released for download and on-demand streaming, and then a DVD edition came on April 10, 2017. These film digital and physical editions have a new artwork designed by Jacob Hulmston. The album has not been reissued on any format and remains unavailable.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline      = \n| total_length  = 1:04:10\n| all_lyrics    = Jonna Lee\n| all_music     = Jonna Lee and Claes Bj\u00f6rklund\n| title1        = ''IN CONCERT''\n| length1       = 64:10\n}}\n\n;Set list\nThe performance consist of the 7 ''bounty'' songs released in 2010, as well as the third ''[[bounty (album)|bounty]]'' prelude \u2014 which would later have a studio version released under the [[ionnalee]] project as \"LIKE HELL\" on ''[[Everyone Afraid to Be Forgotten|EVERYONE AFRAID TO BE FORGOTTEN]]''.

The performance video was streamed on the project's independent label's website, To whom it may concern., on November 16, 2010, and released as a digital album on December 4, the same year, the project's one-year anniversary. For the project's seven-year anniversary in 2016,<ref name=\"trailer\"/> the film was made available for download and streaming,<ref name=\"vod\"/> and released on DVD on April 10, 2017.<ref name=\"twimc3\"/>\n\nThe one-hour performance takes place in a Swedish forest for the most part, with a single attendee chosen by followers to represent the audience.\n\n==Background and performance==\nTwo months since the release of \"y\", the seventh episode from the ''[[bounty (album)|bounty]]'' audiovisual series and album, a video requesting a volunteer was uploaded to iamamiwhomami's channel on October 1, 2010.<ref name=\"vogue\"/> This would be the first time the project addressed the audience directly, but not the first message the project delivered.<ref name=\"mtv-mail\"/> No official confirmation regarding who was behind the act, the internet's speculation already had name for the woman in the videos, Swedish singer-songwriter [[Jonna Lee (singer)|Jonna Lee]].<ref name=\"billboard\"/><ref name=\"telegraph\"/><ref name=\"mtv-jonna\"/>\nFollowing the cryptic nature of the project, the video instructed viewers to choose their representative by October 8, with full name, phone number, and address, with no explanation of the purpose.<ref name=\"yt20101001\"/> This resulted in fans choosing YouTube user ''tehhils'',<ref name=\"forsakenorder-20101001\"/> who couldn't travel at the time and decided to pass on the task to user ''ShootUpTheStation''. Subsequently, a video documenting a phone call made by Jonna Lee to the volunteer was uploaded on November 9, where she interviews him with questions about things like health, phobias, habits, and beliefs, ending with \"we will pick you up to the airport\" and requesting him to \"film [his] entire journey\".<ref name=\"yt20101109\"/> A series of six short videos from ShootUpTheStation's camera were uploaded from November 12 to 15, in which he documented his journey and his stay at a hotel where multiple visitors would come in to deliver a lesson.<ref name=\"volunteer-playlist\"/><ref name=\"jwz\"/>\n\nOn November 15, 2010, a concert was finally announced on a video titled \"http&#58;&#47;&#47;towhomitmayconcern.cc&#47;\",<ref name=\"yt-announcement\"/><ref name=\"vogue\"/> which would later become the label's website and store.\n\n==Release==\nThe concert video installation began streaming at approximately 00:15 CET on November 16, 2010, on the label's website, lasting 64 minutes and was available to be viewed for three additional hours on the site. The project went inactive after this, until it was released as a single-track album on digital stores and streaming platforms on December 4, 2010, coinciding with the audiovisual group's one-year anniversary. Along with the album release, singles for some songs from the performance were made available: \"b\", \"t\", \"n\", \"o\", \"u-2\", \"y\", and \".\" (pronounced \"{{lang|sv|[[wikt:punkt#Swedish|punkt]]}}\"; \"period\" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]).<ref name=\"gaynight-interview\"/>\nIn 2014, the album and its singles were pulled from all retailers.\n\nAgain, for the project's seventh anniversary on December 4, 2016, the film was released for download and on-demand streaming, and then a DVD edition came on April 10, 2017. These film digital and physical editions have a new artwork designed by Jacob Hulmston. The album has not been reissued on any format and remains unavailable.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline      = \n| total_length  = 1:04:10\n| all_lyrics    = Jonna Lee\n| all_music     = Jonna Lee and Claes Bj\u00f6rklund\n| title1        = ''IN CONCERT''\n| length1       = 64:10\n}}\n\n;Set list\nThe performance consist of the 7 ''bounty'' songs released in 2010, as well as the third ''[[bounty (album)|bounty]]'' prelude \u2014 which would later have a studio version released under the [[ionnalee]] project as \"LIKE HELL\" on ''[[Everyone Afraid to Be Forgotten|EVERYONE AFRAID TO BE FORGOTTEN]]''.

So today, after listening to community feedback about the future of the platform, we're pleased to let you know that there won't be any immediate changes to Panoramio. Instead of aligning the community with Views, we've gone back to the drawing board to work on a more integrated solution that supports you and your content directly within [[Google Maps]]. We'll be taking the necessary time to get this right as we build a solution that strives to meet the majority of your needs.

Images judged to be too creative or artistic in concept, such as [[Photoshop]] constructions, were also excluded from [[Google Earth]] regardless of other requirements met.

Achieving this balance can be a challenge, especially when publishing tools are managed under separate products, such as Panoramio, Views, Google+ and Google Maps. So today, after listening to community feedback about the future of the platform, we're pleased to let you know that there won't be any immediate changes to Panoramio. Instead of aligning the community with Views, we've gone back to the drawing board to work on a more integrated solution that supports you and your content directly within [[Google Maps]]. We'll be taking the necessary time to get this right as we build a solution that strives to meet the majority of your needs. Thanks for your input, and for your patience in the year ahead\".''\n\nUsers noticed a decline in the site's performance, soon. Not only were photos no longer being loaded to Google Earth but daily view statistics were often not appearing.

It received over 1,500 supporters.\n\nOn October 5, 2016, Google informed Panoramio users that they had decided to move forward with closing down Panoramio on November 4, 2016. Users were able to access their photos in Panoramio for a year, but were unable to add new photos, likes, or comments. Users were told: ''\"Today, with photo upload tools in Google Maps and our Local Guides program, we are providing easy ways for you to share your photos with an active and growing community.

Thus it can be stated that Google's decision to close the site did nor reflect neither its popularity nor the wishes of its users. Google closed an active site in line with the company's policies and not in line with the will of more than 4 mln people.\n\n== Organization ==\n[[File:Panoramio - strona uzytkownika 656563.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sample Panoramio page (of user 656563) exemplifying some of the mashup's options.]]\nPanoramio asked users to organize images using [[Tag (metadata)|tags]] (a form of [[metadata (computing)|metadata]]), which allow searchers to find images concerning a certain topic such as [[Location (geography)|place name]] or subject matter. Panoramio was also an early website to implement [[tag cloud]]s, which provided access to images tagged with the most popular keywords. The website also hosted a list of world-famous sites. {{As of|2012|02}}, 1 million photos were uploaded to the site in about 20 days.<ref>{{cite web |author=Samaee |url=https://www.panoramio.com/photo/61090927 |title=Photo of Days to upload one Millions photos (61 M) |website=Panoramio |date=October 24, 2011 |access-date=February 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905053630/https://www.panoramio.com/photo/61090927 |archive-date=September 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nImages that had (or were perceived to have had) as their central subject people, machines, vehicles or anything within the interiors of structures, or depict public events such as fairs or concerts, were excluded from the Google Earth layer, as were any potentially controversial images. No waivers were granted even if the images were historical or otherwise vintage in nature, since copyright had to be held by the uploader. Images judged to be too creative or artistic in concept, such as [[Photoshop]] constructions, were also excluded from [[Google Earth]] regardless of other requirements met. However a pervasive problem was thousands of misplaced photos, typically manifested by cities and towns seemingly located in the oceans, which required action on the part of the photographer before anything could be done.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/panoramio-questions-support/WNVT8XM4KmA |title=Report misplaced pictures without new location information |date=May 24, 2010 |website=Google Groups |access-date=February 12, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nUsers could create and join [[Google Groups]].
