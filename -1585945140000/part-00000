{"title_page": "Frequency Exhibition", "text_new": "The '''Frequency Exhibition''' was a contemporary exhibition at the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] from November 9, 2005 - March 12, 2006. Curated by [[Thelma Golden]] and associate curator [[Christine Y. Kim]], the exhibition featured the works of 35 emerging Black artists. Frequency, following the 2001 exhibition \"[[Freestyle Exhibition|Freestyle]],\" is one of five \"F\" themed exhibitions alongside Flow, Fore, and Fictions. While curators Golden and Kim point out that Frequency was not \"Freestyle II,\" the organization of artists under the umbrella of Black identity engages with \"[[Post-black art|Post-Black]]\" art similarly to the Freestyle exhibition.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://frieze.com/article/frequency|title=Frequency|last=Gronlund|first=Melissa|work=Frieze|access-date=2019-11-12|issue=97|language=en|issn=0962-0672}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing Freestyle's success in 2001, Golden felt at first that the necessity of curating a show whose work featured emerging black artists was not as immediate.

Curated by [[Thelma Golden]] and associate curator [[Christine Y. Kim]], the exhibition featured the works of 35 emerging Black artists. Frequency, following the 2001 exhibition \"[[Freestyle Exhibition|Freestyle]],\" is one of five \"F\" themed exhibitions alongside Flow, Fore, and Fictions.
