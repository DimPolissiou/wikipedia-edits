It lasted for 20 seconds. During this time the south side of the [[Nojima Fault]] moved 1.5 meters to the right and 1.2 meters downwards. There were four [[foreshock]]s, beginning with the largest (Mj 3.7) at 18:28 on the previous day.{{clear}}\n\n===Intensity===\n[[File:USGS Shakemap - 1995 Kobe earthquake.jpg|thumb|USGS ShakeMap for the event]]\n\nIt was the first time that an earthquake in Japan was officially measured at a seismic intensity (''shindo'' in Japanese) of the highest Level 7 on the [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale|scale]] of [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA). After the earthquake, seismic intensity observation in Japan was fully mechanized (from April 1996) and JMA seismic intensity Levels 5 and 6 were each divided into 2 levels (from October 1996).\n\nAn on-the spot investigation by JMA concluded that tremors by this earthquake were at seismic intensity of Level 7 in particular areas in northern Awaji Island (now [[Awaji, Hy\u014dgo|Awaji City]]) and in the cities of [[Kobe]], [[Ashiya, Hy\u014dgo|Ashiya]], [[Nishinomiya, Hy\u014dgo|Nishinomiya]] and [[Takarazuka, Hy\u014dgo|Takarazuka]].<ref name=\"JMA-database\"/>\n\nTremors were valued at seismic intensity of Levels 4 to 6 at observation points in [[Kansai region|Kansai]], [[Ch\u016bgoku region|Ch\u016bgoku]], [[Shikoku]] and [[Ch\u016bbu region|Ch\u016bbu]] regions:<ref name=\"JMA-database\">[http://www.data.jma.go.jp/svd/eqdb/data/shindo/Event.php?ID=132682 Search result] on JMA database (in Japanese) of seismic intensity.</ref>\n* Level 6 in the cities of [[Sumoto, Hy\u014dgo|Sumoto]] (in Awaji Island) and Kobe (both in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture).\n* Level 5 in the cities of [[Toyooka, Hy\u014dgo|Toyooka]] (in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture), [[Hikone, Shiga|Hikone]] (in Shiga Prefecture) and [[Kyoto]].\n* Level 4 in the prefectures of [[Hy\u014dgo Prefecture|Hy\u014dgo]], [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]], [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]], [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]], [[Mie Prefecture|Mie]], [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]], [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]], [[Wakayama Prefecture|Wakayama]], [[Tottori Prefecture|Tottori]], [[Okayama Prefecture|Okayama]], [[Hiroshima Prefecture|Hiroshima]], [[Tokushima Prefecture|Tokushima]], [[Kagawa Prefecture|Kagawa]] and [[K\u014dchi Prefecture|K\u014dchi]].\n\n===Damage===\nDamage was extremely widespread and severe.

In addition, residents were afraid to return home because of aftershocks that lasted several days (74 of which were strong enough to be felt).\n\nThe majority of deaths, over 4,000, occurred in cities and suburbs in [[Hy\u014dgo Prefecture]].  A total of 68 children under the age of 18 were orphaned, while 332 additional children lost one parent.<ref>[[Kyodo News]], \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110402f2.html Hunt for tsunami orphans hampered, unprecedented]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', April 2, 2011, p. 4.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | image1 = Nojima fault top view.jpg\n | image2 = Port of Kobe Earthquake Memorial Park2.jpg\n | footer =  A section of the [[Nojima Fault]] (left) and preserved damage at the Earthquake Memorial Park near the port of Kobe\n }}\n\nOne in five of the buildings in the worst-hit areas were completely destroyed (or rendered uninhabitable). About 22% of the offices in Kobe's central business district were rendered unusable, and over half of the houses in that area were deemed unfit to live in. High rise buildings that were built after the modern 1981 building code suffered little; however, those that were not constructed to these standards suffered serious structural damage. Most of the older traditional houses had heavy tiled roofs which weighed around two tons, intended to resist the frequent typhoons that plagued Kobe, but they were only held up by a light wood support frame. When the wood supports gave way, the roof crushed the unreinforced walls and floors in a [[Progressive collapse|pancake collapse]]. Newer homes have reinforced walls and lighter roofs to avoid this, but are more susceptible to typhoons.\n\nThe damage to highways and subways was the most graphic image of the earthquake, and images of the collapsed elevated [[Kobe Route]] of the [[Hanshin Expressway]] made front pages of newspapers worldwide. Most people in Japan believed those structures to be relatively safe from earthquake damage because of the steel-reinforced concrete design. Although the initial belief was construction had been negligent, it was later shown that most of the collapsed structures were constructed properly according to the building codes in force in the 1960s. However, the steel-reinforcement specifications in the 1960s regulations had already been discovered to be inadequate and revised several times, the latest revision being in 1981, which proved effective but [[grandfather clause|only applied to new structures]].\n\n[[File:Hanshin-Awaji earthquake 1995 Kashiwai-building 001.jpg|thumb|180px|Immediately before the collapse of the Kashiwai building]]\n\nTen spans of the Kobe Route elevated expressway were knocked over in three locations across Kobe and Nishinomiya, blocking a link that carried forty percent of Osaka-Kobe road traffic. Half of the elevated expressway's piers were damaged in some way, and the entire route was not reopened until September 30, 1996. Three bridges on the less heavily used Route 2 were damaged, but the highway was reopened well ahead of Route 3 and served as one of the main intercity road links for a time. The [[Meishin Expressway]] was only lightly damaged, but was closed during the day until February 17, 1995 so that emergency vehicles could easily access the hardest-hit areas to the west. It wasn't until July 29 that all four lanes were open to traffic along one section.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kitamura|Yamamoto|Fujii|1998|p=240}}</ref> Many surface highways were clogged for some time due to the collapse of higher-capacity elevated highways.\n\nMost railways in the region were also damaged. In the aftermath of the earthquake, only 30% of the Osaka-Kobe railway tracks were operational. [[Daikai Station]] on the [[Kobe Rapid Railway]] line collapsed, bringing down part of [[Japan National Route 28|National Route 28]] above it. Wooden supports collapsed inside supposedly solid concrete pilings under the tracks of the [[Shinkansen]] high-speed rail line, causing the entire line to shut down. However, the railways rebounded quickly after the quake, reaching 80% operability in one month. The [[Kobe Municipal Subway]] resumed operation the day after the earthquake with limited service between {{STN|Seishin-Chuo}} and {{STN|Itayado}} stations (along with the [[Hokushin Kyuko Electric Railway]] between {{STN|Tanigami}} and {{STN|Shin-Kobe}}); service resumed across the entire line on February 16, 1995, with full service resuming a month later after repairs were completed. Trains continued to operate with speed restrictions until July 21, 1995.\n\nArtificial islands, such as the modern [[Rokk\u014d Island]] and especially [[Port Island]] in Kobe, suffered severe subsidence due to [[soil liquefaction|liquefaction]] of the soil; water breaking through the surface and flooding those islands was initially believed to have seeped in from the sea, but in fact rose from the liquefied remains of once-solid soils used to construct the islands. However, the newly completed artificial island supporting [[Kansai International Airport]] was not significantly affected, due to being further away from the epicenter and because it was built to the latest standards. The [[Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge]], under construction near the earthquake's epicenter, was not damaged but was reportedly lengthened by a full meter due to horizontal displacement along the activated tectonic fault.\n\n===Nomenclature===\nOutside Japan the earthquake is commonly known as the Kobe earthquake. In Japan, the disaster by this earthquake is officially called {{Nihongo4|The Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake Disaster|\u962a\u795e\u30fb\u6de1\u8def\u5927\u9707\u707d|Hanshin-Awaji Daishinsai}}, which is often shortened to {{Nihongo4|The Great Hanshin Earthquake Disaster|\u962a\u795e\u5927\u9707\u707d|Hanshin Daishinsai}}. ''Hanshin'' refers to the region between Osaka and Kobe. In the scientific literature it is often called the {{Nihongo4|1995 Southern Hy\u014dgo Prefecture Earthquake|\u5e73\u62107\u5e74(1995\u5e74)\u5175\u5eab\u770c\u5357\u90e8\u5730\u9707|Heisei 7 nen (1995 nen) Hy\u014dgo-ken Nanbu Jishin}}, the name chosen by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] in the week after the main shock.\n\n==Other aspects==\n[[File:Hanshin-Awaji earthquake 1995 337.jpg|thumb|Damage in Sannomiya]]\n\nThe quake ravaged many of the facilities of what was then the world's sixth-largest container port and the source of nearly 40% of Kobe's industrial output.<ref name=\"Economist1\">{{Cite journal|title=Economics Focus: The Cost of calamity|journal=The Economist|volume=398|issue=8725|page=68|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|date=March 19\u201325, 2011|url=http://www.economist.com}}</ref>\n\nThe sheer size of the earthquake caused a major decline in Japanese stock markets, with the [[Nikkei 225]] index plunging by 1,025 points on the day following the quake. This financial damage was the immediate cause for the collapse of [[Barings Bank]] due to the actions of [[Nick Leeson]], who had speculated vast amounts of money on Japanese and Singaporean derivatives. Discussions of Japan's \"[[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]]\" tend towards purely economic analysis, and neglect the impact of the earthquake on the Japanese economy which at the time was already suffering from recession.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDespite this devastation in a big production center, the local economy recovered very quickly.<ref name=\"Economist1\"/> Even though less than half the port facilities had been rebuilt by that stage, within a year import volumes through the port had recovered fully and export volumes were nearly back to where they would have been without the disaster.<ref name=\"Economist1\"/> Less than 15 months after the earthquake, in March 1996, manufacturing activity in greater Kobe was at 98% of its projected pre-quake level.<ref name=\"Economist1\"/>{{clear}}\n\n===Volunteerism===\n\nThe fact that volunteers from all over Japan converged on Kobe to help victims of the quake was an important event in the history of volunteerism in Japan. The year 1995 is often regarded as a turning point in the emergence of volunteerism as a major form of civic engagement.\n\nIn December 1995, the government declared January 17 a national \"Disaster Prevention and Volunteerism Day\", and the week from January 15 to 21 a national \"Disaster Prevention and Volunteerism Week\", to be commemorated with lectures, seminars, and other events designed to encourage voluntary disaster preparedness and relief efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bousai.go.jp/volunteer/html/detail_kakugi.html|title='Disaster Prevention and Volunteerism Day' and 'Disaster Prevention and Volunteerism Week'|publisher=Cabinet Office, Government of Japan|language=Japanese|date=December 15, 1995|accessdate=2009-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525125143/http://www.bousai.go.jp/volunteer/html/detail_kakugi.html|archive-date=May 25, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Disaster planning===\nThe earthquake proved to be a major wake-up call for Japanese disaster prevention authorities. Japan installed rubber blocks under bridges to absorb the shock and rebuilt buildings further apart to prevent collateral damage. The national government changed its disaster response policies in the wake of the earthquake, and its response to the [[2004 Ch\u016betsu earthquake]] was significantly faster and more effective. The Ground Self-Defense Forces were given automatic authority to respond to earthquakes over a certain magnitude, which allowed them to deploy to the [[Niigata Prefecture|Niigata region]] within minutes. Control over fire response was likewise handed over from local fire departments to a central command base in Tokyo and Kyoto.<ref>{{cite web|author=Burritt Sabin|date=October 31, 2004|url=http://www.japaninc.com/jin295|title=The Great Hanshin Earthquake: Lessons for Niigata|work=J@pan Inc Newsletter (No. 295)|publisher=Japan Inc Communications|accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fire char kobe 2005.0117.jpg|thumb|1.17 memorial in Kobe in January 2005, ten years later]]\n\nIn response to the widespread damage to transportation infrastructure, and the resulting effect on emergency response times in the disaster area, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport began designating special disaster prevention routes and reinforcing the roads and surrounding buildings so as to keep them as intact as possible in the event of another earthquake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kkr.mlit.go.jp/en/topics_hanshin2.html|title=Restoration from the earthquake disaster \u2013 City planning based on the lessons learned from the disaster|work=Great Hanshin Earthquake Restoration|publisher=Kinki Regional Development Bureau, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport|accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref> Hy\u014dgo's prefectural government invested millions of yen in the following years to build earthquake-proof shelters and supplies in public parks.<ref>{{cite web|author=Japan Echo Inc.|date=April 2, 1998|url=http://web-japan.org/trends98/honbun/ntj980403.html|title=Earthquake Readiness: From Underground Stores to Satellite Monitoring|work=Trends in JAPAN|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]}}</ref>\n\n===Memorials===\n\nThe [[Kobe Luminarie]] is an event held for approximately two weeks every December.

In addition, residents were afraid to return home because of aftershocks that lasted several days (74 of which were strong enough to be felt).\n\nThe majority of deaths, over 4,000, occurred in cities and suburbs in [[Hy\u014dgo Prefecture]].  A total of 68 children under the age of 18 were orphaned, while 332 additional children lost one parent.<ref>[[Kyodo News]], \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110402f2.html Hunt for tsunami orphans hampered, unprecedented]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', April 2, 2011, p. 4.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | image1 = Nojima fault top view.jpg\n | image2 = Port of Kobe Earthquake Memorial Park2.jpg\n | footer =  A section of the [[Nojima Fault]] (left) and preserved damage at the Earthquake Memorial Park near the port of Kobe\n }}\n\nOne in five of the buildings in the worst-hit areas were completely destroyed (or rendered uninhabitable). About 22% of the offices in Kobe's central business district were rendered unusable, and over half of the houses in that area were deemed unfit to live in. High rise buildings that were built after the modern 1981 building code suffered little; however, those that were not constructed to these standards suffered serious structural damage. Most of the older traditional houses had heavy tiled roofs which weighed around two tons, intended to resist the frequent typhoons that plagued Kobe, but they were only held up by a light wood support frame. When the wood supports gave way, the roof crushed the unreinforced walls and floors in a [[Progressive collapse|pancake collapse]]. Newer homes have reinforced walls and lighter roofs to avoid this, but are more susceptible to typhoons.\n\nThe damage to highways and subways was the most graphic image of the earthquake, and images of the collapsed elevated [[Kobe Route]] of the [[Hanshin Expressway]] made front pages of newspapers worldwide. Most people in Japan believed those structures to be relatively safe from earthquake damage because of the steel-reinforced concrete design. Although the initial belief was construction had been negligent, it was later shown that most of the collapsed structures were constructed properly according to the building codes in force in the 1960s. However, the steel-reinforcement specifications in the 1960s regulations had already been discovered to be inadequate and revised several times, the latest revision being in 1981, which proved effective but [[grandfather clause|only applied to new structures]].\n\n[[File:Hanshin-Awaji earthquake 1995 Kashiwai-building 001.jpg|thumb|180px|Immediately before the collapse of the Kashiwai building]]\n\nTen spans of the Kobe Route elevated expressway were knocked over in three locations across Kobe and Nishinomiya, blocking a link that carried forty percent of Osaka-Kobe road traffic. Half of the elevated expressway's piers were damaged in some way, and the entire route was not reopened until September 30, 1996. Three bridges on the less heavily used Route 2 were damaged, but the highway was reopened well ahead of Route 3 and served as one of the main intercity road links for a time. The [[Meishin Expressway]] was only lightly damaged, but was closed during the day until February 17, 1995 so that emergency vehicles could easily access the hardest-hit areas to the west. It wasn't until July 29 that all four lanes were open to traffic along one section.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kitamura|Yamamoto|Fujii|1998|p=240}}</ref> Many surface highways were clogged for some time due to the collapse of higher-capacity elevated highways.\n\nMost railways in the region were also damaged. In the aftermath of the earthquake, only 30% of the Osaka-Kobe railway tracks were operational. [[Daikai Station]] on the [[Kobe Rapid Railway]] line collapsed, bringing down part of [[Japan National Route 28|National Route 28]] above it. Wooden supports collapsed inside supposedly solid concrete pilings under the tracks of the [[Shinkansen]] high-speed rail line, causing the entire line to shut down. However, the railways rebounded quickly after the quake, reaching 80% operability in one month. The [[Kobe Municipal Subway]] resumed operation the day after the earthquake with limited service between {{STN|Seishin-Chuo}} and {{STN|Itayado}} stations (along with the [[Hokushin Kyuko Electric Railway]] between {{STN|Tanigami}} and {{STN|Shin-Kobe}}); service resumed across the entire line on February 16, 1995, with full service resuming a month later after repairs were completed. Trains continued to operate with speed restrictions until July 21, 1995.\n\nArtificial islands, such as the modern [[Rokk\u014d Island]] and especially [[Port Island]] in Kobe, suffered severe subsidence due to [[soil liquefaction|liquefaction]] of the soil; water breaking through the surface and flooding those islands was initially believed to have seeped in from the sea, but in fact rose from the liquefied remains of once-solid soils used to construct the islands. However, the newly completed artificial island supporting [[Kansai International Airport]] was not significantly affected, due to being further away from the epicenter and because it was built to the latest standards. The [[Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge]], under construction near the earthquake's epicenter, was not damaged but was reportedly lengthened by a full meter due to horizontal displacement along the activated tectonic fault.\n\n===Nomenclature===\nOutside Japan the earthquake is commonly known as the Kobe earthquake. In Japan, the disaster by this earthquake is officially called {{Nihongo4|The Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake Disaster|\u962a\u795e\u30fb\u6de1\u8def\u5927\u9707\u707d|Hanshin-Awaji Daishinsai}}, which is often shortened to {{Nihongo4|The Great Hanshin Earthquake Disaster|\u962a\u795e\u5927\u9707\u707d|Hanshin Daishinsai}}. ''Hanshin'' refers to the region between Osaka and Kobe. In the scientific literature it is often called the {{Nihongo4|1995 Southern Hy\u014dgo Prefecture Earthquake|\u5e73\u62107\u5e74(1995\u5e74)\u5175\u5eab\u770c\u5357\u90e8\u5730\u9707|Heisei 7 nen (1995 nen) Hy\u014dgo-ken Nanbu Jishin}}, the name chosen by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] in the week after the main shock.\n\n==Other aspects==\n[[File:Hanshin-Awaji earthquake 1995 337.jpg|thumb|Damage in Sannomiya]]\n\nThe quake ravaged many of the facilities of what was then the world's sixth-largest container port and the source of nearly 40% of Kobe's industrial output.<ref name=\"Economist1\">{{Cite journal|title=Economics Focus: The Cost of calamity|journal=The Economist|volume=398|issue=8725|page=68|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|date=March 19\u201325, 2011|url=http://www.economist.com}}</ref>\n\nThe sheer size of the earthquake caused a major decline in Japanese stock markets, with the [[Nikkei 225]] index plunging by 1,025 points on the day following the quake. This financial damage was the immediate cause for the collapse of [[Barings Bank]] due to the actions of [[Nick Leeson]], who had speculated vast amounts of money on Japanese and Singaporean derivatives. Discussions of Japan's \"[[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]]\" tend towards purely economic analysis, and neglect the impact of the earthquake on the Japanese economy which at the time was already suffering from recession.{{fact|date=April 2020}} \n\nDespite this devastation in a big production center, the local economy recovered very quickly.<ref name=\"Economist1\"/> Even though less than half the port facilities had been rebuilt by that stage, within a year import volumes through the port had recovered fully and export volumes were nearly back to where they would have been without the disaster.<ref name=\"Economist1\"/> Less than 15 months after the earthquake, in March 1996, manufacturing activity in greater Kobe was at 98% of its projected pre-quake level.<ref name=\"Economist1\"/>{{clear}}\n\n===Volunteerism===\n\nThe fact that volunteers from all over Japan converged on Kobe to help victims of the quake was an important event in the history of volunteerism in Japan. The year 1995 is often regarded as a turning point in the emergence of volunteerism as a major form of civic engagement.\n\nIn December 1995, the government declared January 17 a national \"Disaster Prevention and Volunteerism Day\", and the week from January 15 to 21 a national \"Disaster Prevention and Volunteerism Week\", to be commemorated with lectures, seminars, and other events designed to encourage voluntary disaster preparedness and relief efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bousai.go.jp/volunteer/html/detail_kakugi.html|title='Disaster Prevention and Volunteerism Day' and 'Disaster Prevention and Volunteerism Week'|publisher=Cabinet Office, Government of Japan|language=Japanese|date=December 15, 1995|accessdate=2009-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525125143/http://www.bousai.go.jp/volunteer/html/detail_kakugi.html|archive-date=May 25, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Disaster planning===\nThe earthquake proved to be a major wake-up call for Japanese disaster prevention authorities. Japan installed rubber blocks under bridges to absorb the shock and rebuilt buildings further apart to prevent collateral damage. The national government changed its disaster response policies in the wake of the earthquake, and its response to the [[2004 Ch\u016betsu earthquake]] was significantly faster and more effective. The Ground Self-Defense Forces were given automatic authority to respond to earthquakes over a certain magnitude, which allowed them to deploy to the [[Niigata Prefecture|Niigata region]] within minutes.

He had applied for a fellowship to the [[University of Leeds]], but the Fulbright Program had a surplus of applications for England and not that many for Germany. Countryman had studied German in both high school and university, and agreed to switch countries.<ref name=bio/>\n\nIn 1955, he joined the [[United States Air Force]], serving in the [[Strategic Air Command]] for three years.

His overseas experience sparked his desire to join the [[United States Foreign Service]], and while studying for his master's degree at the [[University of Miami]], he also studied for the Foreign Service exam.

He scored high in his German language test and was recommended to study a \"hard\" language like [[Turkish language|Turkish]] for a Near East posting. He briefly worked in the [[Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs]], which covered Turkey at the time, and then began his Turkish language course. He reported to the diplomatic mission in [[Istanbul]] in January 1963.<ref name=bio/>\n\nCountryman's posting required him to serve as a general rotation officer in each of the mission's four departments: consular, administrative, economic, and political. When officers in the consular and political departments left unexpectedly, Countryman filled their place.

At the time, the British still maintained colonial bases in the area under the supervision of their [[Political Resident]] in [[Bahrain]]. The British desired an American presence, however, and the US consulate liaised with the British. During his time in Saudi Arabia, Countryman assisted in establishing all the administrative posts for the United States in [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Oman]].

Countryman explained: \"It was in Israel's best interest that the United States had access to oil and there be stable oil and financial markets in the world. So then the issues came down to just how sophisticated the weaponry is that you sell to Saudi Arabia, and what controls do you put in place so you make sure it is not used against Israel\".

Before the age of ten, he appeared in more than a dozen Hollywood films, and afterwards had a brief career on the New York stage. A graduate of a Jesuit military prep school, he served in the [[United States Air Force]] and then entered the [[United States Foreign Service]] in 1962. He served various postings in the Middle East and Africa before being appointed [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Oman|United States Ambassador to Oman]] from 1981 to 1985. Following his 35-year career in the US Foreign Service, he served as Executive Director of the Mission for Peace and Cooperation in the Middle East under the auspices of [[Search for Common Ground]]. He speaks German, Arabic, French, and Turkish.\n\n==Early life and family==\nJohn Russell Countryman was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, on January 25, 1933.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=https://www.adst.org/OH%20TOCs/Countryman,%20John%20R.toc.pdf|title=Ambassador John R.

He had applied for a fellowship to the [[University of Leeds]], but the Fulbright Program had a surplus of applications for England and not that many for Germany. Countryman had studied German in both high school and university, and agreed to switch countries.<ref name=bio/>\n\nIn 1955, he joined the [[United States Air Force]], serving in the [[Strategic Air Command]] for three years. He mainly flew [[Tanker (aircraft)|tanker]] aircraft such as the [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter|KC-97]] and [[Boeing KB-29 Superfortress|KB-29]], but also flew the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|B-47]] and [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]. He served primarily in the mainland United States, although he did provide limited support for personnel and equipment transfers between Alaska and Japan. His overseas experience sparked his desire to join the [[United States Foreign Service]], and while studying for his master's degree at the [[University of Miami]], he also studied for the Foreign Service exam. He successfully passed the written and oral exams in 1961, the same year he received his master's degree in English and American literature with his thesis on \"The German Element in the Writings of [[Thomas Wolfe]]\".<ref name=bio/><ref name=Xavier/> {{sfn|Countryman|1961|page=90}} While waiting to enter the Foreign Service, he worked as a city reporter for the ''[[The News-Times]]'' in [[Danbury, Connecticut]]. He joined the Foreign Service in February 1962.<ref name=bio/>\n\n==Foreign Service career==\nAt nearly 30 years of age, Countryman was one of the oldest in his incoming class, as most entrants had just graduated college. He scored high in his German language test and was recommended to study a \"hard\" language like [[Turkish language|Turkish]] for a Near East posting. He briefly worked in the [[Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs]], which covered Turkey at the time, and then began his Turkish language course. He reported to the diplomatic mission in [[Istanbul]] in January 1963.<ref name=bio/>\n\nCountryman's posting required him to serve as a general rotation officer in each of the mission's four departments: consular, administrative, economic, and political. When officers in the consular and political departments left unexpectedly, Countryman filled their place. In January 1965 he completed his posting and was assigned to the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] in Washington, D.C. as a staff aide to [[W. Averell Harriman|Averell Harriman]].<ref name=bio/>\n\n[[File:AUB 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[American University of Beirut]]]]\nIn August 1966, Countryman applied for [[Arabic]] language training with the intention of concentrating his diplomatic service on one geographic area.

He also completed a three-month training course as a petroleum attache at [[Exxon]] in [[Houston, Texas]].

At the time, the British still maintained colonial bases in the area under the supervision of their [[Political Resident]] in [[Bahrain]]. The British desired an American presence, however, and the US consulate liaised with the British. During his time in Saudi Arabia, Countryman assisted in establishing all the administrative posts for the United States in [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Oman]].

Countryman explained: \"It was in Israel's best interest that the United States had access to oil and there be stable oil and financial markets in the world. So then the issues came down to just how sophisticated the weaponry is that you sell to Saudi Arabia, and what controls do you put in place so you make sure it is not used against Israel\".
