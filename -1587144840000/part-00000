The loss of the ''Runnymede'' and the ''Briton'' in 1844 during the same storm, while transporting goods and passengers between India and Australia, and the continuous attacks launched by the natives, which the survivors fought off, alarmed the British government.<ref>Kingston, W.H.G. (1873) ''Shipwrecks and Disasters at Sea''.  George Routledge and Sons, London.</ref> In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a [[Cellular Jail|convict establishment]], but the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] forced a delay in its construction. However, because the rebellion gave the British so many prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison urgently necessary. Construction began in November 1857 at Port Blair using inmates' labour, avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp that seemed to have been the source of many of the earlier problems at Port Cornwallis.\n\n17 May 1859 was another major day for Andaman. The [[Battle of Aberdeen (Andaman Islands)|Battle of Aberdeen]] was fought between the [[Great Andamanese]] tribe and the British. Today, a memorial stands in Andaman water sports complex as a tribute to the people who lost their lives. Fearing foreign invasion and with help from an escaped convict from Cellular Jail, the Great Andamanese stormed the British post, but they were outnumbered and soon suffered heavy loss of life. Later, it was identified that an escaped convict named Doodnath had changed sides and informed the British about the tribe's plans. Today, the tribe has been reduced to some 50 people, with less than 50% of them adults. The government of the Andaman Islands is making efforts to increase the headcount of this tribe.<ref name=\"Rapidiq\">{{cite web|url=https://rapidiq.wordpress.com/2012/04/08/the-rise-and-the-fall-of-the-great-andamanese/|title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Andamanese|work=Confessions of a Linguist!|date=8 April 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"One India\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oneindia.com/2007/05/17/who-are-heroes-of-battle-of-aberdeen-1179405748.html|title=Who are heroes of Battle of Aberdeen?|work=oneindia.com|date=17 May 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Andaman Sheekha\">{{cite web|url=http://www.andamansheekha.com/2012/05/16/tribute-at-the-memorial-of-battle-of-aberdeen-today/|title=Tribute at the Memorial of \"Battle of Aberdeen\" Today|author =sanjib|work=andamansheekha.com|date=15 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867, the ship ''Nineveh'' wrecked on the reef of North Sentinel Island.

George Routledge and Sons, London.</ref> In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a [[Cellular Jail|convict establishment]], but the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] forced a delay in its construction. However, because the rebellion gave the British so many prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison urgently necessary. Construction began in November 1857 at Port Blair using inmates' labour, avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp that seemed to have been the source of many of the earlier problems at Port Cornwallis.\n\n17 May 1859 was another major day for Andaman. The [[Battle of Aberdeen (Andaman Islands)|Battle of Aberdeen]] was fought between the [[Great Andamanese]] tribe and the British. Today, a memorial stands in Andaman water sports complex as a tribute to the people who lost their lives. Fearing foreign invasion and with help from an escaped convict from Cellular Jail, the Great Andamanese stormed the British post, but they were outnumbered and soon suffered heavy loss of life. Later, it was identified that an escaped convict named Doodnath had changed sides and informed the British about the tribe's plans. Today, the tribe has been reduced to some 50 people, with less than 50% of them adults.

Rainfall is irregular, usually dry during the north-east monsoons, and very wet during the south-west monsoons.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=956}}\n\n==Flora==\nThe Middle Andamans harbour mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers.\n\nThe natural vegetation of the Andamans is tropical forest, with [[mangrove]]s on the coast. The rainforests are similar in composition to those of the west coast of Burma. Most of the forests are evergreen, but there are areas of deciduous forest on North Andaman, [[Middle Andaman Island|Middle Andaman]], [[Baratang]] and parts of [[South Andaman Island]]. The South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns and orchids.\n\nThe Andaman forests are largely unspoiled, despite logging and the demands of the fast-growing population driven by immigration from the Indian mainland. There are protected areas on [[Little Andaman Island|Little Andaman]], [[Narcondam Island|Narcondam]], North Andaman and South Andaman, but these are mainly aimed at preserving the coast and the marine wildlife rather than the rainforests.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0101 |name=Andaman Islands rain forests|accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref> Threats to wildlife come from introduced species including rats, dogs, cats and the elephants of [[Interview Island]] and North Andaman.\n\n===Timber===\n[[File:Timber.JPG|thumb|upright=1|right|Stilt houses in an Andamanese timber operation]]\nAndaman forests contain 200 or more timber producing species of trees, out of which about 30 varieties are considered to be commercial. Major commercial timber species are Gurjan (''[[Dipterocarpus]]'' spp.) and [[Padauk]] (''[[Pterocarpus dalbergioides]]''). The following ornamental woods are noted for their pronounced grain formation:\n\n* Marble wood (''[[Diospyros|Diospyros marmorata]]'')\n* Padauk (''[[Pterocarpus dalbergioides]]'')\n* Silver grey (a special formation of wood in white [[utkarsh]])\n* Chooi (''[[Sageraea|Sageraea elliptica]]'')\n* Kokko (''[[Albizzia lebbeck]]'')\n\nPadauk wood is sturdier than teak and is widely used for furniture making.\n\nThere are [[burr wood]] and [[buttress root]] formations in Andaman Padauk.

They are habitat restricted, so the population is stable but not large. Populations occur throughout available mangrove habitat on all major islands, including a few creeks on Havelock. The species uses the ocean as a means of travel between different rivers and estuaries, thus they are not as commonly observed in open ocean. It is best to avoid swimming near mangrove areas or the mouths of creeks; swimming in the open ocean should be safe, but it is best to have a spotter around.\n\n==Religion==\nMost of the tribal people in Andaman and Nicobar Islands believe in a religion that can be described as a form of [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Animism]].

The Great Andamanese formed 10 tribes of 5,000 people total.\n\nAs the numbers of settlers from the mainland increased (at first mostly prisoners and involuntary [[indentured labour]]ers, later purposely recruited farmers), these indigenous people lost territory and numbers in the face of punitive expeditions by British troops, land encroachment and various epidemic diseases.\n\nPresently, there remain only approximately 400\u2013450 indigenous Andamanese. The Jangil are extinct. Most of the Great Andamanese tribes are extinct, and the survivors, now just 52, speak mostly [[Bengali language|Bengali]].<ref>Malekar, Anosh (1 August 2011) [http://infochangeindia.org/Media/Languages-of-India/The-case-for-a-linguistic-survey.html \"The case for a linguisitic survey,\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927215058/http://infochangeindia.org/Media/Languages-of-India/The-case-for-a-linguistic-survey.html |date=27 September 2011 }} ''Infochange Media''.</ref> The Onge are reduced to less than 100 people.

The Andaman Islands form a single administrative district within the Union Territory, the [[Andaman district]] (the Nicobar Islands were separated and established as the new [[Nicobar district]] in 1974).\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe islands are prominently featured in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] 1890 mystery ''[[The Sign of the Four]].'' The magistrate in [[Lady Gregory]]'s play ''[[Spreading the News]]'' had formerly served in the islands.\n\n[[M. M. Kaye]]'s 1985 novel ''Death in the Andamans'' and [[Marianne Wiggins]]' 1989 novel ''John Dollar'' are set in the islands. The latter begins with an expedition from Burma to celebrate King George's birthday, but turns into a grim survival story after an earthquake and tsunami. [[Priyadarshan]]'s 1996 film ''[[Kaalapani (1996 film)|Kaalapani]]'' (Malayalam; ''[[Sirai Chaalai]]'' in Tamil) depicts the Indian freedom struggle and the lives of prisoners in the [[Cellular Jail]] in Port Blair. ''Island's End'' is a 2011 novel by [[Padma Venkatraman]] about the training of an indigenous shaman. A principal character in the novel ''[[Six Suspects (novel)|Six Suspects]]'' by [[Vikas Swarup]] is from the Andaman Islands.\n\nBrodie Moncur, the main protagonist of [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd's]] 2018 novel ''Love is Blind'', spends time in the Andaman Islands in the early years of the 20th century.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe only commercial airport in the islands is [[Veer Savarkar International Airport]] in [[Port Blair]], which has scheduled services to [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[New Delhi]], [[Bengaluru]] and [[Visakhapatnam]]. The airport is under the control of the [[Indian Navy]].

Fares are high during the peak seasons of spring and winter, although fares have decreased over time due to the expansion of the civil aviation industry in India. Private flights are also allowed to land in Port Blair airport with prior permission.\n\nThere is also a ship service from Chennai, Visakhapatnam and Kolkata.

Chuck expresses suspicion about the legality of Jimmy's methods, pointing out only one response to the law firms' mailed notices to prospective clients, and wondering if Jimmy has engaged in illegal solicitation. Jimmy explains that retirement homes are tight knit communities and information spreads fast by word of mouth, which satisfies everyone but Kim.  Kim is wary and warns Jimmy to keep his methods legitimate, since she recommended him to D&M and his actions will reflect on her reputation.\n\nJimmy tries to use the standard mailing of legal notices to prospective Sandpiper clients, but with little success, due to the elderly recipients either ignoring the letters or Sandpiper intercepting their mail. Jimmy suggests filming a targeted television ad, since the Sandpiper residents set aside one hour of free time to watch television. Cliff Main is intrigued by Jimmy's idea and promises to talk to him more about it when he returns from a week-long business trip.

He contacts the sales department of [[KKTV]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], a market that showed zero responses from the Sandpiper legal notice mailings, and arranged for the commercial to be run in that market as an \"experiment\". The ad depicts one of his elderly clients as a poor old woman being victimized by Sandpiper Crossing and the ad closes by urging residents to call D&M. Kim is impressed with Jimmy's work, and Jimmy decides to run the ad without the firm's approval. It is a massive success, with D&M gaining over a hundred clients in a single day. However, Cliff is furious that Jimmy released the ad without consulting him or the partners first and demands an explanation from him. Jimmy then lies to Kim about the setback.\n\nStacey voices concerns to Mike about gunshots she has heard in her neighborhood over the past two nights, and says the police have done nothing about them. Mike does overnight [[surveillance]] without Stacey's knowledge and finds that the \"gunshots\" were apparently the sound of newspaper deliveries hitting the sidewalk. Stacey calls Mike the following morning, and says there were three more gunshots the night before.  Mike visits Stacey's house and she points out a chip in an outside wall that she insists is from a bullet. Despite knowing that there were no gunshots, Mike tells Stacey what she wants to hear \u2013 that he will help her get out of the neighborhood.\n\nDr. Caldera offers Mike a lucrative job as an [[Mob enforcer|enforcer]] for a [[loan shark]], which pays better than bodyguard jobs. Mike declines, as he is not interested in performing any more illegal work, especially work that requires him to hurt or kill others. Caldera points out that if Mike wants \"next level pay\", he must be willing to do \"next level work.\" Mike later receives a call from Caldera, who tells him about a job offer with a client who specifically requested Mike.

Its screenplay, by [[James Ivory]], who also co-produced, is based on the [[Call Me by Your Name (novel)|2007 novel of the same name]] by [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]]. The film is the final installment in Guadagnino's thematic \"Desire\" trilogy, after ''[[I Am Love (film)|I Am Love]]'' (2009), and ''[[A Bigger Splash (2015 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' (2015). Set in 1983 in northern Italy, ''Call Me by Your Name'' chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, [[Elio Perlman]] ([[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]]), and Oliver ([[Armie Hammer]]), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]), an archaeology professor. The film also stars the French actresses [[Amira Casar]], [[Esther Garrel]], and [[Victoire Du Bois]].\n\nDevelopment began in 2007 when producers [[Peter Spears]] and [[Howard Rosenman]] [[optioned]] the rights to Aciman's novel. Ivory had been chosen to co-direct with Guadagnino, but stepped down in 2016. Guadagnino had joined the project as a [[location scout]], and eventually became sole director, and co-producer. ''Call Me by Your Name'' was financed by several international companies, and its [[principal photography]] took place mainly in the city and {{Lang|it|[[comune]]}} of [[Crema, Lombardy]], between May and June 2016. Cinematographer [[Sayombhu Mukdeeprom]] used [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]], as opposed to employing [[digital cinematography]]. The filmmakers spent weeks decorating [[Villa Albergoni]], one of the main shooting locations. Guadagnino curated [[Call Me by Your Name: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|the film's soundtrack]], which features two original songs by American singer-songwriter [[Sufjan Stevens]].\n\n[[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired <!-- US-only? -->distribution rights to ''Call Me by Your Name'' before its premiere at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2017. The film began a [[limited release]] in the United States on November 24, 2017, and went on general release on January 19, 2018. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Ivory's screenplay, Guadagnino's direction, and the performances of Chalamet, Hammer, and Stuhlbarg. The film garnered [[List of accolades received by Call Me by Your Name (film)|a number of accolades]], including many for its screenplay, direction, acting, and music. It received four nominations at the [[90th Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The screenplay also won at the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]], [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2017]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the summer of 1983. [[Elio Perlman|Elio]], a 17-year-old [[Jewish American]], lives with his parents in rural [[northern Italy]]. Elio's father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old graduate student, Oliver, who is also Jewish-American, to live with the family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective [[bibliophile]] and a talented musician, initially thinks he has little in common with Oliver, who has a carefree and exuberant personality. Elio resents having to give up his bedroom to Oliver for the duration of his stay, and spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with childhood friend, Marzia. Meanwhile, Oliver admits being attracted to one of the local girls, much to Elio's annoyance.\n\nElio and Oliver swim together, go for long walks into town, and accompany Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio begins a sexual relationship with Marzia and brags about it in front of Oliver to gauge his reaction, but nonetheless finds himself increasingly attracted to him. During a trip to the local post office, Elio indirectly confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him he should not act on them. Later that day, the two kiss, but Oliver is reluctant to go any further. They grow distant.\n\nIn response to a note from Elio, Oliver leaves a message on his desk suggesting they meet at midnight. Elio spends the day with Marzia, but longs to see Oliver. At midnight, he approaches Oliver and their rendezvous results in the two sleeping together for the first time. They become more physically and emotionally intimate in the days that follow, frequenting sexual encounters while still keeping their relationship a secret. One day, in bed, Oliver says to Elio, \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.\" Now completely smitten with Oliver, Elio starts avoiding Marzia.\n\nAs the end of Oliver's stay approaches, he and Elio both find themselves overcome by uncertainty and longing. Elio's parents, who are privately aware of the bond between the two but do not address it openly, recommend he and Oliver visit [[Bergamo]] together before Oliver returns home to the U.S. They spend three romantic days together. Elio, heartbroken after Oliver's departure, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up from the train station and take him home. Marzia is sympathetic to Elio's feelings and says she wants to remain friends. Elio's father, observing his deep sadness, tells him he was aware of his relationship with Oliver and confesses to almost having had a similar relationship in his own youth. He urges Elio to learn from his grief and grow, instead of just moving on too quickly.\n\nDuring [[Hanukkah]], Oliver calls Elio's family to tell them he is engaged to be married. He tells Elio that he remembers everything very clearly. After the call, Elio sits down by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reminiscing, as his parents and the house staff prepare a holiday dinner. The movie ends when Elio, still seated by the fireplace and now appearing to be more content, throws a glance into the camera as his mother calls for him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as [[Elio Perlman]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Oliver\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Samuel Perlman{{efn|Mr. Perlman's full name is mentioned in the film as Samuel Perlman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|title=Michael Stuhlbarg's 'fragile balancing act' in playing a supportive dad in 'Call Me by Your Name'|first=Margy|last=Rochlin|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=July 2, 2018|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122213946/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|archivedate=January 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n* [[Amira Casar]] as Annella Perlman\n* [[Esther Garrel]] as Marzia\n* [[Victoire Du Bois]] as Chiara\n* Vanda Capriolo as Mafalda\n* Antonio Rimoldi as Anchise\n* Elena Bucci as Bambi\n* Marco Sgrosso as Nico\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]] as Mounir\n* [[Peter Spears]] as Isaac\n* [[Beppe Grillo]] as himself <small>(archive footage)</small><ref>{{cite news|last=Gallo|first=Francesco|date=February 14, 2017|title=Luca Guadagnino, la mia storia gay per famiglie|trans-title=Luca Guadagnino, my gay story for families|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|language=it|work=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|access-date=February 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225014018/http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Styles and themes==\n''Call Me by Your Name'' is the final installment in a thematic trilogy Guadagnino calls his \"Desire\" trilogy;

Its screenplay, by [[James Ivory]], who also co-produced, is based on the [[Call Me by Your Name (novel)|2007 novel of the same name]] by [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]]. The film is the final installment in Guadagnino's thematic \"Desire\" trilogy, after ''[[I Am Love (film)|I Am Love]]'' (2009), and ''[[A Bigger Splash (2015 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' (2015). Set in 1983 in northern Italy, ''Call Me by Your Name'' chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, [[Elio Perlman]] ([[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]]), and Oliver ([[Armie Hammer]]), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]), an archaeology professor. The film also stars the French actresses [[Amira Casar]], [[Esther Garrel]], and [[Victoire Du Bois]].\n\nDevelopment began in 2007 when producers [[Peter Spears]] and [[Howard Rosenman]] [[optioned]] the rights to Aciman's novel. Ivory had been chosen to co-direct with Guadagnino, but stepped down in 2016. Guadagnino had joined the project as a [[location scout]], and eventually became sole director, and co-producer. ''Call Me by Your Name'' was financed by several international companies, and its [[principal photography]] took place mainly in the city and {{Lang|it|[[comune]]}} of [[Crema, Lombardy]], between May and June 2016. Cinematographer [[Sayombhu Mukdeeprom]] used [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]], as opposed to employing [[digital cinematography]]. The filmmakers spent weeks decorating [[Villa Albergoni]], one of the main shooting locations. Guadagnino curated [[Call Me by Your Name: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|the film's soundtrack]], which features two original songs by American singer-songwriter [[Sufjan Stevens]].\n\n[[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired <!-- US-only? -->distribution rights to ''Call Me by Your Name'' before its premiere at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2017. The film began a [[limited release]] in the United States on November 24, 2017, and went on general release on January 19, 2018. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Ivory's screenplay, Guadagnino's direction, and the performances of Chalamet, Hammer, and Stuhlbarg. The film garnered [[List of accolades received by Call Me by Your Name (film)|a number of accolades]], including many for its screenplay, direction, acting, and music. It received four nominations at the [[90th Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The screenplay also won at the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]], [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2017]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the summer of 1983. [[Elio Perlman|Elio]], a 17-year-old [[Jewish American]], lives with his parents in rural [[northern Italy]]. Elio's father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old graduate student, Oliver, who is also Jewish-American, to live with the family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective [[bibliophile]] and a talented musician, initially thinks he has little in common with Oliver, who has a carefree and exuberant personality. Elio resents having to give up his bedroom to Oliver for the duration of his stay, and spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with childhood friend, Marzia. Meanwhile, Oliver admits being attracted to one of the local girls, much to Elio's annoyance.\n\nElio and Oliver swim together, go for long walks into town, and accompany Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio begins a sexual relationship with Marzia and brags about it in front of Oliver to gauge his reaction, but nonetheless finds himself increasingly attracted to him. During a trip to the local post office, Elio indirectly confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him he should not act on them. Later that day, the two kiss, but Oliver is reluctant to go any further. They grow distant.\n\nIn response to a note from Elio, Oliver leaves a message on his desk suggesting they meet at midnight. Elio spends the day with Marzia, but longs to see Oliver. At midnight, he approaches Oliver and their rendezvous results in the two sleeping together for the first time. They become more physically and emotionally intimate in the days that follow, frequenting sexual encounters while still keeping their relationship a secret. One day, in bed, Oliver says to Elio, \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.\" Now completely smitten with Oliver, Elio starts avoiding Marzia.\n\nAs the end of Oliver's stay approaches, he and Elio both find themselves overcome by uncertainty and longing. Elio's parents, who are privately aware of the bond between the two but do not address it openly, recommend he and Oliver visit [[Bergamo]] together before Oliver returns home to the U.S. They spend three romantic days together. Elio, heartbroken after Oliver's departure, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up from the train station and take him home. Marzia is sympathetic to Elio's feelings and says she wants to remain friends. Elio's father, observing his deep sadness, tells him he was aware of his relationship with Oliver and confesses to almost having had a similar relationship in his own youth. He urges Elio to learn from his grief and grow, instead of just moving on too quickly.\n\nDuring [[Hanukkah]], Oliver calls Elio's family to tell them he is engaged to be married. He tells Elio that he remembers everything very clearly. After the call, Elio sits down by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reminiscing, as his parents and the house staff prepare a holiday dinner. The movie ends when Elio, still seated by the fireplace and now appearing to be more content, throws a glance into the camera as his mother calls for him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as [[Elio Perlman]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Oliver\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Samuel Perlman{{efn|Mr. Perlman's full name is mentioned in the film as Samuel Perlman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|title=Michael Stuhlbarg's 'fragile balancing act' in playing a supportive dad in 'Call Me by Your Name'|first=Margy|last=Rochlin|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=July 2, 2018|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122213946/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|archivedate=January 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n* [[Amira Casar]] as Annella Perlman\n* [[Esther Garrel]] as Marzia\n* [[Victoire Du Bois]] as Chiara\n* Vanda Capriolo as Mafalda\n* Antonio Rimoldi as Anchise\n* Elena Bucci as Bambi\n* Marco Sgrosso as Nico\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]] as Mounir\n* [[Peter Spears]] as Isaac\n* [[Beppe Grillo]] as himself <small>(archive footage)</small><ref>{{cite news|last=Gallo|first=Francesco|date=February 14, 2017|title=Luca Guadagnino, la mia storia gay per famiglie|trans-title=Luca Guadagnino, my gay story for families|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|language=it|work=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|access-date=February 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225014018/http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Styles and themes==\n''Call Me by Your Name'' is the final installment in a thematic trilogy Guadagnino calls his \"Desire\" trilogy;
