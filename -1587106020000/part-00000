She was named after the [[Battle of Savo Island]], to memorialize American casualties during the Japanese Navy's decisive victory in the [[Battle of Savo Island]], fought in support of the [[Guadalcanal campaign]]. Built for service during [[World War II]], the ship was launched in December 1943, commissioned in February 1944, and served as a frontline carrier throughout the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]] and the [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Philippines campaign]]. During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], she provided air cover for the replenishment carrier fleet. Postwar, she participated in [[Operation Magic Carpet]]. She was decommissioned in December 1946, when she was [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]]. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in February 1960.\n\n==Design and description==\n[[File:Inboard and outboard profiles of a Casablanca-class escort carrier, 1946.png|thumb|left|A profile of the design of {{USS|Takanis Bay|CVE-89|2}}, which was shared with all ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers.]]\n{{main|Casablanca-class escort carrier}}\n''Savo Island'' was a ''Casablanca''-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of [[aircraft carrier]]s ever built,{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}} and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her [[sister ship]]s, she was {{convert|512|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]], had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|65|ft|2|in|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{convert|20|ft|9|in|abbr=on}}. She [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|8188|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|standard]], {{cvt|10902|LT}} with a [[Full-load displacement|full load]]. She had a {{convert|257|ft|abbr=on}} long [[Hangar#Hangars aboard ships|hangar deck]] and a {{convert|477|ft|abbr=on}} long [[flight deck]]. She was powered with two [[Skinner Unaflow]] reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing {{convert|9000|hp|lk=in}}, thus enabling her to make {{Casablanca class speed}}. The ship had a cruising range of {{convert|10240|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|15|kn}}. Her compact size necessitated the installment of an [[aircraft catapult]] at her bow, and there were two [[Elevator#Elevators for aircraft|aircraft elevators]] to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}}{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}}\n\nOne [[5\"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|0|adj=on}}/38]] [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[dual-purpose gun]] was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by 8 [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} anti-aircraft guns]] in single mounts, as well as 12 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon {{convert|20|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} cannon]]s, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck.{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}} By the end of the war, ''Casablanca''-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to [[kamikaze]] attacks. ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]], she carried 16 [[Grumman F4F Wildcat#FM-1/-2 Wildcat|FM-2]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], and 12 [[Grumman TBF Avenger#TBM|TBM-1C]] [[torpedo bomber]]s, for a total of 28 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=109}} During the [[Battle off Samar]], she carried 17 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 29 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=121}} During the [[Battle of Mindoro]], she carried 24 FM-2 fighters and 9 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 33 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=251}} During the [[Battle of Lingayen Gulf]], she carried 19 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 31 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=277}} During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=349}}\n\n==Construction==\nHer construction was awarded to [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser Shipbuilding Company]], [[Vancouver, Washington]] under a [[Maritime Commission]] contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 27 September 1943 under the name ''Kaita Bay'', as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska.{{sfn|Maksel|2012}} She was laid down as MC hull 1115, the twenty-third of a series of fifty ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers. She was renamed ''Savo Island'' on 6 November 1943, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent ''Casablanca''-class carriers after naval or land engagements.{{sfn|Stubblebine|2011}} She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 22 December 1943; [[Ship sponsor|sponsored]] by Miss Margaret Taffinder; transferred to the United States Navy and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 February 1944, with [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] Clarence Eugene Ekstrom in command.{{sfn|Kaiser Vancouver|2010}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n==Service history==\nUpon being commissioned, ''Savo Island'' underwent a [[shakedown cruise]] down the West Coast to [[San Diego]], where she took on a load of replacement aircraft. Between 15 March 1944 and 2 July, she underwent two transport missions, ferrying aircraft to bases in the Southwest Pacific. On 6 July, she embarked Composite Squadron (VC) 27, which would be her aircraft contingent throughout the Marianas and Palau Islands campaign and the [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Philippines campaign of 1944\u201345]]. After a brief period of training off the waters of San Diego, she sailed west to [[Pearl Harbor]], where similar exercises were conducted. There, on 4 August, she was assigned to Task Group 32.7, the Western Escort Carrier Group, commanded by [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William Sample]], of the [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]], assigned to support the planned [[Battle of Peleliu|landings]] on the island of [[Peleliu]], of the [[Palau|Palau Islands]]. Her aircraft contingent began combat operations on 11 September, strafing and bombarding the island to soften up the defenses for the landings. Following the landing of [[United States Marine Corps|marines]], her aircraft transitioned into providing [[close air support]] and patrol missions, up until 30 September.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=109}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nOn 3 October, she was assigned to and joined Task Group 77.4, which was gathering at [[Manus Island]], part of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]].  She, accompanied with eighteen other escort carriers and their screens of [[battleships]], [[cruisers]], and [[destroyers]], steamed on 12 October for [[Leyte Gulf]], where they were expected to support the [[Battle of Leyte|landings]] on [[Leyte]], which marked the beginning of the Philippines campaign. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2, otherwise known as \"Taffy 2\", commanded by Rear Admiral [[Felix Stump]], she was positioned to the direct south of \"Taffy 3\", which was located to the direct east of the [[San Bernadino Strait]]. Arriving off the island on 18 October, her aircraft began carrying out naval patrols and strikes against predesignated targets. Once the [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] had landed on 20 October, her aircraft transitioned towards a focus on close air support, supporting the initial advances for the next few days.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=121}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nOn 23 October, the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] began. Almost the entirety of Japan's remaining surface fleet had been concentrated into a counterattack against the U.S. forces in the vicinity of the Philippines, which had threatened to cut off Japan's vital oil supply from Southeast Asia. Split into three groups, the Southern Force was defeated in the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], whilst [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[William Halsey Jr.]] sent the Third Fleet in an attack against the diversionary Northern Force. Therefore, the escort carriers which continued providing ground support had no capital ship screening, even as Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Center Force drove through the San Bernadino Strait during the night.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=148}} On the early morning of 25 October, the Center Force emerged into the waters of the Leyte Gulf, catching Taffy 3, some {{cvt|20|mi}} north of ''Savo Island'', by surprise.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=153}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nAs the American command came to an understanding of the severity of the situation, with the Center Force consisting of four battleships, six cruisers, and a large destroyer screen, the entirety of Taffy 2's aircraft were recalled to join the defense. ''Savo Island''{{'}}s fighters and torpedo bombers were not equipped to attack surface ships, with most of her bombers being loaded with [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]] and missiles for ground attacks.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=196}} Nonetheless, aircraft from ''Savo Island''{{'}}s VC-27 were amongst Taffy 2's first wave of strikes, launched at 7:37 in the morning. Some of the destroyers within Taffy 2's screen wandered north, before being confronted with some Japanese naval gunfire and being ordered to withdraw towards the escort carriers. Overall, ''Savo Island'' launched six strikes against the Japanese forces, with her aircraft notably landing a torpedo hit on a Japanese battleship and shooting down an [[Aichi E13A]] [[reconnaissance]] [[seaplane]] caught in the middle of the action.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=221}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nDiscouraged by the stiff resistance his Center Force had faced, including the loss of three cruisers, Admiral Kurita issued orders to withdraw in the late morning, sparing Taffy 3 from further destruction. As the Japanese forces withdrew, fighters from ''Savo Island'' took the opportunity to down four more Japanese planes.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=225}} Nonetheless, the escort carriers underwent concentrated Japanese attack again in the afternoon, this time from the air, including some of the first usage of [[kamikaze]] suicide attacks. The carrier continued supporting ground operations until 30 October, when Taffy 2 was reorganized into Task Unit 77.4.4, and ordered to withdraw back to Manus Island to rearm and replenish.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=241}} She sortied from Manus on 19 November, providing cover for convoys proceeding to Leyte Gulf from 22 November to 27 November, accompanied by two other escort carriers. Upon completing this task, she replenished at [[Kossol Roads]], before she left on 10 December, this time in support of the [[Battle of Mindoro|landings]] on the island of [[Mindoro]]. Her aircraft provided air cover as the landing crafts unloaded their troops, and provided close air support as they advanced. They also targeted air fields, from which kamikaze aircraft were beginning to make regular forays. The escort carriers were relieved by Army aircraft on 15 December, but she stayed offshore until 17 December because of indications of a Japanese surface raid, which never materialized. On 17 December, she steamed back to Manus Island.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=264}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n[[File:SavoIslandSuluSea.jpg|thumb|left|''Savo Island'' underway in the Sulu Sea, photographed from the battleship {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}}.]]\nAt Manus Island, ''Savo Island'' was assigned to Task Unit 77.4.2., the San Fabian Carrier Group.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=277}} On 27 December, the carriers, escorted by a large surface fleet, left Manus bound for [[Lingayen Gulf]], to the west of [[Luzon]]. There, the carriers would support the [[Sixth United States Army|6th Army]] [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|landings]] on Luzon. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2., ''Savo Island'' would provide air support and cover for the [[I Corps (United States)|I Army Corps]], which would land around the [[San Fabian, Pangasinan|San Fabian]] area. Pausing at [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]], the carriers entered the [[Sulu Sea]] on 3 January 1945, where they began being harried by aircraft, circling around on radar. Japanese planes continued appearing around the periphery of the American forces throughout 4 January, but it was not until 17:00 in the evening that the Japanese forces coalesced into a [[kamikaze]] strike, attacking at 17:12, achieving complete surprise, and sinking {{USS|Ommaney Bay|CVE-79|2}}.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=281}} \n\nThe following day, on 5 January, the kamikazes returned. At 17:43 in the evening, the [[battleship]] {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|2}} reported planes approaching from her starboard bow, and shortly afterwards, {{USS|Manila Bay|CVE-61|2}} had been hit by two kamikazes, heavily damaging the ship. A few minutes after the attack on ''Manila Bay'', a [[Nakajima Ki-43]] kamikaze dove towards ''Savo Island''. Engaged by several anti-aircraft batteries, the plane being trailing smoke some {{cvt|800|yds}} away from the carrier. As a reaction, ''Savo Island'' turned hard to starboard, whilst its {{cvt|24|in}} searchlight was pointed at the aircraft to try to blind the pilot. The plane, moving erratically, passed between the carrier's mast and the whip antenna, shearing off the carrier's radar antenna, before diving into the sea.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=295}}\n\nOn 6 January, the carriers proceeded into Lingayen Gulf, and started a heavy bombardment of Japanese defenses, flying 5,971 sorties in eleven days. On 9 January, the 6th Army moved onshore, encountering little resistance. ''Savo Island'' remained on station until 17 January, when the [[United States Air Force]] took over air operations on Luzon.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=316}}  She then proceeded south to operate to the northwest of Mindoro, to guard against any counterattacks on the American garrisons situated throughout the Northern Philippines, staying on station from 17 January until 29 January. During this period, on 19 January, Captain William Donald Anderson took command of the ship. Upon completing her patrols, she then provided cover for landings near [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] on 29 and 30 January, before retiring to [[Ulithi]] for repairs and replenishment. There, her aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 27, was replaced with Composite Squadron 91, which had previously served upon {{USS|Kitkun Bay|CVE-71|2}}. Upon receiving replacement pilots, she began a brief period of training exercises, before being assigned to Task Unit 52.1.1, in preparation for the [[Battle of Okinawa]].{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=349}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}} \n\nTransiting via Leyte, her aircraft provided air cover and patrols en route. On 26 March, along with two other escort carriers, she supported the [[77th Sustainment Brigade|77th Infantry Division]] as it occupied the [[Kerama Islands]]. On 27 March, she began bombing the main island of [[Okinawa]], with her fighters flying antiaircraft and antisubmarine patrols. On 7 April, the carrier left Task Unit 52.1.1., trading places with {{USS|Shamrock Bay|CVE-84|2}}, part of Task Group 50.8, the Logistics Support Group.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=363}} Therefore, from 7 to 16 April, she screened a replenishment convoy proceeding to the east of Okinawa. Upon the completion of that task, she continued providing close air support for American forces advancing down Okinawa. On 27 April, her aircraft bombed [[Sakishima Gunto]], an island situated halfway between Okinawa and [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. On 29 April, ''Savo Island'', along with {{USS|Marcus Island|CVE-77|2}} and {{USS|Saginaw Bay|CVE-82|2}}, were discharged from their task group, all sailing for overhaul in San Diego.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=380}} ''Savo Island''{{'}}s aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 91, was traded for {{USS|Makin Island|CVE-93|2}}'s Composite Squadron (VC) 84.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=381}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n[[Image:CVE-78 Savo Island.jpg|thumb|300px|USS ''Savo Island'' (CVE-78) photographed from the waterline, her flight deck full of aircraft, date and location unknown.]]\n\nAfter finishing overhaul, ''Savo Island'' began a transport mission from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, before transiting back to [[Alameda, California]], on the West Coast. On 6 August, she departed for the [[Aleutian Islands]], arriving on 15 August, right as the [[Surrender of Japan]] was announced. On 31 August, she headed, along with six other escort carriers, to support the [[Occupation of Japan]] in northern [[Honsh\u016b]] and [[Hokkaid\u014d]]. After finishing her duties, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 September, where she was assigned to the \"Magic Carpet\" fleet, which repatriated servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She first loaded occupation troops bound for Japan at [[San Francisco]], before heading west. ''Savo Island'' made a total of three \"Magic Carpet\" voyages, repatriating troops from [[Guam]], Pearl Harbor, and Okinawa, respectively. Upon arriving at [[Seattle]] on 14 January 1946, and finishing her final voyage, she transited to the Eastern seaboard, entering [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] harbor on 16 March for inactivation.{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n''Savo Island'' was decommissioned on 12 December, and [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]], as port of its Boston group. Docked at the [[South Boston Naval Annex]], she was reclassified as a helicopter escort carrier ('''CVHE-78''') on 12 June 1955. She was then further reclassified as an aviation transport ('''AKV-28''') on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy list]] on 1 September 1959, and she was sold on 29 February 1960 to Comarket Inc., which [[Ship breaking|broke]] her up in [[Hong Kong]] throughout June 1960.{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}}\n''Savo Island'' received 4 [[battle star]]s for her World War II service.

She was named after the [[Battle of Savo Island]], to memorialize American casualties during the Japanese Navy's decisive victory in the [[Battle of Savo Island]], fought in support of the [[Guadalcanal campaign]]. Built for service during [[World War II]], the ship was launched in December 1943, commissioned in February 1944, and served as a frontline carrier throughout the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]] and the [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Philippines campaign]]. During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], she provided air cover for the replenishment carrier fleet. Postwar, she participated in [[Operation Magic Carpet]]. She was decommissioned in December 1946, when she was [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]]. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in February 1960.\n\n==Design and description==\n[[File:Inboard and outboard profiles of a Casablanca-class escort carrier, 1946.png|thumb|left|A profile of the design of {{USS|Takanis Bay|CVE-89|2}}, which was shared with all ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers.]]\n{{main|Casablanca-class escort carrier}}\n''Savo Island'' was a ''Casablanca''-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of [[aircraft carrier]]s ever built,{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}} and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her [[sister ship]]s, she was {{convert|512|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]], had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|65|ft|2|in|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{convert|20|ft|9|in|abbr=on}}. She [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|8188|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|standard]], {{cvt|10902|LT}} with a [[Full-load displacement|full load]]. She had a {{convert|257|ft|abbr=on}} long [[Hangar#Hangars aboard ships|hangar deck]] and a {{convert|477|ft|abbr=on}} long [[flight deck]]. She was powered with two [[Skinner Unaflow]] reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing {{convert|9000|hp|lk=in}}, thus enabling her to make {{Casablanca class speed}}. The ship had a cruising range of {{convert|10240|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|15|kn}}. Her compact size necessitated the installment of an [[aircraft catapult]] at her bow, and there were two [[Elevator#Elevators for aircraft|aircraft elevators]] to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}}{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}}\n\nOne [[5\"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|0|adj=on}}/38]] [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[dual-purpose gun]] was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by 8 [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} anti-aircraft guns]] in single mounts, as well as 12 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon {{convert|20|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} cannon]]s, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck.{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}} By the end of the war, ''Casablanca''-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to [[kamikaze]] attacks. ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]], she carried 16 [[Grumman F4F Wildcat#FM-1/-2 Wildcat|FM-2]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], and 12 [[Grumman TBF Avenger#TBM|TBM-1C]] [[torpedo bomber]]s, for a total of 28 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=109}} During the [[Battle off Samar]], she carried 17 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 29 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=121}} During the [[Battle of Mindoro]], she carried 24 FM-2 fighters and 9 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 33 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=251}} During the [[Battle of Lingayen Gulf]], she carried 19 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 31 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=277}} During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=349}}\n\n==Construction==\nHer construction was awarded to [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser Shipbuilding Company]], [[Vancouver, Washington]] under a [[Maritime Commission]] contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 27 September 1943 under the name ''Kaita Bay'', as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska.{{sfn|Maksel|2012}} She was laid down as MC hull 1115, the twenty-third of a series of fifty ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers. She was renamed ''Savo Island'' on 6 November 1943, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent ''Casablanca''-class carriers after naval or land engagements.{{sfn|Stubblebine|2011}} She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 22 December 1943; [[Ship sponsor|sponsored]] by Miss Margaret Taffinder; transferred to the United States Navy and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 February 1944, with [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] Clarence Eugene Ekstrom in command.{{sfn|Kaiser Vancouver|2010}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n==Service history==\nUpon being commissioned, ''Savo Island'' underwent a [[shakedown cruise]] down the West Coast to [[San Diego]], where she took on a load of replacement aircraft. Between 15 March 1944 and 2 July, she underwent two transport missions, ferrying aircraft to bases in the Southwest Pacific. On 6 July, she embarked Composite Squadron (VC) 27, which would be her aircraft contingent throughout the Marianas and Palau Islands campaign and the [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Philippines campaign of 1944\u201345]]. After a brief period of training off the waters of San Diego, she sailed west to [[Pearl Harbor]], where similar exercises were conducted. There, on 4 August, she was assigned to Task Group 32.7, the Western Escort Carrier Group, commanded by [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William Sample]], of the [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]], assigned to support the planned [[Battle of Peleliu|landings]] on the island of [[Peleliu]], of the [[Palau|Palau Islands]]. Her aircraft contingent began combat operations on 11 September, strafing and bombarding the island to soften up the defenses for the landings. Following the landing of [[United States Marine Corps|marines]], her aircraft transitioned into providing [[close air support]] and patrol missions, up until 30 September.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=109}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nOn 3 October, she was assigned to and joined Task Group 77.4, which was gathering at [[Manus Island]], part of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]].  She, accompanied with eighteen other escort carriers and their screens of [[battleships]], [[cruisers]], and [[destroyers]], steamed on 12 October for [[Leyte Gulf]], where they were expected to support the [[Battle of Leyte|landings]] on [[Leyte]], which marked the beginning of the Philippines campaign. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2, otherwise known as \"Taffy 2\", commanded by Rear Admiral [[Felix Stump]], she was positioned to the direct south of \"Taffy 3\", which was located to the direct east of the [[San Bernadino Strait]]. Arriving off the island on 18 October, her aircraft began carrying out naval patrols and strikes against predesignated targets. Once the [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] had landed on 20 October, her aircraft transitioned towards a focus on close air support, supporting the initial advances for the next few days.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=121}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nOn 23 October, the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] began. Almost the entirety of Japan's remaining surface fleet had been concentrated into a counterattack against the U.S. forces in the vicinity of the Philippines, which had threatened to cut off Japan's vital oil supply from Southeast Asia. Split into three groups, the Southern Force was defeated in the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], whilst [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[William Halsey Jr.]] sent the Third Fleet in an attack against the diversionary Northern Force. Therefore, the escort carriers which continued providing ground support had no capital ship screening, even as Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Center Force drove through the San Bernadino Strait during the night.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=148}} On the early morning of 25 October, the Center Force emerged into the waters of the Leyte Gulf, catching Taffy 3, some {{cvt|20|mi}} north of ''Savo Island'', by surprise.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=153}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nAs the American command came to an understanding of the severity of the situation, with the Center Force consisting of four battleships, six cruisers, and a large destroyer screen, the entirety of Taffy 2's aircraft were recalled to join the defense. ''Savo Island''{{'}}s fighters and torpedo bombers were not equipped to attack surface ships, with most of her bombers being loaded with [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]] and missiles for ground attacks.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=196}} Nonetheless, aircraft from ''Savo Island''{{'}}s VC-27 were amongst Taffy 2's first wave of strikes, launched at 7:37 in the morning. Some of the destroyers within Taffy 2's screen wandered north, before being confronted with some Japanese naval gunfire and being ordered to withdraw towards the escort carriers. Overall, ''Savo Island'' launched six strikes against the Japanese forces, with her aircraft notably landing a torpedo hit on a Japanese battleship and shooting down an [[Aichi E13A]] [[reconnaissance]] [[seaplane]] caught in the middle of the action.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=221}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nDiscouraged by the stiff resistance his Center Force had faced, including the loss of three cruisers, Admiral Kurita issued orders to withdraw in the late morning, sparing Taffy 3 from further destruction. As the Japanese forces withdrew, fighters from ''Savo Island'' took the opportunity to down four more Japanese planes.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=225}} Nonetheless, the escort carriers underwent concentrated Japanese attack again in the afternoon, this time from the air, including some of the first usage of [[kamikaze]] suicide attacks. The carrier continued supporting ground operations until 30 October, when Taffy 2 was reorganized into Task Unit 77.4.4, and ordered to withdraw back to Manus Island to rearm and replenish.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=241}} She sortied from Manus on 19 November, providing cover for convoys proceeding to Leyte Gulf from 22 November to 27 November, accompanied by two other escort carriers. Upon completing this task, she replenished at [[Kossol Roads]], before she left on 10 December, this time in support of the [[Battle of Mindoro|landings]] on the island of [[Mindoro]]. Her aircraft provided air cover as the landing crafts unloaded their troops, and provided close air support as they advanced. They also targeted air fields, from which kamikaze aircraft were beginning to make regular forays. The escort carriers were relieved by Army aircraft on 15 December, but she stayed offshore until 17 December because of indications of a Japanese surface raid, which never materialized. On 17 December, she steamed back to Manus Island.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=264}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n[[File:SavoIslandSuluSea.jpg|thumb|left|''Savo Island'' underway in the Sulu Sea, photographed from the battleship {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}}.]]\nAt Manus Island, ''Savo Island'' was assigned to Task Unit 77.4.2., the San Fabian Carrier Group.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=277}} On 27 December, the carriers, escorted by a large surface fleet, left Manus bound for [[Lingayen Gulf]], to the west of [[Luzon]]. There, the carriers would support the [[Sixth United States Army|6th Army]] [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|landings]] on Luzon. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2., ''Savo Island'' would provide air support and cover for the [[I Corps (United States)|I Army Corps]], which would land around the [[San Fabian, Pangasinan|San Fabian]] area. Pausing at [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]], the carriers entered the [[Sulu Sea]] on 3 January 1945, where they began being harried by aircraft, circling around on radar. Japanese planes continued appearing around the periphery of the American forces throughout 4 January, but it was not until 17:00 in the evening that the Japanese forces coalesced into a [[kamikaze]] strike, attacking at 17:12, achieving complete surprise, and sinking {{USS|Ommaney Bay|CVE-79|2}}.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=281}} \n\nThe following day, on 5 January, the kamikazes returned. At 17:43 in the evening, the [[battleship]] {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|2}} reported planes approaching from her starboard bow, and shortly afterwards, {{USS|Manila Bay|CVE-61|2}} had been hit by two kamikazes, heavily damaging the ship. A few minutes after the attack on ''Manila Bay'', a [[Nakajima Ki-43]] kamikaze dove towards ''Savo Island''. Engaged by several anti-aircraft batteries, the plane being trailing smoke some {{cvt|800|yds}} away from the carrier. As a reaction, ''Savo Island'' turned hard to starboard, whilst its {{cvt|24|in}} searchlight was pointed at the aircraft to try to blind the pilot. The plane, moving erratically, passed between the carrier's mast and the whip antenna, shearing off the carrier's radar antenna, before diving into the sea.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=295}}\n\nOn 6 January, the carriers proceeded into Lingayen Gulf, and started a heavy bombardment of Japanese defenses, flying 5,971 sorties in eleven days. On 9 January, the 6th Army moved onshore, encountering little resistance. ''Savo Island'' remained on station until 17 January, when the [[United States Air Force]] took over air operations on Luzon.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=316}}  She then proceeded south to operate to the northwest of Mindoro, to guard against any counterattacks on the American garrisons situated throughout the Northern Philippines, staying on station from 17 January until 29 January. During this period, on 19 January, Captain William Donald Anderson took command of the ship. Upon completing her patrols, she then provided cover for landings near [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] on 29 and 30 January, before retiring to [[Ulithi]] for repairs and replenishment. There, her aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 27, was replaced with Composite Squadron 91, which had previously served upon {{USS|Kitkun Bay|CVE-71|2}}. Upon receiving replacement pilots, she began a brief period of training exercises, before being assigned to Task Unit 52.1.1, in preparation for the [[Battle of Okinawa]].{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=349}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}} \n\nTransiting via Leyte, her aircraft provided air cover and patrols en route. On 26 March, along with two other escort carriers, she supported the [[77th Sustainment Brigade|77th Infantry Division]] as it occupied the [[Kerama Islands]]. On 27 March, she began bombing the main island of [[Okinawa]], with her fighters flying antiaircraft and antisubmarine patrols. On 7 April, the carrier left Task Unit 52.1.1., trading places with {{USS|Shamrock Bay|CVE-84|2}}, part of Task Group 50.8, the Logistics Support Group.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=363}} Therefore, from 7 to 16 April, she screened a replenishment convoy proceeding to the east of Okinawa. Upon the completion of that task, she continued providing close air support for American forces advancing down Okinawa. On 27 April, her aircraft bombed [[Sakishima Gunto]], an island situated halfway between Okinawa and [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. On 29 April, ''Savo Island'', along with {{USS|Marcus Island|CVE-77|2}} and {{USS|Saginaw Bay|CVE-82|2}}, were discharged from their task group, all sailing for overhaul in San Diego.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=380}} ''Savo Island''{{'}}s aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 91, was traded for {{USS|Makin Island|CVE-93|2}}'s Composite Squadron (VC) 84.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=381}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n[[Image:CVE-78 Savo Island.jpg|thumb|300px|USS ''Savo Island'' (CVE-78) photographed from the waterline, her flight deck full of aircraft, date and location unknown.]]\n\nAfter finishing overhaul, ''Savo Island'' began a transport mission from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, before transiting back to [[Alameda, California]], on the West Coast. On 6 August, she departed for the [[Aleutian Islands]], arriving on 15 August, right as the [[Surrender of Japan]] was announced. On 31 August, she headed, along with six other escort carriers, to support the [[Occupation of Japan]] in northern [[Honsh\u016b]] and [[Hokkaid\u014d]]. After finishing her duties, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 September, where she was assigned to the \"Magic Carpet\" fleet, which repatriated servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She first loaded occupation troops bound for Japan at [[San Francisco]], before heading west. ''Savo Island'' made a total of three \"Magic Carpet\" voyages, repatriating troops from [[Guam]], Pearl Harbor, and Okinawa, respectively. Upon arriving at [[Seattle]] on 14 January 1946, and finishing her final voyage, she transited to the Eastern seaboard, entering [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] harbor on 16 March for inactivation.{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n''Savo Island'' was decommissioned on 12 December, and [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]], as port of its Boston group. Docked at the [[South Boston Naval Annex]], she was reclassified as a helicopter escort carrier ('''CVHE-78''') on 12 June 1955. She was then further reclassified as an aviation transport ('''AKV-28''') on 7 May 1959.

They are often called hieroglyphs due to the iconic shapes of many of the glyphs, a pattern superficially similar to [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Fifteen examples of distinct writing systems have been identified in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, many from a single inscription.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Macri |first1=Martha J. |title=\"Maya and Other Mesoamerican Scripts,\" in The World's Writing Systems |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford |location=England |pages=172\u2013182}}</ref> The limits of archaeological dating methods make it difficult to establish which was the earliest and hence the fore-bearer from which the others developed. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and the most widely known, is the classic [[Maya script]]. An extensive [[Mesoamerican literature]] has been conserved partly in indigenous scripts and partly in the postconquest transcriptions in the [[Latin script]].\n\n== Olmec writing ==\n{{Main|Cascajal block}}\n\n[[File:Cascajal-text.svg|thumb|right|upright|The 62 glyphs of the [[Cascajal block]]]]\n\nEarly [[Olmec]] ceramics show representations of something that may be codices, suggesting that [[amatl]] bark codices, and by extension well-developed writing, existed in Olmec times.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} It was also long thought that many of the glyphs present on Olmec monumental sculpture, such as those on the so-called \"Ambassador Monument\" (La Venta Monument 13), represented an early Olmec script. This suspicion was reinforced in 2002 by the announcement of the discovery of [[San_Andr\u00e9s_(Mesoamerican_site)#Indications_of_an_Olmec_writing_system|similar glyphs]] at [[San Andres (Mesoamerican site)|San Andres]].<ref>https://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5600/1984/tab-figures-data</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, a report published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'' magazine]] announced the discovery of the [[Olmec hieroglyphs|Cascajal block]], a writing-tablet-sized block of [[Serpentinite|serpentine]] with 62 characters unlike any yet seen in Mesoamerica. This block was discovered by locals in the [[Olmec heartland]] and was dated by the archaeologists to approximately 900 [[Common Era|BCE]] based on other debris. If the authenticity and date can be verified, this will prove to be the earliest writing yet found in Mesoamerica.\n\n== Zapotec writing ==\n[[File:C\u00f3dice_Vindobonensis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Line 37 of the C\u00f3dice Vindobonensis or Yuta Tnoho]]\nAnother candidate for earliest writing system in Mesoamerica is the writing system of the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] culture. Rising in the late [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-Classic era]] after the decline of the Olmec civilization, the Zapotecs of present-day Oaxaca built an empire around [[Monte Alban]]. On a few monuments at this archaeological site, archaeologists have found extended text in a glyphic script. Some signs can be recognized as calendric information but the script as such remains undeciphered. Read in columns from top to bottom, its execution is somewhat cruder than that of the later Classic Maya and this has led epigraphers to believe that the script was also less phonetic than the largely syllabic Maya script. These are, however, speculations.\n\nThe earliest known monument with Zapotec writing is a \"Danzante\" stone, officially known as Monument 3, found in [[San Jose Mogote]], [[Oaxaca]]. It has a relief of what appears to be a dead and bloodied captive with two glyphic signs between his legs, probably representing his name. First dated to 500\u2013600 BCE, this was earlier considered the earliest writing in Mesoamerica. However doubts have been expressed as to this dating and the monument may have been reused. The Zapotec script went out of use only in the late Classic period.\n\n== Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script ==\n{{Main|Epi-Olmec script}}\n\n[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|right|Detail showing glyphs from 2nd century CE [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] currently located at the Museum of Anthropology of Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. The left column gives a Long Count date of 8.5.16.9.9, or 162 CE. The other columns are glyphs from the [[Epi-Olmec script]].]]\n\nA small number of artifacts found in the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] show examples of another early Mesoamerican writing system. They can be seen to contain calendric information but are otherwise undeciphered. The longest of these texts are on [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] and the [[Tuxtla Statuette]]. The writing system used is very close to the Maya script, using affixal glyphs and Long Count dates, but is read only in one column at a time as is the Zapotec script. It has been suggested that this Isthmian or [[Epi-Olmec script]] is the direct predecessor of the Maya script, thus giving the Maya script a non-Maya origin. Another artifact with Epi-Olmec script is the Chiapa de Corzo stela which is the oldest monument of the Americas inscribed with its own date: the [[Maya calendar#Long Count|Long Count]] on the stela dates it to 36 BCE.\n\nIn a 1997 paper, John Justeson and Terrence Kaufman put forward a decipherment of Epi-Olmec. The following year, however, their interpretation was disputed by Stephen Houston and [[Michael D. Coe]], who unsuccessfully applied Justeson and Kaufman's decipherment system against epi-Olmec script from the back of a hitherto unknown mask. The matter remains under dispute.\n\n== Abaj Takalik and Kaminaljuy\u00fa scripts ==\n\nIn the highland Maya archaeological sites of [[Abaj Takalik]] and [[Kaminaljuy\u00fa]] writing has been found dating to [[Izapa]] culture. It is likely that in this area in late Pre-Classic times an ancient form of a [[Mixe\u2013Zoquean languages|Mixe\u2013Zoquean language]] was spoken, and the inscriptions found here may be in such a language rather than a Maya one. Some glyphs in this scripts are readable as they are identical to Maya glyphs but the script remains undeciphered. The advanced decay and destruction of these archaeological sites make it improbable that more monuments with these scripts will come to light making possible a decipherment.\n\n== Maya Glyphs ==\n{{Main|Maya script}}\n\n[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|left|Maya glyphs in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], Mexico]]\n\nMaya writing is attested from the mid-preclassic period in the center of Pet\u00e9n in the Maya lowlands, and lately scholars have suggested that the earliest Maya inscriptions may in fact be the oldest of Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 200\u2013300 BCE. Early examples include the painted inscriptions at the caves of [[Naj Tunich]] and La Cobanerita in [[El Pet\u00e9n]], [[Guatemala]]. The most elaborate inscriptions are considered to be those at classic sites like [[Palenque]], [[Cop\u00e1n]] and [[Tikal]].\n\nThe [[Maya script]] is generally considered to be the most fully developed Mesoamerican writing system. Mainly because of its extraordinary aesthetics and because it has been partially deciphered. In Maya writing, logograms and syllable signs are combined. Around 700 different glyphs have been documented, with some 75% having been deciphered. Around 7000 texts in Maya script have been documented.\n\nMaya writing first developed as only utilizing logograms, but later included the use of phonetic complements in order to differentiate between the semantic meanings of the logograms and for context that allows for syllabic spelling of words.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=L. |last2=Kaufman |first2=T. |date=1985 |title=Maya Linguistics: Where Are We Now? |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=187\u2013198 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.14.100185.001155}}</ref>\n\n== Mixtec writing ==\n{{Main|Mixtec writing}}\n[[File:Abaj_Takalik_Stela_5.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Stela 5 from Abaj Takalik]]\nThe Mixtec writing emerged during the 13th century, much later than the systems previously mentioned. Mixtec is a [[Semasiography|semasiographic]] system that was used by the pre-Hispanic [[Mixtec]]s. Many of its characteristics were later adopted by the Mexica and Mixteca-Puebla writing systems. The origin of the Mixteca-Puebla is the subject of debate amongst experts. The [[Mixtec writing|Mixtec writing system]] consisted of a set of figurative signs and symbols that served as guides for storytellers as they recounted legends. These storytellers were usually priests and other members of the Mixtec upper class.\n\nMixtec writing has been categorized as being a mixture of pictorial and logographic, rather than a complete logogram system.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kubler |first=George |date=1974 |title=Review of Picture Writing from Ancient Southern Mexico: Mixtec Place Signs and Maps |jstor=674740 |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=670\u2013672 |doi=10.1525/aa.1974.76.3.02a00840}}</ref>\n\nMixtec writing has been preserved through various archaeological artifacts that have survived the passage of time and the destruction of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pohl |first=John M.

Instead, the codices that have been preserved record historical events of this pre-Columbian people, especially those events related to expansionism in the era of [[Eight Deer Jaguar Claw|Ocho Venado]], lord of [[Tilantongo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Esplendor de la antigua Mixteca |last=L\u00f3pez Ramos |first=Juan Arturo |publisher=Editorial Trillas |year=1987 |isbn=968-24-2613-8 |location=M\u00e9xico |pages=99\u2013109}}</ref>\n\n== Other potential Mesoamerican writing systems ==\n\nTwo other potential writing systems have been found in Mesoamerica. The Tlatilco cylinder seal was found during the time frame of the Olmec occupation of Tlatilco, and appears to contain a non-pictographic script. The Chiapa de Corzo cylinder seal found at that location in Mexico also appears to be an example of an unknown Mesoamerican script.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kelley |first1=David H. |title=A Cylinder Seal from Tlatilco |journal=American Antiquity |date=1966 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=744\u201346|doi=10.2307/2694503 |jstor=2694503}}</ref>\n\n== Writing in post-classic cultures ==\n[[File:aztlan codex boturini.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of first page from the Aztec ''Boturini Codex'', showing the use of semasiological writing combined with phonetic glyph elements.]]\n\nAfter the collapse of the classic Maya civilization, the Maya glyphic system continued to be used, but much less so. Post-classic inscriptions are found at the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula in sites such as [[Chich\u00e9n Itza]] and [[Uxmal]] but the style is not nearly as accomplished as the classic Maya inscriptions. Other post-classic cultures such as the [[Aztec codices|Aztec]] did not have fully developed writing systems, but instead used [[semasiographic]] writing although they have been said to be slowly developing phonetic principles in [[Aztec writing|their writing]] by the use of the [[rebus]] principle. [[Aztec]] name glyphs, for example, do combine logographic elements with phonetic readings.\n\n== Post-Columbian era ==\nWhen Europeans arrived in the 16th century, they found a writing system in use that drew from Olmec, Zapotec, and Teotihuacano traditions.<ref>Robert T.

They are often called hieroglyphs due to the iconic shapes of many of the glyphs, a pattern superficially similar to [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Fifteen examples of distinct writing systems have been identified in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, many from a single inscription.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Macri |first1=Martha J. |title=\"Maya and Other Mesoamerican Scripts,\" in The World's Writing Systems |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford |location=England |pages=172\u2013182}}</ref> The limits of archaeological dating methods make it difficult to establish which was the earliest and hence the fore-bearer from which the others developed. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and the most widely known, is the classic [[Maya script]]. An extensive [[Mesoamerican literature]] has been conserved partly in indigenous scripts and partly in the postconquest transcriptions in the [[Latin script]].\n\n== Olmec writing ==\n{{Main|Cascajal block}}\n\n[[File:Cascajal-text.svg|thumb|right|upright|The 62 glyphs of the [[Cascajal block]]]]\n\nEarly [[Olmec]] ceramics show representations of something that may be codices, suggesting that [[amatl]] bark codices, and by extension well-developed writing, existed in Olmec times.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} It was also long thought that many of the glyphs present on Olmec monumental sculpture, such as those on the so-called \"Ambassador Monument\" (La Venta Monument 13), represented an early Olmec script. This suspicion was reinforced in 2002 by the announcement of the discovery of [[San_Andr\u00e9s_(Mesoamerican_site)#Indications_of_an_Olmec_writing_system|similar glyphs]] at [[San Andres (Mesoamerican site)|San Andres]].<ref>https://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5600/1984/tab-figures-data</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, a report published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'' magazine]] announced the discovery of the [[Olmec hieroglyphs|Cascajal block]], a writing-tablet-sized block of [[Serpentinite|serpentine]] with 62 characters unlike any yet seen in Mesoamerica. This block was discovered by locals in the [[Olmec heartland]] and was dated by the archaeologists to approximately 900 [[Common Era|BCE]] based on other debris. If the authenticity and date can be verified, this will prove to be the earliest writing yet found in Mesoamerica.\n\n== Zapotec writing ==\n[[File:C\u00f3dice_Vindobonensis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Line 37 of the C\u00f3dice Vindobonensis or Yuta Tnoho]]\nAnother candidate for earliest writing system in Mesoamerica is the writing system of the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] culture. Rising in the late [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-Classic era]] after the decline of the Olmec civilization, the Zapotecs of present-day Oaxaca built an empire around [[Monte Alban]]. On a few monuments at this archaeological site, archaeologists have found extended text in a glyphic script. Some signs can be recognized as calendric information but the script as such remains undeciphered. Read in columns from top to bottom, its execution is somewhat cruder than that of the later Classic Maya and this has led epigraphers to believe that the script was also less phonetic than the largely syllabic Maya script. These are, however, speculations.\n\nThe earliest known monument with Zapotec writing is a \"Danzante\" stone, officially known as Monument 3, found in [[San Jose Mogote]], [[Oaxaca]]. It has a relief of what appears to be a dead and bloodied captive with two glyphic signs between his legs, probably representing his name. First dated to 500\u2013600 BCE, this was earlier considered the earliest writing in Mesoamerica. However doubts have been expressed as to this dating and the monument may have been reused. The Zapotec script went out of use only in the late Classic period.\n\n== Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script ==\n{{Main|Epi-Olmec script}}\n\n[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|right|Detail showing glyphs from 2nd century CE [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] currently located at the Museum of Anthropology of Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. The left column gives a Long Count date of 8.5.16.9.9, or 162 CE. The other columns are glyphs from the [[Epi-Olmec script]].]]\n\nA small number of artifacts found in the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] show examples of another early Mesoamerican writing system. They can be seen to contain calendric information but are otherwise undeciphered. The longest of these texts are on [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] and the [[Tuxtla Statuette]]. The writing system used is very close to the Maya script, using affixal glyphs and Long Count dates, but is read only in one column at a time as is the Zapotec script. It has been suggested that this Isthmian or [[Epi-Olmec script]] is the direct predecessor of the Maya script, thus giving the Maya script a non-Maya origin. Another artifact with Epi-Olmec script is the Chiapa de Corzo stela which is the oldest monument of the Americas inscribed with its own date: the [[Maya calendar#Long Count|Long Count]] on the stela dates it to 36 BCE.\n\nIn a 1997 paper, John Justeson and Terrence Kaufman put forward a decipherment of Epi-Olmec. The following year, however, their interpretation was disputed by Stephen Houston and [[Michael D. Coe]], who unsuccessfully applied Justeson and Kaufman's decipherment system against epi-Olmec script from the back of a hitherto unknown mask. The matter remains under dispute.\n\n== Abaj Takalik and Kaminaljuy\u00fa scripts ==\n\nIn the highland Maya archaeological sites of [[Abaj Takalik]] and [[Kaminaljuy\u00fa]] writing has been found dating to [[Izapa]] culture. It is likely that in this area in late Pre-Classic times an ancient form of a [[Mixe\u2013Zoquean languages|Mixe\u2013Zoquean language]] was spoken, and the inscriptions found here may be in such a language rather than a Maya one. Some glyphs in this scripts are readable as they are identical to Maya glyphs but the script remains undeciphered. The advanced decay and destruction of these archaeological sites make it improbable that more monuments with these scripts will come to light making possible a decipherment.\n\n== Maya writing ==\n{{Main|Maya script}}\n\n[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|left|Maya glyphs in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], Mexico]]\n\nMaya writing is attested from the mid-preclassic period in the center of Pet\u00e9n in the Maya lowlands, and lately scholars have suggested that the earliest Maya inscriptions may in fact be the oldest of Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 200\u2013300 BCE. Early examples include the painted inscriptions at the caves of [[Naj Tunich]] and La Cobanerita in [[El Pet\u00e9n]], [[Guatemala]]. The most elaborate inscriptions are considered to be those at classic sites like [[Palenque]], [[Cop\u00e1n]] and [[Tikal]].\n\nThe [[Maya script]] is generally considered to be the most fully developed Mesoamerican writing system. Mainly because of its extraordinary aesthetics and because it has been partially deciphered. In Maya writing, logograms and syllable signs are combined. Around 700 different glyphs have been documented, with some 75% having been deciphered. Around 7000 texts in Maya script have been documented.\n\nMaya writing first developed as only utilizing logograms, but later included the use of phonetic complements in order to differentiate between the semantic meanings of the logograms and for context that allows for syllabic spelling of words.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=L. |last2=Kaufman |first2=T. |date=1985 |title=Maya Linguistics: Where Are We Now? |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=187\u2013198 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.14.100185.001155}}</ref>\n\n== Mixtec writing ==\n{{Main|Mixtec writing}}\n[[File:Abaj_Takalik_Stela_5.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Stela 5 from Abaj Takalik]]\nThe Mixtec writing emerged during the 13th century, much later than the systems previously mentioned. Mixtec is a [[Semasiography|semasiographic]] system that was used by the pre-Hispanic [[Mixtec]]s. Many of its characteristics were later adopted by the Mexica and Mixteca-Puebla writing systems. The origin of the Mixteca-Puebla is the subject of debate amongst experts. The [[Mixtec writing|Mixtec writing system]] consisted of a set of figurative signs and symbols that served as guides for storytellers as they recounted legends. These storytellers were usually priests and other members of the Mixtec upper class.\n\nMixtec writing has been categorized as being a mixture of pictorial and logographic, rather than a complete logogram system.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kubler |first=George |date=1974 |title=Review of Picture Writing from Ancient Southern Mexico: Mixtec Place Signs and Maps |jstor=674740 |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=670\u2013672 |doi=10.1525/aa.1974.76.3.02a00840}}</ref>\n\nMixtec writing has been preserved through various archaeological artifacts that have survived the passage of time and the destruction of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pohl |first=John M.

These codices are read in [[boustrophedon]], a zigzag style in which the reader follows red lines that indicate the way to read.<ref>{{cite book |title=Huisi Tacu.

Instead, the codices that have been preserved record historical events of this pre-Columbian people, especially those events related to expansionism in the era of [[Eight Deer Jaguar Claw|Ocho Venado]], lord of [[Tilantongo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Esplendor de la antigua Mixteca |last=L\u00f3pez Ramos |first=Juan Arturo |publisher=Editorial Trillas |year=1987 |isbn=968-24-2613-8 |location=M\u00e9xico |pages=99\u2013109}}</ref>\n\n== Other potential Mesoamerican writing systems ==\n\nTwo other potential writing systems have been found in Mesoamerica. The Tlatilco cylinder seal was found during the time frame of the Olmec occupation of Tlatilco, and appears to contain a non-pictographic script. The Chiapa de Corzo cylinder seal found at that location in Mexico also appears to be an example of an unknown Mesoamerican script.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kelley |first1=David H. |title=A Cylinder Seal from Tlatilco |journal=American Antiquity |date=1966 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=744\u201346|doi=10.2307/2694503 |jstor=2694503}}</ref>\n\n== Writing in post-classic cultures ==\n[[File:aztlan codex boturini.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of first page from the Aztec ''Boturini Codex'', showing the use of semasiological writing combined with phonetic glyph elements.]]\n\nAfter the collapse of the classic Maya civilization, the Maya glyphic system continued to be used, but much less so. Post-classic inscriptions are found at the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula in sites such as [[Chich\u00e9n Itza]] and [[Uxmal]] but the style is not nearly as accomplished as the classic Maya inscriptions. Other post-classic cultures such as the [[Aztec codices|Aztec]] did not have fully developed writing systems, but instead used [[semasiographic]] writing although they have been said to be slowly developing phonetic principles in [[Aztec writing|their writing]] by the use of the [[rebus]] principle. [[Aztec]] name glyphs, for example, do combine logographic elements with phonetic readings.\n\n== Post-Columbian era ==\nWhen Europeans arrived in the 16th century, they found a writing system in use that drew from Olmec, Zapotec, and Teotihuacano traditions.<ref>Robert T.
