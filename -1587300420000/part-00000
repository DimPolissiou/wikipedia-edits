In Arizona, it is often found on open slopes among scattered [[Quercus emoryi|Emory oak]], [[Quercus arizonica|Arizona oak]], [[Juniperus deppeana|alligator juniper]], [[yucca]], [[agave]], [[mimosa]], [[sugar sumac]], [[Opuntia|prickly pear]], and [[Dasylirion wheeleri|desert spoon]]. These plants often have long foliage growing at their bases, and the cotton rat uses these for cover.

In these habitats, it makes runs between the clumps of grass, but in sparsely vegetated areas, these runways are difficult to discern. It is primarily active during the day, moving fast along its runways so as to be exposed to [[predation]] for as little time as possible. It feeds primarily on [[Bouteloua gracilis|blue grama grass]] (''Bouteloua gracilis''), but also the green parts of other plants such as [[muhly]], [[three-leaf groundsel]], [[gumweed]], and [[three-awn tangle-head]], and less frequently on seeds and fruits.<ref name=Hoffmeister/> It cuts sections of grasses and forms small piles of grass blades on the surface and [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|caches]] further piles of dried foliage underground, often in the abandoned burrows of southern pocket gophers.<ref name=Baker/>\n\n==Status==\nThe yellow-nosed cotton rat has a wide range and is common in parts of that range.
