Yeoh then served as a lawyer in Petaling Jaya for three years before moving to the ceremony management company in 2006.\n\n==Political career==\nDriven by Edward Ling, her schoolmate, to join the world of politics, both Yeoh and Ling joined the Damansara [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) Branch in the late 2006. Yeoh opted to join the DAP even though the party was an opposition party as she felt that the stand of the political party is the most consistent, though its leaders are often threatened by the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] which allows for arrest without any trial.\n\nInspired by [[Tony Pua]], Damansara Branch Chairman, who resigned to join DAP full-time, Yeoh followed Pua's footsteps and resigned shortly before the March 2008 general election to devote her full-time as a politician.\n\nYeoh was elected as the Selangor state assemblyperson for the seat of Subang Jaya in the [[2008 Malaysian general election|2008 general election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/community/2008/03/10/billi-takes-defeat-in-his-stride/|title=Billi takes defeat in his stride|date=10 March 2008|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|publisher=Star Publications|accessdate=27 May 2010}}</ref><ref>Lourdes, Mark.

She questioned the methods of how MCA managed to purchase the land under market price.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/14648/|title=DAP wants MCA to explain Petaling Jaya land buy {{!}} The Malaysian Insight|website=www.themalaysianinsight.com|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref> When the former [[Petaling Jaya Utara (federal constituency)|Petaling Jaya Utara]] MP, [[Chew Mei Fun]] of MCA was contacted on the matter, she denied being involved in the land application and declined to explain further.\n\nAfter the case was exposed to public knowledge, three MCA leaders - MCA Selangor Vice Chairperson Tang Song Chang, Chew and current MCA PJU division chief Tan Gim Tuan came forward to justify that the 1acre plot of land bought under market price will be used for public service. Yeo refuted this claim, explaining that if the land was actually for public service, then there would be no need for MCA to own the land as public service lands should be owned by the state government. Yeo also requested for proof or guarantee that MCA intended the land to be used for public service, and also further questioned the reason MCA applied for the land to be rezoned and converted from a \"water body\" to \"commercial land\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2017/09/29/yeo-to-mca-pj-land-to-be-used-for-public-services-really/|title=Yeo to MCA: PJ land to be used for public services \u2013 really?|date=2017-09-29|work=Free Malaysia Today|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref>\n\nChew later threatened to sue Yeo and/or the DAP Member of Parliament for Petaling Jaya Utara then, [[Tony Pua]], to which the DAP leaders openly welcomed, holding on to their standing that they had not done anything defamatory towards Chew or the MCA by revealing truthful facts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/395678|title=Feel free to sue us, DAP reps tell MCA veep|date=2017-09-19|work=Malaysiakini|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Charity works===\nYeo's office runs two tuition centres in Damansara Bistari and Kampung Chempaka, which offer free classes for students between the ages of 7 to 17 from low-income families.<ref>{{Citation|last=ZAP Film|title=Pusat Tuisyen Rakyat Selangor|date=2016-07-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O834h1grhms|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> She also runs a monthly [[food bank]] program providing basic necessities assistance to more than 100 people.\n\nShe also works with DAP's Impian Malaysia movement, being one of the pioneers of the first Impian Sarawak project in Kampung Sait, [[Sarawak]] which works to provide basic infrastructure such as roads, water, and electricity in Sarawak.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/03/15/real-change-means-working-on-the-impossible/|title=Real change means working on the impossible|author=Mikha Chan|publisher=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|date=15 March 2016|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nShe is the founder of LEAP (Leadership, Education, Activism and Politics), which aims to educate students on the political process and activism in Malaysia, such as the formation of political parties, [[election campaign]]s, constituency management, media relations, coalition formation and debates.<ref name=\"academic\"/>\n\nShe is also the founder of the Lawatan Anak Muda (LAM) Programme which allows young participants to visit the Malaysian Parliament and the Selangor State Assembly.

Of mixed parentage, including [[Muscogee people|Creek]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[African American]], and English, he was considered born to his mother's people in the Creek [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] system. He was reared by her in the Creek tradition. When he was a child, they migrated to Florida with other [[Red Stick]] refugees after their group's defeat in 1814 in the [[Creek Wars]]. There they became part of what was known as the Seminole people.\n\nIn 1836, Osceola led a small group of warriors in the Seminole resistance during the [[Second Seminole War]], when the United States tried to [[Indian Removal|remove]] the tribe from their lands in [[Florida Territory|Florida]] to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. He became an adviser to [[Micanopy]], the principal chief of the Seminole from 1825 to 1849.<ref name=myths>[http://tfn.net/~cdk901/osceola.htm \"Osceola, the Man and the Myths\"], retrieved January 11, 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202105713/http://tfn.net/~cdk901/osceola.htm |date=December 2, 2006 }}</ref> Osceola led the Seminole resistance to [[Indian Removal|removal]] until he was captured on October 21, 1837, by deception, under a flag of truce,<ref>Mahon, John K.

The village is a city now known as [[Tallassee, Alabama]], which Is located on the banks of the Tallapoosa River about twenty miles upstream from Fort Toulouse where the Tallapoosa and the Coosa Rivers meet to form the Alabama River. The inhabitants of the original Talisi village and of the current city of Tallassee were a mixture of all races. The Creek were among the Southeastern Native Americans who held slaves. Powell was believed to have ancestors from all of these groups.<ref name=\"Shapiro2000\">{{cite web|author1=Phyllis Shapiro|title=Myths and Dreams: Exploring the Cultural Legacies of Florida and the Caribbean|url=http://www.kislakfoundation.org/millennium-exhibit/profiles6.htm|website=kislakfoundation.org|publisher=Jay I.

Because the Creek had a [[matrilineal]] kinship system, Polly and Ann's children were all considered to be born into their mother's [[clan]]; they were reared by their mothers and their maternal male relatives as traditional Creek and gained their social status from their mother's people. Ann McQueen was also mixed-race Creek; her father, James McQueen, was Scottish. Ann was probably the sister or aunt of [[Peter McQueen]], a prominent Creek leader and warrior.

He was buried in 1811 at the Indian cemetery in [[Franklin, Alabama]], near a Methodist Missionary Church for the Creek.<ref>Hatch 2012, p. 8</ref>\n\nIn 1814, after the Red Stick Creek were defeated by United States forces, Polly took Osceola and moved with other Creek refugees from Alabama to Florida, where they joined the Seminole. In adulthood, as part of the Seminole, Powell was given his name ''Osceola'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0252|s|i\u02d0|\u02c8|o\u028a|l|\u0259}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|o\u028a|s|e\u026a|\u02c8|o\u028a|l|\u0259}}).

After early military skirmishes and the signing of the 1823 [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]], by which the US seized the northern Seminole lands, Osceola and his family moved with the Seminole deeper into the unpopulated wilds of central and southern Florida.<ref>Hatch 2012, pp. 55\u201358</ref>\n\nAs an adult, Osceola took two wives, as did some other high-ranking Creek and Seminole leaders. With them, he had at least five children.

In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]], by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Indian Territory]]. According to legend, Osceola stabbed the treaty with his knife, although there are no contemporary reports of this.<ref>Hatch 2012, pp. 87\u201389</ref> Donald L. Fixico, an American Indian historian, says he made a research trip to the National Archives to see the original Treaty of Fort Gibson (also known as the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]]), and that upon close inspection, he observed that it had \"a small triangular hole shaped like the point of a knife blade\".<ref name=\"Fixico2017\">{{cite book|author=Donald L.

In retaliation, the US Indian agent, [[Wiley Thompson]], declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]], who were forbidden by law to carry arms.<ref>Hatch 2012, pp. 82\u201385</ref>\n\nThompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson, who had the warrior locked up at [[Fort King]] for two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson.<ref>Hatch 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nOn December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed the Indian agent. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, more than 100 troops, who were marching from [[Fort Brooke]] to Fort King. Americans called this event the [[Dade Massacre]]. These nearly simultaneous attacks catalyzed the [[Second Seminole War]] with the United States.<ref>Mishall, John and Mary Lou Mishall. 2004.

Of mixed parentage, including [[Muscogee people|Creek]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[African American]], and English, he was considered born to his mother's people in the Creek [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] system. He was reared by her in the Creek tradition. When he was a child, they migrated to Florida with other [[Red Stick]] refugees after their group's defeat in 1814 in the [[Creek Wars]]. There they became part of what was known as the Seminole people.\n\nIn 1836, Osceola led a small group of warriors in the Seminole resistance during the [[Second Seminole War]], when the United States tried to [[Indian Removal|remove]] the tribe from their lands in [[Florida Territory|Florida]] to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.

The village is a city now known as [[Tallassee, Alabama]], which Is located on the banks of the Tallapoosa River about twenty miles upstream from Fort Toulouse where the Tallapoosa and the Coosa Rivers meet to form the Alabama River. The inhabitants of the original Talisi village and of the current city of Tallassee were a mixture of all races. The Creek were among the Southeastern Native Americans who held slaves.

He was buried in 1811 at the Indian cemetery in [[Franklin, Alabama]], near a Methodist Missionary Church for the Creek.<ref>Hatch 2012, p. 8</ref>\n\nIn 1814, after the Red Stick Creek were defeated by United States forces, Polly took Osceola and moved with other Creek refugees from Alabama to Florida, where they joined the Seminole. In adulthood, as part of the Seminole, Powell was given his name ''Osceola'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0252|s|i\u02d0|\u02c8|o\u028a|l|\u0259}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|o\u028a|s|e\u026a|\u02c8|o\u028a|l|\u0259}}).

With them, he had at least five children.

In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]], by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Indian Territory]].

In retaliation, the US Indian agent, [[Wiley Thompson]], declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]], who were forbidden by law to carry arms.<ref>Hatch 2012, pp. 82\u201385</ref>\n\nThompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson, who had the warrior locked up at [[Fort King]] for two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson.<ref>Hatch 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nOn December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed the Indian agent. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, more than 100 troops, who were marching from [[Fort Brooke]] to Fort King. Americans called this event the [[Dade Massacre]]. These nearly simultaneous attacks catalyzed the [[Second Seminole War]] with the United States.<ref>Mishall, John and Mary Lou Mishall. 2004.

The process of \"pulling\" the first mold, which was soon displayed in the window of a Charleston drugstore, destroyed the original cast.<ref>Wickman 2006, p. 178</ref> Weedon apparently preserved Osceola's head in a large jar of alcohol and took it to St. Augustine,<ref>Wickman 2006, p. 181</ref> where he exhibited it in the family drugstore.<ref>Wickman 2006, p. 187</ref>\n\nCaptain Pitcairn Morrison sent the death mask and some other objects collected by Weedon to an army officer in Washington. By 1885, the death mask and some of Osceola's belongings were being held in the anthropology collection of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The death mask is currently housed in the Luce collection of the New-York Historical Society.<!--\"New-York\" with a hyphen is how it is spelled on the New-York Historical Society's website, as was the practice when the society was established.--> <ref name=\"NYHS2016\">{{cite web|title=Seminole Chief Osceola (1804-1838)|url=http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibit/seminole-chief-osceola-1804-1838|website=www.nyhistory.org|publisher=New-York Historical Society|accessdate=3 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603192119/http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibit/seminole-chief-osceola-1804-1838|archivedate=June 3, 2016|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, Miami businessman Otis W. Shriver claimed he had dug up Osceola's grave and put his bones into a bank vault to rebury them at a tourist site at the [[Rainbow Springs]]. Shriver traveled around the state in 1967 to gather support for his project. [[Archaeologists]] later proved that Shriver had dug up animal remains; Osceola's body was still in its coffin.\n\nIn 1979 the [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]] bought Osceola's [[bandolier]] and other personal items from a [[Sotheby's]] auction. Because of the chief's significance, over time some people have created forgeries of Osceola's belongings. Rumors persist that his embalmed head has been found in various locations.\n\n[[Image:WILLIAMS(1837) Florida - OSEOLA (Osceola).jpg|thumb|right|Osceola (1836 lithograph)]]\n[[Image:Osceola Kenney and Hall.jpeg|thumb|right|Osceola (1838 lithograph)]]\n\n==Related media==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2018}}\n* Literature related to Osceola*\n**''Osceola'' (1858) by [[Thomas Mayne Reid]].\n** ''In the Wilds of Florida: A Tale of Warfare and Hunting'' (1880) by William Henry G.
