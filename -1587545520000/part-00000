The bezant\u00e9e bordure indicates a connection to the ancient [[Earl of Cornwall|Earls of Cornwall]]]]\n'''Thomas Killigrew''' (7 February 1612 \u2013 19 March 1683) was an [[England|English]] [[dramatist]] and theatre manager. He was a witty, dissolute figure at the court of King [[Charles II of England]].\n\n==Life and work==\n\nKilligrew was one of twelve children of Sir [[Robert Killigrew]] of Hanworth, a courtier to [[James I of England|James I]], and his wife [[Mary Woodhouse|Mary n\u00e9e Woodhouse]]; he became a page to King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] at about the age of thirteen. According to [[Samuel Pepys]], the boy Killigrew used to volunteer as an extra, or \"devil,\" at the [[Red Bull Theatre]], so that he could see the plays for free. The young Killigrew had limited formal education; the Court and the playhouse were his schoolroom.\n\nKilligrew was present at the exorcism of the possessed nuns of [[Loudun possessions|Loudun]]. In 1635 he left a sceptical account of the proceedings.<ref>[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley, Aldous]] (1952) ''[[The Devils of Loudun]]''. New York: Harper</ref>\n\nBefore the [[English Civil War]], Killigrew wrote several plays\u2014[[tragicomedy|tragicomedies]] like ''Claracilla'' and ''The Prisoners'', as well as his most popular play, ''The Parson's Wedding'' (1637). The latter play has been criticized for its coarse humour; but it also contains prose readings of [[John Donne]]'s poetry to pique a literate audience.<ref>Keast, William R. (1950) \"Killigrew's Use of Donne in ''The Parson's Wedding''\" in: ''Modern Language Review'', 45 (1950), pp. 512-15</ref>\n\nA Royalist and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], Killigrew followed Prince Charles (the future [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]) into exile in 1647. In the years 1649-51, he was in [[Paris]], [[Geneva]], and [[Rome]], and in the later year was appointed Charles' representative in [[Venice]]. (It has been said that Killigrew wrote each of his plays in a different city; ''Thomaso, or the Wanderer'' was written in [[Madrid]])\n\nAt the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660, Killigrew returned to England along with many other Royalist exiles. Charles rewarded his loyalty by making him [[Groom of the Bedchamber]] and Chamberlain to Queen [[Catherine of Braganza|Catherine]]. He had a reputation as a wit; in his famous Diary, [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote that Killigrew had the office of the King's fool and jester, with privilege to mock and revile even the most prominent without penalty {{ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1668/February#13th|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', Thursday, 13 February 1668]]}}\n\nAlong with Sir [[William Davenant]], he was given a royal warrant to form a [[theatre]] company in 1660\u2014which gave Killigrew a key role in the revival of English drama. Killigrew beat Davenant to a debut, at [[Gibbon's Tennis Court]] in [[Clare Market]], with the new [[King's Company]]. Its original members were [[Michael Mohun]], [[William Wintershall]], [[Robert Shatterell]], [[William Cartwright (actor)|William Cartwright]], [[Walter Clun]], [[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]] and [[Nicholas Burt]]. They played for a time at the old [[Red Bull Theatre]], but in 1663 the company moved to the new [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal in Drury Lane]]. (Unfortunately, Killigrew gained a reputation as an incompetent manager; he was constantly in disputes with his actors and had to bribe his stars to keep working for him.) Killigrew staged plays by [[Aphra Behn]], [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]]...and Thomas Killigrew, as well as revivals of [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]. Having inherited the rights and repertory of the old [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the King's Company  performed many of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works, in the rewritten forms that were so popular at the time and so disparaged later. Two Killigrew productions of his own ''Parson's Wedding'', in 1664 and 1672-3, were cast entirely with women.\n\nIn 1673, Killigrew was appointed [[Master of the Revels]]. He lost control of his theatre in a conflict with his son Charles in 1677. (Charles, in turn, went bust a year later.) Thomas Killigrew died at [[Whitehall Palace|Whitehall]] on 19 March 1683.\n[[File:Anthony van Dyck- Thomas Killigrew and (possibly) Lord William Crofts.JPG|thumbnail|330px|  Thomas Killigrew and (possibly)  Lord William Crofts by  [[Anthony van Dyck]]]]\nThomas Killigrew's dramas are:\n\n*''[[The Prisoners (play)|The Prisoners]]'' (written c. 1632-5 in [[London]]; printed 1641)\n*''[[Claricilla]]'' (c. 1636, [[Rome]]; printed 1641)\n*''[[The Princess (Killigrew)|The Princess, or Love at First Sight]]'' (c. 1636; [[Naples]])\n*''[[The Parson's Wedding]]'' (c. 1637; [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]])\n*''The Pilgrim'' ([[Paris]])\n*''Bellamira Her Dream, or Love of Shadows'' (two-part play; [[Venice]])\n*''[[Cicilia and Clorinda|Cicilia and Clorinda, or Love in Arms]]'' (two-part play; ''Cicilia'', c. 1650, [[Turin]]; ''Clorinda'', 1651, [[Florence]])\n*''[[Thomaso|Thomaso, or the Wanderer]]'' (two-part play; [[Madrid]]).\n\nIn 1664,<ref>In the collected edition, each play has a separate title page (common in seventeenth-century collections); and some of these title pages are dated 1663 instead of 1664, causing some confusion in Killigrew's bibliography. (This type of misdating is not unusual in the collections of the era.)</ref> [[Henry Herringman]] published a collected edition of Killigrew's dramas, titled ''Comedies and Tragedies'' (rather inaccurately, since the majority of the plays are [[tragicomedy|tragicomedies]]). Only his two earliest plays had been printed previously.

The bezant\u00e9e bordure indicates a connection to the ancient [[Earl of Cornwall|Earls of Cornwall]]]]\n'''Thomas Killigrew''' (7 February 1612 \u2013 19 March 1683) was an [[England|English]] [[dramatist]] and theatre manager. He was a witty, dissolute figure at the court of King [[Charles II of England]].\n\n==Life and work==\n\nKilligrew was one of twelve children of Sir [[Robert Killigrew]] of Hanworth, a courtier to [[James I of England|James I]], and his wife [[Mary Woodhouse|Mary n\u00e9e Woodhouse]]; he became a page to King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] at about the age of thirteen. According to [[Samuel Pepys]], the boy Killigrew used to volunteer as an extra, or \"devil,\" at the [[Red Bull Theatre]], so that he could see the plays for free. The young Killigrew had limited formal education; the Court and the playhouse were his schoolroom.\n\nKilligrew was present at the exorcism of the possessed nuns of [[Loudun possessions|Loudun]]. In 1635 he left a sceptical account of the proceedings.<ref>[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley, Aldous]] (1952) ''[[The Devils of Loudun]]''. New York: Harper</ref>\n\nBefore the [[English Civil War]], Killigrew wrote several plays\u2014[[tragicomedy|tragicomedies]] like ''Claracilla'' and ''The Prisoners'', as well as his most popular play, ''The Parson's Wedding'' (1637). The latter play has been criticized for its coarse humour; but it also contains prose readings of [[John Donne]]'s poetry to pique a literate audience.<ref>Keast, William R. (1950) \"Killigrew's Use of Donne in ''The Parson's Wedding''\" in: ''Modern Language Review'', 45 (1950), pp. 512-15</ref>\n\nA Royalist and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], Killigrew followed Prince Charles (the future [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]) into exile in 1647. In the years 1649-51, he was in [[Paris]], [[Geneva]], and [[Rome]], and in the later year was appointed Charles' representative in [[Venice]]. (It has been said that Killigrew wrote each of his plays in a different city; ''Thomaso, or the Wanderer'' was written in [[Madrid]])\n\nAt the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660, Killigrew returned to England along with many other Royalist exiles. Charles rewarded his loyalty by making him [[Groom of the Bedchamber]] and Chamberlain to Queen [[Catherine of Braganza|Catherine]]. He had a reputation as a wit; in his famous Diary, [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote that Killigrew had the office of the King's fool and jester, with privilege to mock and revile even the most prominent without penalty {{ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1668/February#13th|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', Thursday, 13 February 1668]]}}\n\nAlong with Sir [[William Davenant]], he was given a royal warrant to form a [[theatre]] company in 1660\u2014which gave Killigrew a key role in the revival of English drama. Killigrew beat Davenant to a debut, at [[Gibbon's Tennis Court]] in [[Clare Market]], with the new [[King's Company]]. Its original members were [[Michael Mohun]], [[William Wintershall]], [[Robert Shatterell]], [[William Cartwright (actor)|William Cartwright]], [[Walter Clun]], [[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]] and [[Nicholas Burt]]. They played for a time at the old [[Red Bull Theatre]], but in 1663 the company moved to the new [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal in Drury Lane]]. (Unfortunately, Killigrew gained a reputation as an incompetent manager; he was constantly in disputes with his actors and had to bribe his stars to keep working for him.) Killigrew staged plays by [[Aphra Behn]], [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]]...and Thomas Killigrew, as well as revivals of [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]. Having inherited the rights and repertory of the old [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the King's Company  performed many of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works, in the rewritten forms that were so popular at the time and so disparaged later. Two Killigrew productions of his own ''Parson's Wedding'', in 1664 and 1672-3, were cast entirely with women.\n\nIn 1673, Killigrew was appointed [[Master of the Revels]]. He lost control of his theatre in a conflict with his son Charles in 1677. (Charles, in turn, went bust a year later.) Thomas Killigrew died at [[Whitehall Palace|Whitehall]] on 19 March 1683.\n[[File:Anthony van Dyck- Thomas Killigrew and (possibly) Lord William Crofts.JPG|thumbnail|330px|  Thomas Killigrew and (possibly)  Lord William Crofts by  [[Anthony van Dyck]]]]\nThomas Killigrew's dramas are:\n\n*''[[The Prisoners (play)|The Prisoners]]'' (written c. 1632-5 in [[London]]; printed 1641)\n*''[[Claricilla]]'' (c. 1636, [[Rome]]; printed 1641)\n*''[[The Princess (Killigrew)|The Princess, or Love at First Sight]]'' (c. 1636; [[Naples]])\n*''[[The Parson's Wedding]]'' (c. 1637; [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]])\n*''The Pilgrim'' ([[Paris]])\n*''Bellamira Her Dream, or Love of Shadows'' (two-part play; [[Venice]])\n*''[[Cicilia and Clorinda|Cicilia and Clorinda, or Love in Arms]]'' (two-part play; ''Cicilia'', c. 1650, [[Turin]]; ''Clorinda'', 1651, [[Florence]])\n*''[[Thomaso|Thomaso, or the Wanderer]]'' (two-part play; [[Madrid]]).\n\nIn 1664,<ref>In the collected edition, each play has a separate title page (common in seventeenth-century collections); and some of these title pages are dated 1663 instead of 1664, causing some confusion in Killigrew's bibliography. (This type of misdating is not unusual in the collections of the era.)</ref> [[Henry Herringman]] published a collected edition of Killigrew's dramas, titled ''Comedies and Tragedies'' (rather inaccurately, since the majority of the plays are [[tragicomedy|tragicomedies]]). Only his two earliest plays had been printed previously. The collected edition identifies the city in which Killigrew supposedly wrote each play.\n\n''The Parson's Wedding'' and ''Claricilla'' were successful stage plays.
