Based on later reports, the club has a claim to have been established some time in 1860 in the twin villages of [[St. Mary Cray]] and [[St Paul's Cray]], near [[Orpington]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Vain Games of No Value by Terry Morris | publisher = Author House| date = 2016 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GrfCCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT122&lpg=PT122&dq=Cray+Wanderers+1860&source=bl&ots=6YFc0q4QOr&sig=vX_cTjNOLwV-y_5PxSe0B5S7eiI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT-fifn8XMAhWE6xQKHeqGAGM4HhDoAQhNMAg#v=onepage&q=Cray%20Wanderers%201860&f=false | accessdate = 15 September 2016}}</ref> Such a date would make it one of the [[oldest football club]]s in the world.\n\nThey currently play their home matches at [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]]'s [[Hayes Lane]] ground (capacity 5,000). Cray Wanderers were [[Kent Football League|Kent League]] champions four times, and have reached the fourth qualifying round of the [[FA Cup]] once in their history. They are currently members of the {{English football updater|CrayWand}}.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first origins of Cray Wanderers are linked to the construction of the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] line during 1858 to 1860.<ref name=\"OHist\"/> During their leisure time, migrant workers kicked a ball around, and that is how the club originated in the [[St Mary Cray]] village. The pitch at Star Lane is now a cemetery, and is located beneath the nine-arch railway viaduct that spans the Cray Valley. The industrial belt of the [[River Cray]], especially the paper mills, provided much of the club's support up till the 1950s.\n   \nCray Wanderers were a strong force in senior county football at the turn of the century. After being Kent Junior Cup semi-finalists and finalists in 1890\u201391 and 1891\u201392 they entered the first ever [[FA Amateur Cup]] competition in 1893\u201394. They had a spell as a professional club between 1895 and 1907. They were a nursery club for [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] during part of this period. They were one of the founder members of the [[Kent Football League|Kent League]] in 1894\u201395, and they won the championship in 1901\u201302. Other honours included Southern Suburban League champions in 1898\u201399, West Kent League champions in 1903\u201304, and [[Kent Senior Cup]] runners-up in 1899\u20131900.\n\nAfter [[World War One]], Cray switched to the [[London League (football)|London League]] where they remained till 1934. In the 1930\u201331 season they won the Kent Amateur Cup. Cray rejoined the Kent League in 1934\u201335, but their four-year stay came to grief when 1936 saw the loss of the Fordcroft ground in Cray Avenue, their home since 1898. Cray were forced to drop into a lower level of football, drifting from one temporary pitch to another while the club committee dwindled to a perilously small number. The team struggled badly in the South London Alliance and the Kent Amateur League.\n\n1951/52 heralded a new era, and an upturn in the club's fortunes, when local businessman Mick Slater took over at the helm. The club was elected to the London League and regained its senior status. Cray moved to a new ground at Grassmeade in 1955. Their stay there was a very successful period in the club's history. Drawing extra support from the commuter town of [[Orpington]], they played in the London League and then the [[Aetolian League]]. They were three times crowned champions, won the League Cup twice, and also won the Kent Amateur Cup three times.\n\nCray switched to the semi-professional [[Metropolitan League]] for five seasons commencing in 1966\u201367. In 1971\u201372 the [[Metropolitan London League|Met London League]] was created by a merger of the Metropolitan League and the [[Greater London League]].\n   \nCray moved to Oxford Road in 1973\u201374. Johnny Biddle and Jimmy Wakeling proved to be successful managers. In 1974/75 Cray won the Met London League and League Cup, scoring 170 goals in all matches that season. In 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378 Cray won the [[London Spartan League]] championship.\n\nCray decided to return to the Kent League in 1978\u201379. Success came quickly because Cray won the championship in 1980/81, having been runners-up the year before. Their powerful new team under manager Harry Richardson reached the [[FA Vase]] quarter-final and 5th round in those two seasons. After that, the 1980s decade brought only one more piece of silverware, the Kent League Cup in 1983\u201384. After finishing Kent League runners up in 1990/91, Cray had a lean period during most of the 1990s, with the exception of 1992\u201393 when they won the Kent Senior Trophy.\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers FC Kent League champions 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Kent League champions in 1981.]]\n\nA new club chairman Gary Hillman arrived in 1994/95 and Ian Jenkins, a Cray player since 1993, was appointed manager in 1999. By now, Cray were tenants of [[Bromley F.C.]]. As champions of the Kent League in 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304, also reaching the FA Vase quarter-final, they achieved promotion into the Isthmian League Division One.\n\nIn the [[Isthmian League 2007-08|2007\u201308]] season Cray reached the play-off final after finishing 3rd in the table, but lost to [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.|Tooting & Mitcham United]] 1\u20130 at [[Imperial Fields]]. They also reached the [[Kent Senior Cup]] final, played at Hayes Lane on 26 July, where they lost to [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Ebbsfleet United]] 4\u20130.<ref>{{cite web | title = Match Report: Cray Wanderers 0 Ebbsfleet United 4 | publisher = Official Website | date = | url = http://www.craywands.co.uk/cray0ebbsfleet4.pdf | accessdate = 2008-09-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Cray again reached the play-off final the following year, in which they beat [[Metropolitan Police F.C.|Metropolitan Police]] 1\u20130 and were promoted to the [[Isthmian League Premier Division]].\n\nCray Wanderers celebrated their 150th anniversary during the summer of 2010, including friendlies against the other two oldest clubs in the world, [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield]] and [[Hallam F.C.|Hallam]], in a three-team tournament.\n\nIan Jenkins, who had managed the club for 14 years, left in September 2013.<ref>[http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9312&Itemid=38 Kentishfootball.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002140419/http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9312&Itemid=38 |date=2 October 2013 }}</ref> Keith Bird and [[Mick Paye|Mike Paye]], managers of [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]]'s reserve team, were appointed as manager and assistant manager respectively. The team was relegated into the Isthmian League Division One North at the end of April 2014. Gary Abbott and Mike Paye became joint managers of the team at the start of October 2014. On 5 January 2015 the club appointed Tommy Warrilow as the new manager. Warrilow masterminded a dramatic \"Great Escape\" from a second successive relegation as the team won their last ten games of the season.\n\nFormer player Tony Russell took over for the [[2015-16 Isthmian League|2015\u201316]] season, guiding the team to fourth place in Division One North. Cray therefore qualified for the promotion play-offs but lost to [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]]. Two years later, they reached the play-offs again, this time after finishing 3rd in Division One South, but lost 5\u20132 to [[Walton Casuals F.C.|Walton Casuals]].

After playing at numerous other grounds, Cray played at Grassmeade from 1954 to 1973, after which they moved to Oxford Road.  Unfortunately for the club, in 1998 the Kent League ruled that clubs must have floodlighting.  As Cray were unable to have lights installed, they were forced to move out and share the Hayes Lane ground of [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]], although their reserve and youth teams continued to play at the former ground until 2011, when it was taken over by [[Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C.|Seven Acre Sports & Sidcup]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Club History (brief)| publisher = Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C. | url = http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/sportingclubthamesmeadfc/a/a-brief-history-of-sporting-club-thamesmead-fc-31729.html | accessdate = 2016-11-16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.jpg|thumb|right|Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.]]\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Cray announced plans to move to a new stadium near Orpington by 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chairman has grounds for optimism ahead of play-offs |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=28 April 2008 |url=http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013001/http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenkins faces Cup Final selection dilemma |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=13 July 2008 |url=http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013006/http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>  Official plans published on the club's official website on 18 February 2009 confirmed that the new ground at Sandy Lane would be open by 2014, for the 2014\u201315 season, subject to planning consent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cray Stop Wandering After 40 Years! |publisher=Official Website |date=18 February 2009 |url=http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |accessdate=2009-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223074138/http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |archivedate=23 February 2009 }}</ref>  The stadium, which is proposed to be part of a new \"Sports Village-like complex\" is set to be eco-friendly and be built to an initial [[Football Conference|Conference]] standard.\n\nThe bid was rejected unanimously, by all councillors on Bromley Council's Development Control Committee on Thursday 20 September 2012. This was for a number of reasons, but mainly because the Club was hoping to build a Football League sized stadium, using the profits from building nearly 200 houses and a large hotel on Green Belt land.\n\nIn the debate on the application, which was opposed by the Police and the GLA as well as other bodies, it was clear that Councillors were supportative of a proposal to relocate Cray Wanderers to a new home in St. Pauls Cray, but not to the building of houses, a hotel and another swimming pool, given that LA Leisure already have a swimming pool opposite the site, in order to fund it.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn 3 October 2014, Cray Wanderers signed a conditional contract to purchase Flamingo Park Sports Centre in St Paul\u2019s Cray on the A20 Sidcup bypass. The club had an 18-month period to obtain planning consent from Bromley Council for a new sporting community hub, featuring a new multi-sport stadium with a spectator capacity of 1,300. This was achieved in April 2016, when the Council approved the proposal.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bromley Council approve planning permission for Flamingo Park | publisher = Official website | date = 19 April 2016 | url = http://www.cray-wanderers.com/bromley-council-approve-planning-approval/  | accessdate = 2016-04-30}}</ref> There was disappointment when the application was later refused by the [[Mayor of London]] and a revised set of plans were being prepared in 2017.<ref>{{cite web | title = Stadium updates | publisher = Official website | date = 13 April 2017 | url = http://www.cray-wanderers.com/stadium-updates/  | accessdate = 2017-05-17}}</ref>.

Several other players have made first team appearances during the first season.\n\nIt was decided at the beginning of 2016 that this arrangement with Coopers School would come to an end.

Based on later reports, the club has a claim to have been established some time in 1860 in the twin villages of [[St. Mary Cray]] and [[St Paul's Cray]], near [[Orpington]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Vain Games of No Value by Terry Morris | publisher = Author House| date = 2016 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GrfCCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT122&lpg=PT122&dq=Cray+Wanderers+1860&source=bl&ots=6YFc0q4QOr&sig=vX_cTjNOLwV-y_5PxSe0B5S7eiI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT-fifn8XMAhWE6xQKHeqGAGM4HhDoAQhNMAg#v=onepage&q=Cray%20Wanderers%201860&f=false | accessdate = 15 September 2016}}</ref> Such a date would make it one of the [[oldest football club]]s in the world.\n\nThey currently play their home matches at [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]]'s [[Hayes Lane]] ground (capacity 5,000). Cray Wanderers were [[Kent Football League|Kent League]] champions four times, and have reached the fourth qualifying round of the [[FA Cup]] once in their history. They are currently members of the {{English football updater|CrayWand}}.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first origins of Cray Wanderers are linked to the construction of the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] line during 1858 to 1860.<ref name=\"OHist\"/> During their leisure time, migrant workers kicked a ball around, and that is how the club originated in the [[St Mary Cray]] village. The pitch at Star Lane is now a cemetery, and is located beneath the nine-arch railway viaduct that spans the Cray Valley. The industrial belt of the [[River Cray]], especially the paper mills, provided much of the club's support up till the 1950s.\n   \nCray Wanderers were a strong force in senior county football at the turn of the century. After being Kent Junior Cup semi-finalists and finalists in 1890\u201391 and 1891\u201392 they entered the first ever [[FA Amateur Cup]] competition in 1893\u201394. They had a spell as a professional club between 1895 and 1907. They were a nursery club for [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] during part of this period. They were one of the founder members of the [[Kent Football League|Kent League]] in 1894\u201395, and they won the championship in 1901\u201302. Other honours included Southern Suburban League champions in 1898\u201399, West Kent League champions in 1903\u201304, and [[Kent Senior Cup]] runners-up in 1899\u20131900.\n\nAfter [[World War One]], Cray switched to the [[London League (football)|London League]] where they remained till 1934. In the 1930\u201331 season they won the Kent Amateur Cup. Cray rejoined the Kent League in 1934\u201335, but their four-year stay came to grief when 1936 saw the loss of the Fordcroft ground in Cray Avenue, their home since 1898. Cray were forced to drop into a lower level of football, drifting from one temporary pitch to another while the club committee dwindled to a perilously small number. The team struggled badly in the South London Alliance and the Kent Amateur League.\n\n1951/52 heralded a new era, and an upturn in the club's fortunes, when local businessman Mick Slater took over at the helm. The club was elected to the London League and regained its senior status. Cray moved to a new ground at Grassmeade in 1955. Their stay there was a very successful period in the club's history. Drawing extra support from the commuter town of [[Orpington]], they played in the London League and then the [[Aetolian League]]. They were three times crowned champions, won the League Cup twice, and also won the Kent Amateur Cup three times.\n\nCray switched to the semi-professional [[Metropolitan League]] for five seasons commencing in 1966\u201367. In 1971\u201372 the [[Metropolitan London League|Met London League]] was created by a merger of the Metropolitan League and the [[Greater London League]].\n   \nCray moved to Oxford Road in 1973\u201374. Johnny Biddle and Jimmy Wakeling proved to be successful managers. In 1974/75 Cray won the Met London League and League Cup, scoring 170 goals in all matches that season. In 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378 Cray won the [[London Spartan League]] championship.\n\nCray decided to return to the Kent League in 1978\u201379. Success came quickly because Cray won the championship in 1980/81, having been runners-up the year before. Their powerful new team under manager Harry Richardson reached the [[FA Vase]] quarter-final and 5th round in those two seasons. After that, the 1980s decade brought only one more piece of silverware, the Kent League Cup in 1983\u201384. After finishing Kent League runners up in 1990/91, Cray had a lean period during most of the 1990s, with the exception of 1992\u201393 when they won the Kent Senior Trophy.\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers FC Kent League champions 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Kent League champions in 1981.]]\n\nA new club chairman Gary Hillman arrived in 1994/95 and Ian Jenkins, a Cray player since 1993, was appointed manager in 1999. By now, Cray were tenants of [[Bromley F.C.]]. As champions of the Kent League in 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304, also reaching the FA Vase quarter-final, they achieved promotion into the Isthmian League Division One.\n\nIn the [[Isthmian League 2007-08|2007\u201308]] season Cray reached the play-off final after finishing 3rd in the table, but lost to [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.|Tooting & Mitcham United]] 1\u20130 at [[Imperial Fields]].

The team was relegated into the Isthmian League Division One North at the end of April 2014. Gary Abbott and Mike Paye became joint managers of the team at the start of October 2014. On 5 January 2015 the club appointed Tommy Warrilow as the new manager. Warrilow masterminded a dramatic \"Great Escape\" from a second successive relegation as the team won their last ten games of the season.\n\nFormer player Tony Russell took over for the [[2015-16 Isthmian League|2015\u201316]] season, guiding the team to fourth place in Division One North. Cray therefore qualified for the promotion play-offs but lost to [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]]. Two years later, they reached the play-offs again, this time after finishing 3rd in Division One South, but lost 5\u20132 to [[Walton Casuals F.C.|Walton Casuals]].

After playing at numerous other grounds, Cray played at Grassmeade from 1954 to 1973, after which they moved to Oxford Road.  Unfortunately for the club, in 1998 the Kent League ruled that clubs must have floodlighting.  As Cray were unable to have lights installed, they were forced to move out and share the Hayes Lane ground of [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]], although their reserve and youth teams continued to play at the former ground until 2011, when it was taken over by [[Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C.|Seven Acre Sports & Sidcup]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Club History (brief)| publisher = Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C. | url = http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/sportingclubthamesmeadfc/a/a-brief-history-of-sporting-club-thamesmead-fc-31729.html | accessdate = 2016-11-16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.jpg|thumb|right|Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.]]\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Cray announced plans to move to a new stadium near Orpington by 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chairman has grounds for optimism ahead of play-offs |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=28 April 2008 |url=http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013001/http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenkins faces Cup Final selection dilemma |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=13 July 2008 |url=http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013006/http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>  Official plans published on the club's official website on 18 February 2009 confirmed that the new ground at Sandy Lane would be open by 2014, for the 2014\u201315 season, subject to planning consent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cray Stop Wandering After 40 Years! |publisher=Official Website |date=18 February 2009 |url=http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |accessdate=2009-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223074138/http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |archivedate=23 February 2009 }}</ref>  The stadium, which is proposed to be part of a new \"Sports Village-like complex\" is set to be eco-friendly and be built to an initial [[Football Conference|Conference]] standard.\n\nThe bid was rejected unanimously, by all councillors on Bromley Council's Development Control Committee on Thursday 20 September 2012. This was for a number of reasons, but mainly because the Club was hoping to build a Football League sized stadium, using the profits from building nearly 200 houses and a large hotel on Green Belt land.\n\nIn the debate on the application, which was opposed by the Police and the GLA as well as other bodies, it was clear that Councillors were supportative of a proposal to relocate Cray Wanderers to a new home in St. Pauls Cray, but not to the building of houses, a hotel and another swimming pool, given that LA Leisure already have a swimming pool opposite the site, in order to fund it.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn 3 October 2014, Cray Wanderers signed a conditional contract to purchase Flamingo Park Sports Centre in St Paul\u2019s Cray on the A20 Sidcup bypass. The club had an 18-month period to obtain planning consent from Bromley Council for a new sporting community hub, featuring a new multi-sport stadium with a spectator capacity of 1,300. This was achieved in April 2016, when the Council approved the proposal.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bromley Council approve planning permission for Flamingo Park | publisher = Official website | date = 19 April 2016 | url = http://www.cray-wanderers.com/bromley-council-approve-planning-approval/  | accessdate = 2016-04-30}}</ref> There was disappointment when the application was later refused by the [[Mayor of London]] and a revised set of plans were being prepared in 2017.<ref>{{cite web | title = Stadium updates | publisher = Official website | date = 13 April 2017 | url = http://www.cray-wanderers.com/stadium-updates/  | accessdate = 2017-05-17}}</ref>.

Several other players have made first team appearances during the first season.\n\nIt was decided at the beginning of 2016 that this arrangement with Coopers School would come to an end. The club are looking at establishing another Academy setup in the next couple of years.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Honours==\n*[[Isthmian League]] Division One\n**Winners (South East): [[2018\u201319 Isthmian League|2018\u201319]]\n**Runners-up (South): [[2008-09 Isthmian League|2008\u201309]]\n**Play-off Winners (South): [[2008-09 Isthmian League|2008\u201309]]\n*[[Kent Football League|Kent League]]: 1901\u201302, 1980\u201381, 2002\u201303, 2003\u201304\n**Runners Up: 1979\u201380, 1990\u201391\n*[[London League (football)|London League]]: 1956\u201357, 1957\u201358\n**Runners Up: 1953\u201354, 1954\u201355\n*[[Aetolian League (football)|Aetolian League]]: 1962\u201363\n*[[Greater London League]]: 1965-66\n*[[Metropolitan-London League]]: 1974-75\n*[[London Spartan League]]: 1976\u201377, 1977\u201378\n*[[Kent Senior Trophy]]: 1992-92, 2003\u201304\n*[[Kent Amateur Cup]]: 1930\u201331, 1962\u201363, 1963\u201364, 1964\u201365\n*Best league performance: 9th in [[Isthmian League Premier Division]], [[2010\u201311 Isthmian League|2010\u201311]], [[2011\u201312 Isthmian League|2011\u201312]]\n*Best [[FA Cup]] performance: 4th qualifying round, 2005\u201306\n*Best [[FA Trophy]] performance: 2nd round (equivalent of current 3rd qualifying round), 2004\u201305. 3rd qualifying round, 2005\u201306, 2006\u201307, 2008\u201309, 2012\u201313, 2014\u201315, 2017\u201318\n*Best [[FA Vase]] performance: Quarter-finals, 1979\u201380, 2003\u201304<ref>{{fchd|name=Cray Wanderers|id=CRAYW}}</ref>\n*Best [[Kent Senior Cup]] performance: Final, 1900\u201301, 2007\u201308\n\n==Current squad==\n<ref>[https://www.cray-wanderers.com/teams/first-team/ First team] Cray Wanderers F.C.</ref>\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=Lewis Carey}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=Grant Hall}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Tom Carlse}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Jay Leader}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Mitchell Nelson}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Geofrey Okwonko}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Joe Vines|other=player-assistant manager}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Barney Williams}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=[[Charlie Allen (footballer)|Charlie Allen]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Karl Dent}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Charles Etumnu}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=[[Jerome Federico]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Lee Lewis}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Ben Mundele}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Tom Phipp}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ZIM|pos=MF|name=[[Bradley Pritchard]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Aaron Rhule}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=AUS|pos=MF|name=[[Joel Rollinson]]|other=on loan from [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=[[Tom Murphy (English footballer)|Tom Murphy]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Joe Taylor}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Freddie Parker}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Rhys Murrell-Williamson}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n==Club staff==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Position\n!Name\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|'''Club Management'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Manager\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Tony Russell\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Player-Assistant Manager\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Joe Vines\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Coach\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Nathan White\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Goalkeeping Coach\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Grant Hall\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Physio\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Ally Maloney\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|'''Board'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Chairman\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Gary Hillman\n|-\n|}\n\n==Records==\n*Record attendance: 2160 vs [[Leytonstone F.C.|Leytonstone]] ([[FA Amateur Cup]], 1969)\n*Biggest Win: 15\u20130 vs [[Sevenoaks Town F.C.|Sevenoaks]], 1894\u201395\n*Biggest Defeat: 1\u201311 vs [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]], 1920\u201321\n*Biggest [[Isthmian League]] Win: 9\u20131 vs, [[Ashford United]]  2017\u201318 \n*Biggest [[Isthmian League]] Defeat: 3\u20139 vs Kingstonian, 2012\u201313\n\n===Player records===\n*Most appearances: John Dorey, 454 (1961\u201372), Jamie Wood, 461 (including some as non-playing sub) (1996-2010)\n*Most goals: Ken Collishaw, 274 (1954\u201365)\n\n==Managerial history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n \n|-\n!

The interests of the high nobility contrasted with the [[uniformity policy]] (i.e., upholding the traditional equality in status of the Swedish estates favoured by the kings and peasantry). In territories acquired during the periods of ''[[de facto]]'' noble rule, [[serfdom]] was not abolished, and there was also a trend to set up respective estates in [[Sweden proper]]. The [[Great Reduction (Sweden)|Great Reduction]] of 1680 put an end to these efforts of the nobility and required them to return estates once gained from the crown to the king. Serfdom, however, remained in force in the dominions acquired in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and in [[Swedish Estonia]], where a consequent application of the uniformity policy was hindered by the treaties by which they were gained.\n\nAfter the victories in the [[Thirty Years' War]], Sweden reached the climax of the great-power era during the [[Second Northern War]], when its primary adversary, Denmark, was neutralized by the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658 (this is when the Swedish empire is at its largest extent). However, in the further course of this war, as well as in the subsequent [[Scanian War]], Sweden was able to maintain its empire only with the support of its closest ally, [[Kingdom of France|France]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicklas|first=Thomas|title=Macht oder Recht.

But a decline began with his son, [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]]. After initial Swedish victories, Charles secured the empire for some time in the [[Peace of Travendal]] (1700) and the [[Treaty of Altranst\u00e4dt (1706)]], before the disaster that followed the king's war in Russia. The Russian victory at the [[Battle of Poltava]] put an end to Sweden's eastbound expansion, and by the time of Charles XII's death in 1718 only a much-weakened and far smaller territory remained. The last traces of occupied continental territory vanished during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and Finland went to Russia in 1809.\n\nIn older Swedish history telling, Gustavus Adolphus and especially Charles XII were heroic warriors. [[Sweden]] is the only [[Scandinavia]]n country to have ever reached the status of a military [[great power]].<ref>https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810105745689</ref><ref>http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:431840/FULLTEXT01.pdf</ref>\n\n==Emergence as a great power==\n{{Main|History of Sweden (1611\u201348)}}\nSweden emerged as a great European [[great power|power]] under [[Axel Oxenstierna]] and King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]]. As a result of acquiring territories seized from Russia and the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], as well as its involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]], Sweden found itself transformed into the leader of [[Protestant]]ism.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, Sweden managed to conquer approximately half of the member states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The fortunes of war would shift back and forth several times. After its defeat in the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)]], confidence in Sweden among the Swedish-controlled German states was damaged, and several of the provinces refused further Swedish military support, leaving Sweden with only a couple of northern German provinces. After France intervened on the same side as Sweden, fortunes shifted again. As the war continued, the civilian and military death toll grew, and when it was over, it had led to severe depopulation in the German states. Although exact population estimates do not exist, historians estimate that the population of the Holy Roman Empire fell by one-third as a result of the war.<ref>Jan De Vries, \"The economic crisis of the seventeenth century after fifty years.\" The Journal of Interdisciplinary History 40.2 (2009): 151-194 at p 160.</ref>\n\nSweden founded  [[Swedish overseas colonies|overseas colonies]], principally in the New World. [[New Sweden]] was founded in the valley of the [[Delaware River]] in 1638, and Sweden later laid claim to a number of Caribbean islands. A [[Swedish Gold Coast|string of Swedish forts and trading posts]] was constructed along the coast of West Africa as well, but these were not designed for Swedish settlers.\n\n===Peace of Westphalia===\n{{Main|Peace of Westphalia}}\n\nAt the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 granted Sweden territories as [[war reparations]]. Sweden demanded [[Silesia]], [[Swedish Pomerania|Pomerania]] (which had been in its possession since the [[Treaty of Stettin (1630)]], and a war indemnity of 20,000,000 [[Riksdaler]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\nThrough the efforts of [[Johan Oxenstierna]] and [[Johan Adler Salvius]] it obtained:\n* [[Swedish Pomerania]], the Swedish share of the former [[Duchy of Pomerania]] since the [[Treaty of Stettin (1653)]], consisting of\n**[[Western Pomerania]], with the islands of [[R\u00fcgen]], [[Usedom]] and [[Wollin]], as well as the towns of [[Stettin]], [[Greifswald]], and [[Stralsund]];\n**a strip of [[Farther Pomerania]] on the right side of the [[Oder]], including the towns of [[D\u0105bie, Szczecin|Damm]] and [[Gollnow]], with the right of succession to the rest of Farther Pomerania in the case of the extinction of the [[Brandenburg]] [[Hohenzollern]]s;\n* the town of [[Swedish Wismar|Wismar]], with the districts of Pod and [[Neukloster]];\n* the secularized bishoprics of [[Bremen-Verden]], with the town of [[Wildeshausen]]; and\n* 5,000,000 [[Riksdaler]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\nThese German possessions were to be held as [[Dominions of Sweden|fief]]s of the Holy Roman Empire. This allowed Sweden a vote in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] and enabled it to \"direct\" the [[Lower Saxon Circle]] alternately with [[Brandenburg]]. France and Sweden, moreover, became [[Guarantor of the imperial constitution|joint guarantors of the treaty with the Holy Roman Emperor]] and were entrusted with carrying out its provisions, as enacted by the executive congress of [[Nuremberg]] in 1650.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\nAfter the peaces of [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Br\u00f6msebro]] and Westphalia, Sweden was the third-largest area of control in Europe by land area, only surpassed by Russia and Spain. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent during this time under the rule of [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X Gustav]] (1622\u20131660) after the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658.<ref name=\"HayesPSH\">{{harvnb|Hayes|2002|p=}}</ref>\n\n==Dominions==\n{{See also|Dominions of Sweden}}\n[[File:Sweden 1658.jpg|thumb|Swedish possessions in 1658. The years in parentheses indicate when the possession was given up or lost.]]\n\nAs a result of eighteen years of war, Sweden gained small and scattered possessions, but had secured control of three principal rivers in northern Germany\u2014the [[Oder]], the [[Elbe]] and the [[Weser]]\u2014and gained toll-collection rights for those important commercial arteries. Two principal reasons for the small reparations were [[France]]'s envy and Queen [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]]'s impatience. As a result of Sweden's intervention, Sweden helped secure religious liberty in [[Europe]] for Protestants, becoming a leading power of Continental [[Protestantism]] for 90 years. The elevation of Sweden to the rank of an imperial power required that it remain a military monarchy, armed for possible emergency. Sweden's poverty and sparse population meant the country was ill-suited for imperial status. However, in the middle of the 17th century, with France as a firm ally, the incompatibility between its powers and its pretensions was not so obvious.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\n==Domestic consolidation==\nFor the moment, [[Sweden]] held a tenuous position of leadership. Careful statesmanship might mean permanent dominion on the Baltic shore, but left little room for mistakes.  Unfortunately, the extravagance of Gustavus Adolphus's two immediate successors, [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]] and [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X Gustav]], caused great difficulties for the new empire.\nChristina's financial extravagance brought the state to the verge of bankruptcy, and the financial difficulties caused public unrest before her abdication. The Swedish people feared that the external, artificial greatness of their country might be purchased with the loss of their civil and political liberties. The Swedish people looked to a new king to address the problem of too much power vested in the nobility.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\n[[File:Swedish Empire (1560-1815) en2.png|thumb|The development of Sweden and its empire from 1560 to 1815]]\n\nCharles X Gustav was a strong arbiter between the people and the nobility. Primarily a soldier, he directed his ambition towards military glory; but he was also an unusually sharp-sighted politician. While placing great emphasis on military strength, he also understood that domestic unity was necessary for a powerful foreign policy.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\nThe most pressing domestic question was the [[Reduction (Sweden)|reduction]], or restitution of alienated crown lands. At the [[Riksdag of the Estates]] of 1655, the king proposed that noble holders of crown property should either: 1) pay an annual sum of 200,000 Riksdaler out of the lands they would receive, or 2) surrender a fourth of the property itself, worth approximately 800,000 Riksdaler. The nobility wished to avoid taxation and stipulated that November 6, 1632, the day of Gustavus Adolphus's death, should be the limit to which retrospective taxes could be collected, and that there should be no further restitution of alienated crown property. Against this, the over-taxed lower estates protested, and the Diet had to be suspended. The king intervened, not to quell the commons, as the senate insisted, but to compel the nobility to give way. He proposed a special committee to investigate the matter before the meeting of the next Riksdag and that a proportional contribution should be levied on all classes in the meantime. Both groups accepted this arrangement.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\nCharles X Gustav had done his best to recover from the financial extravagance of Christina. However, his own desire for military glory may have caused problems for his country. In three days, he persuaded the Swedish estates of the potential of his attack on the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. However, when he left Stockholm for [[Warsaw]] on July 10, 1654, he gained more personal glory than advantage for his country. The [[Polish-Swedish War]] expanded into a general European war. He achieved passage over the [[Great Belt|Belts]] and emerged triumphant, only to die of sheer exhaustion. Immediately after his death, a regency was appointed to govern Sweden during the minority of his only son and successor, [[Charles XI of Sweden]], who was four years old. The regency council moved quickly to end the war with Sweden's numerous enemies, which now included the [[Tsardom of Russia]], the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] and [[Denmark-Norway]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\n==Peace of Oliva==\n{{Main|Second Northern War|Treaty of Oliva}}\n[[File:Anonymous Triumph of Charles X Gustavus.jpg|thumb|right|Triumph of [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|King Charles X Gustav]] over the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], 1655]]\n\nThe [[Peace of Oliva]] on May 3, 1660, put an end to the long feud with [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]. \n[[Early Modern France|French]] mediation of this treaty also ended the quarrel between Sweden, the Holy Roman emperor and the elector of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. This treaty confirmed both Sweden's possession of [[Duchy of Livonia (1629\u20131721)|Livonia]] and the elector of Brandenburg's sovereignty over [[Duchy of Prussia|Prussia]]; and the king of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] renounced to all claims to the Swedish crown. The treaty compelled [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] to reopen direct negotiations with Sweden. Eventually, under the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]] on May 27, 1660, Sweden kept the three formerly Danish [[Sk\u00e5neland|Scanian provinces]] and the formerly Norwegian [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] province, which Denmark-Norway had surrendered by the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] two years previously; but Sweden had to relinquish the Norwegian province of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] and the Danish island of [[Bornholm]], which had been surrendered at Roskilde. Denmark\u2013Norway was also compelled to recognize the independence of the dukes of [[Holstein-Gottorp]]. The [[Russo-Swedish War (1656\u20131658)]] was terminated by the [[Treaty of Cardis]] on July 2, 1661, through which the [[Alexis I of Russia|Tsar]] surrendered the Baltic provinces to Sweden \u2014 [[Duchy of Ingria|Ingria]], [[Duchy of Estonia (1561\u20131721)|Estonia]] and [[County of Kexholm|Kexholm]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}}\n\nThus, Sweden emerged from the war not only a military power, but also one of the largest states of Europe, possessing more than twice as much territory as modern Sweden.  The land area of Sweden was 1,100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. While modern Sweden is bounded by the Baltic, during the 17th century the Baltic formed a bond between various widely dispersed [[Dominions of Sweden|dominions]]. All the islands in the Baltic, except the Danish group, belonged to Sweden. The estuaries of all the great [[German rivers]] lay within Swedish territory, which also included two-thirds of [[Lake Ladoga]] and one-half of [[Lake Peipus]]. [[Stockholm]], the capital, lay in the very centre of the empire, whose second greatest city was [[Riga]], on the other side of the sea. This empire contained about a quarter of the population of modern Sweden, at only 2,500,000 people, or about 2.3 people per square kilometer. However, Sweden's expansion had been possible partly due to turmoil and weakness in countries in its vicinity, and when they became more stable, they began to look for chances to regain what was lost.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}}\n\n==Danish defeat==\n{{See also|Second Northern War}}\n[[File:S\u00e9bastien Bourdons-Karl X Gustav.jpg|thumb|[[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|King Charles X Gustav]]]]\n\nSweden had now won considerable political influence, which was lessened by the loss of moral prestige. On [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X Gustav]]'s accession in 1655, Sweden's neighbours may have become allies; however, territorial loss combined with the loss of religious liberty lessened their ties to Sweden. At Charles X Gustav's death, five years later, Sweden had not only damaged its newly claimed territories but also had become hated by the surrounding states for its lack of defence of Protestantism.  Charles X Gustav's attempt to gain the favour of [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] by dividing Poland not only reversed his original policy, but also created a new southern rival almost as dangerous as [[Denmark-Norway|Denmark]] in the west.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}}\n\nIn 1660, after five years of warfare, Sweden had obtained peace and the opportunity to organize and develop the new vast realm. Unfortunately, the fifteen-year regency that followed Charles X Gustav was unable to manoeuvre through the situation it faced.  The administration was internally divided and hindered by the lack of unity and talent among its statesmen.  The two major rivals were the military-aristocratic party headed by [[Magnus de la Gardie]] and the party of peace and economy led by [[Johan Gyllenstierna]]. The aristocratic group prevailed and brought with it a decline of morality which made it notorious to its neighbours. The administration was noted for sloth and carelessness leading to a general neglect of business. Additionally, government corruption led Sweden to be hired by foreign powers. This \"subsidy policy\" dates from the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1661)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] of 1661, through which Sweden, in exchange for a considerable sum of money, supported the French candidate for the Polish throne. Sweden was torn between [[Louis XIV of France]] and his adversaries in plans to control the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. The anti-French faction prevailed; and in April 1668, Sweden acceded to the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], which ended the French acquisitions through the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. For the next four years, Sweden remained true to the Triple Alliance; but, in 1672, Louis XIV succeeded in isolating the [[Dutch Republic]] and regaining Sweden as an ally. By the [[Treaty of Stockholm (1672)|Treaty of Stockholm]] on April 14, 1672, Sweden entered an agreement with the French to protect its sphere of interest containing the Dutch Republic from hostile German claims in return for 400,000 Riksdaler per annum in peace and 600,000 in wartime.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}}\n\n==Scanian War==\n{{See also|Scanian War}}\n\nIn 1674, Louis XIV called upon Sweden to invade the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]]. In May 1675, a Swedish army advanced into the Mark but was defeated on June 18 at [[Battle of Fehrbellin|Fehrbellin]] and retreated to Swedish [[Demmin]]. The Fehrbellin affair was a mere [[skirmish]], with actual casualties numbering fewer than 600 men, but it made Sweden appear vulnerable and enabled neighbouring countries to attack in the [[Scanian War]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}}\n\nAt this point, the empire began to crumble. In 1675, [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[Duchy of Bremen]] were taken by the Brandenburgers, [[Austria]]ns, and Danes. In December 1677, the elector of Brandenburg captured [[Stettin]]. [[Stralsund]] fell on October 15, 1678. [[Greifswald]], Sweden's last possession on the continent, was lost on November 5. A defensive alliance with [[John III of Poland]] was rendered inoperative on August 4, 1677, by the annihilation of Sweden's sea-power; the [[Battle of \u00d6land]], June 17, 1676; the [[Battle of Fehmarn]], June 1677, and most notable on July 1-July 2 the [[Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay (1677)|Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}} The difficulties concerning the Polish king continued. The Scanian provinces (Scania, Halland and Blegind/Blekinge), once eastern Denmark, became the centre of intense fighting between Swedes and Danes, with a large scale confrontation between the main armies near Lund in December 1676. After that, Scania was divided into Danish and Swedish enclaves centering around the main cities for the rest of the war. The remaining territories in Scania were mainly a no man's land where a fierce \"little war\" took place, with Swedish troops on the one side and Danish official and semi-official troops (freeshooters etc.) in conjunction with armed locals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThrough homeland military successes of the young Swedish king and the diplomatic activity of Louis XIV, a peace congress began sessions at Nijmegen in March 1677. In the beginning of April 1678, the French king dictated the terms of a peace. One of his chief conditions was the complete restitution of Sweden, as he needed a strong Swedish ally. However, Charles XI refused to go along with ceding territories to its enemies, which led the French king to negotiate on behalf of Sweden without its consent. By the [[Treaties of Nijmegen]] on February 7 and of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|St. Germain]] on June 29, 1679, Sweden received almost full restitution of its German territory. By the [[Peace of Fontainebleau]] confirmed by the subsequent [[Peace of Lund]] on September 2, [[Denmark]] was to return all the land it had captured to Sweden on October 4, 1679. While Sweden could never have gained these concessions alone, Charles XI formed a personal dislike of the French king and developed a strong anti-French bias.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==Charles XI==\n{{See also|Charles XI of Sweden}}\n\nThe remainder of the reign of [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] is remarkable for a revolution, in which the government of Sweden was transformed to a semi-absolute monarchy. The king emerged from the war convinced that if Sweden were to retain its position as a great power, it needed to reform its whole economic system radically and circumscribe the power of the aristocracy. Charles XI felt that he could do it now that he had allies in the lower orders to support him.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=205}}\n\nThe [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag]] of Stockholm, October 1680, began a new era of Swedish history. On the motion of the [[Estate of Peasants]], the question of the recovery of the alienated crown lands was brought before the Riksdag, and a resolution of the Diet directed that all [[count]]ships, [[baron]]ies, domains, [[Manorialism|manor]]s and other estates producing an annual rent of more than a certain amount per annum should revert to the Crown. The same Riksdag decided that the king was not bound by any particular [[Constitution of Sweden|constitution]], but only by law and statutes, and not even obligated to consult the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Privy Council]], but was to be regarded as a sovereign lord. The Privy Council changed its official title from [[Riksr\u00e5d]] (council of state) to [[Kungligt r\u00e5d]] (royal council); a visible sign that the councillors were no longer the king's colleagues, but rather his servants.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=205}}\n\n[[File:Charles XI of Sweden.jpg|thumb|left|King Charles XI]]\n\nThus, Sweden had become an [[absolute monarchy]] but enacted the right of the Swedish people, in [[Riksdag of the Estates|parliament]], to be consulted on all important matters. The Riksdag, completely overshadowed by the Crown, did little more than register the royal decrees during the reign of [[Charles XI of Sweden]]; but it continued to exist as an essential part of the government. Moreover, this transfer of authority was a voluntary act. The people, knowing the king to be their ally, trusted and cooperated with him.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The Riksdag of 1682 declared that the king was empowered to bestow [[fief]]s and take them back again, making the king the disposer of his subjects' temporal property. Presently, this new principle of [[autocracy]] was extended to the king's legislative authority, when on December 9, 1682, all four estates not only confirmed that the king held the legislative powers enjoyed by his predecessors, but even gave him the right of interpreting and amending the common law.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=205}}\n\nThe recovery of the alienated crown lands occupied Charles XI for the rest of his life. He created a commission, which was ultimately converted into a permanent department of state. It acted on the principle that the titles of all private landed estates might be called in question, because at some time or other they must have belonged to the Crown, and the burden of proof of ownership lay with the actual owner of the property, not the Crown. The amount of revenue accruing to the Crown from the whole \"Reduktion\" is impossible to estimate; but by these means, combined with careful management and rigid economy, Charles XI reduced the national debt by three quarters.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=205}}\n\nCharles XI re-established on a broader basis the reorganization of the \"indelningsverk\" \u2014 a system of military tenure in which national forces were bound to the soil. This tied to the \"rust hail tenure\", under which the tenants, instead of paying rent, were obliged to equip and maintain a cavalry soldier and horse; while the knekth\u00e5llare supplied duly equipped foot soldiers. Soldiers were provided with holdings on which they lived in times of peace. Formerly, ordinary conscription had existed alongside this indelning, or distribution system, but it had proved inadequate as well as highly unpopular, and in 1682, Charles XI ended it in favor of an extended distribution system. The [[Swedish Royal Navy]] was entirely remodeled; and, the recent war having demonstrated the unsuitability of [[Stockholm]] as a naval station, the construction of a new arsenal was begun at [[Karlskrona]]. After seventeen years of financial difficulties, the twofold enterprise was completed. At the death of Charles XI, Sweden could boast of a fleet of forty-three three-deckers, manned by 11,000 men and armed with 2,648 guns, and one of the finest arsenals in the world.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=205}}\n\n==Charles XII and the Great Northern War==\n{{See also|Great Northern War}}\n[[File:Karl XII 1706.jpg|thumb|[[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]]]]\n\nAfter Charles XI's death, the throne was inherited by his underage son, [[Charles XII]]. After a brief regency, he was declared to be of age to rule. Three years later, in 1700, Denmark, Poland and Russia, the countries that had lost the most territory to Sweden, jointly declared war. Denmark was soon forced to peace after a joint intervention of Swedish, English and Dutch armies, whereafter the King and much of the Swedish army was shipped to the Baltic provinces, where Russian and Polish armies were laying siege to several towns. The Russian army was soundly defeated in the [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]], after which Charles took the army into Poland with the intent of dethroning the Polish king [[Augustus II of Poland|Augustus II]]. This took several years, but in 1706, with the [[Treaty of Altranst\u00e4dt (1706)|Treaty of Altranst\u00e4dt]], he reached his goal.\n\nIn the meantime, Russia had managed to take possession of several towns by the Baltic Sea. Instead of trying to retake these, Charles chose to march directly on Moscow, but due to extreme weather, difficulties with his [[supply line]]s and the Russian [[scorched earth]] strategy, he was forced to turn towards [[Ukraine]]. In 1709, the Swedish army was defeated and captured in the [[Battle of Poltava]]; Charles managed to escape south to [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Following the defeat at Poltava, Poland and Denmark re-entered the war, along with other countries wanting parts of the Swedish provinces. In the following years, most of them would fall, and Russia [[Greater Wrath|occupied the eastern half of Sweden]] (present-day [[Finland]]).\n\nDespite these setbacks, Charles XII twice tried to invade Norway to force Denmark-Norway out of the war again. On November 30, 1718, King Charles XII was mortally wounded during the [[siege of Fredriksten]] Fortress in Fredrikshald, today's [[Halden]]. With his death, Swedish war efforts mostly came to a halt, although Russia continued to harass the civilian population of the Swedish coastal areas until the concluding [[Treaty of Nystad]] was finally signed in 1721. Sweden would remain a [[regional power]] of varying success until the 19th century, but the Great Northern War put an end to Sweden's time as a great power.\n\n==Military history==\n{{History of Sweden}}\n{{see also|Military of the Swedish Empire}}\nA major reason why Sweden could be so successful in wars with such a scarce number of soldiers was its advanced military tactics. Sweden was able to reform its military tactics continuously throughout the period. Prior to Gustavus Adolphus's reforms, both his father, Charles IX, and his uncle [[Erik XIV]] had tried to reform the army but had effectively failed to do so. Charles IX, like most other rulers, had tried to implement the Dutch system{{clarify|what was this system?|date=September 2015}} into the army but with limited success. The lack of a strict organisation in the infantry caused the proportion of pikemen to musketeers to be far lower than the preferred ratio of 1 to 1. This, combined with the lack of funds to provide the soldiers with armour, caused the Swedish infantry to be dangerously lightly equipped and unable to deal with cavalry or heavier infantry in open terrain. Charles IX was, however, able to implement the Dutch system for fighting in [[caracole]] among the cavalry, with unfortunate results. His partially reformed army suffered [[Battle of Kircholm|a disastrous defeat]] at [[Kircholm]] against a Polish-Lithuanian army led by [[Jan Karol Chodkiewicz]]. The [[Hussaria]] were the last shock cavalry in Europe still fighting with [[lance]]s, yet they proved with terrifying effect the superiority of aggressive charging compared to the more defensive caracole used in the rest of Europe. In the end, Charles IX's revolt against his nephew [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund of Poland]] and subsequent rise to the throne of Sweden caused a dynastic struggle for the throne of Sweden that would not finally end until the [[treaty of Oliva]] in 1660.\n\nGustav II Adolph inherited the Polish war together with the [[Kalmar War]] against Denmark when Charles IX died in 1611. The war against Denmark was a terrible loss that forced Sweden to pay [[\u00c4lvsborg Ransom (1613)|a ransom]] of 1 million silverdaler to regain \u00c4lvsborg (final payment, 1619). The Polish war was interrupted by a series of truces caused by Sweden's weakness along with the unwillingness of the Polish nobility to fight a war considered only to be in Sigismund III's personal interest. The costly peace with Denmark and Poland-Lithuania's inability to mount a seaborne attack on the Swedish mainland gave time for Gustavus Adolphus to reform his armies. The continuation of the Polish war in 1625\u20131629 gave Gustavus Adolphus the opportunity to test and further improve his army against the Polish-Lithuanian army with its fearsome cavalry, the [[Winged Hussars]].\n\nBy the time of the [[Swedish Intervention in the Thirty Years' War]] in 1630, Gustav II Adolph had transformed the Swedish (Gustavian) army into an army in which the cavalry fought with aggressive shock tactics, closer to the Polish tactics than the [[Western Europe]]an. The [[Caracole]] and heavy armor were mostly abandoned, and the [[saber]] replaced the [[wheellock]] [[pistol]] as the primary weapon of the [[cavalry]]. Horsemen rode knee-by-knee in a tight formation. When in range, they switched to gallop and charged, and at a range of ten yards, shot both their pistols. A standard regiment numbered 250 simultaneous shots that would blast a hole in the enemy ranks. They then continued the charge with [[sabre]]s (''v\u00e4rjor''), aiming to break the enemy formation. The infantry was meanwhile employed in a defensive manner, relying on their superior firepower to break enemy attacks. Smaller musketeer detachments (~200 men) were used during the Polish war to support the cavalry against the superior Polish-Lithuanian cavalry.\nGustavus Adolphus earned the title \"father of modern warfare\" because of his revolutionary tactics during the Thirty Years' War, which later inspired other nations and became standard tactics. He became the foremost model of many later [[List of Swedish monarchs|Swedish kings]]. \n\nAt the time [[Finns]] were an essential part of the Swedish military. Roughly 2/5 of the infantry and 3/7 of the cavalry in the army were from [[Finland]].{{when?|date=December 2019}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kansallisten instituutioiden muotoutuminen \u2013 Suomalainen historiakuva Oma Maa -kirjasarjassa 1900-1960|last=Karonen, Petri and R\u00e4ih\u00e4 Antti (edit.)|first=|publisher=Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura|year=2014|isbn=978-952-222-606-8|location=Vantaa|pages=160}}</ref> They served in their own units which used [[Finnish language|Finnish]] as their main language.

Approximately 110 000 soldiers from Finland lost their lives serving the Swedish Empire between 1617\u20131721. Taking into account the contemporary number of inhabitants in Finland, it was relatively same than one million casulties in the 20th Century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Murhanenkeli|last=Keskisarja|first=Teemu|publisher=Siltala|year=2019|isbn=9789522346384|location=Helsinki|pages=246}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Attributed to Jacob Hoefnagel - Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden 1611-1632 - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]].]]\n\nThroughout the Thirty Years' War, the infantry's shock ability was continuously improved. The static nature of the infantry that served well against the cavalry-dominated Polish-Lithuanian army was enhanced during the war to produce infantry capable of both providing devastating firepower and executing offensive maneuvers. Initially, at the [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)]], the infantry was almost entirely reliant on their firepower and saw very limited offensive use; but under the leadership of [[Johan Ban\u00e9r]], who took command after the defeat at N\u00f6rdlingen, the Gustavian brigade system was finally changed into the battalion system recognisable from the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and the Great Nordic War (the depth was lowered from six ranks to three or four when the bayonet was introduced at the end of the 17th century).\n\nSwedish tactics once again greatly diverged from the continental tactics during the second half of the 17th century. The continental tactics increasingly emphasized the firepower of the battalion, while the Swedish ([[Caroleans|Carolean]]) tactics almost exclusively relied on the shock factor as the infantry and cavalry charged the enemy. As the bayonet was introduced, the pike was discarded in all armies except the Swedish and Russian by 1700.\n\nIn the Swedish army tactics of that time, retreat was never covered, and they were obliged to attack or fight where they stood. This was a military doctrine that (with the advantage of hindsight) might have proven a bit rash.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nThe infantry shock attack operated as follows. The two rear ranks of musketeers were ordered to shoot when \"you could not miss,\" a range of roughly 50 meters, and then to draw their swords before the battalion resumed their attack. The two foremost ranks then discharged at a range of roughly 20 meters before drawing their swords, and the charge began. At this range, the powerful [[musket]]s usually felled many enemy troops and was demoralising to them. Directly after the volley, the Swedes charged the enemy ranks with [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]s, [[bayonet]]s and sabres. Note that the pikes were used as an offensive weapon: in close combat, they had the advantage over their foes' weapons thanks to their range. After the bayonet was introduced in the Carolean army (1700\u20131706), the final volley was delayed until the soldiers were inside bayonet range.\n\nEvery infantry battalion had [[grenadier]]s attached. They supported the infantry attack by lobbing [[grenade]]s from the flanks. They also formed units of their own. They were otherwise equipped like infantry.\n\nThus, in the latter half of the 17th century, the major difference between the Swedish army and those common on the continent was the relative lack of firepower and the use of pikes and sabres. Sweden and Russia were the only countries at the time using pikes. In contemporary Europe, infantry were equipped with a musket, while in the Swedish army, every third man had a pike. The pikemen were normally deployed four men deep with musketeers of equal depth on the sides. The pike was used to repulse cavalry and to break the enemy lines as they charged.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Finland]]\n* [[History of Norway]]\n* [[History of Denmark]]\n* [[History of Estonia]]\n* [[History of Latvia]]\n* [[History of Pomerania]]\n* [[Swedish overseas colonies]]\n* [[Military of the Swedish Empire]]\n\n==References==\n{{More footnotes|date=May 2019}}\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{EB1911 |wstitle=Sweden |volume=26 |pages=188\u2013221 |first=Oskar Henrik |last=Dumrath}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last= Andersson |first= Ingvar |title= A History of Sweden |year= 1956 |publisher= Praeger |location= New York}}  [https://archive.org/details/historyofsweden00ande free to borrow for two weeks] pp 153\u2013237\n* Bain, R.

({{lang-sv|Stormaktstiden}}, \"the Era of Great Power\") was a [[Europe]]an [[great power]] that exercised territorial control over much of the [[Baltic region]] during the 17th and early 18th centuries.<ref name=Frost133343>{{harvnb|Frost|2000|pp=133\u2013134}}</ref> The beginning of the Empire is usually taken as the reign of [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], who ascended the throne in 1611, and its end as the loss of territories in 1721 following the [[Great Northern War]].<ref name=Frost133343/>\n\nAfter the death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632, the empire was controlled for lengthy periods by part of the high [[Swedish nobility|nobility]], such as the [[Oxenstierna]] family, acting as regents for minor monarchs. The interests of the high nobility contrasted with the [[uniformity policy]] (i.e., upholding the traditional equality in status of the Swedish estates favoured by the kings and peasantry). In territories acquired during the periods of ''[[de facto]]'' noble rule, [[serfdom]] was not abolished, and there was also a trend to set up respective estates in [[Sweden proper]]. The [[Great Reduction (Sweden)|Great Reduction]] of 1680 put an end to these efforts of the nobility and required them to return estates once gained from the crown to the king. Serfdom, however, remained in force in the dominions acquired in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and in [[Swedish Estonia]], where a consequent application of the uniformity policy was hindered by the treaties by which they were gained.\n\nAfter the victories in the [[Thirty Years' War]], Sweden reached the climax of the great-power era during the [[Second Northern War]], when its primary adversary, Denmark, was neutralized by the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658 (this is when the Swedish empire is at its largest extent) However, in the further course of this war, as well as in the subsequent [[Scanian War]], Sweden was able to maintain its empire only with the support of its closest ally, [[Kingdom of France|France]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicklas|first=Thomas|title=Macht oder Recht.

But a decline began with his son, [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]]. After initial Swedish victories, Charles secured the empire for some time in the [[Peace of Travendal]] (1700) and the [[Treaty of Altranst\u00e4dt (1706)]], before the disaster that followed the king's war in Russia. The Russian victory at the [[Battle of Poltava]] put an end to Sweden's eastbound expansion, and by the time of Charles XII's death in 1718 only a much-weakened and far smaller territory remained. The last traces of occupied continental territory vanished during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and Finland went to Russia in 1809.\n\nIn older Swedish history telling, Gustavus Adolphus and especially Charles XII were heroic warriors. [[Sweden]] is the only [[Scandinavia]]n country to have ever reached the status of a military [[great power]].<ref>https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810105745689</ref><ref>http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:431840/FULLTEXT01.pdf</ref>\n\n==Emergence as a great power==\n{{Main|History of Sweden (1611\u201348)}}\nSweden emerged as a great European [[great power|power]] under [[Axel Oxenstierna]] and King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]]. As a result of acquiring territories seized from Russia and the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], as well as its involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]], Sweden found itself transformed into the leader of [[Protestant]]ism.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, Sweden managed to conquer approximately half of the member states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The fortunes of war would shift back and forth several times. After its defeat in the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)]], confidence in Sweden among the Swedish-controlled German states was damaged, and several of the provinces refused further Swedish military support, leaving Sweden with only a couple of northern German provinces. After France intervened on the same side as Sweden, fortunes shifted again. As the war continued, the civilian and military death toll grew, and when it was over, it had led to severe depopulation in the German states. Although exact population estimates do not exist, historians estimate that the population of the Holy Roman Empire fell by one-third as a result of the war.<ref>Jan De Vries, \"The economic crisis of the seventeenth century after fifty years.\" The Journal of Interdisciplinary History 40.2 (2009): 151-194 at p 160.</ref>\n\nSweden founded  [[Swedish overseas colonies|overseas colonies]], principally in the New World. [[New Sweden]] was founded in the valley of the [[Delaware River]] in 1638, and Sweden later laid claim to a number of Caribbean islands. A [[Swedish Gold Coast|string of Swedish forts and trading posts]] was constructed along the coast of West Africa as well, but these were not designed for Swedish settlers.\n\n===Peace of Westphalia===\n{{Main|Peace of Westphalia}}\n\nAt the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 granted Sweden territories as [[war reparations]]. Sweden demanded [[Silesia]], [[Swedish Pomerania|Pomerania]] (which had been in its possession since the [[Treaty of Stettin (1630)]], and a war indemnity of 20,000,000 [[Riksdaler]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\nThrough the efforts of [[Johan Oxenstierna]] and [[Johan Adler Salvius]] it obtained:\n* [[Swedish Pomerania]], the Swedish share of the former [[Duchy of Pomerania]] since the [[Treaty of Stettin (1653)]], consisting of\n**[[Western Pomerania]], with the islands of [[R\u00fcgen]], [[Usedom]] and [[Wollin]], as well as the towns of [[Stettin]], [[Greifswald]], and [[Stralsund]];\n**a strip of [[Farther Pomerania]] on the right side of the [[Oder]], including the towns of [[D\u0105bie, Szczecin|Damm]] and [[Gollnow]], with the right of succession to the rest of Farther Pomerania in the case of the extinction of the [[Brandenburg]] [[Hohenzollern]]s;\n* the town of [[Swedish Wismar|Wismar]], with the districts of Pod and [[Neukloster]];\n* the secularized bishoprics of [[Bremen-Verden]], with the town of [[Wildeshausen]]; and\n* 5,000,000 [[Riksdaler]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\nThese German possessions were to be held as [[Dominions of Sweden|fief]]s of the Holy Roman Empire. This allowed Sweden a vote in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] and enabled it to \"direct\" the [[Lower Saxon Circle]] alternately with [[Brandenburg]]. France and Sweden, moreover, became [[Guarantor of the imperial constitution|joint guarantors of the treaty with the Holy Roman Emperor]] and were entrusted with carrying out its provisions, as enacted by the executive congress of [[Nuremberg]] in 1650.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\nAfter the peaces of [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Br\u00f6msebro]] and Westphalia, Sweden was the third-largest area of control in Europe by land area, only surpassed by Russia and Spain. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent during this time under the rule of [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X Gustav]] (1622\u20131660) after the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658.<ref name=\"HayesPSH\">{{harvnb|Hayes|2002|p=}}</ref>\n\n==Dominions==\n{{See also|Dominions of Sweden}}\n[[File:Sweden 1658.jpg|thumb|Swedish possessions in 1658. The years in parentheses indicate when the possession was given up or lost.]]\n\nAs a result of eighteen years of war, Sweden gained small and scattered possessions, but had secured control of three principal rivers in northern Germany\u2014the [[Oder]], the [[Elbe]] and the [[Weser]]\u2014and gained toll-collection rights for those important commercial arteries. Two principal reasons for the small reparations were [[France]]'s envy and Queen [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]]'s impatience. As a result of Sweden's intervention, Sweden helped secure religious liberty in [[Europe]] for Protestants, becoming a leading power of Continental [[Protestantism]] for 90 years. The elevation of Sweden to the rank of an imperial power required that it remain a military monarchy, armed for possible emergency. Sweden's poverty and sparse population meant the country was ill-suited for imperial status. However, in the middle of the 17th century, with France as a firm ally, the incompatibility between its powers and its pretensions was not so obvious.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\n==Domestic consolidation==\nFor the moment, [[Sweden]] held a tenuous position of leadership. Careful statesmanship might mean permanent dominion on the Baltic shore, but left little room for mistakes.  Unfortunately, the extravagance of Gustavus Adolphus's two immediate successors, [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]] and [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X Gustav]], caused great difficulties for the new empire.\nChristina's financial extravagance brought the state to the verge of bankruptcy, and the financial difficulties caused public unrest before her abdication. The Swedish people feared that the external, artificial greatness of their country might be purchased with the loss of their civil and political liberties. The Swedish people looked to a new king to address the problem of too much power vested in the nobility.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\n[[File:Swedish Empire (1560-1815) en2.png|thumb|The development of Sweden and its empire from 1560 to 1815]]\n\nCharles X Gustav was a strong arbiter between the people and the nobility. Primarily a soldier, he directed his ambition towards military glory; but he was also an unusually sharp-sighted politician. While placing great emphasis on military strength, he also understood that domestic unity was necessary for a powerful foreign policy.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\nThe most pressing domestic question was the [[Reduction (Sweden)|reduction]], or restitution of alienated crown lands. At the [[Riksdag of the Estates]] of 1655, the king proposed that noble holders of crown property should either: 1) pay an annual sum of 200,000 Riksdaler out of the lands they would receive, or 2) surrender a fourth of the property itself, worth approximately 800,000 Riksdaler. The nobility wished to avoid taxation and stipulated that November 6, 1632, the day of Gustavus Adolphus's death, should be the limit to which retrospective taxes could be collected, and that there should be no further restitution of alienated crown property. Against this, the over-taxed lower estates protested, and the Diet had to be suspended. The king intervened, not to quell the commons, as the senate insisted, but to compel the nobility to give way. He proposed a special committee to investigate the matter before the meeting of the next Riksdag and that a proportional contribution should be levied on all classes in the meantime. Both groups accepted this arrangement.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=203}}\n\nCharles X Gustav had done his best to recover from the financial extravagance of Christina. However, his own desire for military glory may have caused problems for his country. In three days, he persuaded the Swedish estates of the potential of his attack on the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. However, when he left Stockholm for [[Warsaw]] on July 10, 1654, he gained more personal glory than advantage for his country. The [[Polish-Swedish War]] expanded into a general European war. He achieved passage over the [[Great Belt|Belts]] and emerged triumphant, only to die of sheer exhaustion. Immediately after his death, a regency was appointed to govern Sweden during the minority of his only son and successor, [[Charles XI of Sweden]], who was four years old. The regency council moved quickly to end the war with Sweden's numerous enemies, which now included the [[Tsardom of Russia]], the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] and [[Denmark-Norway]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\n==Peace of Oliva==\n{{Main|Second Northern War|Treaty of Oliva}}\n[[File:Anonymous Triumph of Charles X Gustavus.jpg|thumb|right|Triumph of [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|King Charles X Gustav]] over the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], 1655]]\n\nThe [[Peace of Oliva]] on May 3, 1660, put an end to the long feud with [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]. \n[[Early Modern France|French]] mediation of this treaty also ended the quarrel between Sweden, the Holy Roman emperor and the elector of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. This treaty confirmed both Sweden's possession of [[Duchy of Livonia (1629\u20131721)|Livonia]] and the elector of Brandenburg's sovereignty over [[Duchy of Prussia|Prussia]]; and the king of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] renounced to all claims to the Swedish crown. The treaty compelled [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] to reopen direct negotiations with Sweden. Eventually, under the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]] on May 27, 1660, Sweden kept the three formerly Danish [[Sk\u00e5neland|Scanian provinces]] and the formerly Norwegian [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] province, which Denmark-Norway had surrendered by the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] two years previously; but Sweden had to relinquish the Norwegian province of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] and the Danish island of [[Bornholm]], which had been surrendered at Roskilde. Denmark\u2013Norway was also compelled to recognize the independence of the dukes of [[Holstein-Gottorp]]. The [[Russo-Swedish War (1656\u20131658)]] was terminated by the [[Treaty of Cardis]] on July 2, 1661, through which the [[Alexis I of Russia|Tsar]] surrendered the Baltic provinces to Sweden \u2014 [[Duchy of Ingria|Ingria]], [[Duchy of Estonia (1561\u20131721)|Estonia]] and [[County of Kexholm|Kexholm]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}}\n\nThus, Sweden emerged from the war not only a military power, but also one of the largest states of Europe, possessing more than twice as much territory as modern Sweden.  The land area of Sweden was 1,100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. While modern Sweden is bounded by the Baltic, during the 17th century the Baltic formed a bond between various widely dispersed [[Dominions of Sweden|dominions]]. All the islands in the Baltic, except the Danish group, belonged to Sweden. The estuaries of all the great [[German rivers]] lay within Swedish territory, which also included two-thirds of [[Lake Ladoga]] and one-half of [[Lake Peipus]]. [[Stockholm]], the capital, lay in the very centre of the empire, whose second greatest city was [[Riga]], on the other side of the sea. This empire contained about a quarter of the population of modern Sweden, at only 2,500,000 people, or about 2.3 people per square kilometer. However, Sweden's expansion had been possible partly due to turmoil and weakness in countries in its vicinity, and when they became more stable, they began to look for chances to regain what was lost.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}}\n\n==Danish defeat==\n{{See also|Second Northern War}}\n[[File:S\u00e9bastien Bourdons-Karl X Gustav.jpg|thumb|[[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|King Charles X Gustav]]]]\n\nSweden had now won considerable political influence, which was lessened by the loss of moral prestige. On [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X Gustav]]'s accession in 1655, Sweden's neighbours may have become allies; however, territorial loss combined with the loss of religious liberty lessened their ties to Sweden. At Charles X Gustav's death, five years later, Sweden had not only damaged its newly claimed territories but also had become hated by the surrounding states for its lack of defence of Protestantism.  Charles X Gustav's attempt to gain the favour of [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] by dividing Poland not only reversed his original policy, but also created a new southern rival almost as dangerous as [[Denmark-Norway|Denmark]] in the west.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}}\n\nIn 1660, after five years of warfare, Sweden had obtained peace and the opportunity to organize and develop the new vast realm. Unfortunately, the fifteen-year regency that followed Charles X Gustav was unable to manoeuvre through the situation it faced.  The administration was internally divided and hindered by the lack of unity and talent among its statesmen.  The two major rivals were the military-aristocratic party headed by [[Magnus de la Gardie]] and the party of peace and economy led by [[Johan Gyllenstierna]]. The aristocratic group prevailed and brought with it a decline of morality which made it notorious to its neighbours. The administration was noted for sloth and carelessness leading to a general neglect of business. Additionally, government corruption led Sweden to be hired by foreign powers. This \"subsidy policy\" dates from the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1661)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] of 1661, through which Sweden, in exchange for a considerable sum of money, supported the French candidate for the Polish throne. Sweden was torn between [[Louis XIV of France]] and his adversaries in plans to control the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. The anti-French faction prevailed; and in April 1668, Sweden acceded to the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], which ended the French acquisitions through the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. For the next four years, Sweden remained true to the Triple Alliance; but, in 1672, Louis XIV succeeded in isolating the [[Dutch Republic]] and regaining Sweden as an ally. By the [[Treaty of Stockholm (1672)|Treaty of Stockholm]] on April 14, 1672, Sweden entered an agreement with the French to protect its sphere of interest containing the Dutch Republic from hostile German claims in return for 400,000 Riksdaler per annum in peace and 600,000 in wartime.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}}\n\n==Scanian War==\n{{See also|Scanian War}}\n\nIn 1674, Louis XIV called upon Sweden to invade the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]]. In May 1675, a Swedish army advanced into the Mark but was defeated on June 18 at [[Battle of Fehrbellin|Fehrbellin]] and retreated to Swedish [[Demmin]]. The Fehrbellin affair was a mere [[skirmish]], with actual casualties numbering fewer than 600 men, but it made Sweden appear vulnerable and enabled neighbouring countries to attack in the [[Scanian War]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}}\n\nAt this point, the empire began to crumble. In 1675, [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[Duchy of Bremen]] were taken by the Brandenburgers, [[Austria]]ns, and Danes. In December 1677, the elector of Brandenburg captured [[Stettin]]. [[Stralsund]] fell on October 15, 1678. [[Greifswald]], Sweden's last possession on the continent, was lost on November 5. A defensive alliance with [[John III of Poland]] was rendered inoperative on August 4, 1677, by the annihilation of Sweden's sea-power; the [[Battle of \u00d6land]], June 17, 1676; the [[Battle of Fehmarn]], June 1677, and most notable on July 1-July 2 the [[Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay (1677)|Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay]].{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=204}} The difficulties concerning the Polish king continued. The Scanian provinces (Scania, Halland and Blegind/Blekinge), once eastern Denmark, became the centre of intense fighting between Swedes and Danes, with a large scale confrontation between the main armies near Lund in December 1676. After that, Scania was divided into Danish and Swedish enclaves centering around the main cities for the rest of the war. The remaining territories in Scania were mainly a no man's land where a fierce \"little war\" took place, with Swedish troops on the one side and Danish official and semi-official troops (freeshooters etc.) in conjunction with armed locals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThrough homeland military successes of the young Swedish king and the diplomatic activity of Louis XIV, a peace congress began sessions at Nijmegen in March 1677. In the beginning of April 1678, the French king dictated the terms of a peace. One of his chief conditions was the complete restitution of Sweden, as he needed a strong Swedish ally. However, Charles XI refused to go along with ceding territories to its enemies, which led the French king to negotiate on behalf of Sweden without its consent. By the [[Treaties of Nijmegen]] on February 7 and of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|St. Germain]] on June 29, 1679, Sweden received almost full restitution of its German territory. By the [[Peace of Fontainebleau]] confirmed by the subsequent [[Peace of Lund]] on September 2, [[Denmark]] was to return all the land it had captured to Sweden on October 4, 1679. While Sweden could never have gained these concessions alone, Charles XI formed a personal dislike of the French king and developed a strong anti-French bias.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==Charles XI==\n{{See also|Charles XI of Sweden}}\n\nThe remainder of the reign of [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] is remarkable for a revolution, in which the government of Sweden was transformed to a semi-absolute monarchy. The king emerged from the war convinced that if Sweden were to retain its position as a great power, it needed to reform its whole economic system radically and circumscribe the power of the aristocracy. Charles XI felt that he could do it now that he had allies in the lower orders to support him.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=205}}\n\nThe [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag]] of Stockholm, October 1680, began a new era of Swedish history. On the motion of the [[Estate of Peasants]], the question of the recovery of the alienated crown lands was brought before the Riksdag, and a resolution of the Diet directed that all [[count]]ships, [[baron]]ies, domains, [[Manorialism|manor]]s and other estates producing an annual rent of more than a certain amount per annum should revert to the Crown. The same Riksdag decided that the king was not bound by any particular [[Constitution of Sweden|constitution]], but only by law and statutes, and not even obligated to consult the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Privy Council]], but was to be regarded as a sovereign lord. The Privy Council changed its official title from [[Riksr\u00e5d]] (council of state) to [[Kungligt r\u00e5d]] (royal council); a visible sign that the councillors were no longer the king's colleagues, but rather his servants.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=205}}\n\n[[File:Charles XI of Sweden.jpg|thumb|left|King Charles XI]]\n\nThus, Sweden had become an [[absolute monarchy]] but enacted the right of the Swedish people, in [[Riksdag of the Estates|parliament]], to be consulted on all important matters. The Riksdag, completely overshadowed by the Crown, did little more than register the royal decrees during the reign of [[Charles XI of Sweden]]; but it continued to exist as an essential part of the government. Moreover, this transfer of authority was a voluntary act. The people, knowing the king to be their ally, trusted and cooperated with him.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The Riksdag of 1682 declared that the king was empowered to bestow [[fief]]s and take them back again, making the king the disposer of his subjects' temporal property. Presently, this new principle of [[autocracy]] was extended to the king's legislative authority, when on December 9, 1682, all four estates not only confirmed that the king held the legislative powers enjoyed by his predecessors, but even gave him the right of interpreting and amending the common law.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=205}}\n\nThe recovery of the alienated crown lands occupied Charles XI for the rest of his life. He created a commission, which was ultimately converted into a permanent department of state. It acted on the principle that the titles of all private landed estates might be called in question, because at some time or other they must have belonged to the Crown, and the burden of proof of ownership lay with the actual owner of the property, not the Crown. The amount of revenue accruing to the Crown from the whole \"Reduktion\" is impossible to estimate; but by these means, combined with careful management and rigid economy, Charles XI reduced the national debt by three quarters.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=205}}\n\nCharles XI re-established on a broader basis the reorganization of the \"indelningsverk\" \u2014 a system of military tenure in which national forces were bound to the soil. This tied to the \"rust hail tenure\", under which the tenants, instead of paying rent, were obliged to equip and maintain a cavalry soldier and horse; while the knekth\u00e5llare supplied duly equipped foot soldiers. Soldiers were provided with holdings on which they lived in times of peace. Formerly, ordinary conscription had existed alongside this indelning, or distribution system, but it had proved inadequate as well as highly unpopular, and in 1682, Charles XI ended it in favor of an extended distribution system. The [[Swedish Royal Navy]] was entirely remodeled; and, the recent war having demonstrated the unsuitability of [[Stockholm]] as a naval station, the construction of a new arsenal was begun at [[Karlskrona]]. After seventeen years of financial difficulties, the twofold enterprise was completed. At the death of Charles XI, Sweden could boast of a fleet of forty-three three-deckers, manned by 11,000 men and armed with 2,648 guns, and one of the finest arsenals in the world.{{sfn|Dumrath|1911|p=205}}\n\n==Charles XII and the Great Northern War==\n{{See also|Great Northern War}}\n[[File:Karl XII 1706.jpg|thumb|[[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]]]]\n\nAfter Charles XI's death, the throne was inherited by his underage son, [[Charles XII]]. After a brief regency, he was declared to be of age to rule. Three years later, in 1700, Denmark, Poland and Russia, the countries that had lost the most territory to Sweden, jointly declared war. Denmark was soon forced to peace after a joint intervention of Swedish, English and Dutch armies, whereafter the King and much of the Swedish army was shipped to the Baltic provinces, where Russian and Polish armies were laying siege to several towns. The Russian army was soundly defeated in the [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]], after which Charles took the army into Poland with the intent of dethroning the Polish king [[Augustus II of Poland|Augustus II]]. This took several years, but in 1706, with the [[Treaty of Altranst\u00e4dt (1706)|Treaty of Altranst\u00e4dt]], he reached his goal.\n\nIn the meantime, Russia had managed to take possession of several towns by the Baltic Sea. Instead of trying to retake these, Charles chose to march directly on Moscow, but due to extreme weather, difficulties with his [[supply line]]s and the Russian [[scorched earth]] strategy, he was forced to turn towards [[Ukraine]]. In 1709, the Swedish army was defeated and captured in the [[Battle of Poltava]]; Charles managed to escape south to [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Following the defeat at Poltava, Poland and Denmark re-entered the war, along with other countries wanting parts of the Swedish provinces. In the following years, most of them would fall, and Russia [[Greater Wrath|occupied the eastern half of Sweden]] (present-day [[Finland]]).\n\nDespite these setbacks, Charles XII twice tried to invade Norway to force Denmark-Norway out of the war again. On November 30, 1718, King Charles XII was mortally wounded during the [[siege of Fredriksten]] Fortress in Fredrikshald, today's [[Halden]]. With his death, Swedish war efforts mostly came to a halt, although Russia continued to harass the civilian population of the Swedish coastal areas until the concluding [[Treaty of Nystad]] was finally signed in 1721. Sweden would remain a [[regional power]] of varying success until the 19th century, but the Great Northern War put an end to Sweden's time as a great power.\n\n==Military history==\n{{History of Sweden}}\n{{see also|Military of the Swedish Empire}}\nA major reason why Sweden could be so successful in wars with such a scarce number of soldiers was its advanced military tactics. Sweden was able to reform its military tactics continuously throughout the period. Prior to Gustavus Adolphus's reforms, both his father, Charles IX, and his uncle [[Erik XIV]] had tried to reform the army but had effectively failed to do so. Charles IX, like most other rulers, had tried to implement the Dutch system{{clarify|what was this system?|date=September 2015}} into the army but with limited success. The lack of a strict organisation in the infantry caused the proportion of pikemen to musketeers to be far lower than the preferred ratio of 1 to 1. This, combined with the lack of funds to provide the soldiers with armour, caused the Swedish infantry to be dangerously lightly equipped and unable to deal with cavalry or heavier infantry in open terrain. Charles IX was, however, able to implement the Dutch system for fighting in [[caracole]] among the cavalry, with unfortunate results. His partially reformed army suffered [[Battle of Kircholm|a disastrous defeat]] at [[Kircholm]] against a Polish-Lithuanian army led by [[Jan Karol Chodkiewicz]]. The [[Hussaria]] were the last shock cavalry in Europe still fighting with [[lance]]s, yet they proved with terrifying effect the superiority of aggressive charging compared to the more defensive caracole used in the rest of Europe. In the end, Charles IX's revolt against his nephew [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund of Poland]] and subsequent rise to the throne of Sweden caused a dynastic struggle for the throne of Sweden that would not finally end until the [[treaty of Oliva]] in 1660.\n\nGustav II Adolph inherited the Polish war together with the [[Kalmar War]] against Denmark when Charles IX died in 1611. The war against Denmark was a terrible loss that forced Sweden to pay [[\u00c4lvsborg Ransom (1613)|a ransom]] of 1 million silverdaler to regain \u00c4lvsborg (final payment, 1619). The Polish war was interrupted by a series of truces caused by Sweden's weakness along with the unwillingness of the Polish nobility to fight a war considered only to be in Sigismund III's personal interest. The costly peace with Denmark and Poland-Lithuania's inability to mount a seaborne attack on the Swedish mainland gave time for Gustavus Adolphus to reform his armies. The continuation of the Polish war in 1625\u20131629 gave Gustavus Adolphus the opportunity to test and further improve his army against the Polish-Lithuanian army with its fearsome cavalry, the [[Winged Hussars]].\n\nBy the time of the [[Swedish Intervention in the Thirty Years' War]] in 1630, Gustav II Adolph had transformed the Swedish (Gustavian) army into an army in which the cavalry fought with aggressive shock tactics, closer to the Polish tactics than the [[Western Europe]]an. The [[Caracole]] and heavy armor were mostly abandoned, and the [[saber]] replaced the [[wheellock]] [[pistol]] as the primary weapon of the [[cavalry]]. Horsemen rode knee-by-knee in a tight formation. When in range, they switched to gallop and charged, and at a range of ten yards, shot both their pistols. A standard regiment numbered 250 simultaneous shots that would blast a hole in the enemy ranks. They then continued the charge with [[sabre]]s (''v\u00e4rjor''), aiming to break the enemy formation. The infantry was meanwhile employed in a defensive manner, relying on their superior firepower to break enemy attacks. Smaller musketeer detachments (~200 men) were used during the Polish war to support the cavalry against the superior Polish-Lithuanian cavalry.\nGustavus Adolphus earned the title \"father of modern warfare\" because of his revolutionary tactics during the Thirty Years' War, which later inspired other nations and became standard tactics. He became the foremost model of many later [[List of Swedish monarchs|Swedish kings]]. \n\nAt the time [[Finns]] were an essential part of the Swedish military. Roughly 2/5 of the infantry and 3/7 of the cavalry in the army were from [[Finland]].{{when?|date=December 2019}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kansallisten instituutioiden muotoutuminen \u2013 Suomalainen historiakuva Oma Maa -kirjasarjassa 1900-1960|last=Karonen, Petri and R\u00e4ih\u00e4 Antti (edit.)|first=|publisher=Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura|year=2014|isbn=978-952-222-606-8|location=Vantaa|pages=160}}</ref> They served in their own units which used [[Finnish language|Finnish]] as their main language.

Taking into account the contemporary number of inhabitants in Finland, it was relatively same than one million casulties in the 20th Century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Murhanenkeli|last=Keskisarja|first=Teemu|publisher=Siltala|year=2019|isbn=9789522346384|location=Helsinki|pages=246}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Attributed to Jacob Hoefnagel - Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden 1611-1632 - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]].]]\n\nThroughout the Thirty Years' War, the infantry's shock ability was continuously improved. The static nature of the infantry that served well against the cavalry-dominated Polish-Lithuanian army was enhanced during the war to produce infantry capable of both providing devastating firepower and executing offensive maneuvers. Initially, at the [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)]], the infantry was almost entirely reliant on their firepower and saw very limited offensive use; but under the leadership of [[Johan Ban\u00e9r]], who took command after the defeat at N\u00f6rdlingen, the Gustavian brigade system was finally changed into the battalion system recognisable from the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and the Great Nordic War (the depth was lowered from six ranks to three or four when the bayonet was introduced at the end of the 17th century).\n\nSwedish tactics once again greatly diverged from the continental tactics during the second half of the 17th century. The continental tactics increasingly emphasized the firepower of the battalion, while the Swedish ([[Caroleans|Carolean]]) tactics almost exclusively relied on the shock factor as the infantry and cavalry charged the enemy. As the bayonet was introduced, the pike was discarded in all armies except the Swedish and Russian by 1700.\n\nIn the Swedish army tactics of that time, retreat was never covered, and they were obliged to attack or fight where they stood. This was a military doctrine that (with the advantage of hindsight) might have proven a bit rash.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nThe infantry shock attack operated as follows. The two rear ranks of musketeers were ordered to shoot when \"you could not miss,\" a range of roughly 50 meters, and then to draw their swords before the battalion resumed their attack. The two foremost ranks then discharged at a range of roughly 20 meters before drawing their swords, and the charge began. At this range, the powerful [[musket]]s usually felled many enemy troops and was demoralising to them. Directly after the volley, the Swedes charged the enemy ranks with [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]s, [[bayonet]]s and sabres. Note that the pikes were used as an offensive weapon: in close combat, they had the advantage over their foes' weapons thanks to their range. After the bayonet was introduced in the Carolean army (1700\u20131706), the final volley was delayed until the soldiers were inside bayonet range.\n\nEvery infantry battalion had [[grenadier]]s attached. They supported the infantry attack by lobbing [[grenade]]s from the flanks. They also formed units of their own. They were otherwise equipped like infantry.\n\nThus, in the latter half of the 17th century, the major difference between the Swedish army and those common on the continent was the relative lack of firepower and the use of pikes and sabres. Sweden and Russia were the only countries at the time using pikes. In contemporary Europe, infantry were equipped with a musket, while in the Swedish army, every third man had a pike. The pikemen were normally deployed four men deep with musketeers of equal depth on the sides. The pike was used to repulse cavalry and to break the enemy lines as they charged.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Finland]]\n* [[History of Norway]]\n* [[History of Denmark]]\n* [[History of Estonia]]\n* [[History of Latvia]]\n* [[History of Pomerania]]\n* [[Swedish overseas colonies]]\n* [[Military of the Swedish Empire]]\n\n==References==\n{{More footnotes|date=May 2019}}\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{EB1911 |wstitle=Sweden |volume=26 |pages=188\u2013221 |first=Oskar Henrik |last=Dumrath}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last= Andersson |first= Ingvar |title= A History of Sweden |year= 1956 |publisher= Praeger |location= New York}}  [https://archive.org/details/historyofsweden00ande free to borrow for two weeks] pp 153\u2013237\n* Bain, R.

He played as a youth for two clubs in his hometown, [[Viktoria DJK Coburg]] and [[VfB Coburg]], before joining [[TSV Vestenbergsgreuth]]. TSV merged with [[SpVgg F\u00fcrth]] in 1996, forming [[SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth]], with whom Forkel would make his breakthrough in the professional game.\n\n===Southern Germany===\nForkel made one appearance for [[SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth]], as a substitute for [[Arie van Lent]] in a 3\u20131 win over [[FSV Mainz]] in the [[2. Bundesliga]] in December 1998. He was released by the club at the end of the 1998\u201399 season, signing for [[Borussia Fulda]] of the [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1994\u20132012)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. Fulda were relegated in Forkel's only season with the club, finishing 17th, but he was to stay at the third tier, signing for [[Wacker Burghausen]] in July 2000.\n\nIn Forkel's first season with Burghausen, the club battled against relegation, but were promoted as champions in 2001\u201302, with Forkel and ever-present. He would go on to play for the club for four seasons in the 2. Bundesliga, achieving a mid-table finish each time, before leaving to join [[TuS Koblenz]] in July 2006.\n\n===Western Germany===\nForkel made his debut for [[TuS Koblenz]] on the opening day of the 2006\u201307 season, as a substitute for [[R\u00fcdiger Ziehl]] in a 2\u20131 defeat against [[MSV Duisburg]]. As at Burghausen, he would play for four seasons in the [[2. Bundesliga]], although his appearances were more restricted, and his time at Koblenz ended with the club being relegated to the [[3. Liga]] in 2010.\n\nForkel then joined another 3. Liga club, [[1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken]], where he would spend the next two seasons as a regular in the first team. He was released by the club in 2012, and spent a year with [[Borussia Neunkirchen]] of the [[Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar]]. In July 2013 he returned to Saarbr\u00fccken, originally to play for [[1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken II|their reserve team]], but after coach [[J\u00fcrgen Luginger]] was replaced with [[Milan \u0160a\u0161i\u0107]] he was brought back into the first-team fold. He made his second debut for the club in September 2013 as a substitute for [[Philipp Hoffmann (footballer)|Philipp Hoffmann]] in a 1\u20130 defeat to [[SV Darmstadt 98]], and remained a first-team regular until the end of the season, which saw Saarbr\u00fccken relegated. Forkel then left the club for a second time.\n\n===International career===\nForkel was in the [[Germany national under-20 football team|Germany]] squad for the [[1999 FIFA World Youth Championship]], and made six appearances for the [[Germany national under-21 football team|under-21 team]] that same year.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Fussballdaten|forkelmartin|Martin Forkel}}\n\n{{1.

The current Leader of the Opposition is Sir [[Keir Starmer]], Leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who was elected to the leadership of the Labour Party on 12 September 2015.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34223157 | title=Jeremy Corbyn wins Labour leadership contest | publisher=BBC | date=12 September 2015 | accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition is normally viewed as an alternative or shadow [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], and is appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. They lead an [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet]] which scrutinises the actions of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] led by the Prime Minister, as well as offer alternative policies.\n\nThere is also a Leader of the Opposition in the [[House of Lords]] (currently [[Angela Smith, Baroness Smith of Basildon|The Baroness Smith of Basildon]]). In the nineteenth century party affiliations were generally less fixed and leaders in the two Houses were often of equal status. A single, clear Leader of the Opposition was only definitively settled if the opposition leader in Commons or Lords was the outgoing prime minister. However, since the [[Parliament Act 1911]] there has been no dispute that the leader in the House of Commons is pre-eminent and has always held the main title.\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition is entitled to a salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]]. In 2010, this additional entitlement was available up to \u00a373,617.<ref name=\"salary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/m06.pdf|title=parliament.uk|date=May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430063450/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/M06.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2010|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Leaders of the Opposition from 1807==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nThe first modern Leader of the Opposition was [[Charles James Fox]], who led the Whigs as such for a generation, except during the [[Fox\u2013North Coalition]] in 1783. He finally rejoined the government in 1806, and died later that year.\n[[File:Charles James Fox by Karl Anton Hickel.jpg|thumb|220px|Charles James Fox, Leader of the Opposition 1783\u20131806]]\n\n===Early developments 1807\u201330===\nFor there to be a recognised Leader of the Opposition, it is necessary for there to be a sufficiently cohesive opposition to need a formal leader.  The emergence of the office thus coincided with the period when wholly united parties ([[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] and [[Tory Party|Tory]], governments and oppositions) became the norm.<ref name=foord>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Oxford University Press (1964), 494 pages {{ISBN|0198213115}}.</ref> This situation was normalised in the Parliament of 1807\u20131812, when the members of the Grenvillite and Foxite Whig factions resolved to maintain a joint, dual-house leadership for the whole party.\n\nThe [[Ministry of all the Talents]], in which both Whig factions participated fell at the [[1807 United Kingdom general election|1807 general election]], during which the Whigs had re-adopted traditional factions, forming ''an'' opposition.  The prime minister of the Talents ministry, [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] had led his eponymous faction from the [[House of Lords]].  Meanwhile, the government leader of the House of Commons, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Viscount Howick]] (later known as Earl Grey and the political heir of [[Charles James Fox]] who had died in 1806), led his faction, the Foxite whigs, from the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nHowick's father, [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|the 1st Earl Grey]] died on 14 November 1807. As such the new Earl Grey vacated his seat in the House of Commons and moved to the House of Lords. This left no obvious Whig leader in the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nGrenville's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' confirms that he was  considered the Whig leader in the House of Lords between 1807 and 1817, despite Grey leading the larger faction.\n\nGrenville and Grey, political historian Archibald Foord describes as being \"[[duumvirate|duumvirs]] of the party from 1807 to 1817\" and consulted about what was to be done. Grenville was at first reluctant to name a Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, commenting \"... all the elections in the world would not have made Windham or Sheridan leaders of the old Opposition while Fox was alive ...\".\n\nEventually they jointly recommended [[George Ponsonby]] to the Whig MPs, whom they accepted as the first Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. Ponsonby, an Irish lawyer who was the uncle of Grey's wife, had been [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] during the Ministry of all the Talents and had only just been re-elected to the House of Commons in 1808 when he became leader.<ref name=foord/> Ponsonby proved a weak leader but as he could not be persuaded to resign and the duumvirs did not want to depose him, he remained in place until he died in 1817.<ref name=foord/>\n\nLord Grenville retired from active politics in 1817, leaving Grey as the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. Grey was not a former prime minister in 1817, unlike Grenville, so under the convention that developed later in the century he would have been in theory of equal status to whoever was leader in the other House. However, there was little doubt that if a Whig ministry was possible, Grey rather than the less distinguished Commons leaders would have been invited to form that government. In this respect Grey's position was like that of the Earl of Derby in the Protectionist Conservative opposition of the late 1840s and early 1850s.<ref name=foord/>\n\nEarl Grey witnessed a delay of about a year, until 1818, before a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was chosen. This was [[George Tierney]] who was reluctant to accept the leadership and had weak support from his party.  On 18 May 1819, Tierney moved a motion in the Commons for a committee on the state of the nation. This motion was defeated by 357 to 178, a division involving the largest number of MPs until the debates over the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform bill in the early 1830s]]. Foord comments that \"this defeat put an effective end to Tierney's leadership ... Tierney did not disclaim the leadership till 23 Jan. 1821 ..., but he had ceased to exercise its functions since the great defeat\".\n\nBetween 1821 and 1830 the Whig Commons leadership was left vacant. The leadership in the House of Lords was not much more effective: in 1824 Grey retired from active leadership, asking the party to follow the [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Marquess of Lansdowne]] \"as the person whom his friends were to look upon as their leader\". Lansdowne disclaimed the title of leader, although in practice he performed the function.\n\nFollowing the retirement of [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] from the prime ministership in 1827, the party political situation changed. Neither the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] or [[Robert Peel]] agreed to serve under [[George Canning]] and they were followed by five other members of the former Cabinet as well as forty junior members of the previous government. The Tory Party was heavily split between the \"High Tories\" (or \"Ultras\", nicknamed after [[Ultra-royalist|the contemporary party]] in France) and the moderates supporting Canning, often called '[[Canningites]]'. As a result, Canning found it difficult to maintain a government and chose to invite a number of Whigs to join his Cabinet, including [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]. After Canning's death, [[Frederick Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]] continued the coalition for a few more months.The principal opposition between April 1827 and January 1828 worked with these brief administrations, although Earl Grey and a section of the Whigs were also in opposition to the coalition government.  It was during this period that the term \"His Majesty's Opposition\" for the Opposition was coined, by [[John Cam Hobhouse]].<ref>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Greenwood Press, 1979, 494 pages, page 1.</ref>\n\nThe Duke of Wellington formed a ministry in January 1828 and as a direct effect of adopting in earnest the policy of [[Catholic Emancipation]] the opposition became composed of most Whigs with many Canningites and some ultra-Tories. Lord Lansdowne, in the absence of any alternative, remained the leading figure in the Whig opposition.\n\nIn 1830 Grey returned to the front rank of politics. On 30 June 1830 he denounced the government in the House of Lords. He rapidly attracted the support of opponents of the ministry. The renewal of organised opposition was also bolstered earlier in the year by the election of a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, the heir of Earl Spencer, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Viscount Althorp]].\n\nIn November 1830 Grey was invited to form a government and resumed the formal leadership of the party and as such Wellington and Peel became the Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses, from November 1830.\n\n===Leaders of the Opposition 1830\u20131937===\n\nIn the period of 1830\u20131937 the normal expectation was that there would be two leading parties (often with smaller allied groups), of which one would form the government and the other the opposition.<ref>The discussion in this section is based upon ''British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900'' and ''Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900\u20132000.</ref> These parties were expected to have recognised leaders in the two Houses, so there was normally no problem in identifying who led the opposition in each House.\n\nThe constitutional convention developed in the nineteenth century was that if one of the leaders was the last prime minister of the party, then he would be considered the overall leader of his party. If that was not the case then the leaders of both Houses were of equal status. As the monarch retained some discretion as to which leader should be invited to form a ministry, it was not always obvious in advance which one would be called upon to do so.\n\nHowever, as the Leadership of the Opposition only existed by custom, the normal expectations and conventions were modified by political realities from time to time.\n\nFrom 1830 until 1846 the [[Tory Party|Tory]]/[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party and the [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig Party]] (increasingly often described with its [[Radical Party (UK)|Radical]] and other allies as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]) alternated in power and provided clear Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1846 the Conservative Party split into (Protectionist) Conservative and [[Peelite]] (or Liberal Conservative) factions. The Protectionists being the larger group, the recognised Leaders of the Opposition were drawn from their ranks. In the House of Lords, Lord Stanley (soon becoming [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]]) was the Protectionist leader. He was the only established front rank political figure in the faction and thus a very strong candidate to form the next Conservative ministry.\n\nThe leadership in the House of Commons was more problematic. [[Lord George Bentinck]], the leader of the Protectionist revolt against Sir Robert Peel, initially led the party in the Commons. He resigned in December 1847. The party was then faced with the problem of how to produce a credible leader, who was not [[Benjamin Disraeli]].  The first attempt to square the circle, was made in February 1848, when the young [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Marquess of Granby]] was installed as the leader. He gave up the post in March 1848. The leadership then fell vacant until February 1849.\n\nThe next experiment was to entrust the leadership to a [[triumvirate]] of Granby, Disraeli and the elderly [[John Charles Herries]]. In practice Disraeli ignored his co-triumvirs. In 1851 Granby resigned and the party accepted Disraeli as the sole leader. The Protectionists by then were clearly the core of the Conservative Party and Derby was able to form his first government in 1852.\n\nThe Liberal Party was formally founded in 1859, replacing the Whig Party as one of the two leading parties. With increasing party discipline it became easier to define the principal opposition party and the Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nThe last overall Leader of the Opposition to have led it from the House of Lords was the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]]. He resigned as such in November 1896.  Lord Rosebery had been [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] prime minister from 1894 to 1895.\n\n[[File:Andrew Bonar Law Vanity Fair 10 April 1912.jpg|thumb|right|<center>\"the opposition\"<center>[[Bonar Law]] as caricatured in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 1912</center>]]\nThe [[Parliament Act 1911]] removed the [[legislature|legislative]] veto from the [[House of Lords]] to permit the welfare-state forming [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] legislation to be enacted by the Commons, the [[People's Budget]] and any future [[Money Bill]]s without any input from the Lords.  This therefore entrenched the de facto position that there could only be one true Leader of the Opposition and in effect clarified in which house that leader would need to sit.  From this point, all Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons would thus be overall Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1915 the Liberal, Conservative and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties formed a coalition. The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] did not join the government but were by and large not in opposition to it. As almost nobody in the Parliament could be said to be in opposition to the coalition, the leaderships of the opposition in both Houses fell vacant.\n\n[[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure among the Irish Unionist part of the Conservative and Unionist Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n\nThe party situation changed in December 1916: a leading Liberal, [[David Lloyd George]], formed a coalition with the support of a section of \"Coalition Liberal\", Conservative and Labour parties. The Liberal leader, [[H. H. Asquith]], and most of his leading colleagues left the government and took up seats on the opposition side of the House of Commons. Asquith was recognised as the Leader of the Opposition. He retained that post until he was defeated in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election]]. Although Asquith continued to be the leader of the Liberal Party, as he was not a member of the House of Commons he was not eligible to be Leader of the Opposition.\n\nThe Parliament elected in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|December 1918]] which sat from 1919 until 1922, represents the most significant deviation from the principle that the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the party not in government with the greatest numerical support in the House of Commons. The largest opposition party (disregarding [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], whose MPs did not take their seats at Westminster), was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] which had wholly left the Lloyd George coalition and won 57 seats at the general election. Thirty six Liberals had been elected without coalition support however were mixed in their opposition to Lloyd George. The Labour Party did not have a leader until 1922. The Parliamentary Labour Party annually elected a chairman, but the party, due to its congressional origins, refused to assert a claim that the chairman was the Leader of the Opposition. Although the issue of who was entitled to be Leader of the Opposition was never formally resolved, in practice the Opposition Liberal leader performed most of the parliamentary functions associated with the office.\n\nThe small group of opposition Liberals met in 1919, distanced by his coalition's protectionism and nationalization. They resolved that they were the Liberal Parliamentary Party. They elected [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald Maclean]] as Chairman of the Parliamentary Party. Liberal Party practice at the time, when the overall Leader of the Party had lost an election to the House of Commons, was for the chairman to function as acting leader in the House. Maclean therefore took on the role of Leader of the Opposition, followed by Asquith, who returned to the House by winning a [[1920 Paisley by-election|by-election]] (1920\u201322).\n\nFrom 1922 the Labour Party had a recognised leader so took over all remaining commons opposition roles from the Opposition Liberal Party.  Since 1922 the principal Government and Opposition parties have been the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].  There were three instances of peers being seriously considered for the prime ministership, during the twentieth century ([[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon of Kedleston]] in 1923, [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Halifax]] in 1940 and [[Alec Douglas-Home|Home]] in 1963), but these were all cases where the Conservative Party was in government and do not affect the list of Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1931\u201332 the Leader of the Labour Party was [[Arthur Henderson]]. He was Leader of the Opposition for a short period in 1931, but was ineligible to continue when he lost his seat in the 1931 general election. [[George Lansbury]] was Leader of the Opposition before he also became the Leader of the Labour Party in 1932.\n\n===Statutory Leaders of the Opposition from 1937===\nLeaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament had been generally recognised and given a special status in Parliament for more than a century before they were mentioned in legislation.\n\n''[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice]]'' confirms that the office of Leader of the Opposition was first given statutory recognition in the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1937]].\n\n* Section 5 states that \"There shall be paid to the Leader of the Opposition an annual salary of two thousand pounds\".\n* Section 10(1) includes a definition (which codifies the usual situation under the previous custom)  \"Leader of the Opposition\" means that member of the House of Commons who is for the time being the leader in that House of the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in that House\".\n* The 1937 Act also contains an important provision to decide who is the Leader of the Opposition, if this is in doubt. Under section 10(3) \"If any doubt arises as to which is or was at any material time the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons, or as to who is or was at any material time the leader in that House of such a party the question shall be decided for the purposes of this Act by the Speaker of the House of Commons, and his decision, certified in writing under his hand, shall be final and conclusive\".\n\nSubsequent legislation also gave statutory recognition to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\n* Section 2(1) of the [[Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975]], provides that \"In this Act \"Leader of the Opposition\" means, in relation to either House of Parliament, that member of that House who is for the time being the Leader in that House of the party in opposition to Her Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons\".\n* Section 2(2) is in exactly the same terms as section 10(3) of the 1937 Act (apart from substituting Her Majesty's for His Majesty's).\n* Section 2(3) is a corresponding provision for the [[Lord Chancellor]] (since 2005, the [[Lord Speaker]]) to decide about the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\nThe legislative provisions confirm that Leader of the Opposition is, strictly, a Parliamentary office; so that to be leader a person must be a member of the House in which he or she leads.\n\nSince 1937 the Leader of the Opposition has received a state salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), now equivalent to a Cabinet Minister. The holder also receives a [[chauffeur]]-driven car for official business of equivalent cost and specification to the vehicles used by most [[minister (government)|cabinet ministers]].\n\nIn 1940 the three largest parties in the House of Commons formed a coalition government to continue to prosecute the Second World War. This coalition continued in office until shortly after the defeat of Germany in 1945. As the former Leader of the Opposition had joined the government the issue arose of who was to hold the office or perform its functions. ''Keesing's Contemporary Archives 1937\u20131940'' (at paragraph 4069D) reported the situation, based on ''[[Hansard]]'':\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Prime Minister replying to Mr Denman in the House of Commons on 21 May, said that in view of the formation of an Administration embracing the three main political parties, H.M. Government was of the opinion that the provision of the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, relating to the payment of a salary to the Leader of the Opposition was in abeyance for the time being, as there was no alternative party capable of forming a Government. He added that he did not consider amending legislation necessary.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' reported that the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] met on 22 May 1940 and unanimously elected Dr [[Hastings Bertrand Lees-Smith|H.B. Lees-Smith]] as Chairman of the PLP (an office normally held by the party leader at that time) and as spokesman of the Party from the opposition front bench.\n\nAfter the death of Lees-Smith, on 18 December 1941, the PLP held a meeting on 21 January 1942. [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence]] was unanimously elected Chairman of the PLP and the official spokesman of the party in the House of Commons while the party leader was serving in the government. After the deputy leader of the party ([[Arthur Greenwood]]) left the government on 22 February 1942 he took over these roles from Pethick-Lawrence until the end of the coalition and the resumption of normal party politics.\n\n==List of Leaders of the Opposition==\nThe table lists the people who were, or who acted as, Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament since 1807, prior to which the post was held by [[Charles James Fox]] for decades.\n\nThe leaders of the two Houses were of equal status, before 1911, unless one was the most recent Prime Minister for the party. Such a former prime minister was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. From 1911 the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. Overall leaders names are bolded. Acting leaders names are in italics unless the acting leader subsequently became a full leader during a continuous period as leader.\n\nDue to the fragmentation of both principal parties in 1827\u201330, the leaders and principal opposition parties suggested for those years are provisional.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!colspan=2|Principal party<br />of

This may possibly have also been the case in 1828\u201330. Grey's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' suggests \"... though he called on Lansdowne to take up the leadership of the opposition he was still unwilling to give it up altogether\". Grey was in opposition in 1827\u201328, when Lansdowne was in government. Given the confusion of the politics of the period, particularly after 1827 when both principal parties were fragmented, it is possible that Grey should be considered Leader of the Opposition 1824\u20131830. However the definite statements (by Foord) that Grey resigned the leadership in 1824 and (by Cook & Keith) that Grey did not resume the leadership until November 1830 leads to a different conclusion.\n: {{note label|B|B|B}} An alternative interpretation is that Palmerston (the immediate past Prime Minister) and Lord John Russell (a previous Prime Minister) were joint leaders. Cook & Keith have Palmerston as the sole leader.\n: {{note label|C|C|C}} Harcourt resigned 14 December 1898.\n: {{note label|D|D|D}} Rosebery resigned 6 October 1896.\n: {{note label|E|E|E}} Balfour lost his seat in the House of Commons in January 1906.\n: {{note label|F|F|F}} During Asquith's coalition government of 1915\u20131916, there was no formal opposition in either the Commons or the Lords. The only party not in Asquith's Liberal, Conservative, Labour Coalition was the Irish Nationalist Party led by [[John Redmond]]. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition. [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure amongst the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n: {{note label|G|G|G}} Asquith lost his seat in the House of Commons in December 1918.\n: {{note label|H|H|H}} Douglas in ''The History of the Liberal Party 1895\u20131970'' observes that \"The technical question whether the Leader of the Opposition was Maclean or [[William Adamson]], Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, was never fully resolved ... The fact that Adamson did not press his claim for Opposition leadership is of more than technical interest, for it shows that the Labour Party was still not taking itself seriously as a likely alternative government\".\n: {{note label|I|I|I}} The Labour Party did not appoint a leader in the Lords until it formed its first government in 1924.\n: {{note label|J|J|J}} Henderson lost his seat in the House of Commons on 27 October 1931.\n: {{note label|K|K|K}} Lansbury was acting as leader, in the absence from the House of Commons of Henderson, in 1931\u20131932; before becoming party leader himself in 1932.\n: {{note label|L|L|L}} Attlee was acting as leader, after the resignation of Lansbury on 25 October 1935, before being elected party leader himself on 3 December 1935.\n: {{note label|M|M|M}} During World War II a succession of three Labour politicians acted as Leader of the Opposition for the purpose of allowing the House of Commons to function normally, however as in the mid World War I ministry, opposition did not run under a party-whipped system. As the Government 1940\u201345 was a coalition government in which Labour politicians functioned fully as members of the Government: neither [[Deputy Prime Minister (UK)|Deputy Prime Minister]] Clement Attlee nor these three received the salary for the post of Leader of the Opposition. The largest party that opposed the war and was not part of the coalition \u2013 and therefore, in theory, the opposition was the [[Independent Labour Party]] led by [[James Maxton]]. With only three MPs, it tried to take over the opposition frontbench but was widely opposed in this venture.\n: {{note label|N|N|N}} Lord Addison was not a member of the wartime coalition government. When Labour was part of the government from May 1940 until May 1945, Addison functioned as a formal, procedural Opposition Leader, in the same way as the acting Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons.\n: {{note label|O|O|O}} Viscount Cranborne is the main subsidiary title to the [[Marquess of Salisbury]] given to its heir. Two Lords Cranborne have been Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.

Before 1981 the leader, in opposition, was elected annually by the parliamentary Labour Party. From 1981 to 2010, the leader was elected by an electoral college of party members, MPs and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], as well as [[trade unions]] before the party switched to a true [[one member, one vote]] system in 2015.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[List of Leaders of the Opposition of the United Kingdom by length of tenure]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''British Historical Facts 1760\u20131830'', by Chris Cook and John Stevenson (The Macmillan Press 1980)\n* ''British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900'', by Chris Cook and Brendan Keith (The Macmillan Press 1975)\n* ''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', by Archibald S.

In the nineteenth century party affiliations were generally less fixed and leaders in the two Houses were often of equal status. A single, clear Leader of the Opposition was only definitively settled if the opposition leader in Commons or Lords was the outgoing prime minister. However, since the [[Parliament Act 1911]] there has been no dispute that the leader in the House of Commons is pre-eminent and has always held the main title.\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition is entitled to a salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]].

The emergence of the office thus coincided with the period when wholly united parties ([[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] and [[Tory Party|Tory]], governments and oppositions) became the norm.<ref name=foord>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Oxford University Press (1964), 494 pages {{ISBN|0198213115}}.</ref> This situation was normalised in the Parliament of 1807\u20131812, when the members of the Grenvillite and Foxite Whig factions resolved to maintain a joint, dual-house leadership for the whole party.\n\nThe [[Ministry of all the Talents]], in which both Whig factions participated fell at the [[1807 United Kingdom general election|1807 general election]], during which the Whigs had re-adopted traditional factions, forming ''an'' opposition.  The prime minister of the Talents ministry, [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] had led his eponymous faction from the [[House of Lords]].  Meanwhile, the government leader of the House of Commons, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Viscount Howick]] (later known as Earl Grey and the political heir of [[Charles James Fox]] who had died in 1806), led his faction, the Foxite whigs, from the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nHowick's father, [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|the 1st Earl Grey]] died on 14 November 1807. As such the new Earl Grey vacated his seat in the House of Commons and moved to the House of Lords. This left no obvious Whig leader in the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nGrenville's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' confirms that he was  considered the Whig leader in the House of Lords between 1807 and 1817, despite Grey leading the larger faction.\n\nGrenville and Grey, political historian Archibald Foord describes as being \"[[duumvirate|duumvirs]] of the party from 1807 to 1817\" and consulted about what was to be done. Grenville was at first reluctant to name a Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, commenting \"... all the elections in the world would not have made Windham or Sheridan leaders of the old Opposition while Fox was alive ...\".\n\nEventually they jointly recommended [[George Ponsonby]] to the Whig MPs, whom they accepted as the first Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. Ponsonby, an Irish lawyer who was the uncle of Grey's wife, had been [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] during the Ministry of all the Talents and had only just been re-elected to the House of Commons in 1808 when he became leader.<ref name=foord/> Ponsonby proved a weak leader but as he could not be persuaded to resign and the duumvirs did not want to depose him, he remained in place until he died in 1817.<ref name=foord/>\n\nLord Grenville retired from active politics in 1817, leaving Grey as the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. Grey was not a former prime minister in 1817, unlike Grenville, so under the convention that developed later in the century he would have been in theory of equal status to whoever was leader in the other House. However, there was little doubt that if a Whig ministry was possible, Grey rather than the less distinguished Commons leaders would have been invited to form that government. In this respect Grey's position was like that of the Earl of Derby in the Protectionist Conservative opposition of the late 1840s and early 1850s.<ref name=foord/>\n\nEarl Grey witnessed a delay of about a year, until 1818, before a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was chosen. This was [[George Tierney]] who was reluctant to accept the leadership and had weak support from his party.  On 18 May 1819, Tierney moved a motion in the Commons for a committee on the state of the nation. This motion was defeated by 357 to 178, a division involving the largest number of MPs until the debates over the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform bill in the early 1830s]]. Foord comments that \"this defeat put an effective end to Tierney's leadership ... Tierney did not disclaim the leadership till 23 Jan. 1821 ..., but he had ceased to exercise its functions since the great defeat\".\n\nBetween 1821 and 1830 the Whig Commons leadership was left vacant. The leadership in the House of Lords was not much more effective: in 1824 Grey retired from active leadership, asking the party to follow the [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Marquess of Lansdowne]] \"as the person whom his friends were to look upon as their leader\". Lansdowne disclaimed the title of leader, although in practice he performed the function.\n\nFollowing the retirement of [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] from the prime ministership in 1827, the party political situation changed. Neither the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] or [[Robert Peel]] agreed to serve under [[George Canning]] and they were followed by five other members of the former Cabinet as well as forty junior members of the previous government. The Tory Party was heavily split between the \"High Tories\" (or \"Ultras\", nicknamed after [[Ultra-royalist|the contemporary party]] in France) and the moderates supporting Canning, often called '[[Canningites]]'. As a result, Canning found it difficult to maintain a government and chose to invite a number of Whigs to join his Cabinet, including [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]. After Canning's death, [[Frederick Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]] continued the coalition for a few more months.The principal opposition between April 1827 and January 1828 worked with these brief administrations, although Earl Grey and a section of the Whigs were also in opposition to the coalition government.  It was during this period that the term \"His Majesty's Opposition\" for the Opposition was coined, by [[John Cam Hobhouse]].<ref>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Greenwood Press, 1979, 494 pages, page 1.</ref>\n\nThe Duke of Wellington formed a ministry in January 1828 and as a direct effect of adopting in earnest the policy of [[Catholic Emancipation]] the opposition became composed of most Whigs with many Canningites and some ultra-Tories. Lord Lansdowne, in the absence of any alternative, remained the leading figure in the Whig opposition.\n\nIn 1830 Grey returned to the front rank of politics. On 30 June 1830 he denounced the government in the House of Lords. He rapidly attracted the support of opponents of the ministry. The renewal of organised opposition was also bolstered earlier in the year by the election of a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, the heir of Earl Spencer, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Viscount Althorp]].\n\nIn November 1830 Grey was invited to form a government and resumed the formal leadership of the party and as such Wellington and Peel became the Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses, from November 1830.\n\n===Leaders of the Opposition 1830\u20131937===\n\nIn the period of 1830\u20131937 the normal expectation was that there would be two leading parties (often with smaller allied groups), of which one would form the government and the other the opposition.<ref>The discussion in this section is based upon ''British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900'' and ''Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900\u20132000.</ref> These parties were expected to have recognised leaders in the two Houses, so there was normally no problem in identifying who led the opposition in each House.\n\nThe constitutional convention developed in the nineteenth century was that if one of the leaders was the last prime minister of the party, then he would be considered the overall leader of his party. If that was not the case then the leaders of both Houses were of equal status. As the monarch retained some discretion as to which leader should be invited to form a ministry, it was not always obvious in advance which one would be called upon to do so.\n\nHowever, as the Leadership of the Opposition only existed by custom, the normal expectations and conventions were modified by political realities from time to time.\n\nFrom 1830 until 1846 the [[Tory Party|Tory]]/[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party and the [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig Party]] (increasingly often described with its [[Radical Party (UK)|Radical]] and other allies as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]) alternated in power and provided clear Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1846 the Conservative Party split into (Protectionist) Conservative and [[Peelite]] (or Liberal Conservative) factions. The Protectionists being the larger group, the recognised Leaders of the Opposition were drawn from their ranks. In the House of Lords, Lord Stanley (soon becoming [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]]) was the Protectionist leader. He was the only established front rank political figure in the faction and thus a very strong candidate to form the next Conservative ministry.\n\nThe leadership in the House of Commons was more problematic. [[Lord George Bentinck]], the leader of the Protectionist revolt against Sir Robert Peel, initially led the party in the Commons. He resigned in December 1847. The party was then faced with the problem of how to produce a credible leader, who was not [[Benjamin Disraeli]].  The first attempt to square the circle, was made in February 1848, when the young [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Marquess of Granby]] was installed as the leader. He gave up the post in March 1848. The leadership then fell vacant until February 1849.\n\nThe next experiment was to entrust the leadership to a [[triumvirate]] of Granby, Disraeli and the elderly [[John Charles Herries]]. In practice Disraeli ignored his co-triumvirs. In 1851 Granby resigned and the party accepted Disraeli as the sole leader. The Protectionists by then were clearly the core of the Conservative Party and Derby was able to form his first government in 1852.\n\nThe Liberal Party was formally founded in 1859, replacing the Whig Party as one of the two leading parties. With increasing party discipline it became easier to define the principal opposition party and the Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nThe last overall Leader of the Opposition to have led it from the House of Lords was the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]]. He resigned as such in November 1896.  Lord Rosebery had been [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] prime minister from 1894 to 1895.\n\n[[File:Andrew Bonar Law Vanity Fair 10 April 1912.jpg|thumb|right|<center>\"the opposition\"<center>[[Bonar Law]] as caricatured in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 1912</center>]]\nThe [[Parliament Act 1911]] removed the [[legislature|legislative]] veto from the [[House of Lords]] to permit the welfare-state forming [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] legislation to be enacted by the Commons, the [[People's Budget]] and any future [[Money Bill]]s without any input from the Lords.  This therefore entrenched the de facto position that there could only be one true Leader of the Opposition and in effect clarified in which house that leader would need to sit.  From this point, all Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons would thus be overall Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1915 the Liberal, Conservative and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties formed a coalition. The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] did not join the government but were by and large not in opposition to it. As almost nobody in the Parliament could be said to be in opposition to the coalition, the leaderships of the opposition in both Houses fell vacant.\n\n[[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure among the Irish Unionist part of the Conservative and Unionist Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n\nThe party situation changed in December 1916: a leading Liberal, [[David Lloyd George]], formed a coalition with the support of a section of \"Coalition Liberal\", Conservative and Labour parties. The Liberal leader, [[H. H. Asquith]], and most of his leading colleagues left the government and took up seats on the opposition side of the House of Commons. Asquith was recognised as the Leader of the Opposition. He retained that post until he was defeated in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election]]. Although Asquith continued to be the leader of the Liberal Party, as he was not a member of the House of Commons he was not eligible to be Leader of the Opposition.\n\nThe Parliament elected in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|December 1918]] which sat from 1919 until 1922, represents the most significant deviation from the principle that the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the party not in government with the greatest numerical support in the House of Commons. The largest opposition party (disregarding [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], whose MPs did not take their seats at Westminster), was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] which had wholly left the Lloyd George coalition and won 57 seats at the general election. Thirty six Liberals had been elected without coalition support however were mixed in their opposition to Lloyd George. The Labour Party did not have a leader until 1922. The Parliamentary Labour Party annually elected a chairman, but the party, due to its congressional origins, refused to assert a claim that the chairman was the Leader of the Opposition. Although the issue of who was entitled to be Leader of the Opposition was never formally resolved, in practice the Opposition Liberal leader performed most of the parliamentary functions associated with the office.\n\nThe small group of opposition Liberals met in 1919, distanced by his coalition's protectionism and nationalization. They resolved that they were the Liberal Parliamentary Party. They elected [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald Maclean]] as Chairman of the Parliamentary Party. Liberal Party practice at the time, when the overall Leader of the Party had lost an election to the House of Commons, was for the chairman to function as acting leader in the House. Maclean therefore took on the role of Leader of the Opposition, followed by Asquith, who returned to the House by winning a [[1920 Paisley by-election|by-election]] (1920\u201322).\n\nFrom 1922 the Labour Party had a recognised leader so took over all remaining commons opposition roles from the Opposition Liberal Party.  Since 1922 the principal Government and Opposition parties have been the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].  There were three instances of peers being seriously considered for the prime ministership, during the twentieth century ([[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon of Kedleston]] in 1923, [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Halifax]] in 1940 and [[Alec Douglas-Home|Home]] in 1963), but these were all cases where the Conservative Party was in government and do not affect the list of Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1931\u201332 the Leader of the Labour Party was [[Arthur Henderson]]. He was Leader of the Opposition for a short period in 1931, but was ineligible to continue when he lost his seat in the 1931 general election. [[George Lansbury]] was Leader of the Opposition before he also became the Leader of the Labour Party in 1932.\n\n===Statutory Leaders of the Opposition from 1937===\nLeaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament had been generally recognised and given a special status in Parliament for more than a century before they were mentioned in legislation.\n\n''[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice]]'' confirms that the office of Leader of the Opposition was first given statutory recognition in the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1937]].\n\n* Section 5 states that \"There shall be paid to the Leader of the Opposition an annual salary of two thousand pounds\".\n* Section 10(1) includes a definition (which codifies the usual situation under the previous custom)  \"Leader of the Opposition\" means that member of the House of Commons who is for the time being the leader in that House of the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in that House\".\n* The 1937 Act also contains an important provision to decide who is the Leader of the Opposition, if this is in doubt. Under section 10(3) \"If any doubt arises as to which is or was at any material time the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons, or as to who is or was at any material time the leader in that House of such a party the question shall be decided for the purposes of this Act by the Speaker of the House of Commons, and his decision, certified in writing under his hand, shall be final and conclusive\".\n\nSubsequent legislation also gave statutory recognition to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\n* Section 2(1) of the [[Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975]], provides that \"In this Act \"Leader of the Opposition\" means, in relation to either House of Parliament, that member of that House who is for the time being the Leader in that House of the party in opposition to Her Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons\".\n* Section 2(2) is in exactly the same terms as section 10(3) of the 1937 Act (apart from substituting Her Majesty's for His Majesty's).\n* Section 2(3) is a corresponding provision for the [[Lord Chancellor]] (since 2005, the [[Lord Speaker]]) to decide about the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\nThe legislative provisions confirm that Leader of the Opposition is, strictly, a Parliamentary office; so that to be leader a person must be a member of the House in which he or she leads.\n\nSince 1937 the Leader of the Opposition has received a state salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), now equivalent to a Cabinet Minister. The holder also receives a [[chauffeur]]-driven car for official business of equivalent cost and specification to the vehicles used by most [[minister (government)|cabinet ministers]].\n\nIn 1940 the three largest parties in the House of Commons formed a coalition government to continue to prosecute the Second World War. This coalition continued in office until shortly after the defeat of Germany in 1945. As the former Leader of the Opposition had joined the government the issue arose of who was to hold the office or perform its functions. ''Keesing's Contemporary Archives 1937\u20131940'' (at paragraph 4069D) reported the situation, based on ''[[Hansard]]'':\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Prime Minister replying to Mr Denman in the House of Commons on 21 May, said that in view of the formation of an Administration embracing the three main political parties, H.M. Government was of the opinion that the provision of the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, relating to the payment of a salary to the Leader of the Opposition was in abeyance for the time being, as there was no alternative party capable of forming a Government. He added that he did not consider amending legislation necessary.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' reported that the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] met on 22 May 1940 and unanimously elected Dr [[Hastings Bertrand Lees-Smith|H.B. Lees-Smith]] as Chairman of the PLP (an office normally held by the party leader at that time) and as spokesman of the Party from the opposition front bench.\n\nAfter the death of Lees-Smith, on 18 December 1941, the PLP held a meeting on 21 January 1942. [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence]] was unanimously elected Chairman of the PLP and the official spokesman of the party in the House of Commons while the party leader was serving in the government. After the deputy leader of the party ([[Arthur Greenwood]]) left the government on 22 February 1942 he took over these roles from Pethick-Lawrence until the end of the coalition and the resumption of normal party politics.\n\n==List of Leaders of the Opposition==\nThe table lists the people who were, or who acted as, Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament since 1807, prior to which the post was held by [[Charles James Fox]] for decades.\n\nThe leaders of the two Houses were of equal status, before 1911, unless one was the most recent Prime Minister for the party. Such a former prime minister was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. From 1911 the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. Overall leaders names are bolded. Acting leaders names are in italics unless the acting leader subsequently became a full leader during a continuous period as leader.\n\nDue to the fragmentation of both principal parties in 1827\u201330, the leaders and principal opposition parties suggested for those years are provisional.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!colspan=2|Principal party<br />of

This may possibly have also been the case in 1828\u201330. Grey's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' suggests \"... though he called on Lansdowne to take up the leadership of the opposition he was still unwilling to give it up altogether\". Grey was in opposition in 1827\u201328, when Lansdowne was in government. Given the confusion of the politics of the period, particularly after 1827 when both principal parties were fragmented, it is possible that Grey should be considered Leader of the Opposition 1824\u20131830. However the definite statements (by Foord) that Grey resigned the leadership in 1824 and (by Cook & Keith) that Grey did not resume the leadership until November 1830 leads to a different conclusion.\n: {{note label|B|B|B}} An alternative interpretation is that Palmerston (the immediate past Prime Minister) and Lord John Russell (a previous Prime Minister) were joint leaders. Cook & Keith have Palmerston as the sole leader.\n: {{note label|C|C|C}} Harcourt resigned 14 December 1898.\n: {{note label|D|D|D}} Rosebery resigned 6 October 1896.\n: {{note label|E|E|E}} Balfour lost his seat in the House of Commons in January 1906.\n: {{note label|F|F|F}} During Asquith's coalition government of 1915\u20131916, there was no formal opposition in either the Commons or the Lords. The only party not in Asquith's Liberal, Conservative, Labour Coalition was the Irish Nationalist Party led by [[John Redmond]]. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition. [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure amongst the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n: {{note label|G|G|G}} Asquith lost his seat in the House of Commons in December 1918.\n: {{note label|H|H|H}} Douglas in ''The History of the Liberal Party 1895\u20131970'' observes that \"The technical question whether the Leader of the Opposition was Maclean or [[William Adamson]], Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, was never fully resolved ... The fact that Adamson did not press his claim for Opposition leadership is of more than technical interest, for it shows that the Labour Party was still not taking itself seriously as a likely alternative government\".\n: {{note label|I|I|I}} The Labour Party did not appoint a leader in the Lords until it formed its first government in 1924.\n: {{note label|J|J|J}} Henderson lost his seat in the House of Commons on 27 October 1931.\n: {{note label|K|K|K}} Lansbury was acting as leader, in the absence from the House of Commons of Henderson, in 1931\u20131932; before becoming party leader himself in 1932.\n: {{note label|L|L|L}} Attlee was acting as leader, after the resignation of Lansbury on 25 October 1935, before being elected party leader himself on 3 December 1935.\n: {{note label|M|M|M}} During World War II a succession of three Labour politicians acted as Leader of the Opposition for the purpose of allowing the House of Commons to function normally, however as in the mid World War I ministry, opposition did not run under a party-whipped system. As the Government 1940\u201345 was a coalition government in which Labour politicians functioned fully as members of the Government: neither [[Deputy Prime Minister (UK)|Deputy Prime Minister]] Clement Attlee nor these three received the salary for the post of Leader of the Opposition. The largest party that opposed the war and was not part of the coalition \u2013 and therefore, in theory, the opposition was the [[Independent Labour Party]] led by [[James Maxton]]. With only three MPs, it tried to take over the opposition frontbench but was widely opposed in this venture.\n: {{note label|N|N|N}} Lord Addison was not a member of the wartime coalition government. When Labour was part of the government from May 1940 until May 1945, Addison functioned as a formal, procedural Opposition Leader, in the same way as the acting Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons.\n: {{note label|O|O|O}} Viscount Cranborne is the main subsidiary title to the [[Marquess of Salisbury]] given to its heir. Two Lords Cranborne have been Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. They sat in the House of Lords as the title unusually had an acting [[writ of acceleration]] which did entitle father and son to sit in the House, ineffective since the [[House of Lords Act 1999]].\n: {{note label|P|P|P}} Commonly referred to as the acting leader, following the death or immediate resignation of the leader, but is, according to the Labour Party Rule Book, fully leader until the next leader is selected. Before 1981 the leader, in opposition, was elected annually by the parliamentary Labour Party. From 1981 to 2010, the leader was elected by an electoral college of party members, MPs and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], as well as [[trade unions]] before the party switched to a true [[one member, one vote]] system in 2015.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[List of Leaders of the Opposition of the United Kingdom by length of tenure]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''British Historical Facts 1760\u20131830'', by Chris Cook and John Stevenson (The Macmillan Press 1980)\n* ''British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900'', by Chris Cook and Brendan Keith (The Macmillan Press 1975)\n* ''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', by Archibald S.

Labour served in the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition]] of 1940\u20131945, after which [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] established the [[National Health Service]] and expanded the [[welfare state]] from 1945 to 1951.

The first [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib\u2013Lab]] candidate to stand was [[George Odger]] in the [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]] by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the [[Independent Labour Party]], the intellectual and largely middle-class [[Fabian Society]], the Marxist [[Social Democratic Federation]]<ref>Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation</ref> and the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888\u20131893)|Scottish Labour Party]].\n\nAt the [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895 general election]], the Independent Labour Party put up 28 candidates but won only 44,325 votes. [[Keir Hardie]], the leader of the party, believed that to obtain success in parliamentary elections, it would be necessary to join with other left-wing groups. Hardie's roots as a lay preacher contributed to an ethos in the party which led to the comment by 1950s General Secretary [[Morgan Phillips]] that \"Socialism in Britain owed more to Methodism than Marx\".<ref>p.131 The Foundations of the British Labour Party by Matthew Worley {{ISBN|9780754667315}}</ref>\n\n=== Labour Representation Committee (1900\u20131906) ===\n{{main|Labour Representation Committee (1900)}}\n[[File:jameskeirhardie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keir Hardie]], one of the Labour Party's founders and its first leader]]\nIn 1899, a [[Doncaster]] member of the [[Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]], Thomas R.

He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united. The [[1900 United Kingdom general election|October 1900]] \"Khaki election\" came too soon for the new party to campaign effectively; total expenses for the election only came to \u00a333.{{sfn|Wright|Carter|1997}} Only 15 candidatures were sponsored, but two were successful: [[Keir Hardie]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Richard Bell (British politician)|Richard Bell]] in [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]].{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\nSupport for the LRC was boosted by the 1901 [[Taff Vale Case]], a dispute between strikers and a railway company that ended with the union being ordered to pay \u00a323,000 damages for a strike. The judgement effectively made strikes illegal, since employers could recoup the cost of lost business from the unions. The apparent acquiescence of the Conservative Government of [[Arthur Balfour]] to industrial and business interests (traditionally the allies of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in opposition to the Conservatives' landed interests) intensified support for the LRC against a government that appeared to have little concern for the industrial proletariat and its problems.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\n[[File:LabourPartyPlaque.jpg|thumb|left|Labour Party Plaque from Caroone House, 14 Farringdon Street]]\nIn the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 election]], the LRC won 29 seats\u2014helped by a [[Gladstone\u2013MacDonald pact|secret 1903 pact]] between [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Chief Whip]] [[Herbert Gladstone, 1st Viscount Gladstone|Herbert Gladstone]] that aimed to avoid splitting the opposition vote between Labour and Liberal candidates in the interest of removing the Conservatives from office.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\nIn their first meeting after the election the group's Members of Parliament decided to adopt the name \"The Labour Party\" formally (15 February 1906). Keir Hardie, who had taken a leading role in getting the party established, was elected as Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (in effect, the leader), although only by one vote over [[David Shackleton]] after several ballots. In the party's early years the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) provided much of its activist base as the party did not have individual membership until 1918 but operated as a conglomerate of affiliated bodies. The [[Fabian Society]] provided much of the intellectual stimulus for the party. One of the first acts of the new Liberal Government was to reverse the Taff Vale judgement.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\nThe [[People's History Museum]] in [[Manchester]] holds the minutes of the first Labour Party meeting in 1906 and has them on display in the Main Galleries.<ref name=\"People's History Museum\">{{cite web |title=Collection Highlights, 1906 Labour Party minutes |publisher=People's History Museum |url=http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/1906-labour-party-minutes/ |accessdate=23 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820074421/http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/1906-labour-party-minutes/ |archive-date=20 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Also within the museum is the Labour History Archive and Study Centre, which holds the collection of the Labour Party, with material ranging from 1900 to the present day.<ref name=\"phm.org.uk\">{{citation |title=The Labour Party Archive Catalogue & Description |publisher=People's History Museum |url=http://www.phm.org.uk/archive-study-centre/online-catalogue/ |access-date=20 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113161101/http://www.phm.org.uk/archive-study-centre/online-catalogue/ |archive-date=13 January 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Early years (1906\u20131923) ===\nThe [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 election]] saw 42 Labour MPs elected to the House of Commons, a significant victory since, a year before the election, the House of Lords had passed the [[Osborne judgment]] ruling that trade union members would have to 'opt in' to sending contributions to Labour, rather than their consent being presumed. The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this judicial decision with primary legislation. The height of Liberal compromise was to introduce a wage for Members of Parliament to remove the need to involve the trade unions. By 1913, faced with the opposition of the largest trade unions, the Liberal government passed the Trade Disputes Act to allow unions to fund Labour MPs once more without seeking the express consent of their members.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Labour Party split between supporters and opponents of the conflict but opposition to the war grew within the party as time went on. [[Ramsay MacDonald]], a notable anti-war campaigner, resigned as leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party and [[Arthur Henderson]] became the main figure of authority within the party. He was soon accepted into [[H. H. Asquith|Prime Minister Asquith]]'s war cabinet, becoming the first Labour Party member to serve in government.\n\nDespite mainstream Labour Party's support for the coalition the [[Independent Labour Party]] was instrumental in opposing conscription through organisations such as the [[Non-Conscription Fellowship]] while a Labour Party affiliate, the [[British Socialist Party]], organised a number of unofficial strikes.<ref>John Foster,  \"Strike action and working-class politics on Clydeside 1914\u20131919.\" ''International Review of Social History'' 35#1 (1990): 33\u201370.</ref>\n\n[[Arthur Henderson]] resigned from the Cabinet in 1917 amid calls for party unity to be replaced by [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]]. The growth in Labour's local activist base and organisation was reflected in the elections following the war, the [[co-operative]] movement now providing its own resources to the [[Co-operative Party]] after the armistice. The Co-operative Party later reached an electoral agreement with the Labour Party.\n\nAt the end of the First World War, the Government was attempting to provide support for the newly re-established [[Poland]] against [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. Henderson sent telegrams to all local Labour Party organisations to ask them to organise demonstrations against supporting Poland, later forming the Council of Action, to further organise strikes and protests. Due to the number of demonstrations and the potential industrial impact across the country, Churchill and the Government was forced to end support for the Polish war effort.<ref>http://isj.org.uk/the-russian-revolution-and-the-british-working-class/</ref>\n\nHenderson turned his attention to building a strong constituency-based support network for the Labour Party. Previously, it had little national organisation, based largely on branches of unions and socialist societies. Working with Ramsay MacDonald and Sidney Webb, Henderson in 1918 established a national network of constituency organisations. They operated separately from trade unions and the National Executive Committee and were open to everyone sympathetic to the party's policies. Secondly, Henderson secured the adoption of a comprehensive statement of party policies, as drafted by [[Sidney Webb]]. Entitled \"Labour and the New Social Order,\" it remained the basic Labour platform until 1950. It proclaimed a socialist party whose principles included a guaranteed minimum standard of living for everyone, nationalisation of industry, and heavy taxation of large incomes and of wealth.<ref>Bentley B. Gilbert, ''Britain since 1918'' (1980) p 49.</ref> It was in 1918 that [[Clause IV]], as drafted by [[Sidney Webb]], was adopted into Labour's constitution, committing the party to work towards \"the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange.\"\n\nWith the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], almost all adult men (excepting only peers, criminals and lunatics) and most women over the age of thirty were given the right to vote, almost tripling the British electorate at a stroke, from 7.7 million in 1912 to 21.4 million in 1918. This set the scene for a surge in Labour representation in parliament.<ref name=\"Rosemary Rees 2003 p. 200\">Rosemary Rees, ''Britain, 1890\u20131939'' (2003), p. 200</ref>  The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] was refused affiliation to the Labour Party between 1921 and 1923.<ref name=\"Glasgow Digital Library\">{{cite web |url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |title=Red Clydeside: The Communist Party and the Labour government [booklet cover&#93; / Communist Party of Great Britain, 1924 |publisher=Glasgow Digital Library |accessdate=13 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105173202/http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |archive-date=5 November 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] declined rapidly, and the party also suffered a catastrophic split which allowed the Labour Party to gain much of the Liberals' support.<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The downfall of the Liberal Party, 1914\u20131935'' (1966) ch 14</ref>  With the Liberals thus in disarray, Labour won 142 seats in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], making it the second largest political group in the House of Commons and the [[Official Opposition (UK)|official opposition]] to the Conservative government. After the election Ramsay MacDonald was voted the first official [[List of United Kingdom Labour Party leaders|leader of the Labour Party]].\n\n=== First Labour government and period in opposition (1923\u20131929) ===\n{{main|First MacDonald ministry}}\n[[File:Ramsay MacDonald ggbain.29588.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramsay MacDonald]], first Labour Prime Minister (1924 and 1929\u20131931)]]\nThe [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] was fought on the Conservatives' [[protectionist]] proposals but, although they got the most votes and remained the largest party, they lost their majority in parliament, necessitating the formation of a government supporting [[free trade]]. Thus, with the acquiescence of Asquith's Liberals, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became the first ever Labour Prime Minister in January 1924, forming the first Labour government, despite Labour only having 191 MPs (less than a third of the House of Commons).\n\nThe most significant achievement of the first Labour government was the [[Wheatley Housing Act]], which began a building programme of 500,000 [[municipal housing|municipal houses]] for rental to low paid workers. Legislation on education, unemployment, social insurance and tenant protection was also passed. However, because the government had to rely on the support of the Liberals it was unable to implement many of its more contentious policies such as [[nationalisation]] of the coal industry, or a [[capital levy]]. Although no radical changes were introduced, Labour demonstrating that they were capable of governing.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001|pp=51\u201353}}\n\nWhile there were no major labour strikes during his term, MacDonald acted swiftly to end those that did erupt. When the Labour Party executive criticised the government, he replied that, \"public doles, [[Poplar Rates Rebellion|Poplarism]] [local defiance of the national government], strikes for increased wages, limitation of output, not only are not Socialism, but may mislead the spirit and policy of the Socialist movement.\"{{sfn|Taylor|1965|pp=213\u2013214}}\n\nThe government collapsed after only ten months when the Liberals voted for a Select Committee inquiry into the [[Patrick Hastings#Campbell Case|Campbell Case]], a vote which MacDonald had declared to be a vote of confidence. The ensuing [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]] saw the publication, four days before polling day, of the forged [[Zinoviev letter]], in which Moscow talked about a Communist revolution in Britain. The letter had little impact on the Labour vote\u2014which held up. It was the collapse of the Liberal party that led to the Conservative landslide. The Conservatives were returned to power although Labour increased its vote from 30.7% to a third of the popular vote, most Conservative gains being at the expense of the Liberals. However, many Labourites blamed for years their defeat on foul play (the Zinoviev letter), thereby according to [[A. J. P. Taylor]] misunderstanding the political forces at work and delaying needed reforms in the party.{{sfn|Taylor|1965|pp=219\u2013220, 226\u2013227}}<ref name=\"Charles Loch Mowat 1955 188\u201394\">{{cite book|author=Charles Loch Mowat|authorlink=C.

However MacDonald was still reliant on Liberal support to form a minority government. MacDonald went on to appoint Britain's first woman cabinet minister; [[Margaret Bondfield]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]].<ref>John Shepherd, The Second Labour Government: A reappraisal (2012).</ref>\n\nMacDonald's second government was in a stronger parliamentary position than his first, and in 1930 Labour was able to pass legislation to raise unemployment pay, improve wages and conditions in the coal industry (i.e. the issues behind the General Strike) and pass a housing act which focused on slum clearances.<ref>Morgan, Kevin.

By the end of 1930 unemployment had doubled to over two and a half million.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\">Davies, A.J. (1996) ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', Abacus</ref>  The government had no effective answers to the deteriorating financial situation, and by 1931 there was much fear that the budget was unbalanced, which was born out by the independent [[May Report]] which triggered a confidence crisis and a run on the pound. The cabinet deadlocked over its response, with several influential members unwilling to support the budget cuts (in particular a cut in the rate of unemployment benefit) which were pressed by the civil service and opposition parties. [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Philip Snowden]] refused to consider [[deficit spending]] or tariffs as alternative solutions. When a final vote was taken, the Cabinet was split 11\u20139 with a minority, including many political heavyweights such as [[Arthur Henderson]] and [[George Lansbury]], threatening to resign rather than agree to the cuts. The unworkable split, on 24 August 1931, made the government resign. MacDonald was encouraged by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] to form an all-party [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] to deal with the immediate crisis.<ref>Neil Riddell, ''Labour in Crisis: The Second Labour Government 1929\u20131931'' (Manchester UP, 1999).</ref><ref>Chris Wrigley, \"The Fall of the Second MacDonald Government, 1931.\" in T.

The king played the central role in demanding a National government be formed. On 24 August, MacDonald agreed to form a National Government composed of men from all parties with the specific aim of balancing the Budget and restoring confidence. The new cabinet had four Labourites (who formed a  \"[[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]]\" group) who stood with MacDonald, plus four Conservatives (led by Baldwin, Chamberlain) and two Liberals.  MacDonald's moves aroused great anger among a large majority of Labour Party activists who felt betrayed. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and his supporters and made Henderson the leader of the main Labour party. Henderson led it into [[1931 United Kingdom general election|the general election]] on 27 October against the three-party National coalition. It was a disaster for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52 seats. The Conservative-dominated National Government, led by MacDonald won the largest landslide in British political history.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2639239|title = Arthur Henderson and the British Political Crisis of 1931|journal = The Historical Journal|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 117\u2013139|last1 = Thorpe|first1 = Andrew|year = 1988|doi = 10.1017/S0018246X00012012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, Labour campaigned on opposition to public spending cuts, but found it difficult to defend the record of the party's former government and the fact that most of the cuts had been agreed before it fell. Historian Andrew Thorpe argues that Labour lost credibility by 1931 as unemployment soared, especially in coal, textiles, shipbuilding,  and steel. The working class increasingly lost confidence in the ability of Labour to solve the most pressing problem.{{sfn|Thorpe|1996}}\n\nThe 2.5 million Irish Catholics in England and Scotland were a major factor in the Labour base in many industrial areas. The Catholic Church had previously tolerated the Labour Party, and denied that it represented true socialism. However, the bishops by 1930 had grown increasingly alarmed at Labour's policies toward Communist Russia, toward birth control and especially toward funding Catholic schools. They warned its members. The Catholic shift against Labour and in favour of the National government played a major role in Labour's losses.{{sfn|Riddell|1997}}\n\n=== Labour in opposition (1931\u20131940) ===\n[[Arthur Henderson]], elected in 1931 to succeed MacDonald, lost his seat in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The only former Labour cabinet member who had retained his seat, the pacifist [[George Lansbury]], accordingly became party leader.\n\nThe party experienced another split in 1932 when the [[Independent Labour Party]], which for some years had been increasingly at odds with the Labour leadership, opted to disaffiliate from the Labour Party and embarked on a long, drawn-out decline.\n\nLansbury resigned as leader in 1935 after public disagreements over foreign policy. He was promptly replaced as leader by his deputy, [[Clement Attlee]], who would lead the party for two decades. The party experienced a revival in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], winning 154 seats and 38% of the popular vote, the highest that Labour had achieved.<ref>John Bew,  ''Clement Attlee: The Man Who Made Modern Britain'' (2017).</ref>\n\nAs the threat from [[Nazi Germany]] increased, in the late 1930s the Labour Party gradually abandoned its pacifist stance and came to support re-armament, largely due to the efforts of [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[Hugh Dalton]] who by 1937 had also persuaded the party to oppose [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s policy of [[appeasement]].<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\" />\n\n=== Wartime coalition (1940\u20131945) ===\n{{see also|Churchill war ministry}}\nThe party returned to government in 1940 as part of the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition]].

The Labour Party returned to government with a 4-seat majority under Wilson in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] but increased its majority to 96 in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]].\n\nWilson's government was responsible for a number of sweeping social and educational reforms under the leadership of [[Home Secretary]] [[Roy Jenkins]] such as the abolishment of the [[death penalty]] in 1964, the legalisation of [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]] (initially only for men aged 21 or over, and only in [[England and Wales]]) in 1967 and the abolition of theatre censorship in 1968. Wilson's government also put heavy emphasis on expanding opportunities through education, and as such, [[comprehensive education]] was expanded and the [[Open University]] created.\n\nWilson's first period as Prime Minister coincided with a period of relatively low unemployment and economic prosperity, it was however hindered by significant problems with a large trade deficit which it had inherited from the previous government. The first three years of the government were spent in an ultimately doomed attempt to stave off devaluation of the pound. Labour went on to unexpectedly lose the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] to the Conservatives under [[Edward Heath]].\n\n=== Spell in opposition (1970\u20131974) ===\nAfter losing the 1970 general election, Labour returned to opposition, but retained Harold Wilson as Leader. Heath's government soon ran into trouble over [[Northern Ireland]] and a dispute with miners in 1973 which led to the \"[[three-day week]]\". The 1970s proved a difficult time to be in government for both the Conservatives and Labour due to the [[1973 oil crisis]] which caused high inflation and a global recession.\n\nThe Labour Party was returned to power again under Wilson a few weeks after the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], forming a minority government with the support of the [[Ulster Unionist]]s. The Conservatives were unable to form a government alone as they had fewer seats despite receiving more votes numerically. It was the first general election since 1924 in which both main parties had received less than 40% of the popular vote and the first of six successive general elections in which Labour failed to reach 40% of the popular vote. In a bid to gain a majority, a second election was soon called for [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] in which Labour, still with Harold Wilson as leader, won a slim majority of three, gaining just 18 seats taking its total to 319.\n\n=== Majority to minority (1974\u20131979) ===\n{{main|Labour Government 1974\u201379}}\nFor much of its time in office the Labour government struggled with serious economic problems and a precarious majority in the Commons, while the party's internal dissent over Britain's membership of the [[European Economic Community]], which Britain had entered under Edward Heath in 1972, led in 1975 to a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|national referendum]] on the issue in which two thirds of the public supported continued membership.\n\nHarold Wilson's personal popularity remained reasonably high but he unexpectedly resigned as Prime Minister in 1976 citing health reasons, and was replaced by [[James Callaghan]].

Deals were then forged with various small parties including the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and the Welsh nationalist [[Plaid Cymru]], prolonging the life of the government.\n\nThe nationalist parties, in turn, demanded [[devolution]] to their respective constituent countries in return for their supporting the government. When referendums for Scottish and Welsh devolution were held in March 1979 the [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum|Welsh devolution referendum]] saw a large majority vote against, while the [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|Scottish referendum]] returned a narrow majority in favour without reaching the required threshold of 40% support. When the Labour government duly refused to push ahead with setting up the proposed Scottish Assembly, the SNP withdrew its support for the government: this finally brought the government down as the Conservatives triggered a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|vote of confidence]] in Callaghan's government that was lost by a single vote on 28 March 1979, necessitating a general election.\n\nBy 1978, the economy had started to show signs of recovery, with inflation falling to single digits, unemployment falling, and living standards starting to rise during the year.<ref>A Short History of the Labour Party by Henry Pelling</ref> Labour's opinion poll ratings also improved, with most showing the party to be in the lead.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}} Callaghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978 to take advantage of the improving situation. In the event, he decided to gamble that extending the wage restraint policy for another year would allow the economy to be in better shape for a 1979 election. However this proved unpopular with the trade unions, and during the winter of 1978\u201379 there were widespread strikes among lorry drivers, railway workers, car workers and local government and hospital workers in favour of higher pay-rises that caused significant disruption to everyday life. These events came to be dubbed the \"[[Winter of Discontent]]\".\n\nThese industrial disputes sent the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] now led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] into the lead in the polls, which led to Labour's defeat in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]. The Labour vote held up in the election, with the party receiving nearly the same number of votes than in 1974. However, the Conservative Party achieved big increases in support in the Midlands and South of England, benefiting from both a surge in turnout and votes lost by the ailing Liberals.\n\n=== Opposition and internal conflict (1979\u20131994) ===\n{{see also|Shadow Cabinet of Michael Foot|Shadow Cabinet of Neil Kinnock|Shadow Cabinet of John Smith}}\n[[File:Michael Foot (1981).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Michael Foot]], Leader of  the Opposition (1980\u20131983)]]\nAfter its defeat in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] the Labour Party underwent a period of internal rivalry between the left represented by [[Tony Benn]], and the right represented by [[Denis Healey]].

Most opinion polls had shown Labour comfortably ahead of the Tories for more than a year before Thatcher's resignation, with the fall in Tory support blamed largely on her introduction of the unpopular [[Tax per head|poll tax]], combined with the fact that the economy was [[Early 1990s recession|sliding into recession]] at the time. The change of leader in the Tory government saw a turnaround in support for the Tories, who regularly topped the opinion polls throughout 1991 although Labour regained the lead more than once.\n\nThe \"yo-yo\" in the opinion polls continued into 1992, though after November 1990 any Labour lead in the polls was rarely sufficient for a majority. Major resisted Kinnock's calls for a general election throughout 1991. Kinnock campaigned on the theme \"It's Time for a Change\", urging voters to elect a new government after more than a decade of unbroken Conservative rule. However, the Conservatives themselves had undergone a change of leader from Thatcher to Major, and replaced the Community Charge.  From the outset, it was clearly a well-received change, as Labour's 14-point lead in the November 1990 \"Poll of Polls\" was replaced by an 8% Tory lead a month later.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] was widely tipped to result in a hung parliament or a narrow Labour majority, but in the event the Conservatives were returned to power, though with a much reduced majority of 21.<ref name=\"1992: Tories win again against odds\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm 1992: Tories win again against odds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908173422/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm |date=8 September 2017 }} BBC News, 5 April 2005</ref> Despite the increased number of seats and votes, it was still an incredibly disappointing result for supporters of the Labour party. For the first time in over 30 years there was serious doubt among the public and the media as to whether Labour could ever return to government.\n\n[[File:John Smith 1992.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], Leader of the Opposition (1992\u20131994)]]\nKinnock then resigned as leader and was succeeded by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. Once again the battle erupted between the old guard on the party's left and those identified as \"modernisers\".  The old guard argued that trends showed they were regaining strength under Smith's strong leadership.  Meanwhile, the breakaway SDP merged with the Liberal Party. The new [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] seemed to pose a major threat to the Labour base. [[Tony Blair]] (the Shadow Home Secretary) had a different vision to traditional Labour politics. Blair, the leader of the \"modernising\" faction, argued that the long-term trends had to be reversed, arguing that the party was too locked into a base that was shrinking, since it was based on the working-class, on trade unions, and on residents of subsidised council housing. Blair argued that the rapidly growing middle class was largely ignored, as well as more ambitious working-class families. Blair said that they aspired to become middle-class and accepted the Conservative argument that traditional Labour was holding ambitious people back to some extent with higher tax policies. To present a fresh face and new policies to the electorate, [[New Labour]] needed more than fresh leaders; it had to jettison outdated policies, argued the modernisers.<ref>David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh, ''The British general election of 1997'' (1997) pp 46\u201367.</ref> The first step was procedural, but essential.

Although the recession was declared over in April 1993 and a period of strong and sustained economic growth followed, coupled with a relatively swift fall in unemployment, the Labour lead in the opinion polls remained strong.

It only gained a \"socialist\" commitment with the original party constitution of 1918. That \"socialist\" element, the original [[Clause IV]], was seen by its strongest advocates as a straightforward commitment to the \"common ownership\", or [[Nationalization|nationalisation]], of the \"means of production, distribution and exchange\". Although about a third of British industry was taken into public ownership after the Second World War, and remained so until the 1980s, the right of the party were questioning the validity of expanding on this objective by the late 1950s.

The winning entry, emblazoned with the word \"Liberty\" over a design incorporating a torch, shovel and quill symbol, was popularised through its sale, in badge form, for a shilling.

It overtook the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to become the main opposition to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the early 1920s, forming two minority governments under [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in the 1920s and early 1930s. Labour served in the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition]] of 1940\u20131945, after which [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] established the [[National Health Service]] and expanded the [[welfare state]] from 1945 to 1951. Under [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]], Labour again governed from [[Labour government, 1964\u20131970|1964 to 1970]] and [[Labour government, 1974\u20131979|1974 to 1979]]. In the 1990s, [[Tony Blair]] took Labour to the [[Centrism|centre]] as part of his \"[[New Labour]]\" project, which governed the UK under Blair and then [[Gordon Brown]] from 1997 to 2010.\n\nThe Labour Party currently forms the Official Opposition in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], having won the second-largest number of seats in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]] and [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general elections]].

The first [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib\u2013Lab]] candidate to stand was [[George Odger]] in the [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]] by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the [[Independent Labour Party]], the intellectual and largely middle-class [[Fabian Society]], the Marxist [[Social Democratic Federation]]<ref>Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation</ref> and the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888\u20131893)|Scottish Labour Party]].\n\nAt the [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895 general election]], the Independent Labour Party put up 28 candidates but won only 44,325 votes. [[Keir Hardie]], the leader of the party, believed that to obtain success in parliamentary elections, it would be necessary to join with other left-wing groups. Hardie's roots as a lay preacher contributed to an ethos in the party which led to the comment by 1950s General Secretary [[Morgan Phillips]] that \"Socialism in Britain owed more to Methodism than Marx\".<ref>p.131 The Foundations of the British Labour Party by Matthew Worley {{ISBN|9780754667315}}</ref>\n\n=== Labour Representation Committee (1900\u20131906) ===\n{{main|Labour Representation Committee (1900)}}\n[[File:jameskeirhardie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keir Hardie]], one of the Labour Party's founders and its first leader]]\nIn 1899, a [[Doncaster]] member of the [[Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]], Thomas R.

The motion was passed at all stages by the TUC, and the proposed conference was held at the [[Congregational Memorial Hall]] on Farringdon Street, London on 26 and 27 February 1900.

He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united. The [[1900 United Kingdom general election|October 1900]] \"Khaki election\" came too soon for the new party to campaign effectively; total expenses for the election only came to \u00a333.{{sfn|Wright|Carter|1997}} Only 15 candidatures were sponsored, but two were successful: [[Keir Hardie]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Richard Bell (British politician)|Richard Bell]] in [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]].{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\nSupport for the LRC was boosted by the 1901 [[Taff Vale Case]], a dispute between strikers and a railway company that ended with the union being ordered to pay \u00a323,000 damages for a strike. The judgement effectively made strikes illegal, since employers could recoup the cost of lost business from the unions. The apparent acquiescence of the Conservative Government of [[Arthur Balfour]] to industrial and business interests (traditionally the allies of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in opposition to the Conservatives' landed interests) intensified support for the LRC against a government that appeared to have little concern for the industrial proletariat and its problems.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\n[[File:LabourPartyPlaque.jpg|thumb|left|Labour Party Plaque from Caroone House, 14 Farringdon Street]]\nIn the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 election]], the LRC won 29 seats\u2014helped by a [[Gladstone\u2013MacDonald pact|secret 1903 pact]] between [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Chief Whip]] [[Herbert Gladstone, 1st Viscount Gladstone|Herbert Gladstone]] that aimed to avoid splitting the opposition vote between Labour and Liberal candidates in the interest of removing the Conservatives from office.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\nIn their first meeting after the election the group's Members of Parliament decided to adopt the name \"The Labour Party\" formally (15 February 1906). Keir Hardie, who had taken a leading role in getting the party established, was elected as Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (in effect, the leader), although only by one vote over [[David Shackleton]] after several ballots. In the party's early years the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) provided much of its activist base as the party did not have individual membership until 1918 but operated as a conglomerate of affiliated bodies. The [[Fabian Society]] provided much of the intellectual stimulus for the party. One of the first acts of the new Liberal Government was to reverse the Taff Vale judgement.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\nThe [[People's History Museum]] in [[Manchester]] holds the minutes of the first Labour Party meeting in 1906 and has them on display in the Main Galleries.<ref name=\"People's History Museum\">{{cite web |title=Collection Highlights, 1906 Labour Party minutes |publisher=People's History Museum |url=http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/1906-labour-party-minutes/ |accessdate=23 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820074421/http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/1906-labour-party-minutes/ |archive-date=20 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Also within the museum is the Labour History Archive and Study Centre, which holds the collection of the Labour Party, with material ranging from 1900 to the present day.<ref name=\"phm.org.uk\">{{citation |title=The Labour Party Archive Catalogue & Description |publisher=People's History Museum |url=http://www.phm.org.uk/archive-study-centre/online-catalogue/ |access-date=20 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113161101/http://www.phm.org.uk/archive-study-centre/online-catalogue/ |archive-date=13 January 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Early years (1906\u20131923) ===\nThe [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 election]] saw 42 Labour MPs elected to the House of Commons, a significant victory since, a year before the election, the House of Lords had passed the [[Osborne judgment]] ruling that trade union members would have to 'opt in' to sending contributions to Labour, rather than their consent being presumed. The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this judicial decision with primary legislation. The height of Liberal compromise was to introduce a wage for Members of Parliament to remove the need to involve the trade unions. By 1913, faced with the opposition of the largest trade unions, the Liberal government passed the Trade Disputes Act to allow unions to fund Labour MPs once more without seeking the express consent of their members.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Labour Party split between supporters and opponents of the conflict but opposition to the war grew within the party as time went on. [[Ramsay MacDonald]], a notable anti-war campaigner, resigned as leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party and [[Arthur Henderson]] became the main figure of authority within the party. He was soon accepted into [[H. H. Asquith|Prime Minister Asquith]]'s war cabinet, becoming the first Labour Party member to serve in government.\n\nDespite mainstream Labour Party's support for the coalition the [[Independent Labour Party]] was instrumental in opposing conscription through organisations such as the [[Non-Conscription Fellowship]] while a Labour Party affiliate, the [[British Socialist Party]], organised a number of unofficial strikes.<ref>John Foster,  \"Strike action and working-class politics on Clydeside 1914\u20131919.\" ''International Review of Social History'' 35#1 (1990): 33\u201370.</ref>\n\n[[Arthur Henderson]] resigned from the Cabinet in 1917 amid calls for party unity to be replaced by [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]]. The growth in Labour's local activist base and organisation was reflected in the elections following the war, the [[co-operative]] movement now providing its own resources to the [[Co-operative Party]] after the armistice. The Co-operative Party later reached an electoral agreement with the Labour Party.\n\nAt the end of the First World War, the Government was attempting to provide support for the newly re-established [[Poland]] against [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. Henderson sent telegrams to all local Labour Party organisations to ask them to organise demonstrations against supporting Poland, later forming the Council of Action, to further organise strikes and protests. Due to the number of demonstrations and the potential industrial impact across the country, Churchill and the Government was forced to end support for the Polish war effort.<ref>http://isj.org.uk/the-russian-revolution-and-the-british-working-class/</ref>\n\nHenderson turned his attention to building a strong constituency-based support network for the Labour Party. Previously, it had little national organisation, based largely on branches of unions and socialist societies. Working with Ramsay MacDonald and Sidney Webb, Henderson in 1918 established a national network of constituency organisations. They operated separately from trade unions and the National Executive Committee and were open to everyone sympathetic to the party's policies. Secondly, Henderson secured the adoption of a comprehensive statement of party policies, as drafted by [[Sidney Webb]]. Entitled \"Labour and the New Social Order,\" it remained the basic Labour platform until 1950. It proclaimed a socialist party whose principles included a guaranteed minimum standard of living for everyone, nationalisation of industry, and heavy taxation of large incomes and of wealth.<ref>Bentley B. Gilbert, ''Britain since 1918'' (1980) p 49.</ref> It was in 1918 that [[Clause IV]], as drafted by [[Sidney Webb]], was adopted into Labour's constitution, committing the party to work towards \"the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange.\"\n\nWith the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], almost all adult men (excepting only peers, criminals and lunatics) and most women over the age of thirty were given the right to vote, almost tripling the British electorate at a stroke, from 7.7 million in 1912 to 21.4 million in 1918. This set the scene for a surge in Labour representation in parliament.<ref name=\"Rosemary Rees 2003 p. 200\">Rosemary Rees, ''Britain, 1890\u20131939'' (2003), p. 200</ref>  The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] was refused affiliation to the Labour Party between 1921 and 1923.<ref name=\"Glasgow Digital Library\">{{cite web |url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |title=Red Clydeside: The Communist Party and the Labour government [booklet cover&#93; / Communist Party of Great Britain, 1924 |publisher=Glasgow Digital Library |accessdate=13 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105173202/http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |archive-date=5 November 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] declined rapidly, and the party also suffered a catastrophic split which allowed the Labour Party to gain much of the Liberals' support.<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The downfall of the Liberal Party, 1914\u20131935'' (1966) ch 14</ref>  With the Liberals thus in disarray, Labour won 142 seats in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], making it the second largest political group in the House of Commons and the [[Official Opposition (UK)|official opposition]] to the Conservative government. After the election Ramsay MacDonald was voted the first official [[List of United Kingdom Labour Party leaders|leader of the Labour Party]].\n\n=== First Labour government and period in opposition (1923\u20131929) ===\n{{main|First MacDonald ministry}}\n[[File:Ramsay MacDonald ggbain.29588.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramsay MacDonald]], first Labour Prime Minister (1924 and 1929\u20131931)]]\nThe [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] was fought on the Conservatives' [[protectionist]] proposals but, although they got the most votes and remained the largest party, they lost their majority in parliament, necessitating the formation of a government supporting [[free trade]]. Thus, with the acquiescence of Asquith's Liberals, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became the first ever Labour Prime Minister in January 1924, forming the first Labour government, despite Labour only having 191 MPs (less than a third of the House of Commons).\n\nThe most significant achievement of the first Labour government was the [[Wheatley Housing Act]], which began a building programme of 500,000 [[municipal housing|municipal houses]] for rental to low paid workers. Legislation on education, unemployment, social insurance and tenant protection was also passed. However, because the government had to rely on the support of the Liberals it was unable to implement many of its more contentious policies such as [[nationalisation]] of the coal industry, or a [[capital levy]]. Although no radical changes were introduced, Labour demonstrating that they were capable of governing.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001|pp=51\u201353}}\n\nWhile there were no major labour strikes during his term, MacDonald acted swiftly to end those that did erupt. When the Labour Party executive criticised the government, he replied that, \"public doles, [[Poplar Rates Rebellion|Poplarism]] [local defiance of the national government], strikes for increased wages, limitation of output, not only are not Socialism, but may mislead the spirit and policy of the Socialist movement.\"{{sfn|Taylor|1965|pp=213\u2013214}}\n\nThe government collapsed after only ten months when the Liberals voted for a Select Committee inquiry into the [[Patrick Hastings#Campbell Case|Campbell Case]], a vote which MacDonald had declared to be a vote of confidence. The ensuing [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]] saw the publication, four days before polling day, of the forged [[Zinoviev letter]], in which Moscow talked about a Communist revolution in Britain. The letter had little impact on the Labour vote\u2014which held up. It was the collapse of the Liberal party that led to the Conservative landslide. The Conservatives were returned to power although Labour increased its vote from 30.7% to a third of the popular vote, most Conservative gains being at the expense of the Liberals. However, many Labourites blamed for years their defeat on foul play (the Zinoviev letter), thereby according to [[A. J. P.

However MacDonald was still reliant on Liberal support to form a minority government. MacDonald went on to appoint Britain's first woman cabinet minister; [[Margaret Bondfield]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]].<ref>John Shepherd, The Second Labour Government: A reappraisal (2012).</ref>\n\nMacDonald's second government was in a stronger parliamentary position than his first, and in 1930 Labour was able to pass legislation to raise unemployment pay, improve wages and conditions in the coal industry (i.e. the issues behind the General Strike) and pass a housing act which focused on slum clearances.<ref>Morgan, Kevin. (2006) MacDonald (20 British Prime Ministers of the 20th Century), Haus Publishing, {{ISBN|1-904950-61-2}}</ref>\n\nThe government, however, soon found itself engulfed in crisis: the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and eventual [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] occurred soon after the government came to power, and the slump in global trade hit Britain hard. By the end of 1930 unemployment had doubled to over two and a half million.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\">Davies, A.J. (1996) ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', Abacus</ref>  The government had no effective answers to the deteriorating financial situation, and by 1931 there was much fear that the budget was unbalanced, which was born out by the independent [[May Report]] which triggered a confidence crisis and a run on the pound. The cabinet deadlocked over its response, with several influential members unwilling to support the budget cuts (in particular a cut in the rate of unemployment benefit) which were pressed by the civil service and opposition parties. [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Philip Snowden]] refused to consider [[deficit spending]] or tariffs as alternative solutions. When a final vote was taken, the Cabinet was split 11\u20139 with a minority, including many political heavyweights such as [[Arthur Henderson]] and [[George Lansbury]], threatening to resign rather than agree to the cuts. The unworkable split, on 24 August 1931, made the government resign. MacDonald was encouraged by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] to form an all-party [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] to deal with the immediate crisis.<ref>Neil Riddell, ''Labour in Crisis: The Second Labour Government 1929\u20131931'' (Manchester UP, 1999).</ref><ref>Chris Wrigley, \"The Fall of the Second MacDonald Government, 1931.\" in T.

The king played the central role in demanding a National government be formed. On 24 August, MacDonald agreed to form a National Government composed of men from all parties with the specific aim of balancing the Budget and restoring confidence. The new cabinet had four Labourites (who formed a  \"[[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]]\" group) who stood with MacDonald, plus four Conservatives (led by Baldwin, Chamberlain) and two Liberals.  MacDonald's moves aroused great anger among a large majority of Labour Party activists who felt betrayed. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and his supporters and made Henderson the leader of the main Labour party. Henderson led it into [[1931 United Kingdom general election|the general election]] on 27 October against the three-party National coalition. It was a disaster for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52 seats. The Conservative-dominated National Government, led by MacDonald won the largest landslide in British political history.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2639239|title = Arthur Henderson and the British Political Crisis of 1931|journal = The Historical Journal|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 117\u2013139|last1 = Thorpe|first1 = Andrew|year = 1988|doi = 10.1017/S0018246X00012012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, Labour campaigned on opposition to public spending cuts, but found it difficult to defend the record of the party's former government and the fact that most of the cuts had been agreed before it fell. Historian Andrew Thorpe argues that Labour lost credibility by 1931 as unemployment soared, especially in coal, textiles, shipbuilding,  and steel. The working class increasingly lost confidence in the ability of Labour to solve the most pressing problem.{{sfn|Thorpe|1996}}\n\nThe 2.5 million Irish Catholics in England and Scotland were a major factor in the Labour base in many industrial areas. The Catholic Church had previously tolerated the Labour Party, and denied that it represented true socialism. However, the bishops by 1930 had grown increasingly alarmed at Labour's policies toward Communist Russia, toward birth control and especially toward funding Catholic schools. They warned its members. The Catholic shift against Labour and in favour of the National government played a major role in Labour's losses.{{sfn|Riddell|1997}}\n\n=== Labour in opposition (1931\u20131940) ===\n[[Arthur Henderson]], elected in 1931 to succeed MacDonald, lost his seat in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The only former Labour cabinet member who had retained his seat, the pacifist [[George Lansbury]], accordingly became party leader.\n\nThe party experienced another split in 1932 when the [[Independent Labour Party]], which for some years had been increasingly at odds with the Labour leadership, opted to disaffiliate from the Labour Party and embarked on a long, drawn-out decline.\n\nLansbury resigned as leader in 1935 after public disagreements over foreign policy. He was promptly replaced as leader by his deputy, [[Clement Attlee]], who would lead the party for two decades. The party experienced a revival in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], winning 154 seats and 38% of the popular vote, the highest that Labour had achieved.<ref>John Bew,  ''Clement Attlee: The Man Who Made Modern Britain'' (2017).</ref>\n\nAs the threat from [[Nazi Germany]] increased, in the late 1930s the Labour Party gradually abandoned its pacifist stance and came to support re-armament, largely due to the efforts of [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[Hugh Dalton]] who by 1937 had also persuaded the party to oppose [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s policy of [[appeasement]].<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\" />\n\n=== Wartime coalition (1940\u20131945) ===\n{{see also|Churchill war ministry}}\nThe party returned to government in 1940 as part of the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition]].

The Labour Party returned to government with a 4-seat majority under Wilson in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] but increased its majority to 96 in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]].\n\nWilson's government was responsible for a number of sweeping social and educational reforms under the leadership of [[Home Secretary]] [[Roy Jenkins]] such as the abolishment of the [[death penalty]] in 1964, the legalisation of [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]] (initially only for men aged 21 or over, and only in [[England and Wales]]) in 1967 and the abolition of theatre censorship in 1968. Wilson's government also put heavy emphasis on expanding opportunities through education, and as such, [[comprehensive education]] was expanded and the [[Open University]] created.\n\nWilson's first period as Prime Minister coincided with a period of relatively low unemployment and economic prosperity, it was however hindered by significant problems with a large trade deficit which it had inherited from the previous government. The first three years of the government were spent in an ultimately doomed attempt to stave off devaluation of the pound. Labour went on to unexpectedly lose the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] to the Conservatives under [[Edward Heath]].\n\n=== Spell in opposition (1970\u20131974) ===\nAfter losing the 1970 general election, Labour returned to opposition, but retained Harold Wilson as Leader. Heath's government soon ran into trouble over [[Northern Ireland]] and a dispute with miners in 1973 which led to the \"[[three-day week]]\". The 1970s proved a difficult time to be in government for both the Conservatives and Labour due to the [[1973 oil crisis]] which caused high inflation and a global recession.\n\nThe Labour Party was returned to power again under Wilson a few weeks after the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], forming a minority government with the support of the [[Ulster Unionist]]s. The Conservatives were unable to form a government alone as they had fewer seats despite receiving more votes numerically. It was the first general election since 1924 in which both main parties had received less than 40% of the popular vote and the first of six successive general elections in which Labour failed to reach 40% of the popular vote. In a bid to gain a majority, a second election was soon called for [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] in which Labour, still with Harold Wilson as leader, won a slim majority of three, gaining just 18 seats taking its total to 319.\n\n=== Majority to minority (1974\u20131979) ===\n{{main|Labour Government 1974\u201379}}\nFor much of its time in office the Labour government struggled with serious economic problems and a precarious majority in the Commons, while the party's internal dissent over Britain's membership of the [[European Economic Community]], which Britain had entered under Edward Heath in 1972, led in 1975 to a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|national referendum]] on the issue in which two thirds of the public supported continued membership.\n\nHarold Wilson's personal popularity remained reasonably high but he unexpectedly resigned as Prime Minister in 1976 citing health reasons, and was replaced by [[James Callaghan]].

Deals were then forged with various small parties including the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and the Welsh nationalist [[Plaid Cymru]], prolonging the life of the government.\n\nThe nationalist parties, in turn, demanded [[devolution]] to their respective constituent countries in return for their supporting the government. When referendums for Scottish and Welsh devolution were held in March 1979 the [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum|Welsh devolution referendum]] saw a large majority vote against, while the [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|Scottish referendum]] returned a narrow majority in favour without reaching the required threshold of 40% support. When the Labour government duly refused to push ahead with setting up the proposed Scottish Assembly, the SNP withdrew its support for the government: this finally brought the government down as the Conservatives triggered a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|vote of confidence]] in Callaghan's government that was lost by a single vote on 28 March 1979, necessitating a general election.\n\nBy 1978, the economy had started to show signs of recovery, with inflation falling to single digits, unemployment falling, and living standards starting to rise during the year.<ref>A Short History of the Labour Party by Henry Pelling</ref> Labour's opinion poll ratings also improved, with most showing the party to be in the lead.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}} Callaghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978 to take advantage of the improving situation. In the event, he decided to gamble that extending the wage restraint policy for another year would allow the economy to be in better shape for a 1979 election. However this proved unpopular with the trade unions, and during the winter of 1978\u201379 there were widespread strikes among lorry drivers, railway workers, car workers and local government and hospital workers in favour of higher pay-rises that caused significant disruption to everyday life. These events came to be dubbed the \"[[Winter of Discontent]]\".\n\nThese industrial disputes sent the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] now led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] into the lead in the polls, which led to Labour's defeat in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]].

Most opinion polls had shown Labour comfortably ahead of the Tories for more than a year before Thatcher's resignation, with the fall in Tory support blamed largely on her introduction of the unpopular [[Tax per head|poll tax]], combined with the fact that the economy was [[Early 1990s recession|sliding into recession]] at the time. The change of leader in the Tory government saw a turnaround in support for the Tories, who regularly topped the opinion polls throughout 1991 although Labour regained the lead more than once.\n\nThe \"yo-yo\" in the opinion polls continued into 1992, though after November 1990 any Labour lead in the polls was rarely sufficient for a majority. Major resisted Kinnock's calls for a general election throughout 1991. Kinnock campaigned on the theme \"It's Time for a Change\", urging voters to elect a new government after more than a decade of unbroken Conservative rule. However, the Conservatives themselves had undergone a change of leader from Thatcher to Major, and replaced the Community Charge.  From the outset, it was clearly a well-received change, as Labour's 14-point lead in the November 1990 \"Poll of Polls\" was replaced by an 8% Tory lead a month later.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] was widely tipped to result in a hung parliament or a narrow Labour majority, but in the event the Conservatives were returned to power, though with a much reduced majority of 21.<ref name=\"1992: Tories win again against odds\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm 1992: Tories win again against odds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908173422/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm |date=8 September 2017 }} BBC News, 5 April 2005</ref> Despite the increased number of seats and votes, it was still an incredibly disappointing result for supporters of the Labour party. For the first time in over 30 years there was serious doubt among the public and the media as to whether Labour could ever return to government.\n\n[[File:John Smith 1992.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], Leader of the Opposition (1992\u20131994)]]\nKinnock then resigned as leader and was succeeded by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. Once again the battle erupted between the old guard on the party's left and those identified as \"modernisers\".  The old guard argued that trends showed they were regaining strength under Smith's strong leadership.  Meanwhile, the breakaway SDP merged with the Liberal Party. The new [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] seemed to pose a major threat to the Labour base. [[Tony Blair]] (the Shadow Home Secretary) had a different vision to traditional Labour politics. Blair, the leader of the \"modernising\" faction, argued that the long-term trends had to be reversed, arguing that the party was too locked into a base that was shrinking, since it was based on the working-class, on trade unions, and on residents of subsidised council housing. Blair argued that the rapidly growing middle class was largely ignored, as well as more ambitious working-class families. Blair said that they aspired to become middle-class and accepted the Conservative argument that traditional Labour was holding ambitious people back to some extent with higher tax policies. To present a fresh face and new policies to the electorate, [[New Labour]] needed more than fresh leaders; it had to jettison outdated policies, argued the modernisers.<ref>David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh, ''The British general election of 1997'' (1997) pp 46\u201367.</ref> The first step was procedural, but essential.

It only gained a \"socialist\" commitment with the original party constitution of 1918. That \"socialist\" element, the original [[Clause IV]], was seen by its strongest advocates as a straightforward commitment to the \"common ownership\", or [[Nationalization|nationalisation]], of the \"means of production, distribution and exchange\". Although about a third of British industry was taken into public ownership after the Second World War, and remained so until the 1980s, the right of the party were questioning the validity of expanding on this objective by the late 1950s.

The winning entry, emblazoned with the word \"Liberty\" over a design incorporating a torch, shovel and quill symbol, was popularised through its sale, in badge form, for a shilling.

He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.
