Located at Spain's Calar Alto Observatory, the instrument allowed the researchers to look for small changes in the star's velocity. After three years of close observation, watching for any wobbles produced by potential orbiting objects, more than 200 measurements indicate the existence of two new planets, known as Teegarden b and [[Teegarden c]].<ref name=\"sciencealert\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/two-earth-like-planets-found-orbiting-a-star-just-12-light-years-away |title=We Just Found 2 of The Most Earth-Like Exoplanets Yet, Only 12.5 Light Years Away |last=Cassella |first=Carly |date=June 19, 2019 |website=Science Alert }}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nTeegarden b is the innermost known planet orbiting Teegarden's Star, with an orbital period of just 4.91 days.

It has a 60 percent chance of having a habitable surface temperature, between 0\u00b0 and 50\u00b0C, though probably closer to 28\u00b0C.<ref name=\"sciencealert\" /> \n\nAnother factor for Teegarden b's potential habitability is its host star. Most red dwarfs emit powerful flares, which can strip the atmospheres off their planets and cause them to be uninhabitable. A good example is [[Kepler-438b]], which has an ESI score of 0.88, but because of its active star it is likely uninhabitable, and another example is [[Proxima Centauri]], the closest star to us. However, Teegarden's Star is relatively inactive and quiet, increasing the chance that Teegarden b may be habitable. Other quiet red dwarfs with potentially habitable exoplanets are [[Ross 128]] and [[Luyten's Star]].\n\n== Host star ==\nTeegarden\u2019s star is a low-mass red dwarf, with a mass of around 9 percent the mass of the Sun's, and with a temperature of around 2,900 Kelvin (2,623\u00b0C or 4,760 F). The very low temperature and luminosity of Teegarden's Star explains why it was not discovered earlier, since it has an apparent magnitude of only 15.1 (and an absolute magnitude of 17.22). Like most red and brown dwarfs it emits most of its energy in the infrared spectrum. It is also older than the [[Sun]], with age of 8 billion years.\n\nIt was discovered in 2003. Astronomers had long thought it was likely that many undiscovered dwarf stars existed within 20 light-years of Earth, because stellar-population surveys show the count of known nearby dwarf stars to be lower than otherwise expected, and these stars are dim and easily overlooked. Teegarden's team thought that these dim stars might be found by data mining some of the huge optical sky survey data sets taken by various programs for other purposes in previous years. So they reexamined the NEAT asteroid tracking data set and found this star. The star was then located on photographic plates from the Palomar Sky Survey taken in 1951. This discovery is significant as the team did not have direct access to any telescopes and did not include professional astronomers at the time of the discovery.\n\nThe parallax was initially measured as 0.43 \u00b1 0.13 arcseconds. This would have placed its distance at only 7.50 light-years, making [[Teegarden's Star]] only the third star system in order of distance from the Sun, ranking between [[Barnard's Star]] and [[Wolf 359]]. However, even at that time the anomalously low luminosity (the absolute magnitude would have been 18.5) and high uncertainty in the parallax suggested that it was in fact somewhat farther away, still one of the [[Sun]]'s nearest neighbors but not nearly as high in the ranking in order of distance. A more accurate parallax measurement of 0.2593 arcseconds was made by George Gatewood in 2009, yielding the now accepted distance of 12.578 light-years.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/07/aa35460-19/aa35460-19.html The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs: Two temperate Earth-mass planet candidates around Teegarden\u2019s Star]\n\n[[Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2019]]\n[[Category:Aries (constellation)]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2020}}\n{{short description|Exoplanet}}\n{{Infobox planet\n| name                     = Teegarden b\n| website                  = Teegardenb.com\n| https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/art_red_dwarf_planets.jpg                = \n<!-- IMAGE               -->\n| image = [[File:Teegarden&#039;s star proper motion.gif|300 px]]\n| caption = Teegarden's Star proper motion\n<!-- DISCOVERY           -->\n| discoverer               = \n| discovery_site           = [[Calar Alto Observatory]]\n| discovered               = June 2019\n| discovery_method         = [[Doppler spectroscopy]]\n<!-- DESIGNATIONS        -->\n<!-- ORBITAL             --> \n| apsis                    = \n| semimajor                = {{val|0.0252|0.0008|0.0009}} [[astronomical unit|AU]]\n| eccentricity             = {{val|0|+0.16|0}}\n| period                   = {{val|4.91|0.0014}} days\n<!-- PHYS CHARS          --> \n| mean_radius  \n| single_temperature       = {{convert|301|K|C}}\n<!-- ATMOSPHERE          --> \n<!-- NOTES               --> \n}}\n'''Teegarden b''' is an [[exoplanet]] found orbiting within the habitable zone of [[Teegarden's star]], an M-type [[red dwarf]] star around 12 light years away from the [[Solar system|Solar System]].
