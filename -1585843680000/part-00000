[[Dallas Austin]], who tried to write the track from a \"female perspective\", wrote and produced it. It is based on member [[Tionne Watkins|Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins]]'s experience with [[infidelity]]. The lyrics portray the singers as women who cheat on their unfaithful lovers for attention. This context was controversial within the group, and strongly opposed by member [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes]], who threatened to wear black tape over her mouth on its accompanying [[music video]].\n\n[[LaFace Records|LaFace]] and [[Arista Records]] released the song as the album's lead single on October 31, 1994, and it gained both critical acclaim and commercial success. Music critics praised Austin's work and TLC's new musical direction, and commercially \"Creep\" became the group's first number one on the United States ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]]. It topped the chart for four consecutive weeks and was later certificated [[RIAA certification#List of certifications|platinum]] in sales. Following its European debut/re-issue in early 1996, the song reached the top ten in the United Kingdom and New Zealand and the top forty in other countries. Included in the remixes was a new [[Rapping|rap]] verse written by Lopes which warns listeners of [[safe sex]] issues. \"Creep\" appeared on many best-of lists and received a [[38th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]].\n\nThe trio contacted [[Matthew Rolston]] to film a music video after seeing his work for [[Salt-N-Pepa]]. The resulting video was later deemed one of the most iconic [[Pop music|pop]] videos of all time, notably for the famous [[silk]] [[pajamas]] costumes and the [[choreography]]. With changes in both musical style and image, the song marked a major reinvention in TLC's career and was hailed as a \"masterpiece\".

[[Dallas Austin]], who tried to write the track from a \"female perspective\", wrote and produced it. It is based on member [[Tionne Watkins|Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins]]'s experience with [[infidelity]]. The lyrics portray the singers as women who cheat on their unfaithful lovers for attention. This context was controversial within the group, and strongly opposed by member [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes]], who threatened to wear black tape over her mouth on its accompanying [[music video]].\n\n[[LaFace Records|LaFace]] and [[Arista Records]] released the song as the album's lead single on October 31, 1994, and it gained both critical acclaim and commercial success. Music critics praised Austin's work and TLC's new musical direction, and commercially \"Creep\" became the group's first number one on the United States ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]]. It topped the chart for four consecutive weeks and was later certificated [[RIAA certification#List of certifications|platinum]] in sales. Following its European debut/re-issue in early 1996, the song reached the top ten in the United Kingdom and New Zealand and the top forty in other countries. Included in the remixes was a new [[Rapping|rap]] verse written by Lopes which warns listeners of [[safe sex]] issues. \"Creep\" appeared on many best-of lists and received a [[38th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]].\n\nThe trio contacted [[Matthew Rolston]] to film a music video after seeing his work for [[Salt-N-Pepa]]. The resulting video was later deemed one of the most iconic [[Pop music|pop]] videos of all time, notably for the famous [[silk]] [[pajamas]] costumes and the [[choreography]]. With changes in both musical style and image, the song marked a major reinvention in TLC's career and was hailed as a \"masterpiece\". They performed it during several live concerts and television events, and the track being used in films and TV series, and [[Cover version|covered]] and [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] by artists including American rock band [[The Afghan Whigs]] and singer [[Zendaya]].\n\n==Development and lyrical content==\n[[File:Tionne Watkins 2016.jpg|right|140px|thumb|\"Creep\" is based on member [[Tionne Watkins|Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins]]' experience with a former boyfriend.]]\nAfter releasing their successful debut album ''[[Ooooooohhh...

These communities would assume limited competences during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further competences, upon negotiation with the central government.

While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an \"equalization\" of all communities, differences still remain.\n\n===The Statute of Autonomy===\n{{Main|Statute of Autonomy}}\n\nThe Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the [[Cortes Generales]], the Spanish Parliament, through an \"Organic Law\", requiring the favourable vote of the absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]].\n\nFor communities that acceded to autonomy through the \"fast route\", a [[referendum]] is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the competences they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable.\n\nThe constitution establishes that all competences not explicitly assumed by the state\u2014the central government\u2014in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all competences not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the state.<ref name=\"article143\" /> In case of conflict, the constitution prevails.<ref name=article143/> In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].\n\n===Institutional organization===\nAll autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:\n* A Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[proportional representation]], in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented\n* A Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a prime minister, whose official title is \"president\",{{efn|name=lehendakari|In the Basque Country, the head of government is officially known as ''[[lehendakari]]'' in Basque, or by the Spanish rendering of the title, ''lendakari''.}}{{efn-lr|\"Autonomic president\", \"regional president\", or simply \"president\" (in Spanish: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente regional'', or simply ''presidente''; in Catalan/Valencian: ''president auton\u00f2mic'', ''president regional'', or simply ''president''; in Galician: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente rexional'', or simply ''presidente'').

Despite minor differences, all communities use [[proportional representation]] following [[D'Hondt method]]; all members of regional parliaments are elected for four-year terms, but the president of the community has the faculty to dissolve the legislature and call for early elections. Nonetheless in all communities except for the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia elections are held the last Sunday of May every four years, concurrent with municipal elections in all Spain.<ref name=carreras>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Descentralizaci%C3%B3n_en_Perspectiva_Compar.html?id=zkclm60b_yoC|first=Francesc|last=de Carreras Serra|title=El Estado de las Autonom\u00edas en Espa\u00f1a|work=Descentralizaci\u00f3n en Perspectiva Comparada: Espa\u00f1a, Colombia y Brasil|publisher=Plural Editores|year=2005|accessdate=12 October 2012|isbn=978-9990563573}}</ref>\n\nThe names of the Council of Government and the Legislative Assembly vary between communities. In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish Crown\u2014like the Generalitat of Catalonia\u2014while others are entirely new creations.\n\nIn some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. A specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, ''junta'' may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three \"historical nationalities\", have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance with their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Valencian Community]].\n\n{{Anchor|Autonomous cities}}The two autonomous cities have more limited competences than autonomous communities, but more than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, who is also the mayor of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councillors.\n\n===Legal powers===\nThe autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize powers (competences) devolved to the 17 autonomous communities, within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it. This has led to an \"asymmetrical homogeneity\".<ref name=perez/> In the words of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] in its ruling of August 5, 1983, the autonomous communities are characterized by their \"homogeneity and diversity...equal in their subordination to the constitutional order, in the principles of their representation in the Senate, in their legitimation before the Constitutional Court, and in that the differences between the distinct Statutes [of Autonomy] cannot imply economic or social privileges; however, they can be unequal with respect to the process to accede to autonomy and the concrete determination of the autonomic content of their Statute, and therefore, in their scope of competences. The autonomic regime is characterized by an equilibrium between homogeneity and diversity ... Without the former there will be no unity or integration in the state's ensemble; without the latter, there would not be [a] true plurality and the capacity of self-government\".<ref name=sinopsis137>{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=137&tipo=2|title=Sin\u00f3psis art\u00edculo 137|first=Julio|last=Castelao|work=Constituci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola (con sin\u00f3psis)| publisher=[[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of the Deputies]]|date=June 2005|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ertzaintza Volkswagen Bilbao.jpg|thumb|An [[Ertzaintza]] police car in the Basque Country]]\nThe asymmetrical devolution is a unique characteristic of the territorial structure of Spain, in that the autonomous communities have a different range of devolved competences.

These communities would assume limited competences during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further competences, upon negotiation with the central government.

They could have established a parliamentary system like the \"historical nationalities\", or they could have not assumed any legislative powers and simply established mechanisms for the administration of the competences they were granted.<ref name=perez/><ref name=clavero/>\n\nOnce the autonomous communities were created, Article 145 prohibits the \"federation of autonomous communities\".

While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an \"equalization\" of all communities, differences still remain.\n\n===The Statute of Autonomy===\n{{Main|Statute of Autonomy}}\n\nThe Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the [[Cortes Generales]], the Spanish Parliament, through an \"Organic Law\", requiring the favourable vote of the absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]].\n\nFor communities that acceded to autonomy through the \"fast route\", a [[referendum]] is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the competences they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable.\n\nThe constitution establishes that all competences not explicitly assumed by the state\u2014the central government\u2014in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all competences not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the state.<ref name=\"article143\" /> In case of conflict, the constitution prevails.<ref name=article143/> In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].\n\n===Institutional organization===\nAll autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:\n* A Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[proportional representation]], in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented\n* A Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a prime minister, whose official title is \"president\",{{efn|name=lehendakari|In the Basque Country, the head of government is officially known as ''[[lehendakari]]'' in Basque, or by the Spanish rendering of the title, ''lendakari''.}}{{efn-lr|\"Autonomic president\", \"regional president\", or simply \"president\" (in Spanish: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente regional'', or simply ''presidente''; in Catalan/Valencian: ''president auton\u00f2mic'', ''president regional'', or simply ''president''; in Galician: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente rexional'', or simply ''presidente'').

Despite minor differences, all communities use [[proportional representation]] following [[D'Hondt method]]; all members of regional parliaments are elected for four-year terms, but the president of the community has the faculty to dissolve the legislature and call for early elections. Nonetheless in all communities except for the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia elections are held the last Sunday of May every four years, concurrent with municipal elections in all Spain.<ref name=carreras>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Descentralizaci%C3%B3n_en_Perspectiva_Compar.html?id=zkclm60b_yoC|first=Francesc|last=de Carreras Serra|title=El Estado de las Autonom\u00edas en Espa\u00f1a|work=Descentralizaci\u00f3n en Perspectiva Comparada: Espa\u00f1a, Colombia y Brasil|publisher=Plural Editores|year=2005|accessdate=12 October 2012|isbn=978-9990563573}}</ref>\n\nThe names of the Council of Government and the Legislative Assembly vary between communities. In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish Crown\u2014like the Generalitat of Catalonia\u2014while others are entirely new creations.\n\nIn some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. A specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, ''junta'' may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three \"historical nationalities\", have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance with their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Valencian Community]].\n\n{{Anchor|Autonomous cities}}The two autonomous cities have more limited competences than autonomous communities, but more than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, who is also the mayor of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councillors.\n\n===Legal powers===\nThe autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize powers (competences) devolved to the 17 autonomous communities, within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it. This has led to an \"asymmetrical homogeneity\".<ref name=perez/> In the words of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] in its ruling of August 5, 1983, the autonomous communities are characterized by their \"homogeneity and diversity...equal in their subordination to the constitutional order, in the principles of their representation in the Senate, in their legitimation before the Constitutional Court, and in that the differences between the distinct Statutes [of Autonomy] cannot imply economic or social privileges; however, they can be unequal with respect to the process to accede to autonomy and the concrete determination of the autonomic content of their Statute, and therefore, in their scope of competences.

''Methods and Data Analysis for Cross-Cultural Research.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1997</ref> Although some critics have pointed to methodological flaws in cross-cultural psychological research and claim that serious shortcomings in the theoretical and methodological bases used impede rather than help the scientific search for universal principles in psychology, cross-cultural psychologists are turning more to the study of how differences (variance) occur, rather than searching for universals in the style of physics or chemistry.<ref name=\"Gielen2004\" /><ref name=\"Smith2013\" />\n\nWhile cross-cultural psychology represented only a minor area of psychology prior to WWII, it began to grow in importance during the 1960s. In 1971, the interdisciplinary Society for Cross-Cultural Research (SCCR) was founded, and in 1972 the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP) was established.<ref name=\"Cherry\">{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=What is Cross Cultural Psychology|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/branchesofpsycholog1/f/cross-cultural.htm|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> Since then, this branch of psychology has continued to expand as there has been an increasing popularity of incorporating culture and diversity into studies of numerous psychological phenomena.\n\nCross-cultural psychology is differentiated from [[cultural psychology]], which refers to the branch of psychology that holds that human behavior is strongly influenced by cultural differences, meaning that psychological phenomena can only be compared with each other across cultures to a limited extent. In contrast, cross-cultural psychology includes a search for possible universals in behavior and mental processes. Cross-cultural psychology \"can be thought of as a type [of] [[research methodology]], rather than an entirely separate field within psychology\".<ref name=\"Cherry\"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lonner | first1 = W.

Nevertheless, cross-cultural psychology, cultural psychology, and international psychology are united by a common concern for expanding psychology into a universal discipline capable of understanding psychological phenomena across cultures and in a global context.\n\n==Definitions and early work==\nTwo definitions of the field include: \"the scientific study of human behavior and its transmission, taking into account the ways in which behaviors are shaped and influenced by social and cultural forces\"<ref name=\"Berry, J. W. 2011\">Berry, J. W., & Poortinga, Y. H. (2011). ''Cross-cultural psychology: Research and applications'' (3rd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> and \"the empirical study of members of various cultural groups who have had different experiences that lead to predictable and significant differences in behavior\".<ref>Brislin, Lonner, & Thorndike, 1973 as cited in Berry, J. W., Poortinga, Y. H., Segall, M. H., & Dasen, P. R. (1992). ''Cross-cultural psychology: Research and applications.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Culture, as a whole, may also be defined as \"the shared way of life of a group of people.\"<ref name=\"Berry, J. W. 2011\"/> In contrast to sociologists, most cross-cultural psychologists do not draw a clear dividing line between social structure and cultural belief systems.\n\nEarly work in cross-cultural psychology was suggested in Lazarus and Steinthal's journal ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft'' [Journal of Folk Psychology and Language Science], which began to be published in 1860. More empirically oriented research was subsequently conducted by Williams H. R. Rivers (1864\u20131922) who attempted to measure the intelligence and sensory acuity of indigenous people residing in the Torres Straits area, located between Australia and New Guinea.<ref>[[Gustav Jahoda|Jahoda, G.]] (1993). ''Crossroads between culture and mind.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> The father of modern psychology, Wilhelm Wundt, published ten volumes on ''V\u00f6lkerpsychologie'' (a kind of historically oriented cultural psychology), but these volumes have had only limited influence in the English-speaking world.<ref>Wundt, W. (1900-1920). ''V\u00f6lkerpsychologie'' (Comparative Psychology of Peoples), vols.1-10. Leipzig, Germany: Engelmann.</ref> Wundt's student Franz Boas, an anthropologist at Columbia University, challenged several of his students such as Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead to study psychological phenomena in nonwestern cultures such as Japan, Samoa, and New Guinea. They emphasized the enormous cultural variability of many psychological phenomena thereby challenging psychologists to prove the cross-cultural validity of their favorite theories.\n\n==Etic v. emic perspectives==\n\nOther fields of psychology focus on how personal relationships impact human behavior; however, they fail to take into account the significant impact that culture may have on human behavior.<ref name=\"Cherry\"/> The Malinowskian dictum focuses on the idea that there is a necessity to understand the culture of a society in its own terms instead of the common search for finding universal laws that apply to all human behavior.<ref name=\"triandis\">{{cite journal|authorlink1=Harry C.

Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory is not only the springboard for one of the most active research traditions in cross-cultural psychology, but is also cited extensively in the management literature. His initial work found that cultures differ on four dimensions: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity-femininity, and individualism-collectivism.<ref>Hofstede, G. (2001). ''Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, institutions, and organizations across nations'' (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref> Later, after The Chinese Culture Connection extended his research using indigenous Chinese materials, he added a fifth dimension - long-term orientation (originally called Confucian dynamism) - which can be found in other cultures besides China.<ref name=CCC>{{cite journal | last1 =  | first1 =  | year = 1987 | title = Chinese values and the search for culture-free dimensions of culture | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 143\u2013164 | doi = 10.1177/0022002187018002002}}</ref> Still later, after work with Michael Minkov using data from the [[World Values Survey]], he added a sixth dimension - indulgence versus restraint.<ref>Minkov, Michael (2007).

''Cultures and organizations: Software of the Mind'' (3rd ed.).

Indeed, the individualism-collectivism debate has itself proven to be problematic, with Sinha and Tripathi (1994) arguing that strong individualistic and collectivistic orientations may coexist in the same culture (they discuss [[India]] in this connection).<ref>Kim, U., Triandis, H. C., Choi, S. C., Ka\u011fit\u00e7iba\u015fi, \u00c7., & Yoon, G. (Eds.). (1994). ''Individualism and collectivism: Theory, method, and applications.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref> This has proven to be a problem with many of the various linear dimensions that are, by nature, dichotomous. Cultures are much more complex and contextually based than represent in these inflexible dimensional representations.\n\n===Counseling and clinical psychology===\n\nCross-cultural clinical psychologists (e.g., [[Jefferson Fish]]<ref>Fish, J.

Fish titled \"Principles of Multicultural Counseling and Therapy\" contains numerous chapters on the application of culture in counseling. Joan D. Koss-Chioino, Louise Baca, and Luis A. Varrga are all listed in this book (in the chapter titled \"Group Therapy with Mexican American and Mexican Adolescents: Focus on Culture) as working with Latinos in their way of therapy that is known to be \"culturally sensitive\". For example, in their therapy they create a \"fourth life space\" that allows children/adolescents to reflect on difficulties they may be facing.<ref name=\"gielen\" /> Furthermore, in the book it is stated that various countries are now starting to incorporate multicultural interventions into their counseling practices. The countries listed included: Malaysia, Kuwait, China, Israel, Australia, and Serbia.<ref name=\"gielen\" /> Lastly, in the chapter titled \"Multiculturalism and School Counseling: Creating Relevant Comprehensive Guidance and Counseling Programs,\" Hardin L. K. Coleman, and Jennifer J. Lindwall propose a way to incorporate cultural components into school counseling programs. Specifically, they emphasize the necessity of the counselor's having multicultural competence and the ability to apply this knowledge when working with persons of varying ethnic backgrounds.<ref name=\"gielen\" /> In addition, several recent volumes have reviewed the state of counseling psychology and psychotherapy around the world while discussing cross-cultural similarities and differences in counseling practices.<ref name=\"Gerstein, L.H. 2009\"/><ref name=\"Moodley, R. 2013\"/><ref name=\"Moodley, R. 2015\"/>\n\n===Five-factor model of personality===\n{{Main|Big Five personality traits and culture}}\n\nCan the traits defined by American psychologists be generalized across people from different countries? In response to this questions, cross-cultural psychologists have often questioned how to compare traits across cultures. To examine this question, lexical studies measuring personality factors using trait adjectives from various languages have been conducted.<ref name=\"mc\">{{cite web|last=McCrae|first=R. R.|title=Cross-cultural research on the five-factor model of personality|url=http://www.wwu.edu/culture/mccrae.htm|work=In W. J. Lonner, D. L. Dinnel, S. A. Hayes, & D. N. Sattler (Eds.) Online Readings in Psychology and Culture (Unit 6, Chapter 1)|publisher=Center for Cross-Cultural Research, Western Washington University Bellingham, Washington USA|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> Over time these studies have concluded that the factors of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness almost always appear, yet Neuroticism and Openness to Experience sometimes do not. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether these traits are nonexistent in certain cultures or whether different sets of adjectives must be used to measure them. However, many researches believe that the FFM is a universal structure and can be used within cross-cultural research and research studies in general. However, other cultures may include even more significant traits that go beyond those traits included in the FFM.<ref name=\"mc\" />\n\n===Emotion judgments===\n\nResearchers have often wondered whether people across various cultures interpret emotions in similar ways. In the field of cross-cultural psychology, Paul Ekman has conducted research examining judgments in [[facial expression]] cross-culturally. One of his studies included participants from ten different cultures who were required to indicate emotions and the intensity of each emotion based upon picture of persons expressing various emotions.

Nevertheless, it is also important to note that in the study there were differences in the way in which participants across cultures rated emotion intensity.<ref name=\"ekman\" />\n\nWhile there are said to be universally recognized facial expressions, Yueqin Huang and his colleagues performed research that looked at how a culture may apply different labels to certain expressions of emotions. Huang et al. (2001) in particular compared Chinese versus American perceptions of facial emotion expressions. They found that the Chinese participants were not as skilled as the American participants at perceiving the universal emotional expressions of people coming from a culture different than their own.<ref name=\"HuangTang2001\">{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Yueqin|last2=Tang|first2=Siu|last3=Helmeste|first3=Daiga|last4=Shioiri|first4=Toshiki|last5=Someya|first5=Toshiyuki|title=Differential judgement of static facial expressions of emotions in three cultures|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=55|issue=5|year=2001|pages=479\u2013483|issn=1323-1316|doi=10.1046/j.1440-1819.2001.00893.x|pmid=11555343}}</ref> These findings show support for the notion that cross-cultural differences exist in emotional judgement. Huang et al. (2001) suggest that Asians may use different cues on the face to interpret the emotional expression. Also, because every culture has different values and norms, it is important to analyze those differences in order to gain a better understanding as to why certain emotions are either interpreted differently or not at all. For example, as Huang et al. (2001) point out, it is common for \u2018negative emotions\u2019 not to be welcomed in many Asian cultures. This important information may be critical in recognizing the cross-cultural difference between Asian and American judgments of the universal emotional expressions.<ref name=\"HuangTang2001\"/>\n\nTrnka et al. (2018) argued: \"cultural variations in emotions have been documented in previous research, but a general theoretical framework involving cultural sources of these variations is still missing.\" and proposed framework\u00a0 which conceptually distinguishes five main components of cultural complexity relating to emotions: \u201c1) emotion language, 2) conceptual knowledge about emotions, 3) emotion-related values, 4) feelings rules, i.e. norms for subjective experience, and 5) display rules, i.e. norms for emotional expression.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trnka|first=Radek|last2=Pol\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 \u0160olcov\u00e1|first2=Iva|last3=Tavel|first3=Peter|date=2018|title=Components of cultural complexity relating to emotions: A conceptual framework|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325487029|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|language=en|volume=51|pages=27\u201333|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2018.05.001|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Differences in subjective well-being===\n{{Also|Culture and positive psychology|Subjective well-being#Cultural variations}}\n\nThe term \"subjective well-being\" is frequently used throughout psychology research and is made up of three main parts: 1) [[life satisfaction]] (a cognitive evaluation of one's overall life), 2) the presence of positive emotional experiences, and 3) the absence of negative emotional experiences.<ref name=\"suh\">{{cite web|author1=Suh, E.M  |author2=Oishi, S.|title=Subjective well-being across cultures|url=http://www.wwu.edu/culture/Suh_Oishi.htm|work=In W. J. Lonner, D. L. Dinnel, S., Online Readings in Psychology and Culture A. Hayes, & D. N. Sattler|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref> Across cultures people may have differing opinions on the \"ideal\" level of subjective well-being. For example, Brazilians have been shown in studies to find positive emotions very desirable whereas the Chinese did not score as highly on the desire for positive emotions.<ref name=\"suh\" /> Consequently, when comparing subjective well-being cross-culturally it appears important to take into account how the individuals in one culture may rate one aspect differently from individuals from another culture. It is difficult to identify a universal indicator as to how much subjective well-being individuals in different societies experience over a period of time.<ref name=\"suh\" /> One important topic is whether individuals from individualistic or collectivistic countries are happier and rate higher on subjective well-being. Diener, Diener, and Diener, 1995, noted that individualist cultural members are found to be happier than collectivist cultural members.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Diener|first=E.|author2=M. Diener |author3=C. Diener |title=Factors predicting subjective well-being of nations|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|issue=5|pages=851\u2013864|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.851}}</ref> It is also important to note that happier nations may not always be the wealthier nations. While there are strong associations between cultural average income and subjective well-being, the \"richer=happier\" argument is still a topic of hot debate. One factor that may contribute to this debate is that nations that are economically stable may also contain various non-materialistic features such as a more stable democratic government, better enforcement of human rights, etc. that could overall contribute to a higher subjective well-being. Therefore, it has yet to be determined whether a higher level of subjective well-being is linked to material affluence or whether it is shaped by other features that wealthy societies often possess and that may serve as intermediate links between affluence and well-being.<ref name=\"suh\" />\n\n===How different cultures resolve conflict===\n\nGrossmann et al. use evidence to show how cultures differ in the ways they approach [[social conflict]] and how culture continues to be an important factor in human development even into old age. Specifically, the paper examines aging-related differences in wise reasoning among the American and Japanese cultures. Participants' responses revealed that wisdom (e.g., recognition of multiple perspectives, one's limits of personal knowledge, and the importance of compromise) increased with age among Americans, but older age was not directly associated with wiser responses amongst the Japanese participants. Furthermore, younger and middle-aged Japanese participants illustrated higher scores than Americans for resolving group conflicts.<ref name=\"GrossmannKarasawa2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Grossmann|first1=I.|last2=Karasawa|first2=M.|last3=Izumi|first3=S.|last4=Na|first4=J.|last5=Varnum|first5=M.

The Japanese are motivated to maintain interpersonal harmony and avoid conflict, resolve conflict better, and are wiser earlier in their lives. Americans experience conflict gradually, which results in continuous learning about how to solve conflict and increased wisdom in their later years. The current study supported the concept that varying cultures use different methods to resolve conflict.<ref name=\"GrossmannKarasawa2012\"/>\n\nDifferences in conflict resolution across cultures can also be seen with the inclusion of a third party. These differences can be found when a third party becomes involved and provides a solution to the conflict.<ref name=\"NoRespectForFamily1992\">{{cite journal|last1=Lieche|first1=Diane|title=Comparison of the American mediation process with a Korean-American harmony restoration process|journal=Conflict Resolution Quarterly|volume=9|issue=4|year=1992|pages=323\u2013339|issn=1536-5581|doi=10.1002/crq.3900090405}}</ref> Asian and American cultural practices play a role in the way the members of the two cultures handle conflict. A technique used by Korean-Americans may reflect Confucian values<ref name=\"NoRespectForFamily1992\"/> while the American technique will be consistent with their individualistic and capitalistic views. Americans will have more structure in their processes which provides standards for similar situations in the future. Contrary to American ways, Korean-Americans will not have as much structure in resolving their conflicts, but more flexibility while solving a problem. For Korean-Americans, the correct way may not always be set but can usually be narrowed down to a few possible solutions.\n\n===Gender-role and gender-identity differences and similarities===\n\nWilliams and Best (1990) have looked at different societies in terms of prevailing gender stereotypes, gender-linked self-perceptions, and gender roles. The authors found both universal similarities as well as differences between and within more than 30 nations.<ref>Williams, J. E., & Best, D. L. (1990). ''Sex and psyche: Gender and self viewed cross-culturally.'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage.</ref> The ''Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology'' also contains a fine review on the topic of Sex, Gender, and Culture. One of the main findings overall was that under the topic of sex and gender, pan-cultural similarities were shown to be greater than cultural differences.<ref name=\"best\">{{cite journal|last=Best|first=D.|author2=J. Williams |title=Social Behavior and Applications; Sex, Gender, and Culture|journal=Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=1997|volume=3|pages=163\u2013212}}</ref>  Furthermore, across cultures the way in which men and women relate to one another in social groups has been shown to be fairly similar.<ref name=\"best\" /> Further calls have been made to examine theories of gender development as well as how culture influences the behavior of both males and females.<ref name=\"best\" />\n\n===Cross-cultural human development===\n\nThis topic represents a specialized area of cross-cultural psychology and can be viewed as the study of cultural similarities  and differences in developmental processes and their outcomes as expressed by behavior and mental processes in individuals and groups. As presented by Bornstein (2010),<ref>Bornstein, M.E. (Eds.). (2010). ''Handbook of cultural developmental science.'' New York: Psychology Press.</ref> Gielen and Roopnarine (2016) and Gardiner and Kosmitzki (2010), researchers in this area have examined various topics and domains of psychology (e.g., theories and methodology, socialization, families, gender roles and gender differences, the effects of immigration on identity), human development across the human life cycle in various parts of the world, children in difficult circumstances such as street children and war-traumatized adolescents, and global comparisons between, and influences on, children and adults. Because only 3.4% of the world's children live in the United States, such research is urgently needed to correct the ethnocentric presentations that can be found in many American textbooks (Gielen, 2016).\n\nBerry et al. refer to evidence that a number of different dimensions have been found in cross-cultural  comparisons of [[Parenting|childrearing]] practices, including differences on the dimensions of obedience training, responsibility training, nurturance training (the degree to which a sibling will care for  other siblings or for older people), achievement training, self-reliance, and autonomy;<ref>Berry, J.

Super and Sara Harkness) on cross-cultural influences on child development. They stated that three recurring topics were shown to consistently come up during their review: \"how best to conceptualize variability within and across cultural settings, to characterize activities of the child's mind, and to improve methodological research in culture and development.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Super|first=Charles M.|author2=Sara Harkness |title=Basic Processes and Human Development: The Cultural Structuring of Child Development|journal=The Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=1997|volume=2|pages=1\u201339}}</ref>\n\n==Future developments==\n\nThe rise of cross-cultural psychology reflects a general process of globalization in the social sciences that seeks to purify specific areas of research which have western biases. In this way, cross-cultural psychology (together with [[international psychology]]) aims to make psychology less ethnocentric in character than it has been in the past. Cross-cultural psychology is now taught at numerous universities located around the world, both as a specific content area as well as a methodological approach designed to broaden the field of psychology.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cross-cultural psychiatry]]\n*[[Cross-cultural leadership]]\n*[[Cross-cultural studies]]\n*[[Cultural psychology]]\n*[[International psychology]]\n*[[Social Axioms Survey]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Berry, J.

''Methods and Data Analysis for Cross-Cultural Research.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1997</ref> Although some critics have pointed to methodological flaws in cross-cultural psychological research and claim that serious shortcomings in the theoretical and methodological bases used impede rather than help the scientific search for universal principles in psychology, cross-cultural psychologists are turning more to the study of how differences (variance) occur, rather than searching for universals in the style of physics or chemistry.<ref name=\"Gielen2004\" /><ref name=\"Smith2013\" />\n\nWhile cross-cultural psychology represented only a minor area of psychology prior to WWII, it began to grow in importance during the 1960s. In 1971, the interdisciplinary Society for Cross-Cultural Research (SCCR) was founded, and in 1972 the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP) was established.<ref name=\"Cherry\">{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=What is Cross Cultural Psychology|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/branchesofpsycholog1/f/cross-cultural.htm|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> Since then, this branch of psychology has continued to expand as there has been an increasing popularity of incorporating culture and diversity into studies of numerous psychological phenomena.\n\nCross-cultural psychology is differentiated from [[cultural psychology]], which refers to the branch of psychology that holds that human behavior is strongly influenced by cultural differences, meaning that psychological phenomena can only be compared with each other across cultures to a limited extent. In contrast, cross-cultural psychology includes a search for possible universals in behavior and mental processes. Cross-cultural psychology \"can be thought of as a type [of] [[research methodology]], rather than an entirely separate field within psychology\".<ref name=\"Cherry\"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lonner | first1 = W.

Nevertheless, cross-cultural psychology, cultural psychology, and international psychology are united by a common concern for expanding psychology into a universal discipline capable of understanding psychological phenomena across cultures and in a global context.\n\n==Definitions and early work==\nTwo definitions of the field include: \"the scientific study of human behavior and its transmission, taking into account the ways in which behaviors are shaped and influenced by social and cultural forces\"<ref name=\"Berry, J. W. 2011\">Berry, J. W., & Poortinga, Y. H. (2011). ''Cross-cultural psychology: Research and applications'' (3rd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> and \"the empirical study of members of various cultural groups who have had different experiences that lead to predictable and significant differences in behavior\".<ref>Brislin, Lonner, & Thorndike, 1973 as cited in Berry, J. W., Poortinga, Y. H., Segall, M. H., & Dasen, P. R. (1992). ''Cross-cultural psychology: Research and applications.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Culture, as a whole, may also be defined as \"the shared way of life of a group of people.\"<ref name=\"Berry, J. W. 2011\"/> In contrast to sociologists, most cross-cultural psychologists do not draw a clear dividing line between social structure and cultural belief systems.\n\nEarly work in cross-cultural psychology was suggested in Lazarus and Steinthal's journal ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft'' [Journal of Folk Psychology and Language Science], which began to be published in 1860. More empirically oriented research was subsequently conducted by Williams H. R. Rivers (1864\u20131922) who attempted to measure the intelligence and sensory acuity of indigenous people residing in the Torres Straits area, located between Australia and New Guinea.<ref>[[Gustav Jahoda|Jahoda, G.]] (1993). ''Crossroads between culture and mind.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> The father of modern psychology, Wilhelm Wundt, published ten volumes on ''V\u00f6lkerpsychologie'' (a kind of historically oriented cultural psychology), but these volumes have had only limited influence in the English-speaking world.<ref>Wundt, W. (1900-1920). ''V\u00f6lkerpsychologie'' (Comparative Psychology of Peoples), vols.1-10. Leipzig, Germany: Engelmann.</ref> Wundt's student Franz Boas, an anthropologist at Columbia University, challenged several of his students such as Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead to study psychological phenomena in nonwestern cultures such as Japan, Samoa, and New Guinea. They emphasized the enormous cultural variability of many psychological phenomena thereby challenging psychologists to prove the cross-cultural validity of their favorite theories.\n\n==Etic v. emic perspectives==\n\nOther fields of psychology focus on how personal relationships impact human behavior; however, they fail to take into account the significant impact that culture may have on human behavior.<ref name=\"Cherry\"/> The Malinowskian dictum focuses on the idea that there is a necessity to understand the culture of a society in its own terms instead of the common search for finding universal laws that apply to all human behavior.<ref name=\"triandis\">{{cite journal|authorlink1=Harry C.

Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory is not only the springboard for one of the most active research traditions in cross-cultural psychology, but is also cited extensively in the management literature. His initial work found that cultures differ on four dimensions: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity-femininity, and individualism-collectivism.<ref>Hofstede, G. (2001). ''Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, institutions, and organizations across nations'' (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref> Later, after The Chinese Culture Connection extended his research using indigenous Chinese materials, he added a fifth dimension - long-term orientation (originally called Confucian dynamism) - which can be found in other cultures besides China.<ref name=CCC>{{cite journal | last1 =  | first1 =  | year = 1987 | title = Chinese values and the search for culture-free dimensions of culture | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 143\u2013164 | doi = 10.1177/0022002187018002002}}</ref> Still later, after work with Michael Minkov using data from the [[World Values Survey]], he added a sixth dimension - indulgence versus restraint.<ref>Minkov, Michael (2007).

Indeed, the individualism-collectivism debate has itself proven to be problematic, with Sinha and Tripathi (1994) arguing that strong individualistic and collectivistic orientations may coexist in the same culture (they discuss [[India]] in this connection).<ref>Kim, U., Triandis, H. C., Choi, S. C., Ka\u011fit\u00e7iba\u015fi, \u00c7., & Yoon, G. (Eds.). (1994). ''Individualism and collectivism: Theory, method, and applications.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref> This has proven to be a problem with many of the various linear dimensions that are, by nature, dichotomous. Cultures are much more complex and contextually based than represent in these inflexible dimensional representations.\n\n===Counseling and clinical psychology===\n\nCross-cultural clinical psychologists (e.g., [[Jefferson Fish]]<ref>Fish, J. M. (1996).  ''Culture and therapy: An integrative approach.''  Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson.</ref><ref name=\"gielen\">Gielen, U. P., Draguns, J. G., & Fish, J. M.  (Eds.)  (2008).

Fish titled \"Principles of Multicultural Counseling and Therapy\" contains numerous chapters on the application of culture in counseling. Joan D. Koss-Chioino, Louise Baca, and Luis A. Varrga are all listed in this book (in the chapter titled \"Group Therapy with Mexican American and Mexican Adolescents: Focus on Culture) as working with Latinos in their way of therapy that is known to be \"culturally sensitive\". For example, in their therapy they create a \"fourth life space\" that allows children/adolescents to reflect on difficulties they may be facing.<ref name=\"gielen\" /> Furthermore, in the book it is stated that various countries are now starting to incorporate multicultural interventions into their counseling practices. The countries listed included: Malaysia, Kuwait, China, Israel, Australia, and Serbia.<ref name=\"gielen\" /> Lastly, in the chapter titled \"Multiculturalism and School Counseling: Creating Relevant Comprehensive Guidance and Counseling Programs,\" Hardin L. K. Coleman, and Jennifer J. Lindwall propose a way to incorporate cultural components into school counseling programs. Specifically, they emphasize the necessity of the counselor's having multicultural competence and the ability to apply this knowledge when working with persons of varying ethnic backgrounds.<ref name=\"gielen\" /> In addition, several recent volumes have reviewed the state of counseling psychology and psychotherapy around the world while discussing cross-cultural similarities and differences in counseling practices.<ref name=\"Gerstein, L.H. 2009\"/><ref name=\"Moodley, R. 2013\"/><ref name=\"Moodley, R. 2015\"/>\n\n===Five-factor model of personality===\n{{Main|Big Five personality traits and culture}}\n\nCan the traits defined by American psychologists be generalized across people from different countries? In response to this questions, cross-cultural psychologists have often questioned how to compare traits across cultures. To examine this question, lexical studies measuring personality factors using trait adjectives from various languages have been conducted.<ref name=\"mc\">{{cite web|last=McCrae|first=R. R.|title=Cross-cultural research on the five-factor model of personality|url=http://www.wwu.edu/culture/mccrae.htm|work=In W. J. Lonner, D. L. Dinnel, S. A. Hayes, & D. N. Sattler (Eds.) Online Readings in Psychology and Culture (Unit 6, Chapter 1)|publisher=Center for Cross-Cultural Research, Western Washington University Bellingham, Washington USA|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> Over time these studies have concluded that the factors of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness almost always appear, yet Neuroticism and Openness to Experience sometimes do not. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether these traits are nonexistent in certain cultures or whether different sets of adjectives must be used to measure them. However, many researches believe that the FFM is a universal structure and can be used within cross-cultural research and research studies in general. However, other cultures may include even more significant traits that go beyond those traits included in the FFM.<ref name=\"mc\" />\n\n===Emotion judgments===\n\nResearchers have often wondered whether people across various cultures interpret emotions in similar ways. In the field of cross-cultural psychology, Paul Ekman has conducted research examining judgments in [[facial expression]] cross-culturally. One of his studies included participants from ten different cultures who were required to indicate emotions and the intensity of each emotion based upon picture of persons expressing various emotions. The results of the study showed that there was agreement across cultures as to which emotions were the most and second most intense.<ref name=\"ekman\">{{cite journal|last=Ekman|first=Paul |author2=Wallace V.

Nevertheless, it is also important to note that in the study there were differences in the way in which participants across cultures rated emotion intensity.<ref name=\"ekman\" />\n\nWhile there are said to be universally recognized facial expressions, Yueqin Huang and his colleagues performed research that looked at how a culture may apply different labels to certain expressions of emotions. Huang et al. (2001) in particular compared Chinese versus American perceptions of facial emotion expressions. They found that the Chinese participants were not as skilled as the American participants at perceiving the universal emotional expressions of people coming from a culture different than their own.<ref name=\"HuangTang2001\">{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Yueqin|last2=Tang|first2=Siu|last3=Helmeste|first3=Daiga|last4=Shioiri|first4=Toshiki|last5=Someya|first5=Toshiyuki|title=Differential judgement of static facial expressions of emotions in three cultures|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=55|issue=5|year=2001|pages=479\u2013483|issn=1323-1316|doi=10.1046/j.1440-1819.2001.00893.x|pmid=11555343}}</ref> These findings show support for the notion that cross-cultural differences exist in emotional judgement. Huang et al. (2001) suggest that Asians may use different cues on the face to interpret the emotional expression. Also, because every culture has different values and norms, it is important to analyze those differences in order to gain a better understanding as to why certain emotions are either interpreted differently or not at all. For example, as Huang et al. (2001) point out, it is common for \u2018negative emotions\u2019 not to be welcomed in many Asian cultures. This important information may be critical in recognizing the cross-cultural difference between Asian and American judgments of the universal emotional expressions.<ref name=\"HuangTang2001\"/>\n\nTrnka et al. (2018) argued: \"cultural variations in emotions have been documented in previous research, but a general theoretical framework involving cultural sources of these variations is still missing.\" and proposed framework\u00a0 which conceptually distinguishes five main components of cultural complexity relating to emotions: \u201c1) emotion language, 2) conceptual knowledge about emotions, 3) emotion-related values, 4) feelings rules, i.e. norms for subjective experience, and 5) display rules, i.e. norms for emotional expression.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trnka|first=Radek|last2=Pol\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 \u0160olcov\u00e1|first2=Iva|last3=Tavel|first3=Peter|date=2018|title=Components of cultural complexity relating to emotions: A conceptual framework|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325487029|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|language=en|volume=51|pages=27\u201333|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2018.05.001|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Differences in subjective well-being===\n{{Also|Subjective well-being#Cultural variations}}\n\nThe term \"subjective well-being\" is frequently used throughout psychology research and is made up of three main parts: 1) [[life satisfaction]] (a cognitive evaluation of one's overall life), 2) the presence of positive emotional experiences, and 3) the absence of negative emotional experiences.<ref name=\"suh\">{{cite web|author1=Suh, E.M  |author2=Oishi, S.|title=Subjective well-being across cultures|url=http://www.wwu.edu/culture/Suh_Oishi.htm|work=In W. J. Lonner, D. L. Dinnel, S., Online Readings in Psychology and Culture A. Hayes, & D. N. Sattler|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref> Across cultures people may have differing opinions on the \"ideal\" level of subjective well-being. For example, Brazilians have been shown in studies to find positive emotions very desirable whereas the Chinese did not score as highly on the desire for positive emotions.<ref name=\"suh\" /> Consequently, when comparing subjective well-being cross-culturally it appears important to take into account how the individuals in one culture may rate one aspect differently from individuals from another culture. It is difficult to identify a universal indicator as to how much subjective well-being individuals in different societies experience over a period of time.<ref name=\"suh\" /> One important topic is whether individuals from individualistic or collectivistic countries are happier and rate higher on subjective well-being. Diener, Diener, and Diener, 1995, noted that individualist cultural members are found to be happier than collectivist cultural members.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Diener|first=E.|author2=M. Diener |author3=C. Diener |title=Factors predicting subjective well-being of nations|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|issue=5|pages=851\u2013864|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.851}}</ref> It is also important to note that happier nations may not always be the wealthier nations. While there are strong associations between cultural average income and subjective well-being, the \"richer=happier\" argument is still a topic of hot debate. One factor that may contribute to this debate is that nations that are economically stable may also contain various non-materialistic features such as a more stable democratic government, better enforcement of human rights, etc. that could overall contribute to a higher subjective well-being. Therefore, it has yet to be determined whether a higher level of subjective well-being is linked to material affluence or whether it is shaped by other features that wealthy societies often possess and that may serve as intermediate links between affluence and well-being.<ref name=\"suh\" />\n\n===How different cultures resolve conflict===\n\nGrossmann et al. use evidence to show how cultures differ in the ways they approach [[social conflict]] and how culture continues to be an important factor in human development even into old age. Specifically, the paper examines aging-related differences in wise reasoning among the American and Japanese cultures. Participants' responses revealed that wisdom (e.g., recognition of multiple perspectives, one's limits of personal knowledge, and the importance of compromise) increased with age among Americans, but older age was not directly associated with wiser responses amongst the Japanese participants. Furthermore, younger and middle-aged Japanese participants illustrated higher scores than Americans for resolving group conflicts.<ref name=\"GrossmannKarasawa2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Grossmann|first1=I.|last2=Karasawa|first2=M.|last3=Izumi|first3=S.|last4=Na|first4=J.|last5=Varnum|first5=M.

The Japanese are motivated to maintain interpersonal harmony and avoid conflict, resolve conflict better, and are wiser earlier in their lives. Americans experience conflict gradually, which results in continuous learning about how to solve conflict and increased wisdom in their later years. The current study supported the concept that varying cultures use different methods to resolve conflict.<ref name=\"GrossmannKarasawa2012\"/>\n\nDifferences in conflict resolution across cultures can also be seen with the inclusion of a third party. These differences can be found when a third party becomes involved and provides a solution to the conflict.<ref name=\"NoRespectForFamily1992\">{{cite journal|last1=Lieche|first1=Diane|title=Comparison of the American mediation process with a Korean-American harmony restoration process|journal=Conflict Resolution Quarterly|volume=9|issue=4|year=1992|pages=323\u2013339|issn=1536-5581|doi=10.1002/crq.3900090405}}</ref> Asian and American cultural practices play a role in the way the members of the two cultures handle conflict. A technique used by Korean-Americans may reflect Confucian values<ref name=\"NoRespectForFamily1992\"/> while the American technique will be consistent with their individualistic and capitalistic views. Americans will have more structure in their processes which provides standards for similar situations in the future. Contrary to American ways, Korean-Americans will not have as much structure in resolving their conflicts, but more flexibility while solving a problem. For Korean-Americans, the correct way may not always be set but can usually be narrowed down to a few possible solutions.\n\n===Gender-role and gender-identity differences and similarities===\n\nWilliams and Best (1990) have looked at different societies in terms of prevailing gender stereotypes, gender-linked self-perceptions, and gender roles. The authors found both universal similarities as well as differences between and within more than 30 nations.<ref>Williams, J. E., & Best, D. L. (1990). ''Sex and psyche: Gender and self viewed cross-culturally.'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage.</ref> The ''Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology'' also contains a fine review on the topic of Sex, Gender, and Culture. One of the main findings overall was that under the topic of sex and gender, pan-cultural similarities were shown to be greater than cultural differences.<ref name=\"best\">{{cite journal|last=Best|first=D.|author2=J. Williams |title=Social Behavior and Applications; Sex, Gender, and Culture|journal=Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=1997|volume=3|pages=163\u2013212}}</ref>  Furthermore, across cultures the way in which men and women relate to one another in social groups has been shown to be fairly similar.<ref name=\"best\" /> Further calls have been made to examine theories of gender development as well as how culture influences the behavior of both males and females.<ref name=\"best\" />\n\n===Cross-cultural human development===\n\nThis topic represents a specialized area of cross-cultural psychology and can be viewed as the study of cultural similarities  and differences in developmental processes and their outcomes as expressed by behavior and mental processes in individuals and groups. As presented by Bornstein (2010),<ref>Bornstein, M.E. (Eds.). (2010). ''Handbook of cultural developmental science.'' New York: Psychology Press.</ref> Gielen and Roopnarine (2016) and Gardiner and Kosmitzki (2010), researchers in this area have examined various topics and domains of psychology (e.g., theories and methodology, socialization, families, gender roles and gender differences, the effects of immigration on identity), human development across the human life cycle in various parts of the world, children in difficult circumstances such as street children and war-traumatized adolescents, and global comparisons between, and influences on, children and adults. Because only 3.4% of the world's children live in the United States, such research is urgently needed to correct the ethnocentric presentations that can be found in many American textbooks (Gielen, 2016).\n\nBerry et al. refer to evidence that a number of different dimensions have been found in cross-cultural  comparisons of [[Parenting|childrearing]] practices, including differences on the dimensions of obedience training, responsibility training, nurturance training (the degree to which a sibling will care for  other siblings or for older people), achievement training, self-reliance, and autonomy;<ref>Berry, J.

Super and Sara Harkness) on cross-cultural influences on child development. They stated that three recurring topics were shown to consistently come up during their review: \"how best to conceptualize variability within and across cultural settings, to characterize activities of the child's mind, and to improve methodological research in culture and development.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Super|first=Charles M.|author2=Sara Harkness |title=Basic Processes and Human Development: The Cultural Structuring of Child Development|journal=The Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=1997|volume=2|pages=1\u201339}}</ref>\n\n==Future developments==\n\nThe rise of cross-cultural psychology reflects a general process of globalization in the social sciences that seeks to purify specific areas of research which have western biases. In this way, cross-cultural psychology (together with [[international psychology]]) aims to make psychology less ethnocentric in character than it has been in the past. Cross-cultural psychology is now taught at numerous universities located around the world, both as a specific content area as well as a methodological approach designed to broaden the field of psychology.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cross-cultural psychiatry]]\n*[[Cross-cultural leadership]]\n*[[Cross-cultural studies]]\n*[[Cultural psychology]]\n*[[International psychology]]\n*[[Social Axioms Survey]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Berry, J.

It is a small mountain town, with its main industry being [[Salt mine|salt mining]] and a nearby [[Thermal bath|spa]]. As of 2013, the town has a population of 2,607 inhabitants, while the municipality has 13,409 inhabitants.\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]], Srebrenica was the site of a [[Srebrenica massacre|massacre]] of more than 8,000 [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] men and boys, which was subsequently designated as an act of [[genocide]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and the [[International Court of Justice]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman era===\nDuring the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, there was a settlement of Domavia, known to have been near a mine. Silver ore from there was moved to the mints in [[Salona]] in the southwest and [[Sirmium]] in the northeast using the [[Via Argentaria]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 13th and 14th century the region was part of the [[Banate of Bosnia]], and, subsequently, the [[Bosnian Kingdom]].  The earliest reference to the name Srebrenica was in 1376, by which time it was already an important centre for trade in the western Balkans, based especially on the silver mines of the region. (Compare modern [[wikt:srebro|srebro]] \"silver\".) By that time, a large number of merchants of the [[Republic of Ragusa]] were established there, and they controlled the domestic silver trade and the export by sea, almost entirely via the port of Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]).<ref>Konstantin Jire\u010dek: ''Die Handelsstrassen und Bergwerke von Serbien und Bosnien w\u00e4hrend des Mittelalters: historisch-geographische Studien''. Prag: Verl. der K\u00f6n. B\u00f6hmischen Ges. der Wiss., 1879</ref> During the 14th century, many German miners moved into the area.<ref>Mihailo Dini\u0107: ''Za istoriju rudarstva u srednjevekovnoj Srbiji i Bosni'', S. 46</ref>  There were often armed conflicts about Srebrenica because of its mines. According to Czech historian [[Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek]], from 1410 to 1460, Srebrenica switched hands several times, being Serbian five times, Bosnian four times, and Ottoman three times. The mines of Bosnian [[Podrinje]] and [[Usora (region)|Usora]] were part of the [[Serbian Despotate]] prior to the Ottoman conquest.<ref name=\"Kulenovi\u01071995\">{{cite book|author=Salih Kulenovi\u0107|title=Etnologija sjeveroisto\u010dne Bosne: rasprave, studije, \u010dlanci|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G90xAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Muzej isto\u010dne Bosne|page=20}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman period===\nWith the town coming under Ottoman rule, becoming less influenced by the Republic of Ragusa, the economic importance of Srebrenica went into decline, as did the proportion of Christians in the population. The [[Franciscan]] monastery was converted into a mosque, but the large number of Catholics, Ragusan and Saxon, caused the transformation of the town to Islam to be slower than in most of the other towns in the area.<ref>''A Short History of Bosnia'', S. 53 ff.</ref>\n\nThe area of [[Osat]] was liberated for a short time during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u201313), under the leadership of Kara-Marko Vasi\u0107 from [[Crvica, Srebrenica|Crvica]]. Upon the breakout of the uprising, Metropolitan Had\u017ei Melentije Stevanovi\u0107 contacted Vasi\u0107, who met with the rebel leadership. After participated in battles on the Drina (1804), Vasi\u0107 asked [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] for an army to liberate Osat; Lazar Mutap was dispatched and the region came under rebel rule. In 1808, the Ottomans cleared out Osat, and by 1813, the rebels left the region.\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the [[Second World War]] there were many atrocities committed by the [[Chetniks]] and Ustashas. Partisans fought [[Chetniks]] and [[Ustashe]] during the war and the people of Srebrenica built a partisan memorial cemetery monument for the fallen victims.\n\n===Bosnian War===\n{{main article|Srebrenica massacre|Bosnian genocide}}\nThe town of Srebrenica came to international prominence as a result of events during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992\u20131995). The strategic objectives proclaimed by the secessionist Bosnian Serb presidency included the creation of a border separating the Serb people from Bosnia's other ethnic communities and the abolition of the border along the River [[Drina]] separating Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs' Republika Srpska.<ref>http://www.icty.org/x/cases/tolimir/ind/en/tol-ii050210e.htm</ref> The Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak majority population of the Drina Valley posed a major obstacle to the achievement of these objectives. In the early days of the campaign of forcible transfer (ethnic cleansing) that followed the outbreak of war in April 1992 the town of Srebrenica was occupied by Serb/Serbian forces. It was subsequently retaken by Bosniak resistance groups. Refugees expelled from towns and villages across the central Drina valley sought shelter in Srebrenica, swelling the town's population.\n\nThe town and its surrounding area was surrounded and [[Siege of Srebrenica|besieged by Serb forces]]. On 16 April 1993, the [[United Nations]] declared the Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] a [[United Nations Safe Areas|UN safe area]], to be \"free from any armed attack or any other hostile act\", and guarded by a small Dutch unit operating under the mandate of [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR), which did nothing to defend the local population. \n\nSrebrenica and the other UN safe areas of [[\u017depa]] and [[Gora\u017ede]] were isolated pockets of Bosnian government-held territory in eastern Bosnia. In July 1995, despite the town's UN-protected status, it was attacked and captured by the [[Army of Republika Srpska]]. Following the town's capture, all men of fighting age who fell into Bosnian Serb hands were massacred in a systematically organised series of summary executions. The women of the town and men below 12 years of age and above 65 were transferred by bus to [[Tuzla]].\n\nThe [[Srebrenica massacre]] is considered the worst genocide in post-Second World War European history to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Srebrenica reburies 308 victims of massacre|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25639691|date=11 July 2008|work=NBC News|accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Srebrenica massacre was determined by judgement of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) to have been a crime of [[genocide]] (confirmed on appeal in 2004).<ref>{{cite web|title=Krstic \u2013 Judgement |url=https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|date=19 April 2004|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]|accessdate=11 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710085141/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|archivedate=10 July 2008}}</ref> This finding was upheld in 2007 by the [[International Court of Justice]].

Although guaranteed under the provisions of the Dayton Agreement, the return of survivors was repeatedly obstructed.

Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosnian Muslim village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Poto\u010dari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosnian Muslim settlements were routinely attacked as well. All this resulted in a great number of refugees and casualties.\"}}\n\n====British Army Documents Declassified in 2019====\n\nThe British National Archives in Kew released the documents dating back to July 1995 which deal with communication between British military and political actors during the Bosnian war. \n\nSeveral of the reports appear to blame the Bosniak Army (BiH) for provoking the Srebrenica attack. British intelligence doubted that Pale (Bosnian Serb headquarters) had any plans to overrun Srebrenica. Instead, the manoeuvre came as a response due to repeated Bosniak Army (BiH) attacks on BSA (Bosnian Serb Army) supply lines.\n\n{{quotation|The recent BSA (Bosnian Serb Army) attack on Srebrenica enclave was prompted by constant BiH (Bosniak Army) attacks over the previous 3 months on BSA supply route to the south of the enclave.

It is a small mountain town, with its main industry being [[Salt mine|salt mining]] and a nearby [[Thermal bath|spa]]. As of 2013, the town has a population of 2,604 inhabitants, while the municipality has 13,409 inhabitants.\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]], Srebrenica was the site of a [[Srebrenica massacre|massacre]] of more than 8,000 [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] men and boys, which was subsequently designated as an act of [[genocide]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and the [[International Court of Justice]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman era===\nDuring the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, there was a settlement of Domavia, known to have been near a mine. Silver ore from there was moved to the mints in [[Salona]] in the southwest and [[Sirmium]] in the northeast using the [[Via Argentaria]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 13th and 14th century the region was part of the [[Banate of Bosnia]], and, subsequently, the [[Bosnian Kingdom]].  The earliest reference to the name Srebrenica was in 1376, by which time it was already an important centre for trade in the western Balkans, based especially on the silver mines of the region. (Compare modern [[wikt:srebro|srebro]] \"silver\".) By that time, a large number of merchants of the [[Republic of Ragusa]] were established there, and they controlled the domestic silver trade and the export by sea, almost entirely via the port of Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]).<ref>Konstantin Jire\u010dek: ''Die Handelsstrassen und Bergwerke von Serbien und Bosnien w\u00e4hrend des Mittelalters: historisch-geographische Studien''.

According to Czech historian [[Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek]], from 1410 to 1460, Srebrenica switched hands several times, being Serbian five times, Bosnian four times, and Ottoman three times. The mines of Bosnian [[Podrinje]] and [[Usora (region)|Usora]] were part of the [[Serbian Despotate]] prior to the Ottoman conquest.<ref name=\"Kulenovi\u01071995\">{{cite book|author=Salih Kulenovi\u0107|title=Etnologija sjeveroisto\u010dne Bosne: rasprave, studije, \u010dlanci|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G90xAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Muzej isto\u010dne Bosne|page=20}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman period===\nWith the town coming under Ottoman rule, becoming less influenced by the Republic of Ragusa, the economic importance of Srebrenica went into decline, as did the proportion of Christians in the population. The [[Franciscan]] monastery was converted into a mosque, but the large number of Catholics, Ragusan and Saxon, caused the transformation of the town to Islam to be slower than in most of the other towns in the area.<ref>''A Short History of Bosnia'', S. 53 ff.</ref>\n\nThe area of [[Osat]] was liberated for a short time during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u201313), under the leadership of Kara-Marko Vasi\u0107 from [[Crvica, Srebrenica|Crvica]]. Upon the breakout of the uprising, Metropolitan Had\u017ei Melentije Stevanovi\u0107 contacted Vasi\u0107, who met with the rebel leadership. After participated in battles on the Drina (1804), Vasi\u0107 asked [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] for an army to liberate Osat; Lazar Mutap was dispatched and the region came under rebel rule. In 1808, the Ottomans cleared out Osat, and by 1813, the rebels left the region.\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the [[Second World War]] there were many atrocities committed by the [[Chetniks]] and Ustashas. Partisans fought [[Chetniks]] and [[Ustashe]] during the war and the people of Srebrenica built a partisan memorial cemetery monument for the fallen victims.\n\n===Bosnian War===\n{{main article|Srebrenica massacre|Bosnian genocide}}\nThe town of Srebrenica came to international prominence as a result of events during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992\u20131995). The strategic objectives proclaimed by the secessionist Bosnian Serb presidency included the creation of a border separating the Serb people from Bosnia's other ethnic communities and the abolition of the border along the River [[Drina]] separating Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs' Republika Srpska.<ref>http://www.icty.org/x/cases/tolimir/ind/en/tol-ii050210e.htm</ref> The Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak majority population of the Drina Valley posed a major obstacle to the achievement of these objectives. In the early days of the campaign of forcible transfer (ethnic cleansing) that followed the outbreak of war in April 1992 the town of Srebrenica was occupied by Serb/Serbian forces. It was subsequently retaken by Bosniak resistance groups. Refugees expelled from towns and villages across the central Drina valley sought shelter in Srebrenica, swelling the town's population.\n\nThe town and its surrounding area was surrounded and [[Siege of Srebrenica|besieged by Serb forces]]. On 16 April 1993, the [[United Nations]] declared the Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] a [[United Nations Safe Areas|UN safe area]], to be \"free from any armed attack or any other hostile act\", and guarded by a small Dutch unit operating under the mandate of [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR), which did nothing to defend the local population. \n\nSrebrenica and the other UN safe areas of [[\u017depa]] and [[Gora\u017ede]] were isolated pockets of Bosnian government-held territory in eastern Bosnia. In July 1995, despite the town's UN-protected status, it was attacked and captured by the [[Army of Republika Srpska]]. Following the town's capture, all men of fighting age who fell into Bosnian Serb hands were massacred in a systematically organised series of summary executions. The women of the town and men below 12 years of age and above 65 were transferred by bus to [[Tuzla]].\n\nThe [[Srebrenica massacre]] is considered the worst genocide in post-Second World War European history to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Srebrenica reburies 308 victims of massacre|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25639691|date=11 July 2008|work=NBC News|accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Srebrenica massacre was determined by judgement of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) to have been a crime of [[genocide]] (confirmed on appeal in 2004).<ref>{{cite web|title=Krstic \u2013 Judgement |url=https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|date=19 April 2004|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]|accessdate=11 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710085141/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|archivedate=10 July 2008}}</ref> This finding was upheld in 2007 by the [[International Court of Justice]].

In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Poto\u010dari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosnian Muslim settlements were routinely attacked as well. All this resulted in a great number of refugees and casualties.\"}}\n\n====British Army Documents Declassified in 2019====\n\nThe British National Archives in Kew released the documents dating back to July 1995 which deal with communication between British military and political actors during the Bosnian war. \n\nSeveral of the reports appear to blame the Bosniak Army (BiH) for provoking the Srebrenica attack. British intelligence doubted that Pale (Bosnian Serb headquarters) had any plans to overrun Srebrenica. Instead, the manoeuvre came as a response due to repeated Bosniak Army (BiH) attacks on BSA (Bosnian Serb Army) supply lines.\n\n{{quotation|The recent BSA (Bosnian Serb Army) attack on Srebrenica enclave was prompted by constant BiH (Bosniak Army) attacks over the previous 3 months on BSA supply route to the south of the enclave.
