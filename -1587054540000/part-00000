Eighty percent of the battle is communications.\" He championed a new program called Community Builders, created without appropriation by Congress, for 800 new HUD employees with computers to be paid as much as $100,000. In a June 16, 1999, speech, Cuomo declared that one purpose of the program was to fight against HUD's abolition. In August 1999, Community Builders distributed a letter to community groups to fight against proposed tax cuts. One HUD official declared that Community Builders were seen as \"Democratic [[ward heeler]]s who act as a pipeline between Democratic city officials, party leaders, and the administration and the [[Democratic National Committee]].\"\n\nIn 1998, Clinton-appointed HUD inspector general Susan Gaffney testified to a Senate committee that she was the victim of \"'escalating' attacks on her office by Cuomo and 'his key aides,' including cooked-up charges of racism, insubordination, malfeasance, and general dirty-dealing.\" In 1999, Gaffney's office concluded that \"most (15 out of 19) Community Builders' goals were activities rather than actual accomplishments.\" and that Cuomo's initiatives \"had a crippling effect on many of HUD's ongoing operations.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=James | last=Bovard | authorlink=James Bovard | year= 2000 | title= Feeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse Of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years | publisher= St. Martin's Press | location= New York | id=0-312-23082-6 | pages= 182\u2013184}}</ref>  Gaffney retired in May 2001, shortly after the department reached a $490,000 settlement with a black employee who had accused her of racial discrimination in passing him over for a promotion.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nakashima |first=Ellen |agency=''[[Washington Post]]'' |date=May 6, 2001 |title=HUD's Inspector General Retiring After Racial-Bias Suit Settlement |url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2001-05-06-0105060155-story.html |work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |location=Deerfield Beach, FL}}</ref>\n\nPrior to Cuomo's tenure, HUD was routinely included on the General Accounting Office's biannual watch list of government programs whose poor management made them prone to fraud.<ref name=\"Making\">{{cite news |last=Mahler |first=Jonathan |date=August 11, 2010 |title=The Making of Andrew Cuomo |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/magazine/15Cuomo-t.html |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |location=New York, NY |url-access=subscription |page=30}}</ref> During his time in office, two of HUD's four main departments were removed from the GAO list.<ref name=\"Making\"/> In addition, the department cut 15 percent of its staff as part of a Cuomo initiative to streamline its operations.<ref name=\"Making\"/>\n\n== 2002 New York gubernatorial election ==\n{{see also|2002 New York gubernatorial election}}\nCuomo first ran for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York in 2002.

NSBM artists typically combine neo-Nazi imagery and ideology with [[Modern Paganism#Ethnicity and region|ethnic European paganism]], [[Satanism]], or [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultism]], or a combination thereof, and vehemently oppose [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]. NSBM is not seen as a distinct genre, but as a [[neo-v\u00f6lkisch movements|neo-v\u00f6lkisch movement]] within black metal. According to [[Mattias Gardell]], NSBM musicians see this ideology as \"a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal\".<ref name=\"Gardell\">Mattias Gardell, [[Gods of the Blood|''Gods of the Blood'' (2003)]], p.307</ref>\n\nNSBM artists are not always explicit with their political beliefs in the music, instead expressing their beliefs offstage.<ref name=reichsrock>{{cite book|last1=Dyck|first1=Kirsten|title=Reichsrock: The International Web of White-Power and Neo-Nazi Hate Music|date=2016|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|location=New Brunswick|isbn=9780813574738|pages=58\u201361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sREVDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}</ref> Artists who hold [[Far-right politics|far-right]] or [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] beliefs but do not express these in their music are not often deemed NSBM by the greater black metal scene, but may be labelled as such by outside analysts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bifff-berlin.de/aktuell72.html |title=Rechtes Neuheiden-Festival mit Nazi-Runen im \"SO 36\" |publisher=BIFFF ...|language=de}}</ref> Some black metal bands have also made references to [[Nazi Germany]] purely for [[shock value]], much like some [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. While some black-metallers boycott NSBM artists, many are indifferent or appreciate the music without supporting the musicians.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=99}}\n\nThe emergence of NSBM coincided with the rise of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] in the early 1990s, particularly through the band [[Burzum]], whose sole member, [[Varg Vikernes]], developed his [[Satanism|Satanist]] beliefs and antagonism to Christianity into an increasingly white nationalist and neo-Nazi form of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]]. The German band [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] further developed the burgeoning scene with explicitly neo-Nazi lyrics and artistic themes. The movement became especially popular in Central and Eastern Europe, where it was developed by bands such as the Polish groups [[Graveland]] and [[Infernum]] and the Ukrainian band [[Hate Forest]]. The United States bands [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] also became involved in the by-now international NSBM movement. As the movement grew internationally, it started to overlap with existing [[White power music|white power musical forms]] such as [[Rock Against Communism]], [[Nazi punk|hatecore]], and the far-fight faction of [[Oi!]]. The Canadian neo-Nazi record label [[Resistance Records]] started releasing NSBM recordings, and even purchased Vikernes' label Cymophane Records. The associated United States political organization [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] white supremacist [[William Luther Pierce]] also became interested in the movement, and assisted Absurd frontman Hendrik M\u00f6bus when he fled to the United States to avoid arrest in Germany. In the early 2000s, bands such the Ukrainian [[Drudkh]] and [[Kroda]] and the Russian \u041c8\u041b8\u0422\u0425 continued the scene's popularity in Eastern Europe. In 2012, the NSBM [[Asgardsrei festival]] was established in [[Moscow]], Russia, and then in 2014 relocated to [[Kiev]], Ukraine, where it is closely linked to the activities of the [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalist]] network [[Azov Battalion]] and functions as an international hub for neo-Nazism and other far-right politics.\n\n==Black metal==\n{{Main|Black metal}}\nBlack metal is a style of [[extreme metal]] music that originated in the 1980s from the work of [[thrash metal]] bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]] (from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[England]]) \u2014 whose 1982 album ''[[Black Metal (Venom album)|Black Metal]]'' coined the term for the genre, [[Mercyful Fate]] (from [[Copenhagen]], Denmark), [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] (from [[V\u00e4llingby]], Sweden), [[Slayer]] (from [[Huntington Park, California]], United States), [[Hellhammer]] (from [[N\u00fcrensdorf]], Switzerland), [[Celtic Frost]] (from [[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland), and [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] (from [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany).<ref name=\"Stylus Magazine\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref>Moynihan & Soderlind, 2009, p. 10</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=Venkatesh|first=Vivek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwSXBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA368#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Educational, Psychological, and Behavioral Considerations in Niche Online Communities|last2=Podoshen|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Perri|first3=David|last4=Urbaniak|first4=Kathryn|date=2014-02-28|publisher=[[IGI Global]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4666-5207-1|editor-last=Venkatesh|editor-first=Vivek|location=Hershey|pages=368|language=en|chapter=21: From Pride and Prejudice to Shame: Multiple Facets of the Black Metal Scene within and without Online Environments|editor-last2=Wallin|editor-first2=Jason|editor-last3=Castro|editor-first3=Juan Carlos|editor-last4=Lewis|editor-first4=Jason Edward}}</ref> A lyrical focus that is anti-Christian, Satanist, [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]], or a combination thereof, is often considered a prerequisite for the genre, and originally the term \"black metal\" was synonymous with \"Satanic metal\".<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles.aspx?id=6-668|title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide|last=Kalis|first=Quentin|date=August 31, 2004|website=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Stan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avjCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q&f=false1|title=The Bloomsbury Handbook of Popular Music and Social Class|last2=Nielsen|first2=Nina|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=2020|isbn=9781501345388|editor-last=Peddie|editor-first=Ian|location=London|pages=193|chapter=Gaahl - Monster or Postmodern Prometheus?

NSBM artists typically combine neo-Nazi imagery and ideology with [[Modern Paganism#Ethnicity and region|ethnic European paganism]], [[Satanism]], or [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultism]], or a combination thereof, and vehemently oppose [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]. NSBM is not seen as a distinct genre, but as a [[neo-v\u00f6lkisch movements|neo-v\u00f6lkisch movement]] within black metal. According to [[Mattias Gardell]], NSBM musicians see this ideology as \"a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal\".<ref name=\"Gardell\">Mattias Gardell, [[Gods of the Blood|''Gods of the Blood'' (2003)]], p.307</ref>\n\nNSBM artists are not always explicit with their political beliefs in the music, instead expressing their beliefs offstage.<ref name=reichsrock>{{cite book|last1=Dyck|first1=Kirsten|title=Reichsrock: The International Web of White-Power and Neo-Nazi Hate Music|date=2016|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|location=New Brunswick|isbn=9780813574738|pages=58\u201361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sREVDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}</ref> Artists who hold [[Far-right politics|far-right]] or [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] beliefs but do not express these in their music are not often deemed NSBM by the greater black metal scene, but may be labelled as such by outside analysts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bifff-berlin.de/aktuell72.html |title=Rechtes Neuheiden-Festival mit Nazi-Runen im \"SO 36\" |publisher=BIFFF ...|language=de}}</ref> Some black metal bands have also made references to [[Nazi Germany]] purely for [[shock value]], much like some [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. While some black-metallers boycott NSBM artists, many are indifferent or appreciate the music without supporting the musicians.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=99}}\n\nThe emergence of NSBM coincided with the rise of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] in the early 1990s, particularly through the band [[Burzum]], whose sole member, [[Varg Vikernes]], developed his [[Satanism|Satanist]] beliefs and antagonism to Christianity into an increasingly white nationalist and neo-Nazi form of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]]. The German band [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] further developed the burgeoning scene with explicitly neo-Nazi lyrics and artistic themes. The movement became especially popular in Central and Eastern Europe, where it was developed by bands such as the Polish groups [[Graveland]] and [[Infernum]] and the Ukrainian band [[Hate Forest]]. The United States bands [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] also became involved in the by-now international NSBM movement. As the movement grew internationally, it started to overlap with existing [[White power music|white power musical forms]] such as [[Rock Against Communism]], [[Nazi punk|hatecore]], and the far-fight faction of [[Oi!]]. The Canadian neo-Nazi record label [[Resistance Records]] started releasing NSBM recordings, and even purchased Vikernes' label Cymophane Records. The associated United States political organization [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] white supremacist [[William Luther Pierce]] also became interested in the movement, and assisted Absurd frontman Hendrik M\u00f6bus when he fled to the United States to avoid arrest in Germany. In the early 2000s, bands such the Ukrainian [[Drudkh]] and [[Kroda]] and the Russian \u041c8\u041b8\u0422\u0425 continued the scene's popularity in Eastern Europe. In 2012, the NSBM [[Asgardsrei festival]] was established in [[Moscow]], Russia, and then in 2014 relocated to [[Kiev]], Ukraine, where it is closely linked to the activities of the [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalist]] network [[Azov Battalion]] and functions as an international hub for neo-Nazism and other far-right politics.\n\n==Black metal==\n{{Main|Black metal}}\nBlack metal is a style of [[extreme metal]] music that originated in the 1980s from the work of [[thrash metal]] bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]] (from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[England]]) \u2014 whose 1982 album ''[[Black Metal (Venom album)|Black Metal]]'' coined the term for the genre, [[Mercyful Fate]] (from [[Copenhagen]], Denmark), [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] (from [[V\u00e4llingby]], Sweden), [[Slayer]] (from [[Huntington Park, California]], United States), [[Hellhammer]] (from [[N\u00fcrensdorf]], Switzerland), [[Celtic Frost]] (from [[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland), and [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] (from [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany).<ref name=\"Stylus Magazine\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref>Moynihan & Soderlind, 2009, p. 10</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=Venkatesh|first=Vivek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwSXBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA368#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Educational, Psychological, and Behavioral Considerations in Niche Online Communities|last2=Podoshen|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Perri|first3=David|last4=Urbaniak|first4=Kathryn|date=2014-02-28|publisher=[[IGI Global]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4666-5207-1|editor-last=Venkatesh|editor-first=Vivek|location=Hershey|pages=368|language=en|chapter=21: From Pride and Prejudice to Shame: Multiple Facets of the Black Metal Scene within and without Online Environments|editor-last2=Wallin|editor-first2=Jason|editor-last3=Castro|editor-first3=Juan Carlos|editor-last4=Lewis|editor-first4=Jason Edward}}</ref> A lyrical focus that is anti-Christian, Satanist, [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]], or a combination thereof, is often considered a prerequisite for the genre, and originally the term \"black metal\" was synonymous with \"Satanic metal\".<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles.aspx?id=6-668|title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide|last=Kalis|first=Quentin|date=August 31, 2004|website=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Stan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avjCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q&f=false1|title=The Bloomsbury Handbook of Popular Music and Social Class|last2=Nielsen|first2=Nina|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=2020|isbn=9781501345388|editor-last=Peddie|editor-first=Ian|location=London|pages=193|chapter=Gaahl - Monster or Postmodern Prometheus?

The word ''pysanka'' comes from the verb ''pysaty'', \"to write\" or \"to [[inscribe]]\", as the designs are not paintedhl on, but written (inscribed) with [[beeswax]].\n\nMany other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups decorate eggs using wax resist for [[Easter]]. These include the [[Belarusians]] (\u043f\u0456\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430, ''pisanka''), [[Bulgarians]] (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043e \u044f\u0439\u0446\u0435, ''pisano yaytse''), [[Rusyns|Carpatho-Rusyns]] ( \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u044b, ''pysank\u0177''), [[Croats]] (''[[Croatian pisanica|pisanica]]''), [[Czechs]] (''kraslice''), [[Hungarians]] (''h\u00edmestoj\u00e1s''), [[Lithuanians]] (''margutis''), [[Poles]] (''[[Polish pisanka|pisanka]]''), [[Romanians]] (''ou\u0103 vopsite'', ''\u00eencondeiate'' or ''\u00eempistrite''), [[Serbs]] (''pisanica''), [[Slovaks]] (''kraslica''), [[Slovenes]] (''pirhi'', ''pisanice,'' or ''remenke'') and [[Sorbs]] (''jejka pisa\u0107'').\n\n[[File:Pysanky2011.JPG|thumb|400px|A mix of modern, diasporan and traditional Ukrainian pysanky]]\n\n== Types of decorated Ukrainian eggs ==\n''Pysanka'' is often taken to mean any type of decorated egg, but it specifically refers to an egg created by the written-wax batik method and utilizing traditional folk motifs and designs.  Several other types of decorated eggs are seen in Ukrainian tradition, and these vary throughout the [[Ukrainian historical regions|regions of Ukraine]].\n* ''Krashanky'' \u2013from ''krasyty'' (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0438), \"to decorate\"\u2013 are boiled eggs [[dyed]] a single color (with vegetable dyes, traditionally onion skin), and are blessed and eaten at Easter.\n* ''Pysanky'' \u2013from ''pysaty'' (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to write\"\u2013 are raw eggs created with the wax-resist method ([[Resist dyeing]]). The designs are \"written\" in hot wax with a pinhead or a special [[stylus]] called a ''pysachok'' (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0447\u043e\u043a) or a ''kistka'' (\u043a\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0430) which has a small funnel attached to hold a small amount of liquid wax. The word that is used to describe the egg actually comes from the Ukrainian verb ''pysaty'', which means \"to write\".  Wooden eggs and beaded eggs are often referred to as \"pysanky\" because they mimic the decorative style of pysanky in a different medium.\n* ''Krapanky'' \u2013from ''krapka'' (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430), \"a dot\"\u2013 are raw eggs decorated using the wax-resist method, but with only dots as ornamentation (no symbols or other drawings). They are traditionally created by dripping molten wax from a beeswax candle onto an egg. They can be considered the simplest version of a pysanka, or a \"proto-pysanka.\"\n* ''Dryapanky'' \u2013from ''dryapaty'' (\u0434\u0440\u044f\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to scratch\"\u2013 are created by scratching the surface of a dyed egg to reveal the white [[animal shell|shell]] below.\n* ''Malyovanky'' \u2013from ''malyuvaty'' (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to paint\"\u2013 are created by [[painting]] a design with a brush using oil or water color paints.  It is sometimes used to refer to coloring (e.g. with a marker) on an egg.\n* ''Nakleyanky'' \u2013from ''kleyaty'' (\u043a\u043b\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0438), \"to glue on\"\u2013 are created by glueing objects to the surface of an egg.\n* ''Travlenky'' \u2013from ''travlenya'' (\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f), \u201cetching\u201d \u2013 are created by waxing eggs and then etching away the unwaxed areas.  This is not a traditional Ukraine practice, but has become popularized recently.\n* ''Biserky'' \u2013from ''biser'' (\u0431\u0456\u0441\u0435\u0440), \"beads\"\u2013 are created by coating an egg with beeswax, and then embedding beads into the wax to create geometric designs.\n* ''Lystovky'' \u2013from ''lystya'' (\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044f), \"leaves\"\u2013 are created by dyeing an egg to which small leaves have been attached.\nAll but the krashanky and lystovky are usually meant to be decorative (as opposed to edible), and the egg yolk and white are either allowed to dry up over time, or (in modern times) removed by blowing them out through a small hole in the egg.\n\nIn recent years, new forms of egg decoration have been brought from abroad and become popularized in Ukraine.  These include:\n\n* ''Rizblenky'' \u2013from ''rizbyty'' (\u0440\u0456\u0437\u044c\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438), \"to cut, to carve\"\u2013 are created by drilling the surface of an egg to create cut out areas.\n* ''Linyvky'' \u2013from ''linyvyi'' (\u043b\u0456\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0439), \"lazy\"\u2013 a joking term to describe eggs decorated using stickers or shrink-wrap sleeves.\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n[[Image:pysanka.jpg|thumb|right|The world's largest pysanka was erected in [[Vegreville]], [[Alberta]] in 1974, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].  ]]\n\nAccording to many scholars, the art of wax-resist (batik) egg decoration in Slavic cultures probably dates back to the pre-Christian era.

Humans could not catch the birds, but they did manage to obtain the eggs the birds laid. Thus, the eggs were magical objects, a source of life.  The egg was also honored during rite-of-Spring festivals&ndash;&ndash;it represented the rebirth of the earth. The long, hard winter was over; the earth burst forth and was reborn just as the egg miraculously burst forth with life. The egg therefore, was believed to have special powers.<ref>Manko, Vira.

These eggs were ornamented, and in the form of \u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0456 (torokhkal'tsi; rattles containing a small stone with which to scare evil spirits away).<ref>\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u041c.\u0410. \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u043f\u0438\u0441   \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u0417\u043d\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f-\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u00bb,  2008</ref>\n\nSimilarly, no actual pysanky from the [[Kievan Rus']] period exist, but stone, clay and bone versions do, and have been excavated in many sites throughout Ukraine. Most common are ceramic eggs decorated with a horsetail plant (\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0430 ''sosonka'') pattern in yellow and bright green against a dark background. More than 70 such eggs have been excavated throughout Ukraine, many of them from graves of children and adults. They are thought to be representations of real decorated eggs.\n\nThese ceramic eggs were common in Kievan Rus', and had a characteristic style.  They were slightly smaller than life size (2.5 by 4&nbsp;cm, or 1 by 1.6&nbsp;inches), and were created from reddish pink clays by the spiral method.  The majolica glazed eggs had a brown, green or yellow background, and showed interwoven yellow and green stripes. The eggs made in large cities like [[Kiev]] and [[Chernihiv]], which had workshops that produced clay tile and bricks; these tiles (and pysanky) were not only used locally, but were exported to Poland, and to several Scandinavian and Baltic countries.<ref>Tkachuk, Mary et al.

The pysanka was written on a goose egg, which was discovered largely intact, and the design is that of a wave pattern. The second oldest known pysanka was excavated in [[Baturyn]] in 2008, and dates to the end of the 17th century.  Baturyn was Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa|Mazepa]]'s capital, and it was razed in 1708 by the armies of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]].  A complete (but crushed) pysanka was discovered, a chicken egg shell with geometric designs against a blue-gray background.<ref>\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0447\u0443\u043a \u041d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0456\u044f.  \u0423\u041a\u0420\u0406\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c 23-07-2008</ref> The pysanka is currently being reconstructed; when completed, it will allow us to see what sort of ornamentation was in use in pre-1708 Ukraine.\n\n== Legends ==\n\nThe [[Hutsuls]]&ndash;&ndash;a group of Rusyns who live in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] around western Ukraine&ndash;&ndash;believe that the fate of the world depends upon the pysanka. As long as the egg writing custom continues, the world will exist. If, for any reason,  this custom is abandoned, evil&ndash;&ndash;in the shape of a horrible serpent who is forever chained to a cliff&ndash;&ndash; will overrun the world. Each year the serpent sends out his minions to see how many pysanky have been written. If the number is low the serpent's chains are loosened and he is free to wander the earth causing havoc and destruction. If, on the other hand, the number of pysanky has increased, the chains are tightened and good triumphs over evil for yet another year.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People) \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb, 1993</ref> \n \nNewer legends blended folklore and Christian beliefs and firmly attached the egg to the Easter celebration. One legend concerns the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. It tells of the time Mary gave eggs to the soldiers at the cross. She entreated them to be less cruel to her son and she wept. The tears of Mary fell upon the eggs, spotting them with dots of brilliant color.\n\nAnother legend tells of when [[Mary Magdalene]] went to the sepulchre to anoint the body of Jesus. She had with her a basket of eggs to serve as a repast. When she arrived at the sepulchre and uncovered the eggs, the pure white shells had miraculously taken on a rainbow of colors.\n\nA common legend tells of Simon the peddler, who helped Jesus carry his cross on the way to Calvary.  He had left his goods at the side of the road, and, when he returned, the eggs had all turned into intricately decorated pysanky.\n\n== Superstitions and folk beliefs ==\n\nMany superstitions were attached to pysanky.  Pysanky were thought to protect households from evil spirits, catastrophe, lightning and fires.  Pysanky with spiral motifs were the most powerful, as the demons and other unholy creatures would be trapped within the spirals forever. A blessed pysanka could be used to find demons hidden in the dark corners of your house.\n \nPysanky held powerful magic, and had to be disposed of properly, lest a witch get a hold of one.  She could use the shell to gather dew, and use the gathered dew to dry up a cow's milk.  The witch could also use bits of the eggshell to poke people and sicken them.  The eggshell had to be ground up very finely (and fed to chickens to make them good egg layers) or broken into pieces and tossed into a running stream.\n\nThe cloth used to dry pysanky was powerful, too, and could be used to cure skin diseases. And it was considered very bad luck to trample on a pysanka\u2014God would punish anyone who did with a variety of illnesses.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People)  \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb,  1993</ref>\n\nThere were superstitions regarding the colors and designs on the pysanky. One old Ukrainian myth centered on the wisdom of giving older people gifts of pysanky with darker colors and/or rich designs, for their life has already been filled.  Similarly, it is appropriate to give young people pysanky with white as the predominant color because their life is still a blank page. Girls would often give pysanky to young men they fancied, and include heart motifs.  It was said, though, that a girl should never give her boyfriend a pysanky that has no design on the top and bottom of the egg, as this might signify that the boyfriend would soon lose his hair.\n\n== Writing pysanky ==\n[[File:Unfinished pysanka.jpg|thumb|An unfinished pysanka ready for the black bath of dye. It bears the Ukrainian Easter greeting: \"Christ is risen!\"]]\n[[File:UkieStyluses.jpg|thumb|A variety of [[canting|styluses]], from traditional to modern]]\n\nEach region, each village, and almost every family in Ukraine had its own special ritual, its own symbols, meanings and secret formulas for dyeing eggs.  These customs were preserved faithfully and passed down from mother to daughter through generations.  The custom of decorating pysanky was observed with greatest care, and a pysanka, after receiving the Easter blessing, was held to have great powers as a talisman.\n\nPysanky were traditionally made during the last week of Lent, Holy Week in the Orthodox and Greek ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate]]) Catholic calendars. (Both faiths are represented in Ukraine, and both still celebrate Easter by the [[Julian calendar]].) They were made by the women of the family.  During the middle of the Lenten season, women began putting aside eggs, those that were most perfectly shaped and smooth, and ideally, the first laid eggs of young hens. There had to be a rooster, as only fertilized eggs could be used.  (If non-fertile eggs were used, there would be no fertility in the home.)\n\nThe dyes were prepared from dried plants, roots, bark, berries and insects ([[Polish cochineal|cochineal]]).  Yellow was obtained from the flowers of the [[Genista tinctoria|woadwaxen]], and gold from onion skins.  Red could be extracted from [[Haematoxylum campechianum|logwood]] or cochineal, and dark green and violet from the husks of sunflower seeds and the berries and bark of the elderberry bush.  Black dye was made from walnut husks.  The dyes were prepared in secret, using recipes handed down from mother to daughter.  Sometimes chemical dyes (of unusual or difficult colors) were purchased from peddlers along with [[alum]], a [[mordant]] that helped the [[natural dye]]s adhere better to eggshells.\n\nA [[canting|stylus]], known as a pysachok, pysak, pysal'tse, or kystka (kistka), depending on region, was prepared. A piece of thin brass was wrapped around a needle, forming a hollow cone.  This was attached to a small stick (willow was preferred) with wire or horsehair.  In the Lemko regions a simple pin or nail inserted onto the end of a stick was used instead (drop-pull technique).\n\nThe pysanky were made at night, when the children were asleep.  The women in the family gathered together, said the appropriate prayers, and went to work.  It was done in secret&ndash;&ndash;the patterns and color combinations were handed down from mother to daughter and carefully guarded.\n\nPysanky were made using a wax resist (batik) method. [[Beeswax]] was heated in a small bowl on the large family stove (\u043f\u0456\u0447), and the styluses were dipped into it.  The molten wax was applied to the white egg with a writing motion; any bit of shell covered with wax would be sealed, and remain white.  Then the egg was dyed yellow, and more wax applied, and then orange, red, purple, black.  (The dye sequence was always light to dark).  Bits of shell covered with wax remained that color.  After the final color, usually red, brown or black, the wax was removed by heating the egg in the stove and gently wiping off the melted wax, or by briefly dipping the egg into boiling water.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HR6mT6nEIsb5ggf8ovSZAQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgy#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Where Easter Eggs Rival The Rainbow.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1944, pp. 88-89.</ref>\n\nBoiled eggs were not used, as pysanky were generally written on raw or, less commonly, baked eggs (pecharky).  Boiled eggs were [[red Easter eggs|dyed red for Easter]], using an onion skin dye, and called \"krashanky\".  The number of colors on an egg was usually limited, as natural dyes had very long dyeing times, sometimes hours.  Pysanky would be written\u2013and dyed\u2013in batches.\n\nAlternatively, in ethnic Lemko and Boiko areas, as well as Nadsiannia, the drop pull method was also utilized. A pinhead was dipped into molten wax and then applied to the shell of the egg. Simple drops were made, or there was an additional pulling motion, which would create teardrop or comma shapes. These drops were used to create patterns and designs.  Dyeing and wax removal proceeded as with traditional pysanky.\n\nPysanky continue to be made in modern times; while many traditional aspects have been preserved, new technologies are in evidence.  Aniline dyes have largely replaced natural dyes.  Styluses are now made with modern materials.  Traditional styluses are still made from brass and wood, but those made with more modern plastic handles are gaining in popularity. An electric version of the stylus has been commercially available since the 1970s, with the cone becoming a metal reservoir which keeps the melted beeswax at a constant temperature and holds a much larger amount than a traditional stylus.  These newer styluses (whether electric or not) also sport machined heads, with sizes or the opening ranging from extra-extra-fine to extra-heavy.\n\n== Sharing pysanky ==\n[[File:EasterInLvov2.jpg|thumb|[[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[priest]] blessing Easter baskets in [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]]]\nPysanky are typically made to be given to family members and respected outsiders. To give a pysanka is to give a symbolic gift of life, which is why the egg must remain whole. Furthermore, the design, a combination of the motifs and colors on a traditional folk pysanka, has a deep, symbolic meaning. Traditionally, a pysanka given with its symbolic meaning in mind, be it wishes of protection, fecundity, or love. Typically, pysanky were displayed prominently in a public room of the house.\n\nIn a large family, by Holy Thursday, 60 or more eggs would have been completed by the women of the house. (The more daughters a family had, the more pysanky would be produced.) The eggs would then be taken to the church on Easter Sunday to be blessed, after which they were given away. Here is a partial list of how the pysanky would be used:\n\n# One or two would be given to the priest.\n# Three or four were taken to the cemetery and placed on graves of the family.\n# Ten or twenty were given to children or godchildren.\n# Ten or twelve were exchanged by the unmarried girls with the eligible men in the community.\n# Several were saved to place in the coffin of loved ones who might die during the year.\n# Several were saved to keep in the home for protection from fire, lightning and storms.\n# Two or three were placed in the mangers of cows and horses to ensure safe calving and colting and a good milk supply for the young.\n# At least one egg was placed beneath the bee hive to ensure good production of honey.\n# One was saved for each grazing animal to be taken out to the fields with the shepherds in the spring.\n# Several pysanky were placed in the nests of hens to encourage the laying of eggs.\n\nEveryone from the youngest to the oldest received a pysanka for Easter.  Young people were given pysanky with bright designs; dark pysanky were given to older people.\n\nA bowl full of pysanky was invariably kept in every home.  It served not only as a colorful display, but also as protection from all dangers.  Some of the eggs were emptied, and a bird\u2019s head made of wax or dough and wings and tail-feathers of folded paper were attached.  These \u201cdoves\u201d were suspended before icons in commemoration of the birth of Christ, when a dove came down from heaven and soared over the child Jesus.\n\n== Symbolism in pysanky ==\n[[File:A basket full of Hutsul pysanky.JPG|thumb|200px|A basket full of Hutsul pysanky]]\n\nA great variety of ornamental motifs are found on pysanky.  Because of the egg\u2019s fragility, few ancient examples of pysanky have survived.  However, similar design motifs occur in pottery, woodwork, metalwork, [[Ukrainian embroidery]] and other folk arts,<ref>Selivachov, Mykhailo. Folk Designs of Ukraine Doncaster, Australia: Bayda Books, 1995</ref> many of which have survived.\n\nThe symbols which decorated pysanky underwent a process of adaptation over time. In pre-Christian times these symbols imbued an egg with magical powers to ward off evil spirits, banish winter, guarantee a good harvest and bring a person good luck. After 988, when Christianity became the state religion of Ukraine, the interpretation of many of the symbols began to change, and the pagan motifs were reinterpreted in a Christian light.\n\nSince the mid-19th century, pysanky have been created more for decorative reasons than for the purposes of magic, especially among the Diaspora, as belief in most such rituals and practices has fallen by the wayside in a more modern, scientific era.  Additionally, the Ukrainian diaspora has reinterpreted meanings and created their own new symbols and interpretations of older ones.<ref>\nLesiv, Mariya . [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/folklorica/article/view/3782/3620 From Ritual Object To Art Form: The Ukrainian Easter Egg Pysanka In Its Canadian Context]. Folklorica, Journal of the Slavic and East European Folkore Association. Vol 12 (2007)</ref>\n\nThe names and meaning of various symbols and design elements vary from region to region, and even from village to village.  Similar symbols can have totally different interpretations in different places. There are several thousand different motifs in Ukrainian folk designs.  They can be grouped into several families. Keep in mind that these talismanic meanings applied to traditional folk pysanky with traditional designs, not to modern original creations.\n\n=== Geometric ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Polissia.svg|120px|thumbnail|Sorokoklyn from [[Polissia]]]]\nThe most popular pysanka designs are geometric figures. The egg itself is most often divided by straight lines into squares, triangles and other shapes. These shapes are then filled with other forms and designs. These are also among the most ancient symbols, with the \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0442\u043e (resheto, sieve) motif dating back to Paleolithic times. Other ancient geometric symbols are agricultural in nature: triangles, which symbolized clouds or rain; quadrilaterals, especially those with a resheto design in them, symbolized a ploughed field; dots stood for seeds.\n\nGeometric symbols used quite commonly on pysanky today.  The triangle is said to symbolize the Holy Trinity; in ancient times it symbolized other trinities: the elements of air, fire and water, the family (man, woman and child) or the cycle of life (birth, life, and death).  Diamonds, a type of quadrilateral, are sometimes said to symbolize knowledge. Curls/spirals are ancient symbols of the Zmiya/Serpent, and are said to have a meaning of defense or protection. The spiral is said to be protective against the \"\u043d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430\";  an evil spirit which happens to enter a house will be drawn into the spiral and trapped there. Dots, which can represent seeds, stars or cuckoo birds\u2019 eggs (a symbol of spring), are popularly said to be the tears of the blessed Virgin. Hearts are also sometimes seen, and, as in other cultures, they represent love.\n[[File:Meander Motif on a Ukrainian Pysanka.JPG|thumb|200px|A meander motif on a traditional pysanka]]\nOne interesting adaptation of the geometric design is not a symbol per se but a division of the egg called \"forty triangles\" (actually 48) or \"Sorokoklyn (forty wedges).\" Its ancient meaning is not known, but is often said to represent the forty days of lent, the forty martyrs, the forty days that Christ spent in the desert, or the forty life tasks of married couples.\n\n==== Eternity bands ====\nEternity bands or meanders are composed of waves, lines or ribbons; such a line is called a \"bezkonechnyk.\"  A line without end is said to represent immortality.  Waves, however, are a water symbol, and thus a symbol of the Zmiya/Serpent, the ancient water god.  Waves are therefore considered an agricultural symbol, because it is rain that ensures good crops.\n\n===Berehynia===\n[[File:Berehynia Pysanka.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a berehynia motif]]\nThe goddess motif is an ancient one, and most commonly found in pysanky from Polissia or Western Podillia. The berehynia was believed to be the source of life and death. On the one hand, she is a life giving mother, the creator of heaven and all living things, and the mistress of heavenly water (rain), upon which the world relies for fertility and fruitfulness. On the other hand, she was the merciless controller of destinies.\n\nThe goddess is sometimes depicted with arms upraised, and the arms vary in number but are always in pairs: 2, 4 or 6. This is similar to the appearance of the Christian Oranta. Pysanky with this motif were called \u201cbohyn\u2019ky\u201d (\u0431\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438, little goddesses) or \u201czhuchky\u201d (\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0438, beetles), the latter because they are similar in appearance to the Cyrillic letter \u0416 (zh).  Sometimes the berehynia has become abstracted, and is represented by a plant\u2014vazon\u2014the tree of life. Her arms become the branches and flowers, and she is firmly rooted in a flowerpot.\n\nThe most common depiction of the great goddess is a composition containing \u201ckucheri\u201d (curls). The berehynia may be seen perched on a curl, or a curl may be given wings; the symbol may be doubled, end-to-end. There is usually a crown on the berehynia\u2019s head. These compositions are given the folk names of \u201cqueen,\u201d \u201cprincess,\u201d \"rooster,\" \u201cscythe,\u201d \u201cdrake,\u201d or simply \u201cwings.\"\n\n=== Christian symbols ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Church Motif.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a church motif]]\nThe only true traditional Christian symbol, and not one adapted from an earlier pagan one, is the church. Stylized churches are often found on pysanky from Hutsul regions (including parts of Bukovyna). Church parts are usually in threes: three stories/roofs, three towers, three openings (windows, doors). Sometimes only the bell tower (dzvinytsia) is depicted.\n\nCrosses are fairly common, although most of those found on traditional pysanky are not Ukrainian (Byzantine) crosses. The crosses most commonly depicted are of the simple \"Greek\" cross type, with arms of equal lengths. This type of cross predates Christianity, and is a sun symbol (an abstracted representation of the solar bird); it is sometimes combined with the star (ruzha) motif. The \"cross crosslet\" type of cross, one in which the ends of each arm are crossed, is frequently seen, particularly on Hutsul and Bukovynian pysanky.\n\nOther adapted religious symbols include a triangle with a circle in the center, denoting the eye of God, and one known as the \"hand of god.\"\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the commercially produced folk pysanky of the Carpathians, especially [[Kosmach]], have begun displaying more Christian symbols.  The lower arm of the cross in older designs is often lengthened to appear more Christian, even if it throws off the symmetry of the design. [[Crucifix]]es are sometimes seen. Pysanky are being written with depictions of Easter baskets on them, including a [[Paska (bread)|paska]] and candle. [[Doves as symbols|White doves]], symbols of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]], are also more frequently seen; doves are usually depicted in flight, while other wild birds are traditionally shown perched.\n\n=== Phytomorphic (plant) motifs ===\n\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Priashivshchyna 01.svg|thumbnail|150px|Floral ornaments from [[Lemkivshchyna]]]]\nThe most common motifs found on pysanky are those associated with plants and their parts (flowers and fruit). Women who wrote pysanky drew their inspiration from the world of nature, depicting flowers, trees, fruits, leaves and whole plants in a highly stylized (not realistic) fashion. Such ornaments symbolized the rebirth of nature after winter, and pysanky were written with plant motifs to guarantee a good harvest. A most popular floral design is a plant in a vase of standing on its own, which symbolized the tree of life and was a highly abstracted version of the berehynia (great goddess).\n\nPysanky created by the [[mountain people]] of the Hutsul region of Ukraine often showed a stylized fir tree branch, a symbol of youth and eternal life. Trees, in general, symbolized strength, renewal, creation, growth; as with animal motifs, the parts (leaves, branches) had the same symbolic meaning as the whole.  The oak tree was a sacred to the ancient god Perun, the most powerful of the pagan Slavic pantheon, and thus oak leaves symbolized strength.\n\nPussy willow branches are sometimes depicted on pysanky; in Ukraine, the pussy willow replaces the palm leaf on Palm Sunday.  This is not a common motif, though, and may be a more recent addition.\n\nTwo very popular plant motifs on modern diasporan pysanky are poppies and wheat; these motifs are never seen on traditional pysanky, and are purely a modern invention.\n\n==== Flowers ====\n[[File:Ruzha (Ukrainian Pysanka).JPG|thumb|200px|A Ukrainian pysanka with a ruzha (eight pointed star) motif]]\nFlowers are a common pysanka motif. They can be divided into two types: specific botanical types, and non-specific.\n\nSpecific botanical types include sunflowers, daisies, violets, carnations, periwinkle and lily-of the-valley. These flowers are represented with identifying features that make them recognizable. Carnations will have a serrated edge to the petals, the flowers of the lily of the valley will be arrayed along a stem, periwinkle will have three or four leaves (periwinkle is represented by its leaves, not its flowers, on pysanky).\n\nThere are also flower motifs called orchids and tulips, but these are not botanical names.  They are actually the names given to fantastical flowers, as neither of these flowers was commonly found in Ukraine until modern times. The names reflected the exoticism of the designs.\n[[File:Vazon (Tree of Life).JPG|thumb|150px|Traditional Ukrainian pysanka from Bukovyna region, with a vazon motif]]\nNon-specific flowers are much more common, and consist of the ruzha and others. The ruzha (or rozha) is named after the mallow flower, although it does not resemble one, and is another name given to the eight-pointed star motif.  A ruzha can be full, empty, compound, divided or even crooked. It is a sun sign. Other non-specific types often have hyphenated names: potato-flower, strawberry-flower, etc.  They are usually simple arrangements of petals, six or more, and bear little resemblance to the plant they are named for.\n\n====Vazon/Tree of Life====\nThe \u201ctree of life\u201d motif is widely used in traditional pysanky designs. It can be represented in many ways. Sometimes it appears as two deer on either side of a pine tree. More often it manifests as a flower pot (\u201cvazon\u201d), filled with leaves and flowers.  The pot itself is usually a rectangle, triangle or a rhomboid (symbolic of the earth), and is covered with dots (seeds) and dashes (water). Many branches grow out of it, in a symmetric fashion, with leaves and flowers. This plant is a berehynia (goddess) symbol, with the branches representing the many arms of the mother goddess.\n\n==== Fruit ====\nFruit is not a common motif on pysanky, but is sometimes represented. Apples, plums and cherries are depicted on traditional pysanky. Currants and viburnum (kalyna) berries are sometimes seen, too. These motifs are probably related to fecundity. Grapes are seen more often, as they have been transformed from an agricultural motif to a religious one, representing the Holy Communion.\n\n=== Scevomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Rake Motifs.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with rake motifs]]\nScevomorphic designs are the second-largest group of designs, and are representations of man-made agricultural objects. These symbols are very common, as Ukraine was a highly agricultural society, and drew many of its positive images from field and farm. Some of these symbols are actually related to agriculture; others have older meanings, but were renamed in more recent times based on their appearance.\n\nCommon symbols include the ladder (symbolizing [[prayer]]s going up to heaven) and the sieve/resheto (a plowed field, or perhaps the separation of good and evil).\n\nRakes and combs are often depicted; both are meant to invoke a good harvest. Both are rain symbols. The body of the rake (sometimes depicted as a triangle) is the cloud, and the teeth symbolize rain drops. (Note: these combs are not hair combs, but agricultural implements.)\n\nWindmills, a variation on the broken cross (swastika) motif, are actually sun symbols, not agricultural symbols. The movement of the cross echoes the movement of the sun across the sky.\n\n=== Zoomorphic (animal) motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky -- Teeth of wolf from Odessa.svg|thumbnail|150px|Wolf's teeth [[Odessa]]]]\nAlthough animal motifs are not as popular as plant motifs, they are nevertheless found on pysanky, especially those of the people of the Carpathian Mountains. Animal depicted on pysanky include both wild animals (deer, birds, fish) and domesticated ones (rams, horses, poultry).  As with plants, animals were depicted in the abstract, highly stylized, and not with realistic detail.\n\nHorses were popular ornaments because they symbolized strength and endurance, as well as wealth and prosperity. They also had a second meaning as a sun symbol: in some versions of pagan mythology, the sun was drawn across the sky by the steeds of Dazhboh, the sun god. Similarly, deer designs were fairly common as they were intended to bring prosperity and long life; in other versions of the myth, it was the stag who carried the sun across the sky on his antlers.  Rams are symbols of leadership, strength, dignity, and perseverance.\n\nSometime women simply drew parts of animals; these symbols were probably a sort of shorthand, endowed with all the attributes of the animal represented. Ducks\u2019 necks, goose feet, rabbits\u2019 ears, rams\u2019 horns, wolves\u2019 teeth, bear claws, and bulls\u2019 eyes can all be found on pysanky.  One cannot be sure, however, if these symbols were actually meant to represent animals, or were renamed centuries later because of their appearance.\n\n==== Birds ====\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Birds.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with bird motifs]]\nBirds were considered the harbingers of spring, thus they were a commonplace pysanka motif.  Birds of all kinds are the messengers of the sun and heaven. Birds are always shown perched, at rest, never flying (except for swallows and, in more recent times, white doves carrying letters). Roosters are symbols of masculinity, or the coming of dawn, and hens represent fertility.\n\nBirds were almost always shown in full profile, stylized, but with characteristic features of the species. Partial representations of some birds&ndash;&ndash;mostly domestic fowl&ndash;&ndash;are often seen on pysanky. Bird parts (eyes, feet, beaks, combs, feathers) are said carry the same meaning as the entire bird. Thus hen's feet represent fertility and the rooster's comb signifies masculinity.\n\n==== Insects ====\nInsects are only rarely depicted on pysanky. Highly stylized spiders (and occasionally their webs) are the most common on folk pysanky, and symbolize perseverance. Beetles are sometimes seen, but rarely look anything like a beetle. What they do resemble, somewhat, is the letter \u0416, as in their Ukrainian name \"\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043e\u043a.\" Other insects are sometimes seen on modern, diasporan pysanky, most commonly butterflies and bees, but seem to be a modern innovation.  In Onyshchuk's \"Symbolism of the Ukrainian Pysanka\" she depicts pysanky with a butterfly motif, but the original design, recorded by Kulzhynsky in 1899, was labeled as being swallows' tails.\n\n==== Fish ====\n[[File:Spirals Zmiya.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with spirals]]\nThe fish, originally a symbol of health, eventually came to symbolize Jesus Christ, the \"fisher of men.\"  In old Ukrainian fairy tales, the fish often helped the hero to win his fight with evil. In the Greek alphabet \u201cfish\u201d ([[ichthys]]) is an [[acrostic]] of \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior,\u201d and it became a secret symbol used by the early Christians.  The fish represents abundance, as well as Christian interpretations of baptism, sacrifice, the powers of regeneration, and Christ himself.\n\n==== Serpent ====\n\nAnother ancient symbol is that of the \u0437\u043c\u0456\u044f or serpent, the ancient god of water and earth.  The serpent could be depicted in several ways: as an \"S\" or sigma, as a curl or spiral, or as a wave. When depicted as a sigma, the zmiya often wears a crown. Depictions of the serpent can be found on Neolithic Trypillian pottery. The serpent symbol on a ''pysanka'' is said to bring protection from catastrophe.  Spirals were particularly strong talismans, as an evil spirit, upon entering the house, would be drawn into the spiral and trapped there.\n\n=== Cosmomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Pysanka with Swastika motif.jpg|thumb|150px|Traditional pysanka with a swastika (svarha) motif]]\nAmong the oldest and most important symbols of pysanky is the sun, and the simplest rendering of the sun is a closed circle with or without rays. Pysanky from all regions of Ukraine depict an eight-sided star, the most common depiction of the sun; this symbol is also called a \"ruzha.\"  Six- or seven-sided stars can also be seen, but much less commonly.\n\nThe sun can also appear as a flower or a \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442 (three leaf). The [[swastika]], called in Ukrainian a \"svarha,\" is sometimes referred to as a \"broken cross\" or \"ducks\u2019 necks.\" It represented the sun in pagan times: the movement of the arms around the cross represented the movement of the sun across the sky. The Slavic pagans also believed that the sun did not rise on its own, but was carried across the sky by a stag (or, in some versions, a horse).  The deer and horses often found on Hutsul pysanky are solar symbols.\n\nPysanky with sun motifs were said to have been especially powerful, because they could protect their owner from sickness, bad luck and the evil eye.  In Christian times the sun symbol is said to represent life, warmth, and the love and the Christian God.\n\nOther cosmomorphic symbols are less commonly seen.  The moon is sometimes depicted as a circle with a cross inside it; it is begged to shed its light at night to help the traveller, and to chase away evil powers from the household. Stars are sometimes represented as dots.\n\n== Color symbolism ==\n\nIt is not only motifs on pysanky which carried symbolic weight: colors also had significance. Although the earliest pysanky were often simply two-toned, and many folk designs still are, some believed that the more colors there were on a decorated egg, the more magical power it held. A multi-colored egg could thus bring its owner better luck and a better fate.\n\nThe color palette of traditional pysanky was fairly limited, and based on natural dyes. Yellow, red/orange, green, brown and black were the predominant colors. With the advent of aniline dyes in the 1800s, small amounts of blue and purple were sometimes added. It is important to note that the meanings below are generalizations; different regions interpreted colors differently.<ref name=\"manko folk\"/>\n\n* '''Red''' - is probably the oldest symbolic color, and has many meanings. It represents life-giving blood, and often appears on pysanky with nocturnal and heavenly symbols. It represents love and joy, and the hope of marriage.  It is also associated with the sun. \n* '''Black''' - is a particularly sacred color, and is most commonly associated with the \"other world,\" but not in a negative sense.\n* '''Yellow''' - symbolized the moon and stars and also, agriculturally, the harvest. \n* '''Blue''' - Represented blue skies or the air, and good health.\n* '''White''' - Signified purity,  birth, light, rejoicing, virginity.\n* '''Green''' - the color of new life in the spring. Green represents the resurrection of nature, and the riches of vegetation.\n* '''Brown''' - represents the earth.\n\nSome color combinations had specific meanings, too:\n\n* '''Black and white''' - mourning,  respect for the souls of the dead.\n* '''Black and red''' - this combination was perceived as \"harsh and frightful,\" and very disturbing.  It is common in Podillya, where both serpent motifs and goddess motifs were written with this combination. \n* '''Four or more colors''' - the family's happiness, prosperity, love, health and achievements.\n\nAs with symbols, these talismanic meanings of colors applied to traditional pysanky with traditional designs, and not to modern decorative pysanky.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Pysanka}}\n* [[Pysanka Museum]]\n* [[Easter egg]]\n* [[Egg decorating in Slavic culture]]\n* [[Pisanka (Polish)|Pisanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|pysanka}}\n* [http://pysanka.museum/ Pysanka Museum]\n* [http://www.pysanky.info/Voropay/Voropay.html Customs and Traditions]\n* [http://www.allthingsukrainian.com/Class/PysankyClassVideos.html Pysanka Writing Videos]\n* [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/folklorica/article/view/3782/3620 Pysanka Ethnography]\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{National symbols of Ukraine}}\n\n[[Category:Visual arts media]]\n[[Category:Handicrafts]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Slavic Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Spring traditions]]\n[[Category:Eggs in culture]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian traditions]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian design]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Ukraine]]\n\n[[da:P\u00e5ske\u00e6g]]\n[[de:Osterei]]\n[[fr:\u0152uf de P\u00e2ques]]\n[[io:Paskala ovo]]\n[[nl:Paasei]]\n[[nn:P\u00e5skeegg]]\n[[pt:Pessanka]]\n[[sl:Pirh]]\n[[fi:P\u00e4\u00e4si\u00e4ismuna]]\n[[sv:P\u00e5sk\u00e4gg]]\n[[zh:\u590d\u6d3b\u8282\u5f69\u86cb]]\n", "text_old": "A '''pysanka''' ({{lang-uk|\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430}}, plural: ''pysanky'') is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Easter egg]], decorated with traditional [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] folk designs using a [[batik|wax-resist]] method.

Several other types of decorated eggs are seen in Ukrainian tradition, and these vary throughout the [[Ukrainian historical regions|regions of Ukraine]].\n* ''Krashanky'' \u2013from ''krasyty'' (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0438), \"to decorate\"\u2013 are boiled eggs [[dyed]] a single color (with vegetable dyes, traditionally onion skin), and are blessed and eaten at Easter.\n* ''Pysanky'' \u2013from ''pysaty'' (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to write\"\u2013 are raw eggs created with the wax-resist method ([[Resist dyeing]]). The designs are \"written\" in hot wax with a pinhead or a special [[stylus]] called a ''pysachok'' (\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0447\u043e\u043a) or a ''kistka'' (\u043a\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0430) which has a small funnel attached to hold a small amount of liquid wax. The word that is used to describe the egg actually comes from the Ukrainian verb ''pysaty'', which means \"to write\".  Wooden eggs and beaded eggs are often referred to as \"pysanky\" because they mimic the decorative style of pysanky in a different medium.\n* ''Krapanky'' \u2013from ''krapka'' (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430), \"a dot\"\u2013 are raw eggs decorated using the wax-resist method, but with only dots as ornamentation (no symbols or other drawings). They are traditionally created by dripping molten wax from a beeswax candle onto an egg. They can be considered the simplest version of a pysanka, or a \"proto-pysanka.\"\n* ''Dryapanky'' \u2013from ''dryapaty'' (\u0434\u0440\u044f\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to scratch\"\u2013 are created by scratching the surface of a dyed egg to reveal the white [[animal shell|shell]] below.\n* ''Malyovanky'' \u2013from ''malyuvaty'' (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438), \"to paint\"\u2013 are created by [[painting]] a design with a brush using oil or water color paints.

This is not a traditional Ukraine practice, but has become popularized recently.\n* ''Biserky'' \u2013from ''biser'' (\u0431\u0456\u0441\u0435\u0440), \"beads\"\u2013 are created by coating an egg with beeswax, and then embedding beads into the wax to create geometric designs.\n* ''Lystovky'' \u2013from ''lystya'' (\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044f), \"leaves\"\u2013 are created by dyeing an egg to which small leaves have been attached.\nAll but the krashanky and lystovky are usually meant to be decorative (as opposed to edible), and the egg yolk and white are either allowed to dry up over time, or (in modern times) removed by blowing them out through a small hole in the egg.\n\nIn recent years, new forms of egg decoration have been brought from abroad and become popularized in Ukraine.  These include:\n\n* ''Rizblenky'' \u2013from ''rizbyty'' (\u0440\u0456\u0437\u044c\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438), \"to cut, to carve\"\u2013 are created by drilling the surface of an egg to create cut out areas.\n* ''Linyvky'' \u2013from ''linyvyi'' (\u043b\u0456\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0439), \"lazy\"\u2013 a joking term to describe eggs decorated using stickers or shrink-wrap sleeves.\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n[[Image:pysanka.jpg|thumb|right|The world's largest pysanka was erected in [[Vegreville]], [[Alberta]] in 1974, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].  ]]\n\nAccording to many scholars, the art of wax-resist (batik) egg decoration in Slavic cultures probably dates back to the pre-Christian era.

Most common are ceramic eggs decorated with a horsetail plant (\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0430 ''sosonka'') pattern in yellow and bright green against a dark background. More than 70 such eggs have been excavated throughout Ukraine, many of them from graves of children and adults. They are thought to be representations of real decorated eggs.\n\nThese ceramic eggs were common in Kievan Rus', and had a characteristic style.  They were slightly smaller than life size (2.5 by 4&nbsp;cm, or 1 by 1.6&nbsp;inches), and were created from reddish pink clays by the spiral method.  The majolica glazed eggs had a brown, green or yellow background, and showed interwoven yellow and green stripes. The eggs made in large cities like [[Kiev]] and [[Chernihiv]], which had workshops that produced clay tile and bricks; these tiles (and pysanky) were not only used locally, but were exported to Poland, and to several Scandinavian and Baltic countries.<ref>Tkachuk, Mary et al.

The pysanka was written on a goose egg, which was discovered largely intact, and the design is that of a wave pattern. The second oldest known pysanka was excavated in [[Baturyn]] in 2008, and dates to the end of the 17th century.  Baturyn was Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa|Mazepa]]'s capital, and it was razed in 1708 by the armies of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]].  A complete (but crushed) pysanka was discovered, a chicken egg shell with geometric designs against a blue-gray background.<ref>\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0447\u0443\u043a \u041d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0456\u044f.  \u0423\u041a\u0420\u0406\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c 23-07-2008</ref> The pysanka is currently being reconstructed; when completed, it will allow us to see what sort of ornamentation was in use in pre-1708 Ukraine.\n\n== Legends ==\n\nThe [[Hutsuls]]&ndash;&ndash;a group of Rusyns who live in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] around western Ukraine&ndash;&ndash;believe that the fate of the world depends upon the pysanka. As long as the egg writing custom continues, the world will exist. If, for any reason,  this custom is abandoned, evil&ndash;&ndash;in the shape of a horrible serpent who is forever chained to a cliff&ndash;&ndash; will overrun the world. Each year the serpent sends out his minions to see how many pysanky have been written. If the number is low the serpent's chains are loosened and he is free to wander the earth causing havoc and destruction. If, on the other hand, the number of pysanky has increased, the chains are tightened and good triumphs over evil for yet another year.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People) \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb, 1993</ref> \n \nNewer legends blended folklore and Christian beliefs and firmly attached the egg to the Easter celebration. One legend concerns the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. It tells of the time Mary gave eggs to the soldiers at the cross. She entreated them to be less cruel to her son and she wept. The tears of Mary fell upon the eggs, spotting them with dots of brilliant color.\n\nAnother legend tells of when [[Mary Magdalene]] went to the sepulchre to anoint the body of Jesus. She had with her a basket of eggs to serve as a repast. When she arrived at the sepulchre and uncovered the eggs, the pure white shells had miraculously taken on a rainbow of colors.\n\nA common legend tells of Simon the peddler, who helped Jesus carry his cross on the way to Calvary.  He had left his goods at the side of the road, and, when he returned, the eggs had all turned into intricately decorated pysanky.\n\n== Superstitions and folk beliefs ==\n\nMany superstitions were attached to pysanky.  Pysanky were thought to protect households from evil spirits, catastrophe, lightning and fires.  Pysanky with spiral motifs were the most powerful, as the demons and other unholy creatures would be trapped within the spirals forever. A blessed pysanka could be used to find demons hidden in the dark corners of your house.\n \nPysanky held powerful magic, and had to be disposed of properly, lest a witch get a hold of one.  She could use the shell to gather dew, and use the gathered dew to dry up a cow's milk.  The witch could also use bits of the eggshell to poke people and sicken them.  The eggshell had to be ground up very finely (and fed to chickens to make them good egg layers) or broken into pieces and tossed into a running stream.\n\nThe cloth used to dry pysanky was powerful, too, and could be used to cure skin diseases. And it was considered very bad luck to trample on a pysanka\u2014God would punish anyone who did with a variety of illnesses.<ref>\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0439, \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0417\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Folk Customs of Our People)  \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0433\u00bb,  1993</ref>\n\nThere were superstitions regarding the colors and designs on the pysanky. One old Ukrainian myth centered on the wisdom of giving older people gifts of pysanky with darker colors and/or rich designs, for their life has already been filled.  Similarly, it is appropriate to give young people pysanky with white as the predominant color because their life is still a blank page. Girls would often give pysanky to young men they fancied, and include heart motifs.  It was said, though, that a girl should never give her boyfriend a pysanky that has no design on the top and bottom of the egg, as this might signify that the boyfriend would soon lose his hair.\n\n== Writing pysanky ==\n[[File:Unfinished pysanka.jpg|thumb|An unfinished pysanka ready for the black bath of dye. It bears the Ukrainian Easter greeting: \"Christ is risen!\"]]\n[[File:UkieStyluses.jpg|thumb|A variety of [[canting|styluses]], from traditional to modern]]\n\nEach region, each village, and almost every family in Ukraine had its own special ritual, its own symbols, meanings and secret formulas for dyeing eggs.  These customs were preserved faithfully and passed down from mother to daughter through generations.  The custom of decorating pysanky was observed with greatest care, and a pysanka, after receiving the Easter blessing, was held to have great powers as a talisman.\n\nPysanky were traditionally made during the last week of Lent, Holy Week in the Orthodox and Greek ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate]]) Catholic calendars. (Both faiths are represented in Ukraine, and both still celebrate Easter by the [[Julian calendar]].) They were made by the women of the family.  During the middle of the Lenten season, women began putting aside eggs, those that were most perfectly shaped and smooth, and ideally, the first laid eggs of young hens. There had to be a rooster, as only fertilized eggs could be used.  (If non-fertile eggs were used, there would be no fertility in the home.)\n\nThe dyes were prepared from dried plants, roots, bark, berries and insects ([[Polish cochineal|cochineal]]).  Yellow was obtained from the flowers of the [[Genista tinctoria|woadwaxen]], and gold from onion skins.  Red could be extracted from [[Haematoxylum campechianum|logwood]] or cochineal, and dark green and violet from the husks of sunflower seeds and the berries and bark of the elderberry bush.  Black dye was made from walnut husks.  The dyes were prepared in secret, using recipes handed down from mother to daughter.  Sometimes chemical dyes (of unusual or difficult colors) were purchased from peddlers along with [[alum]], a [[mordant]] that helped the [[natural dye]]s adhere better to eggshells.\n\nA [[canting|stylus]], known as a pysachok, pysak, pysal'tse, or kystka (kistka), depending on region, was prepared. A piece of thin brass was wrapped around a needle, forming a hollow cone.  This was attached to a small stick (willow was preferred) with wire or horsehair.  In the Lemko regions a simple pin or nail inserted onto the end of a stick was used instead (drop-pull technique).\n\nThe pysanky were made at night, when the children were asleep.  The women in the family gathered together, said the appropriate prayers, and went to work.  It was done in secret&ndash;&ndash;the patterns and color combinations were handed down from mother to daughter and carefully guarded.\n\nPysanky were made using a wax resist (batik) method. [[Beeswax]] was heated in a small bowl on the large family stove (\u043f\u0456\u0447), and the styluses were dipped into it.  The molten wax was applied to the white egg with a writing motion; any bit of shell covered with wax would be sealed, and remain white.  Then the egg was dyed yellow, and more wax applied, and then orange, red, purple, black.  (The dye sequence was always light to dark).  Bits of shell covered with wax remained that color.  After the final color, usually red, brown or black, the wax was removed by heating the egg in the stove and gently wiping off the melted wax, or by briefly dipping the egg into boiling water.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HR6mT6nEIsb5ggf8ovSZAQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgy#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Where Easter Eggs Rival The Rainbow.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1944, pp. 88-89.</ref>\n\nBoiled eggs were not used, as pysanky were generally written on raw or, less commonly, baked eggs (pecharky).  Boiled eggs were [[red Easter eggs|dyed red for Easter]], using an onion skin dye, and called \"krashanky\".  The number of colors on an egg was usually limited, as natural dyes had very long dyeing times, sometimes hours.  Pysanky would be written\u2013and dyed\u2013in batches.\n\nAlternatively, in ethnic Lemko and Boiko areas, as well as Nadsiannia, the drop pull method was also utilized. A pinhead was dipped into molten wax and then applied to the shell of the egg. Simple drops were made, or there was an additional pulling motion, which would create teardrop or comma shapes. These drops were used to create patterns and designs.  Dyeing and wax removal proceeded as with traditional pysanky.\n\nPysanky continue to be made in modern times; while many traditional aspects have been preserved, new technologies are in evidence.  Aniline dyes have largely replaced natural dyes.  Styluses are now made with modern materials.  Traditional styluses are still made from brass and wood, but those made with more modern plastic handles are gaining in popularity. An electric version of the stylus has been commercially available since the 1970s, with the cone becoming a metal reservoir which keeps the melted beeswax at a constant temperature and holds a much larger amount than a traditional stylus.  These newer styluses (whether electric or not) also sport machined heads, with sizes or the opening ranging from extra-extra-fine to extra-heavy.\n\n== Sharing pysanky ==\n[[File:EasterInLvov2.jpg|thumb|[[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[priest]] blessing Easter baskets in [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]]]\nPysanky are typically made to be given to family members and respected outsiders. To give a pysanka is to give a symbolic gift of life, which is why the egg must remain whole. Furthermore, the design, a combination of the motifs and colors on a traditional folk pysanka, has a deep, symbolic meaning. Traditionally, a pysanka given with its symbolic meaning in mind, be it wishes of protection, fecundity, or love. Typically, pysanky were displayed prominently in a public room of the house.\n\nIn a large family, by Holy Thursday, 60 or more eggs would have been completed by the women of the house. (The more daughters a family had, the more pysanky would be produced.) The eggs would then be taken to the church on Easter Sunday to be blessed, after which they were given away. Here is a partial list of how the pysanky would be used:\n\n# One or two would be given to the priest.\n# Three or four were taken to the cemetery and placed on graves of the family.\n# Ten or twenty were given to children or godchildren.\n# Ten or twelve were exchanged by the unmarried girls with the eligible men in the community.\n# Several were saved to place in the coffin of loved ones who might die during the year.\n# Several were saved to keep in the home for protection from fire, lightning and storms.\n# Two or three were placed in the mangers of cows and horses to ensure safe calving and colting and a good milk supply for the young.\n# At least one egg was placed beneath the bee hive to ensure good production of honey.\n# One was saved for each grazing animal to be taken out to the fields with the shepherds in the spring.\n# Several pysanky were placed in the nests of hens to encourage the laying of eggs.\n\nEveryone from the youngest to the oldest received a pysanka for Easter.  Young people were given pysanky with bright designs; dark pysanky were given to older people.\n\nA bowl full of pysanky was invariably kept in every home.  It served not only as a colorful display, but also as protection from all dangers.  Some of the eggs were emptied, and a bird\u2019s head made of wax or dough and wings and tail-feathers of folded paper were attached.  These \u201cdoves\u201d were suspended before icons in commemoration of the birth of Christ, when a dove came down from heaven and soared over the child Jesus.\n\n== Symbolism in pysanky ==\n[[File:A basket full of Hutsul pysanky.JPG|thumb|200px|A basket full of Hutsul pysanky]]\n\nA great variety of ornamental motifs are found on pysanky.  Because of the egg\u2019s fragility, few ancient examples of pysanky have survived.  However, similar design motifs occur in pottery, woodwork, metalwork, [[Ukrainian embroidery]] and other folk arts,<ref>Selivachov, Mykhailo. Folk Designs of Ukraine Doncaster, Australia: Bayda Books, 1995</ref> many of which have survived.\n\nThe symbols which decorated pysanky underwent a process of adaptation over time. In pre-Christian times these symbols imbued an egg with magical powers to ward off evil spirits, banish winter, guarantee a good harvest and bring a person good luck. After 988, when Christianity became the state religion of Ukraine, the interpretation of many of the symbols began to change, and the pagan motifs were reinterpreted in a Christian light.\n\nSince the mid-19th century, pysanky have been created more for decorative reasons than for the purposes of magic, especially among the Diaspora, as belief in most such rituals and practices has fallen by the wayside in a more modern, scientific era.  Additionally, the Ukrainian diaspora has reinterpreted meanings and created their own new symbols and interpretations of older ones.<ref>\nLesiv, Mariya . [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/folklorica/article/view/3782/3620 From Ritual Object To Art Form: The Ukrainian Easter Egg Pysanka In Its Canadian Context]. Folklorica, Journal of the Slavic and East European Folkore Association. Vol 12 (2007)</ref>\n\nThe names and meaning of various symbols and design elements vary from region to region, and even from village to village.  Similar symbols can have totally different interpretations in different places. There are several thousand different motifs in Ukrainian folk designs.  They can be grouped into several families. Keep in mind that these talismanic meanings applied to traditional folk pysanky with traditional designs, not to modern original creations.\n\n=== Geometric ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Polissia.svg|120px|thumbnail|Sorokoklyn from [[Polissia]]]]\nThe most popular pysanka designs are geometric figures. The egg itself is most often divided by straight lines into squares, triangles and other shapes. These shapes are then filled with other forms and designs. These are also among the most ancient symbols, with the \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0442\u043e (resheto, sieve) motif dating back to Paleolithic times. Other ancient geometric symbols are agricultural in nature: triangles, which symbolized clouds or rain; quadrilaterals, especially those with a resheto design in them, symbolized a ploughed field; dots stood for seeds.\n\nGeometric symbols used quite commonly on pysanky today.  The triangle is said to symbolize the Holy Trinity; in ancient times it symbolized other trinities: the elements of air, fire and water, the family (man, woman and child) or the cycle of life (birth, life, and death).  Diamonds, a type of quadrilateral, are sometimes said to symbolize knowledge. Curls/spirals are ancient symbols of the Zmiya/Serpent, and are said to have a meaning of defense or protection. The spiral is said to be protective against the \"\u043d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430\";  an evil spirit which happens to enter a house will be drawn into the spiral and trapped there. Dots, which can represent seeds, stars or cuckoo birds\u2019 eggs (a symbol of spring), are popularly said to be the tears of the blessed Virgin. Hearts are also sometimes seen, and, as in other cultures, they represent love.\n[[File:Meander Motif on a Ukrainian Pysanka.JPG|thumb|200px|A meander motif on a traditional pysanka]]\nOne interesting adaptation of the geometric design is not a symbol per se but a division of the egg called \"forty triangles\" (actually 48) or \"Sorokoklyn (forty wedges).\" Its ancient meaning is not known, but is often said to represent the forty days of lent, the forty martyrs, the forty days that Christ spent in the desert, or the forty life tasks of married couples.\n\n==== Eternity bands ====\nEternity bands or meanders are composed of waves, lines or ribbons; such a line is called a \"bezkonechnyk.\"  A line without end is said to represent immortality.  Waves, however, are a water symbol, and thus a symbol of the Zmiya/Serpent, the ancient water god.  Waves are therefore considered an agricultural symbol, because it is rain that ensures good crops.\n\n===Berehynia===\n[[File:Berehynia Pysanka.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a berehynia motif]]\nThe goddess motif is an ancient one, and most commonly found in pysanky from Polissia or Western Podillia. The berehynia was believed to be the source of life and death. On the one hand, she is a life giving mother, the creator of heaven and all living things, and the mistress of heavenly water (rain), upon which the world relies for fertility and fruitfulness. On the other hand, she was the merciless controller of destinies.\n\nThe goddess is sometimes depicted with arms upraised, and the arms vary in number but are always in pairs: 2, 4 or 6. This is similar to the appearance of the Christian Oranta. Pysanky with this motif were called \u201cbohyn\u2019ky\u201d (\u0431\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438, little goddesses) or \u201czhuchky\u201d (\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0438, beetles), the latter because they are similar in appearance to the Cyrillic letter \u0416 (zh).  Sometimes the berehynia has become abstracted, and is represented by a plant\u2014vazon\u2014the tree of life. Her arms become the branches and flowers, and she is firmly rooted in a flowerpot.\n\nThe most common depiction of the great goddess is a composition containing \u201ckucheri\u201d (curls). The berehynia may be seen perched on a curl, or a curl may be given wings; the symbol may be doubled, end-to-end. There is usually a crown on the berehynia\u2019s head. These compositions are given the folk names of \u201cqueen,\u201d \u201cprincess,\u201d \"rooster,\" \u201cscythe,\u201d \u201cdrake,\u201d or simply \u201cwings.\"\n\n=== Christian symbols ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Church Motif.JPG|thumb|150px|A traditional pysanka with a church motif]]\nThe only true traditional Christian symbol, and not one adapted from an earlier pagan one, is the church. Stylized churches are often found on pysanky from Hutsul regions (including parts of Bukovyna). Church parts are usually in threes: three stories/roofs, three towers, three openings (windows, doors). Sometimes only the bell tower (dzvinytsia) is depicted.\n\nCrosses are fairly common, although most of those found on traditional pysanky are not Ukrainian (Byzantine) crosses. The crosses most commonly depicted are of the simple \"Greek\" cross type, with arms of equal lengths. This type of cross predates Christianity, and is a sun symbol (an abstracted representation of the solar bird); it is sometimes combined with the star (ruzha) motif. The \"cross crosslet\" type of cross, one in which the ends of each arm are crossed, is frequently seen, particularly on Hutsul and Bukovynian pysanky.\n\nOther adapted religious symbols include a triangle with a circle in the center, denoting the eye of God, and one known as the \"hand of god.\"\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the commercially produced folk pysanky of the Carpathians, especially [[Kosmach]], have begun displaying more Christian symbols.  The lower arm of the cross in older designs is often lengthened to appear more Christian, even if it throws off the symmetry of the design. [[Crucifix]]es are sometimes seen. Pysanky are being written with depictions of Easter baskets on them, including a [[Paska (bread)|paska]] and candle. [[Doves as symbols|White doves]], symbols of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]], are also more frequently seen; doves are usually depicted in flight, while other wild birds are traditionally shown perched.\n\n=== Phytomorphic (plant) motifs ===\n\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky from Priashivshchyna 01.svg|thumbnail|150px|Floral ornaments from [[Lemkivshchyna]]]]\nThe most common motifs found on pysanky are those associated with plants and their parts (flowers and fruit). Women who wrote pysanky drew their inspiration from the world of nature, depicting flowers, trees, fruits, leaves and whole plants in a highly stylized (not realistic) fashion. Such ornaments symbolized the rebirth of nature after winter, and pysanky were written with plant motifs to guarantee a good harvest. A most popular floral design is a plant in a vase of standing on its own, which symbolized the tree of life and was a highly abstracted version of the berehynia (great goddess).\n\nPysanky created by the [[mountain people]] of the Hutsul region of Ukraine often showed a stylized fir tree branch, a symbol of youth and eternal life. Trees, in general, symbolized strength, renewal, creation, growth; as with animal motifs, the parts (leaves, branches) had the same symbolic meaning as the whole.  The oak tree was a sacred to the ancient god Perun, the most powerful of the pagan Slavic pantheon, and thus oak leaves symbolized strength.\n\nPussy willow branches are sometimes depicted on pysanky; in Ukraine, the pussy willow replaces the palm leaf on Palm Sunday.  This is not a common motif, though, and may be a more recent addition.\n\nTwo very popular plant motifs on modern diasporan pysanky are poppies and wheat; these motifs are never seen on traditional pysanky, and are purely a modern invention.\n\n==== Flowers ====\n[[File:Ruzha (Ukrainian Pysanka).JPG|thumb|200px|A Ukrainian pysanka with a ruzha (eight pointed star) motif]]\nFlowers are a common pysanka motif. They can be divided into two types: specific botanical types, and non-specific.\n\nSpecific botanical types include sunflowers, daisies, violets, carnations, periwinkle and lily-of the-valley. These flowers are represented with identifying features that make them recognizable. Carnations will have a serrated edge to the petals, the flowers of the lily of the valley will be arrayed along a stem, periwinkle will have three or four leaves (periwinkle is represented by its leaves, not its flowers, on pysanky).\n\nThere are also flower motifs called orchids and tulips, but these are not botanical names.  They are actually the names given to fantastical flowers, as neither of these flowers was commonly found in Ukraine until modern times. The names reflected the exoticism of the designs.\n[[File:Vazon (Tree of Life).JPG|thumb|150px|Traditional Ukrainian pysanka from Bukovyna region, with a vazon motif]]\nNon-specific flowers are much more common, and consist of the ruzha and others. The ruzha (or rozha) is named after the mallow flower, although it does not resemble one, and is another name given to the eight-pointed star motif.  A ruzha can be full, empty, compound, divided or even crooked. It is a sun sign. Other non-specific types often have hyphenated names: potato-flower, strawberry-flower, etc.  They are usually simple arrangements of petals, six or more, and bear little resemblance to the plant they are named for.\n\n====Vazon/Tree of Life====\nThe \u201ctree of life\u201d motif is widely used in traditional pysanky designs. It can be represented in many ways. Sometimes it appears as two deer on either side of a pine tree. More often it manifests as a flower pot (\u201cvazon\u201d), filled with leaves and flowers.  The pot itself is usually a rectangle, triangle or a rhomboid (symbolic of the earth), and is covered with dots (seeds) and dashes (water). Many branches grow out of it, in a symmetric fashion, with leaves and flowers. This plant is a berehynia (goddess) symbol, with the branches representing the many arms of the mother goddess.\n\n==== Fruit ====\nFruit is not a common motif on pysanky, but is sometimes represented. Apples, plums and cherries are depicted on traditional pysanky. Currants and viburnum (kalyna) berries are sometimes seen, too. These motifs are probably related to fecundity. Grapes are seen more often, as they have been transformed from an agricultural motif to a religious one, representing the Holy Communion.\n\n=== Scevomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Rake Motifs.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with rake motifs]]\nScevomorphic designs are the second-largest group of designs, and are representations of man-made agricultural objects. These symbols are very common, as Ukraine was a highly agricultural society, and drew many of its positive images from field and farm. Some of these symbols are actually related to agriculture; others have older meanings, but were renamed in more recent times based on their appearance.\n\nCommon symbols include the ladder (symbolizing [[prayer]]s going up to heaven) and the sieve/resheto (a plowed field, or perhaps the separation of good and evil).\n\nRakes and combs are often depicted; both are meant to invoke a good harvest. Both are rain symbols. The body of the rake (sometimes depicted as a triangle) is the cloud, and the teeth symbolize rain drops. (Note: these combs are not hair combs, but agricultural implements.)\n\nWindmills, a variation on the broken cross (swastika) motif, are actually sun symbols, not agricultural symbols. The movement of the cross echoes the movement of the sun across the sky.\n\n=== Zoomorphic (animal) motifs ===\n[[File:Ukrainian pysanky -- Teeth of wolf from Odessa.svg|thumbnail|150px|Wolf's teeth [[Odessa]]]]\nAlthough animal motifs are not as popular as plant motifs, they are nevertheless found on pysanky, especially those of the people of the Carpathian Mountains. Animal depicted on pysanky include both wild animals (deer, birds, fish) and domesticated ones (rams, horses, poultry).  As with plants, animals were depicted in the abstract, highly stylized, and not with realistic detail.\n\nHorses were popular ornaments because they symbolized strength and endurance, as well as wealth and prosperity. They also had a second meaning as a sun symbol: in some versions of pagan mythology, the sun was drawn across the sky by the steeds of Dazhboh, the sun god. Similarly, deer designs were fairly common as they were intended to bring prosperity and long life; in other versions of the myth, it was the stag who carried the sun across the sky on his antlers.  Rams are symbols of leadership, strength, dignity, and perseverance.\n\nSometime women simply drew parts of animals; these symbols were probably a sort of shorthand, endowed with all the attributes of the animal represented. Ducks\u2019 necks, goose feet, rabbits\u2019 ears, rams\u2019 horns, wolves\u2019 teeth, bear claws, and bulls\u2019 eyes can all be found on pysanky.  One cannot be sure, however, if these symbols were actually meant to represent animals, or were renamed centuries later because of their appearance.\n\n==== Birds ====\n[[File:Ukrainian Pysanka with Birds.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with bird motifs]]\nBirds were considered the harbingers of spring, thus they were a commonplace pysanka motif.  Birds of all kinds are the messengers of the sun and heaven. Birds are always shown perched, at rest, never flying (except for swallows and, in more recent times, white doves carrying letters). Roosters are symbols of masculinity, or the coming of dawn, and hens represent fertility.\n\nBirds were almost always shown in full profile, stylized, but with characteristic features of the species. Partial representations of some birds&ndash;&ndash;mostly domestic fowl&ndash;&ndash;are often seen on pysanky. Bird parts (eyes, feet, beaks, combs, feathers) are said carry the same meaning as the entire bird. Thus hen's feet represent fertility and the rooster's comb signifies masculinity.\n\n==== Insects ====\nInsects are only rarely depicted on pysanky. Highly stylized spiders (and occasionally their webs) are the most common on folk pysanky, and symbolize perseverance. Beetles are sometimes seen, but rarely look anything like a beetle. What they do resemble, somewhat, is the letter \u0416, as in their Ukrainian name \"\u0436\u0443\u0447\u043e\u043a.\" Other insects are sometimes seen on modern, diasporan pysanky, most commonly butterflies and bees, but seem to be a modern innovation.  In Onyshchuk's \"Symbolism of the Ukrainian Pysanka\" she depicts pysanky with a butterfly motif, but the original design, recorded by Kulzhynsky in 1899, was labeled as being swallows' tails.\n\n==== Fish ====\n[[File:Spirals Zmiya.jpg|thumb|150px|A traditional Ukrainian pysanka with spirals]]\nThe fish, originally a symbol of health, eventually came to symbolize Jesus Christ, the \"fisher of men.\"  In old Ukrainian fairy tales, the fish often helped the hero to win his fight with evil. In the Greek alphabet \u201cfish\u201d ([[ichthys]]) is an [[acrostic]] of \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior,\u201d and it became a secret symbol used by the early Christians.  The fish represents abundance, as well as Christian interpretations of baptism, sacrifice, the powers of regeneration, and Christ himself.\n\n==== Serpent ====\n\nAnother ancient symbol is that of the \u0437\u043c\u0456\u044f or serpent, the ancient god of water and earth.  The serpent could be depicted in several ways: as an \"S\" or sigma, as a curl or spiral, or as a wave. When depicted as a sigma, the zmiya often wears a crown. Depictions of the serpent can be found on Neolithic Trypillian pottery. The serpent symbol on a ''pysanka'' is said to bring protection from catastrophe.  Spirals were particularly strong talismans, as an evil spirit, upon entering the house, would be drawn into the spiral and trapped there.\n\n=== Cosmomorphic motifs ===\n[[File:Pysanka with Swastika motif.jpg|thumb|150px|Traditional pysanka with a swastika (svarha) motif]]\nAmong the oldest and most important symbols of pysanky is the sun, and the simplest rendering of the sun is a closed circle with or without rays. Pysanky from all regions of Ukraine depict an eight-sided star, the most common depiction of the sun; this symbol is also called a \"ruzha.\"  Six- or seven-sided stars can also be seen, but much less commonly.\n\nThe sun can also appear as a flower or a \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442 (three leaf). The [[swastika]], called in Ukrainian a \"svarha,\" is sometimes referred to as a \"broken cross\" or \"ducks\u2019 necks.\" It represented the sun in pagan times: the movement of the arms around the cross represented the movement of the sun across the sky. The Slavic pagans also believed that the sun did not rise on its own, but was carried across the sky by a stag (or, in some versions, a horse).  The deer and horses often found on Hutsul pysanky are solar symbols.\n\nPysanky with sun motifs were said to have been especially powerful, because they could protect their owner from sickness, bad luck and the evil eye.  In Christian times the sun symbol is said to represent life, warmth, and the love and the Christian God.\n\nOther cosmomorphic symbols are less commonly seen.  The moon is sometimes depicted as a circle with a cross inside it; it is begged to shed its light at night to help the traveller, and to chase away evil powers from the household. Stars are sometimes represented as dots.\n\n== Color symbolism ==\n\nIt is not only motifs on pysanky which carried symbolic weight: colors also had significance. Although the earliest pysanky were often simply two-toned, and many folk designs still are, some believed that the more colors there were on a decorated egg, the more magical power it held. A multi-colored egg could thus bring its owner better luck and a better fate.\n\nThe color palette of traditional pysanky was fairly limited, and based on natural dyes. Yellow, red/orange, green, brown and black were the predominant colors. With the advent of aniline dyes in the 1800s, small amounts of blue and purple were sometimes added. It is important to note that the meanings below are generalizations; different regions interpreted colors differently.<ref name=\"manko folk\"/>\n\n* '''Red''' - is probably the oldest symbolic color, and has many meanings. It represents life-giving blood, and often appears on pysanky with nocturnal and heavenly symbols. It represents love and joy, and the hope of marriage.  It is also associated with the sun. \n* '''Black''' - is a particularly sacred color, and is most commonly associated with the \"other world,\" but not in a negative sense.\n* '''Yellow''' - symbolized the moon and stars and also, agriculturally, the harvest. \n* '''Blue''' - Represented blue skies or the air, and good health.\n* '''White''' - Signified purity,  birth, light, rejoicing, virginity.\n* '''Green''' - the color of new life in the spring. Green represents the resurrection of nature, and the riches of vegetation.\n* '''Brown''' - represents the earth.\n\nSome color combinations had specific meanings, too:\n\n* '''Black and white''' - mourning,  respect for the souls of the dead.\n* '''Black and red''' - this combination was perceived as \"harsh and frightful,\" and very disturbing.  It is common in Podillya, where both serpent motifs and goddess motifs were written with this combination. \n* '''Four or more colors''' - the family's happiness, prosperity, love, health and achievements.\n\nAs with symbols, these talismanic meanings of colors applied to traditional pysanky with traditional designs, and not to modern decorative pysanky.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Pysanka}}\n* [[Pysanka Museum]]\n* [[Easter egg]]\n* [[Egg decorating in Slavic culture]]\n* [[Pisanka (Polish)|Pisanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|pysanka}}\n* [http://pysanka.museum/ Pysanka Museum]\n* [http://www.pysanky.info/Voropay/Voropay.html Customs and Traditions]\n* [http://www.allthingsukrainian.com/Class/PysankyClassVideos.html Pysanka Writing Videos]\n* [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/folklorica/article/view/3782/3620 Pysanka Ethnography]\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{National symbols of Ukraine}}\n\n[[Category:Visual arts media]]\n[[Category:Handicrafts]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Slavic Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Easter traditions]]\n[[Category:Spring traditions]]\n[[Category:Eggs in culture]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian traditions]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian design]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Ukraine]]\n\n[[da:P\u00e5ske\u00e6g]]\n[[de:Osterei]]\n[[fr:\u0152uf de P\u00e2ques]]\n[[io:Paskala ovo]]\n[[nl:Paasei]]\n[[nn:P\u00e5skeegg]]\n[[pt:Pessanka]]\n[[sl:Pirh]]\n[[fi:P\u00e4\u00e4si\u00e4ismuna]]\n[[sv:P\u00e5sk\u00e4gg]]\n[[zh:\u590d\u6d3b\u8282\u5f69\u86cb]]\n", "name_user": "2603:9001:9201:b12:fdd3:c8c8:4b3e:9ce5", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pysanka"}

The club also produced many famous Iranian players such as [[Masoud Boroumand]], [[Homayoun Behzadi]] and [[Mehrab Shahrokhi]].\n\n[[File:Shahinfc.jpg|thumb|220px|right|'''Shahin F.C. in mid 1960s'''<br><small>Many of the players shown in this photo went on to play for Persepolis.</small>]]\n\nShahin FC, without any doubt was the most popular football club in the history of Iranian football. Shahin produced many talented players like [[Parviz Dehdari]], [[Masoud Boroumand]], [[Homayoun Behzadi]], [[Jafar Kashani]], [[Hossein Kalani]], [[Hamid Shirzadegan]], and many more that played for [[Team Melli]]. These talents made Shahin popular in the 1960s but its very popularity was viewed as a threat by the [[IRIFF|Iran Football Federation]] and the ''Keihan Varzeshi'' newspaper (Iran's most important sports publication at the time).<ref name=\"enhelal\"/> The conflict between them became worse and on July 9, 1967, two days after Shahin's 3\u20130 win against [[Tehranjavan F.C.]], the Iran Sports Organization declared Shahin F.C. as dissolved.<ref name=\"enhelal\">{{cite web\n|title=40 \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0646\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e\u064a \u0634\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0646\n|url=http://www.etemaad.com/Released/86-04-14/225.htm|publisher= etemad.com\n|accessdate=2007-07-05|language=fa}}</ref> League attendance dropped and other clubs including [[Pas Tehran F.C.|Pas Tehran]], [[Rah Ahan F.C.|Rah Ahan]], and [[Oghab F.C.|Oghab]] tried to sign Shahin players.\n\nDespite the efforts to sign and disperse Shahin players to various clubs, Parviz Dehdari, newly appointed manager of [[Persepolis F.C.]], and Masoud Boroumand persuaded most Shahin players to join Persepolis and granted the popularity of Shahin to Persepolis.\n\n===Shahbaz Era===\nIn 1973 Shahin F.C. decided to come back but returned with the name of its former third team '''Shahbaz F.C.''' and participated in [[Takht Jamshid Cup]] professional soccer League. Shahbaz F.C. was leading the league in the [[1978\u201379 Takht Jamshid Cup|1978\u20131979]] season which was unfinished due to [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979. After the revolution, the club reverted to its original name, \"Shahin\", and was one of the top teams of in Iranian football during the 1980s.\n\nIn [[2009\u201310 Iran Football's 3rd Division|2009/10]] Shahin was competing in the third ranked [[Iran Football's 2nd Division|2nd Division]] successfully until the last stage, when they failed to be promoted to the Azadegan [[Iran Football's 1st Division|1st Division]]. In [[2010\u201311 Iran Football's 3rd Division|2010/11]] Shahin kept its place in the 3rd Division.\n\nIn [[2011\u201312 Iran Football's 3rd Division|2011/12]] Shahin finished last in its group and therefore is relegated to the provincial league for 2012/13.\n\n==Branches and affiliated clubs==\nShahin F.C. had several attached teams and branches under the name and license of Shahin F.C. in different cities of Iran, including '''[[Shahin Bushehr F.C.]]''' (est. 1942), '''[[Shahin Ahvaz F.C.]]''' (est. 1948) and '''Shahin Isfahan F.C.'''(est. 1953). In 1967 due to the political problems that arose in the Shahin F.C. organization, the other teams were forced to cease operations as well. Some had to deactivate for a period of time, while other teams renamed and continued under different names.\n\n'''[[Persepolis F.C.]]''' started the 1968 season with Parviz Dehdari as manager. Despite the efforts to sign and disperse Shahin players to various clubs, [[Parviz Dehdari]] and [[Masoud Boroumand]] transferred the popularity of Shahin to Persepolis F.C. by taking most Shahin Players to join Persepolis. Persepolis F.C. using four Shahin players, had a friendly match with ''Jam Abadan'', a respected team at the time. After the match the remainder of the Shahin players joined Persepolis. Although Shahin Tehran established in a new team under the name of Shahbaz, it was failed to get back its popularity again.\n\n'''Shahin Isfahan F.C.''' changed its name to '''[[Sepahan F.C.]]'''. The club is one of the representatives of [[Isfahan Province]] in [[Takht Jamshid Cup]] national league. The team now plays under the name of Foolad Mobarakeh Sepahan, and has been able to attain a respectable fan base in its hometown.\n\n'''[[Shahin Bushehr F.C.|Shahin Bushehr]]''' is one of the most popular clubs of Iran. After years of history and competing in different levels of the [[Iranian football league system]], including a 1994\u201395 appearance in the [[Iran Pro League|top division]] and several years in the second level, Shahin Bushehr was renamed '''Shahin Pars Jonoubi Bushehr''' in 2007 and promoted to [[Iran's Premier Football League|IPL]] in 2009. The club is now owned by ''Pars Special Economic Energy Zone'', based in [[Asalouyeh]], [[Bushehr Province]] and currently competes in the [[Iran Football's 2nd Division|2nd Division]] after being relegated from [[Azadegan League]] in 2013.\n\n'''[[Shahin Ahvaz F.C.]]''' was founded in 1948 and was one of Shahin Tehran F.C. branches at the time. The golden years of '''Shahin Ahvaz F.C.''' were in the 1980s when the team won its very first \"Hazfi cup\" after defeating Persepolis Tehran in the semi-finals and then [[Malavan F.C.|Malavan Anzali]] in the final game. This winning made them qualify to the Asian Club Championship. They currently compete in the Provincial Leagues.\n\n==Colours and crest==\nThe usual home kit includes a white shirt, black shorts, and white socks.

Shahbaz F.C. was leading the league in the [[1978\u201379 Takht Jamshid Cup|1978\u20131979]] season which was unfinished due to [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979. After the revolution, the club reverted to its original name, \"Shahin\", and was among one of the top teams of in Iranian football during the 1980s.\n\nIn [[2009\u201310 Iran Football's 3rd Division|2009/10]] Shahin was competing in the third ranked [[Iran Football's 2nd Division|2nd Division]] successfully until the last stage, when they failed to be promoted to the Azadegan [[Iran Football's 1st Division|1st Division]].

In 1967 due to the political problems that arose in the Shahin F.C. organization, the other teams were forced to cease operations as well. Some had to deactivate for a period of time, while other teams renamed and continued under different names.\n\n'''[[Persepolis F.C.]]''' started the 1968 season with Parviz Dehdari as manager. Despite the efforts to sign and disperse Shahin players to various clubs, [[Parviz Dehdari]] and [[Masoud Boroumand]] transferred the popularity of Shahin to Persepolis F.C. by taking most Shahin Players to join Persepolis. Persepolis F.C. using four Shahin players, had a friendly match with ''Jam Abadan'', a respected team at the time. After the match the remainder of the Shahin players joined Persepolis. Although Shahin Tehran established in a new team under the name of Shahbaz, it was failed to get back its popularity again.\n\n'''Shahin Isfahan F.C.''' changed its name to '''[[Sepahan F.C.]]'''.

The club is now owned by ''Pars Special Economic Energy Zone'', based in [[Asalouyeh]], [[Bushehr Province]] and currently competes in the [[Iran Football's 2nd Division|2nd Division]] after being relegated from [[Azadegan League]] in 2013.\n\n'''[[Shahin Ahvaz F.C.]]''' was founded in 1948 and was one of Shahin Tehran F.C. branches at the time. The golden years of '''Shahin Ahvaz F.C.''' were in the 1980s when the team won its very first \"Hazfi cup\" after defeating Persepolis Tehran in the semi-finals and then [[Malavan F.C.|Malavan Anzali]] in the final game. This winning made them qualify to the Asian Club Championship. They currently compete in the Provincial Leagues.\n\n==Colours and crest==\nThe usual home kit includes a white shirt, black shorts, and white socks.

These are arrayed on three campuses that comprise four acres. \n\nThirty-eight percent of Durham Academy's students are people of color, as are 17 percent of teachers.\n\nIn 2019-20, Durham Academy awarded more than $2,200,000 in financial aid (not including tuition remission and need-based financial aid for faculty and staff); the average award was $14,682.\n\nDurham Academy's official mission is \"to provide each student an education that will enable him or her to live a moral, happy and productive life.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.da.org/page.cfm?p=505|title=Durham Academy Mission and History|website=www.da.org|access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nDurham Academy was founded in 1933, as the Calvert Method School, by George Watts Hill and his wife Ann McCollough Hill. The couple established the school as a private, independent school to educate their children. The school's teaching philosophy (and its name) were based on the Calvert School in Baltimore, Maryland, which Ann McCollough Hill attended as a child. The Calvert Method School's first home was in Durham's [[Forest Hills Historic District (Durham, North Carolina)|Forest Hills neighborhood]], with the neighborhood's clubhouse serving as a classroom for seven students and one teacher.\n\nIn 1937, the Calvert Method School moved to [[John Sprunt Hill]]'s former home at 815 S. Duke Street.\n\nIn 1959, the school ended its affiliation with Baltimore's Calvert School and changed its name to Durham Academy. Durham Academy also became a member of the National Council of Independent Schools and added an eighth grade.\n\nIn May 1965, Durham Academy broke ground on a new campus on Highway 751 (later named Academy Road). Students and teachers moved into the new facility in March 1966.\n\nDurham Academy added to the Academy Road campus during the early 1970s. Plans for a starting high school were also explored.\n\nIn 1971, Durham Academy purchased and broke ground on 42 acres of land on Ridge Road to launch the Upper School. The Upper School opened in September 1973, and Durham Academy's first senior class graduated in June 1975. George Watts Hill and Frank Hawkins Kenan were both instrumental in the creation of Durham Academy's Upper School. Kenan, whose children had attended Calvert Method School and later Durham Academy, made an anonymous gift of $1 million to build the Upper School campus. George Watts Hill established an endowment for Durham Academy, to which Kenan later contributed nearly $3 million.\n\nIn 1977, George Watts Hill, Fred Brooks and Bill Friday founded the Learning Development Center (now known as The Hill Center), for children with learning differences. The LDC, located on Durham Academy's Ridge Road campus, had a close relationship with Durham Academy, but had its own faculty and a separate facility for its 13 students and four teachers. The Hill Center currently operates as an affiliate of Durham Academy in its facility on Pickett Rd. The center's focus is on intensive remediation and tutoring for students with learning differences and training teachers to help students with learning differences.\n\nBy 1978 Durham Academy had grown to 795 students in grades K-12. From the late 1970s to early 1980s the school developed an honor code, a Cum Laude Society, a faculty summer grants program and established an excellence in teaching award named after then-headmaster F. Robertson Hershey.\n\nIn 1983, Durham Academy celebrated its 50th anniversary with ceremonies led by founder George Watts Hill.\n\nIn 1986, the school added to the Academy Road campus with a new library/arts/science building. That same year, Durham Academy began hosting the Durham County Special Olympics, which includes an estimated 400 athletes from all Durham County Public Schools. Upper School students and faculty plan the annual event. The entire Upper School closes on the day of the games so that students and faculty can all volunteer and host the athletes.\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s saw major Middle School and Upper School expansions, the systematic development of Upper School experiential education programming and growth in the number of Durham Academy athletic teams to twice their size.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Durham Academy parent Gary Hock donated a 6,000-square foot building to house computer classrooms and a computer library.\n\nIn August 2002, Durham Academy's Preschool and Lower School moved to 17 acres on the Ridge Road campus. The building opened has been recognized by the [[Chicago Athenaeum]]: Museum of Architecture and Design for its unique style.<ref>{{cite web |title=American Architecture Awards |publisher=Chicago Anthenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design |url=http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/archawards/2004/lowerschooldurham.html |accessdate=2006-12-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008221108/http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/archawards/2004/lowerschooldurham.html |archivedate=2006-10-08 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the school was ranked first in the Southeast by the New York Times and 30th in the nation by Forbes.\n\nDuring the 2008-2009 school year, Durham Academy celebrated its 75th anniversary.\n\nThe Upper School Learning Commons opened in February 2012. The 7,000-square-foot building includes a library, college counseling, a student store, a faculty work room, and a computer lab with 20 iMac stations. The building also houses classroom and office space.<ref>{{cite news|title=A new 'heart and soul' at Durham Academy |url=http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/17519810/article-A-new-%E2%80%98heart-and-soul%E2%80%99-at-Durham-Academy |accessdate=1 November 2012 |newspaper=Durham Herald-Sun }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe Upper School Kirby Gym opened in January 2013.

The couple established the school as a private, independent school to educate their children. The school's teaching philosophy (and its name) were based on the Calvert School in Baltimore, Maryland, which Ann McCollough Hill attended as a child. The Calvert Method School's first home was in Durham's [[Forest Hills Historic District (Durham, North Carolina)|Forest Hills neighborhood]], with the neighborhood's clubhouse serving as a classroom for seven students and one teacher.\n\nIn 1937, the Calvert Method School moved to [[John Sprunt Hill]]'s former home at 815 S. Duke Street.\n\nIn 1959, the school ended its affiliation with Baltimore's Calvert School and changed its name to Durham Academy. Durham Academy also became a member of the National Council of Independent Schools and added an eighth grade.\n\nIn May 1965, Durham Academy broke ground on a new campus on Highway 751 (later named Academy Road). Students and teachers moved into the new facility in March 1966.\n\nDurham Academy added to the Academy Road campus during the early 1970s. Plans for a starting high school were also explored.\n\nIn 1971, Durham Academy purchased and broke ground on 42 acres of land on Ridge Road to launch the Upper School. The Upper School opened in September 1973, and Durham Academy's first senior class graduated in June 1975. George Watts Hill and Frank Hawkins Kenan were both instrumental in the creation of Durham Academy's Upper School. Kenan, whose children had attended Calvert Method School and later Durham Academy, made an anonymous gift of $1 million to build the Upper School campus. George Watts Hill established an endowment for Durham Academy, to which Kenan later contributed nearly $3 million.\n\nIn 1977, George Watts Hill, Fred Brooks and Bill Friday founded the Learning Development Center (now known as The Hill Center), for children with learning differences. The LDC, located on Durham Academy's Ridge Road campus, had a close relationship with Durham Academy, but had its own faculty and a separate facility for its 13 students and four teachers. The Hill Center currently operates as an affiliate of Durham Academy in its facility on Pickett Rd. The center's focus is on intensive remediation and tutoring for students with learning differences and training teachers to help students with learning differences.\n\nBy 1978 Durham Academy had grown to 795 students in grades K-12. From the late 1970s to early 1980s the school developed an honor code, a Cum Laude Society, a faculty summer grants program and established an excellence in teaching award named after then-headmaster F. Robertson Hershey.\n\nIn 1983, Durham Academy celebrated its 50th anniversary with ceremonies led by founder George Watts Hill.\n\nIn 1986, the school added to the Academy Road campus with a new library/arts/science building. That same year, Durham Academy began hosting the Durham County Special Olympics, which includes an estimated 400 athletes from all Durham County Public Schools. Upper School students and faculty plan the annual event. The entire Upper School closes on the day of the games so that students and faculty can all volunteer and host the athletes.\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s saw major Middle School and Upper School expansions, the systematic development of Upper School experiential education programming and growth in the number of Durham Academy athletic teams to twice their size.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Durham Academy parent Gary Hock donated a 6,000-square foot building to house computer classrooms and a computer library.\n\nIn August 2002, Durham Academy's Preschool and Lower School moved to 17 acres on the Ridge Road campus. The building opened has been recognized by the [[Chicago Athenaeum]]: Museum of Architecture and Design for its unique style.<ref>{{cite web |title=American Architecture Awards |publisher=Chicago Anthenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design |url=http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/archawards/2004/lowerschooldurham.html |accessdate=2006-12-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008221108/http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/archawards/2004/lowerschooldurham.html |archivedate=2006-10-08 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the school was ranked first in the Southeast by the New York Times and 30th in the nation by Forbes.\n\nDuring the 2008-2009 school year, Durham Academy celebrated its 75th anniversary.\n\nThe Upper School Learning Commons opened in February 2012.

Tanjiro is a teenager who goes on a quest to restore the humanity of his sister, [[Nezuko Kamado|Nezuko]], who was turned into a demon after his family was killed by Muzan Kibutsuji. After an encounter with [[Giyu Tomioka]], a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyu to also become a demon slayer to help his sister turn human again and avenge his family. Besides the ''Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba'' [[anime]] adaptation, Tanjiro has also appeared in a [[light novel]] that acts as a prequel to the manga.\n \nKoyoharu Got\u014dge created Tanjiro following a suggestion from his editor of having a bright main character who would stand out in his dark narrative. His design influenced by [[Himura Kenshin]] from [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' when deciding how andrognynous the character should look. In the anime series, Tanjiro is voiced by [[Natsuki Hanae]] in Japanese and Zach Aguilar in English. The character has been well received by manga and anime critics due to his caring nature and relationship with his sister, winning multiple awards based on his popularity.\n\n==Creation and design==\n[[File:NezukoTanjiroearlysketch.jpg|thumb|left|Early sketches of Nezuko and Tanjiro]]\nTanjiro Kamado originates from Koyoharu Got\u014dge's ideas involving a one-shot with Japanese motifs. Tatsuhiko Katayama, his editor, was worried about the one-shot being too dark for the young demographic and asked Got\u014dge if he could write another type of main character who would be \"brighter\".<ref name=\"creation\">{{cite web|url=https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/web_pages/234/|title=The birth of \"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\"|publisher=Shueisha|website=Manga Plus|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> Got\u014dge has cited issues in the making of the character due to the contrast he has with the dark narrative. For the release of the manga's seventh chapter, Got\u014dge drew a cover of Tanjiro wielding his sword while smiling. However, due to the constrating aesthetics the manga had. As a result, Got\u014dge discarded the drawing and instead drew a similar design with Tanjiro having a serious expression.<ref>{{cite book|title=Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba|volume=2|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-9747-0053-0|year=2018|author=Got\u014dge, Koyoharu}}</ref>\n\nIn the initial design, Tanjiro did not have a scar or wear earrings, but in the end they felt these features really accentuated the character. In the making of the cast, Tanjiro had four supporting characters who would balance each other due to their different skills. The editor commented about Tanjiro, \"[He] is a type of male main character that you don't really see much. He's so kind. He has Nezuko, so he's coming from this position where he can't just say all demons are absolute evil. He's in the gray zone.\" Tanjiro's design was also influenced by Got\u014dge's editor: He suggested giving Tanjiro a facial scar in his forehead inspired by [[Himura Kenshin]] from [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' while also giving him earrings in order to balance how androgynous he would look.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nYuma Takahashi, the producer behind the adaptation of the manga said he enjoyed Tanjiro's role in the manga, making him engaged in reading the series. For how Tanjiro's Water Breathing was portrayed, [[Ufotable]] received inspiration from [[Katsushika Hokusai]]'s [[ukiyo-e]] style. The first fight scene between Tanjiro and Giyu was also carefully animated to give viewers an appealing choreography.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/es-es/anime-feature/2019/08/16/yuma-takahashi-talks-about-producing-one-of-animes-biggest-hits?referrer=community_cr_twitter_news|title=Yuma Takahashi Talks About Producing One of Anime's Biggest Hits!|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> Tanjiro's water-based techniques were created using a mix between hand-drawn animation and CGI, while his battle against Rui was one of the most worked scenes in the making. Takahashi also said that Tanjiro is his most relatable character from the series due to how his constant hard work inspires him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2019-08-28/interview-demon-slayer-producer-yuma-takahashi/.149177|title=Interview: Demon Slayer producer Yuma Takahashi|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhen the anime series premiered in China, Tanjiro's design was sightly altered. Due to his piercings having Rising Sun style elements, it was feared it would offend the Mainland leading to brief retouches to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/anime-demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-changed-slightly-a-1833879190|title=Anime Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Changed Slightly In China As Not To Offend|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice actors ===\nTanjiro has been voiced by [[Natsuki Hanae]] in Japanese. Hanae noted that multiple response to his career involved him portraying sad characters. However, in Tanjiro's case, he said Tanjiro is on the easy side because he says what he thinks, and is not the type that thinks one way and other things. Nezuko's actress, [[Akari Kit\u014d]], said Hanae is like a big brother to her at the studio, supportive and if there are parts she has difficulty recording, Hanae would stay and wait till she finishes even though his part has finished. Hanae said she also thinks of Kit\u014d as a younger sister. He also says it is easier for him to do his best when he is around people who he is friendly with.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/comic/pp/kimetsu|title=\u300c\u9b3c\u6ec5\u306e\u5203\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f|publisher=Ntalie|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEnglish voice actor Zach Aguilar was overjoyed when being given the role of voicing Tanjiro in the dub due to him being a fan of the series, as well as noting he was supported by multiple fans.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Zach Aguilar|user=airzach\n|number=1182014282487042048 |date=October 9, 2019 |title=Incredibly honored by this - I\u2019m voicing Tanjiro for the English dub of Demon Slayer!

His skull is extremely thick and his headbutts are often used as gags throughout the series. He is a kind-hearted boy and often feels sympathy for demons and their victims. His endless optimism and simple nature often has people enjoy his company, but at the same time, it also puts him at odds with certain personalities. Tanjiro has a heightened sense of smell which allows him to track down demons and evade their attacks. His sword's color is black, occasionally turning crimson red and becoming much stronger when combined with Nezuko's Blood Burst, a technique he later learns to perform without her help.\n\nA [[light novel]] entitled ''Demon Slayer: Flower of Happiness'' chronicles the lives of Tanjiro and Zenitsu before the start of the main series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kimetsu.com/news/?id=49766|script-title=ja:\u300c\u9b3c\u6ec5\u306e\u5203\u300d\u516c\u5f0f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|website=kimetsu.com|url-status=live|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Merchandising based on Tanjiro has also been released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otakuusamagazine.com/posable-demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-figure-can/|title=Posable Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Figure Can Do It All|website=Otaku USA|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otakuusamagazine.com/sony-demon-slayer-yaiba-walkman/|title=Sony Releases Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Walkman, Headphones|website=Otaku USA|access-date=February 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical===\nCritical reception to Tanjiro's character has been positive ever since his introduction.

Tanjiro is a teenager who goes on a quest to restore the humanity of his sister, [[Nezuko Kamado|Nezuko]], who was turned into a demon after his family was killed by Muzan Kibutsuji. After an encounter with [[Giyu Tomioka]], a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyu to also become a demon slayer to help his sister turn human again and avenge his family. Besides the ''Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba'' [[anime]] adaptation, Tanjiro has also appeared in a [[light novel]] that acts as a prequel to the manga.\n \nKoyoharu Got\u014dge created Tanjiro following a suggestion from his editor of having a bright main character who would stand out in his dark narrative. His design influenced by [[Himura Kenshin]] from [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' when deciding how andrognynous the character should look. In the anime series, Tanjiro is voiced by [[Natsuki Hanae]] in Japanese and Zach Aguilar in English. The character has been well received by manga and anime critics due to his caring nature and relationship with his sister, winning multiple awards based on his popularity.\n\n==Creation and design==\n[[File:NezukoTanjiroearlysketch.jpg|thumb|left|Early sketches of Nezuko and Tanjiro]]\nTanjiro Kamado originates from Koyoharu Got\u014dge's ideas involving a one-shot with Japanese motifs. Tatsuhiko Katayama, his editor, was worried about the one-shot being too dark for the young demographic and asked Got\u014dge if he could write another type of main character who would be \"brighter\".<ref name=\"creation\">{{cite web|url=https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/web_pages/234/|title=The birth of \"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\"|publisher=Shueisha|website=Manga Plus|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> Got\u014dge has cited issues in the making of the character due to the contrast he has with the dark narrative. For the release of the manga's seventh chapter, Got\u014dge drew a cover of Tanjiro wielding his sword while smiling. However, due to the constrating aesthetics the manga had. As a result, Got\u014dge discarded the drawing and instead drew a similar design with Tanjiro having a serious expression.<ref>{{cite book|title=Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba|volume=2|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-9747-0053-0|year=2018|author=Got\u014dge, Koyoharu}}</ref>\n\nIn the initial design, Tanjiro did not have a scar or wear earrings, but in the end they felt these features really accentuated the character. In the making of the cast, Tanjiro had four supporting characters who would balance each other due to their different skills. The editor commented about Tanjiro, \"[He] is a type of male main character that you don't really see much. He's so kind. He has Nezuko, so he's coming from this position where he can't just say all demons are absolute evil. He's in the gray zone.\" Tanjiro's design was also influenced by Got\u014dge's editor: He suggested giving Tanjiro a facial scar in his forehead inspired by [[Himura Kenshin]] from [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' while also giving him earrings in order to balance how androgynous he would look.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nYuma Takahashi, the producer behind the adaptation of the manga said he enjoyed Tanjiro's role in the manga, making him engaged in reading the series. For how Tanjiro's Water Breathing was portrayed, [[Ufotable]] received inspiration from [[Katsushika Hokusai]]'s [[ukiyo-e]] style. The first fight scene between Tanjiro and Giyu was also carefully animated to give viewers an appealing choreography.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/es-es/anime-feature/2019/08/16/yuma-takahashi-talks-about-producing-one-of-animes-biggest-hits?referrer=community_cr_twitter_news|title=Yuma Takahashi Talks About Producing One of Anime's Biggest Hits!|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> Tanjiro's water-based techniques were created using a mix between hand-drawn animation and CGI, while his battle against Rui was one of the most worked scenes in the making. Takahashi also said that Tanjiro is his most relatable character from the series due to how his constant hard work inspires him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2019-08-28/interview-demon-slayer-producer-yuma-takahashi/.149177|title=Interview: Demon Slayer producer Yuma Takahashi|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhen the anime series premiered in China, Tanjiro's design was sightly altered. Due to his piercings having Rising Sun style elements, it was feared it would offend the Mainland leading to brief retouches to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/anime-demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-changed-slightly-a-1833879190|title=Anime Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Changed Slightly In China As Not To Offend|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice actors ===\nTanjiro has been voiced by [[Natsuki Hanae]] in Japanese. Hanae noted that multiple response to his career involved him portraying sad characters. However, in Tanjiro's case, he said Tanjiro is on the easy side because he says what he thinks, and is not the type that thinks one way and other things. Nezuko's actress, [[Akari Kit\u014d]], said Hanae is like a big brother to her at the studio, supportive and if there are parts she has difficulty recording, Hanae would stay and wait till she finishes even though his part has finished. Hanae said she also thinks of Kit\u014d as a younger sister. He also says it is easier for him to do his best when he is around people who he is friendly with.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/comic/pp/kimetsu|title=\u300c\u9b3c\u6ec5\u306e\u5203\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f|publisher=Ntalie|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEnglish voice actor Zach Aguilar was overjoyed when being given the role of voicing Tanjiro in the dub due to him being a fan of the series, as well as noting he was supported by multiple fans.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Zach Aguilar|user=airzach\n|number=1182014282487042048 |date=October 9, 2019 |title=Incredibly honored by this - I\u2019m voicing Tanjiro for the English dub of Demon Slayer!

His skull is extremely thick and his headbutts are often used as gags throughout the series. He is a kind-hearted boy and often feels sympathy for demons and their victims. His endless optimism and simple nature often has people enjoy his company, but at the same time, it also puts him at odds with certain personalities. Tanjiro has a heightened sense of smell which allows him to track down demons and evade their attacks. His sword's color is black, occasionally turning crimson red and becoming much stronger when combined with Nezuko's Blood Burst, a technique he later learns to perform without her help.\n\nA [[light novel]] entitled ''Demon Slayer: Flower of Happiness'' chronicles the lives of Tanjiro and Zenitsu before the start of the main series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kimetsu.com/news/?id=49766|script-title=ja:\u300c\u9b3c\u6ec5\u306e\u5203\u300d\u516c\u5f0f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|website=kimetsu.com|url-status=live|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Merchandising based on Tanjiro has also been released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otakuusamagazine.com/posable-demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-figure-can/|title=Posable Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Figure Can Do It All|website=Otaku USA|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otakuusamagazine.com/sony-demon-slayer-yaiba-walkman/|title=Sony Releases Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Walkman, Headphones|website=Otaku USA|access-date=February 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical===\nCritical reception to Tanjiro's character has been positive ever since his introduction.
