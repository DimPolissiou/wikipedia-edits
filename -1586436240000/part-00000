Argentina had had a goal difference of +2, but in its last group match, it defeated Peru 6\u20130, and thus qualified for the final in a match accused of ultimately-unproven [[match fixing]]. The [[Brazil at the 1978 FIFA World Cup#Starting 11|Brazilian team]] qualified for the third place, and were the only team to remain unbeaten in the tournament.\n\nAt the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]], held in Spain, Brazil were the tournament favorites, and easily moved through the early part of the draw, but a [[Brazil vs Italy (1982)|3\u20132 defeat]] in Barcelona to Italy, in a classic World Cup match, eliminated them from the tournament in the match that they refer to as \"Sarri\u00e1's Disaster\", referencing the stadium's name.

The game played to a 1\u20131 draw in regulation time, and after a goalless extra time, it all came down to a penalty shoot-out, where Brazil was defeated 4\u20133.

The game played to a 1\u20131 draw in regulation time, and after a goalless extra time, it all came down to a penalty shoot-out, where Brazil was defeated 4\u20133. After 40 years, Brazil was victorious in the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], this being their fourth victory in four tournaments hosted in Brazil. This achievement ended a 19-year streak without official titles for the Brazilians.

Kevork Chavush was known to have [[Kurdish-Armenian relations|good relations]] with some [[Kurdistan|Kurdish]] leaders of the region. He would openly meet and dine with them and at the same time, try to persuade them to not obey orders by the Sultan, who had hired the [[Kurds]] as part of his [[Hamidieh soldier|Hamidieh]] guards.

Two days later his body was found in Kyosabin-Bashin on 27 May under a bridge. Kevork Chavush remained a leading Armenian guerrilla until his death.

He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business. While at Northwestern, he invested $750 in the Broadway musical ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]].

Carr worked behind the scenes at ''[[Playboy]]'' with [[Hugh Hefner]] and was a co-creator of the ''Playboy Penthouse'' television series, which in turn launched the [[Playboy Club]]s.\n\nThrough the years, he became known as a great planner of promotional events and parties.

The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for Worst Film, in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced a musical version of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''Goya...A Life in Song'' with Freddie Gershon and CBS Records, a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].

He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business. While at Northwestern, he invested $750 in the Broadway musical ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Though the show was not a hit, he had also invested $1,250 in 1967's ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]],'' which gave him the success he needed to leave school and embark upon a career in entertainment.\n\nIn Chicago in the 1960s, he opened the Civic Theater and financed ''[[The World of Carl Sandburg]]'' starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Gary Merrill]], as well as [[Eva Le Gallienne]] in ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]],'' directed by Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''Garden District'', featuring [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] and [[Diana Barrymore]]. Carr worked behind the scenes at ''[[Playboy]]'' with [[Hugh Hefner]] and was a co-creator of the ''Playboy Penthouse'' television series, which in turn launched the [[Playboy Club]]s.\n\nThrough the years, he became known as a great planner of promotional events and parties. One such event, a black-tie affair for [[Truman Capote]], took place in an abandoned Los Angeles jail.<ref name=Y>{{cite web|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/allan-carr-rise-fall-hollywood-hedonist-014130665.html|title=Allan Carr: The rise and fall of a Hollywood hedonist|author=Taggart, Frankie|date=May 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Management career==\nIn 1966, Carr founded the talent agency Allan Carr Enterprises, managing the actors [[Tony Curtis]], [[Peter Sellers]],<ref name=Y/> [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Melina Mercouri]], and [[Marlo Thomas]].  Some of the other entertainment figures whose careers he managed were [[Ann-Margret]], a string of whose television specials he also produced, [[Nancy Walker]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Peggy Lee]], \"Mama\" [[Cass Elliot]],<ref name=Y/> [[Paul Anka]], [[Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons]], [[George Maharis]], and [[Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass]].\n\nCarr is also credited for having discovered numerous celebrities, including some such, who also became his clients, as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/96824/Allan-Carr Allan Carr \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Steve Guttenberg]],<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/arts/allan-carr-62-the-producer-of-grease-and-la-cage.html|work=The New York Times|title=Allan Carr, 62, the Producer Of 'Grease' and 'La Cage'|date=July 1, 1999|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> and [[Lisa Hartman]].<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n==''Grease'' and Broadway success==\nProducer [[Robert Stigwood]] hired him in 1975 as marketing and promotion consultant, with his first project being for the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film version]] of the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The film was a hit and he expanded his involvement for his next film, re-editing and overdubbing a low-budget foreign film about a real-life disaster. The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Award]]s and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for Worst Film, in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced a musical version of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars.

The book is written from the mind of a dog, which makes every-day events very strange (a church clock becomes a \"time-gun\", for example). The main story of the book is directly adapted from the true Scottish story of [[Greyfriars Bobby]].\n\nBobby spends much time with his master and unofficial owner, \"Auld Jock\" ([[Scots]] for \"Old John\"), creating a very strong emotional connection. Though Jock never bought Bobby, they had an intense connection and Jock cared for Bobby very well. This creates problems later, because of Jock's having, in the eyes of the law, \"stolen\" an unlicensed dog. Eventually, Auld Jock dies. Bobby is obviously in great distress - but a loyal dog will never leave its owner's side, even after death.\n\nWhen his owner died, Bobby was lost - he could barely function without his companion. Since his owner's body was identified as John Gray and not Auld Jock, people still told Bobby to look for Jock, which just made the pain for Bobby worse. Bobby is lost for a while, and a large reward is offered for his return. Eventually, Bobby found his owner's grave and guarded it day and night - the pair is inseparable.<ref name=\"text\">{{cite web |last1=Atkinson |first1=Eleanor |title=Greyfriar's Bobby Text |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2693/2693-h/2693-h.htm |website=The Project Gutenberg EBook of Greyfriars Bobby, by Eleanor Atkinson |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=13 February 2019 |ref=1}}</ref><ref name=\"lizzy\">{{cite web |last1=Siddal |first1=Lizzy |title=Greyfriars Bobby \u2013 Eleanor Atkinson |url=https://lizzysiddal.wordpress.com/2010/08/17/greyfriars-bobby-eleanor-atkinson/ |website=Lizzy\u2019s Literary Life |accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n'''Bobby''' \n\nBobby is a Skye terrier from a heathery slope of the [[Pentland Hills]].<ref name=\"text\"/>\n\n'''Auld Jock'''\n\nAuld Jock is Bobby's owner.<ref name=\"text\"/>\n\nJock is Scottish for John, Auld is old so Old John.\n\n'''Mr. John Traill'''\n\nMr. John Traill is the owner of Ye Olde Greyfriars Dining-Rooms and a landlord.<ref name=\"text\"/>\n\n'''Sergeant Scott'''\n\nSergeant Scott is an officer of the Royal Engineers.<ref name=\"text\"/>\n\n'''Private McLean'''\n\nPrivate McLean is Sergeant Scott's private.

Prior to this 1912 novel, there were many conflicting accounts of the legend, due to inconsistencies being passed down through generations of Scottish families. [[Eleanor Atkinson]]'s novel served as a standardization and popularization of the story in the [[United States]]. Interestingly, Eleanor Atkinson had never stepped foot in Scotland in her life, but wrote extremely detailed depictions of landscapes of the region, implying that she was very familiar with the region through extensive research. Atkinson also very accurately depicts Scottish dialogue, a feat that suggests she wrote the book with the help of Scottish immigrants to the Midwest.<ref name=\"junior\">{{cite book |last1=Kunitz |first1=Stanley |editor1-last=Haycraft |editor1-first=Howard |title=The Junior Book of Authors: An Introduction to the Lives of Writers and Illustrators for Younger Readers, from Lewis Carroll and Louisa Alcott to the Present Day |date=1934 |publisher=H.W.

Atkinson discusses how this is a result of the book being passed down from adults to their children, finding its way into schools' reading lists.

The book is written from the mind of a dog, which makes every-day events very strange. The book references a church clock as a \"time-gun\", for example. The main story of the book is directly adapted from the true Scottish story of [[Greyfriars Bobby]]. Bobby spends a lot of time with his (unofficial) owner, Auld Jock (Scottish familiar name for Old John), creating a very strong emotional connection. Though Jock never bought Bobby, they had an intense connection and Jock cared for Bobby very well. This creates problems later due to the legality of Jocks's 'stealing' an unlicensed dog. Eventually, Auld Jock dies. Bobby is obviously in great distress - but a loyal dog will never leave their owner's side, even after death. When his owner died, Bobby was lost - he could barely function without his companion. Since his owner's body was identified as John Gray and not Auld Jock, people still told Bobby to look for Jock, which just made the pain for Bobby worse. Bobby is lost for a while, and a large reward is offered for his return Eventually, Bobby found his owner's grave and guarded it day and night - the pair is inseparable.<ref name=\"text\">{{cite web |last1=Atkinson |first1=Eleanor |title=Greyfriar's Bobby Text |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2693/2693-h/2693-h.htm |website=The Project Gutenberg EBook of Greyfriars Bobby, by Eleanor Atkinson |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=13 February 2019 |ref=1}}</ref><ref name=\"lizzy\">{{cite web |last1=Siddal |first1=Lizzy |title=Greyfriars Bobby \u2013 Eleanor Atkinson |url=https://lizzysiddal.wordpress.com/2010/08/17/greyfriars-bobby-eleanor-atkinson/ |website=Lizzy\u2019s Literary Life |accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n'''Bobby''' \n\nBobby is a Skye terrier from a heathery slope of the [[Pentland Hills]].<ref name=\"text\"/>\n\n'''Auld Jock'''\n\nAuld Jock is Bobby's owner.<ref name=\"text\"/>\n\nJock is Scottish for John, Auld is old so Old John.\n\n'''Mr. John Traill'''\n\nMr. John Traill is the owner of Ye Olde Greyfriars Dining-Rooms and a landlord.<ref name=\"text\"/>\n\n'''Sergeant Scott'''\n\nSergeant Scott is an officer of the Royal Engineers.<ref name=\"text\"/>\n\n'''Private McLean'''\n\nPrivate McLean is Sergeant Scott's private.

Prior to this 1912 novel, there were many conflicting accounts of the legend, due to inconsistencies being passed down through generations of Scottish families. [[Eleanor Atkinson]]'s novel served as a standardization and popularization of the story in the [[United States]]. Interestingly, Eleanor Atkinson had never stepped foot in Scotland in her life, but wrote extremely detailed depictions of landscapes of the region, implying that she was very familiar with the region through extensive research. Atkinson also very accurately depicts Scottish dialogue, a feat that suggests she wrote the book with the help of Scottish immigrants to the Midwest.<ref name=\"junior\">{{cite book |last1=Kunitz |first1=Stanley |editor1-last=Haycraft |editor1-first=Howard |title=The Junior Book of Authors: An Introduction to the Lives of Writers and Illustrators for Younger Readers, from Lewis Carroll and Louisa Alcott to the Present Day |date=1934 |publisher=H.W.

Atkinson discusses how this is a result of the book being passed down from adults to their children, finding its way into schools' reading lists. She says the book was not written with a young audience in mind, and she credits this lack of simplification for younger audiences with the success of her work.<ref name='junior'></ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{wikisource|Greyfriar's Bobby|''Greyfriar's Bobby''}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1912 American novels]]\n[[Category:American novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Novels about animals]]\n", "name_user": "Firstorm", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:Errors of grammar (\"a dog ... their\") and vocabulary (\"very unique\" -- \"unique\" is an absolute, not a synonym for \"unusual\" or \"rare\") corrected, infelicitous language modified.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyfriars_Bobby_(novel)"}

The language is also spoken by the [[Tokaleya|Iwe, Toka and Leya people]], and perhaps by the [[Kafwe Twa]] (if they are not [[Ila language|Ila]]), as well as many bilingual Zambians and Zimbabweans.

In Clements, G. N. and John Goldsmith ''Autosegmental Studies in Bantu Tone''. Dordrecht, Foris Publications, p. 48.</ref> Several scholars, beginning with [[A. E. Meeussen]] in 1963,<ref>Meeussen, A.E. (1963) \"Morphotonology of the Tonga Verb\", ''Journal of African Linguistics'' Vol.2, Part I.</ref> have tried to discover the rules for where to place the tones. \n\nOne feature of the tonal system is that high tones tend to get disassociated from their original place and move to the left, as is illustrated in these examples:<ref>Pulleyblank (1983) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/36089880_Tone_in_lexical_phonology ''Tone in Lexical Phonology''], Massachusetts Institute of Technology, p. 191.</ref>\n*'''''\u00ed'''b'''\u00fa'''si'' 'smoke'\n*''ibusu'' 'flour'\n\nIn these words, the original high tone of the root ''-s\u00ed'' has moved to the prefix ''ibu-'', whereas the low tone of ''-su'' has not affected the prefix.\n\nThe above example of a noun is relatively easy to explain. However, the tones of the verbal system are more complex. An example of one of the puzzles discussed by both [[A. E. Meeussen|Meeussen]] and [[John Goldsmith (linguist)|Goldsmith]] can be seen below:\n\n*''ndi-la-lang-a'' 'I look at'\n*''ba-la-lang-a'' 'they look at'\n*''ndi-la-bon-a'' 'I see'\n*''ba-l'''\u00e1'''-bon-a'' 'they see'\n\nThe high tone on the tense-marker ''la'' in the fourth verb is puzzling. If it comes from the verb root ''bon'', it is hard to see why it does not also appear in the 1st person ''ndi-la-bon-a''. \n\nSome scholars, such as [[Hazel Carter (linguist)|Carter]]<ref>Carter, Hazel (1971) and (1972). \"Morphotonology of Zambian Tonga: Some Developments of Meeussen's System\". ''African Language Studies'' 12: 1-30 and 14: 36-52.</ref> and [[John Goldsmith (linguist)|Goldsmith]],<ref name=Gold /> have analysed Tonga as having both tones and accents (the accents in Tonga being mainly on low-toned syllables).

Masson is best known for his conclusions about [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. In his ''[[The Assault on Truth]]'' (1984), Masson argues that Freud may have abandoned his [[Freud's seduction theory|seduction theory]] because he feared that granting the truth of his female patients' claims (that they had been [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]]) would hinder the acceptance of his [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] methods. Masson is a [[veganism]] advocate and has written about [[animal rights]].<ref name=Jeff>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffreymasson.com/about.html |title=About Jeff |publisher=Jeffreymasson.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref>\n\n== Life and career ==\nJeffrey Masson is the son of Jacques Masson, a Frenchman of [[Bukharian Jew|Bukharian]] ancestry, and Diana (Dina) Zeiger from an [[Ashkenazi]] strict [[Orthodox Jew]]ish family. Both of his parents were followers of the [[guru]] [[Paul Brunton]].<ref name=\"NY\"/> Masson's mother later became a follower of [[Mysticism|mystic]] [[John Levy (philosopher)|John Levy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ods.nl/am1gos/am1gos5/index.html?jl_vriend_us.html~mainFrame |title=John Levy: friend and contrary guru |publisher=Ods.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref> During the 1940s and 1950s, Brunton often lived with them, eventually designating Masson as his [[heir apparent]]. In 1956, Diana and Jacques Masson moved to [[Uruguay]] because Brunton believed that a [[World War III|third world war]] was imminent. Jeffrey and his sister Linda followed in 1959.\n\nAt Brunton's urging, Masson went to [[Harvard University]] to study [[Sanskrit]]. While at Harvard, Masson became disillusioned with Brunton. Brunton and his influence on the Masson family form the subject of Masson's autobiographical book ''My Father's Guru: A Journey Through Spirituality and Disillusion''. [[Harvard University]] granted Masson a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1964 and a [[Ph.D.]] with Honors in 1970. His degrees were in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Indian Studies]]. While undertaking his Ph.D., Masson also studied, supported by fellowships, at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris, the [[University of Calcutta]], and the [[University of Poona]].\n\nMasson taught Sanskrit and Indian Studies at the [[University of Toronto]], 1969\u201380, reaching the rank of Professor. He has also held short term appointments at [[Brown University]], the [[University of California]], and the [[University of Michigan]]. From 1981 to 1992, he was a Research Associate, Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He is currently an Honorary Fellow in the Department of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Auckland]] in New Zealand.\n\n== Views on Freud's seduction theory ==\nIn 1970, Masson began studying to become a psychoanalyst at the Toronto Psychoanalytic Institute, completing a full clinical training course in 1978. His training analyst was Irvine Schiffer, a well-known Toronto analyst and author of books on the unconscious aspects of charisma and time. In 1990 Masson published an autobiographical book in which he accused Schiffer of cursing, being constantly late for sessions, and intimidating Masson when the latter complained about this issue.<ref name=\"Final Analysis\">{{cite book |last=Masson |first=Jeffrey |year=1990 |title=Final Analysis: The Making and Unmaking of a Psychoanalyst |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-52368-X}}</ref> Schiffer denied it and debated Masson on the Canadian television program ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=61MAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40 | title=Love is Strange | publisher=([[Google Books]]) | work=[[New York Magazine]] | date=March 22, 1993 | accessdate=November 14, 2012 | author=Smith, Dinitia}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Masson befriended the psychoanalyst [[Kurt Eissler]] and became acquainted with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s daughter [[Anna Freud]]. Eissler designated Masson to succeed him as Director of the [[Sigmund Freud Archives]] after his and Anna Freud's death. Masson learned [[German language|German]] and studied the [[history of psychoanalysis]]. In 1980 Masson was appointed Projects Director of the Freud Archives, with full access to Freud's correspondence and other unpublished papers. While perusing this material, Masson concluded that Freud might have rejected the seduction theory in order to advance the cause of [[psychoanalysis]] and to maintain his own place within the psychoanalytic inner circle, after a hostile response from the renowned sex-pathologist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] and the rest of the Vienna Psychiatric Society in 1896 - \"an icy reception from the jackasses,\" was the way Freud described it later to Fliess\n<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9A0CEFDA123BF936A1575BC0A967948260 \"Did Freud's Isolation Lead Him to Reverse Theory on Neurosis?\"] by Ralph Blumenthal, ''[[New York Times]]'', August 25, 1981</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Masson's controversial conclusions were discussed in a series of ''[[New York Times]]'' articles by Ralph Blumenthal, to the dismay of the psychoanalytic establishment. Masson was subsequently dismissed from his position as project director of the Freud Archives and stripped of his membership in psychoanalytic professional societies. Masson was defended by [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]]<ref>PSYCHOLOGIE HEUTE, April 1987, P.21, 22: \"Im Gegensatz zu manchen Interpreten, die, wie zum Beispiel Marianne Kr\u00fcll, Marie Balmary oder Jeffrey Masson, Freuds Abkehr von der Wahrheit als Folge seiner Familiengeschichte deuten, sehe ich diesen Schritt als Folge und Ausdruck unserer jahrtausendealten kinderfeindlichen Tradition, in der wir auch heute noch leben. Die Ergebnisse der oben genannten historischen Forscher k\u00f6nnen trotzdem korrekt sein, aber ich meine, da\u00df es Freud trotz der pers\u00f6nlichen Familiengeschichte m\u00f6glich gewesen w\u00e4re, seiner Entdeckung treu zu bleiben, wenn die Gesellschaft als Ganzes nicht so kinderfeindlich gewesen w\u00e4re, wenn schon damals andere, freiere Erziehungsmuster denkbar gewesen w\u00e4ren.

In the introduction to ''The Assault on Truth'', Masson challenged his critics to address his arguments: \"My pessimistic conclusions may possibly be wrong.

Masson is best known for his conclusions about [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. In his ''[[The Assault on Truth]]'' (1984), Masson argues that Freud may have abandoned his [[Freud's seduction theory|seduction theory]] because he feared that granting the truth of his female patients' claims (that they had been [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]]) would hinder the acceptance of his [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] methods. Masson is a [[veganism]] advocate and has written about [[animal rights]].<ref name=Jeff>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffreymasson.com/about.html |title=About Jeff |publisher=Jeffreymasson.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref>\n\n== Life and career ==\nJeffrey Masson is the son of Jacques Masson, a Frenchman of [[Bukharian Jew|Bukharian]] ancestry, and Diana (Dina) Zeiger from an [[Ashkenazi]] strict [[Orthodox Jew]]ish family. Both of his parents were followers of the [[guru]] [[Paul Brunton]].<ref name=\"NY\"/> Masson's mother later became a follower of [[Mysticism|mystic]] [[John Levy (philosopher)|John Levy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ods.nl/am1gos/am1gos5/index.html?jl_vriend_us.html~mainFrame |title=John Levy: friend and contrary guru |publisher=Ods.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref> During the 1940s and 1950s, Brunton often lived with them, eventually designating Masson as his [[heir apparent]]. In 1956, Diana and Jacques Masson moved to [[Uruguay]] because Brunton believed that a [[World War III|third world war]] was imminent. Jeffrey and his sister Linda followed in 1959.\n\nAt Brunton's urging, Masson went to [[Harvard University]] to study [[Sanskrit]]. While at Harvard, Masson became disillusioned with Brunton. Brunton and his influence on the Masson family form the subject of Masson's autobiographical book ''My Father's Guru: A Journey Through Spirituality and Disillusion''. [[Harvard University]] granted Masson a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1964 and a [[Ph.D.]] with Honors in 1970. His degrees were in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Indian Studies]]. While undertaking his Ph.D., Masson also studied, supported by fellowships, at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris, the [[University of Calcutta]], and the [[University of Poona]].\n\nMasson taught Sanskrit and Indian Studies at the [[University of Toronto]], 1969\u201380, reaching the rank of Professor. He has also held short term appointments at [[Brown University]], the [[University of California]], and the [[University of Michigan]]. From 1981 to 1992, he was a Research Associate, Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He is currently an Honorary Fellow in the Department of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Auckland]] in New Zealand.\n\n== Views on Freud's seduction theory ==\nIn 1970, Masson began studying to become a psychoanalyst at the Toronto Psychoanalytic Institute, completing a full clinical training course in 1978. His training analyst was Irvine Schiffer, a well-known Toronto analyst and author of books on the unconscious aspects of charisma and time. In 1990 Masson published an autobiographical book in which he accused Schiffer of cursing, being constantly late for sessions, and intimidating Masson when the latter complained about this issue.<ref name=\"Final Analysis\">{{cite book |last=Masson |first=Jeffrey |year=1990 |title=Final Analysis: The Making and Unmaking of a Psychoanalyst |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-52368-X}}</ref> Schiffer denied it and debated Masson on the Canadian television program ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=61MAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40 | title=Love is Strange | publisher=([[Google Books]]) | work=[[New York Magazine]] | date=March 22, 1993 | accessdate=November 14, 2012 | author=Smith, Dinitia}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Masson befriended the psychoanalyst [[Kurt Eissler]] and became acquainted with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s daughter [[Anna Freud]]. Eissler designated Masson to succeed him as Director of the [[Sigmund Freud Archives]] after his and Anna Freud's death. Masson learned [[German language|German]] and studied the [[history of psychoanalysis]]. In 1980 Masson was appointed Projects Director of the Freud Archives, with full access to Freud's correspondence and other unpublished papers. While perusing this material, Masson concluded that Freud might have rejected the seduction theory in order to advance the cause of [[psychoanalysis]] and to maintain his own place within the psychoanalytic inner circle, after a hostile response from the renowned sex-pathologist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] and the rest of the Vienna Psychiatric Society in 1896 - \"an icy reception from the jackasses,\" was the way Freud described it later to Fliess\n<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9A0CEFDA123BF936A1575BC0A967948260 \"Did Freud's Isolation Lead Him to Reverse Theory on Neurosis?\"] by Ralph Blumenthal, ''[[New York Times]]'', August 25, 1981</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Masson's controversial conclusions were discussed in a series of ''[[New York Times]]'' articles by Ralph Blumenthal, to the dismay of the psychoanalytic establishment. Masson was subsequently dismissed from his position as project director of the Freud Archives and stripped of his membership in psychoanalytic professional societies. Masson was defended by [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]]<ref>PSYCHOLOGIE HEUTE, April 1987, P.21, 22: \"Im Gegensatz zu manchen Interpreten, die, wie zum Beispiel Marianne Kr\u00fcll, Marie Balmary oder Jeffrey Masson, Freuds Abkehr von der Wahrheit als Folge seiner Familiengeschichte deuten, sehe ich diesen Schritt als Folge und Ausdruck unserer jahrtausendealten kinderfeindlichen Tradition, in der wir auch heute noch leben. Die Ergebnisse der oben genannten historischen Forscher k\u00f6nnen trotzdem korrekt sein, aber ich meine, da\u00df es Freud trotz der pers\u00f6nlichen Familiengeschichte m\u00f6glich gewesen w\u00e4re, seiner Entdeckung treu zu bleiben, wenn die Gesellschaft als Ganzes nicht so kinderfeindlich gewesen w\u00e4re, wenn schon damals andere, freiere Erziehungsmuster denkbar gewesen w\u00e4ren.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 20, 2012. In the episode, American singer-songwriter [[Lady Gaga]] makes a visit to Springfield, where all of its residents are in a state of depression. Main character [[Lisa Simpson]] is arguably the most depressed person in the city, prompting Gaga to go out of her way to teach Lisa the meaning of happiness.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Tim Long]] and directed by Matthew Schofield. Gaga guest-starred in the episode, portraying an animated version of herself. A fan of the show, she was brought on by showrunner [[Al Jean]], who wrote a script after [[James L. Brooks]] saw an interview of her on ''[[60 Minutes]]''. The design team conceived eighteen outfits to complement Gaga's eccentric persona, which satirized several of her outfits including her [[Lady Gaga's meat dress|meat dress]]. Recording sessions for \"Lisa Goes Gaga\" took place in [[Los Angeles, California]] over four days in August 2011. \n\nCritical responses to the episode were mixed to negative; critics praised Lady Gaga's performance, while they looked down upon the episode's concept and general execution. According to the [[Nielsen ratings]], the installment attained 4.79 million American viewers upon its original airing.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lady Gaga]] passes through [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] via train while on her way to a concert.  Seeing how low the city's self-esteem is, she takes it upon herself to cheer up the whole city. However, no one in town is more depressed than [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], who was voted as the most unpopular student by her peers. Lisa tries to reverse her status as one of the least popular girls in school by ghostwriting positive things about herself on the school blog under the heading \"Truth Teller\".\n\nWhen [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] finds out her secret and reveals it to the school, her social ranking plummets to a new low until a psychic force tells Lady Gaga that Lisa needs her help immediately. After much soul searching and yelling at Lady Gaga for trying to help, Lisa realizes that her outburst helped her because she is finally expressing her anger instead of bottling it up inside her, in effect making Lady Gaga's mission successful. Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than being like anyone else. Just as Lady Gaga's train begins to leave again, [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] runs up to her and asks if she can help him as well, but Lady Gaga declines, stating that she's not that good. As Moe turns and walks across the train track, a second train hits him.<!--He appears in the following episode alive, \"Moonshine River\"-->\n\nDuring the credits, Homer is heard singing his rendition of \"[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]\".\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Gaga pyro bra 02.jpg|thumb|Gaga's Pyrotechnic Underwear was one of her outfits that was parodied in the episode.]]\n\nIn August 2011, it first was revealed that [[Lady Gaga]] would make a guest appearance on the show as herself.<ref name=EW>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/08/23/lady-gaga-the-simpsons-exclusive-photo/?iid=rcfooter-tv-%27simpsons%27+goes+gaga%3A+first+pic!|title=Lady Gaga to guest on 'The Simpsons' -- Exclusive Photo|last=Snierson|first= Dan|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|date=August 23, 2011|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/lady-gaga-to-spice-up-the-simpsons-16041045.html|title=Lady Gaga to spice up The Simpsons|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|date=August 25, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/lady-gaga-gets-animated-for-the-simpsons/2011/08/23/gIQA3B2CZJ_blog.html|title=Lady Gaga gets animated for \u2018The Simpsons\u2019|first=Sarah|last=Anne Hughes|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 23, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/23/lady-gaga-to-guest-star-the-simpsons_n_934423.html|title=Lady Gaga To Guest-Star On 'The Simpsons'|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[Arianna Huffington]]|date=August 23, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref> Producer [[James L.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 20, 2012. In the episode, American singer-songwriter [[Lady Gaga]] makes a visit to Springfield, where all of its residents are in a state of depression. Main character [[Lisa Simpson]] is arguably the most depressed person in the city, prompting Gaga to go out of her way to teach Lisa the meaning of happiness.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Tim Long]] and directed by Matthew Schofield. Gaga guest-starred in the episode, portraying an animated version of herself. A fan of the show, she was brought on by showrunner [[Al Jean]], who wrote a script after [[James L. Brooks]] saw an interview of her on ''[[60 Minutes]]''. The design team conceived eighteen outfits to complement Gaga's eccentric persona, which satirized several of her outfits including her [[Lady Gaga's meat dress|meat dress]]. Recording sessions for \"Lisa Goes Gaga\" took place in [[Los Angeles, California]] over four days in August 2011. \n\nCritical responses to the episode were mixed to negative; critics praised Lady Gaga's performance, while they looked down upon the episode's concept and general execution. According to the [[Nielsen ratings]], the installment attained 4.79 million American viewers upon its original airing.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lady Gaga]] passes through [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] via train while on her way to a concert.  Seeing how low the city's self-esteem is, she takes it upon herself to cheer up the whole city. However, no one in town is more depressed than [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], who was voted as the most unpopular student by her peers. Lisa tries to reverse her status as one of the least popular girls in school by ghostwriting positive things about herself on the school blog under the heading \"Truth Teller\".\n\nWhen [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] finds out her secret and reveals it to the school, her social ranking plummets to a new low until a psychic force tells Lady Gaga that Lisa needs her help immediately. After much soul searching and yelling at Lady Gaga for trying to help, Lisa realizes that her outburst helped her because she is finally expressing her anger instead of bottling it up inside her, in effect making Lady Gaga's mission successful. Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than being like anyone else. Just as Lady Gaga's train begins to leave again, [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] runs up to her and asks if she can help him as well, but Lady Gaga declines, stating that she's not that good. As Moe turns and walks across the train track, a second train hits him.<!--He appears in the following episode alive, \"Moonshine River\"-->\n\nDuring the credits, Homer is heard singing his rendition of \"[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]\".\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Gaga pyro bra 02.jpg|thumb|Gaga's Pyrotechnic Underwear was one of her outfits that was parodied in the episode.]]\n\nIn August 2011, it first was revealed that [[Lady Gaga]] would make a guest appearance on the show as herself.<ref name=EW>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/08/23/lady-gaga-the-simpsons-exclusive-photo/?iid=rcfooter-tv-%27simpsons%27+goes+gaga%3A+first+pic!|title=Lady Gaga to guest on 'The Simpsons' -- Exclusive Photo|last=Snierson|first= Dan|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|date=August 23, 2011|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/lady-gaga-to-spice-up-the-simpsons-16041045.html|title=Lady Gaga to spice up The Simpsons|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|date=August 25, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/lady-gaga-gets-animated-for-the-simpsons/2011/08/23/gIQA3B2CZJ_blog.html|title=Lady Gaga gets animated for \u2018The Simpsons\u2019|first=Sarah|last=Anne Hughes|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 23, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/23/lady-gaga-to-guest-star-the-simpsons_n_934423.html|title=Lady Gaga To Guest-Star On 'The Simpsons'|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[Arianna Huffington]]|date=August 23, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref> Producer [[James L.
