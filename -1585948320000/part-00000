''All My Children'' was the first new network daytime drama to debut in the 1970s. Originally owned by Creative Horizons, Inc., the company created by Nixon and her husband, Bob, the show was sold to ABC in January 1975.<ref>Wakefield, D: \"All Her Children\", page 115. Doubleday & Company, 1976<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> The series started at a half-hour in per-installment length, then was expanded to a full hour on April 25, 1977. Earlier, the show had experimented with the full-hour format for one week starting on June 30, 1975, after which ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'' premiered.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1990, ''All My Children'' was recorded at ABC's TV18 at 101 West 67th St, now a 50-story apartment tower. From March 1990 to December 2009, it was taped at ABC's Studio TV23 at 320 West 66th Street in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In December 2009, the locale for taping the series moved from Manhattan to less costly [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], California. The show was then produced in Stages 1 and 2 at the Andrita Studios in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], California, from 2010 to 2011, and then at the Connecticut Film Center in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], Connecticut.<ref name=\"Soapcentral.com Relocate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2009/0803-moving_02.php|title=Rumor no more: All My Children relocating to Los Angeles|publisher=[[SoapCentral]]|date=August 4, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://sn.soapnet.go.com/news/article/huge-all-my-children-and-one-life-to-live-news Huge \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807095524/http://sn.soapnet.go.com/news/article/huge-all-my-children-and-one-life-to-live-news |date=August 7, 2009 }}, ''SOAPnet'', August 4, 2009</ref> ''All My Children'' started taping in high definition on January 4, 2010, and began airing in high definition on February 3, 2010.

Also, in a departure from societal norms at the time, ''All My Children'', in the mid-1970s, had an audience that was estimated to be 30% male.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913850-5,00.html Sex and Suffering in the Afternoon], TIME</ref> The show ranked No. 1 in the [[List of US daytime soap opera ratings|daytime Nielsen ratings]] in the 1978\u201379 season. Throughout most of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, ''All My Children'' was the No. 2 daytime soap opera on the air. However, like the rest of the soap operas in the United States, ''All My Children'' experienced unprecedented declines in its daytime ratings during the 2000s. By the 2010s, it had become one of the least watched soap operas in daytime television.\n\nOn April 14, 2011, ABC announced the cancellation of ''All My Children'' after a run of 41 years due to low ratings.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\">[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/abc-cancels-all-my-children-178666 ABC Cancels \"All My Children\", \"One Life to Live\"], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', April 14, 2011</ref> On July 7, 2011, ABC sold the licensing rights of ''All My Children'' to third-party production company [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]] with the show set to continue on the internet as a series of [[webisode]]s.<ref name=\"ABC and Prospect Park \">{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/one-life-to-live/OLTL-licensing-announcement |title=One Life to Live announcement |publisher=ABC Network |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021045607/http://abc.go.com/shows/one-life-to-live/OLTL-licensing-announcement |archivedate=October 21, 2012 }}</ref> The show taped its final scenes for ABC on August 30, 2011, and its final episode on the network aired on September 23, 2011, with a [[cliffhanger]].

When writing the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]], she designed the show so it would be a light-hearted soap opera that focused on social issues and young love.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\">{{cite book|first1=Ron|last1=Simon|first2=Robert J.|last2=Thompson|first3=Louise|last3=Spence|first4=Jane|last4=Feuer|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Morton|title=Worlds Without End: The Art and History of the Soap Opera|publisher=Harry N.

In one specific case, she used the model of the [[Erica Kane]] character to create a brand new ''Another World'' character named [[Rachel Cory Hutchins|Rachel Davis]]. Nixon said Rachel was Erica's \"precursor to the public ... [What] Erica and Rachel have in common is they thought if they could get their dream, they'd be satisfied... But that dream has been elusive\", Nixon said.<ref>Simon, p. 28.</ref><ref>Hyatt, p. 29.</ref>\n\n=== Creation ===\nABC later approached her to create a show that would reflect a more contemporary tone. That program became ''[[One Life to Live]]'', and it debuted in 1968. After the show became a success, the network asked her for another program, and she obliged by reviving her ''All My Children'' bible and the Erica Kane character.\n\nThe poem, written by Nixon, that appears in the title credits' photo album reads: {{quote|The Great and the Least,\nThe Rich and the Poor,\nThe Weak and the Strong,\nIn Sickness and in Health,\nIn Joy and Sorrow,\nIn Tragedy and Triumph,\nYou are ALL MY CHILDREN}}\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:Ruth Warwick Phoebe Tyler 1973.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ruth Warrick as Phoebe Tyler]]\n''All My Children'' debuted on January 5, 1970, replacing the canceled game show ''[[Dream House (game show)|Dream House]]''. [[Rosemary Prinz]] was signed on to be the \"special guest star\" for six months, playing the role of political activist Amy Tyler. Prinz was well known for her role of Penny Hughes on ''As the World Turns'' in the 1950s and 1960s, and she was added to the show to give it an initial boost due to her name value. From 1970 and into the 1980s, the show was either written by Nixon herself or by her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Wisner Washam]]. He was groomed by Nixon to eventually take over the reins in the 1980s while she focused on other endeavors, which included creating and launching ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' in 1983. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nNixon strove to create a soap opera that was topical and could illustrate social issues for the audience.<ref name=\"NIXON\">{{cite web|title=NIXON, AGNES.

To keep the action more real, she allowed the audience to locate her fictional \"Pine Valley\" on a map: situated a mere hour-long train ride from New York City. Many believed Pine Valley was in New York because of a town called [[Catlin, New York|Pine Valley]] in [[western New York]]. However, it was not until the 1980s that it was finally revealed that Pine Valley is actually in Pennsylvania, near [[Philadelphia]] and also near ''[[One Life to Live]]'s'' [[Llanview]]. (Nixon reportedly modeled the town on Rosemont, an actual suburb of Philadelphia.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/2007/06/08/legends-the-original-desperate-housewife/|title=Legends: The Original Desperate Housewife|last=Callahan|first=Michael|date=8 Jun 2007|website=Philadelphia Magazine|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe show's first action takes place around several families and characters. [[Phoebe Tyler Wallingford|Phoebe Tyler]] ([[Ruth Warrick]]), who fashions herself as \"Queen of Pine Valley,\" was the paradigm of a rich snob when she is introduced. A divorced mother, [[Mona Kane]] ([[Frances Heflin]]), and her spoiled daughter, [[Erica Kane|Erica]] ([[Susan Lucci]]) were also introduced. Contrasting this was the stable [[Joe Martin (All My Children character)|Martin family]], headed by patriarch Joe and later (after the death of her husband, Ted Brent) by matriarch Ruth, who became a symbolic foundation of ''All My Children''. Destined to break up the young romance of classmates [[Tara Martin]] ([[Karen Lynn Gorney]]) and Phil Brent ([[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]]), Erica learned that Phil was not the son of Ruth and Ted but, instead, the son of Ruth's sister, Amy Tyler ([[Rosemary Prinz]]) and her mother's friend, Nick Davis. In a selfish attempt to break up Phil and Tara, she told everyone the truth.\n\n''All My Children's'' first success was its focus on young love. ABC wanted a soap opera that would bring in young viewers, and slowly the program was accomplishing that.<ref name=\"NIXON\" /> The show's ratings did not start out strong, however. In its first year on the air, it ranked No. 17 out of 19 soap operas. Despite this, its audience grew with each passing year.\n\nThe show was unique for its use of the [[Vietnam War]]. Before ''All My Children'' debuted, no show had discussed the war in any depth. There were traditional Phoebe and free-spirited Amy both butting heads over the war, with Amy often leading protests around Pine Valley. When Amy left, Ruth takes over as the anti-war voice and protests against the war in the early 1970s. The character's protest speech in 1972 won [[Mary Fickett]] the first [[Emmy Award]] given to a soap opera performer. Later in the show's run, Phoebe softened.\n\nIn May 1972, the character of Erica Kane Martin became the first television character to undergo a legal abortion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Life Can Be Beautiful/Relevant|last=Astrachan|first=Anthony|date=March 23, 1975|work=New York Times Times}}</ref>\nMaking the abortion particularly controversial is Erica's reason for doing it, not because of her jeopardized health, but rather because she did not want to gain weight and lose her modeling job. The abortion story received much media attention, especially since it preceded the Roe vs. Wade decision by nearly a year. Within the story, Erica developed a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion, and the switchboards at ABC lit up with calls from doctors and nurses, offering their medical opinions on how best to treat the character's case.\n\nPhoebe's husband Charles ([[Hugh Franklin (actor)|Hugh Franklin]]) became close to Mona (Erica's mother and his secretary at the hospital). The two fell in love and Charles divorced Phoebe, even though she tried to blackmail Mona and even faked [[paralysis]]. In the end, Phoebe was left a drunken divorc\u00e9e and Mona becomes the new Mrs. Tyler. This ordeal starts the long-time Phoebe/Mona rivalry.\n\nWhen Eileen Letchworth, who portrayed Margo Flax Martin, contemplated a facelift, she talked it over with Nixon. Not only was Letchworth going to need time off, she was going to look significantly different when she returned to the show. Nixon approved and worked the facelift into a storyline. Margo wanted to impress the somewhat younger Paul Martin ([[William Mooney]]). Margo's facelift in 1974 became one of the first major storylines on television discussing [[plastic surgery]] and its psychological effects.\n\nIn June 1976, character [[Brooke English]] showed up on her Aunt Phoebe's doorstep and soon clashed with Erica over [[Tom Cudahy]] and Mark Dalton.  In 1976, when Kitty Shea Tyler was searching for her natural mother, the show introduced [[Myrtle Fargate|Myrtle Lum Fargate]] ([[Eileen Herlie]]).\n\nBy the late 1970s, the show had risen to the top of the ratings. One reason for the rise was the arrival of teenage prostitute Donna Beck (Candice Earley). Her relationship with the handsome Dr. Chuck Tyler breathed life into the show and captivated fans. Other new additions are the arrivals of aristocratic [[Palmer Cortlandt]] (aka Peter Cooney) ([[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]]), his somewhat creepy housekeeper Myra Murdock ([[Elizabeth Lawrence (actress)|Elizabeth Lawrence]]), and his overprotected daughter Nina ([[Taylor Miller]]), who, to Palmer's chagrin, entrances [[Cliff Warner|Dr. Cliff Warner]] ([[Peter Bergman]]). Palmer does everything in his power to break up the couple, including telling Nina she is going blind due to her diabetes. Palmer teams up with Cliff's past flame, nurse Sybil Thorne ([[Linda Gibboney]]), who confronts Cliff about fathering her son, but this is temporary; Sybil is murdered and Cliff is arrested for the crime, which actually was committed by Sean Cudahy (Alan Dysert). During the murder trial, Nina is astonished to learn that her mother, Daisy Cortlandt ([[Gillian Spencer]]), whom she believes to be dead, is, in fact, alive and living in Pine Valley as Monique Jonvil. To everyone's complete shock, Myra acknowledges that Daisy is her daughter. ''All My Children'' also found memorable villains in Billy Clyde Tuggle ([[Matthew Cowles]]) and Ray Gardner ([[Gil Rogers]]).\n\n''All My Children'' had always aired in color since its 1970 debut. The episodes were initially only saved for a short time on cartridge tapes and were eventually erased in order to tape other productions. Beginning in 1976, all the episodes were saved on cartridge tape and then digitally since the late 1990s. A few early episodes were saved on [[kinescope]] in black and white, one of which aired on ABC in 1997 on a special \"A Daytime To Remember\", which showcased all TV shows that aired on ABC Daytime. But there are no known pre-1976 episodes to be still in existence on tape.\n\nNixon personally owned all the early episodes on monochromatic kinescopes. When ABC purchased the rights to ''All My Children'' in 1975, it also received the kinescopes from Nixon with a promise that the network would archive them. However, that promise was nearly broken, because different sources point out that most of them were either lost in a warehouse fire or were erased. As mentioned above, a few early episodes survive.\n\n=== 1980s ===\nThe early 1980s is considered a \"golden period\" for the show and the \"Golden Age\" for [[supercouple]]s.<ref name=\"NIXON\" /><ref name=\".amazon.com\">{{cite web|first=Bill and Susan|last=Hayes|title=Like Sands Through The Hourglass|publisher=NAL Hardcover|accessdate=2007-09-06|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0451216601}}</ref><ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com\">{{cite web|first=Janet|last=Di Lauro|title=Supercouples: A Relic From the '80s or Still Alive and Kissing?|publisher=soapoperadigest.com|accessdate=2007-09-06|url=http://soapoperadigest.com/features/supercouples/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906220936/http://soapoperadigest.com/features/supercouples|archivedate=September 6, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Younger characters, such as [[Greg Nelson and Jenny Gardner]] ([[Laurence Lau]] and [[Kim Delaney]]), [[Liza Colby]] ([[Marcy Walker]]), Liza's best friend Amanda ([[Amanda Bearse]]), [[Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter]] ([[Darnell Williams]] and [[Debbi Morgan]]), and a now-grown-up [[Tad Martin (All My Children)|Tad Martin]] ([[Michael E.

Lynn however rebuffs her. Before this storyline, no other American soap opera had done a story about homosexuality.<ref name=goliath.ecnext.com />\n\nThe show tackled the issue of drug use when [[Mark La Mura]]'s character, [[Mark Dalton (All My Children)|Mark Dalton]], becomes addicted to cocaine after years of casual use. His half-sister, Erica, stages an intervention with his friends to have him confront his problems. They practice a [[tough love]]-policy that has Mark admit to the addiction. The informative episode showed how to hold an intervention, and the stages to go through for a successful confrontation. On March 18, 1985, the episode of ''All My Children'' included the scene while [[Erica Kane]] ([[Susan Lucci]]) met and became friends with [[Stephen J. Cannell]], the writer, creator, and producer of drama shows ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[Riptide (American TV series)|Riptide]]'', ''[[Hunter (1984 U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]'', and ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''.\n\nControversy was prompted in 1987 with the arrival of Cindy Parker ([[Ellen Wheeler]]), who would later fall in love with Stuart. The character was revealed to have [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. Through visits by now-Dr. Angie Hubbard, the show educated the public on how the disease was spread and how to prevent it. Cindy had contracted HIV from her husband, Fred, played by Mark Morrison who contracted it from sharing needles for drug use. Cindy is attacked by a vigilante hate group led by her niece, [[Skye Chandler]]. The tragedy of the attack shows the extremes of violence that occur every day to victims of the disease. Cindy marries Stuart and he adopts her son, Scott. She dies early in 1989 in one of the show's most watched episodes. ABC wanted changes at ''All My Children''. The show was getting about 6.5 million viewers per episode, but there was sentiment that the program had lost its unique sense of humor and was simply copying other soaps with [[action/adventure]] storylines. Efforts were made to bring the show back to the glory days of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n[[Felicia Minei Behr]] was hired as the new executive producer in early 1989. Having been a producer on [[Ryan's Hope]], Behr was familiar with ''All My Children'', having been an associate producer from 1970 to 1975. Among the stories featured was a baby storyline involving the characters of Adam, Brooke, Tad, and Dixie ([[Cady McClain]]). By this time, the show had also found a \"hit couple\" in Cecily and Nico (portrayed by [[Rosa Nevin]] and [[Maurice Benard]]), but Behr was unable to convince either to remain with the show, and the duo left at the end of 1989.\n\nABC was pleased with Behr; Nixon was as well, and decided her creation was safe in the hands of the new producer. Behr, however, made the unpopular decision to fire Peter Bergman (Cliff Warner) during this time, as well as Ellen Wheeler (Karen) and Robert Gentry (Ross Chandler). Bergman's departure was particularly frustrating to Debbi Morgan (who thought it was a cop-out by ABC on the promising interracial Angie/Cliff pairing; Morgan later defected to the new NBC soap opera ''[[Generations (U.S. TV series)|Generations]]'' in protest), Taylor Miller (who was misled when Behr approached her to bring back her character Nina; Miller was frustrated to find out she had only been brought back for two weeks to facilitate Bergman's departure: Cliff and Nina reunited, married yet again, and left Pine Valley, leaving Miller to lament to ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' that she felt it was going backward for both characters, and difficult emotionally to play), and Bergman himself. Behr then brought back fan favorite Opal Gardner, but instead of contacting Emmy winner Dorothy Lyman to reprise the role, Behr hired [[Jill Larson]]. Lyman later noted her disappointment in never being contacted about reprising the role.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nAt the time of Behr's hiring in early 1989, the show usually ranked around No. 4 in the ratings. By 1990, it had inched up to the No. 3 spot. Billy Clyde Tuggle returns to Pine Valley in 1990, after a ten-year absence (in prison). He proceeds to undo the lives of many in Pine Valley. He tells his daughter, Emily Ann Sago, that he is her natural father, devastating her with the truth that she was the product of rape. He dies tumbling over a bridge (with Tad Martin), ending the reign of one of Pine Valley's most evil and entertaining characters ever.\n\nABC chose [[Megan McTavish]], a former actress who had been on the writing team since 1987, to be its new head writer. She was officially promoted to that position in 1992, with Nixon serving as executive head writer. Stories such as Molly's leukemia, Ceara Connor's ([[Genie Francis]]) [[incest]], Mona's lung cancer, and Deconstruction (a story about racism), were all praised in soap opera magazines for their social conscience. Other storylines included the ''Who Killed Will Cortlandt?'' mystery, Willow Lake Acres (a both humorous and serious tale about the plight of the elderly in a fraudulent nursing home), and a tornado that rocked Pine Valley. Behr also helped craft a story re-exploring Erica's father, Eric Kane. It was revealed he had faked his own death. In a comical twist, Erica finds him working as a clown in a traveling circus.\n\nMcTavish was also instrumental in a major but still popular [[retroactive continuity]] (retcon) storyline in 1993. Shortly after being introduced, the audience soon learns [[Kendall Hart]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) is actually Erica's long-lost daughter. Kendall was conceived after Erica was raped on her 14th birthday by her father's actor friend Richard Fields. After she became pregnant, Erica gave her baby up for adoption to the Harts, a couple from Florida. Kendall comes to Pine Valley after finding out her birth mother is the famous Erica Kane. Kendall longs for Erica's approval<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steinback|first1=Sheila|title=Star of the Year 1994: AMC's Sarah Michelle Gellar|journal=Soap Opera Magazine|date=January 24, 1994}}</ref> but is also angry over her perceived feelings of being 'abandoned' at birth and comes to want payback against her mother.<ref name=\"Tracy\">{{cite book|author =Kathleen Tracy|title=The Girl's Got Bite: The Original Unauthorized Guide to Buffy's World ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlE1_oTihcUC&pg=PA63&dq=Kendall+Hart+soap+opera|isbn=0-312-31258-X|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2003|page=384}}</ref> Although they try to make their family work at first, Kendall acts out <ref>{{cite journal|title=Editor's Choice|journal=Soap Opera Digest|date=February 15, 1994}}</ref> and mother and daughter experience a painful, strained, and complicated relationship during this time in the series. The popular Gellar was proclaimed by some \"as the second coming of Erica\"<ref name=\"Tracy\" /> in her two years as Kendall Hart from 1993\u20131995 but left the show to pursue other acting opportunities. Producers ended up waiting at least six years before even contemplating to recast the role (which eventually went to [[Alicia Minshew]] in 2002).\n\nThe Santos, Dillon, Frye, and Keefer families were introduced during the 90s as well. Also, the [[Tad Martin and Dixie Cooney|Tad and Dixie]] pairing had become especially popular.<ref name=\"West1\">{{cite magazine|first=Abby |last=West |title=17 Great Soap Supercouples: Tad and Dixie |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-01-29 |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_15,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201164527/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0%2C%2C20174499_15%2C00.html |archivedate=February 1, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The show also had other couples with great followings during this time: [[Dimitri Marick and Erica Kane|Dimitri and Erica]] ([[Michael Nader]]),<ref name=\"West2\">{{cite magazine|first=Abby |last=West |title=17 Great Soap Supercouples: Erica and Dimitri |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-01-29 |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_10,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201164501/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0%2C%2C20174499_10%2C00.html |archivedate=February 1, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Trevor ([[James Kiberd]]) and Natalie ([[Kate Collins (actress)|Kate Collins]]), and Hayley ([[Kelly Ripa]]) and Brian (Gregory Gordon, [[Matt Borlenghi]], Brian L. Greene).\n\nBy the early/mid-1990s, some of McTavish's storytelling received criticism for being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines and the direction of the series. After the [[O.J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson trial]] preempted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and ''All My Children'' was no different. When Megan McTavish was fired from her head writing post in the spring, former head writer [[Lorraine Broderick]] was tapped by Behr to lead the team once again.\n\nBroderick's tenure under Behr was popular among critics and fans for returning ''All My Children'' to its socially relevant, character-driven roots. Her most significant successes were Erica's drug addiction story (with the character receiving treatment at the [[Betty Ford Center]]), and also the story of [[homophobia]] over a gay high school boy and a history teacher.<ref name=goliath.ecnext.com /> However, with the ratings still stagnant, ABC did not renew longtime executive producer Felicia Minei Behr's contract, and brought in [[Francesca James]] (who had previously won an Emmy award acting on the show as twins Kitty and Kelly). The storylines now included a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] arc with the popular [[Julia Santos|Noah and Julia]] ([[Keith Hamilton Cobb]] and [[Sydney Penny]]), a fantasy story for Myrtle featuring the \"real\" [[Santa Claus]], and finally a baby kidnapping story involving Erica.\n\nDespite winning three consecutive Daytime Emmys for writing during her tenure on ''All My Children'', Broderick was replaced in December 1997 by her predecessor, McTavish. The first major story McTavish tackled was, \"ironically\", one created by Broderick, [[Bianca Montgomery]]'s [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]. The character of Bianca, Erica's young daughter, is checked into a facility to treat the disease. Apart from the anorexia story, McTavish's tales were plot-driven<ref name=\"sympatico.msn.ca\">{{cite magazine|first=Nelson |last=Branco |title=The plot to save 'All My Children': New head writers Barbara Esensten and James Harmon Brown dish on recasting Babe, Dixie's death, and creating a diverse canvas |magazine=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2007-11-06 |url=http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/The+plot+to+save+All+My+Children/TV_Guide/Soaps/Features/Articles/070823_all_my_children_NB.htm?isfa=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013233937/http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/The%2Bplot%2Bto%2Bsave%2BAll%2BMy%2BChildren/TV_Guide/Soaps/Features/Articles/070823_all_my_children_NB.htm?isfa=1 |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and made implausible alterations to the show's history such as the resurrection of Erica's lifetime-love, Mike Roy (Nicholas Surovy). In 1998, the show again got a new executive producer, [[Jean Dadario Burke]], taking over from [[Francesca James]]. She would become known to many speculating fans as a weak producer with little vision.\n\n[[Cady McClain]], who had left the show as Dixie in 1996, returned to the delight of her fans, but other storylines\u2014involving ghosts, poison tattoos, Nazi art, and a sperm switch\u2014were all ill-received. By the start of 1999, with ''All My Children'' being voted as the \"Worst of 1998\" by ''Soap Opera Digest'', McTavish was once again fired. As ratings began to fall, ABC convinced Nixon to make a brief return. Many long-running actors, such as [[Michael Nader]], [[James Kiberd]], and [[Robin Mattson]], left their roles.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nNixon decided to write a story that would rejuvenate the show and be socially relevant at the same time. This resulted in the series revealing Erica's daughter Bianca as a lesbian. Within the series, Bianca admits the truth to her mother in December 2000. Although initially controversial, the storyline was praised by fans and critics.<ref name=\"soapcentral.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2001/0302-gayawards.php|title=AMC's Bianca Storyline Applauded|publisher=[[SoapCentral]]|year=2001|accessdate=2007-10-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105041711/http://www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2001/0302-gayawards.php|archivedate=November 5, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"AfterElton.com\">{{cite news|first=Karman |last=Kregloe |title=Soaps Come Clean About Gay Teens (page 3) |publisher=[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton.com]] |date=March 23, 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-09 |url=http://www.afterelton.com/archive/elton/TV/2006/3/soaps3.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611155124/http://www.afterelton.com/archive/elton/TV/2006/3/soaps3.html |archivedate=June 11, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|first=Patrick D.|last=Healy|title=\nAfter Coming Out, a Soap Opera Heroine Moves On|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 24, 2005|accessdate=2007-10-14|url=\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/24/arts/television/24EDEN.html}}</ref> Bianca emerged as a [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]] and lesbian icon.<ref name=AfterElton.com /><ref name=nytimes.com /><ref name=\"WWW.afterellen.com\">{{cite web|first=Lisa |last=Yimm |title=Olga Sosnovska, AMC's Unlikely Lesbian Icon |publisher=[[AfterEllen.com]] |date=April 2004 |accessdate=2008-04-07 |url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/TV/amc-olga.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116110907/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/TV/amc-olga.html |archivedate=January 16, 2008 }}</ref> The show found additional success in the pairing of newcomers [[Leo du Pres and Greenlee Smythe|Leo and Greenlee]] ([[Josh Duhamel]] and [[Rebecca Budig]]).<ref name=\"SoapOperaDigest.com\">{{cite magazine|title=Best New Couple|magazine=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|year=2000}}</ref><ref name=\"eyeonsoaps.net\">{{cite web|first=Carolyn |last=Aspenson |title=Redefining the Super Couple |publisher=eyeonsoaps.net |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-05 |url=http://eyeonsoaps.net/wp/?p=1765 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627112608/http://eyeonsoaps.net/wp/?p=1765 |archivedate=June 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Culliton]] wrote several of ''All My Children's'' early 2000s (decade) storylines.

The town exists in the same fictional universe as other serial settings such as [[Llanview]] (''[[One Life to Live]]''), [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]] (''[[General Hospital]]'', ''[[Port Charles]]'', ''[[The Young Marrieds]]''), [[New York City]] (''[[Ryan's Hope]]'') and [[Corinth, Pennsylvania|Corinth]] (''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'').\n\n=== Crossovers ===\nIn 2000, ''All My Children'', was featured in a major crossover event, that encompassed all the then existing ABC Daytime soap lineup. [[Linda Dano]] brought her ''[[One Life to Live]]'' character [[Rae Cummings]], to Pine Valley, where she connected with her mother [[Myrtle Fargate]]. It was also revealed during that storyline, that longtime existing ''All My Children'' character [[Skye Chandler]], was Rae's daughter. Skye, who had spent time on ''[[One Life to Live]]'' from  1999\u20132001, then followed Rae to Port Charles, the setting of the soaps ''[[General Hospital]]'' and ''[[Port Charles]]'', where she became a member of the [[Quartermaine family]], and made appearances until 2012.\n\n''All My Children'' has featured several crossovers with other ABC soaps, including an extensive 2004 'baby switch' storyline with ''One Life to Live'' which featured crossovers of over 20 characters between the two shows. In 2011, AMC did a comedic crossover with the [[TV Land]] comedy ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', in which fictitious actress Victoria Chase (portrayed by [[Wendie Malick]] but credited as Chase) does a cameo appearance on AMC alongside Susan Lucci. In the ''Hot in Cleveland'' storyline, Chase and Lucci (portrayed as herself) are daytime-TV contemporaries and rivals.\n\nIn 2017, ''All My Children'' character [[Alexandra Devane]] appeared on ''[[General Hospital]]'', where she masqueraded as her sister [[Anna Devane]].\n\n== Ratings ==\n''For historical ratings information, see [[List of U.S. daytime soap opera ratings]]''\n\n;Years as No. 1 series\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!

When writing the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]], she designed the show so it would be a light-hearted soap opera that focused on social issues and young love.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\">{{cite book|first1=Ron|last1=Simon|first2=Robert J.|last2=Thompson|first3=Louise|last3=Spence|first4=Jane|last4=Feuer|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Morton|title=Worlds Without End: The Art and History of the Soap Opera|publisher=Harry N.

In one specific case, she used the model of the [[Erica Kane]] character to create a brand new ''Another World'' character named [[Rachel Cory Hutchins|Rachel Davis]]. Nixon said Rachel was Erica's \"precursor to the public ... [What] Erica and Rachel have in common is they thought if they could get their dream, they'd be satisfied... But that dream has been elusive\", Nixon said.<ref>Simon, p. 28.</ref><ref>Hyatt, p. 29.</ref>\n\n=== Creation ===\nABC later approached her to create a show that would reflect a more contemporary tone. That program became ''[[One Life to Live]]'', and it debuted in 1968. After the show became a success, the network asked her for another program, and she obliged by reviving her ''All My Children'' bible and the Erica Kane character.\n\nThe poem, written by Nixon, that appears in the title credits' photo album reads: {{quote|The Great and the Least,\nThe Rich and the Poor,\nThe Weak and the Strong,\nIn Sickness and in Health,\nIn Joy and Sorrow,\nIn Tragedy and Triumph,\nYou are ALL MY CHILDREN}}\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:Ruth Warwick Phoebe Tyler 1973.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ruth Warrick as Phoebe Tyler]]\n''All My Children'' debuted on January 5, 1970, replacing the canceled game show ''[[Dream House (game show)|Dream House]]''. [[Rosemary Prinz]] was signed on to be the \"special guest star\" for six months, playing the role of political activist Amy Tyler. Prinz was well known for her role of Penny Hughes on ''As the World Turns'' in the 1950s and 1960s, and she was added to the show to give it an initial boost due to her name value. From 1970 and into the 1980s, the show was either written by Nixon herself or by her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Wisner Washam]]. He was groomed by Nixon to eventually take over the reins in the 1980s while she focused on other endeavors, which included creating and launching ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' in 1983. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nNixon strove to create a soap opera that was topical and could illustrate social issues for the audience.<ref name=\"NIXON\">{{cite web|title=NIXON, AGNES. U.S. Writer-Producer|work=museum.tv|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nixonagnes/nixonagnes.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713081129/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nixonagnes/nixonagnes.htm|archivedate=July 13, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She wanted this and a combination of regular humor for the series. To keep the action more real, she allowed the audience to locate her fictional \"Pine Valley\" on a map: situated a mere hour-long train ride from New York City. Many believed Pine Valley was in New York because of a town called [[Catlin, New York|Pine Valley]] in [[western New York]]. However, it was not until the 1980s that it was finally revealed that Pine Valley is actually in Pennsylvania, near [[Philadelphia]] and also near ''[[One Life to Live]]'s'' [[Llanview]]. (Nixon reportedly modeled the town on Rosemont, an actual suburb of Philadelphia.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/2007/06/08/legends-the-original-desperate-housewife/|title=Legends: The Original Desperate Housewife|last=Callahan|first=Michael|date=8 Jun 2007|website=Philadelphia Magazine|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe show's first action takes place around several families and characters. [[Phoebe Tyler Wallingford|Phoebe Tyler]] ([[Ruth Warrick]]), who fashions herself as \"Queen of Pine Valley,\" was the paradigm of a rich snob when she is introduced. A divorced mother, [[Mona Kane]] ([[Frances Heflin]]), and her spoiled daughter, [[Erica Kane|Erica]] ([[Susan Lucci]]) were also introduced. Contrasting this was the stable [[Joe Martin (All My Children character)|Martin family]], headed by patriarch Joe and later (after the death of her husband, Ted Brent) by matriarch Ruth, who became a symbolic foundation of ''All My Children''. Destined to break up the young romance of classmates [[Tara Martin]] ([[Karen Lynn Gorney]]) and Phil Brent ([[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]]), Erica learned that Phil was not the son of Ruth and Ted but, instead, the son of Ruth's sister, Amy Tyler ([[Rosemary Prinz]]) and her mother's friend, Nick Davis. In a selfish attempt to break up Phil and Tara, she told everyone the truth.\n\n''All My Children's'' first success was its focus on young love. ABC wanted a soap opera that would bring in young viewers, and slowly the program was accomplishing that.<ref name=\"NIXON\" /> The show's ratings did not start out strong, however. In its first year on the air, it ranked No. 17 out of 19 soap operas. Despite this, its audience grew with each passing year.\n\nThe show was unique for its use of the [[Vietnam War]]. Before ''All My Children'' debuted, no show had discussed the war in any depth. There were traditional Phoebe and free-spirited Amy both butting heads over the war, with Amy often leading protests around Pine Valley. When Amy left, Ruth takes over as the anti-war voice and protests against the war in the early 1970s. The character's protest speech in 1972 won [[Mary Fickett]] the first [[Emmy Award]] given to a soap opera performer. Later in the show's run, Phoebe softened.\n\nIn May 1972, the character of Erica Kane Martin became the first television character to undergo a legal abortion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Life Can Be Beautiful/Relevant|last=Astrachan|first=Anthony|date=March 23, 1975|work=New York Times Times}}</ref>\nMaking the abortion particularly controversial is Erica's reason for doing it, not because of her jeopardized health, but rather because she did not want to gain weight and lose her modeling job. The abortion story received much media attention, especially since it preceded the Roe vs. Wade decision by nearly a year. Within the story, Erica developed a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion, and the switchboards at ABC lit up with calls from doctors and nurses, offering their medical opinions on how best to treat the character's case.\n\nPhoebe's husband Charles ([[Hugh Franklin (actor)|Hugh Franklin]]) became close to Mona (Erica's mother and his secretary at the hospital). The two fell in love and Charles divorced Phoebe, even though she tried to blackmail Mona and even faked [[paralysis]]. In the end, Phoebe was left a drunken divorc\u00e9e and Mona becomes the new Mrs. Tyler. This ordeal starts the long-time Phoebe/Mona rivalry.\n\nWhen Eileen Letchworth, who portrayed Margo Flax Martin, contemplated a facelift, she talked it over with Nixon. Not only was Letchworth going to need time off, she was going to look significantly different when she returned to the show. Nixon approved and worked the facelift into a storyline. Margo wanted to impress the somewhat younger Paul Martin ([[William Mooney]]). Margo's facelift in 1974 became one of the first major storylines on television discussing [[plastic surgery]] and its psychological effects.\n\nIn June 1976, character [[Brooke English]] showed up on her Aunt Phoebe's doorstep and soon clashed with Erica over [[Tom Cudahy]] and Mark Dalton.  In 1976, when Kitty Shea Tyler was searching for her natural mother, the show introduced [[Myrtle Fargate|Myrtle Lum Fargate]] ([[Eileen Herlie]]).\n\nBy the late 1970s, the show had risen to the top of the ratings. One reason for the rise was the arrival of teenage prostitute Donna Beck (Candice Earley). Her relationship with the handsome Dr. Chuck Tyler breathed life into the show and captivated fans. Other new additions are the arrivals of aristocratic [[Palmer Cortlandt]] (aka Peter Cooney) ([[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]]), his somewhat creepy housekeeper Myra Murdock ([[Elizabeth Lawrence (actress)|Elizabeth Lawrence]]), and his overprotected daughter Nina ([[Taylor Miller]]), who, to Palmer's chagrin, entrances [[Cliff Warner|Dr. Cliff Warner]] ([[Peter Bergman]]). Palmer does everything in his power to break up the couple, including telling Nina she is going blind due to her diabetes. Palmer teams up with Cliff's past flame, nurse Sybil Thorne ([[Linda Gibboney]]), who confronts Cliff about fathering her son, but this is temporary; Sybil is murdered and Cliff is arrested for the crime, which actually was committed by Sean Cudahy (Alan Dysert). During the murder trial, Nina is astonished to learn that her mother, Daisy Cortlandt ([[Gillian Spencer]]), whom she believes to be dead, is, in fact, alive and living in Pine Valley as Monique Jonvil. To everyone's complete shock, Myra acknowledges that Daisy is her daughter. ''All My Children'' also found memorable villains in Billy Clyde Tuggle ([[Matthew Cowles]]) and Ray Gardner ([[Gil Rogers]]).\n\n''All My Children'' had always aired in color since its 1970 debut. The episodes were initially only saved for a short time on cartridge tapes and were eventually erased in order to tape other productions. Beginning in 1976, all the episodes were saved on cartridge tape and then digitally since the late 1990s. A few early episodes were saved on [[kinescope]] in black and white, one of which aired on ABC in 1997 on a special \"A Daytime To Remember\", which showcased all TV shows that aired on ABC Daytime. But there are no known pre-1976 episodes to be still in existence on tape.\n\nNixon personally owned all the early episodes on monochromatic kinescopes. When ABC purchased the rights to ''All My Children'' in 1975, it also received the kinescopes from Nixon with a promise that the network would archive them. However, that promise was nearly broken, because different sources point out that most of them were either lost in a warehouse fire or were erased. As mentioned above, a few early episodes survive.\n\n=== 1980s ===\nThe early 1980s is considered a \"golden period\" for the show and the \"Golden Age\" for [[supercouple]]s.<ref name=\"NIXON\" /><ref name=\".amazon.com\">{{cite web|first=Bill and Susan|last=Hayes|title=Like Sands Through The Hourglass|publisher=NAL Hardcover|accessdate=2007-09-06|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0451216601}}</ref><ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com\">{{cite web|first=Janet|last=Di Lauro|title=Supercouples: A Relic From the '80s or Still Alive and Kissing?|publisher=soapoperadigest.com|accessdate=2007-09-06|url=http://soapoperadigest.com/features/supercouples/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906220936/http://soapoperadigest.com/features/supercouples|archivedate=September 6, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Younger characters, such as [[Greg Nelson and Jenny Gardner]] ([[Laurence Lau]] and [[Kim Delaney]]), [[Liza Colby]] ([[Marcy Walker]]), Liza's best friend Amanda ([[Amanda Bearse]]), [[Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter]] ([[Darnell Williams]] and [[Debbi Morgan]]), and a now-grown-up [[Tad Martin (All My Children)|Tad Martin]] ([[Michael E.

Opal greatly showcased ''All My Children'''s attempt at humor and satire. Also introduced in the 1980s were powerful businessman [[Adam Chandler]] and his identical twin brother [[Stuart Chandler|Stuart]] (both played by [[David Canary]]), the first arrival of members of the [[Chandler family]].

This is evident with her writing an autobiography, \"Raising Kane\", and turning it into a motion picture. When her presumed half-sister Silver (Deborah Goodrich) accuses her of murdering Kent Bogard (Michael Woods, Lee Godart), her former lover and boss, she goes on the run, fleeing to the [[Hollywood Hills]]. She does all this while posing as a [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|sister]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe show made its first attempt at tackling the taboo topic of homosexuality in 1983. [[Tricia Pursley]] portrayed the divorced Devon McFadden, who believes she is falling in love with her [[lesbian]] psychiatrist, Lynn Carson (portrayed by [[Donna Pescow]]).<ref name=\"goliath.ecnext.com\">{{cite book|author =C.

Lynn however rebuffs her. Before this storyline, no other American soap opera had done a story about homosexuality.<ref name=goliath.ecnext.com />\n\nThe show tackled the issue of drug use when [[Mark La Mura]]'s character, [[Mark Dalton (All My Children)|Mark Dalton]], becomes addicted to cocaine after years of casual use. His half-sister, Erica, stages an intervention with his friends to have him confront his problems. They practice a [[tough love]]-policy that has Mark admit to the addiction. The informative episode showed how to hold an intervention, and the stages to go through for a successful confrontation. On March 18, 1985, the episode of ''All My Children'' included the scene while [[Erica Kane]] ([[Susan Lucci]]) met and became friends with [[Stephen J. Cannell]], the writer, creator, and producer of drama shows ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[Riptide (American TV series)|Riptide]]'', ''[[Hunter (1984 U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]'', and ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''.\n\nControversy was prompted in 1987 with the arrival of Cindy Parker ([[Ellen Wheeler]]), who would later fall in love with Stuart. The character was revealed to have [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. Through visits by now-Dr. Angie Hubbard, the show educated the public on how the disease was spread and how to prevent it. Cindy had contracted HIV from her husband, Fred, played by Mark Morrison who contracted it from sharing needles for drug use. Cindy is attacked by a vigilante hate group led by her niece, [[Skye Chandler]]. The tragedy of the attack shows the extremes of violence that occur every day to victims of the disease. Cindy marries Stuart and he adopts her son, Scott. She dies early in 1989 in one of the show's most watched episodes. ABC wanted changes at ''All My Children''. The show was getting about 6.5 million viewers per episode, but there was sentiment that the program had lost its unique sense of humor and was simply copying other soaps with [[action/adventure]] storylines. Efforts were made to bring the show back to the glory days of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n[[Felicia Minei Behr]] was hired as the new executive producer in early 1989. Having been a producer on [[Ryan's Hope]], Behr was familiar with ''All My Children'', having been an associate producer from 1970 to 1975. Among the stories featured was a baby storyline involving the characters of Adam, Brooke, Tad, and Dixie ([[Cady McClain]]). By this time, the show had also found a \"hit couple\" in Cecily and Nico (portrayed by [[Rosa Nevin]] and [[Maurice Benard]]), but Behr was unable to convince either to remain with the show, and the duo left at the end of 1989.\n\nABC was pleased with Behr; Nixon was as well, and decided her creation was safe in the hands of the new producer. Behr, however, made the unpopular decision to fire Peter Bergman (Cliff Warner) during this time, as well as Ellen Wheeler (Karen) and Robert Gentry (Ross Chandler). Bergman's departure was particularly frustrating to Debbi Morgan (who thought it was a cop-out by ABC on the promising interracial Angie/Cliff pairing; Morgan later defected to the new NBC soap opera ''[[Generations (U.S. TV series)|Generations]]'' in protest), Taylor Miller (who was misled when Behr approached her to bring back her character Nina; Miller was frustrated to find out she had only been brought back for two weeks to facilitate Bergman's departure: Cliff and Nina reunited, married yet again, and left Pine Valley, leaving Miller to lament to ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' that she felt it was going backward for both characters, and difficult emotionally to play), and Bergman himself. Behr then brought back fan favorite Opal Gardner, but instead of contacting Emmy winner Dorothy Lyman to reprise the role, Behr hired [[Jill Larson]]. Lyman later noted her disappointment in never being contacted about reprising the role.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nAt the time of Behr's hiring in early 1989, the show usually ranked around No. 4 in the ratings. By 1990, it had inched up to the No. 3 spot. Billy Clyde Tuggle returns to Pine Valley in 1990, after a ten-year absence (in prison). He proceeds to undo the lives of many in Pine Valley. He tells his daughter, Emily Ann Sago, that he is her natural father, devastating her with the truth that she was the product of rape. He dies tumbling over a bridge (with Tad Martin), ending the reign of one of Pine Valley's most evil and entertaining characters ever.\n\nABC chose [[Megan McTavish]], a former actress who had been on the writing team since 1987, to be its new head writer. She was officially promoted to that position in 1992, with Nixon serving as executive head writer. Stories such as Molly's leukemia, Ceara Connor's ([[Genie Francis]]) [[incest]], Mona's lung cancer, and Deconstruction (a story about racism), were all praised in soap opera magazines for their social conscience. Other storylines included the ''Who Killed Will Cortlandt?'' mystery, Willow Lake Acres (a both humorous and serious tale about the plight of the elderly in a fraudulent nursing home), and a tornado that rocked Pine Valley. Behr also helped craft a story re-exploring Erica's father, Eric Kane. It was revealed he had faked his own death. In a comical twist, Erica finds him working as a clown in a traveling circus.\n\nMcTavish was also instrumental in a major but still popular [[retroactive continuity]] (retcon) storyline in 1993. Shortly after being introduced, the audience soon learns [[Kendall Hart]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) is actually Erica's long-lost daughter. Kendall was conceived after Erica was raped on her 14th birthday by her father's actor friend Richard Fields. After she became pregnant, Erica gave her baby up for adoption to the Harts, a couple from Florida. Kendall comes to Pine Valley after finding out her birth mother is the famous Erica Kane. Kendall longs for Erica's approval<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steinback|first1=Sheila|title=Star of the Year 1994: AMC's Sarah Michelle Gellar|journal=Soap Opera Magazine|date=January 24, 1994}}</ref> but is also angry over her perceived feelings of being 'abandoned' at birth and comes to want payback against her mother.<ref name=\"Tracy\">{{cite book|author =Kathleen Tracy|title=The Girl's Got Bite: The Original Unauthorized Guide to Buffy's World ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlE1_oTihcUC&pg=PA63&dq=Kendall+Hart+soap+opera|isbn=0-312-31258-X|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2003|page=384}}</ref> Although they try to make their family work at first, Kendall acts out <ref>{{cite journal|title=Editor's Choice|journal=Soap Opera Digest|date=February 15, 1994}}</ref> and mother and daughter experience a painful, strained, and complicated relationship during this time in the series. The popular Gellar was proclaimed by some \"as the second coming of Erica\"<ref name=\"Tracy\" /> in her two years as Kendall Hart from 1993\u20131995 but left the show to pursue other acting opportunities. Producers ended up waiting at least six years before even contemplating to recast the role (which eventually went to [[Alicia Minshew]] in 2002).\n\nThe Santos, Dillon, Frye, and Keefer families were introduced during the 90s as well. Also, the [[Tad Martin and Dixie Cooney|Tad and Dixie]] pairing had become especially popular.<ref name=\"West1\">{{cite magazine|first=Abby |last=West |title=17 Great Soap Supercouples: Tad and Dixie |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-01-29 |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_15,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201164527/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0%2C%2C20174499_15%2C00.html |archivedate=February 1, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The show also had other couples with great followings during this time: [[Dimitri Marick and Erica Kane|Dimitri and Erica]] ([[Michael Nader]]),<ref name=\"West2\">{{cite magazine|first=Abby |last=West |title=17 Great Soap Supercouples: Erica and Dimitri |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-01-29 |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_10,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201164501/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0%2C%2C20174499_10%2C00.html |archivedate=February 1, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Trevor ([[James Kiberd]]) and Natalie ([[Kate Collins (actress)|Kate Collins]]), and Hayley ([[Kelly Ripa]]) and Brian (Gregory Gordon, [[Matt Borlenghi]], Brian L. Greene).\n\nBy the early/mid-1990s, some of McTavish's storytelling received criticism for being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines and the direction of the series. After the [[O.J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson trial]] preempted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and ''All My Children'' was no different. When Megan McTavish was fired from her head writing post in the spring, former head writer [[Lorraine Broderick]] was tapped by Behr to lead the team once again.\n\nBroderick's tenure under Behr was popular among critics and fans for returning ''All My Children'' to its socially relevant, character-driven roots. Her most significant successes were Erica's drug addiction story (with the character receiving treatment at the [[Betty Ford Center]]), and also the story of [[homophobia]] over a gay high school boy and a history teacher.<ref name=goliath.ecnext.com /> However, with the ratings still stagnant, ABC did not renew longtime executive producer Felicia Minei Behr's contract, and brought in [[Francesca James]] (who had previously won an Emmy award acting on the show as twins Kitty and Kelly). The storylines now included a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] arc with the popular [[Julia Santos|Noah and Julia]] ([[Keith Hamilton Cobb]] and [[Sydney Penny]]), a fantasy story for Myrtle featuring the \"real\" [[Santa Claus]], and finally a baby kidnapping story involving Erica.\n\nDespite winning three consecutive Daytime Emmys for writing during her tenure on ''All My Children'', Broderick was replaced in December 1997 by her predecessor, McTavish.

The town exists in the same fictional universe as other serial settings such as [[Llanview]] (''[[One Life to Live]]''), [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]] (''[[General Hospital]]'', ''[[Port Charles]]'', ''[[The Young Marrieds]]''), [[New York City]] (''[[Ryan's Hope]]'') and [[Corinth, Pennsylvania|Corinth]] (''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'').\n\n=== Crossovers ===\nIn 2000, ''All My Children'', was featured in a major crossover event, that encompassed all the then existing ABC Daytime soap lineup. [[Linda Dano]] brought her ''[[One Life to Live]]'' character [[Rae Cummings]], to Pine Valley, where she connected with her mother [[Myrtle Fargate]]. It was also revealed during that storyline, that longtime existing ''All My Children'' character [[Skye Chandler]], was Rae's daughter. Skye, who had spent time on ''[[One Life to Live]]'' from  1999-2001, then followed Rae to Port Charles, the setting of the soaps ''[[General Hospital]]'' and ''[[Port Charles]]'', where she became a member of the [[Quartermaine family]], and made appearances until 2012.\n\n''All My Children'' has featured several crossovers with other ABC soaps, including an extensive 2004 'baby switch' storyline with ''One Life to Live'' which featured crossovers of over 20 characters between the two shows. In 2011, AMC did a comedic crossover with the [[TV Land]] comedy ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', in which fictitious actress Victoria Chase (portrayed by [[Wendie Malick]] but credited as Chase) does a cameo appearance on AMC alongside Susan Lucci. In the ''Hot in Cleveland'' storyline, Chase and Lucci (portrayed as herself) are daytime-TV contemporaries and rivals.\n\nIn 2017, ''All My Children'' character [[Alexandra Devane]] appeared on ''[[General Hospital]]'', where she masqueraded as her sister [[Anna Devane]].\n\n== Ratings ==\n''For historical ratings information, see [[List of U.S. daytime soap opera ratings]]''\n\n;Years as No. 1 series\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!

He also wrote ''Where the Bright Waters Meet'' (1924) a classic book about [[fly fishing]].\n\n== Training ==\nPlunket Greene was born in [[Dublin]], the son of Richard Jonas Greene, a barrister, and [[Louisa Lilias Plunket Greene|Louisa Lilias Plunket]], granddaughter of [[William Plunket, 1st Baron Plunket|William Conyngham Plunket]], [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irishheritage.co.uk/harry-plunket-greene/ |title=Harry Plunket Greene |publisher=Irish Heritage |date= |accessdate=2020-04-03}}</ref> He was educated at [[Clifton College]] and initially expected to follow Law at [[Oxford University|Oxford]]. However, after he was 'smashed up' in a football accident he had a year's convalescence. Discovering his musical calling he studied under Arthur Barraclough in [[Dublin]] before attending the [[Stuttgart Conservatory]] for two years under Hromada in the early 1880s. He also studied in [[Florence]] with [[Luigi Vannuccini]] (a pupil of [[Francesco Lamperti]]), and in London with J. B. Welsh and Alfred Blume.<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924>Eaglefield-Hull 1924.</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\nHe made his debut in London (at the People's Palace, Mile End) in 1888, in [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'',<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> and in the next year appeared in [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''Redemption''. In 1890 he made operatic debuts as Commendatore in ''Don Giovanni'' and as the Duke of Verona in ''Romeo et Juliette'', at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]. Thereafter he elected to make his career in recital.\n\nIn oratorio, his first Festival appearance was at [[Worcester]] in 1890. Plunket Greene created the title part in [[Hubert Parry|Parry]]'s ''Job'', at the [[Gloucester Festival]] in 1892. This includes the ''Lamentation of Job'', an extremely long (28-page) and sustained oratorio scena. [[David Bispham]] said of his performances that he 'created the part and rendered it many times with superb dramatic feeling.'<ref>Bispham 1920, 159.</ref> In this, as in most of Parry's songs, Plunket Greene recognised the perfect declamation of Parry's writing, the accent upon word-values falling naturally and correctly in the music. As a result, he became the original exponent or dedicatee of many of the lyrical works of Parry,<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> and also of [[Battison Haynes]] (\"Off to Philadelphia\"), and of [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]. Stanford wrote ''[[Songs of the Sea (Stanford)|Songs of the Sea]]'' for him, and the singer also greatly admired Stanford's ''Cushendall'' and ''Irish Idyll'' cycles and the ''Three Cavalier Songs'' set to [[Robert Browning|Browning]]'s words. Although his voice was not exceptionally powerful he used it with great style, musicianship and intelligence.\n\nIn 1891 [[George Bernard Shaw]] found him 'fairly equal to the occasion in the wonderful duet' from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s Whitsuntide Canatata, ''O, Ewiges Feuer'', with the Bach Choir. In April 1892 (sharing the platform with [[Joseph Joachim]] and [[Franz Xaver Neruda]], [[Fanny Davies]], [[Carlo Alfredo Piatti|Alfredo Piatti]] and Agnes Zimmermann (piano)) he sang admirably in his first set ([[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Peter Cornelius]] and [[Robert Schumann]]) in a Monday Popular Concert, but made little of his second group. In November 1893 at the first of [[George Henschel]]'s London Symphony Orchestra concerts for the season he performed Stanford's new song, \"Prince Madoc's Farewell\", so patriotically 'that he once or twice almost burst into the next key.' Shaw's strictures on his diction were no doubt taken very seriously by the singer, who studied to make absolute clarity and naturalness of diction a central point of his teaching and example.<ref>Shaw 1932, i, 107, 129; ii, 73, 89; iii, 86\u201388.</ref>\n\nFrom early in his career Plunket Greene became a champion of ballad and song in the English language, including traditional Irish and English song, into the concert repertoire. Through his connections with Stanford, Parry, Vaughan Williams, [[Gervase Elwes]], and through the imitations or arrangements of Irish songs by [[Hamilton Harty]], [[Arthur Somervell]] or [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]] he was very active in promoting this movement in English and Anglo-Irish art-song. He did this not by succumbing to the imitation of country singing, but by investing whatever he sang with all the principles of good singing - of long and intelligent phrasing, clean, natural attack and diction, lively faithfulness to rhythm and timing, and the powerful engagement of imagination in interpretation. These values were explained in his 1912 book ''Interpretation in Song'' which ran through many editions and rapidly became a classic. His advocacy of art-song was indefatigable. His early accompanist Henry Bird gained an appointment as accompanist to the Chappell Ballad Concerts after his very successful partnership with Plunket Greene in the Hungarian Songs of [[Francis Korbay]].<ref>Harold Simpson, 'Ch. XI: Plunket Greene, and Stanford's Irish songs' in ''A Century of Ballads, 1810-1910'' (Mills and Boon, London 1910), [http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/century-ballads/century-of-ballads%20-%200337.htm pp. 237-247].</ref>\n\n== Recitals \u2013 partnership with Leonard Borwick ==\nDuring the 1890s (from 1893) Plunket Greene became one of the foremost British performers and interpreters of the German Lieder, especially of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]. This he did in association with the English pianist [[Leonard Borwick]] (the brother of a schoolfriend), a Frankfurt pupil of [[Clara Schumann]]'s noted for his powerful rhythmic delivery, and who (like his fellow-pupil [[Fanny Davies]]) was closely involved in the London work of [[Joseph Joachim]]. Plunket Greene and Borwick formed a musical friendship which lasted until Borwick's death.\n\nPlunket Greene was touring in America in spring 1893 and wrote to Borwick suggesting they should deliver a song and pianoforte recital in London, unlike the more usual form of miscellaneous concert with a mixed company. The first recital was in [[St James's Hall]] in December 1893, followed by a tour throughout the country, and this pattern was repeated for ten years. Borwick played his own programme as well as accompanying, but after a couple of seasons [[Samuel Liddle]] came in as accompanist. Pioneering this model of the recital, they gave a lead to that movement in London. Their rules were to maintain musicianship, avoid the glare of publicity, and never to take care of hands or voice.\n\nOn 11 January 1895 at St James's Hall, Borwick and Greene gave the first complete public performance of [[Robert Schumann]]'s ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' to be heard in London. Their musical partnership was still active in 1913, but the demands of their separate tours became so great by the early 1900s that they agreed not to continue their former recital programme unless it could be done whole-heartedly. Plunket Greene toured especially in the United States, where he considered the audiences especially attentive and appreciative, and in Germany. He also liked northern English audiences better than southern ones, and liked singing to audiences of public schoolboys.<ref>Plunket Greene 1934 (''Blue Danube to Shannon''), 74\u201389.</ref>\n\n== Gerontius and after ==\nPlunket Greene was a friend of [[Edward Elgar]]'s, and appeared in his Malvern Concert Club events.<ref>Young 1956, 126\u2013127.</ref> He was the original baritone in the first (October 1900) performance (Birmingham Festival) of Elgar's ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]'', alongside [[Marie Brema]] (angel) and [[Edward Lloyd (tenor)|Edward Lloyd]] (soul), under [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]]. In June 1900 Elgar had written to [[August Jaeger]], \"he sings both bass bits and won't they suit him. Gosh.\"<ref>Young 1956, 84.</ref> Although his recordings, and some commentators, suggest the voice was not a large one,<ref>e.g. Eaglefield-Hull 1924.</ref> it must have been capable of sustaining and projecting a considerable tone at this time, for both the ''Gerontius'' baritone solos require this. Moreover, for this most personal of his works, Elgar must have felt some real aptness in the choice.\n\n[[Arthur Somervell]]'s song-cyle, on [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s 'Maud' was originally produced (with twelve songs) in 1898 and was championed by Plunket Greene. In 1899 he married Gwendolen Maud, the youngest daughter of [[Hubert Parry]],<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> and their first son was born in 1901. He also gave the first performance of [[Arthur Somervell]]'s ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]'' cycle, at the [[Aeolian Hall (London)|Aeolian Hall]] on 3 February 1904, and so had the distinction of being the first to sing settings of [[Alfred Edward Housman|A. E. Housman]]'s lyrics, which afterwards became so fundamental an inspiration to the composers associated with the English song revival of that period.\n\nPlunket Greene included a selection from the ''Songs of Travel'' by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in recital in February 1905. Then (or soon afterwards) the composer heard him and dedicated the songs to him, and Greene afterwards quoted from them, and from ''Silent Noon'' (from the ''House of Life'' cycle), in his work on ''Interpretation in Song''. Greene was responsible for establishing these songs in the English concert repertoire, where he was constantly attempting to raise the standard and quality of appreciation of English song through his programming.<ref>Rufus Hallmark, 'Robert Louis Stevenson, Ralph Vaughan Williams and their ''Songs of Travel'',' in Brian Adams and Robin Wells (Eds.), ''Vaughan Williams Essays'' Vol 44 (Ashgate Publishing, 2003), pp. 135, 138.</ref>\n\nHe supported [[Gervase Elwes]] from the start of his professional career and was his lifelong friend. At Elwes' audition for the [[Royal College of Music]] in 1903 Greene wrote to encourage him with the favourable reactions of Parry and Stanford,<ref>Elwes 1935, 127.</ref> and soon afterwards put him up for the [[Savile Club]] in London.<ref>Elwes 1935, 155.</ref> In 1906, he joined the party at [[Brigg]] to sing in the second festival there organised by Elwes and [[Percy Grainger]], and declared his wish to be in many more of them.<ref>Elwes 1935, 165.</ref> When Elwes died in 1921, Greene wrote \"I always felt he was the man I most looked up to.\"<ref>Elwes 1935, 281\u2013282.</ref> 'In the ''St Matthew Passion'', (he) made us feel that he of all men was best fitted to tell us the greatest story in the world.'<ref>Elwes 1935, 296\u2013297.</ref>\n\nPlunkett Greene's recordings were made first for the [[Gramophone Company]], in 1904\u20131906. He included folk-songs in his recitals, according to them the same values of diction, phrasing, rhythm, and interpretative sincerity which he brought to art-songs. In later years, as he moved into the field of song-lecturing, he did great service to the cause of British folk-music.<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> His last recordings were made by the electric process for [[Columbia Records]]: his late recording of 'Poor old horse' is an affecting example.\n\nOn 24 January 1910 he appeared in the memorial concert at [[Queen's Hall]] for August Jaeger (Elgar's 'Nimrod'), singing a group of songs by [[Walford Davies]], and Hans Sachs's monologue from ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg|Die Meistersinger]]''.<ref>Elkin 1944, 41.</ref> He made his first appearance in [[Henry Wood]]'s [[The Proms|Promenade Concerts]] at the Queen's Hall in October 1914 singing Stanford's ''Songs of the Sea'' with the [[Alexandra Palace]] Choral Society.<ref>Wood 1946, 295: Elkin 1944, 70.</ref> He had declined to fulfil an engagement to sing them there for the ''Stock Exchange Orchestral Society'' in 1907 on hearing that they still used the high English [[Pitch (music)|Concert pitch]].<ref>Elkin 1944, 104.</ref>\n\n== Competitions and festivals, teaching ==\nIn his later years Plunket Greene was busily involved in the organisation of music events and in teaching and administration. In 1923 he made his fifteenth voyage across the Atlantic (the first had been in 1893), on this occasion to act as a judge in Musical Competitions throughout Canada. From New York he went to [[Toronto]] by train to join [[Granville Bantock]]. This was to be at the five Festivals of [[Ontario]], Manitoba, [[Saskatchewan]], Alberta and [[British Columbia]]. This was the first Ontario Festival (Toronto) (with [[Robert Watkin-Mills]] and [[Boris Hambourg]] also in attendance), the 6th in [[Winnipeg]] (with [[Herbert Witherspoon]] and [[Cecil Forsyth]] assisting), where the Earl Grey trophy was competed for, the 16th in [[Edmonton]] (Alberta), with choirs from [[Lethbridge]] and [[Calgary]], and in [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] they were with [[Herbert Howells]]. The promotion and encouragement of these events provided not only a great spectacle and opportunity for music-making, but also infused a competitive spirit into the works of choirs, singers and instrumentalists in the award of prizes (in the tradition begun at [[Kendal]], UK in c.1889), tending to the encouragement of excellence. Plunket Greene repeated the experience in Saskatchewan in 1931, together with [[Harold Samuel]], [[Maurice Jacobson]] and Hugh Roberton.<ref>''From Blue Danube to Shannon'', Chapters II and VII.</ref>\n\nAmong those to profit from his teaching was Sir [[Keith Falkner]], whom Plunket Greene coached in his famous interpretation of the ''Lamentation of Job'' in [[Hubert Parry|Parry's]] oratorio ''Job''.<ref>Brook 1958, 76.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nPlunkett Greene married [[Gwendoline Maud Parry Greene|Gwendolen Maud Parry]], [[Hubert Parry]]\u2019s younger daughter, in 1899. The couple had three children: [[Richard Plunket Greene]] (born 1901), [[David Plunket Greene]] (born 1904) and [[Olivia Plunket Greene]] (born 1907) who never married, despite a colorful youth. The marriage was an unhappy one, however, and they separated in 1920. Plunket Greene died on 19 August 1936, aged 71. He was buried in the churchyard of [[Hurstbourne Priors]], near the graves of his two sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plunketgreene.hampshire.org.uk/Biography.htm|title=Biography|accessdate=17 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803035057/http://www.plunketgreene.hampshire.org.uk/Biography.htm|archivedate=3 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHis grandson Alexander Plunkett Greene married fashion designer [[Mary Quant]] and had a son Orlando.\n\n== Publications ==\n*''Interpretation in Song'' (London: [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], 1912)\n*''Pilot and other stories'' (London: [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], 1916)\n*''Where the Bright Waters Meet ''(London: [[Lagard\u00e8re Publishing|Philip Allan]], 1924)\n*''From Blue Danube to Shannon'' (London: [[Lagard\u00e8re Publishing|Philip Allan]], 1935)\n*''Charles Villiers Stanford'' (London: [[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]], 1935)\n\n== Recordings ==\nHarry Plunket Greene recorded songs both for the Gramophone Company and Columbia Records.\n\n'''Published recordings for the Gramophone Company''' (1904\u201308):\n\n*2-42776 Abschied (Schubert). 22 January 1904; matrix 4891b\n*3-2016 Off to Philadelphia ([[Battison Haynes]]). 22 January 1904; matrix 4892b\n*3-2017 a) Mary (Goodheart) b) Quick, we have but a second (Stanford). 22 January 1904; matrix 4894b\n*3-2018 Father O'Flynn (arr Stanford). 22 January 1904; matrix 4894b \n*3-2059 (a) Eva Toole (b) Trottin' to the fair (Stanford). 14 February 1904; matrix 5065b\n*3-2060 The Donovans (Needham). 14 February 1904; matrix 5067b\n*3-2089 Over here (Wood). 4 January 1904; matrix 4779b\n*3-2333\ta) The happy farmer (Somervell) b) Black Sheila of the silver eye (Harty). 30 May 1905; matrix 2114e\n*3-2334 The gentle maiden. 30 May 1905; matrix 2116e\n*3-2335 Little red fox (arr.

He also gave the first performance of [[Arthur Somervell]]'s ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]'' cycle, at the [[Aeolian Hall (London)|Aeolian Hall]] on 3 February 1904, and so had the distinction of being the first to sing settings of [[Alfred Edward Housman|A. E. Housman]]'s lyrics, which afterwards became so fundamental an inspiration to the composers associated with the English song revival of that period.\n\nPlunket Greene included a selection from the ''Songs of Travel'' by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in recital in February 1905. Then (or soon afterwards) the composer heard him and dedicated the songs to him, and Greene afterwards quoted from them, and from ''Silent Noon'' (from the ''House of Life'' cycle), in his work on ''Interpretation in Song''. Greene was responsible for establishing these songs in the English concert repertoire, where he was constantly attempting to raise the standard and quality of appreciation of English song through his programming.<ref>Rufus Hallmark, 'Robert Louis Stevenson, Ralph Vaughan Williams and their ''Songs of Travel'',' in Brian Adams and Robin Wells (Eds.), ''Vaughan Williams Essays'' Vol 44 (Ashgate Publishing, 2003), pp. 135, 138.</ref>\n\nHe supported [[Gervase Elwes]] from the start of his professional career and was his lifelong friend. At Elwes' audition for the [[Royal College of Music]] in 1903 Greene wrote to encourage him with the favourable reactions of Parry and Stanford,<ref>Elwes 1935, 127.</ref> and soon afterwards put him up for the [[Savile Club]] in London.<ref>Elwes 1935, 155.</ref> In 1906, he joined the party at [[Brigg]] to sing in the second festival there organised by Elwes and [[Percy Grainger]], and declared his wish to be in many more of them.<ref>Elwes 1935, 165.</ref> When Elwes died in 1921, Greene wrote \"I always felt he was the man I most looked up to.\"<ref>Elwes 1935, 281\u2013282.</ref> 'In the ''St Matthew Passion'', (he) made us feel that he of all men was best fitted to tell us the greatest story in the world.'<ref>Elwes 1935, 296\u2013297.</ref>\n\nPlunkett Greene's recordings were made first for the [[Gramophone Company]], in 1904\u20131906. He included folk-songs in his recitals, according to them the same values of diction, phrasing, rhythm, and interpretative sincerity which he brought to art-songs. In later years, as he moved into the field of song-lecturing, he did great service to the cause of British folk-music.<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> His last recordings were made by the electric process for [[Columbia Records]]: his late recording of 'Poor old horse' is an affecting example.\n\nOn 24 January 1910 he appeared in the memorial concert at [[Queen's Hall]] for August Jaeger (Elgar's 'Nimrod'), singing a group of songs by [[Walford Davies]], and Hans Sachs's monologue from ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg|Die Meistersinger]]''.<ref>Elkin 1944, 41.</ref> He made his first appearance in [[Henry Wood]]'s [[The Proms|Promenade Concerts]] at the Queen's Hall in October 1914 singing Stanford's ''Songs of the Sea'' with the [[Alexandra Palace]] Choral Society.<ref>Wood 1946, 295: Elkin 1944, 70.</ref> He had declined to fulfil an engagement to sing them there for the ''Stock Exchange Orchestral Society'' in 1907 on hearing that they still used the high English [[Pitch (music)|Concert pitch]].<ref>Elkin 1944, 104.</ref>\n\n== Competitions and festivals, teaching ==\nIn his later years Plunket Greene was busily involved in the organisation of music events and in teaching and administration. In 1923 he made his fifteenth voyage across the Atlantic (the first had been in 1893), on this occasion to act as a judge in Musical Competitions throughout Canada. From New York he went to [[Toronto]] by train to join [[Granville Bantock]]. This was to be at the five Festivals of [[Ontario]], Manitoba, [[Saskatchewan]], Alberta and [[British Columbia]]. This was the first Ontario Festival (Toronto) (with [[Robert Watkin-Mills]] and [[Boris Hambourg]] also in attendance), the 6th in [[Winnipeg]] (with [[Herbert Witherspoon]] and [[Cecil Forsyth]] assisting), where the Earl Grey trophy was competed for, the 16th in [[Edmonton]] (Alberta), with choirs from [[Lethbridge]] and [[Calgary]], and in [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] they were with [[Herbert Howells]]. The promotion and encouragement of these events provided not only a great spectacle and opportunity for music-making, but also infused a competitive spirit into the works of choirs, singers and instrumentalists in the award of prizes (in the tradition begun at [[Kendal]], UK in c.1889), tending to the encouragement of excellence. Plunket Greene repeated the experience in Saskatchewan in 1931, together with [[Harold Samuel]], [[Maurice Jacobson]] and Hugh Roberton.<ref>''From Blue Danube to Shannon'', Chapters II and VII.</ref>\n\nAmong those to profit from his teaching was Sir [[Keith Falkner]], whom Plunket Greene coached in his famous interpretation of the ''Lamentation of Job'' in [[Hubert Parry|Parry's]] oratorio ''Job''.<ref>Brook 1958, 76.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nPlunkett Greene married [[Gwendoline Maud Parry Greene|Gwendolen Maud Parry]], [[Hubert Parry]]\u2019s younger daughter, in 1899. The couple had three children: [[Richard Plunket Greene]] (born 1901), [[David Plunket Greene]] (born 1904) and [[Olivia Plunket Greene]] (born 1907) who never married, despite a colorful youth. The marriage was an unhappy one, however, and they separated in 1920. Plunket Greene died on 19 August 1936, aged 71. He was buried in the churchyard of [[Hurstbourne Priors]], near the graves of his two sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plunketgreene.hampshire.org.uk/Biography.htm|title=Biography|accessdate=17 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803035057/http://www.plunketgreene.hampshire.org.uk/Biography.htm|archivedate=3 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHis grandson Alexander Plunkett Greene married fashion designer [[Mary Quant]] and had a son Orlando.\n\n== Publications ==\n*''Interpretation in Song'' (London: [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], 1912)\n*''Pilot and other stories'' (London: [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], 1916)\n*''Where the Bright Waters Meet ''(London: [[Lagard\u00e8re Publishing|Philip Allan]], 1924)\n*''From Blue Danube to Shannon'' (London: [[Lagard\u00e8re Publishing|Philip Allan]], 1935)\n*''Charles Villiers Stanford'' (London: [[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]], 1935)\n\n== Recordings ==\nH.P.G. recorded songs both for Gramophone Company and Columbia records.\n\n''Published recordings for the Gramophone Company'' (1904\u201308):\n\n*2-42776 Abschied (Schubert). 22 January 1904; matrix 4891b\n*3-2016 Off to Philadelphia ([[Battison Haynes]]). 22 January 1904; matrix 4892b\n*3-2017 a) Mary (Goodheart) b) Quick, we have but a second (Stanford). 22 January 1904; matrix 4894b\n*3-2018 Father O'Flynn (arr Stanford). 22 January 1904; matrix 4894b \n*3-2059 (a) Eva Toole (b) Trottin' to the fair (Stanford). 14 February 1904; matrix 5065b\n*3-2060 The Donovans (Needham). 14 February 1904; matrix 5067b\n*3-2089 Over here (Wood). 4 January 1904; matrix 4779b\n*3-2333\ta) The happy farmer (Somervell) b) Black Sheila of the silver eye (Harty). 30 May 1905; matrix 2114e\n*3-2334 The gentle maiden. 30 May 1905; matrix 2116e\n*3-2335 Little red fox (arr.

It is the fourth series in the [[Beverly Hills, 90210 franchise|''Beverly Hills, 90210'' franchise]] created by [[Darren Star]]. The series was produced by [[CBS Television Studios]].\n\nLike its [[Beverly Hills, 90210|predecessor]], the show follows the lives of several wealthy students attending West Beverly Hills High School in the upscale and star-studded community of [[Beverly Hills, California]]. The show later focuses on the same group of friends when they graduate and begin their lives in the adult world. Some attend college at California University, while others begin exploring avenues beyond post-secondary education.\n\nThe show originally revolved around the Wilson family, including new Beverly Hills residents [[Annie Wilson]] ([[Shenae Grimes]]) and [[Dixon Wilson]] ([[Tristan Wilds]]). Their father, [[Harrison Wilson]] ([[Rob Estes]]) has returned from [[Wichita, Kansas]], to his Beverly Hills childhood home with his family to care for his mother, former television and theater actress [[Tabitha Wilson]] ([[Jessica Walter]]), who has a drinking problem and clashes with his wife [[Debbie Wilson (90210)|Debbie Wilson]] ([[Lori Loughlin]]). Annie and Dixon struggle to adjust to their new lives while making friends and yet adhering to their parents' wishes.\n\nDuring the first two seasons, cast members from the original series made appearances, including [[Jennie Garth]], [[Shannen Doherty]], [[Ann Gillespie]], [[Tori Spelling]] and [[Joe E. Tata]]. After the second season, however, they were not featured and were rarely mentioned. The primary connection between the two series was the new series' character of Erin Silver ([[Jessica Stroup]]), the half-sister of Kelly Taylor and David Silver from the original series.\n\n== Series overview ==\n{{Main list|List of 90210 episodes}}\n{{:List of 90210 episodes}}\n\n{{Long plot|section|plural=yes|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Season 1 (2008\u201309) ===\n{{Main|90210 (season 1)}}\n\n[[File:90210 season 1 inter title.png|thumb|right|Inter-title used in the first season of the series]]\n\nTracy has a daughter of her own, [[Naomi Clark]], who dates jock [[Ethan Ward]], brief rival of Dixon, whom she soon breaks up with. Annie and Ethan then pursue a relationship after having dated the summer prior to Annie moving to Beverly Hills, when Annie was visiting her grandmother for the summer. Both girls alternate between being friends, enemies, in a love triangle, and almost sisters, due to their parents' child. Their respective mothers find themselves in a love triangle of their own after Tracy's marriage to Charles Clark implodes (which Naomi takes quite badly) and she appears to want Harry back. Naomi's fight with Annie forces her out of the crowd after she starts her many plots of manipulation and revenge when she uses Annie's ex-boyfriend from Kansas, Jason, as a weapon to get back at her for hiding her relationship with Ethan. She becomes friends with a group of older girls and starts flirting with Ozzie, a rather alternative student, and later becomes attracted to a bartender named [[Liam Court|Liam]], whom she soon finds out is actually her age and becomes a student at West Beverly High. Meanwhile, Ethan and Annie's relationship hits the rocks as he begins to rethink his life after a car accident and gets more or less attracted to Rhonda, the girl he hit. Soon Naomi and Liam begin a romance, and once she becomes friends with Annie again, Liam's repetitive indecisiveness begins as he starts to pursue the both of them.\n\nNaomi's best friend, fallen starlet [[Adrianna Tate-Duncan]], battles a [[Addiction#Drug addiction|drug addiction]]. This gets her into trouble when Harry decides to raid the school, thanks to the help of a cop, Kimberly McIntyre, under cover as a student. Kimberly begins a relationship with teacher/[[lacrosse]] coach [[Ryan Matthews (90210)|Ryan Matthews]], which gets him into trouble with the school. Guilt-ridden, Kimberly does her best to solve the case, giving Ryan his job back, although he takes a leave of absence to rethink his life, and Adrianna lands in [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]], after almost getting Naomi in legal troubles as she took the blame for the drugs. There, she begins a relationship with [[Navid Shirazi]], head of the school's paper and Dixon's best friend, who paid for her rehab. Navid and Adrianna are in completely different groups in high school. Adrianna was much more outgoing and popular while Navid was more focused on his studies. Navid's dream was to have an opportunity to date Adrianna. Although at first she only does it to \"repay\" him, they start to genuinely care about each other. Adrianna later discovers she is [[teenage pregnancy|pregnant]] as a result of her promiscuity while she was addicted. After telling Navid of her pregnancy, he breaks up with her. It is later revealed that the father of Adrianna's child is Ty, although it is unclear when they slept together. She and Navid get back together when he realizes that even though she is a mess he can't get over her, and get engaged, although he alienates his family when he tells them that the child is not his and gets upset when Adrianna reveals her daughter is Ty's. Navid's family is very close knit and is in someways conservative. This is only applies to some areas of life, seeing that his dad runs an adult entertainment business.\n\nAnother featured character is [[Erin Silver (90210)|Erin Silver]] (who goes by her last name), [[Kelly Taylor (90210)|Kelly Taylor]] and [[Characters of Beverly Hills, 90210#David Silver|David Silver]]'s half sister and Naomi's former best friend, until Silver's father's affair is revealed by Naomi, although she eventually reconciles her friendship with Naomi. She quickly befriends Annie and starts dating Dixon, who is somewhat taken aback by her not-so-90210 lifestyle, as she is a virgin who doesn't care about popularity. In a multi-episode arc that culminated in a very special episode, it is revealed that Silver has [[bipolar disorder]]. Kelly Taylor is now a guidance counselor at West Beverly and has a son named Sammy. Kelly becomes Silver's guardian after their mother proves to be an inadequate caretaker for Silver due to her [[alcoholism]]. Kelly briefly dates Ryan, but discovers that he also slept with Brenda, re-creating the rift between the two friends. Following Brenda's discovery that she cannot have children, however, the women are drawn together in an accord once again.\n\nAt the prom, Adrianna goes into labor. She gives birth to a daughter whom she gives up for adoption. It is also revealed that Brenda has adopted a child from China. Ethan begins to realize his feelings for Silver, which leads to a confrontation with Dixon and a kiss with Silver. At Naomi and Jen's (her sister) after-prom party, Liam sleeps with Jen. He is mad that Naomi told Jen about his past: he wanted to keep it a secret. However, he was not aware that Jen was Naomi's sister, and upon finding out is horrified. Naomi finds out about it but thinks that Annie was with Liam, not Jen. This culminates in a major fight between Annie and Naomi where Annie is shunned by her peers, runs away, gets in her car drunk and accidentally [[Hit and run (vehicular)|runs over a man]]. This is a suspenseful way to end the season and definitely brings plot twist seeing that Annie is not sure whether or not this man survived.\n\n===Season 2 (2009\u201310)===\n{{Main|90210 (season 2)}}\n\n[[File:90210splogo.jpg|thumb|right|Intertitle used in the remaining seasons of the series]]\n\nSeason two begins with the end of [[summer school]]. Naomi unknowingly dates a married man in an attempt to get over Liam, who shows up at West Beverly on the first day of school after being absent for the entire summer. Silver and Dixon get back together, but break up when he finds out Silver kissed Ethan. It is also revealed that Ethan has decided to stay in Montana with his father. Adrianna is desperate to become a normal teenager, giving up acting, and, much to Navid's dismay, their relationship is put under further pressure with the arrival of [[Teddy Montgomery]], Adrianna's ex-boyfriend (to whom Adrianna lost her virginity). Meanwhile, the emotionally distant and guilt-ridden Annie has cut herself from society as much as possible, contributing to a growing discord between her and her brother, who is angry at her for sending him to summer school. Annie begins to date Jasper, which began as a guilt-ridden friendship but later turned into a relationship. Jasper is different from any other boy Annie has dated. He is more quiet and mysterious compared to her past boyfriends. Dixon meets a girl named Sasha when he begins his DJing career and is performing near her in a yacht, to whom he lies about his real age.

This is what Liam wants, and their relationship becomes more stable; however, when Naomi is forced to come clean over false rumors she spread claiming that she was [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] by a teacher, Mr. Cannon, Liam decides that he needs a break from her. During this time, Annie and Liam become closer and he consoles her after she overhears her mother, Debbie, confessing to her father, Harry, that she kissed her yoga instructor. His consolation causes Annie to believe that Liam is flirting with her, but realizing that this was not his intent, Annie instead advises Liam to stay with Naomi, as she does not want to ruin her friendship again over a boy.

This discouraging behavior was a result of Teddy being so insecure with himself being gay. With all that going on in school, Adrianna is driving back from a summer of touring with the pop star, Javier. The two become a couple until Navid reveals to Adrianna that he has never stopped loving her, and she dumps Javier for Navid. Although he initially resolves to get her back, Javier becomes angered by this. He tells her that her singing career is over, before dying in a car crash, which Adrianna survives. She steals Javier's song book and performs one of his songs at his memorial service, which becomes a hit. She is then blackmailed by Javier's uncle, Victor, who becomes her manager and takes a huge portion of her earnings and forces her to do some things she finds uncomfortable, such as taking half naked photos and forming a snobby famous image that did not exist before. Navid, realizing the blackmail, asks Adrianna not to give in to the threats of Victor. Adrianna decides to take control of her career from Victor after seeing herself on the cover of a magazine. She begins to treat Victor badly and starts alienating Navid and her friends.

When he succeeds, taking her virginity, both of them find out, leaving Ivy upset with her mother. Dixon breaks up with Ivy out of fear after finding out from his ex-girlfriend Sasha that he may be [[HIV]] positive, though he later tests negative (Oscar had bribed Sasha to tell Dixon this in order to make him leave Ivy so that he could make a move). Dixon and Ivy get back together, but Dixon then finds out that Oscar took Ivy's virginity on the night she and Dixon had argued and the two break up again. Naomi starts to fall for Oscar, even though Ivy has warned her of his actions. When he offers to be her boyfriend, she declines. However, unluckily for Naomi, Mr. Cannon is waiting for her in her hotel room when she returns from Adrianna's Christmas party. Mr. Cannon holds Naomi hostage and invites Silver to come over. Once she arrives, Mr. Cannon ties her up as well and tells the girls of his plan to prove his innocence and go to the bank to drain Naomi's trust fund. Silver and Naomi gang up and attack Mr. Cannon. Naomi wants to slit his throat but Silver talks her out of it and calls the police.\n\nLiam reconciles with Charlie after a heart-to-heart conversation in which they discuss the [[physical abuse]] they endured as children.

The ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' creator, [[Darren Star]], was announced not to be involved with the project. The only surviving element from the original series was believed to be [[Creative Artists Agency]], the talent agency which conceived the spin-off idea. ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' creator [[Rob Thomas (writer)|Rob Thomas]] was in negotiations to write the pilot and [[Mark Piznarski]] was in talks to direct it.\n\n===Development===\nA detailed breakdown of the pilot written by Thomas was released on March 17, 2008, containing information on the plot and characters which would be in the series. None of the characters were related to the original series of ''90210'' which again aired a few years before except Erin Silver played by Jessica Stroup; however, the new series' featured a similar premise: a family with two teenagers who recently moved from the Midwest to Beverly Hills. To reflect the situation at the Beverly Hills school, where around 40 percent of the students were of Persian descent, a student named Navid Shirazi was created. Thomas intended to introduce The Peach Pit, the diner from ''Beverly Hills, 90210'', but noted that it would not be featured in the pilot. The writer considered giving the siblings a job at a movie theater, as he did not want them to use their parents' credit cards. Thomas revealed that there were plans to reintroduce one of the original cast members, but had not met with any of them to discuss a role. Thomas later elaborated the producers wanted to see \"as many of the original cast members as possible\", but were careful not to \"parade them all out in the pilot\".\n\nOn April 14, 2008, Thomas announced that he was sidelining the series to focus on his two pilots for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah were hired as the new executive producers and wrote a new version of the script in late April. Sachs said that although Thomas had a \"great script\", their version of the script was edgier. Judah said that they were trying to ground their script in reality, with real character stories and emotional stories. The writers wanted the audience to relate to the characters' problems, which they wanted to be truthful and emotional, but also comedic. The pair were interested in telling several stories simultaneously, featuring many characters.<ref name=\"sachsinter\" /> The pair changed the surname of the main family from Mills to Wilson, along with changing the name of the mother from Celia to Debbie. The pair also told reporters that they would be adding their \"comedic impulses\" to the script.<ref name=\"tvguidepilot\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/Fall-TV-Press-12658.aspx|title=Fall TV Press Tour: More ''90210'' Deets|accessdate=January 28, 2009|date=July 19, 2008|work=[[TV Guide (magazine)|TV Guide]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202094948/http://www.tvguide.com/news/Fall-TV-Press-12658.aspx| archivedate=February 2, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Sachs and Judah found the parents to be an important part of the series, and designed to be contemporary parents.<ref name=\"sachsinter\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/arts/television/31sach.html?pagewanted=print|title=Gabe Sachs, executive producer, ''90210''|accessdate=January 28, 2009|author=Itzkoff, Dave|date=August 31, 2008|work=The New York Times| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095712/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/arts/television/31sach.html?pagewanted=print| archivedate=October 6, 2014| url-status= live}}</ref> Since the producers were both fathers, they designed the script to include more prominent adult story lines and a strong point of view on parenting.

The characters were a hit. After disagreeing with the network executives over the series' storylines, Sachs and Judah ended their tenure as producers. The CW wanted the series to have a female perspective and focus more on teenage life and glamour; however, Judah and Sachs were more comfortable writing for men, featuring family stories. The studio brought in [[Rebecca Rand Kirshner Sinclair]], co-executive producer of the popular show ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', to revamp the failing ''90210''. Sinclair is largely credited for saving the show, which had steady ratings in its third season. For the remainder of the first season, Judah worked in post-production, including editing and music supervision, while Sachs ran the production on set.

It is the fourth series in the [[Beverly Hills, 90210 franchise|''Beverly Hills, 90210'' franchise]] created by [[Darren Star]]. The series was produced by [[CBS Television Studios]].\n\nLike its [[Beverly Hills, 90210|predecessor]], the show follows the lives of several wealthy students attending West Beverly Hills High School in the upscale and star-studded community of [[Beverly Hills, California]]. The show later focuses on the same group of friends when they graduate and begin their lives in the adult world. Some attend college at California University, while others begin exploring avenues beyond post-secondary education.\n\nThe show originally revolved around the Wilson family, including new Beverly Hills residents [[Annie Wilson]] ([[Shenae Grimes]]) and [[Dixon Wilson]] ([[Tristan Wilds]]). Their father, [[Harrison Wilson]] ([[Rob Estes]]) has returned from [[Wichita, Kansas]], to his Beverly Hills childhood home with his family to care for his mother, former television and theater actress [[Tabitha Wilson]] ([[Jessica Walter]]), who has a drinking problem and clashes with his wife [[Debbie Wilson (90210)|Debbie Wilson]] ([[Lori Loughlin]]). Annie and Dixon struggle to adjust to their new lives while making friends and yet adhering to their parents' wishes.\n\nDuring the first two seasons, cast members from the original series made appearances, including [[Jennie Garth]], [[Shannen Doherty]], [[Ann Gillespie]], [[Tori Spelling]] and [[Joe E. Tata]]. After the second season, however, they were not featured and were rarely mentioned. The primary connection between the two series was the new series' character of Erin Silver ([[Jessica Stroup]]), the half-sister of Kelly Taylor and David Silver from the original series.\n\n== Series overview ==\n{{Main list|List of 90210 episodes}}\n{{:List of 90210 episodes}}\n\n{{Long plot|section|plural=yes|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Season 1 (2008\u201309) ===\n{{Main|90210 (season 1)}}\n\n[[File:90210 season 1 inter title.png|thumb|right|Inter-title used in the first season of the series]]\n\nTracy has a daughter of her own, [[Naomi Clark]], who dates jock [[Ethan Ward]], brief rival of Dixon, whom she soon breaks up with. Annie and Ethan then pursue a relationship after having dated the summer prior to Annie moving to Beverly Hills, when Annie was visiting her grandmother for the summer. Both girls alternate between being friends, enemies, in a love triangle, and almost sisters, due to their parents' child. Their respective mothers find themselves in a love triangle of their own after Tracy's marriage to Charles Clark implodes (which Naomi takes quite badly) and she appears to want Harry back. Naomi's fight with Annie forces her out of the crowd after she starts her many plots of manipulation and revenge when she uses Annie's ex-boyfriend from Kansas, Jason, as a weapon to get back at her for hiding her relationship with Ethan. She becomes friends with a group of older girls and starts flirting with Ozzie, a rather alternative student, and later becomes attracted to a bartender named [[Liam Court|Liam]], whom she soon finds out is actually her age and becomes a student at West Beverly High. Meanwhile, Ethan and Annie's relationship hits the rocks as he begins to rethink his life after a car accident and gets more or less attracted to Rhonda, the girl he hit. Soon Naomi and Liam begin a romance, and once she becomes friends with Annie again, Liam's repetitive indecisiveness begins as he starts to pursue the both of them.\n\nNaomi's best friend, fallen starlet [[Adrianna Tate-Duncan]], battles a [[Addiction#Drug addiction|drug addiction]]. This gets her into trouble when Harry decides to raid the school, thanks to the help of a cop, Kimberly McIntyre, under cover as a student. Kimberly begins a relationship with teacher/[[lacrosse]] coach [[Ryan Matthews (90210)|Ryan Matthews]], which gets him into trouble with the school. Guilt-ridden, Kimberly does her best to solve the case, giving Ryan his job back, although he takes a leave of absence to rethink his life, and Adrianna lands in [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]], after almost getting Naomi in legal troubles as she took the blame for the drugs. There, she begins a relationship with [[Navid Shirazi]], head of the school's paper and Dixon's best friend, who paid for her rehab. Navid and Adrianna are in completely different groups in high school. Adrianna was much more outgoing and popular while Navid was more focused on his studies. Navid's dream was to have an opportunity to date Adrianna. Although at first she only does it to \"repay\" him, they start to genuinely care about each other. Adrianna later discovers she is [[teenage pregnancy|pregnant]] as a result of her promiscuity while she was addicted. After telling Navid of her pregnancy, he breaks up with her. It is later revealed that the father of Adrianna's child is Ty, although it is unclear when they slept together. She and Navid get back together when he realizes that even though she is a mess he can't get over her, and get engaged, although he alienates his family when he tells them that the child is not his and gets upset when Adrianna reveals her daughter is Ty's. Navid's family is very close knit and is in someways conservative. This is only applies to some areas of life, seeing that his dad runs an adult entertainment business.\n\nAnother featured character is [[Erin Silver (90210)|Erin Silver]] (who goes by her last name), [[Kelly Taylor (90210)|Kelly Taylor]] and [[Characters of Beverly Hills, 90210#David Silver|David Silver]]'s half sister and Naomi's former best friend, until Silver's father's affair is revealed by Naomi, although she eventually reconciles her friendship with Naomi. She quickly befriends Annie and starts dating Dixon, who is somewhat taken aback by her not-so-90210 lifestyle, as she is a virgin who doesn't care about popularity. In a multi-episode arc that culminated in a very special episode, it is revealed that Silver has [[bipolar disorder]]. Kelly Taylor is now a guidance counselor at West Beverly and has a son named Sammy. Kelly becomes Silver's guardian after their mother proves to be an inadequate caretaker for Silver due to her [[alcoholism]]. Kelly briefly dates Ryan, but discovers that he also slept with Brenda, re-creating the rift between the two friends. Following Brenda's discovery that she cannot have children, however, the women are drawn together in an accord once again.\n\nAt the prom, Adrianna goes into labor. She gives birth to a daughter whom she gives up for adoption. It is also revealed that Brenda has adopted a child from China. Ethan begins to realize his feelings for Silver, which leads to a confrontation with Dixon and a kiss with Silver. At Naomi and Jen's (her sister) after-prom party, Liam sleeps with Jen. He is mad that Naomi told Jen about his past: he wanted to keep it a secret. However, he was not aware that Jen was Naomi's sister, and upon finding out is horrified. Naomi finds out about it but thinks that Annie was with Liam, not Jen. This culminates in a major fight between Annie and Naomi where Annie is shunned by her peers, runs away, gets in her car drunk and accidentally [[Hit and run (vehicular)|runs over a man]]. This is a suspenseful way to end the season and definitely brings plot twist seeing that Annie is not sure whether or not this man survived.\n\n===Season 2 (2009\u201310)===\n{{Main|90210 (season 2)}}\n\n[[File:90210splogo.jpg|thumb|right|Intertitle used in the remaining seasons of the series]]\n\nSeason two begins with the end of [[summer school]]. Naomi unknowingly dates a married man in an attempt to get over Liam, who shows up at West Beverly on the first day of school after being absent for the entire summer. Silver and Dixon get back together, but break up when he finds out Silver kissed Ethan. It is also revealed that Ethan has decided to stay in Montana with his father. Adrianna is desperate to become a normal teenager, giving up acting, and, much to Navid's dismay, their relationship is put under further pressure with the arrival of [[Teddy Montgomery]], Adrianna's ex-boyfriend (to whom Adrianna lost her virginity). Meanwhile, the emotionally distant and guilt-ridden Annie has cut herself from society as much as possible, contributing to a growing discord between her and her brother, who is angry at her for sending him to summer school. Annie begins to date Jasper, which began as a guilt-ridden friendship but later turned into a relationship. Jasper is different from any other boy Annie has dated. He is more quiet and mysterious compared to her past boyfriends. Dixon meets a girl named Sasha when he begins his DJing career and is performing near her in a yacht, to whom he lies about his real age. Navid and Adrianna's relationship continues to tremble when Adrianna continues to find Teddy alluring. In the meantime, Harry and Debbie face marital problems when Harry confides to Kelly about his family troubles. Naomi finds out that her SAT scores are not high enough to get into California University, so she decides to date the Dean of Admission's son, Richard. She later falls for Richard's roommate, Jamie. Sasha finally learns about Dixon's real age when Debbie accidentally shows Sasha, whom she met by chance in a salon and does not know, a picture of her son Dixon who is only in high school.\n\nSilver accompanies Adrianna to an [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meeting where she sees her mother, Jackie. Silver learns that Jackie has breast [[cancer]]. Kelly forbids Silver to see their mother to try to relieve the pain, but Silver moves in with her mother to take care of her. Adrianna breaks up with Navid to get back with Teddy, but learns that Teddy does not want a relationship, which makes Adrianna feel sorry for the mistake she has made. Jen continues to manipulate both Naomi and Ryan by manipulating Naomi into lending her a large amount of money, and by persuading Ryan that Liam is hitting on her. Silver, being paired up with Teddy, learns that Teddy's mother died, which causes a friendship to blossom. Liam meets [[Ivy Sullivan|Ivy]], a surfer whom he butts heads with. They form a friendship, which is later made complicated by Ivy having feelings for Liam, feelings which Liam rebuffs. Navid and Gia launch an investigation, believing that Jasper is a drug dealer. Being upset about her break-up with Navid, Adrianna [[relapse]]s on drugs. Sasha tells Dixon she is pregnant, about which Debbie and Harry think she is lying. Debbie, Dixon's mom, meets Sasha and she finds out that Sasha is not really pregnant, and advises her to stay away from her son. Jackie and Teddy give Silver her half-birthday by recreating the previous half-birthdays that Jackie couldn't attend because of her alcoholism. Later, Jackie is hospitalized, during which time Kelly and Jackie reconcile before Jackie dies. Navid witnesses Adrianna buying drugs from Jasper which causes him to confront them. Liam finally confides to Dixon, Teddy and Ivy about the events on prom night as they try to figure out a way to get revenge on Jen. Their attempt to get revenge on Jen works, which makes Jen lose everything she has including her sister and boyfriend Ryan. Teddy begins to pursue Silver more and they share a kiss on the rooftop of the school. Teddy asks Silver out to the dance, but she declines. Navid is hospitalized when Jasper pushes him down the stairs at school because he finds out that Navid is telling people that he is a drug dealer. Navid remembers that it was Jasper who pushed him down the stairs and is determined to let Annie know he is a drug dealer. Navid asks Adrianna to admit to Annie that she bought drugs from Jasper. After Dixon realizes that Jen is the one who slept with Liam and not Annie, he opts to help Annie. Naomi also feels bad for Annie when she learns the truth about prom night. At the dance, Teddy and Silver share a kiss. Silver storms off but later admits to Naomi that she felt something when they kissed. Just as Silver is about to tell Teddy that she wants to give it a shot, she sees him hugging a girl, not knowing it is Teddy's sister. Dixon reveals to Silver that he still has feelings for her, after which he lies and says that he did not know who the girl was that Teddy was embracing. Naomi, Navid, Dixon, and Silver reveal to Annie the truth about Jasper with the help of Adrianna. Annie confronts Jasper about his lies and he reveals to her that he knows she was the one who [[Vehicular homicide|killed his uncle]].\n\nAfter Christmas break, Jasper blackmails Annie into staying with him. Annie finally decides to end it with Jasper, who then tries to commit [[suicide]] by jumping off of the [[Hollywood Sign]]. In the hospital, he tells Annie that he will keep her secret about the hit-and-run. Adrianna reaches out to fellow Alcoholics Anonymous member Gia for help with staying sober. To make Gia's ex-girlfriend jealous, Adrianna kisses her. Adrianna and Gia become good friends, and when Gia reveals her feelings for Adrianna, they become a couple, but break up after Gia cheats on Adrianna with her ex-girlfriend. Adrianna is approached by Laurel (Ivy's mother) about a recording contract, and she accepts. Navid decides that he wants to win Adrianna back, while Dixon and Ivy explore a relationship with each other. Dixon gets caught up in gambling, getting him into trouble at school with some boys he owes money to. Dixon's issue with gambling is a true addiction to the point where he begins borrowing money from his friends and losing it all. Silver and Teddy begin a relationship, and continue despite his father offering her money to break up with Teddy. Teddy is a huge tennis player and has a bright future of that in front of him and his dad does not want any girls getting in the way.\n\nNaomi and Liam start their relationship fresh. Naomi admits to Liam that she has been feigning interest in things he likes and that she needs to be true to herself, even if it means their relationship won't work. This is what Liam wants, and their relationship becomes more stable; however, when Naomi is forced to come clean over false rumors she spread claiming that she was [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] by a teacher, Mr. Cannon, Liam decides that he needs a break from her. During this time, Annie and Liam become closer and he consoles her after she overhears her mother, Debbie, confessing to her father, Harry, that she kissed her yoga instructor. His consolation causes Annie to believe that Liam is flirting with her, but realizing that this was not his intent, Annie instead advises Liam to stay with Naomi, as she does not want to ruin her friendship again over a boy. Liam begins to have his own troubles when his father returns, pretending that he wants to have a relationship with his son. But when Liam steals very valuable coins from his stepfather in hopes of starting a life with his father, he abandons Liam. Naomi becomes distracted by her pregnant sister Jen returning to town and causing trouble for Naomi. Naomi finds out that Ryan is the father of Jen's baby, and informs him of his impending fatherhood. Jen does not want Ryan to have anything to do with the future of their baby, but Ryan is insistent that he should be involved. After Liam breaks up with her, a devastated Naomi is [[rape]]d by Mr. Cannon, who tells her that after her initial false accusations, nobody will believe her. Mr. Cannon and Naomi had been working on a digital media project when they had become close and worked after hours on a project. This is also when Naomi was attacked by Mr. Cannon. Dixon leaves for Australia with Ivy after witnessing his parents having another argument. Harry informs Debbie that he was fired as principal of West Beverly after covering up an incident at school for Dixon. Annie reveals to Liam about the hit-and-run, and he encourages her to confess. Jasper is jealous that Annie and Liam are spending so much time together and sets [[arson|fire]] to Liam's boat that he has been working on for a very long time. Liam sees this and attacks Jasper as the police arrive.\n\n===Season 3 (2010\u201311)===\n{{Main|90210 (season 3)}}\n\nSeason three begins with Beverly Hills being shaken up by an earthquake as the main characters start out their senior year. Naomi spent the summer isolating herself, assuring her friends' visits by promising money from her trust fund. She decides to report her rape by Mr. Cannon, but backs out after discovering that her case will be made more difficult by her previous false accusations. Later, her sister Jen overhears Naomi and Silver's conversation and decides to take matters into her own hands with the help of Ryan, who had seen Cannon and Naomi in the school while he was there drunk. When Naomi finds enough proof to press charges, Cannon disappears. Cannon was from the UK, and had actually been accused many times of rape prior to attacking Naomi. Later, Jen feels that she is a bad mother, and leaves her son in the hands of Ryan.\n\nMeanwhile, Annie and Dixon are going through rough times after their parents' [[divorce]] and attempt to keep the family close. Debbie deals with the realities of being a newly single mother. Annie has spent the summer on [[house arrest]] (in addition to being on [[probation]] and having a suspended license) after confessing to her hit-and-run. Annie and Liam have feelings for each other but think it best to put it away so it doesn't interfere with their relationships with others. Annie finds romance with a college student, Charlie, who turns out to be Liam's half-brother. Charlie and Annie have a lot in common and both are theater kids. Liam has a tumultuous relationship with Charlie due to their rocky past. Teddy and Silver are happy to be together, but in the earthquake Teddy injures his leg, which could possibly end his tennis career. Teddy is also struggling with his [[homosexuality|sexuality]], after realizing that he drunkenly slept with another guy, Ian. After some discouraging behavior from Teddy, Silver breaks up with him. This discouraging behavior was a result of Teddy being so insecure with himself being gay. With all that going on in school, Adrianna is driving back from a summer of touring with the pop star, Javier. The two become a couple until Navid reveals to Adrianna that he has never stopped loving her, and she dumps Javier for Navid. Although he initially resolves to get her back, Javier becomes angered by this. He tells her that her singing career is over, before dying in a car crash, which Adrianna survives. She steals Javier's song book and performs one of his songs at his memorial service, which becomes a hit. She is then blackmailed by Javier's uncle, Victor, who becomes her manager and takes a huge portion of her earnings and forces her to do some things she finds uncomfortable, such as taking half naked photos and forming a snobby famous image that did not exist before. Navid, realizing the blackmail, asks Adrianna not to give in to the threats of Victor. Adrianna decides to take control of her career from Victor after seeing herself on the cover of a magazine. She begins to treat Victor badly and starts alienating Navid and her friends. Navid, however, begins to have family problems when he and Silver discover that his father has been employing underage girls to be in his porn films. Adrianna is oblivious to his problems, causing him and Silver to become closer.\n\nContinuing with relationships, Ivy is still with Dixon but returns from Australia with her old childhood friend, Oscar, who seems to make Dixon uncomfortable. Oscar has hidden motives for revenge on Laurel, Ivy's mother, who he believes is responsible for his mother's suicide. He and Laurel have been sleeping together secretly throughout the summer, and the next step of his plan is to sleep with Ivy as well. When he succeeds, taking her virginity, both of them find out, leaving Ivy upset with her mother. Dixon breaks up with Ivy out of fear after finding out from his ex-girlfriend Sasha that he may be [[HIV]] positive, though he later tests negative (Oscar had bribed Sasha to tell Dixon this in order to make him leave Ivy so that he could make a move). Dixon and Ivy get back together, but Dixon then finds out that Oscar took Ivy's virginity on the night she and Dixon had argued and the two break up again. Naomi starts to fall for Oscar, even though Ivy has warned her of his actions. When he offers to be her boyfriend, she declines. However, unluckily for Naomi, Mr. Cannon is waiting for her in her hotel room when she returns from Adrianna's Christmas party. Mr. Cannon holds Naomi hostage and invites Silver to come over. Once she arrives, Mr. Cannon ties her up as well and tells the girls of his plan to prove his innocence and go to the bank to drain Naomi's trust fund. Silver and Naomi gang up and attack Mr. Cannon. Naomi wants to slit his throat but Silver talks her out of it and calls the police.\n\nLiam reconciles with Charlie after a heart-to-heart conversation in which they discuss the [[physical abuse]] they endured as children. After Charlie discovers that Annie has true feelings for Liam, he leaves to study abroad in France, leaving Annie and Liam to start a relationship. Annie begins to have other troubles, however, when her cousin Emily visits from Kansas. Emily starts to take over things in Annie's life; her friends, her acting roles, her internship, and her relationship with Liam. Annie and Liam find a way to prove Emily's scheming ways to everyone, running her out of town. Teddy has continued to struggle with his homosexuality and his feelings for Ian. After being blackmailed anonymously, and with encouragement from Ian, he decides to [[coming out|come out]] to his friends. He later discovers that Ian was the one who blackmailed him, and breaks up with him. After a serious accident during surf practice, Ivy is prescribed [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] to help relieve [[anxiety]], and meets Raj. Raj reveals to Ivy that he has cancer and they start a close friendship that blossoms into a relationship after he helps her recover from her fear of getting back into the water. Adrianna's secret about stealing Javier's song book is revealed by Victor, which damages her burgeoning career. Navid and Silver have developed a secret relationship. Navid breaks up with Adrianna due to her new self-centered behavior, after which Adrianna discovers that Navid had been cheating on her with Silver. During a retreat, Naomi meets Guru Sona, whom she believes to have good intentions, but later realizes that she scammed her out of a large sum of money. A nerdy guy, Max, helps her get her money back, after which Naomi develops feelings for him. Naomi and Max begin secretly dating to protect their respective reputations, but after the pressure to keep things a secret become too much for Naomi, they decide to out their relationship. A newly vindictive Adrianna decides to exact revenge on Silver for her betrayal. After continuing to feud with each other, Silver and Adrianna call a truce and resolve their friendship. Later though, Adrianna deceives Silver and switches her bipolar medication with placebos, causing Silver to spin out of control. After noticing Silver's strange behavior, Navid and Dixon intervene and have Silver committed to a mental hospital.\n\nAnnie begins working as a personal assistant to an aging actress, Marla Templeton. Annie begins to worry about Marla's well being after she starts to show signs of [[dementia]] and finds pamphlets on [[assisted suicide]]. She convinces Marla to attend a re-release of one of her films, which seems to reinvigorate Marla. However, when Annie arrives at Marla's home the next day, she discovers that she has committed suicide. Still reeling from his break-up with Ian, Teddy meets a new guy, Marco. He and Marco eventually begin dating. Jen returns to California and tells Ryan that she wants another chance at raising their son, which they eventually agree upon. While Silver is in the hospital, Adrianna takes the opportunity to get close to Navid by getting him drunk and telling him that they kissed. When Navid continues to reject her, Adrianna tells Silver that Navid kissed her, effectively breaking them up. Raj's health worsens, making him and Ivy concerned for his life. Ivy and Raj decide to get married. During the bachelor/bachelorette party, Silver's stolen medication falls out of Adrianna's purse. After being shunned by her friends and considering suicide, Adrianna resolves to become a better person. Max cheats on a paper for Naomi, and when they are caught, Naomi takes the blame. During graduation, Max confesses that it was he who cheated, thus allowing Naomi to graduate. After Marla's death, Annie is informed that she has inherited Marla's entire estate. Liam decides not to attend college and takes a job on a fishing boat during the summer. Annie is very sad about this. Max is told that he must stay away from Naomi by his parents, but she later reveals to him that she is pregnant.\n\n===Season 4 (2011\u201312)===\n{{Main|90210 (season 4)}}\n\nSeason four begins with Naomi breaking up with Max after what she feels is his excessive relief on discovering that her pregnancy was a false positive.\n\nAt the end of the summer, the various kids are preparing to move on with their lives. Liam comes back from his job on the fishing boat and asks Annie twice to marry him; she says no both times. Liam drunkenly buys a beach bar and starts to develop feelings for a widow he met over the summer. Silver and Navid are living together as Navid manages his business, but are forced to take in his rebellious teenage sister, Leila ([[Summer Bishil]]), when she refuses to go to boarding school. His life is complicated by Leila's rebellious nature and by the discovery that his uncle has been running a stolen car ring out of Shirazi Studios. Not only is this tough on Navid, but also on Silver who is doing most of the babysitting of Leila. Ivy finds herself dealing with the emotional toll from Raj's deteriorating health. Naomi, attempting to make a big impression at CU buys a large house, coming into conflict with the owner's son Austin ([[Justin Deeley]]), who had been growing marijuana on the property. Austin is a very rich, down-to-earth country man. He is very different than Naomi's ex-boyfriend Max, who was the complete opposite. Naomi throws a big elaborate beginning of school party for CU students, but this backfires when the party is raided by the police and Naomi disposes of Austin's marijuana plants by tossing them on a bonfire, causing CU's star quarterback to later test positive for drug use. The disastrous party causes Naomi to enter CU as the most unpopular girl in school, a situation she attempts to rectify by pledging a popular sorority. Initially, things appear to be going well as Naomi is taken under the wing of the sorority President, Holly ([[Megalyn Echikunwoke]]). But after performing a series of humiliating hazing rituals, Naomi discovers that Holly never intended to let her into the sorority and that this was all done to humiliate Naomi. Vowing revenge, Naomi buys her way into the only sorority that will have her: one made up of nerds and social rejects, and becomes their president. Naomi has sex with Austin after he agrees to help her new sorority humiliate Holly. However, she later learns that Austin was using her to break up with Holly, whom he had been dating. When Holly invites Max to a campus event to unsettle Naomi, she rekindles her romance with him, but still finds herself attracted to Austin.

Sachs found that Walter knew pieces of scenes, and suggested \"stuff that works\".<ref name=\"allcasting\" /> Sachs described [[Ryan Eggold]], who portrayed Matthews, as \"a sophisticated actor, and he's also very funny\". Sachs believed that every time Eggold would be on screen, \"people are going to go, 'Wow!'\".<ref name=\"allcasting\" /> The producers were looking for an actor who could portray Silver as a \"quirky kid who moves to her own beat\". Sachs explained that [[Jessica Stroup]] \"came in dressed for the part, artsy and quirky, and she had her hair up and she had a bandanna. She nailed it.\"<ref name=\"allcasting\" /> The producers were fans of [[Tristan Wilds]] for his acting on ''[[The Wire]]'', and hoped to hire him as Dixon from the start of casting.

The ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' creator, [[Darren Star]], was announced not to be involved with the project. The only surviving element from the original series was believed to be [[Creative Artists Agency]], the talent agency which conceived the spin-off idea. ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' creator [[Rob Thomas (writer)|Rob Thomas]] was in negotiations to write the pilot and [[Mark Piznarski]] was in talks to direct it.\n\n===Development===\nA detailed breakdown of the pilot written by Thomas was released on March 17, 2008, containing information on the plot and characters which would be in the series. None of the characters were related to the original series of ''90210'' which again aired a few years before except Erin Silver played by Jessica Stroup; however, the new series' featured a similar premise: a family with two teenagers who recently moved from the Midwest to Beverly Hills. To reflect the situation at the Beverly Hills school, where around 40 percent of the students were of Persian descent, a student named Navid Shirazi was created. Thomas intended to introduce The Peach Pit, the diner from ''Beverly Hills, 90210'', but noted that it would not be featured in the pilot. The writer considered giving the siblings a job at a movie theater, as he did not want them to use their parents' credit cards. Thomas revealed that there were plans to reintroduce one of the original cast members, but had not met with any of them to discuss a role. Thomas later elaborated the producers wanted to see \"as many of the original cast members as possible\", but were careful not to \"parade them all out in the pilot\".\n\nOn April 14, 2008, Thomas announced that he was sidelining the series to focus on his two pilots for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah were hired as the new executive producers and wrote a new version of the script in late April. Sachs said that although Thomas had a \"great script\", their version of the script was edgier. Judah said that they were trying to ground their script in reality, with real character stories and emotional stories. The writers wanted the audience to relate to the characters' problems, which they wanted to be truthful and emotional, but also comedic. The pair were interested in telling several stories simultaneously, featuring many characters.<ref name=\"sachsinter\" /> The pair changed the surname of the main family from Mills to Wilson, along with changing the name of the mother from Celia to Debbie. The pair also told reporters that they would be adding their \"comedic impulses\" to the script.<ref name=\"tvguidepilot\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/Fall-TV-Press-12658.aspx|title=Fall TV Press Tour: More ''90210'' Deets|accessdate=January 28, 2009|date=July 19, 2008|work=[[TV Guide (magazine)|TV Guide]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202094948/http://www.tvguide.com/news/Fall-TV-Press-12658.aspx| archivedate=February 2, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Sachs and Judah found the parents to be an important part of the series, and designed to be contemporary parents.<ref name=\"sachsinter\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/arts/television/31sach.html?pagewanted=print|title=Gabe Sachs, executive producer, ''90210''|accessdate=January 28, 2009|author=Itzkoff, Dave|date=August 31, 2008|work=The New York Times| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095712/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/arts/television/31sach.html?pagewanted=print| archivedate=October 6, 2014| url-status= live}}</ref> Since the producers were both fathers, they designed the script to include more prominent adult story lines and a strong point of view on parenting.

The characters were a hit. After disagreeing with the network executives over the series' storylines, Sachs and Judah ended their tenure as producers. The CW wanted the series to have a female perspective and focus more on teenage life and glamour; however, Judah and Sachs were more comfortable writing for men, featuring family stories. The studio brought in [[Rebecca Rand Kirshner Sinclair]], co-executive producer of the popular show ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', to revamp the failing ''90210''.

His flowing architecture marked with smooth curvilinear forms is influenced by his [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] heritage as well as European [[Expressionist architecture]].<ref name=\"CE\">[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/douglas-joseph-cardinal/ Douglas Cardinal], The Canadian Encyclopedia</ref> His passion for unconventional forms and appreciation of nature and landscape were present in his life from a very young age, and consequently developed into the unique architectural style he has employed throughout his career. Cardinal is perhaps best known for his designs of the [[Canadian Museum of History]] in [[Gatineau, Quebec]] (1989) and the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1998).<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=39}}</ref> He is considered one of the most influential Aboriginal architects, having shaped and preserved indigenous architecture and culture in modern history.\n\n==Life==\nBorn in [[Calgary, Alberta]] to parents Joseph and Frances Cardinal, Douglas Cardinal is the eldest of eight children. His father was of [[Blackfoot]]/Kainai and Algonquin heritage, and his mother was of German and [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] descent.<ref name=\"CE\"/> His mother worked as a nurse and was very well educated. Cardinal's parents met in 1926, and in the first half of the 20th century women had very little status and rights. The patriarchal society did not recognize educated women like Frances Cardinal. However, his father's tribe's societal norms accepted a matrilineal culture, where women are very respected and admired.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2018|title=Douglas Cardinal|url=|journal=The Canadian Architect|volume= 63, Iss. 2|pages=30\u201332|via=}}</ref> These cultural ideas shaped Cardinal's upbringing and affected his worldview and relationship with his heritage. He has recalled that his mother told him at a young age, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be an architect.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nCardinal grew up in a small city in [[Red Deer, Alberta]]. He was sent to St. Joseph's Convent Catholic [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Residential School]] and spent the remainder of his high school years in Red Deer. [[Grey Nuns]] taught him about arts and culture, and he has said that his religious school influenced him immensely. Living away from the rest of his family made him focus on his academic achievements. Traditional sacred architecture and its role in culture made him want to create spaces as powerful and inspirational as churches and basilicas. It also ignited in him a passion for architecture in those early years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, he started studying architecture at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) but was forced to leave two years later due to his radical ideas. His different approach toward architecture did not align with the ideas of [[Modernism (architecture)|modernism]] at the time. He wanted to create buildings responding to nature and the organic rhythm of life, which was unprecedented in the 1950s.<ref name=\":1\" /> In his third year of studies, he was told by the director of UBC that he had \"a wrong background\" for the program and the profession. After he left Vancouver and returned to Red Deer to start working at local architectural firms as a draftsman. His ejection from UBC made it impossible for him to apply to Canadian universities again. Cardinal himself also wanted a change of scenery due to racism towards Indigenous people in his home country so decided to head south, quickly stopping in Arizona and Mexico, and later settling in Texas.<ref name=\":1\" /> Eventually, he attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], from which he graduated with a degree in Architecture in 1963.\n\nIn university, he also studied [[cultural anthropology]], due to his cultural heritage and philosophy based on the sacredness of life and nature. He wanted to study people and did not feel that the buildings around him were designed around people. His philosophy also intertwines with the philosophy of another famous architect, [[Rudolf Steiner|Rudolph Steiner]], whom Douglas studied at University of Texas. Steiner's work inspired Douglas to study [[anthropomorphism]], which he applied to his work as well.<ref name=\":0\" /> The idea of anthropomorphism and its concept of responding to the human behavior, natural cycle of life and beauty of sacred land and tectonics aligned with Cardinal's philosophy and his cultural heritage. Another great inspiration for Cardinal were works of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. He appreciated his organic way of responding to the landscape with the use of natural materials, such as stone and brick.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=17}}</ref> In Texas, he accepted his Indigenous heritage and one of his professors even encouraged him to learn more about his background.\n\n==Career==\nCardinal opened his private practice in 1964, and the same year he was commissioned to design St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta.<ref>https://www.stmarysparishreddeer.com/parish/history/</ref> Construction was completed in 1968, and it has since been recognized as a prominent example in the history of Canadian architecture. In 2007, the church was featured on a [[Canada Post]] stamp series featuring four Canadian architects to commemorate the centennial of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] (RAIC).<ref>https://postagestampguide.com/stamps/17713/st-mary-s-church-2007-canada-postage-stamp-royal-architectural-institute-of-canada-100-years</ref>\n\nBeginning with his work on St. Mary's, Cardinal was one of the first North American architects to use computers to assist in the design process. His curvilinear designs reflect the landscape around them, so that people making use of the building can retain a sense of the surrounding land. He found that the use of computerized design would fit best for his unusual designs and the use of shapes. He also found 3D programs very useful for laying out the exact dimensions of buildings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=44}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he was hired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] as the Primary Design Architect for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] (NMAI). The NMAI is currently situated on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and is directly across from the [[United States Capitol|Capitol of the United States of America]]. After contractual disputes, Cardinal was removed from the project in 1998 before it was completed, but he continued to provide input into the building's design.\n\nIn 2008, his firm was hired by the Kirkland Foundation to design a museum/convention center in Union City, Tenn.  The [[Discovery Park of America]] was to be a unique structure housing a multi level museum with artifacts from across the nation as well as provide a place for large conventions/meetings for the community.  Early in 2009 the firm's contract was terminated with the owner, and all construction activity was halted, due to undisclosed differences between the two parties.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Douglas Cardinal.jpg|thumb|193x193px|Douglas Cardinal in 1970s]] -->\n\n=== Architectural Style and Philosophy ===\nThroughout his early years, Douglas Cardinal was dealing with racism and societal ideas of conformity for both his lifestyle and architecture. Only in his years in Texas he started to fully embrace his indigenous heritage and learn more about it.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=26}}</ref> In 1970s Cardinal developed his trademark architectural style with organic curvilinear forms. In those years he started wearing native clothes and necklaces, as well as becoming an advocate for indigenous rights.<ref name=\":2\" /> This spiritual connection with his native culture affected and influenced his work and unique architectural approach. Many philosophical ideas of indigenous history include its respect and sensibility towards nature, humans' inseparable relationship with the environment and land. These concepts resulted in his use of natural materials, organic shapes, soil and sun studies, as well as creating spaces that move people spiritually and make them appreciative of their surroundings. The native philosophy is also very contrasting from the Western civilization worldview due to its use of time. It is appreciative of resilience of nature and its ability to withstand hard conditions. Therefore, its architecture aims to last for seven generations, as opposed to the economically driven and efficient approach of the patriachial society.<ref name=\":0\" />\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:St. Mary's Church, Red Deer, Alberta.jpg|left|thumb|Cardinal's first building - St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta]] -->\n\n=== St. Mary's Church ===\nSt. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta is Cardinal's first building. Upon his return to Alberta, Cardinal met with Father Werner Merx, who wanted the new church be innovative and unique. The archbishop of the church has already appointed another architect for the job, but Merx insisted on hiring Cardinal and realizing his vision. The archbishop whom they needed to convince turned out to be Anthony Jordan, who helped to resolve legal case for Cardinal 10 years earlier. Douglas Cardinal was approved for a job.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=22}}</ref>\n\nThe church has 750 seats inside and includes tubular skylights for natural daylight. Cardinal started his first project in 1967 and it turned out to be so challenging that he doubted if he could survive its completion. However, the building became one of his iconic designs that determined his architectural style. He combined all of his philosophical and cultural ideas and created a church that represented his many beliefs towards the nature and organic forms, that is unique and unprecedented for its time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=24}}</ref>\n\n=== Canadian Museum of History ===\n[[File:Gatineau - QC - Museum of Civilisation2.jpg|thumb|Canadian Museum of History|alt=]]This building, opened in 1989 as Canadian Museum of Civilization at the time, is another project that is very representative of Cardinal's architectural style. Influenced by his indigenous heritage it focuses on the response to its surroundings. It is located on the banks of the Ottawa River, facing [[Parliament Hill]]. All the massive government buildings in the city center are clustered and turned away from the river. Cardinal opened the Great Hall towards the river, making it the only building in the area that is responding to it. This approach also translated into the wrapping facade with curves that can embrace and invite people inside and create welcoming environment.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=28}}</ref> The envelope of the building is shaped in an organic form, as if sculptured by the forces of nature. He also wanted to acknowledge his appreciation for the Parliament by using the same limestone as the one used in the building. Besides responding to the site conditions, the museum also engages with its historic context by including totem poles and native murals inside the building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=29}}</ref> He wanted the space inside feel alive and dynamic, and not limit its form to the programmatic requirements.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=34}}</ref> Former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau also encouraged Cardinal to create a museum where people embrace their different backgrounds and learn from each other. Prime minister's idea for multicultural Canadian society aligned well with Cardinal's vision.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=31}}</ref> The overall concept and purpose of the building corresponded with his ideas. However, in 1984 new government was not approving of Cardinal's design. He then lost his team on the project and was not fully paid for his previous work. This was a tremendous loss for the architect, but he was too driven to fulfill this project and was not willing to give up. After long years of defending his design, he eventually finished the museum and it became on of his many fundamental projects.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n=== The Group of Seven ===\nIn 20th century, there were several artistic hierarchies, such as [[Group of Seven (artists)|Canadian Group of Seven]]. Cardinal was part of a similar group that included some of Canada's most influential architects, such as [[Moshe Safdie]], [[Raymond Moriyama]], [[Eberhard Zeidler]], [[Arthur Erickson]], [[Ray Affleck]] and Ron Thom. This environment was encouraging for the architect and they often shared ideas and passion to create great architecture.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=36}}</ref> Although all of their styles and conceptual vision were different, they all agreed on creating with meaning and beauty, instead of commercial skyscrapers of that era. However, his personal and financial problems often made him lose his direction and consequently he did not receive as much recognition as his peers.<ref name=\":3\" /> These instances include his design of the Grand Prairie Regional College in Alberta. Opened in 1974, this project did not meet government's simplistic and modernistic vision for the project and went over budget.\n\n==Works==\nAmong the many projects Cardinal has completed in his career are the following:<ref name=Doyle>{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Richard I.|title=Renaissance II: Canadian creativity and innovation in the new millennium|year=2001|publisher=Intercept Ltd|isbn=978-0-660-18397-8|pages=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WrhJnmXdBIC&pg=PA38&dq=Douglas+Cardinal#v=onepage&q=Douglas%20Cardinal&f=false}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nSpruce Grove City Hall.jpg|Spruce Grove City Hall (1981) in [[Spruce Grove]], [[Alberta]]\nSpace-and-Science-Centre-Edmonton-Alberta.jpg|[[Edmonton Space and Science Centre|Edmonton Space And Science Centre]] (1984) Coronation Park, [[Edmonton, Alberta]], which has since been renovated and rebranded as the [[Telus World of Science]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\nGatineau - QC - Museum of Civilisation3.jpg|[[Canadian Museum of History]] (1989) in [[Gatineau, Quebec]], opposite [[Parliament Hill]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\nYork Region Administrative Centre 02.jpg|[[York Regional Council#York Region Administrative Centre|York Region Administrative Centre]] (1992) in [[Newmarket, Ontario]]\nNational Museum of the American Indian.JPG|[[Smithsonian]] [[National Museum of the American Indian]] (1993\u20131998) [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>\nOuj\u00e9-Bougoumou.jpg|Cultural Institute (1996) [[Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou, Qu\u00e9bec]]\nFirst Nations University 4.jpg|[[First Nations University of Canada|First Nations University]] (2003) in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]\nGordon Oakes Red Bear Centre.jpg|Gordon Oakes Red Bear Centre (2016) at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]\n</gallery>\n* St. Mary's Church (1968) [[Red Deer, Alberta]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\n* St. Albert Place & City Hall (1976) [[St. Albert, Alberta]]\n* Alberta Government Services (Provincial) Building (1976) [[Ponoka, Alberta]]\n* [[Grande Prairie Regional College]] (1976) [[Grande Prairie]], [[Alberta]]\n* Leighton Artist Colony, at the Banff Centre (1985) [[Banff, Alberta]]\n*Wabano Centre (2013) [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Grotski Residence (1978) [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]]\n*Bonneville Rehabilitation Centre [[Bonnyville|Bonnyville, Alberta]]\n*Ojigkwanong Students Centre, Carleton University, [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Ile a la Crosse Elementary School [[\u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse|\u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan]]\n*Cardinal Studio [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]]\n*Ouje' Bougoumou Village, [[Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou|Ouje' Bougoumou, Quebec]]\n*Janvier Gallery [[Cold Lake, Alberta]]\n*Grand Traverse Civic Centre Ottawa, Ontario\n*Circle of Life Thunderbird Place (2001) [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]]\n*Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall (1991) [[Gatineau|Gatineau, Quebec]]\n*Kanai Middle School (1996) Sioux Valley, Manitoba\n*Iskotew Healing Lodge [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Sioux Valley (1986) Sioux Valley, Manitoba\n*Cardinal Residence (1982) [[Stony Plain, Alberta]]\n*Fairview Elementary School (1975) [[Red Deer, Alberta]]\n*Precam Elementary School (1976) La Ronge, Edmonton\n*Long Point First Nation, [[Winneway|Winneway,\u00a0Quebec]]\n*Me-No-Ya Win Health Centre (2010) [[Sioux Lookout|Sioux lookout, Ontario]]\n*Adelante Healthcare Goodyear Project (2018) [[Mesa, Arizona]]\n*Gordon Oakes Redbear Students Centre (2016) [[Saskatoon|Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]]\n*Unceded: Voices of the Land Exhibition (2018) [[Venice Biennale]]\n\n== Achievements ==\n\n=== Writings ===\n\n* ''Of the Spirit,'' NeWest Press (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada), 1977.<ref name=\":4\">Douglas Joseph Cardinal.

Her Irish Catholic family did not accept of their relationship because of his heritage and the two of them eloped. This also was a problem, because Cardinal had charges pressed against him as an interracial marriage was illegal at the time. He was defended by the archbishop lawyer Anthony Jordan and was not found guilty. Deirdre then was pressured to move back with her family, and was raising their first daughter alone.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nShortly before he decided to go the Unites States, he started a relationship with Carole Olson. She accompanied him on a road trip 1957 to Texas and they later got married. They had three children - Nancy, Guy and Bret. The couple split during their years in America due to his preoccupation with work.<ref name=\":7\" /> His son Bret is also an architect and has worked with his father for 25 years until he started his own architecture firm.\n\nHe married Marylin Zahar in 1973, with whom he had two children - Lisa and Jean-Marc.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHis current wife Idoia Arana-Beobide is also of Basque indigenous heritage.

His flowing architecture marked with smooth curvilinear forms is influenced by his [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] heritage as well as European [[Expressionist architecture]].<ref name=\"CE\">[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/douglas-joseph-cardinal/ Douglas Cardinal], The Canadian Encyclopedia</ref> His passion for unconventional forms and appreciation of nature and landscape were present in his life from a very young age, and consequently developed into the unique architectural style he has employed throughout his career. Cardinal is perhaps best known for his designs of the [[Canadian Museum of History]] in [[Gatineau, Quebec]] (1989) and the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1998).<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=39}}</ref> He is considered one of the most influential Aboriginal architects, having shaped and preserved indigenous architecture and culture in modern history.\n\n==Life==\nBorn in [[Calgary, Alberta]] to parents Joseph and Frances Cardinal, Douglas Cardinal is the eldest of eight children. His father was of [[Blackfoot]]/Kainai and Algonquin heritage, and his mother was of German and [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] descent.<ref name=\"CE\"/> His mother worked as a nurse and was very well educated. Cardinal's parents met in 1926, and in the first half of the 20th century women had very little status and rights. The patriarchal society did not recognize educated women like Frances Cardinal. However, his father's tribe's societal norms accepted a matrilineal culture, where women are very respected and admired.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2018|title=Douglas Cardinal|url=|journal=The Canadian Architect|volume= 63, Iss. 2|pages=30\u201332|via=}}</ref> These cultural ideas shaped Cardinal's upbringing and affected his worldview and relationship with his heritage. He has recalled that his mother told him at a young age, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be an architect.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nCardinal grew up in a small city in [[Red Deer, Alberta]]. He was sent to St. Joseph's Convent Catholic [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Residential School]] and spent the remainder of his high school years in Red Deer. [[Grey Nuns]] taught him about arts and culture, and he has said that his religious school influenced him immensely. Living away from the rest of his family made him focus on his academic achievements. Traditional sacred architecture and its role in culture made him want to create spaces as powerful and inspirational as churches and basilicas. It also ignited in him a passion for architecture in those early years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, he started studying architecture at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) but was forced to leave two years later due to his radical ideas. His different approach toward architecture did not align with the ideas of [[Modernism (architecture)|modernism]] at the time. He wanted to create buildings responding to nature and the organic rhythm of life, which was unprecedented in the 1950s.<ref name=\":1\" /> In his third year of studies, he was told by the director of UBC that he had \"a wrong background\" for the program and the profession. After he left Vancouver and returned to Red Deer to start working at local architectural firms as a draftsman. His ejection from UBC made it impossible for him to apply to Canadian universities again. Cardinal himself also wanted a change of scenery due to racism towards Indigenous people in his home country so decided to head south, quickly stopping in Arizona and Mexico, and later settling in Texas.<ref name=\":1\" /> Eventually, he attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], from which he graduated with a degree in Architecture in 1963.\n\nIn university, he also studied [[cultural anthropology]], due to his cultural heritage and philosophy based on the sacredness of life and nature. He wanted to study people and did not feel that the buildings around him were designed around people. His philosophy also intertwines with the philosophy of another famous architect, [[Rudolf Steiner|Rudolph Steiner]], whom Douglas studied at University of Texas. Steiner's work inspired Douglas to study [[anthropomorphism]], which he applied to his work as well.<ref name=\":0\" /> The idea of anthropomorphism and its concept of responding to the human behavior, natural cycle of life and beauty of sacred land and tectonics aligned with Cardinal's philosophy and his cultural heritage. Another great inspiration for Cardinal were works of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. He appreciated his organic way of responding to the landscape with the use of natural materials, such as stone and brick.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=17}}</ref> In Texas, he accepted his Indigenous heritage and one of his professors even encouraged him to learn more about his background.\n\n==Career==\nCardinal opened his private practice in 1964, and the same year he was commissioned to design St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta.<ref>https://www.stmarysparishreddeer.com/parish/history/</ref> Construction was completed in 1968, and it has since been recognized as a prominent example in the history of Canadian architecture. In 2007, the church was featured on a [[Canada Post]] stamp series featuring four Canadian architects to commemorate the centennial of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] (RAIC).<ref>https://postagestampguide.com/stamps/17713/st-mary-s-church-2007-canada-postage-stamp-royal-architectural-institute-of-canada-100-years</ref>\n\nBeginning with his work on St. Mary's, Cardinal was one of the first North American architects to use computers to assist in the design process. His curvilinear designs reflect the landscape around them, so that people making use of the building can retain a sense of the surrounding land. He found that the use of computerized design would fit best for his unusual designs and the use of shapes. He also found 3D programs very useful for laying out the exact dimensions of buildings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=44}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he was hired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] as the Primary Design Architect for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] (NMAI). The NMAI is currently situated on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and is directly across from the [[United States Capitol|Capitol of the United States of America]]. After contractual disputes, Cardinal was removed from the project in 1998 before it was completed, but he continued to provide input into the building's design.\n\nIn 2008, his firm was hired by the Kirkland Foundation to design a museum/convention center in Union City, Tenn.  The [[Discovery Park of America]] was to be a unique structure housing a multi level museum with artifacts from across the nation as well as provide a place for large conventions/meetings for the community.  Early in 2009 the firm's contract was terminated with the owner, and all construction activity was halted, due to undisclosed differences between the two parties.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Douglas Cardinal.jpg|thumb|193x193px|Douglas Cardinal in 1970s]] -->\n\n=== Architectural Style and Philosophy ===\nThroughout his early years, Douglas Cardinal was dealing with racism and societal ideas of conformity for both his lifestyle and architecture. Only in his years in Texas he started to fully embrace his indigenous heritage and learn more about it.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=26}}</ref> In 1970s Cardinal developed his trademark architectural style with organic curvilinear forms. In those years he started wearing native clothes and necklaces, as well as becoming an advocate for indigenous rights.<ref name=\":2\" /> This spiritual connection with his native culture affected and influenced his work and unique architectural approach. Many philosophical ideas of indigenous history include its respect and sensibility towards nature, humans' inseparable relationship with the environment and land. These concepts resulted in his use of natural materials, organic shapes, soil and sun studies, as well as creating spaces that move people spiritually and make them appreciative of their surroundings. The native philosophy is also very contrasting from the Western civilization worldview due to its use of time. It is appreciative of resilience of nature and its ability to withstand hard conditions. Therefore, its architecture aims to last for seven generations, as opposed to the economically driven and efficient approach of the patriachial society.<ref name=\":0\" />\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:St. Mary's Church, Red Deer, Alberta.jpg|left|thumb|Cardinal's first building - St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta]] -->\n\n=== St. Mary's Church ===\nSt. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta is Cardinal's first building. Upon his return to Alberta, Cardinal met with Father Werner Merx, who wanted the new church be innovative and unique. The archbishop of the church has already appointed another architect for the job, but Merx insisted on hiring Cardinal and realizing his vision. The archbishop whom they needed to convince turned out to be Anthony Jordan, who helped to resolve legal case for Cardinal 10 years earlier. Douglas Cardinal was approved for a job.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=22}}</ref>\n\nThe church has 750 seats inside and includes tubular skylights for natural daylight. Cardinal started his first project in 1967 and it turned out to be so challenging that he doubted if he could survive its completion. However, the building became one of his iconic designs that determined his architectural style. He combined all of his philosophical and cultural ideas and created a church that represented his many beliefs towards the nature and organic forms, that is unique and unprecedented for its time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=24}}</ref>\n\n=== Canadian Museum of History ===\n[[File:Gatineau - QC - Museum of Civilisation2.jpg|thumb|Canadian Museum of History|alt=]]This building, opened in 1989 as Canadian Museum of Civilization at the time, is another project that is very representative of Cardinal's architectural style. Influenced by his indigenous heritage it focuses on the response to its surroundings. It is located on the banks of the Ottawa River, facing [[Parliament Hill]]. All the massive government buildings in the city center are clustered and turned away from the river. Cardinal opened the Great Hall towards the river, making it the only building in the area that is responding to it. This approach also translated into the wrapping facade with curves that can embrace and invite people inside and create welcoming environment.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=28}}</ref> The envelope of the building is shaped in an organic form, as if sculptured by the forces of nature. He also wanted to acknowledge his appreciation for the Parliament by using the same limestone as the one used in the building. Besides responding to the site conditions, the museum also engages with its historic context by including totem poles and native murals inside the building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=29}}</ref> He wanted the space inside feel alive and dynamic, and not limit its form to the programmatic requirements.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=34}}</ref> Former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau also encouraged Cardinal to create a museum where people embrace their different backgrounds and learn from each other. Prime minister's idea for multicultural Canadian society aligned well with Cardinal's vision.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=31}}</ref> The overall concept and purpose of the building corresponded with his ideas. However, in 1984 new government was not approving of Cardinal's design. He then lost his team on the project and was not fully paid for his previous work. This was a tremendous loss for the architect, but he was too driven to fulfill this project and was not willing to give up. After long years of defending his design, he eventually finished the museum and it became on of his many fundamental projects.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n=== The Group of Seven ===\nIn 20th century, there were several artistic hierarchies, such as [[Group of Seven (artists)|Canadian Group of Seven]]. Cardinal was part of a similar group that included Greatest Canadian Postwar Architects, along with Moshe Safdie, Raymond Moriyama, Eberhard Zeidler, Arthur Erickson, Ray Affleck and Ron Thom. This environment was encouraging for the architect and they often shared ideas and passion to create great architecture.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=36}}</ref> Although all of their styles and conceptual vision were different, they all agreed on creating with meaning and beauty, instead of commercial skyscrapers of that era. However, his personal and financial problems often made him lose his direction and consequently he did not receive as much recognition as his peers.<ref name=\":3\" /> These instances include his design of the Grand Prairie Regional College in Alberta. Opened in 1974, this project did not meet government's simplistic and modernistic vision for the project and went over budget.\n\n==Works==\nAmong the many projects Cardinal has completed in his career are the following:<ref name=Doyle>{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Richard I.|title=Renaissance II: Canadian creativity and innovation in the new millennium|year=2001|publisher=Intercept Ltd|isbn=978-0-660-18397-8|pages=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WrhJnmXdBIC&pg=PA38&dq=Douglas+Cardinal#v=onepage&q=Douglas%20Cardinal&f=false}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nSpruce Grove City Hall.jpg|Spruce Grove City Hall (1981) in [[Spruce Grove]], [[Alberta]]\nSpace-and-Science-Centre-Edmonton-Alberta.jpg|[[Edmonton Space and Science Centre|Edmonton Space And Science Centre]] (1984) Coronation Park, [[Edmonton, Alberta]], which has since been renovated and rebranded as the [[Telus World of Science]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\nGatineau - QC - Museum of Civilisation3.jpg|[[Canadian Museum of History]] (1989) in [[Gatineau, Quebec]], opposite [[Parliament Hill]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\nYork Region Administrative Centre 02.jpg|[[York Regional Council#York Region Administrative Centre|York Region Administrative Centre]] (1992) in [[Newmarket, Ontario]]\nNational Museum of the American Indian.JPG|[[Smithsonian]] [[National Museum of the American Indian]] (1993\u20131998) [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>\nOuj\u00e9-Bougoumou.jpg|Cultural Institute (1996) [[Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou, Qu\u00e9bec]]\nFirst Nations University 4.jpg|[[First Nations University of Canada|First Nations University]] (2003) in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]\nGordon Oakes Red Bear Centre.jpg|Gordon Oakes Red Bear Centre (2016) at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]\n</gallery>\n* St. Mary's Church (1968) [[Red Deer, Alberta]]<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\n* St. Albert Place & City Hall (1976) [[St. Albert, Alberta]]\n* Alberta Government Services (Provincial) Building (1976) [[Ponoka, Alberta]]\n* [[Grande Prairie Regional College]] (1976) [[Grande Prairie]], [[Alberta]]\n* Leighton Artist Colony, at the Banff Centre (1985) [[Banff, Alberta]]\n*Wabano Centre (2013) [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Grotski Residence (1978) [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]]\n*Bonneville Rehabilitation Centre [[Bonnyville|Bonnyville, Alberta]]\n*Ojigkwanong Students Centre, Carleton University, [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Ile a la Crosse Elementary School [[\u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse|\u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan]]\n*Cardinal Studio [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]]\n*Ouje' Bougoumou Village, [[Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou|Ouje' Bougoumou, Quebec]]\n*Janvier Gallery [[Cold Lake, Alberta]]\n*Grand Traverse Civic Centre Ottawa, Ontario\n*Circle of Life Thunderbird Place (2001) [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]]\n*Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall (1991) [[Gatineau|Gatineau, Quebec]]\n*Kanai Middle School (1996) Sioux Valley, Manitoba\n*Iskotew Healing Lodge [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]\n*Sioux Valley (1986) Sioux Valley, Manitoba\n*Cardinal Residence (1982) [[Stony Plain, Alberta]]\n*Fairview Elementary School (1975) [[Red Deer, Alberta]]\n*Precam Elementary School (1976) La Ronge, Edmonton\n*Long Point First Nation, [[Winneway|Winneway,\u00a0Quebec]]\n*Me-No-Ya Win Health Centre (2010) [[Sioux Lookout|Sioux lookout, Ontario]]\n*Adelante Healthcare Goodyear Project (2018) [[Mesa, Arizona]]\n*Gordon Oakes Redbear Students Centre (2016) [[Saskatoon|Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]]\n*Unceded: Voices of the Land Exhibition (2018) [[Venice Biennale]]\n\n== Achievements ==\n\n=== Writings ===\n\n* ''Of the Spirit,'' NeWest Press (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada), 1977.<ref name=\":4\">Douglas Joseph Cardinal.

Her Irish Catholic family did not accept of their relationship because of his heritage and the two of them eloped. This also was a problem, because Cardinal had charges pressed against him as an interracial marriage was illegal at the time. He was defended by the archbishop lawyer Anthony Jordan and was not found guilty. Deirdre then was pressured to move back with her family, and was raising their first daughter alone.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nShortly before he decided to go the Unites States, he started a relationship with Carole Olson. She accompanied him on a road trip 1957 to Texas and they later got married. They had three children - Nancy, Guy and Bret. The couple split during their years in America due to his preoccupation with work.<ref name=\":7\" /> His son Bret is also an architect and has worked with his father for 25 years until he started his own architecture firm.\n\nHe married Marylin Zahar in 1973, with whom he had two children - Lisa and Jean-Marc.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHis current wife Idoia Arana-Beobide is also of Basque indigenous heritage. Together they have two children.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|date=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=46}}</ref> His wife works as a director at his architectural firm.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHall, J.
