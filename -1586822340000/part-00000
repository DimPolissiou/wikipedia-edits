{"title_page": "Lakeview Cemetery (Burlington, Vermont)", "text_new": "[[File:Lakeview cemetery (Burlington, VT).jpg|thumb|Main entrance to Lakeview Cemetery off Burlington, Vermont's North Avenue.]]\n'''Lakeview Cemetery''' is a burial ground located off of North Avenue in [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], [[Chittenden County, Vermont]].  The cemetery was created in 1867 and dedicated in 1871, and overlooks [[Lake Champlain]].  It is near the current campus of [[Burlington High School (Vermont)|Burlington High School]].\n\n==Details==\nLakeview Cemetery is a non-denominational cemetery owned by the city of Burlington.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The cemetery's [[Howard Mortuary Chapel|Louisa Howard Chapel]] is available for rent, and is frequently used for marriage ceremonies, funerals, memorial services, music recitals, and other functions.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The city government's management of the cemetery is aided by the Friends of Lakeview Cemetery, a group formed in the early 1990s to plan improvements to the cemetery buildings and grounds and raise money to carry them out.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\n==History==\nLakeview Cemetery was established in 1867 when the city of Burlington purchased 23 acres of land from H. B. Sawyer for $3,500 (about $65,000 in 2019).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  In 1868, the city purchased an additional seven from J. A. Arthur for $2,000 (about $38,000 in 2019).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\nThe cemetery was planned in the [[rural cemetery]] style that became popular in the mid 1800s.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Located at what was then the outskirts of the city and situated near the end of the city's [[tram|trolley car line]], Lakeview included many of the attributes of a park.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Its narrow, meandering roads, benches, and [[Ornamental plant|specimen trees]] helped make it an outdoor destination for city dwellers, who visited for picnics and other activities.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\nIn the 1880s, philanthropist Louisa Howard financed the construction of a small church on the cemetery grounds.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  When the stone [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Gothic Revival]] building was dedicated in 1882, it was named in her honor.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The [[Howard Mortuary Chapel|Louisa Howard Chapel]] fell into disuse during the 1940s, but in the 1990s a group of interested individuals formed Friends of Lakeview Cemetery, which raised funds to refurbish it.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  By 2004, the group had raised $100,000, and the chapel underwent a restoration that was completed in 2006.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Other improvements and restorations undertaken by Friends of Lakeview Cemetery include construction of a new gazebo in 2010 to replace an original that had fallen into disrepair.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The new cedar wood gazebo was crafted by hand in the 19th Century [[Adirondack Architecture]] style so that it resembled the original.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\nLakeview's grounds included three fountains that were donated in the 1870s by John P. Howard (Louisa Howard's brother).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}} In 2014, Friends of Lakeview Cemetery completed restoration of the fountains, using the remnants of the originals and a photo from a vintage postcard for reference.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\n==Interments==\nBurials at Lakeview Cemetery include veterans of every major conflict since the [[American Civil War]], including several members of the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]], a Union Army regiment of [[African American]] soldiers and white officers.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Several soldiers who served at nearby [[Fort Ethan Allen]] in the late 1800s and early 1900s are buried at Lakeview, including members of the famed [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry Regiment]] (Buffalo Soldiers).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\n==Notable burials==\nMany notable political and military leaders and other prominent individuals are interred at Lakeview Cemetery, to include:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Harold J.

There are, however, some interesting connections. [[Lord Kelvin]] in his early work on the transmission line<ref>Thomson, William, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1854RSPS....7..382T \"On the Theory of the Electric Telegraph\"], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', '''Vol 7''', pp. 382\u2013399. {{doi|10.1098/rspl.1854.0093}}</ref> derived the properties of the electric line by analogy with heat conduction.<ref>Hunt, B J, [https://books.google.com/books?id=23rBH11Q9w8C&pg=PA63 ''The Maxwellians''], p. 63, Cornell University Press, 2005 {{ISBN|0-8014-8234-8}}.</ref>  This is based on [[Conduction (heat)#Fourier's law|Fourier's law]] and the [[Heat equation|Fourier conduction equation]].  Ingersoll and Zobel describe the work of Kelvin and Fourier in their book<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 9\u201314.</ref> and Kelvin's approach to the representation of [[propagation constant|transmission function]]s would consequently have been very familiar to Zobel.  It is therefore no surprise that in Zobel's paper on the electric wave filter<ref>Zobel, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> a very similar representation is found for the transmission function of filters.\n\nSolutions to the Fourier equation can be provided by [[Fourier series]].<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Ingersoll and Zobel state that in many cases the calculation involved makes the solution \"well-nigh impossible\" by analytical means.  With modern technology such a calculation is trivially easy, but Ingersoll and Zobel recommend the use of harmonic analysers, which are the mechanical counterpart of today's [[spectrum analyser]]s.  These machines add together mechanical oscillations of various frequencies, phases and amplitudes by combining them through a set of pulleys or springs; one for each oscillator.  The reverse process is also possible, driving the machine with the function and measuring the Fourier components as output.<ref>Ingersoll and Zobel, pp. 62\u201364.</ref>\n\n==Background to AT&T research==\nAfter the work of [[John R. Carson]] in 1915<ref>Carson, J R, ''Electric Circuit Theory and Operational Calculus'', 1926, McGraw-Hill, New York.</ref> it became clear that [[multiplexed]] telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of [[single sideband]] suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the [[frequency domain]] consists of a [[Carrier wave|carrier]] and two [[sidebands]]. The [[carrier wave]] in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple [[tuned circuit]]s. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum [[Selectivity (electronic)|rejection]] of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent [[crosstalk]]. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.<ref>Bray, pp. 61,&nbsp;63.</ref>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; ; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:20em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''Electric wave filters'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 90%;\" | The term ''electric wave filter'' was much used around Zobel's time to mean a filter designed to pass or reject waves of specified frequencies across the band. It appears in numerous papers published in the early 20th century. Sometimes used to distinguish these more advanced designs from the simple tuned circuits which preceded them. In modern usage the simpler term ''filter'' would be used and is unambiguous within the field of electronics.\n|}\n[[George A. Campbell]] and Zobel worked on this problem of extracting a single sideband from an amplitude-modulated composite wave for use in [[multiplexing]] telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal at the far end of the transmission.<ref name=Bray62/><ref name=\"White, 2000\"/>\n\nInitially, the [[baseband]] pass range used was 200&nbsp;Hz to 2500&nbsp;Hz but later the [[International Telecommunication Union]] set a standard of 300&nbsp;Hz to 3.4&nbsp;kHz with 4&nbsp;kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop in the space of 900&nbsp;Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.<ref>Bray, pp. 62, 64.</ref>\n\nCampbell had previously utilised the [[Heaviside condition|condition]] discovered in the work of [[Oliver Heaviside]] for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using [[lumped component]] inductors ([[loading coils]]). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using [[ladder network]] topology using capacitors and inductors. [[Low-pass filter|Low-pass]], [[high-pass]] and [[band-pass]] filters were designed. Sharper [[Cutoff frequency|cut-offs]] and higher [[stop-band]] rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell<ref>Campbell, G A, \"Physical Theory of the Electric Wave-Filter\", ''Bell System Tech J'', November 1922, vol 1, no 2, pp. 1\u201332.</ref> were described by Zobel as [[constant k filters]] although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.<ref>Bray, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Innovations==\nAfter Zobel arrived at the Engineering Department of AT&T he used his mathematical skills to further improve the design of electric wave filters. Carson and Zobel developed the mathematical method of analyzing the behavior of filters now known as the [[Image impedance|image]] method whereby the impedance and transmission parameters of each section are calculated as if it is part of an infinite chain of identical sections.<ref>Chu, W, Chung-Kwei Chang, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1686520 ''Transients of Resistance-Terminated Dissipative Low-Pass and High-Pass Electric Wave Filters''], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 26, no 10, pp. 1266\u20131277, October 1938</ref>\n\n===Wave filters===\n[[Image:Zobel original drawing.PNG|thumbnail|right|450 px|An original drawing by Zobel of a band-pass filter used for impedance matching|alt=A circuit consisting of a series resonator (i.e., an inductor and capacitor in series), a shunt anti-resonator (i.e., the same devices in parallel), another series resonator in parallel with an inductor and a capacitor, and a terminating resistor. Component values are marked as multiples of the components of a prototype filter (not shown).]]\nZobel invented the [[M-derived filter|m-derived (or m-type) filter]] section in 1920, the distinguishing feature of this design being a [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] of attenuation close to the filter [[cut-off frequency]]. The result of this design is a filter response which falls very rapidly past the cut-off frequency. A fast transition between [[pass-band]] and [[stop-band]] was one of the primary requirements for cramming as many telephone channels as possible into one cable.<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/><ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', p. 65.</ref>\n\nOne disadvantage of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, the response of the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again.<ref>Ghosh, Smarajit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbP7rfG2YYC ''Network Theory: Analysis and Synthesis''], Prentice Hall of India, pp. 564\u2013569.</ref> Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel the advantages of both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.<ref>Zobel, pp. 26\u201328.</ref>\n\nBy 1921 Zobel had further perfected his composite filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections at the ends of his composite filters to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load,<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/> a technique in which he held a patent.<ref name=\"aniseed ball\">Zobel, O J, ''Terminating network for filters'', {{US patent|1557229}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> The difficulty that he was trying to overcome was that the [[image impedance]] techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6<ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', pp. 72\u201374.</ref><ref>''Redifon Radio Diary, 1970'', p. 47, William Collins Sons & Co, 1969</ref> for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.<ref name=Bray62/><ref>Shea, T E, ''Transmission Networks and Wave Filters'', 1929, Bell Telephone Laboratories.</ref>\n\nAround 1923, Zobel's filter designs were reaching the peak of their complexity. He now had a filter section to which he had doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the [[constant k filter|k-type]]. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with [[Passivity (engineering)#Passive filter|conventional LC technology]]. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.<ref name=\"humbug\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1850146}}, filed 25 Nov 1930, issued 22 March 1932.</ref>\n\n===Transmission line simulation===\nZobel directed much of his effort in the 1920s to constructing networks which could simulate transmission lines. These networks were derived from filter sections, which themselves had been derived from transmission line theory and the filters were used on transmission line signals.  In turn, these artificial lines were used to develop and test better filter sections.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical network'', {{US patent|1760973}}, filed 27 March 1928, issued 3 June 1930.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1720777}}, filed 9 Sept 1926, issued 16 July 1929.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1591073}}, filed 15 Dec 1922, issued 6 July 1926.</ref>\nZobel used a design technique based on his theoretical discovery that the impedance looking into the end of a filter chain was practically the same (within the limits of component tolerances) as the theoretical impedance of an infinite chain after only a small number of sections had been added to the chain. These \"image\" impedances have a mathematical characterization impossible to construct simply out of discrete components, and can only ever be approximated. Zobel found that using these impedances constructed out of small filter chains as components in a greater network allowed him to build realistic line simulators. These were not in any sense intended as practical filters in the field, but rather the intention was to construct good controllable line simulators without having the inconvenience of miles of cable to contend with.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Selective Constant-Resistance Network'', {{US patent|1724987}}, filed 13 April 1928, issued 20 Aug 1929.</ref>\n\n===Equalisers===\nZobel invented several filters whose defining characteristic was a [[constant-resistance network|constant resistance]] as the input impedance. The resistance remained constant through the pass band and the stop band. With these designs Zobel had completely solved the impedance matching problem.  The main application of these sections has been not so much for filtering out unwanted frequencies, the k-type and m-type filters remained best for this, but rather to equalize the response in the pass band to a flat response.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network and Method of Transmitting Electric Currents'', {{US patent|1603305}}, filed 9 Aug 1922, issued 19 Oct 1926.</ref>\n\nPerhaps one of Zobel's most fascinating inventions is the [[Lattice phase equaliser|lattice filter]] section. This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, yet it is constructed out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is the phase of the signal at different frequencies.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Phase-shifting network'', {{US patent|1792523}}, filed 12 March 1927, issued 17 Feb 1931.</ref>\n\n===Impedance matching===\nA common theme throughout Zobel's work is the issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.<ref name=\"humbug\"/>\n\nThis impedance matching approach not only led to better filters but the techniques developed could be used to construct circuits whose sole purpose was to match together two disparate impedances.<ref name=\"chewing gum\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1615252}}, filed 9 June 1923, issued 25 Jan 1927.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Complementary filter'', {{US patent|1557230}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> Zobel continued to invent impedance matching networks throughout his career. During [[World War II]] he moved on to [[waveguide filter]]s for use in the newly developed [[radar]] technology.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Little was published during the war for obvious reasons but towards the end with Bell Labs in the 1950s, Zobel designs for sections to match physically different waveguide sizes appear.<ref name=\"lemon drop\"/><ref name=\"pear drop\"/>  However, the circuit noted above which still bears Zobel's name today, the constant-resistance network, can be viewed as an impedance matching circuit and remains Zobel's finest achievement in this regard.<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/>\n\n==Loudspeaker equalisation==\nThe name of Zobel is, perhaps, most well known with regard to impedance compensation networks for loudspeakers and his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to this is where he speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable,<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/> or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the [[hybrid transformer]] which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a [[phantom circuit]].<ref name=\"chewing gum\"/>\n\n==Noise==\nWhile Carson led the way theoretically, Zobel was involved in the design of filters for the purpose of noise reduction on transmission systems.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 5\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Background===\nAt the beginning of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external [[Static (radio)|static]]. In modern terminology, this would include random ([[thermal noise|thermal]] and [[shot noise|shot]]) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] in 1918 on shot noise.<ref>Schottky, W, \"Uber spontane Stromschwankungen in verschiedenen Elecktrizit\u00e4tsleitern\", ''Annalen der Physik'', verte folge, Band 57, 1918, pp. 541\u2013567.</ref> To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing [[directional antenna]]e and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 3\u20135.</ref>\n\nFor telephone engineers, what was then called \"fluctuating noise\", and would now be described as random noise, i.e. shot and thermal noise, was much more noticeable than with early radio systems. Carson broadened the radio engineers' concept of signal-to-static ratio to a more general [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and introduced a figure of merit for noise.<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1666797 \"Signal-to-Static-Interference Ratio in Radio Telephony\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol 11, June 1923, pp. 271\u2013274.</ref><ref>Schwartz, pp. 1, 5.</ref>\n\n===Impossibility of noise cancellation===\nThe radio engineers' preoccupation with static and the techniques being used to reduce it led to the idea that noise could be totally eliminated by, in some way, compensating for it or canceling it out. The culmination of this viewpoint was expressed in a 1928 paper by [[Edwin Armstrong]].<ref>Armstrong, E H, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1669871 \"Methods of Reducing the Effect of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol. 16 no 1, January 1928, pp. 15\u201326.</ref> This led to a famous retort by Carson in a subsequent paper, \"Noise, like the poor, will always be with us\".<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1670079 \"The Reduction of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 16 no 7, July 1928, pp. 966\u2013975.</ref>  Armstrong was technically in the wrong in this exchange, but in 1933, ironically and paradoxically, went on to invent wide-band [[FM broadcasting|FM]] which enormously improved the noise performance of radio by ''increasing'' the bandwidth.<ref>Armstrong, A H, ''Radiosignaling'', {{US Patent|1941069}}, filed 24 January 1933, issued 26 December 1933</ref>\n\nCarson and Zobel in 1923 had conclusively shown that filtering cannot remove noise to the same degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of [[Fourier analysis]] to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call [[White noise|band-limited white noise]]. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.<ref name=TransientOscillation>Carson, J R and Zobel, O J, \"Transient Oscillation in Electric Wave Filters\", ''Bell System Technical Journal'', vol. 2, July 1923, pp. 1\u201329.</ref>\n\nAlthough this work by Carson and Zobel was very early, it was not universally accepted that noise could be analyzed in the frequency domain in this way. For this reason, the aforementioned  exchange between Carson and Armstrong was still possible years later. The precise mathematical relationship between noise power and bandwidth for random noise was finally determined by [[Harry Nyquist]] in 1928 thus giving a theoretical limit to what could be achieved by filtering.<ref>Nyquist, H, \"Thermal Agitation of Electric Charges in Conductors\", ''Physical Review'', vol. 32, July 1928, pp. 110\u2013113. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRev.32.110}}</ref>\n\nThis work on noise produced the concept, and led Zobel to pursue the design, of [[matched filter]]s.  In this context matched means that the filter is chosen to match the signal's characteristics in order to admit all of the available signal without admitting any noise that could have been excluded. The underlying insight is that admitting as much signal as is available without admitting any noise that could be excluded will maximize the signal to noise ratio. When the signal to noise ratio is maximized, the noise performance of the equipment is optimal. This conclusion was the culmination of theoretical research into removing noise by the application of [[linear filters]].  This became important in the development of radar during the Second World War in which Zobel played a part.<ref>Schwartz, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Use of work in genetic programming research==\nZobel's work has recently found an application in research into [[genetic programming]]. The purpose of this research is to attempt to demonstrate that the results obtained from genetic programming are comparable to human achievements. Two of the measures that are used to determine whether a genetic programming result is human-competitive are:<ref name=\"polo\">{{cite book|author=Koza, Bennet|author2=Andre, Keane|title=Genetic Programming III: Darwinian Invention and Problem Solving|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=San Francisco|year=1999|url=http://www.genetic-programming.com/hc/zobelcrossoverfilter.html}}</ref>\n*The result is a patented invention.\n*The result is equal to or better than a result that was considered an achievement in its field at the time of discovery.\n\nOne such problem set as a task for a genetic program was to design a [[Audio crossover|crossover filter]] for [[woofer]] and [[tweeter]] loudspeakers. The output design was identical in [[Electronic filter topology|topology]] to a design found in a patent of Zobel's<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1538964}}, filed 15 Jan 1921, issued 26 May 1925.</ref> for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line. This was judged to be human-comparable, not only because of the patent, but also because the high-pass and low-pass sections were \"[[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposed]]\" as in Zobel's design, but not specifically required to be so in the programs parameters.<ref name=\"polo\"/> Whether or not Zobel's filter design would be good for a [[hi-fi]] system is another question. The design does not actually cross over, but rather, there is a gap between the two pass-bands where the signal is not transmitted to either output. Essential for multiplexing, but not so desirable for sound reproduction.<ref>Zobel's {{US patent|1538964}} (p.4, l.23) enumerates the gap as 400 Hz</ref>\n\nA later genetic programming<ref>Chakrabarti, A, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUiTdfVxJHwC&pg=PA328 ''Engineering Design Synthesis: Understanding, Approaches, and Tools''], p. 328, Springer, 2002.</ref> experiment produced a filter design which consisted of a chain of constant k sections terminated in an m-type half section.

Ingersoll and Zobel describe the work of Kelvin and Fourier in their book<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 9\u201314.</ref> and Kelvin's approach to the representation of [[propagation constant|transmission function]]s would consequently have been very familiar to Zobel.  It is therefore no surprise that in Zobel's paper on the electric wave filter<ref>Zobel, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> a very similar representation is found for the transmission function of filters.\n\nSolutions to the Fourier equation can be provided by [[Fourier series]].<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Ingersoll and Zobel state that in many cases the calculation involved makes the solution \"well-nigh impossible\" by analytical means.  With modern technology such a calculation is trivially easy, but Ingersoll and Zobel recommend the use of harmonic analysers, which are the mechanical counterpart of today's [[spectrum analyser]]s.  These machines add together mechanical oscillations of various frequencies, phases and amplitudes by combining them through a set of pulleys or springs; one for each oscillator.  The reverse process is also possible, driving the machine with the function and measuring the Fourier components as output.<ref>Ingersoll and Zobel, pp. 62\u201364.</ref>\n\n==Background to AT&T research==\nAfter the work of [[John R. Carson]] in 1915<ref>Carson, J R, ''Electric Circuit Theory and Operational Calculus'', 1926, McGraw-Hill, New York.</ref> it became clear that [[multiplexed]] telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of [[single sideband]] suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the [[frequency domain]] consists of a [[Carrier wave|carrier]] and two [[sidebands]]. The [[carrier wave]] in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple [[tuned circuit]]s. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum [[Selectivity (electronic)|rejection]] of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent [[crosstalk]]. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.<ref>Bray, pp. 61,63.</ref>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; ; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:20em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''Electric wave filters'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 90%;\" | The term ''electric wave filter'' was much used around Zobel's time to mean a filter designed to pass or reject waves of specified frequencies across the band.

In modern usage the simpler term ''filter'' would be used and is unambiguous within the field of electronics.\n|}\n[[George A. Campbell]] and Zobel worked on this problem of extracting a single sideband from an amplitude-modulated composite wave for use in [[multiplexing]] telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal at the far end of the transmission.<ref name=Bray62/><ref name=\"White, 2000\"/>\n\nInitially, the [[baseband]] pass range used was 200&nbsp;Hz to 2500&nbsp;Hz but later the [[International Telecommunication Union]] set a standard of 300&nbsp;Hz to 3.4&nbsp;kHz with 4&nbsp;kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop in the space of 900&nbsp;Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.<ref>Bray, pp. 62, 64.</ref>\n\nCampbell had previously utilised the [[Heaviside condition|condition]] discovered in the work of [[Oliver Heaviside]] for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using [[lumped component]] inductors ([[loading coils]]). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using [[ladder network]] topology using capacitors and inductors. [[Low-pass filter|Low-pass]], [[high-pass]] and [[band-pass]] filters were designed. Sharper [[Cutoff frequency|cut-offs]] and higher [[stop-band]] rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell<ref>Campbell, G A, \"Physical Theory of the Electric Wave-Filter\", ''Bell System Tech J'', November 1922, vol 1, no 2, pp. 1\u201332.</ref> were described by Zobel as [[constant k filters]] although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.<ref>Bray, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Innovations==\nAfter Zobel arrived at the Engineering Department of AT&T he used his mathematical skills to further improve the design of electric wave filters. Carson and Zobel developed the mathematical method of analyzing the behavior of filters now known as the [[Image impedance|image]] method whereby the impedance and transmission parameters of each section are calculated as if it is part of an infinite chain of identical sections.<ref>Chu, W, Chung-Kwei Chang, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1686520 ''Transients of Resistance-Terminated Dissipative Low-Pass and High-Pass Electric Wave Filters''], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 26, no 10, pp. 1266\u20131277, October 1938</ref>\n\n===Wave filters===\n[[Image:Zobel original drawing.PNG|thumbnail|right|450 px|An original drawing by Zobel of a band-pass filter used for impedance matching|alt=A circuit consisting of a series resonator (i.e., an inductor and capacitor in series), a shunt anti-resonator (i.e., the same devices in parallel), another series resonator in parallel with an inductor and a capacitor, and a terminating resistor.

The result of this design is a filter response which falls very rapidly past the cut-off frequency. A fast transition between [[pass-band]] and [[stop-band]] was one of the primary requirements for cramming as many telephone channels as possible into one cable.<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/><ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', p. 65.</ref>\n\nOne disadvantage of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, the response of the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again.<ref>Ghosh, Smarajit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbP7rfG2YYC ''Network Theory: Analysis and Synthesis''], Prentice Hall of India, pp. 564\u2013569.</ref> Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel the advantages of both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.<ref>Zobel, pp. 26\u201328.</ref>\n\nBy 1921 Zobel had further perfected his composite filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections at the ends of his composite filters to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load,<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/> a technique in which he held a patent.<ref name=\"aniseed ball\">Zobel, O J, ''Terminating network for filters'', {{US patent|1557229}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> The difficulty that he was trying to overcome was that the [[image impedance]] techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6<ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', pp. 72\u201374.</ref><ref>''Redifon Radio Diary, 1970'', p. 47, William Collins Sons & Co, 1969</ref> for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.<ref name=Bray62/><ref>Shea, T E, ''Transmission Networks and Wave Filters'', 1929, Bell Telephone Laboratories.</ref>\n\nAround 1923, Zobel's filter designs were reaching the peak of their complexity. He now had a filter section to which he had doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the [[constant k filter|k-type]]. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with [[Passivity (engineering)#Passive filter|conventional LC technology]]. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.<ref name=\"humbug\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1850146}}, filed 25 Nov 1930, issued 22 March 1932.</ref>\n\n===Transmission line simulation===\nZobel directed much of his effort in the 1920s to constructing networks which could simulate transmission lines. These networks were derived from filter sections, which themselves had been derived from transmission line theory and the filters were used on transmission line signals.  In turn, these artificial lines were used to develop and test better filter sections.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical network'', {{US patent|1760973}}, filed 27 March 1928, issued 3 June 1930.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1720777}}, filed 9 Sept 1926, issued 16 July 1929.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1591073}}, filed 15 Dec 1922, issued 6 July 1926.</ref>\nZobel used a design technique based on his theoretical discovery that the impedance looking into the end of a filter chain was practically the same (within the limits of component tolerances) as the theoretical impedance of an infinite chain after only a small number of sections had been added to the chain. These \"image\" impedances have a mathematical characterization impossible to construct simply out of discrete components, and can only ever be approximated. Zobel found that using these impedances constructed out of small filter chains as components in a greater network allowed him to build realistic line simulators. These were not in any sense intended as practical filters in the field, but rather the intention was to construct good controllable line simulators without having the inconvenience of miles of cable to contend with.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Selective Constant-Resistance Network'', {{US patent|1724987}}, filed 13 April 1928, issued 20 Aug 1929.</ref>\n\n===Equalisers===\nZobel invented several filters whose defining characteristic was a [[constant-resistance network|constant resistance]] as the input impedance. The resistance remained constant through the pass band and the stop band. With these designs Zobel had completely solved the impedance matching problem.  The main application of these sections has been not so much for filtering out unwanted frequencies, the k-type and m-type filters remained best for this, but rather to equalize the response in the pass band to a flat response.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network and Method of Transmitting Electric Currents'', {{US patent|1603305}}, filed 9 Aug 1922, issued 19 Oct 1926.</ref>\n\nPerhaps one of Zobel's most fascinating inventions is the [[Lattice phase equaliser|lattice filter]] section. This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, yet it is constructed out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is the phase of the signal at different frequencies.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Phase-shifting network'', {{US patent|1792523}}, filed 12 March 1927, issued 17 Feb 1931.</ref>\n\n===Impedance matching===\nA common theme throughout Zobel's work is the issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.<ref name=\"humbug\"/>\n\nThis impedance matching approach not only led to better filters but the techniques developed could be used to construct circuits whose sole purpose was to match together two disparate impedances.<ref name=\"chewing gum\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1615252}}, filed 9 June 1923, issued 25 Jan 1927.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Complementary filter'', {{US patent|1557230}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> Zobel continued to invent impedance matching networks throughout his career. During [[World War II]] he moved on to [[waveguide filter]]s for use in the newly developed [[radar]] technology.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Little was published during the war for obvious reasons but towards the end with Bell Labs in the 1950s, Zobel designs for sections to match physically different waveguide sizes appear.<ref name=\"lemon drop\"/><ref name=\"pear drop\"/>  However, the circuit noted above which still bears Zobel's name today, the constant-resistance network, can be viewed as an impedance matching circuit and remains Zobel's finest achievement in this regard.<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/>\n\n==Loudspeaker equalisation==\nThe name of Zobel is, perhaps, most well known with regard to impedance compensation networks for loudspeakers and his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to this is where he speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable,<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/> or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the [[hybrid transformer]] which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a [[phantom circuit]].<ref name=\"chewing gum\"/>\n\n==Noise==\nWhile Carson led the way theoretically, Zobel was involved in the design of filters for the purpose of noise reduction on transmission systems.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 5\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Background===\nAt the beginning of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external [[Static (radio)|static]]. In modern terminology, this would include random ([[thermal noise|thermal]] and [[shot noise|shot]]) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] in 1918 on shot noise.<ref>Schottky, W, \"Uber spontane Stromschwankungen in verschiedenen Elecktrizit\u00e4tsleitern\", ''Annalen der Physik'', verte folge, Band 57, 1918, pp. 541\u2013567.</ref> To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing [[directional antenna]]e and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 3\u20135.</ref>\n\nFor telephone engineers, what was then called \"fluctuating noise\", and would now be described as random noise, i.e. shot and thermal noise, was much more noticeable than with early radio systems. Carson broadened the radio engineers' concept of signal-to-static ratio to a more general [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and introduced a figure of merit for noise.<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1666797 \"Signal-to-Static-Interference Ratio in Radio Telephony\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol 11, June 1923, pp. 271\u2013274.</ref><ref>Schwartz, pp. 1, 5.</ref>\n\n===Impossibility of noise cancellation===\nThe radio engineers' preoccupation with static and the techniques being used to reduce it led to the idea that noise could be totally eliminated by, in some way, compensating for it or canceling it out. The culmination of this viewpoint was expressed in a 1928 paper by [[Edwin Armstrong]].<ref>Armstrong, E H, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1669871 \"Methods of Reducing the Effect of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol. 16 no 1, January 1928, pp. 15\u201326.</ref> This led to a famous retort by Carson in a subsequent paper, \"Noise, like the poor, will always be with us\".<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1670079 \"The Reduction of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 16 no 7, July 1928, pp. 966\u2013975.</ref>  Armstrong was technically in the wrong in this exchange, but in 1933, ironically and paradoxically, went on to invent wide-band [[FM broadcasting|FM]] which enormously improved the noise performance of radio by ''increasing'' the bandwidth.<ref>Armstrong, A H, ''Radiosignaling'', {{US Patent|1941069}}, filed 24 January 1933, issued 26 December 1933</ref>\n\nCarson and Zobel in 1923 had conclusively shown that filtering cannot remove noise to the same degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of [[Fourier analysis]] to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call [[White noise|band-limited white noise]]. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.<ref name=TransientOscillation>Carson, J R and Zobel, O J, \"Transient Oscillation in Electric Wave Filters\", ''Bell System Technical Journal'', vol. 2, July 1923, pp. 1\u201329.</ref>\n\nAlthough this work by Carson and Zobel was very early, it was not universally accepted that noise could be analyzed in the frequency domain in this way. For this reason, the aforementioned  exchange between Carson and Armstrong was still possible years later. The precise mathematical relationship between noise power and bandwidth for random noise was finally determined by [[Harry Nyquist]] in 1928 thus giving a theoretical limit to what could be achieved by filtering.<ref>Nyquist, H, \"Thermal Agitation of Electric Charges in Conductors\", ''Physical Review'', vol. 32, July 1928, pp. 110\u2013113. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRev.32.110}}</ref>\n\nThis work on noise produced the concept, and led Zobel to pursue the design, of [[matched filter]]s.  In this context matched means that the filter is chosen to match the signal's characteristics in order to admit all of the available signal without admitting any noise that could have been excluded. The underlying insight is that admitting as much signal as is available without admitting any noise that could be excluded will maximize the signal to noise ratio. When the signal to noise ratio is maximized, the noise performance of the equipment is optimal. This conclusion was the culmination of theoretical research into removing noise by the application of [[linear filters]].  This became important in the development of radar during the Second World War in which Zobel played a part.<ref>Schwartz, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Use of work in genetic programming research==\nZobel's work has recently found an application in research into [[genetic programming]]. The purpose of this research is to attempt to demonstrate that the results obtained from genetic programming are comparable to human achievements. Two of the measures that are used to determine whether a genetic programming result is human-competitive are:<ref name=\"polo\">{{cite book|author=Koza, Bennet|author2=Andre, Keane|title=Genetic Programming III: Darwinian Invention and Problem Solving|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=San Francisco|year=1999|url=http://www.genetic-programming.com/hc/zobelcrossoverfilter.html}}</ref>\n*The result is a patented invention.\n*The result is equal to or better than a result that was considered an achievement in its field at the time of discovery.\n\nOne such problem set as a task for a genetic program was to design a [[Audio crossover|crossover filter]] for [[woofer]] and [[tweeter]] loudspeakers. The output design was identical in [[Electronic filter topology|topology]] to a design found in a patent of Zobel's<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1538964}}, filed 15 Jan 1921, issued 26 May 1925.</ref> for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line. This was judged to be human-comparable, not only because of the patent, but also because the high-pass and low-pass sections were \"[[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposed]]\" as in Zobel's design, but not specifically required to be so in the programs parameters.<ref name=\"polo\"/> Whether or not Zobel's filter design would be good for a [[hi-fi]] system is another question. The design does not actually cross over, but rather, there is a gap between the two pass-bands where the signal is not transmitted to either output. Essential for multiplexing, but not so desirable for sound reproduction.<ref>Zobel's {{US patent|1538964}} (p.4, l.23) enumerates the gap as 400 Hz</ref>\n\nA later genetic programming<ref>Chakrabarti, A, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUiTdfVxJHwC&pg=PA328 ''Engineering Design Synthesis: Understanding, Approaches, and Tools''], p. 328, Springer, 2002.</ref> experiment produced a filter design which consisted of a chain of constant k sections terminated in an m-type half section. This was also determined to have been a design patented by Zobel.<ref name=\"aniseed ball\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*[[John Bray (communications engineer)|Bray, J]], ''Innovation and the Communications Revolution'', [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]], 2002 {{ISBN|0-85296-218-5}}.\n*Leonard, R, Zobel, O J, Ingersoll, A C, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cjyREwANqwUC&pg=PP1 ''An Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Heat Conduction with Engineering and Geological Applications''], 1913, Ginn and Co, Boston, New York.\n*Matthaei, G L; Young, L; Jones, E M T, ''Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures'' McGraw-Hill 1964 (1980 edition is {{ISBN|0-89006-099-1}}).\n*Schwartz, M, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090420124216/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/symposiums/SchwartzM-paper.pdf Improving the Noise Performance of Communication Systems: 1920s to early 1930s]\", ''Technologies, Technologists & Networks: A Symposium on the History of Communication Technologies'', October 17, 2007, Smithsonian National Postal Museum.\n*Zobel, O J,''Theory and Design of Uniform and Composite Electric Wave Filters'', Bell System Technical Journal, '''Vol. 2''' (1923), pp.&nbsp;1\u201346.\n\n{{Authority control}}<!--old VIAF number; no longer works: 228155844; another cluster at: 218312213-->\n\n{{featured article}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Biography|Electronics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zobel, Otto Julius}}\n[[Category:1887 births]]\n[[Category:1970 deaths]]\n[[Category:American electrical engineers]]\n[[Category:American electronics engineers]]\n[[Category:Engineers from Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:People from Ripon, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:People from Morristown, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Radio pioneers]]\n[[Category:Ripon College (Wisconsin) alumni]]\n[[Category:Scientists at Bell Labs]]\n[[Category:University of Minnesota faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison alumni]]\n[[Category:Engineers from New Jersey]]\n[[Category:20th-century American inventors]]\n", "name_user": "Eisfbnore", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBackground to AT&T research:nbsp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Julius_Zobel"}

Years before her debut in the music industry, she took part in the contest ''Zhas Kanat'', a national music festival which aimed to launch the careers of amateur and new singers. After her performance in the festival, well-known producer Bayan Esentayeva became interested in her voice. She was hailed for her powerful voice and her beauty. In late 2012, she released her first single \"S\u00fa\u0131emin deshi\" ({{lang-kk|\u0421\u04af\u0439\u0435\u043c\u0456\u043d \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0456}}), which was used as a song in the soundtrack of the movie \"\u01f4ashyq j\u00farek\" ({{lang-kk|\u0492\u0430\u0448\u044b\u049b \u0436\u04af\u0440\u0435\u043a}}, ''A cocktail with stars'') where she also had a role.

Years before her debut in the music industry, she took part in the contest ''Zhas Kanat'', a national music festival which aimed to launch the careers of amateur and new singers. After her performance in the festival, well-known producer Bayan Esentayeva became interested in her voice. She was hailed for her powerful voice and her beauty. In late 2012, she released her first single \"S\u00fa\u0131emin deshi\" ({{lang-kk|\u0421\u04af\u0439\u0435\u043c\u0456\u043d \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0456}}), which was used as a song in the soundtrack of the movie \"\u01f4ashyq j\u00farek\" ({{lang-kk|\u0492\u0430\u0448\u044b\u049b \u0436\u04af\u0440\u0435\u043a}}, ''A cocktail with stars'') where she also had a role.

Thanks to the enormous promotional effort by Bayan Esentayeva, the popularity of the band increased, producing many more hit singles including \"Qazaq qyzdary\" ({{lang-kk|\u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b \u049b\u044b\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044b}}, ''Kazakh girls'').

The band's lineup consists of founding members [[Jeff Ament]] (bass guitar), [[Stone Gossard]] (rhythm guitar), [[Mike McCready]] (lead guitar), and [[Eddie Vedder]] (lead vocals, guitar), as well as [[Matt Cameron]] (drums), who joined in 1998. Keyboardist [[Boom Gaspar]] has also been a touring/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers [[Jack Irons]], [[Dave Krusen]], [[Matt Chamberlain]], and [[Dave Abbruzzese]] are former members of the band.\n\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, [[Mother Love Bone]], Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', in 1991. One of the key bands in the [[grunge]] movement of the early 1990s, its members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or giving interviews. The band also sued [[Ticketmaster]], claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\"<ref name=\"secondcoming\">{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming | title = The Second Coming of Pearl Jam | work = Rolling Stone | date = June 16, 2006 | accessdate = June 22, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070528041642/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming |archivedate = May 28, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe band sold nearly 32{{nbsp}}million albums in the United States by 2012,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists | title = Top Selling Artists | accessdate = February 11, 2012 | work = [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]}}</ref> and by 2018, they had sold more than 85{{nbsp}}million albums worldwide.<ref name=\"Best Sellers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.seattlefoundation.org/Blog/Articles/2018/06/partnering-with-pearl-jams-home-shows|title=Partnering with Pearl Jam's Home Shows|publisher=SEATTLE FOUNDATION|date=June 18, 2018|accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref> Pearl Jam outsold many of its contemporary alternative rock bands from the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade.<ref>{{cite web | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r666816|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Lost Dogs'' Overview | work = Allmusic | accessdate = June 22, 2007}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] referred to Pearl Jam as \"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s\".<ref name=\"Erlewine\">{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5118|pure_url=yes}} | title = Pearl Jam > Biography | accessdate=June 22, 2007 | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | work =Allmusic}}</ref> Pearl Jam was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on April 7, 2017, in its first year of eligibility.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pearl-jam-joan-baez-lead-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-2017-class-w456839 |title=Pearl Jam, Joan Baez, Tupac Lead Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2017 Class |accessdate=December 20, 2016 |date=December 20, 2016 |first=Andy |last=Greene |work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> They were ranked at no. 8 in a reader poll by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in its \"Top Ten Live Acts of All Time\" issue.<ref name=\"PJ is life\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years (1984\u20131990)===\n[[Stone Gossard]] and [[Jeff Ament]] were members of pioneering grunge band [[Green River (band)|Green River]] during the mid-1980s.

In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the [[PolyGram]] record label, which signed the band in early 1989.

The band's lineup consists of founding members [[Jeff Ament]] (bass guitar), [[Stone Gossard]] (rhythm guitar), [[Mike McCready]] (lead guitar), and [[Eddie Vedder]] (lead vocals, guitar), as well as [[Matt Cameron]] (drums), who joined in 1998. Keyboardist [[Boom Gaspar]] has also been a touring/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers [[Jack Irons]], [[Dave Krusen]], [[Matt Chamberlain]], and [[Dave Abbruzzese]] are former members of the band.\n\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, [[Mother Love Bone]], Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', in 1991. One of the key bands in the [[grunge]] movement of the early 1990s, its members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or giving interviews. The band also sued [[Ticketmaster]], claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\"<ref name=\"secondcoming\">{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming | title = The Second Coming of Pearl Jam | work = Rolling Stone | date = June 16, 2006 | accessdate = June 22, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070528041642/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming |archivedate = May 28, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe band sold nearly 32{{nbsp}}million albums in the United States by 2012,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists | title = Top Selling Artists | accessdate = February 11, 2012 | work = [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]}}</ref> and by 2018, they had sold more than 85{{nbsp}}million albums worldwide.<ref name=\"Best Sellers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.seattlefoundation.org/Blog/Articles/2018/06/partnering-with-pearl-jams-home-shows|title=Partnering with Pearl Jam's Home Shows|publisher=SEATTLE FOUNDATION|date=June 18, 2018|accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref> Pearl Jam outsold many of its contemporary alternative rock bands from the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade.<ref>{{cite web | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r666816|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Lost Dogs'' Overview | work = Allmusic | accessdate = June 22, 2007}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] referred to Pearl Jam as \"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s\".<ref name=\"Erlewine\">{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5118|pure_url=yes}} | title = Pearl Jam > Biography | accessdate=June 22, 2007 | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | work =Allmusic}}</ref> Pearl Jam was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on April 7, 2017, in its first year of eligibility.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pearl-jam-joan-baez-lead-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-2017-class-w456839 |title=Pearl Jam, Joan Baez, Tupac Lead Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2017 Class |accessdate=December 20, 2016 |date=December 20, 2016 |first=Andy |last=Greene |work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> They were ranked at no. 8 in a reader poll by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in its \"Top Ten Live Acts of All Time\" issue.<ref name=\"PJ is life\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years (1984\u20131990)===\n[[Stone Gossard]] and [[Jeff Ament]] were members of pioneering grunge band [[Green River (band)|Green River]] during the mid-1980s.

The film is a [[sequel]] to the 2018 [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] ''[[Zombies (2018 film)|Zombies]]'', and stars [[Milo Manheim]] and [[Meg Donnelly]].\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn the earlier days of Seabrook, settlers fought off a group of werewolves from a moonstone that they have since kept hidden underground. In the present, time has passed since Seabrook and Zombietown settled their differences. Zed plans to ask Addison to the prawn, while Addison works to become the new cheer captain when Bucky steps down to become president. Due to a road incident caused by Zed's prawnposal, the bus carrying the cheerleaders crashes into the nearby forbidden forest; Addison and the cheer team see the werewolves. When they get back to Seabrook, the whole town freaks, and the mayor reinstates the anti-monster laws. This notably means that the zombies cannot go to prawn. Zed realizes if he runs for president, he can change things for both the zombies and werewolves.\n\nMeanwhile, the local werewolves are getting sick. They have moonstone necklaces which give them the werewolf abilities; without them, they can die. These moonstones are losing their power, so they need to find the moonstone in order to recharge their necklaces. Prophecy states that a girl with white hair, called the Great Alpha, will show them where this moonstone is. They begin to suspect Addison is the Great Alpha, so they enroll at Seabrook High to get closer to her, which Addison welcomes with open arms. As the werewolves are in Zombietown, Zed tries to rally the wolves to help him win the election, but they do not see the point of changing who they are to fit in. At cheer practice, the werewolves join in; as Zed and Eliza walk in, they suspect that Wyatt, one of the werewolves, has a thing for Addison, which makes Zed jealous. Addison follows Zed out into the hall, and they get into a little argument.\n\nThe werewolves eventually bring Addison to their den, where they tell her the prophecy, and Addison is excited to be a part of something spectacular. The werewolves give her a full charged moonstone necklace, which they have saved for the Great Alpha. If she puts it on and is truly a werewolf, she will transform into one; shortly thereafter, Zed, Bree, Eliza, and Bonzo find Addison in the wolf den after tracking her, thinking she was in trouble. Zed attempts to save Addison from the werewolves, but Addison tells him she wants to be there and that she has finally found her pack. Zed gets defensive and says that she does not want to be a monster and tells her not to put on the necklace. The werewolves agree to give her one day to decide. They feel an explosion, and it is said that they are destroying the power plant which created the zombies. Addison notes that the building is fueled by a mysterious energy source. If the power plant gets destroyed, it will crush and destroy the moonstone along with it. The next day, Addison shows Zed the necklace and tells him that she is going to put it on, and Zed tells her not to and discretely takes it when she is not looking. When Addison finds the werewolves, she realizes it is missing. Zed goes to his presidential debate against Bucky. He wins over the humans, but when the Z-band shorts out due to Addison's moonstone. Zed becomes a full zombie and everyone runs away screaming, which causes Zed to lose the election.\n\nMeanwhile, the werewolves head to Seabrook Power, where the alarm immediately goes off and the Zombie Patrol shows up. Addison and Bree also hear the alarm from school and realize that they need to help the werewolves. The werewolves get arrested at the demolition site when they release silver gas, their one weakness. Addison arrives with the cheerleaders and zombies, who get the adults to agree not to destroy the building. They all go outside to celebrate, when Zed reveals to Addison that he took the necklace from her. She gets mad at him and puts on the necklace, but finds out that she\u2019s not a werewolf. \nOne of the men in control of the device controlling the demolition shorts out and causes the whole building to be destroyed. The werewolves get very sick and retreat back to their den. Zed heads to the den to find them sick and dying, when he tells them that he is proud that they do not change who they are and they embrace that they are monsters.\n\nPrawn night arrives and Zed as well as the rest of the zombies and werewolves show up to crash the prawn. Everyone dances and Zed and Addison make up; however, the ground starts shaking and splits in half with a blue glow from the hole. The werewolves realize that the moonstone is not destroyed and go in the hole to find it; the humans and zombies follow to help. They find the moonstone. They try to get the moonstone out when a huge boulder blocks their exit. Zed removes his Z-band and uses his zombie strength to lift the boulder and allows the others to bring the moonstone out safely. They all go back to prawn and sing and dance and have fun, with Zed and Addison having their first kiss.\n\nLater, a blue glowing rock falls from the sky at night, causing a blue explosion. This causes Addison\u2019s radio to briefly short out; later, after waking up, her hair glows bright blue for a short moment.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Milo Manheim]] as Zed<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" />, a zombie.\n* [[Meg Donnelly]] as Addison<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" />, a white-haired teenage girl.\n* Trevor Tordjman as Bucky<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" />, Addison's self-centered cousin who leads the Seabrook High School's cheerleading team.\n* Kylee Russell as Eliza<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" />, a zombie who is friends with Zed.\n* Carla Jeffery as Bree, a cheerleader who is Addison's friend.\n* Chandler Kinney as Willa<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" />, the leader of the Forbidden Forest's werewolf pack.\n* Pearce Joza as Wyatt<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" />, a member of the Forbidden Forest's werewolf pack.\n* [[Ariel Martin]] as Wynter<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" />, the over-eager member of the Forbidden Forest's werewolf pack.\n* Kingston Foster as Zoey, Zed's younger sister\n* James Godfrey as Bonzo, a zombie who is friends with Zed and mostly speaks zombie language that has to be translated by Zed and/or Eliza.\n* [[Naomi Snieckus]] as Ms. Lee, the principal of Seabrook High School.\n* Jonathan Langdon as Coach, the unnamed coach of the Seabrook High School's football team who now started a froyo side-business.\n* [[Paul Hopkins (actor)|Paul Hopkins]] as Dale, Addison's father who is the Chief of the Zombie Patrol.\n* Megan Ward as Missy, Addison's mom who is the mayor of Seabrook.\n* [[Tony Nappo]] as Zevon, Zed and Zoey's father.\n* [[Emilia McCarthy]] as Lacey, a female cheerleader that is friends with Bucky and member of the Aceys.\n* Jasmine Renee Thomas as Stacey, a female cheerleader that is friends with Bucky and member of the Aceys.\n* Noah Zulfikar as J.C./Kevin, the latest member of the Aceys.\n\n== Production ==\nOn February 11, 2019, it was announced that a sequel went into production, with returning stars, director, and writers.

Thereby Islam is able to incorporate non-biblical[,] non-Quranic ideas about mythic images, that means: a. degrading deities to spirits and therefore taking into the spiritual world. b. taking daemons, not mentioned in the sacred traditions of Islam, of uncertain origin. c. consideration of spirits to tolerate or advising to regulate them.\" Original: \"M. Dols macht darauf aufmerksam, dass der Ginn-Glaube kein strikt islamisches Konzept ist. Er beinhaltet vielmehr zahllose Elemente einer G\u00f6tzenverehrung, wie sie Muhammads Gegner zur Zeit der ''gahiliyya'' in Mekka praktizierten. Gem\u00e4\u00df F. Meier integrierte der junge Islam bei seiner raschen Expansion viele heidnische Gottheiten in sein System, indem er sie zu D\u00e4monen degradierte. 1. Im Islam wird die Existenz von Geistern, die weder Engel noch unbedingt Teufel sein m\u00fcssen, anerkannt. 2. Damit besitzt der Islam die M\u00f6glichkeit, nicht-biblische[,] nicht koranische Vorstellungen von mythischen Vorstellungen sich einzuverleiben, d.h.: a.

If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn.

By that, a vast amount of traditions and beliefs among Muslims is excluded from contemporary theological discourse and downplaying embedded Muslim beliefs as local lore, such as symptoms of jinn possession.

It is a powerful account of their attempt to free themselves from a past viewed as inhabited by evil forces and about the encounter between contemporary Salafi reformism and a presumed disappearing religious universe. It serves to prove how a novel version of Islam has superseded former practices; delegitimized and categorized as belonging to the past. The story is, however, also an important source and an interesting entry-point to examine the continued relevance of past practices within processes of reform. Analyzing the story about the jinns and the trajectory of Salafi reform in Bale, this contribution demonstrates how the past remains intersected with present reformism, and how both former practices and novel impetuses are reconfigured through this process. The article pays attention to the dialectics of negotiations inherent to processes of reform and points to the manner in which the involvement of a range of different actors produces idiosyncratic results. It challenges notions of contemporary Islamic reform as something linear and fixed and argues that such processes are multifaceted and open-ended.\nSN  - 1872-0226\nUR  - https://doi.org/10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nDO  - 10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nID  - \u00d8steb\u00f82014\nER  - \n</ref> For that reason, jinn are taken as serious danger by adherents of Salafism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} [[Saudi Arabia]], following the [[Wahhabism]] strant of Salafism, imposes a [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|death penalty]] for dealing with jinn to prevent [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]] and [[witchcraft]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/08/the-death-penalty-in-saudi-arabia-facts-and-figures/ | title=The death penalty in Saudi Arabia: Facts and Figures}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/saudi-arabias-war-on-witchcraft/278701/ | title=Saudi Arabia's War on Witchcraft| date=2013-08-19}}</ref> Contrary to the official teachings of modern Islam, cultural beliefs about jinn remained popular among Muslim societies and their understanding of cosmology and anthropology.<ref>PEDRAM PARTOVI\n ''Girls\u2019 Dormitor y : Women\u2019s Islam and Iranian Horror\n''</ref>\n\n[[Ahmadi]] interpret jinn not as supernatural beings, but as powerful men whose influence is felt even though they keep their distance from the common people.

Dols points out that jinn-belief is not a strictly Islamic concept. It rather includes countless elements of idol-worship, as Muhammad's enemies practised in Mecca during ''jahilliya''. According to F. Meier early Islam integrated many pagan deities into its system by degrading them to spirits. 1. In Islam, the existence of spirits that are neither angels nor necessarily devils is acknowledged. 2. Thereby Islam is able to incorporate non-biblical[,] non-Quranic ideas about mythic images, that means: a. degrading deities to spirits and therefore taking into the spiritual world. b. taking daemons, not mentioned in the sacred traditions of Islam, of uncertain origin. c. consideration of spirits to tolerate or advising to regulate them.\" Original: \"M.

Additionally, they fear iron, generally appear in desolate or abandoned places, and are stronger and faster than humans.<ref name=\"Hughes-1885-134-6\"/> Since the jinn share the earth with humans, Muslims are often cautious not to accidentally hurt an innocent jinn by uttering \"destur\" (permission), before sprinkling hot water.<ref name=\"Hughes-1885-134-6\"/><ref>MacDonald, D.B., Mass\u00e9, H., Boratav, P.N., Nizami, K.A. and Voorhoeve, P., \u201c\u1e0ej\u0332inn\u201d, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P.

Jahiz states in his work [[Kitab al-Hayawan]] that loneliness induces humans to mind-games and wishful thinking, causing ''wasw\u0101s'' (whisperings in the mind, traditionally thought to be caused by [[Satan]]). If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn.

It is a powerful account of their attempt to free themselves from a past viewed as inhabited by evil forces and about the encounter between contemporary Salafi reformism and a presumed disappearing religious universe. It serves to prove how a novel version of Islam has superseded former practices; delegitimized and categorized as belonging to the past. The story is, however, also an important source and an interesting entry-point to examine the continued relevance of past practices within processes of reform. Analyzing the story about the jinns and the trajectory of Salafi reform in Bale, this contribution demonstrates how the past remains intersected with present reformism, and how both former practices and novel impetuses are reconfigured through this process. The article pays attention to the dialectics of negotiations inherent to processes of reform and points to the manner in which the involvement of a range of different actors produces idiosyncratic results. It challenges notions of contemporary Islamic reform as something linear and fixed and argues that such processes are multifaceted and open-ended.\nSN  - 1872-0226\nUR  - https://doi.org/10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nDO  - 10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nID  - \u00d8steb\u00f82014\nER  - \n</ref> For that reason, jinn are taken as serious danger by adherents of Salafism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} [[Saudi Arabia]], following the [[Wahhabism]] strant of Salafism, imposes a [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|death penalty]] for dealing with jinn to prevent [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]] and [[witchcraft]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/08/the-death-penalty-in-saudi-arabia-facts-and-figures/ | title=The death penalty in Saudi Arabia: Facts and Figures}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/saudi-arabias-war-on-witchcraft/278701/ | title=Saudi Arabia's War on Witchcraft| date=2013-08-19}}</ref> Contrary to the official teachings of modern Islam, cultural beliefs about jinn remained popular among Muslim societies and their understanding of cosmology and anthropology.<ref>PEDRAM PARTOVI\n ''Girls\u2019 Dormitor y : Women\u2019s Islam and Iranian Horror\n''</ref>\n\n[[Ahmadi]] interpret jinn not as supernatural beings, but as powerful men whose influence is felt even though they keep their distance from the common people.

The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its musical scope and the social relevance of Lamar's lyrics. It was ranked as the best album of 2015 by many publications, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''. It was also ranked by many publications as one of the best albums of the 2010s (decade), with ''[[The Independent]]'' placing it first. The album was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[58th Annual Grammy Awards|58th Grammy Awards]], winning the latter. The album was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

Lamar takes his opinions further to lend his position on black crime in the song \"[[The Blacker the Berry (song)|The Blacker the Berry]]\". He criticizes himself and his community by rapping, \"So why did I weep when [[Trayvon Martin]] was in the street? / When gang bangin' make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\". Some critics claim that his attitude facilitates the rhetoric that silences the Black Lives Matter movement. Stereo Williams of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote in response to his lyrics that \"it's dangerous to use that violence as a silencing tactic when the public is angry about the systematic subjugation of black people.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/11/who-exactly-is-kendrick-lamar-raging-against-in-the-blacker-the-berry.html|title=Who Exactly Is Kendrick Lamar Raging Against in 'Blacker the Berry?'|last=Williams|first=Stereo|date=February 11, 2015|newspaper=The Daily Beast|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\n''To Pimp a Butterfly'' was recorded at a variety of studios; including [[Chalice Recording Studios]], [[Downtown (company)|Downtown Studios]], House Studios, Notifi Studios and No Excuses Studios.

It was released on March 15, 2015, by [[Top Dawg Entertainment]], distributed by [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Interscope Records]]. \n\nThe album was recorded in studios throughout the United States, with production from [[Sounwave]], [[Terrace Martin]], [[Sa-Ra|Taz \"Tisa\" Arnold]], [[Thundercat (musician)|Thundercat]], [[Rahki]], LoveDragon, [[Flying Lotus]], [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Boi-1da]], [[Knxwledge]], and several other high-profile [[hip hop production|hip hop producers]], as well as executive production from [[Dr. Dre]] and Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith. The album incorporates elements of [[jazz]], [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[spoken word]], and [[avant-garde music]] and explores a variety of political and personal themes concerning [[African-American culture]], [[racial inequality]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[discrimination|institutional discrimination]].\n\n''To Pimp a Butterfly'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 363,000 copies in its first week. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its musical scope and the social relevance of Lamar's lyrics. It was ranked as the best album of 2015 by many publications, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''. It was also ranked by many publications as one of the best albums of the 2010s (decade), with ''[[The Independent]]'' placing it first. The album was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[58th Annual Grammy Awards|58th Grammy Awards]], winning the latter. The album was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). By June 2017, the album had sold one million copies in the United States. \n\nThe album was supported by five singles\u2014\"[[i (Kendrick Lamar song)|i]]\", \"[[The Blacker the Berry (song)|The Blacker the Berry]]\", \"[[King Kunta]]\", \"[[Alright (Kendrick Lamar song)|Alright]]\" and \"[[These Walls (Kendrick Lamar song)|These Walls]]\".

Releasing his album in a time of renewed black activism, Lamar's song \"[[Alright (Kendrick Lamar song)|Alright]]\" has become a rallying cry for the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.<ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/08/black_lives_matter_protesters_chant_kendrick_lamar_s_alright_what_makes.html|title=Is Kendrick Lamar's \"Alright\" the New Black National Anthem?|last=Harris|first=Aisha|date=August 3, 2015|work=Slate|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref> With lyrics like \"and we hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho, nigga\" he makes it clear that he is supportive of the movement and the families of black men and women like [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]], [[Death of Sandra Bland|Sandra Bland]], [[Shooting of Tamir Rice|Tamir Rice]], and others who have fallen victim to [[Extrajudicial killing|police brutality]] in the United States. Lamar takes his opinions further to lend his position on black crime in the song \"[[The Blacker the Berry (song)|The Blacker the Berry]]\". He criticizes himself and his community by rapping, \"So why did I weep when [[Trayvon Martin]] was in the street? / When gang bangin' make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\". Some critics claim that his attitude facilitates the rhetoric that silences the Black Lives Matter movement. Stereo Williams of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote in response to his lyrics that \"it's dangerous to use that violence as a silencing tactic when the public is angry about the systematic subjugation of black people.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/11/who-exactly-is-kendrick-lamar-raging-against-in-the-blacker-the-berry.html|title=Who Exactly Is Kendrick Lamar Raging Against in 'Blacker the Berry?'|last=Williams|first=Stereo|date=February 11, 2015|newspaper=The Daily Beast|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\n''To Pimp a Butterfly'' was recorded at a variety of studios; including [[Chalice Recording Studios]], [[Downtown (company)|Downtown Studios]], House Studios, Notifi Studios and No Excuses Studios.
