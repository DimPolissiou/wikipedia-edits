{"title_page": "Ghent system", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=August 2016}}\nThe '''Ghent system''' is the name given to an arrangement in some countries whereby the main responsibility for [[welfare]] payments, especially [[unemployment benefits]], is held by [[trade union|trade/labor unions]], rather than a [[government agency]].\n\nThe system is named after the city of [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]], where it was first implemented. It is the predominant form of unemployment benefit in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Sweden]]. Belgium has a hybrid or \"quasi-Ghent\" system, in which the government also plays a significant role in distributing benefits. In all of the above countries, unemployment funds held by unions or labour federations are regulated and/or partly [[subsidy|subsidised]] by the national government concerned.\n\nBecause workers in many cases need to belong to a union to receive benefits, union membership is higher in countries with the Ghent system. Furthermore, the state benefit is a fixed sum, but the benefits from unemployment funds depend on previous earnings.\n\n== The Ghent system in Sweden ==\nFrom January 2007, the Swedish state decreased its financial support to the unemployment funds (most of them union-run, a few funds aimed for small entrepreneurs and one independent fund), with the result being that membership fees to unemployment funds had to be raised considerably, and union density declined from 77% in 2006 to 71% in 2008.<ref>Anders Kjellberg (2011) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/3462138/2064087.pdf \"The Decline in Swedish Union Density since 2007\"] ''Nordic Journal of Working Life Studies'' (NJWLS) Vol. 1.

It is the predominant form of unemployment benefit in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Sweden]]. Belgium has a hybrid or \"quasi-Ghent\" system, in which the government also plays a significant role in distributing benefits. In all of the above countries, unemployment funds held by unions or labour federations are regulated and/or partly [[subsidy|subsidised]] by the national government concerned.\n\nBecause workers in many cases need to belong to a union to receive benefits, union membership is higher in countries with the Ghent system. Furthermore, the state benefit is a fixed sum, but the benefits from unemployment funds depend on previous earnings.\n\n== The Ghent system in Sweden ==\nFrom January 2007, the Swedish state decreased its financial support to the unemployment funds (most of them union-run, a few funds aimed for small entrepreneurs and one independent fund), with the result being that membership fees to unemployment funds had to be raised considerably, and union density declined from 77% in 2006 to 71% in 2008.<ref>Anders Kjellberg (2011) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/3462138/2064087.pdf \"The Decline in Swedish Union Density since 2007\"] ''Nordic Journal of Working Life Studies'' (NJWLS) Vol. 1.

For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer [[Tr\u00e9 Cool]], who replaced [[John Kiffmeyer]] in 1990 prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1991). Touring guitarist [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016.\n\nGreen Day was originally part of the [[Punk rock#1979\u20131984: Schism and diversification|late 80s-early 90s punk scene]] at the DIY [[924 Gilman Street]] club in [[Berkeley, California]]. The band's early releases were with the independent record label [[Lookout! Records]]. In 1994, their major label debut ''[[Dookie]]'', released through [[Reprise Records]], became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands [[NOFX]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[Bad Religion]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.\n\nThough the albums ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' (1995), ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'' (1997), and ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' (2000) did not match the success of ''Dookie'', they were still successful with the former two reaching triple platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a [[rock opera]] called ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ''[[\u00a1Uno!]]'', ''[[\u00a1Dos!]]'', and ''[[\u00a1Tr\u00e9!]]'', released in September, November, and December 2012 respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and lead singer and guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] going into rehab. Their twelfth studio album, ''[[Revolution Radio]]'', was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Father of All Motherfuckers]]'', was released on February 7, 2020.\n\nGreen Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/09/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nominees-green-day-nine-inch-nails-lou-reed/16852249/|title=Green Day, Nine Inch Nails among Rock Hall nominees|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 9, 2014|accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref> The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with [[Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] for ''[[Dookie]]'', [[Best Rock Album]] for ''[[American Idiot]]'' and ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', [[Record of the Year]] for \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\", and [[Best Musical Show Album]] for ''[[American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording]]''.\n\nIn 2010, a [[American Idiot (musical)|stage adaptation of ''American Idiot'']] debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]]: [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]], and [[Tony Award for Best Lighting Design|Best Lighting Design]], winning the latter two.

For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer [[Tr\u00e9 Cool]], who replaced [[John Kiffmeyer]] in 1990 prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1991). Touring guitarist [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016.\n\nGreen Day was originally part of the [[Punk rock#1979\u20131984: Schism and diversification|late 80s-early 90s punk scene]] at the DIY [[924 Gilman Street]] club in [[Berkeley, California]]. The band's early releases were with the independent record label [[Lookout! Records]]. In 1994, their major label debut ''[[Dookie]]'', released through [[Reprise Records]], became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands [[NOFX]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[Bad Religion]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.\n\nThough the albums ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' (1995), ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'' (1997), and ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' (2000) did not match the success of ''Dookie'', they were still successful with the former two reaching triple platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a [[rock opera]] called ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ''[[\u00a1Uno!]]'', ''[[\u00a1Dos!]]'', and ''[[\u00a1Tr\u00e9!]]'', released in September, November, and December 2012 respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and lead singer and guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] going into rehab. Their twelfth studio album, ''[[Revolution Radio]]'', was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Father of All Motherfuckers]]'', was released on February 7, 2020.\n\nGreen Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/09/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nominees-green-day-nine-inch-nails-lou-reed/16852249/|title=Green Day, Nine Inch Nails among Rock Hall nominees|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 9, 2014|accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref> The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with [[Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] for ''[[Dookie]]'', [[Best Rock Album]] for ''[[American Idiot]]'' and ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', [[Record of the Year]] for \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\", and [[Best Musical Show Album]] for ''[[American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording]]''.\n\nIn 2010, a [[American Idiot (musical)|stage adaptation of ''American Idiot'']] debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]]: [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]], and [[Tony Award for Best Lighting Design|Best Lighting Design]], winning the latter two.

The name means 'buffalo lizard', in a combination of [[Blackfoot language|Blackfeet]] Indian ''eini'' and Latinized [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros''; the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] (''procurvicornis'') means 'with a forward-curving horn' in [[Latin]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n===The Landslide Butte expeditions===\n''Einiosaurus'' is an exclusively Montanan [[dinosaur]], and all of its known remains are currently held at the [[Museum of the Rockies]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]]. At least fifteen individuals of varying ages are represented by three adult skulls and hundreds of other bones from two low-diversity, monospecific (one species) bonebeds, which were discovered by [[John R. Horner|Jack Horner]] in 1985 and excavated from 1985 to 1989 by Museum of the Rockies field crews. \n[[File:Jack Horner.jpg|left|thumb|Jack Horner]]\nHorner had not been searching for horned dinosaurs. In the spring of 1985 he had been informed by landowner Jim Peebles that he would no longer be allowed access to the Willow Creek \"Egg Mountain\" site where during six years a nesting colony of ''[[Maiasaura]]'' had been excavated.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=57}} This forced Horner to find an alternative site because supplies had already been bought for a new summer season and fourteen volunteers and students expected to be employed by him.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=57}} He investigated two sites, Devil's Pocket and Red Rocks, that however proved to contain too few fossils.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|pp=58-60}} For some years, since 1982, Horner had requested from the Blackfeet Indian Tribal Council access to the Landslide Butte site. The field notes of [[Charles Whitney Gilmore]] from the 1920s indicated that dinosaur eggs could be found there. The council had consistently turned down his requests because they feared widespread disturbance of the reservation. However, one of its members, Marvin Weatherwax, had earlier in 1985 observed that an excavation by Horner of a [[Mosasauridae|mosasaurid]] in the Four Horns Lake had caused only limited damage to the landscape. In early July, the council granted Horner access to the entire reservation.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=61}}\n\nEarly in August, Horner's associate Bob Makela discovered the Dino Ridge Quarry, containing extensive ceratopid remains, on the land of farmer Ricky Reagan.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=64}} Continual rainfall hampered operations that year.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=65}} On 20 June 1986, a crew of sixteen returned to reopen the quarry.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=65}} A large and dense concentration of bones, a bonebed, was excavated, with up to forty bones per square metre being present. This was interpreted as representing an entire herd that had perished.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|pp=66-67}} In late August 1986, Horner and preparator Carrie Ancell on the land of Gloria Sundquist discovered a second horned dinosaur site, at one mile distance from the first, called the Canyon Bone Bed, in which two relatively complete skulls were dug up.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|pp=73-74}} The skulls had to be removed from a rather steep cliff and weighed about half a tonne when plastered. They were airlifted by a [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] of the [[United States Army National Guard]] into trucks to be transported.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=75}} The aberrant build of these skulls first suggested to Horner that they might represent an unknown taxon.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=74}} Unexpectedly benefiting from a grant of $204,000 by the [[MacArthur Fellows Program]],{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=79}} Horner was able to reopen the two bonebed quarries in 1987.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=80}} That year almost all fossils were removed that could be accessed without using mechanised earth-moving equipment.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=84}} Also, an additional horned dinosaur skull was excavated from a somewhat younger layer.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=82}} In 1988, more ceratopid material was found in a more southern site, the Blacktail Creek North.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|pp=96-97}} In the second week of June 1989, student [[Scott D. Sampson|Scott Donald Sampson]] in the context of his doctoral research with a small crew reopened the Canyon Bone Bed, while [[Patrick Leiggi]] that summer with a limited number of workers restarted excavating the Dino Ridge Quarry.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=103}} The same year, Horner himself found more horned dinosaur fossils at the Blacktail Creek North.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=104}} In 1990, the expeditions were ended because the reservation allowed access to commercial fossil hunters who quickly strip-mined sites with bulldozers, through a lack of proper documentation greatly diminishing the scientific value of the discoveries.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|pp=110-111}}\n\n===Identification problems===\nAt the time of the expeditions, it was assumed that all horned dinosaur fossils found in the reservation belonged to a single species, especially as they came from a limited geological time period, its duration estimated at about half a million years.<ref name=\"Dodson1996\"/> In the 1920s, [[George F. Sternberg|George Freyer Sternberg]] had already found ceratopid bones there, that were named as a second species of ''[[Styracosaurus]]'': ''Styracosaurus ovatus''.<ref name=\"Dodson1996\"/> The material had been rather limited and the validity of this species had been doubted, some considering it a ''[[nomen dubium]]''.<ref>Dodson, P.; Forster, C.A.; Sampson, S.D., 2004, \"Ceratopsidae\", in: Weishampel, D.B.; Dodson, P.; Osm\u00f3lska, H., ''The Dinosauria, Second Edition'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 494\u2013513</ref> The abundant new remains seemed to prove that the species was real, also because it clearly differed from the type species of ''Styracosaurus'', ''[[Styracosaurus albertensis]]''.<ref name=\"Dodson1996\">{{cite book | last1 = Dodson | first1 =  P. |year= 1996 | pages = 193\u2013197|title= The Horned Dinosaurs: a Natural History |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn= 978-0691628950|location=Princeton, New Jersey}}</ref> The comprehensive taphonomic study by [[Raymond R. Rogers|Raymond Robert Rogers]] from 1990 however, did not commit itself fully to this identification, merely mentioning a ''Styracosaurus'' sp.<ref name=rogers1990/> Rogers had joined the expedition in 1987.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=85}} This reflected the fact that the expedition members had started to take the possibility into account that the species was completely new to science, informally referring to it as \"Styracosaurus makeli\" in honour of Bob Makela, who had died in a traffic accident in June 1987.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|pp=80\u201381}} In 1990, this name, as an invalid ''[[nomen nudum]]'' because it lacked a description, appeared in a photo caption in a book by Stephen Czerkas.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Czerkas | first1 = S.

He had less affinity for other kinds of dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Dodson1996\"/> In 1987 and 1989, to resolve the ''Styracosaurus'' question, horned dinosaur specialist [[Peter Dodson]] was invited to investigate the new [[ceratopsian]] finds.<ref name=\"Dodson1996\"/> In 1990, the fossil material was seen by Dodson as strengthening the case for the validity of a separate ''Styracosaurus ovatus'', to be distinguished from ''Styracosaurus albertensis''.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Dodson | first1 = P. | last2 = Currie | first2 = P.

While still thinking that a single population of horned dinosaurs had been present, he began to see it as a [[chronospecies]], an evolutionary series of [[taxon|taxa]]. In 1992, he described them in an article as three \"[[transitional taxa]]\" that had spanned the gap between the older ''Styracosaurus'' and the later ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]''. He deliberately declined to name these three taxa. The oldest form was indicated as \"Transitional Taxon A\", mainly represented by skull MOR 492. Then came \"Taxon B\" \u2013 the many skeletons of the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and the Canyon Bone Bed. The youngest was \"Taxon C\", represented by skull MOR 485 found in 1987 and the horned dinosaur fossils of the Blacktail Creek North.<ref name=\"Horner1992\">{{cite journal|last1=Horner|first1=J.

Although an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] was published containing a sufficient description, making the name valid, it did not yet identify by inventory number a [[holotype]], a name-bearing specimen. The same abstract named Type C as ''[[Achelousaurus|Achelousaurus horneri]]''.<ref>Sampson, S. D. 1994. \"Two new horned dinosaurs (Ornithischia: Ceratopsidae) from the Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation, Montana, USA\". ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'' '''14'''(3, supplement): 44A</ref> In 1995, Sampson published a larger article, indicating the holotype. The generic name ''Einiosaurus'' is derived from the Blackfeet ''eini'', \"[[American bison]]\", and Latinised Greek ''saurus'', \"lizard\". The name was chosen to honour the Blackfeet tribe but also to reflect the fact that ceratopids were, in Sampson's words, \"the buffalo of the Cretaceous\", living in herds and having a complex life. According to Sampson, the name should be pronounced as \"eye-knee-o-saurus\". The specific name is derived from [[Latin]] ''procurvus'', \"bent forwards\", and ''cornu'', \"horn\", referring to the forwards curving nasal horn.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nThe [[holotype]], '''MOR 456-8-9-6-1''', was found in a layer of the [[Two Medicine Formation]] dating from the late [[Campanian]]. It consists of a partial skull, including the nasal horn, the supraorbital area and part of the [[parietal bone]] of the skull frill. The skull represents an adult individual. Sampson referred many other specimens to the species. He indicated that additional fossil material from the Canyon Bone Bed had been subsumed under the inventory number MOR 456. This included two further adult skulls and single cranial and postcranial bones from individuals of varying age classes. Furthermore, the fossils from the Dino Ridge Quarry were referred. They had been catalogued within number MOR 373. They consisted of about two hundred non-articulated bones, again from animals of different ages.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nIn 2010, Paul renamed ''E. procurvicornis'' into ''Centrosaurus procurvicornis'',<ref name=\"Paul2010\"/> but this has found no acceptance, subsequent research invariably referring to the taxon as ''Einiosaurus''.\n\n==Description==\n===Size and distinguishing traits===\n[[File:Einiosaurus Scale.svg|thumb|Size comparison with human]]\n''Einiosaurus'' was a herbivorous dinosaur. It is generally as large as ''Achelousaurus'', though far less robust.<ref name=sampson1995 /> In 2010, [[Gregory S. Paul]] estimated the body length of ''Einiosaurus'' at 4.5 meters, its weight at 1.3 tonnes.<ref name=\"Paul2010\">Paul, G.S., 2010, ''The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs'', Princeton University Press p. 262</ref> Both taxa fall within the typical size range of the [[Centrosaurinae]].<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\n[[File:Einiosaurus BW.jpg|thumb|Restoration]]\nIn 1995, Sampson indicated several distinguishing traits. The nasal horn has a base that is long from front to rear, is transversely flattened, and is strongly curved forwards in some adult specimens. The supraorbital \"brow\" horns as far as they are present are low and rounded with a convex surface on the inner side. The parietal parts of the rear edge of the skull frill together bear a single pair of large curved spikes sticking out to behind.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\n''Einiosaurus'' differs from all other known Centrosaurinae by a longer-based and more procurved nasal horn and by a supraorbital horn that is longer-based and more rounded in side view. It differs from ''Achelousaurus'' in particular in having large parietal spikes that are not directed sideways to some extent.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nAs a centrosaurine, ''Einiosaurus'' walked on all fours, had a large head with a beak, a moderately large skull frill, a short powerful neck, heavily muscled forelimbs, a high torso, powerful hindlimbs and a relatively short tail.\n\n===Skeleton===\nIn 1995, Sampson only described the skull, not the postcrania, the parts behind the skull. This was motivated by the fact that in centrosaurines the postcranial skeleton is \"conservative\", i.e. differs only slightly among species. Sampson could not find traits in which ''Einiosaurus'' differed from a generalised centrosaurine.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\n[[File:Nasals of Einiosaurus.jpg|thumb|Nasal bones of younger individuals in the top row and older individuals in the bottom row]] \nThe holotype skull is the largest known and has a total length of 156 centimetres. The snout is relatively narrow and pointed. The top of the snout is formed by the paired [[nasal bone]]s. Their top surfaces together bear the core of the nasal horn. In 1995, apart from the skulls eight nasal horns from both bonebeds were referred to ''Einiosaurus''. Two of these were from subadults. These show how the horn developed during the growth of the animal. The initially separated core halves fused from the tip downwards and joined into a single structure on the midline. In the subadult stage, the core still showed a suture, however. The subadult cores were transversely flattened and relatively small, not higher than twelve centimetres. Six cores were of adults. They showed two distinctive types. Two cores were small and erect, i.e. vertically directed. The four others were large and procurved, strongly curving to the front. The adult hornes resembled the subadult ones in being transversely compressed and having a long base from front to rear. To behind they nearly reached the [[frontal bone]]s.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nSampson compared the nasal horn of ''Einiosaurus'' with the horns of two related species, ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' and ''Styracosaurus''. From large bonebeds, numerous nasal horns of ''Centrosaurus'' are known, presenting a considerable range of morphologies. Despite all this variation, ''Einiosaurus'' horns can be clearly distinguished from them. They are more laterally compressed, unlike the more oval cross-section of ''Centrosaurus'' horns. The adult horns are also much more procurved than any nasal horn found in ''Centrosaurus'' beds. ''Styracosaurus'' horncores are much longer than those of ''Einiosaurus'', up to half a metre in length, and erect or slightly recurved to the rear.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nApart from a horn on the snout, centrosaurines also had horns above the eye sockets, supraorbital horncores. These cores were formed by a fusion of the [[postorbital bone]] with the much smaller [[palpebral bone]] in front of it. Nine subadult or adult \"brow horns\" were found. They all shared the same build in being low, long and rounded. This differs from the usual pointed horns with an oval base seen in typical centrosaurines. It is also unlike the supraorbital bosses seen in ''Achelousaurus'' and ''Pachyrhinosaurus''. Nevertheless, some ''Einiosaurus'' horns seemed to approach bosses. Three older individuals featured a total of five instances in which the horn as such was replaced by a low rounded mass, sometimes with a large pit in the usual location of the horn point. The large holotype has a rounded mass above the left eye socket but a pit, eighty-five millimetres long and sixty-four millimetres wide, on the right side. According to Sampson, this reflects a general trend with centrosaurines to re-absorb the brow horns in later life. All known specimens of ''Styracosaurus'' e.g. have a pitted region instead of true horns. The ''Einiosaurus'' holotype additionally has a rough bone mass at the rear postorbital region on the left side.<ref name=sampson1995 /> In all centrosaurines, the frontal bones re folded in such a way that a \"double\" roof is formed with a \"supracranial cavity\" in between. A [[fontanelle]] pierces the upper layer. In ''Einiosaurus'', this cavity runs sideways, continuing to below into the brow horn. With ''Centrosaurus'' and ''Styracosaurus'' these passages are more narrow and do not reach the horns but ''Pachyrhinosaurus'' shows a comparable extension. Sampson in 1995 also expounded his general views on such skull roofs, which are not easy to interpret due to fusion. According to him, the frontal bones always extended to the parietals, so that the paired postorbitals never contacted. The parietal bone made only a small contribution to the fontanelle. The floor of the cavity is, at the frontal-parietal suture, pierced by a large foramen into the braincase, the function of this \"pineal opening\" being unknown.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nIts snout is narrow and very pointed. It is typically portrayed with a low, strongly forward and downward curving nasal horn that resembles a bottle opener, though this may only occur in some adults. The supraorbital (over-the-eye) horns are low, short and triangular in top view if present at all, as opposed to the [[chasmosaurines]], such as ''[[Triceratops]]'', which have prominent supraorbital horns. A pair of large spikes, the third epiparietals, projects backwards from the relatively small frill. Smaller [[osteoderms]] adorn the frill edge. The first epiparietals are largely absent.\n\n==Classification==\nThe placement of ''Einiosaurus'' within [[Centrosaurinae]] is problematic due to the transitional nature of several of its skull characters, and its closest relatives are either ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' and ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' or ''[[Achelousaurus]]'' and ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]''. The latter hypothesis is supported by Horner and colleagues, where ''Einiosaurus'' is the earliest of an evolutionary series in which the nasal horns gradually change to rough bosses, as in ''Achelousaurus'' and ''Pachyrhinosaurus'' which are the second and third in this series.

This is evidence that ''Einiosaurus'', as well as other centrosaurine ceratopsians such as ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]'' and ''[[Centrosaurus]]'', were herding animals similar in behavior to modern-day [[bison]] or [[wildebeest]]. In contrast, ceratopsine ceratopsids, such as ''[[Triceratops]]'' and ''[[Torosaurus]]'', are typically found singly, implying that they may have been somewhat solitary in life, though fossilized footprints may provide evidence to the contrary.<ref name=rogers1990 /> In 2010, a study by [[Julie Reizner]] of the individuals excavated at the Dino Ridge site concluded that ''Einiosaurus'' grew quickly until its third to fifth year of life after which growth slowed, probably at the onset of sexual maturity.<ref>Reizner, J., 2010, ''An ontogenetic series and population histology of the ceratopsid dinosaur ''Einiosaurus procurvicornis''.''

The name means 'buffalo lizard', in a combination of [[Blackfoot language|Blackfeet]] Indian ''eini'' and Latinized [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros''; the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] (''procurvicornis'') means 'with a forward-curving horn' in [[Latin]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n===The Landslide Butte expeditions===\n''Einiosaurus'' is an exclusively Montanan [[dinosaur]], and all of its known remains are currently held at the [[Museum of the Rockies]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]]. At least fifteen individuals of varying ages are represented by three adult skulls and hundreds of other bones from two low-diversity, monospecific (one species) bonebeds, which were discovered by [[John R. Horner|Jack Horner]] in 1985 and excavated from 1985 to 1989 by Museum of the Rockies field crews. \n[[File:Jack Horner.jpg|left|thumb|Jack Horner]]\nHorner had not been searching for horned dinosaurs. In the spring of 1985 he had been informed by landowner Jim Peebles that he would no longer be allowed access to the Willow Creek \"Egg Mountain\" site where during six years a nesting colony of ''[[Maiasaura]]'' had been excavated.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=57}} This forced Horner to find an alternative site because supplies had already been bought for a new summer season and fourteen volunteers and students expected to be employed by him.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=57}} He investigated two sites, Devil's Pocket and Red Rocks, that however proved to contain too few fossils.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|pp=58-60}} For some years, since 1982, Horner had requested from the Blackfeet Indian Tribal Council access to the Landslide Butte site. The field notes of [[Charles Whitney Gilmore]] from the 1920s indicated that dinosaur eggs could be found there. The council had consistently turned down his requests because they feared widespread disturbance of the reservation. However, one of its members, Marvin Weatherwax, had earlier in 1985 observed that an excavation by Horner of a [[Mosasauridae|mosasaurid]] in the Four Horns Lake had caused only limited damage to the landscape. In early July, the council granted Horner access to the entire reservation.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=61}}\n\nEarly in August, Horner's associate Bob Makela discovered the Dino Ridge Quarry, containing extensive ceratopid remains, on the land of farmer Ricky Reagan.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=64}} Continual rainfall hampered operations that year.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=65}} On 20 June 1986, a crew of sixteen returned to reopen the quarry.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=65}} A large and dense concentration of bones, a bonebed, was excavated, with up to forty bones per square metre being present. This was interpreted as representing an entire herd that had perished.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|pp=66-67}} In late August 1986, Horner and preparator Carrie Ancell on the land of Gloria Sundquist discovered a second horned dinosaur site, at one mile distance from the first, called the Canyon Bone Bed, in which two relatively complete skulls were dug up.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|pp=73-74}} The skulls had to be removed from a rather steep cliff and weighed about half a tonne when plastered. They were airlifted by a [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] of the [[United States Army National Guard]] into trucks to be transported.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=75}} The aberrant build of these skulls first suggested to Horner that they might represent an unknown taxon.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=74}} Unexpectedly benefiting from a grant of $204,000 by the [[MacArthur Fellows Program]],{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=79}} Horner was able to reopen the two bonebed quarries in 1987.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=80}} That year almost all fossils were removed that could be accessed without using mechanised earth-moving equipment.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=84}} Also, an additional horned dinosaur skull was excavated from a somewhat younger layer.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=82}} In 1988, more ceratopid material was found in a more southern site, the Blacktail Creek North.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|pp=96-97}} In the second week of June 1989, student [[Scott D. Sampson|Scott Donald Sampson]] in the context of his doctoral research with a small crew reopened the Canyon Bone Bed, while [[Patrick Leiggi]] that summer with a limited number of workers restarted excavating the Dino Ridge Quarry.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=103}} The same year, Horner himself found more horned dinosaur fossils at the Blacktail Creek North.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|p=104}} In 1990, the expeditions were ended because the reservation allowed access to commercial fossil hunters who quickly strip-mined sites with bulldozers, through a lack of proper documentation greatly diminishing the scientific value of the discoveries.{{Sfn|Horner|Dobb|1997|pp=110-111}}\n\n===Identification problems===\nAt the time of the expeditions, it was assumed that all horned dinosaur fossils found in the reservation belonged to a single species, especially as they came from a limited geological time period, its duration estimated at about half a million years.<ref name=\"Dodson1996\"/> In the 1920s, [[George F. Sternberg|George Freyer Sternberg]] had already found ceratopid bones there, that were named as a second species of ''[[Styracosaurus]]'': ''Styracosaurus ovatus''.<ref name=\"Dodson1996\"/> The material had been rather limited and the validity of this species had been doubted, some considering it a ''[[nomen dubium]]''.<ref>Dodson, P.; Forster, C.A.; Sampson, S.D., 2004, \"Ceratopsidae\", in: Weishampel, D.B.; Dodson, P.; Osm\u00f3lska, H., ''The Dinosauria, Second Edition'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 494\u2013513</ref> The abundant new remains seemed to prove that the species was real, also because it clearly differed from the type species of ''Styracosaurus'', ''[[Styracosaurus albertensis]]''.<ref name=\"Dodson1996\">{{cite book | last1 = Dodson | first1 =  P. |year= 1996 | pages = 193\u2013197|title= The Horned Dinosaurs: a Natural History |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn= 978-0691628950|location=Princeton, New Jersey}}</ref> The comprehensive taphonomic study by [[Raymond R.

While still thinking that a single population of horned dinosaurs had been present, he began to see it as a [[chronospecies]], an evolutionary series of [[taxon|taxa]]. In 1992, he described them in an article as three \"[[transitional taxa]]\" that had spanned the gap between the older ''Styracosaurus'' and the later ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]''. He deliberately declined to name these three taxa. The oldest form was indicated as \"Transitional Taxon A\", mainly represented by skull MOR 492. Then came \"Taxon B\" \u2013 the many skeletons of the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and the Canyon Bone Bed. The youngest was \"Taxon C\", represented by skull MOR 485 found in 1987 and the horned dinosaur fossils of the Blacktail Creek North.<ref name=\"Horner1992\">{{cite journal|last1=Horner|first1=J.

Although an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] was published containing a sufficient description, making the name valid, it did not yet identify by inventory number a [[holotype]], a name-bearing specimen. The same abstract named Type C as ''[[Achelousaurus|Achelousaurus horneri]]''.<ref>Sampson, S. D. 1994. \"Two new horned dinosaurs (Ornithischia: Ceratopsidae) from the Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation, Montana, USA\". ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'' '''14'''(3, supplement): 44A</ref> In 1995, Sampson published a larger article, indicating the holotype. The generic name ''Einiosaurus'' is derived from the Blackfeet ''eini'', \"[[American bison]]\", and Latinised Greek ''saurus'', \"lizard\". The name was chosen to honour the Blackfeet tribe but also to reflect the fact that ceratopids were, in Sampson's words, \"the buffalo of the Cretaceous\", living in herds and having a complex life. According to Sampson, the name should be pronounced as \"eye-knee-o-saurus\". The specific name is derived from [[Latin]] ''procurvus'', \"bent forwards\", and ''cornu'', \"horn\", referring to the forwards curving nasal horn.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nThe [[holotype]], '''MOR 456-8-9-6-1''', was found in a layer of the [[Two Medicine Formation]] dating from the late [[Campanian]]. It consists of a partial skull, including the nasal horn, the supraorbital area and part of the [[parietal bone]] of the skull frill. The skull represents an adult individual. Sampson referred many other specimens to the species. He indicated that additional fossil material from the Canyon Bone Bed had been subsumed under the inventory number MOR 456. This included two further adult skulls and single cranial and postcranial bones from individuals of varying age classes. Furthermore, the fossils from the Dino Ridge Quarry were referred. They had been catalogued within number MOR 373. They consisted of about two hundred non-articulated bones, again from animals of different ages.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nIn 2010, Paul renamed ''E. procurvicornis'' into ''Centrosaurus procurvicornis'',<ref name=\"Paul2010\"/> but this has found no acceptance, subsequent research invariably referring to the taxon as ''Einiosaurus''.\n\n==Description==\n===Size and distinguishing traits===\n[[File:Einiosaurus Scale.svg|thumb|Size comparison with human]]\n''Einiosaurus'' was a herbivorous dinosaur. It is generally as large as ''Achelousaurus'', though far less robust.<ref name=sampson1995 /> In 2010, [[Gregory S. Paul]] estimated the body length of ''Einiosaurus'' at 4.5 meters, its weight at 1.3 tonnes.<ref name=\"Paul2010\">Paul, G.S., 2010, ''The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs'', Princeton University Press p. 262</ref> Both taxa fall within the typical size range of the [[Centrosaurinae]].<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\n[[File:Einiosaurus BW.jpg|thumb|Restoration]]\nIn 1995, Sampson indicated several distinguishing traits. The nasal horn has a base that is long from front to rear, is transversely flattened, and is strongly curved forwards in some adult specimens. The supraorbital \"brow\" horns as far as they are present are low and rounded with a convex surface on the inner side. The parietal parts of the rear edge of the skull frill together bear a single pair of large curved spikes sticking out to behind.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\n''Einiosaurus'' differs from all other known Centrosaurinae by a longer-based and more procurved nasal horn and by a supraorbital horn that is longer-based and more rounded in side view. It differs from ''Achelousaurus'' in particular in having large parietal spikes that are not directed sideways to some extent.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nAs a centrosaurine, ''Einiosaurus'' walked on all fours, had a large head with a beak, a moderately large skull frill, a short powerful neck, heavily muscled forelimbs, a high torso,  powerful hindlimbs and a relatively short tail.\n\n===Skeleton===\nIn 1995, Sampson only described the skull, not the postcrania, the parts behind the skull. This was motivated by the fact that in centrosaurines the postcranial skeleton is \"conservative\", i.e. differs only slightly among species. Sampson could not find traits in which ''Einiosaurus'' differed from a generalised centrosaurine.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\n[[File:Nasals of Einiosaurus.jpg|thumb|Nasal bones of younger individuals in the top row and older individuals in the bottom row]] \nThe holotype skull is the largest known and has a total length of 156 centimetres. The snout is relatively narrow and pointed. The top of the snout is formed by the paired [[nasal bone]]s. Their top surfaces together bear the core of the nasal horn. In 1995, apart from the skulls eight nasal horns from both bonebeds were referred to ''Einiosaurus''. Two of these were from subadults. These show how the horn developed during the growth of the animal. The initially separated core halves fused from the tip downwards and joined into a single structure on the midline. In the subadult stage, the core still showed a suture, however. The subadult cores were transversely flattened and relatively small, not higher than twelve centimetres. Six cores were of adults. They showed two distinctive types. Two cores were small and erect, i.e. vertically directed. The four others were large and procurved, strongly curving to the front. The adult hornes resembled the subadult ones in being transversely compressed and having a long base from front to rear. To behind they nearly reached the [[frontal bone]]s.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nSampson compared the nasal horn of ''Einiosaurus'' with the horns of two related species, ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' and ''Styracosaurus''. From large bonebeds, numerous nasal horns of ''Centrosaurus'' are known, presenting a considerable range of morphologies. Despite all this variation, ''Einiosaurus'' horns can be clearly distinguished from them. They are more laterally compressed, unlike the more oval cross-section of ''Centrosaurus'' horns. The adult horns are also much more procurved than any nasal horn found in ''Centrosaurus'' beds. ''Styracosaurus'' horncores are much longer than those of ''Einiosaurus'', up to half a metre in length, and erect or slightly recurved to the rear.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nApart from a horn on the snout, centrosaurines also had horns above the eye sockets, supraorbital horncores. These cores were formed by a fusion of the [[postorbital bone]] with the much smaller [[palpebral bone]] in front of it. Nine subadult or adult \"brow horns\" were found. They all shared the same build in being low, long and rounded. This differs from the usual pointed horns with an oval base seen in typical centrosaurines. It is also unlike the supraorbital bosses seen in ''Achelousaurus'' and ''Pachyrhinosaurus''. Nevertheless, some ''Einiosaurus'' horns seemed to approach bosses. Three older individuals featured a total of five instances in which the horn as such was replaced by a low rounded mass, sometimes with a large pit in the usual location of the horn point. The large holotype has a rounded mass above the left eye socket but a pit, eighty-five millimetres long and sixty-four millimetres wide, on the right side. According to Sampson, this reflects a general trend with centrosaurines to re-absorb the brow horns in later life. All known specimens of ''Styracosaurus'' e.g. have a pitted region instead of true horns. The ''Einiosaurus'' holotype additionally has a rough bone mass at the rear postorbital region on the left side.<ref name=sampson1995 /> In all centrosaurines, the frontal bones re folded in such a way that a \"double\" roof is formed with a \"supracranial cavity\" in between. A [[fontanelle]] pierces the upper layer. In ''Einiosaurus'', this cavity runs sideways, continuing to below into the brow horn. With ''Centrosaurus'' and ''Styracosaurus'' these passages are more narrow and do not reach the horns but ''Pachyrhinosaurus'' shows a comparable extension. Sampson in 1995 also expounded his general views on such skull roofs, which are not easy to interpret due to fusion. According to him, the frontal bones always extended to the parietals, so that the paired postorbitals never contacted. The parietal bone made only a small contribution to the fontanelle. The floor of the cavity is, at the frontal-parietal suture, pierced by a large foramen into the braincase, the function of this \"pineal opening\" being unknown.<ref name=sampson1995 />\n\nIts snout is narrow and very pointed. It is typically portrayed with a low, strongly forward and downward curving nasal horn that resembles a bottle opener, though this may only occur in some adults. The supraorbital (over-the-eye) horns are low, short and triangular in top view if present at all, as opposed to the [[chasmosaurines]], such as ''[[Triceratops]]'', which have prominent supraorbital horns. A pair of large spikes, the third epiparietals, projects backwards from the relatively small frill. Smaller [[osteoderms]] adorn the frill edge. The first epiparietals are largely absent.\n\n==Classification==\nThe placement of ''Einiosaurus'' within [[Centrosaurinae]] is problematic due to the transitional nature of several of its skull characters, and its closest relatives are either ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' and ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' or ''[[Achelousaurus]]'' and ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]''. The latter hypothesis is supported by Horner and colleagues, where ''Einiosaurus'' is the earliest of an evolutionary series in which the nasal horns gradually change to rough bosses, as in ''Achelousaurus'' and ''Pachyrhinosaurus'' which are the second and third in this series. The frills also grow in complexity.<ref name=horneretal1992 />\n\nRegardless of which hypothesis is correct, ''Einiosaurus'' appears to occupy an intermediate position with respect to the [[evolution]] of the centrosaurines.\n[[File:Einiosaurus procurvicornis.jpg|thumb|upright|Parietal frill bones including holotype (A)]]\n\nThe [[cladogram]] presented below follows a phylogenetic analysis by Chiba ''et al.''

This is evidence that ''Einiosaurus'', as well as other centrosaurine ceratopsians such as ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]'' and ''[[Centrosaurus]]'', were herding animals similar in behavior to modern-day [[bison]] or [[wildebeest]]. In contrast, ceratopsine ceratopsids, such as ''[[Triceratops]]'' and ''[[Torosaurus]]'', are typically found singly, implying that they may have been somewhat solitary in life, though fossilized footprints may provide evidence to the contrary.<ref name=rogers1990 /> In 2010, a study by [[Julie Reizner]] of the individuals excavated at the Dino Ridge site concluded that ''Einiosaurus'' grew quickly until its third to fifth year of life after which growth slowed, probably at the onset of sexual maturity.<ref>Reizner, J., 2010, ''An ontogenetic series and population histology of the ceratopsid dinosaur ''Einiosaurus procurvicornis''.''
