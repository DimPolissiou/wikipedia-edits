Some countries demand the usage of the national identity card or a passport. Other countries allow usage of other documents like driver's licences.\n\nIn some countries, e.g. Austria, Finland and Sweden, national identity cards are fully voluntary and not needed by everyone, as identity documents like driving licences are accepted domestically. In these countries only a minority have a national identity card, since a majority have a passport and a driving licence and don't need more identity documents.

For example, where a supermarket in the UK refuses to accept a German national identity card as proof of age when a German citizen attempts to purchase an age-restricted product and insists on the production of a UK-issued passport or driving licence or other identity document, the supermarket would, in effect, be discriminating against this individual on this basis of his/her nationality in the provision of a service, thereby contravening the prohibition in [[Directive on services in the internal market|Art 20(2) of Directive 2006/123/EC]] of discriminatory treatment relating to the nationality of a service recipient in the conditions of access to a service which are made available to the public at large by a service provider.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2014-004933&language=EN|title=Answer to a written question - Validity of national ID cards - E-004933/2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 June 2014, [[The Guardian]] published leaked internal documents from [[HM Passport Office]] in the UK which revealed that government officials who dealt with [[British passport]] applications sent from overseas treated EU citizen counter-signatories differently depending on their nationality.

In contrast, citizens of other EU member states ([[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]] and [[Spain]]) acting as counter-signatories could only submit a copy of their passport and not their national identity card to prove their identity as national identity cards issued by these member states were deemed by HM Passport Office to be less secure and more susceptible to fraud/forgery. The day following the revelations, on 12 June 2014, the [[Home Office]] and HM Passport Office withdrew the leaked internal guidance relating to EU citizen counter-signatories submitting a copy of their national identity card instead of their passport as proof of identity, and all EU citizen counter-signatories are now able only to submit a copy of their passport and not of their national identity card.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications|title=Countersigning passport applications and photos - GOV.UK|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/12/ministers-intervene-to-prevent-relaxation-of-rules-in-passport-office|title=Ministers intervene to prevent relaxation of checks at Passport Office|first=Rajeev|last=Syal|date=11 June 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n==Common design and security features==\nOn 13 July 2005, the Justice and Home Affairs Council called on all [[European Union member state]]s to adopt common designs and security features for national identity cards by December 2005, with detailed standards being laid out as soon as possible thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/05/st14/st14351.en05.pdf|title=Council of the European Union: Draft Conclusions of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on common minimum security standards for Member States' national identity cards|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 December 2006, all [[European Union member state]]s agreed to adopt the following common designs and minimum security standards for national identity cards that were in the draft resolution of 15 November 2006:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statewatch.org/news/2006/dec/eu-id-cards.pdf|title=Council of the European Union: Draft Resolution of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council on common minimum security standards for Member States' national identity cards|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/EN-2006-REL.pdf|title=List of texts adopted by the Council in the JHA area&nbsp;\u2013 2006|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n; Material\nThe card can be made with paper core that is laminated on both sides or made entirely of a synthetic substrate.\n\n; Biographical data\n\nThe data on the card shall contain at least: name, birth date, nationality, a photo, signature, card number, and end date of validity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/9303_p5_cons_en.pdf|title=Machine Readable Travel Documents - Part 5|publisher=ICAO|access-date=2019-06-23}}</ref> Some cards contain more information such as height, eye colour, start date of validity, sex, issue place or province, and birth place.\n\nThe biographical data on the card is to be [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] and follow the ICAO specification for [[Machine-readable passport|machine-readable travel documents]].\n\nThe [[Regulation (European Union)|EU Regulation]] revising the Schengen Borders Code (which entered into force on 7 April 2017 and introduced systematic checks of the travel documents of EU, EEA and Swiss citizens against relevant databases when entering and leaving the [[Schengen Area]]) states that all member states should phase out travel documents (including national identity cards) which are not [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]].<ref>Recital 14 to Regulation (EU) 2017/458 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2017 amending Regulation (EU) 2016/399 as regards the reinforcement of checks against relevant databases at external borders ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2017.074.01.0001.01.ENG OJ L 74, 18 March 2017, p.1])</ref>\n\nHowever, as of 2017, Greece continues to issue solely non-machine readable identity cards, while Italy is in the process of phasing out the issuing of non-machine readable [[Identity document#Italy|paper booklets]] in favour of biometric cards.\n\n===Electronic identity cards===\nAll EEA electronic identity cards should comply with the [[ISO/IEC 14443|ISO/IEC standard 14443]].

Theoretically an ingenious attacker who has managed to secrete multiple reading devices in a distributed array (eg in arrival hall furniture) could distinguish bearers of MROTDs without having access to the relevant chip files. In concert with other information, this attacker might then be able to produce profiles specific to a particular card and, consequently its bearer. Defence is a trivial task when most electronic cards make new and randomised UIDs during every session [NH08] to preserve a level of privacy more comparable with contact cards than commercial RFID tags.<ref name=\"John Wiley & Sons\">{{cite book|last1=Helmbrecht|first1=Udo|last2=Naumann|first2=Ingo|chapter=8: Overview of European Electronic Identity Cards|editor1-last=Fumy|editor1-first=Walter|editor2-last=Paeschke|editor2-first=Manfred|title=Handbook of eID Security: Concepts, Practical Experiences, Technologies|volume=II|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|publication-date=2011|page=109|isbn=978-3-89578-379-1}}</ref>\n\nThe electronic identity cards of Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesdruckerei.de/sites/default/files/documents/2013/06/eid-card-pocketguide-en.pdf|title=Bundesdruckerei|publisher=}}</ref> Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Portugal and Spain all have a digital signature application which, upon activation, enables the bearer to authenticate the card using their confidential [[Personal identification number|PIN]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Consequently they can, at least theoretically, authenticate documents to satisfy any third party that the document's not been altered after being digitally signed.

Some countries demand the usage of the national identity card or a passport. Other countries allow usage of other documents like driver's licences.\n\nIn some countries, e.g. Austria, Finland and Sweden, national identity cards are fully voluntary and not needed by everyone, as identity documents like driving licences are accepted domestically. In these countries only a minority have a national identity card, since a majority have a passport and a driving licence and don't need more identity documents.

For example, where a supermarket in the UK refuses to accept a German national identity card as proof of age when a German citizen attempts to purchase an age-restricted product and insists on the production of a UK-issued passport or driving licence or other identity document, the supermarket would, in effect, be discriminating against this individual on this basis of his/her nationality in the provision of a service, thereby contravening the prohibition in [[Directive on services in the internal market|Art 20(2) of Directive 2006/123/EC]] of discriminatory treatment relating to the nationality of a service recipient in the conditions of access to a service which are made available to the public at large by a service provider.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2014-004933&language=EN|title=Answer to a written question - Validity of national ID cards - E-004933/2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 June 2014, [[The Guardian]] published leaked internal documents from [[HM Passport Office]] in the UK which revealed that government officials who dealt with [[British passport]] applications sent from overseas treated EU citizen counter-signatories differently depending on their nationality.

In contrast, citizens of other EU member states ([[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]] and [[Spain]]) acting as counter-signatories could only submit a copy of their passport and not their national identity card to prove their identity as national identity cards issued by these member states were deemed by HM Passport Office to be less secure and more susceptible to fraud/forgery.

Theoretically an ingenious attacker who has managed to secrete multiple reading devices in a distributed array (eg in arrival hall furniture) could distinguish bearers of MROTDs without having access to the relevant chip files. In concert with other information, this attacker might then be able to produce profiles specific to a particular card and, consequently its bearer. Defence is a trivial task when most electronic cards make new and randomised UIDs during every session [NH08] to preserve a level of privacy more comparable with contact cards than commercial RFID tags.<ref name=\"John Wiley & Sons\">{{cite book|last1=Helmbrecht|first1=Udo|last2=Naumann|first2=Ingo|chapter=8: Overview of European Electronic Identity Cards|editor1-last=Fumy|editor1-first=Walter|editor2-last=Paeschke|editor2-first=Manfred|title=Handbook of eID Security: Concepts, Practical Experiences, Technologies|volume=II|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|publication-date=2011|page=109|isbn=978-3-89578-379-1}}</ref>\n\nThe electronic identity cards of Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesdruckerei.de/sites/default/files/documents/2013/06/eid-card-pocketguide-en.pdf|title=Bundesdruckerei|publisher=}}</ref> Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Portugal and Spain all have a digital signature application which, upon activation, enables the bearer to authenticate the card using their confidential [[Personal identification number|PIN]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Consequently they can, at least theoretically, authenticate documents to satisfy any third party that the document's not been altered after being digitally signed.

Long considered a member of the [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] family, Turdidae, genetic evidence has placed it and its relatives in the [[Old World flycatcher]] family, Muscicapidae.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nTwo weakly defined [[subspecies]] are currently accepted:<ref name=Urquhart/>\n*''Saxicola rubicola rubicola''. In the south and east of its range, from [[Denmark]] southwest to [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]], east to [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]], and southeast to [[Turkey]].\n*''Saxicola rubicola hibernans''. Northwestern Europe in [[Atlantic]] coastal areas, in southwestern [[Norway]], [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]] and northwestern [[France]]. Birds in coastal [[Portugal]] are also often listed as this subspecies<ref name=Urquhart/> but this is disputed.<ref name=Siddle>Siddle, J. P. (2006). Which subspecies of Common Stonechat breeds in coastal Portugal? ''British Birds'' 99: 372-374.</ref>\n\nThe two subspecies differ in colour intensity following [[Gloger's rule]], with ''S. r. rubicola'' paler and with larger white patches in the drier European [[continental climate|continental]] and [[mediterranean climate]]s, and ''S. r. hibernans'' darker brown with less white in the humid Atlantic [[oceanic climate]]. They intergrade broadly where their ranges meet, from southeastern England<ref>Kehoe, C. (2006). Racial identification and assessment in Britain: a report from the RIACT subcommittee. ''British Birds'' 99: 619-645 [Stonechat, pp. 635-636].</ref> south through France and Spain, and many individuals are not identifiable to subspecies. Extreme examples of ''S. r. rubicola'' from the driest southern areas of its range such as the [[Algarve]] and [[Sicily]] are particularly pale and with a large white rump, and can be very similar to [[Siberian stonechat]]s in appearance.<ref name=Siddle/><ref name=Corso>Corso, A.

A new review adding [[mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] and nuclear DNA microsatellite fingerprinting evidence strongly supports their separation into distinct species.<ref name=Urquhart/><ref name=Wink/> Due to a misunderstanding of the rules of Zoological nomenclature, for a short time the name ''S. torquatus'' was erroneously used for the European stonechat rather than the African stonechat.<ref name=Wink/>\n\nTogether with the [[Siberian stonechat]] and [[Canary Islands stonechat]] it constitutes eastern and western representatives of a [[Eurasia]]n lineage; the Asian and European populations separated during the [[Late Pliocene]] or [[Early Pleistocene]], roughly 1.5-2.5 [[mya (unit)|mya]], and [[Fuerteventura]] was colonised by western European or northwest African birds somewhat later in the Early Pleistocene, about 1-2 mya.<ref name=Wink/>\n\nThe [[etymology]] of the English name derives from its call, sounding like two stones knocked together. The scientific name ''Saxicola'' means \"rock-dweller\", from [[Latin]] ''saxum'', a rock + ''incola'', dwelling in; and ''rubicola'', \"bramble-dweller\", from Latin ''[[Rubus]]'', brambles + ''incola'';<ref name =job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A. | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher=Christopher Helm | location = London, United Kingdom | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | pages =[https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling/page/n339 339], 349}}</ref> the subspecies name ''hibernans'' refers to Ireland (Latin, ''Hibernia'').\n\n==Description==\n\nThe stonechat is 11.5\u201313&nbsp;cm long and weighs 13\u201317 g, slightly smaller than the [[European robin]]. Both sexes have distinctively short wings, shorter than those of the more migratory [[whinchat]] and [[Siberian stonechat]]. The summer male has black upperparts, a black head, an orange throat and breast, and a white belly and vent. It also has a white half-collar on the sides of its neck, a small white scapular patch on the wings, and a very small white patch on the rump often streaked with black. The female has brown upperparts and head, and no white neck patches, rump or belly, these areas being streaked dark brown on paler brown, the only white being the scapular patch on the wings and even this often being buffy-white.<ref name=Urquhart>Urquhart, E., & Bowley, A.

They are short-distance [[bird migration|migrants]] or non-migratory, with part of the population (particularly from northeastern parts of the range, where winters are colder) moving south to winter further south in Europe and more widely in north Africa.<ref name=Urquhart/>\n\nThe male's song is high and twittering like a [[dunnock]].

Long considered a member of the [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] family, Turdidae, genetic evidence has placed it and its relatives in the [[Old World flycatcher]] family, Muscicapidae.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nTwo weakly defined [[subspecies]] are currently accepted:<ref name=Urquhart/>\n*''Saxicola rubicola rubicola''. In the south and east of its range, from [[Denmark]] southwest to [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]], east to [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]], and southeast to [[Turkey]].\n*''Saxicola rubicola hibernans''. Northwestern Europe in [[Atlantic]] coastal areas, in southwestern [[Norway]], [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]] and northwestern [[France]].

Which subspecies of Common Stonechat breeds in coastal Portugal? ''British Birds'' 99: 372-374.</ref>\n\nThe two subspecies differ in colour intensity following [[Gloger's rule]], with ''S. r. rubicola'' paler and with larger white patches in the drier European [[continental climate|continental]] and [[mediterranean climate]]s, and ''S. r. hibernans'' darker brown with less white in the humid Atlantic [[oceanic climate]]. They intergrade broadly where their ranges meet, from southeastern England<ref>Kehoe, C. (2006). Racial identification and assessment in Britain: a report from the RIACT subcommittee. ''British Birds'' 99: 619-645 [Stonechat, pp. 635-636].</ref> south through France and Spain, and many individuals are not identifiable to subspecies. Extreme examples of ''S. r. rubicola'' from the driest southern areas of its range such as the [[Algarve]] and [[Sicily]] are particularly pale and with a large white rump, and can be very similar to [[Siberian stonechat]]s in appearance.<ref name=Siddle/><ref name=Corso>Corso, A.

A new review adding [[mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] and nuclear DNA microsatellite fingerprinting evidence strongly supports their separation into distinct species.<ref name=Urquhart/><ref name=Wink/> Due to a misunderstanding of the rules of Zoological nomenclature, for a short time the name ''S. torquatus'' was erroneously used for the European stonechat rather than the African stonechat.<ref name=Wink/>\n\nTogether with the [[Siberian stonechat]] and [[Canary Islands stonechat]] it constitutes eastern and western representatives of a [[Eurasia]]n lineage; the Asian and European populations separated during the [[Late Pliocene]] or [[Early Pleistocene]], roughly 1.5-2.5 [[mya (unit)|mya]], and Fuerteventura was colonised by western European or northwest African birds somewhat later in the Early Pleistocene, about 1-2 mya.<ref name=Wink/>\n\nThe [[etymology]] of the English name derives from its call, sounding like two stones knocked together. The scientific name ''Saxicola'' means \"rock-dweller\", from [[Latin]] ''saxum'', a rock + ''incola'', dwelling in; and ''rubicola'', \"bramble-dweller\", from Latin ''[[Rubus]]'', brambles + ''incola'';<ref name =job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A. | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher=Christopher Helm | location = London, United Kingdom | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | pages =[https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling/page/n339 339], 349}}</ref> the subspecies name ''hibernans'' refers to Ireland (Latin, ''Hibernia'').\n\n==Description==\n\nThe stonechat is 11.5\u201313&nbsp;cm long and weighs 13\u201317 g, slightly smaller than the [[European robin]]. Both sexes have distinctively short wings, shorter than those of the more migratory [[whinchat]] and [[Siberian stonechat]]. The summer male has black upperparts, a black head, an orange throat and breast, and a white belly and vent. It also has a white half-collar on the sides of its neck, a small white scapular patch on the wings, and a very small white patch on the rump often streaked with black. The female has brown upperparts and head, and no white neck patches, rump or belly, these areas being streaked dark brown on paler brown, the only white being the scapular patch on the wings and even this often being buffy-white.<ref name=Urquhart>Urquhart, E., & Bowley, A.

They are short-distance [[bird migration|migrants]] or non-migratory, with part of the population (particularly from northeastern parts of the range, where winters are colder) moving south to winter further south in Europe and more widely in north Africa.<ref name=Urquhart/>\n\nThe male's song is high and twittering like a [[dunnock]].

His plays included Midnight in Moscow (which [[The Press]] reviewer Alan Scott called \"entertaining and thought-provoking\" and \"one of his best to date\"), 2005's Iraq-set Baghdad, Baby, and an adaptation of [[Nicky Hager]]'s expose The Hollow Men. Amongst his screenwork, he won awards in New Zealand for tele-play Share the Dream (starring [[Joel Tobeck]]), and co-writing successful big-screen comedy [[Came a Hot Friday]].<ref>[http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/dean-parker/biography \"Profile: Dean Parker\" - NZ On Screen]</ref> The 1985 film centered on two conmen in small town New Zealand, and was adapted from the novel by [[Ronald Hugh Morrieson]].\n\nParker's theatrical CV included The Feds, Two Fingers From Frank Zappa, and adaptations of [[Great Expectations]], and [[The Trial]].<ref name=\"NBR_38001\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/review-franz-kafka-what-a-trial-38001 |title=Review: Franz Kafka \u2013 What a trial |author=Daly-Peoples, John |date=19 November 2008 |work=[[National Business Review]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref> He also wrote many radio plays, among them Joe Stalin Knew My Father and Engels F: A History of the Ould Sod.\n\nArguably his best-known television work is Welsh-Kiwi rugby tale ''[[Old Scores]]'', which Parker co-wrote with ex All Black triallist and occasional soccer player [[Greg McGee]]. The two also co-created '80s trucking series Roche, whose cast included John Bach and [[Andy Anderson (actor)|Andy Anderson]], and goldmining drama [[Gold]], a co-production between New Zealand and Canada. Parker also worked on episodes of police drama [[Mortimer's Patch]], Betty's Bunch, and documentary Just Slightly, A People Apart: The Irish in NZ.\n\nIn 1990 Parker co-directed Shattered Dreams, a documentary on the years leading up to the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|'51 Waterfront strike]].\n\nParker was born in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], [[Hawke's Bay region|Hawke's Bay]]. By 1969 he was living in [[London]], [[England]]. While of mainly Irish ancestry, he knew little of the Irish struggle until \"troubles\" began that year in [[Northern Ireland]]. Parker joined the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Solidarity Campaign, led by the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] (now known as the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]]), and immersed himself in literature on the Irish struggle. He continued his involvement with the IS into the early '70s, attending branch meetings in West London, with his old Napier friend, [[Death of Blair Peach|Blair Peach]]. Peach was later killed while participating in a 1979 anti-[[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] rally.\n\nBy 1975, Parker was back in New Zealand. Horrified at the election of National Prime Minister, [[Rob Muldoon]], Parker joined the pro-Soviet [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]] and soon became chairman of its Auckland City Branch. He was active in the Campaign for an Independent East Timor and played soccer for the [[Halt All Racist Tours]] team for a number of years, though the quality of his play was purportedly variable.\n\nIn July 1977 he penned the first of many articles on Ireland for the SUP's paper, ''Tribune''. By the late '70s the SUP had decided to ally with the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]. Parker resigned from the SUP in 1978, though he remained a supporter into the late '80s.\n\nIn 1979 Parker travelled to [[Northern Ireland]], visiting West [[Belfast]] and trouble spots like the [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. Back in NZ, Parker helped form H Block/Armagh in 1980/81 as a support group for republican prisoners in Irish jails. Parker served on the editorial board of the organisation's publication ''Saoirse'' from 1982 until its demise in 2000. Parker contributed regular articles on Irish issues to SUP publications until the party split in 1990.\n\nIn 1991 Parker was a member of the Editorial Group of the socialist journal ''Agenda''. He was also active in the [[Workers' Charter]] Movement, a joint project of Socialist Worker, SPA, [[John Minto]]'s Global Peace and Justice Auckland and [[Matt McCarten]]'s [[Unite Union]].\n\nHe also contributed to the [[New Zealand Listener]] and the [[New Zealand Herald]].\n\nParker made no bones about his Marxism\u2013Leninism and injecting his politics into his art.\n\nIn the socialist journal ''Sites'' No 16 Autumn 1988 he wrote;  \"I would describe myself as a class-conscious writer. I'm with Lenin.

His plays included Midnight in Moscow (which [[The Press]] reviewer Alan Scott called \"entertaining and thought-provoking\" and \"one of his best to date\"), 2005's Iraq-set Baghdad, Baby, and an adaptation of [[Nicky Hager]]'s expose The Hollow Men. Amongst his screenwork, he won awards in New Zealand for tele-play Share the Dream (starring [[Joel Tobeck]]), and co-writing successful big-screen comedy [[Came a Hot Friday]].<ref>[http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/dean-parker/biography \"Profile: Dean Parker\" - NZ On Screen]</ref> The 1985 film centered on two conmen in small town New Zealand, and was adapted from the novel by [[Ronald Hugh Morrieson]].\n\nParker's theatrical CV included The Feds, Two Fingers From Frank Zappa, and adaptations of [[Great Expectations]], and [[The Trial]].<ref name=\"NBR_38001\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/review-franz-kafka-what-a-trial-38001 |title=Review: Franz Kafka \u2013 What a trial |author=Daly-Peoples, John |date=19 November 2008 |work=[[National Business Review]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref> He also wrote many radio plays, among them Joe Stalin Knew My Father and Engels F: A History of the Ould Sod.\n\nArguably his best-known television work is Welsh-Kiwi rugby tale [[Old Scores]], which Parker co-wrote with ex All Black triallist and occasional soccer player [[Greg McGee]]. The two also co-created '80s trucking series Roche, whose cast included John Bach and [[Andy Anderson (actor)|Andy Anderson]], and goldmining drama [[Gold]], a co-production between New Zealand and Canada. Parker also worked on episodes of police drama [[Mortimer's Patch]], Betty's Bunch, and documentary Just Slightly, A People Apart: The Irish in NZ.\n\nIn 1990 Parker co-directed Shattered Dreams, a documentary on the years leading up to the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|'51 Waterfront strike]].\n\nParker was born in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], [[Hawke's Bay region|Hawke's Bay]]. By 1969 he was living in [[London]], [[England]]. While of mainly Irish ancestry, he knew little of the Irish struggle until \"troubles\" began that year in [[Northern Ireland]]. Parker joined the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Solidarity Campaign, led by the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] (now known as the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]]), and immersed himself in literature on the Irish struggle. He continued his involvement with the IS into the early '70s, attending branch meetings in West London, with his old Napier friend, [[Death of Blair Peach|Blair Peach]]. Peach was later killed while participating in a 1979 anti-[[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] rally.\n\nBy 1975, Parker was back in New Zealand. Horrified at the election of National Prime Minister, [[Rob Muldoon]], Parker joined the pro-Soviet [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]] and soon became chairman of its Auckland City Branch. He was active in the Campaign for an Independent East Timor and played soccer for the [[Halt All Racist Tours]] team for a number of years, though the quality of his play was purportedly variable.\n\nIn July 1977 he penned the first of many articles on Ireland for the SUP's paper, ''Tribune''. By the late '70s the SUP had decided to ally with the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]. Parker resigned from the SUP in 1978, though he remained a supporter into the late '80s.\n\nIn 1979 Parker travelled to [[Northern Ireland]], visiting West [[Belfast]] and trouble spots like the [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. Back in NZ, Parker helped form H Block/Armagh in 1980/81 as a support group for republican prisoners in Irish jails. Parker served on the editorial board of the organisation's publication ''Saoirse'' from 1982 until its demise in 2000. Parker contributed regular articles on Irish issues to SUP publications until the party split in 1990.\n\nIn 1991 Parker was a member of the Editorial Group of the socialist journal ''Agenda''. He was also active in the [[Workers' Charter]] Movement, a joint project of Socialist Worker, SPA, [[John Minto]]'s Global Peace and Justice Auckland and [[Matt McCarten]]'s [[Unite Union]].\n\nHe also contributed to the [[New Zealand Listener]] and the [[New Zealand Herald]].\n\nParker made no bones about his Marxism\u2013Leninism and injecting his politics into his art.\n\nIn the socialist journal ''Sites'' No 16 Autumn 1988 he wrote;  \"I would describe myself as a class-conscious writer. I'm with Lenin. I'm for the working class seizing control of the wealth it creates, for the replacement of parliament, the army, the police, the judiciary - all those deadly manacles of state control - with workers' committees and militias, and all this done as part of a world-wide struggle..\"''\n\nParker and his partner Isobel lived in Auckland and had a son.
