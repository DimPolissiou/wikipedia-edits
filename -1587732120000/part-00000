''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot/midrashas}}'') is an institute of [[Torah study]] for women, generally in [[Israel]], and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men. \nAn alternative term, and translation, is '[[seminary]]' ({{hebrew|\u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05e8}}); <ref name=\"science.co.il\">[https://www.science.co.il/jewish-studies/Midrashot.php ''Midrashot''], science.co.il</ref> these are modeled on the [[Sarah_Schenirer#Teacher's_Seminary|institution established by Sarah Schenirer]] in 1923.\n\"''Midrasha''\" is associated with Religious Zionist institutions, while \"Seminary\" refers to ''[[Haredi]]'' institutions.\nA ''midrasha'' that offers [[academic degree|degree studies]] is sometimes called a ''machon'' ({{hebrew|\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df}}, institute).\n\nThe word \"''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''\" is based on the term ''[[beit midrash]]'', \"house of study\".  It is [[cognate]] with the [[Arabic]] \"''{{transl|ar|[[madrasa|madrasah]]}}'',\" which also refers to a place of learning.\n\nThe term ''Midrasha'' is sometimes used  more widely, referring to [[Cultural Judaism|pluralistic]], as opposed to [[orthodox Judaism|orthodox]], educational  institutions.\nIt may also refer to [[field school]]s that organize seminars and nature field trips.<ref name=\"science.co.il\"/>\n\n==Structure==\n===Curriculum===\n''{{lang|he-Latn|Midrashot}}'' and seminaries vary in curriculum and ''[[hashkafah]]'', or outlook. \n<ref name=\"Lilith\">[https://www.lilith.org/blog/2014/09/a-modest-year-in-israel-when-young-women-go-to-seminary/ A Modest Year in Israel: When Young Women go to \u201cSeminary\u201d]. [[Lilith (magazine)|''Lilith'']], 2014 </ref>\nAll cover [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Halacha|Jewish law]]  and [[Musar Literature|Musar (Ethics)]] / [[Hasidic philosophy|''Hasidus'']].<ref name=\"science.co.il\"/> \nDepending on the institution's stance, the weight and role assigned to Talmud particularly, and in fact to textual-skills generally, will differ re men's yeshivot, and between ''midrashot''.<ref name=\"Lilith\"/>\nSee [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]] for the general content of each topic. \n\n[[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' include the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]'s [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]], sister school of [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]].\nTreatment of Tanakh and Jewish philosophy,  referred to here as [[Jewish thought|''Machshavah'']],  will typically be text-focused, built around [[chavruta]]-based study as at yeshivot.<ref name=\"Lilith\"/>\nThis entails paired-study where assigned sources are prepared for ''[[shiur]]'', a lecture delivered as a discursive-review.\nAt some institutions, [[Talmud]] is studied directly, also as at men's ''yeshivot'', if less intensively (see [[Women in Judaism #Joseph Solovetchik]]); others treat Talmud as at seminary, below.\nRegardless, Jewish law will generally be studied with ''practice'' in view: i.e., as opposed to [[Yeshiva#Jewish_law|at a men's Yeshiva]], where the derivation is from Talmudic sources through codification. (At [[Matan_Women's_Institute_for_Torah_Studies|Matan]], [[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] and [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] the treatment is Talmud-based; see also [[Drisha Institute]].<ref>[https://www.drisha.co.il/ drisha.co.il]: \"\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05d1\u05e7\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05d4\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4\"</ref>)\nWomen usually attend ''Midrasha'' for one year, following or before ''[[Sherut Leumi]]'' (national service); a second year is sometimes offered. Programs often emphasize ''Machshavah'', deepening their students' religious identity at this life-stage;<ref>See discussion at the corresponding Hebrew article: [[:he: \u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05d4_\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea_\u05dc\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd]] </ref> this includes the writings of [[Rav Kook]], and ''[[Torat Eretz Yisrael]]'' in general.\n\nThe [[Haredi]] aligned seminaries - for example [[Beth Jacob Jerusalem]] - are modeled on the [[Beis Yaakov]] teacher-training seminary established by [[Sarah Schenirer]].\n(''Beis Yaakov'' almost invariably refers to high school, while \"Seminary\" is used for a post-high school institution.)\nSeminaries are typically more conservative in their approach than ''Midrashot'':\nselections from the Talmud - usually the non-legalistic ''[[aggadah]]'' - may be studied, but only in the context of other classes, especially philosophy and Musar; \nthese institutions then also assign less weight to textual skills,<ref name=\"Lilith\"/> with content delivered primarily via lecture.\n(See [[Bais Yaakov #Curriculum]], [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]].)\n[[Bais_Yaakov#Hasidic_schools|Hasidic-aligned institutions]], for example [[Beth Rivkah]], are similarly positioned;

The mountains of Armenia, however, formed natural borders between the different regions of the country and as a result, the feudalistic ''[[nakharar]]s'' had significant influence over the regions or provinces in which they were based.

By creating a stronger Hellenistic state, Mithridates was to contend with the well-established Roman foothold in Europe.<ref name=\"Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume I\"/> Mithridates executed a planned general attack on Romans and Italians in Asia Minor, tapping into local discontent with the Romans and their taxes and urging the peoples of Asia Minor to raise against foreign influence.

The southern border of his domain reached as far as [[Acre, Israel|Ptolemais]] (modern [[Akko]]). Many of the inhabitants of conquered cities were sent to his new [[Metropolitan area|metropolis]] of [[Tigranocerta]].\n\nAt its height, his empire extended from the [[Pontic Alps]] (in modern north-eastern Turkey) to [[Mesopotamia]], and from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the Mediterranean.

The \"King of Kings\" eventually came into direct contact with Rome. The Roman commander, [[Lucullus]], demanded the expulsion of Mithridates from Armenia \u2013 to comply with such a demand would be, in effect, to accept the status of vassal to Rome and this Tigranes refused.{{sfn|Greenhalgh|1981|p=74}} [[Charles Rollin]], in his ''Ancient History'', says:\n{{quotation|Tigranes, to whom Lucullus had sent an ambassador, though of no great power in the beginning of his reign, had enlarged it so much by a series of successes, of which there are few examples, that he was commonly surnamed \"King of Kings.\" After having overthrown and almost ruined the family of the kings, successors of the great Seleucus; after having very often humbled the pride of the Parthians, transported whole cities of Greeks into Media, conquered all Syria and Palestine, and given laws to the Arabians called Scenites, he reigned with an authority respected by all the princes of Asia.

According to Roman historians Mithrobazanes, one of Tigranes' generals, told Tigranes of the Roman approach. Tigranes was, according to Keaveney, so impressed by Mithrobazanes' courage that he appointed Mithrobazanes to command an  army against Lucullus \u2013 Tigranes sent Mithrobarzanes with 2,000-3,000 cavalry to expel the invader. Mithrobarzanes charged the Romans while they were setting up their camp, but was met by a 3,500-strong sentry force and his horsemen were routed. He perished in the attempt.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great'', pp 127-128; Lee Frantatuono, ''Lucullus'', pp 83-84; Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'', XII.84.</ref>{{sfn|Keaveney|1992|pp=106-107}} After this defeat Tigranes withdrew north to Armenia to regroup which left Lucullus free to put Tigranocerta under siege.{{sfn|Keaveney|1992|p=107}}\n\nWhen Tigranes had gathered a large army, he returned to confront Lucullus.  On October 6, 69 BC, Tigranes' much larger force was decisively defeated by the [[Roman army]] under Lucullus in the [[Battle of Tigranocerta]]. Tigranes' treatment of the inhabitants (the majority of the population had been forced to move to the city) led disgruntled city guards to open the gates of the city to the Romans. Learning of this, Tigranes hurriedly sent 6000 cavalrymen to the city in order to rescue his wives and some of his assets.<ref name=\"Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume I\"/> Tigranes escaped capture with a small escort.\n\nOn October 6, 68 BC, the Romans approached the old capital of [[Battle of Artaxata|Artaxata]]. Tigranes' and Mithridates' combined Armeno-Pontic army of 70,000 men formed up to face them but were resoundingly defeated. Once again, both Mithridates and Tigranes evaded capture by the victorious Romans. However, the Armenian historians claim that the Romans lost the battle of Artaxata and Lucullus' following withdrawal from the Kingdom of Armenia in reality was an escape due to the above-mentioned defeat. The Armenian-Roman wars are depicted in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''Voyage to the Caucasus''.\n \nThe long campaigning and hardships that Lucullus' troops had endured for years, combined with a perceived lack of reward in the form of plunder,<ref name=\"Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume I\"/> led to successive mutinies among the legions in 68\u201367. Frustrated by the rough terrain of Northern Armenia and seeing the worsening morale of his troops, Lucullus moved back south and put Nisibis under siege. Tigranes concluded (wrongly) that Nisibis would hold out and sought to regain those parts of Armenia that the Romans had captured.{{sfn|Keaveney|1992|p=119}} Despite his continuous success in battle, Lucullus could still not capture either one of the monarchs. With Lucullus' troops now refusing to obey his commands, but agreeing to defend positions from attack, the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] sent [[Pompey]] to recall Lucullus to Rome and take over his command.\n\n==Pompey and submission to Rome==\n[[File:\u054f\u056b\u0563\u0580\u0561\u0576 \u0544\u0565\u056e Statue of Tigranes the Great in Yerevan.jpg|thumb|Statue of Tigranes the Great in Yerevan]]\nIn 67 BC<ref>The Encyclopaedia of Military History, R E Dupuy and T N Dupuy</ref> [[Pompey]] was given the task of defeating Mithridates and Tigranes.{{sfn|Greenhalgh|1981|p=105}} Pompey first concentrated on  attacking Mithridates while distracting Tigranes by engineering a Parthian attack on [[Gordyene]].{{sfn|Greenhalgh|1981|p=105, 114}} [[Phraates III of Parthia|Phraates III]], the Parthian king, was soon persuaded to take things a little further than an annexation of Gordyene when a son of Tigranes (also named Tigranes) went to join the Parthians and persuaded Phraates to invade Armenia in an attempt to replace the elder Tigranes with the [[Tigranes the Younger]].{{sfn|Greenhalgh|1981|p=114}} Tigranes decided not to meet the invasion in the field but instead ensured that his capital, Artaxata, was well defended and withdrew to the hill country. Phraates soon realized that Artaxata would not fall without a protracted siege, the time for which he could not spare due to his fear of plots at home. Once Phraates left, Tigranes came back down from the hills and drove his son from Armenia. The son then fled to Pompey.{{sfn|Greenhalgh|1981|p=115}}\n\nIn 66 BC, Pompey advanced into [[Armenia]] with Tigranes the Younger, and Tigranes, now almost 75 years old, surrendered.

The mountains of Armenia, however, formed natural borders between the different regions of the country and as a result, the feudalistic ''[[nakharar]]s'' had significant influence over the regions or provinces in which they were based.

By creating a stronger Hellenistic state, Mithridates was to contend with the well-established Roman foothold in Europe.<ref name=\"Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume I\"/> Mithridates executed a planned general attack on Romans and Italians in Asia Minor, tapping into local discontent with the Romans and their taxes and urging the peoples of Asia Minor to raise against foreign influence.

The southern border of his domain reached as far as [[Acre, Israel|Ptolemais]] (modern [[Akko]]). Many of the inhabitants of conquered cities were sent to his new [[Metropolitan area|metropolis]] of [[Tigranocerta]].\n\nAt its height, his empire extended from the [[Pontic Alps]] (in modern north-eastern Turkey) to [[Mesopotamia]], and from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the Mediterranean.

According to Roman historians Mithrobazanes, one of Tigranes' generals, told Tigranes of the Roman approach. Tigranes was, according to Keaveney, so impressed by Mithrobazanes' courage that he appointed Mithrobazanes to command an  army against Lucullus \u2013 Tigranes sent Mithrobarzanes with 2,000-3,000 cavalry to expel the invader. Mithrobarzanes charged the Romans while they were setting up their camp, but was met by a 3,500-strong sentry force and his horsemen were routed. He perished in the attempt.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great'', pp 127-128; Lee Frantatuono, ''Lucullus'', pp 83-84; Plutarch, ''Life of Lucullus'', XII.84.</ref>{{sfn|Keaveney|1992|pp=106-107}} After this defeat Tigranes withdrew north to Armenia to regroup which left Lucullus free to put Tigranocerta under siege.{{sfn|Keaveney|1992|p=107}}\n\nWhen Tigranes had gathered a large army, he returned to confront Lucullus.  On October 6, 69 BC, Tigranes' much larger force was decisively defeated by the [[Roman army]] under Lucullus in the [[Battle of Tigranocerta]]. Tigranes' treatment of the inhabitants (the majority of the population had been forced to move to the city) led disgruntled city guards to open the gates of the city to the Romans. Learning of this, Tigranes hurriedly sent 6000 cavalrymen to the city in order to rescue his wives and some of his assets.<ref name=\"Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume I\"/> Tigranes escaped capture with a small escort.\n\nOn October 6, 68 BC, the Romans approached the old capital of [[Battle of Artaxata|Artaxata]]. Tigranes' and Mithridates' combined Armeno-Pontic army of 70,000 men formed up to face them but were resoundingly defeated. Once again, both Mithridates and Tigranes evaded capture by the victorious Romans. However, the Armenian historians claim that the Romans lost the battle of Artaxata and Lucullus' following withdrawal from the Kingdom of Armenia in reality was an escape due to the above-mentioned defeat. The Armenian-Roman wars are depicted in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''Voyage to the Caucasus''.\n \nThe long campaigning and hardships that Lucullus' troops had endured for years, combined with a perceived lack of reward in the form of plunder,<ref name=\"Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume I\"/> led to successive mutinies among the legions in 68\u201367. Frustrated by the rough terrain of Northern Armenia and seeing the worsening morale of his troops, Lucullus moved back south and put Nisibis under siege. Tigranes concluded (wrongly) that Nisibis would hold out and sought to regain those parts of Armenia that the Romans had captured.{{sfn|Keaveney|1992|p=119}} Despite his continuous success in battle, Lucullus could still not capture either one of the monarchs. With Lucullus' troops now refusing to obey his commands, but agreeing to defend positions from attack, the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] sent [[Pompey]] to recall Lucullus to Rome and take over his command.\n\n==Pompey and submission to Rome==\n[[File:\u054f\u056b\u0563\u0580\u0561\u0576 \u0544\u0565\u056e Statue of Tigranes the Great in Yerevan.jpg|thumb|Statue of Tigranes the Great in Yerevan]]\nIn 67 BC<ref>The Encyclopaedia of Military History, R E Dupuy and T N Dupuy</ref> [[Pompey]] was given the task of defeating Mithridates and Tigranes.{{sfn|Greenhalgh|1981|p=105}} Pompey first concentrated on  attacking Mithridates while distracting Tigranes by engineering a Parthian attack on [[Gordyene]].{{sfn|Greenhalgh|1981|p=105, 114}} [[Phraates III of Parthia|Phraates III]], the Parthian king, was soon persuaded to take things a little further than an annexation of Gordyene when a son of Tigranes (also named Tigranes) went to join the Parthians and persuaded Phraates to invade Armenia in an attempt to replace the elder Tigranes with the [[Tigranes the Younger]].{{sfn|Greenhalgh|1981|p=114}} Tigranes decided not to meet the invasion in the field but instead ensured that his capital, Artaxata, was well defended and withdrew to the hill country. Phraates soon realized that Artaxata would not fall without a protracted siege, the time for which he could not spare due to his fear of plots at home. Once Phraates left, Tigranes came back down from the hills and drove his son from Armenia. The son then fled to Pompey.{{sfn|Greenhalgh|1981|p=115}}\n\nIn 66 BC, Pompey advanced into [[Armenia]] with Tigranes the Younger, and Tigranes, now almost 75 years old, surrendered.

{"title_page": "Shunt (electrical)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Shunt (disambiguation){{!}}Shunt}}\n{{more footnotes|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn [[electronics]], a '''shunt''' is a device that creates a low-[[Electrical resistance|resistance]] path for [[electric current]], to allow it to pass around another point in the [[electrical network|circuit]].<ref name=Graf68 >Rudolf F. Graf, ''Modern dictionary of Electronics'', Mc-Graw Hill, 1968 Library of Congress 68-13873  ''Shunt'' page 454.</ref> The origin of the term is in the verb 'to shunt' meaning to turn away or follow a different path.\n\n==Defective device bypass==\n\nOne example is in miniature [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas lights]] which are [[series circuit|wired in series]].  When the [[Electrical filament|filament]] burns out in one of the [[incandescent light bulb]]s,  the full line [[voltage]] appears across the burnt out bulb. A shunt [[resistor]], which has been connected [[parallel circuits|in parallell]] across the filament before it burnt out, will then short out to bypass the burnt filament and allow the rest of the string to light.  If too many lights burn out however, a shunt will also burn out, requiring the use of a [[multimeter]] to find the point of failure.\n\n==Photovoltaics==\n\nIn [[photovoltaics]], the term is widely used to describe an ''unwanted'' short circuit between the front and back surface contacts of a [[solar cell]], usually caused by [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] damage.\n\n==Lightning arrestor==\n\nA [[gas]]-filled tube can also be used as a shunt, particularly in a [[lightning arrestor]].  [[Neon]] and other [[noble gas]]es have a high [[breakdown voltage]], so that normally current will not flow across it.  However, a direct [[lightning]] strike (such as on a [[radio masts and towers|radio tower]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]) will cause the shunt to [[electric arc|arc]] and conduct the massive amount of electricity to [[ground (electricity)|ground]], protecting [[transmitter]]s and other equipment.\n\nAnother older form of lightning arrestor employs a simple narrow spark gap, over which an arc will jump when a high voltage is present. While this is a low cost solution, its high triggering voltage offers almost no protection for modern solid-state electronic devices powered by the protected circuit.\n\n==Electrical noise bypass==\n\n[[Capacitor]]s are used as shunts to redirect high-frequency noise to ground before it can propagate to the load or other circuit components.\n\n==Use in electronic filter circuits==\nThe term shunt is used in [[Electronic filter|filter]] and similar circuits with a [[Ladder network|ladder topology]] to refer to the components connected between the line and common. The term is used in this context to distinguish the shunt components connected between the signal and return lines from the components connected in series along the signal line.  More generally, the term shunt can be used for a component connected in parallel with another. For instance, ''shunt [[M-derived filters|m-derived]] half section'' is a common filter section from the [[image impedance]] method of filter design.<ref>Matthaei, Young, Jones ''Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures'', p66, McGraw-Hill 1964</ref>\n\n==Diodes as shunts==\nWhere devices are vulnerable to reverse polarity of a signal or power supply, a [[diode]] may be used to protect the circuit. If connected in series with the circuit it simply prevents reversed current, but if connected in parallel it can shunt the reversed supply, causing a fuse or other current limiting circuit to open.\n\nAll semiconductor diodes have a threshold voltage &ndash; typically between \u00bd&nbsp;Volt and 1&nbsp;Volt &ndash; that must be exceeded before significant current will flow through the diode in the normally allowed direction. Two anti-parallel shunt diodes (one to conduct current in each direction) can be used to limit the signal flowing past them to no more than their threshold voltages, in order to protect later components from overload.\n\n==Shunts as circuit protection==\n\nWhen a circuit must be protected from overvoltage and there are failure modes in the power supply that can produce such overvoltages, the circuit may be protected by a device commonly called a [[Crowbar (circuit)|crowbar circuit]]. When this device detects an overvoltage it causes a short circuit between the power supply and its return. This will cause both an immediate drop in voltage (protecting the device) and an instantaneous high current which is expected to open a current sensitive device (such as a [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or [[circuit breaker]]). This device is called a ''crowbar'' as it is likened to dropping an actual [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] across a set of [[bus bar]]s (exposed electrical conductors).\n\n==Battle short==\n\nOn warships, it is common to install [[battle short]] shunts across fuses for essential equipment before entering combat.  This disables [[overcurrent protection]] at a time when removing power to the equipment is not a safe reaction.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Shunting an instrument but series connected in circuit==\n[[File:AC src meters with meter-shunts speaker load with load-shunt.jpg|thumb|AC source with meters and meter-shunts plus load with load-shunt]]\nAs an introduction to the next chapter, this figure shows that the term \"shunt resistor\" should be understood in the context of what it shunts.\n\nIn this example the resistor R<sub>L</sub> would be understood as \"the shunt resistor\" (to the load L), because this resistor would pass current around the load L. R<sub>L</sub> is connected in [[Parallel_circuits|parallel]] with the load L. \n\nHowever, the [[Series_circuits|series resistors]] R<sub>M1</sub> and R<sub>M2</sub> are low Ohmic resistors (like in the photo) meant to pass current around the instruments M1 and M2, and function as shunt resistors to those instruments. R<sub>M1</sub> and R<sub>M2</sub> are connected in [[Parallel_circuits|parallel]] with M1 and M2. If seen without the instruments these two resistors would be considered [[Series_circuits|series resistors]] in this circuit.\n\n==Use in current measuring==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Ammeter]] -->\n[[Image:Shuntresistor50A.jpg|right|thumb|200px|50&nbsp;A shunt resistor, with provision for [[four-terminal sensing]]]]\n{{Further|current sensing}}\n\nAn [[ammeter]] shunt allows the measurement of [[electrical current|current]] values too large to be directly measured by a particular ammeter. In this case, a separate shunt, a [[resistor]] of very low but accurately known [[electrical resistance|resistance]], is placed in parallel with a [[voltmeter]], so that virtually all of the current to be measured will flow through the shunt (provided the internal resistance of the voltmeter takes such a low portion of the current that it is neglible). The resistance is chosen so that the resultant [[voltage drop]] is measurable but low enough not to disrupt the [[electrical circuit|circuit]]. The voltage across the shunt is proportional to the current flowing through it, and so the measured voltage can be scaled to directly display the current value.<ref name=GE49>''Manual of Electric Instruments'', General Electric, 1949, pages 8\u20139</ref><ref name=Croft48>Terrell Croft, ''American Electricians' Handbook'', McGraw-Hill, 1948 p. 70</ref>\n\nShunts are rated by the maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500&nbsp;A, 75&nbsp;mV shunt would have a resistance of {{val|150|u=micro[[ohm]]}}, a maximum allowable current of 500 [[ampere|amp]]s and at that current the voltage drop would be 75 [[millivolt]]s. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50&nbsp;mV, 75&nbsp;mV or 100&nbsp;mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100&nbsp;mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous (more than 2 minutes) use, 66% being the most common, so the example shunt should not be operated above 330&nbsp; A (and 50&nbsp; mV drop) longer than that.\n\nThis limitation is due to thermal limits at which a shunt will no longer operate correctly.  For [[manganin]], a common shunt material, at 80&nbsp;\u00b0C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120&nbsp;\u00b0C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percents and at 140&nbsp;\u00b0C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n \nIf the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself.<ref name=GE49/> Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg ([[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are [[Hall effect]] current sensors and [[current transformer]]s (see [[clamp meter]]s). Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] specifications of such devices are \u00b10.1%, \u00b10.25% or \u00b10.5%.\n\nThe Thomas-type double manganin walled shunt and MI type (improved Thomas-type design) were used by [[NIST]] and other standards laboratories as the legal reference of an ohm until superseded in 1990 by the [[quantum Hall effect]].  Thomas-type shunts are still used as secondary standards to take very accurate current measurements, as using the quantum Hall effect is a time-consuming process.  The accuracy of these types of shunts is measured in the ppm and sub-ppm scale of drift per year of set resistance.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Century of Excellence in Measurements, Standards, and Technology: A Chronicle of Selected NBS/ NIST Publications 1901\u20132000 |contribution=Stability of Double-Walled Manganin Resistors |editor=Davide R.

A shunt in the ungrounded conductor must be insulated for the full circuit voltage to the ground; the measuring instrument must be inherently isolated from the ground or must include a resistive voltage divider or an [[isolation amplifier]] between the relatively high common-mode voltage and lower voltages inside the instrument. A shunt in the grounded conductor may not detect leakage current that bypasses the shunt, but it will not experience high common-mode voltage to ground.  The load is removed from a direct path to ground, which may create problems for control circuitry, result in unwanted emissions, or both.

When this device detects an overvoltage it causes a short circuit between the power supply and its return. This will cause both an immediate drop in voltage (protecting the device) and an instantaneous high current which is expected to open a current sensitive device (such as a [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or [[circuit breaker]]). This device is called a ''crowbar'' as it is likened to dropping an actual [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] across a set of [[bus bar]]s (exposed electrical conductors).\n\n==Battle short==\n\nOn warships, it is common to install [[battle short]] shunts across fuses for essential equipment before entering combat.  This disables [[overcurrent protection]] at a time when removing power to the equipment is not a safe reaction.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Shunting an instrument but series connected in circuit==\n[[File:AC src meters with meter-shunts speaker load with load-shunt.jpg|thumb|AC source with meters and meter-shunts plus load with load-shunt]]\nAs an introduction to the next chapter, this figure shows that the term \"shunt resistor\" should be understood in the context of what it shunts.\n\nIn this example the resistor R<sub>L</sub> would be understood as \"the shunt resistor\" (to the load L), because this resistor would pass current around the load L. R<sub>L</sub> is connected in [[Parallel_circuits|parallel]] with the load L. \n\nHowever, the [[Series_circuits|series resistors]] R<sub>M1</sub> and R<sub>M2</sub> are low Ohmic resistors (like in the photo) meant to pass current around the instruments M1 and M2, and function as shunt resistors to those instruments. R<sub>M1</sub> and R<sub>M2</sub> are connected in [[Parallel_circuits|parallel]] with M1 and M2. If seen without the instruments these two resistors would be considered [[Series_circuits|series resistors]] in this circuit.\n\n==Use in current measuring==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Ammeter]] -->\n[[Image:Shuntresistor50A.jpg|right|thumb|200px|50&nbsp;A shunt resistor, with provision for [[four-terminal sensing]]]]\n{{Further|current sensing}}\n\nAn [[ammeter]] shunt allows the measurement of [[electrical current|current]] values too large to be directly measured by a particular ammeter. In this case, a separate shunt, a [[resistor]] of very low but accurately known [[electrical resistance|resistance]], is placed in parallel with a [[voltmeter]], so that all of the current to be measured will flow through the shunt. The resistance is chosen so that the resultant [[voltage drop]] is measurable but low enough not to disrupt the [[electrical circuit|circuit]]. The voltage across the shunt is proportional to the current flowing through it, and so the measured voltage can be scaled to directly display the current value.<ref name=GE49>''Manual of Electric Instruments'', General Electric, 1949, pages 8\u20139</ref><ref name=Croft48>Terrell Croft, ''American Electricians' Handbook'', McGraw-Hill, 1948 p. 70</ref>\n\nShunts are rated by the maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500&nbsp;A, 75&nbsp;mV shunt would have a resistance of {{val|150|u=micro[[ohm]]}}, a maximum allowable current of 500 [[ampere|amp]]s and at that current the voltage drop would be 75 [[millivolt]]s. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50&nbsp;mV, 75&nbsp;mV or 100&nbsp;mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100&nbsp;mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous (more than 2 minutes) use, 66% being the most common, so the example shunt should not be operated above 330&nbsp; A (and 50&nbsp; mV drop) longer than that.\n\nThis limitation is due to thermal limits at which a shunt will no longer operate correctly.  For [[manganin]], a common shunt material, at 80&nbsp;\u00b0C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120&nbsp;\u00b0C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percents and at 140&nbsp;\u00b0C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n \nIf the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself.<ref name=GE49/> Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg ([[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are [[Hall effect]] current sensors and [[current transformer]]s (see [[clamp meter]]s). Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] specifications of such devices are \u00b10.1%, \u00b10.25% or \u00b10.5%.\n\nThe Thomas-type double manganin walled shunt and MI type (improved Thomas-type design) were used by [[NIST]] and other standards laboratories as the legal reference of an ohm until superseded in 1990 by the [[quantum Hall effect]].  Thomas-type shunts are still used as secondary standards to take very accurate current measurements, as using the quantum Hall effect is a time-consuming process.  The accuracy of these types of shunts is measured in the ppm and sub-ppm scale of drift per year of set resistance.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Century of Excellence in Measurements, Standards, and Technology: A Chronicle of Selected NBS/ NIST Publications 1901\u20132000 |contribution=Stability of Double-Walled Manganin Resistors |editor=Davide R.

A shunt in the ungrounded conductor must be insulated for the full circuit voltage to the ground; the measuring instrument must be inherently isolated from the ground or must include a resistive voltage divider or an [[isolation amplifier]] between the relatively high common-mode voltage and lower voltages inside the instrument. A shunt in the grounded conductor may not detect leakage current that bypasses the shunt, but it will not experience high common-mode voltage to ground.  The load is removed from a direct path to ground, which may create problems for control circuitry, result in unwanted emissions, or both.
