The suggested format was one where after the first round the top six teams would continue while the bottom three teams would have other matches arranged for them.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=86\n| date = 1924-04-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240410.2.136.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-04}}</ref> However all nine teams remained in the grade until the end of the season. The Mangere United team was a combined team from the Manukau and Mangere clubs. Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\n\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on [[Carlaw Park]]. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\n\n[[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist Win Final Replay/Twenty Points to Seventeen/Devonport Just Beaten\n| page =6\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXI| issue=18826\n| date = 1924-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240929.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-09}}</ref> While City won the Roope Rooster competition for the 4th time.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=16th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1924}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1925 Auckland Rugby League season|1925]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Lou Brown Transfer Issue===\n[[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], the New Zealand international had played for [[Newton Rangers]] in 1922 and 1923 however at the end of the season he moved to England to play for Wigan. He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> On 18 July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> The Secretary of the club, C.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, 23 August onwards.\n\n== Monteith Shield (First Grade Championship) ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

The Mangere United team was a combined team from the Manukau and Mangere clubs. Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\n\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on [[Carlaw Park]]. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\n\n[[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist Win Final Replay/Twenty Points to Seventeen/Devonport Just Beaten\n| page =6\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXI| issue=18826\n| date = 1924-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240929.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-09}}</ref> While City won the Roope Rooster competition for the 4th time.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=16th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1924}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1925 Auckland Rugby League season|1925]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Lou Brown Transfer Issue===\n[[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], the New Zealand international had played for [[Newton Rangers]] in 1922 and 1923 however at the end of the season he moved to England to play for Wigan. He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> On 18 July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> The Secretary of the club, C.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, 23 August onwards.\n\n== Monteith Shield (First Grade Championship) ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

As a result many players from the struggling [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] team made the trip to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Win for South Auckland/Auckland Defeated By 21 To 5/Mediocre Representative Team\n| page =4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXI| issue=18820\n| date = 1924-09-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240922.2.7.5\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 4 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 15\u20137\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Visiting League Team/Australian Universities/Auckland Wins First Game/Fifteen Points to Seven/Superiority Throughout\n| page =9\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXI| issue=18727\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240605.2.124\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]], [[Ivan Littlewood]] 2\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Bert Laing]]\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 = Barry\n| con2 = Ryan\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = Neild\n}}\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 7 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 17\u20132\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Beaten Again/Aussies\u2019 Poor Exhibition/Auckland Too Good/Football in the Mud\n| page =10\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=135\n| date = 1924-06-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240609.2.122\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]], McNeil, [[Nelson Bass]]\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 3\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Gallagher\n}}\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n[[Frank Delgrosso]] had to come on the replace [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] after he collided badly with team mate [[Clarrie Polson]] when they were both going after the ball.

Some web developers work for one organization as a permanent [[Full-time job|full-time]] employee, while others may work as independent [[consultants]], or as contractors for an agency or at home personal use. Web developers typically handle both [[server-side]] and [[Front end development|front-end]] logic.

For example, in a two-person team, one developer may focus on the technologies sent to the [[Client-side|client]] such as [[HTML]], [[JavaScript]], [[CSS]],  [[React (JavaScript library)|ReactJs]] or [[AngularJS]] and on the [[server-side]] frameworks (such as [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[ASP.NET]], [[Node.js]]) used to deliver content and scripts to the client. Meanwhile, the other developer might focus on the interaction between server-side frameworks, the [[webserver]], and a [[database]] system. Further, depending on the size of their organization, the aforementioned developers might work closely with a content creator/copywriter, marketing adviser, [[user experience design]]er, [[web designer]], [[web producer]], [[project manager]], [[software architect]], or [[database administrator]] - or they may be responsible for such tasks as [[web design]] and [[project management]] themselves.\n\n== Educational and licensure requirements ==\n\nThere are no formal educational or licensure requirements to become a web developer.

He represents the post-[[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfieldian]] phase of [[structuralism (linguistics)|structuralism]] often referred to as \"[[distributionalism]]\" or \"taxonomic structuralism\". His academic career spanned over half a century at Cornell and Rice universities. Hockett was also a firm believer of linguistics as a branch of anthropology, making contributions that were significant to the field of anthropology as well.\n\n==Professional and academic career <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/hockett-charles.pdf|title=National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir|last=Gair|first=James W.|date=2006|website=National Academy of Sciences online|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>==\n\n===Education===\nAt the age of 16, Hockett enrolled at [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Master of Arts]] in [[ancient history]]. While enrolled at [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], Hockett became interested in the work of [[Leonard Bloomfield]], a leading figure in the field of [[structural linguistics]]. Hockett continued his education at [[Yale University]] where he studied [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] and received his [[doctor of philosophy|PhD]] in anthropology in 1939. While studying at Yale, Hockett studied with several other influential linguists such as [[Edward Sapir]], [[George P. Murdock]], and [[Benjamin Whorf]]. Hockett's dissertation was based on his fieldwork in [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]]; his paper on Potawatomi [[syntax]] was published in ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'' in 1939. In 1948 his [[dissertation]] was published as a series in the [[International Journal of American Linguistics]]. Following fieldwork in [[Kickapoo language|Kickapoo]] and [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Mexico]], Hockett did two years of [[postdoctoral]] study with [[Leonard Bloomfield]] in [[Chicago]] and [[Michigan]].\n\n===Career===\nHockett began his teaching career in 1946 as an assistant professor of linguistics in the Division of [[Modern Languages]] at [[Cornell University]] where he was responsible for directing the [[Chinese language]] program. In 1957, Hockett became a member of Cornell's anthropology department and continued to teach anthropology and linguistics until he retired to [[emeritus|emeritus status]] in 1982. In 1986, he took up an adjunct post at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston, Texas]], where he remained active until his death in 2000.\n\n===Achievements===\nCharles Hockett held membership among many academic institutions such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[Society of Fellows]] at [[Harvard University]]. He served as president of both the [[Linguistic Society of America]] and the Linguistic Association of Canada and the United States.\n\nIn addition to making many contributions to the field of [[structural linguistics]], Hockett also considered such things as [[Benjamin Whorf|Whorfian Theory]], [[jokes]], the nature of [[writing systems]], slips of the tongue, and [[animal communication]] and their relativeness to [[speech]].\n\nOutside the realm of linguistics and anthropology, Hockett practiced [[Musical theatre|musical]] performance and [[Musical composition|composition]]. Hockett composed a full-length [[opera]] called ''The Love of Do\u00f1a Rosita'' which was based on a play by [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] and premiered at [[Ithaca College]] by the [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] [[Opera]].\n\nHockett and his wife Shirley were vital leaders in the development of the [[Cayuga, New York|Cayuga]] Chamber Orchestra in Ithaca, New York. In appreciation of the Hocketts' hard work and dedication to the Ithaca community, Ithaca College established the Charles F. Hockett Music Scholarship, the Shirley and Chas Hockett Chamber Music Concert Series, and the Hockett Family Recital Hall.\n\n==View on linguistics==\nIn his paper \"A Note on Structure\", he proposes that [[linguistics]] can be seen as \"a game and as a science.\" A linguist as a player in the game of langauges has the freedom to experiment on all utterances of a language, but must ensure that \"all the utterances of the corpus must be taken into account.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/doi/abs/10.1086/464015|title=A Note on 'Structure' [Review of de Goeje by W. D. Preston]|last=Hockett|first=Charles F.|date=Oct 1948|website=The University Of Chicago Press Journals|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref> Late in his career, he was known for his stinging criticism of [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] linguistics.\n\n==Key contributions==\n\n===Criticisms of Noam Chomsky and the Generative Programme===\nAfter carefully examining the generative school's proposed innovations in Linguistics, Hockett decided that this approach was of little value. His book ''The State of the Art'' outlined his criticisms of the generative approach. In his paraphrase a key principle of the Chomskyan paradigm is that there are an infinite number of grammatical sentences in any particular language. \n<blockquote>The grammar of a language is a finite system that characterizes an infinite set of (well-formed) sentences. More specifically, the grammar of a language is a ''well-defined system'' by definition not more powerful than a universal Turing machine (and, in fact, surely a great deal weaker).<ref>''The State of the Art'', p. 40</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe crux of Hockett's rebuttal is that the set of grammatical sentences in a language is not infinite, but rather ill-defined.<ref>p. 52 et passim</ref> Hockett proposes that \"no physical system is well-defined\".<ref>p. 52</ref>\n\nLater in \"Where the tongue slips, there slip I\" he writes as follows. \n<blockquote>\nIt is currently fashionable to assume that, underlying the actual more or less bumbling speech behavior of any human being, there is a subtle and complicated but determinate linguistic \"competence\": a sentence-generating device whose design can only be roughly guessed at by any techniques so far available to us. This point of view makes linguistics very hard and very erudite, so that anyone who actually does discover facts about underlying \"competence\" is entitled to considerable kudos.\n\nWithin this popular frame of reference, a theory of \"performance\" -- of the \"generation of speech\" -- must take more or less the following form. If a sentence is to be uttered aloud, or even thought silently to oneself, it must first be built by the internal \"competence\" of the speaker, the functioning of which is by definition such that the sentence will be legal (\"grammatical\") in every respect. But that is not enough; the sentence as thus constructed must then be ''performed'', either overtly so that others may hear it, or covertly so that it is perceived only by the speaker himself. It is in this second step that blunders may appear. That which is generated by the speaker's internal \"competence\"is what the speaker \"intends to say,\" and is the only real concern of linguistics: blunders in actually performed speech are instructions from elsewhere. Just if there are no such intrusions is what is performed an instance of \"smooth speech\".\n\nI believe this view is unmitigated nonsense, unsupported by any empirical evidence of any sort. In its place, I propose the following.\n\n''All'' speech, smooth as well as blunderful, can be and must be accounted for essentially in terms of the three mechanisms we have listed: analogy, blending, and editing. An individual's language, at a given moment, is a set of habits--that is, of analogies, where different analogies are in conflict, one may appear as a constraint on the working of another. Speech actualizes habits--and changes the habits as it does so. Speech reflects awareness of norms; but norms are themselves entirely a matter of analogy (that is, of habit), not some different kind of thing.<ref>''The View From Language'', pp. 254-255.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nDespite his criticisms, Hockett always expressed gratitude to the generative school for seeing real problems in the preexisting approaches.\n\n<blockquote>There are many situations in which bracketing does not serve to disambiguate. As already noted, words that belong together cannot always be spoken together, and when they are not, bracketing is difficult or impossible. In the 1950s this drove some grammarians to drink and other to transformations, but both are only anodynes, not answers<ref>Hockett, Refurbishing our Foundations. John Benjamins, 1987, p. 23</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design features of language===\nOne of Hockett's most important contributions was his development of the [[Design Features of Language|design-feature]] approach to comparative linguistics. He attempted to distinguish the similarities and differences among [[animal communication]] systems and [[human language]].\n\nHockett initially developed seven features, which were published in the 1959 paper \u201cAnimal \u2018Languages\u2019 and Human Language.\u201d However, after many revisions, he settled on 13 design-features in the ''[[Scientific American]] '' \"The Origin of Speech.\"\n\nHockett argued that while every communication system has some of the 13 design features, only human, spoken language has all 13 features. In turn, that differentiates human spoken language from animal communication and other human communication systems such as [[written language]].\n\n====Hockett's 13 design features of language====\n{{Main|Design Features of Language}}\n#[[Vocal-Auditory Channel]]: Much of human language is performed using the [[vocal]] tract and [[auditory system|auditory]] channel. Hockett viewed this as an advantage for human [[primates]] because it allowed for the ability to participate in other activities while simultaneously communicating through spoken language.\n#[[Broadcast transmission and directional reception]]: All human language can be heard if it is within range of another person's auditory channel. Additionally, a listener has the ability to determine the source of a sound by [[binaural direction]] finding.\n#[[Rapid Fading (transitoriness)]]: Wave forms of human language dissipate over time and do not persist. A hearer can only receive specific auditory information at the time it is spoken.\n#Interchangeability: A person has the ability to speak and hear the same [[signaling theory|signal]]. Anything that a person is able to hear can be reproduced in spoken language.\n#[[Total Feedback]]: Speakers can hear themselves speak and monitor their [[speech production]] and internalize what they are producing by language.\n#Specialization: Human language sounds are specialized for communication. When dogs pant it is to cool themselves off. When humans speak, it is to transmit information.\n#[[Semanticity]]: Specific signals can be matched with a specific [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].\n#[[Arbitrariness]]: There is no limitation to what can be communicated about and no specific or necessary connection between the sounds used and the message being sent.\n#[[Discrete mathematics|Discreteness]]: [[Phonemes]] can be placed in distinct categories which differentiate them from one another, like the distinct sound of /p/ versus /b/.\n#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]]: People can refer to things in space and time and communicate about things that are not present.\n#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]: People can create new and unique meanings of utterances from previously existing utterances and sounds.\n#[[Traditional Transmission]]: Human language is not completely [[innate]], and acquisition depends in part on the learning of a language.\n#[[Duality of patterning]]: Meaningless phonic segments ([[phoneme]]s) are combined to make meaningful words, which, in turn, are combined again to make sentences.\n\nWhile Hockett believed that all communication systems, animal and human alike, share many of these features, only human language contains all 13 design features. Additionally, [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]], and [[duality of patterning]] are key to human language.\n\n====Hockett's design features and their implications for human language====\n#Vocal-Auditory Channel: Hockett suggests that the importance of a vocal-auditory channel lies in the fact that the animal can communicate while also performing other tasks, such as eating, or using tools.\n#[[Broadcast Transmission and Directional Reception]]: An auditory|audible human language signal is sent out in all directions but is perceived in a limited direction. For example, humans are more proficient in determining the location of a sound source when the sound is projecting directly in front of them, as opposed to a sound source projected directly behind them.\n#[[Rapid Fading]] of a signal in human communication differs from such things as animal tracks and written language because an utterance does not continue to exist after it has been broadcast. With that in mind, it is important to note that Hockett viewed spoken language as the primary concern for investigation. Written language was seen as being secondary because of its recent evolution in culture.\n#Interchangeability represents a human's ability to act out or reproduce any linguistic message that they are able to comprehend. That differs from many animal communication systems, particularly in regards to mating. For example, humans have the ability to say and do anything that they feel may benefit them in attracting a mate. [[Stickleback]]s, on the other hand, have different male and female courtship motions; a male cannot replicate a female's motions and vice versa.\n#[[Total Feedback]] is important in differentiating a human's ability to internalize their own productions of speech and behavior. That design-feature incorporates the idea that humans have insight into their actions.\n#Specialization is apparent in the anatomy of human [[speech organs]] and our ability to exhibit some control over these organs. For example, a key assumption in the evolution of language is that the descent of the [[larynx]] has allowed humans to produce speech sounds. Additionally, in terms of control, humans are generally able to control the movements of their tongue and mouth. Dogs however, do not have control over these organs. When dogs pant they are communicating a signal, but the panting is an uncontrollable response reflex of being hot [https://web.archive.org/web/20080709091601/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/psychology/rmk/Readings/Hockett.pdf].\n#[[Semanticity]]: A specific signal can be matched with a specific meaning within a particular language system. For example, all people who understand [[English language|English]] have the ability to make a connection between a specific word and what that word represents or refers to. (Hockett notes that [[gibbon]]s also show semanticity in their signals, but their calls are far more broad than human language.)\n#[[Arbitrariness]] within human language suggests that there is no direct connection between the type of signal (word) and what is being referenced. For example, an animal as large as a cow can be referred to by a very short word {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027014002/http://www.geocities.com/pkd_du/dfhl.htm |date=October 27, 2009 }}.\n#Discreteness: Each basic unit of speech can be categorized and is distinct from other categories. In human language, there are only a small set of sound ranges that are used and the differences between these bits of sound are absolute. In contrast, the [[waggle dance]] of [[honey bee]]s is continuous.\n#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]] refers to the human language system's ability to communicate about things that are not present spatially, temporally, or realistically. For example, humans have the ability to communicate about unicorns and outer space.\n#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]: Human language is open and productive in the sense that humans have the ability to say things that have never before been spoken or heard. In contrast, apes such as the gibbon have a closed communication system because all of their vocal sounds are part of a finite repertoire of familiar calls.\n#[[Traditional Transmission]]:: suggests that while certain aspects of [[language]] may be [[innate]], humans acquire words and their [[native language]] from other speakers. That is different from many [[animal communication]] systems because most animals are born with the [[innate]] [[knowledge]], and [[skills]] necessary for [[wiktionary:survival|survival]]. ([[Honey bee]]s have an inborn ability to perform and understand the [[waggle dance]]).\n#[[Duality of patterning]]: Humans have the ability to recombine a finite set of [[phoneme]]s to create an infinite number of words, which, in turn, can be combined to make an unlimited number of different sentences.\n\n====Design feature representation in other communication systems====\n;Honeybees\n\nForaging [[honey bee]]s communicate with other members of their hive when they have discovered a relevant source of [[pollen]], [[nectar]], or water. In an effort to convey information about the location and the distance of such resources, honeybees participate in a particular figure-eight dance known as the [[waggle dance]].\n\nIn Hockett's \"The Origin of Speech\", he determined that the honeybee communication system of the [[waggle dance]] holds the following [[Design Features of Language|design features]]:\n\n#Broadcast Transmission and Directional Reception: By the use of this dance, honeybees are able to send out a signal that informs other members of the hive as to what direction the source of food, or water can be located.\n#[[Semanticity]]: Evidence that the specific signals of a communication system can be matched with specific meanings is apparent because other members of the hive are able to locate the food source after a performance of the waggle dance.\n#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]]: Foraging honeybees can communicate about a resource that is not currently present within the hive.\n#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]: [[Waggle dance]]s change based on the direction, amount, and type of resource.\n\nGibbons are small apes in the family Hylobatidae. While they share the same [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[class (biology)|class]], and [[order (biology)|order]] of humans and are relatively close to man, Hockett distinguishes between the gibbon communication system and human language by noting that gibbons are devoid of the last four design features.\n\nGibbons possess the first nine [[Design Features of Language|design features]], but do not possess the last four (displacement, productivity, [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]], and [[duality of patterning]]).\n\n#Displacement, according to Hockett, appears to be lacking in the vocal [[Signalling theory|signal]]ing of apes.\n#Productivity does not exist among gibbons because if any vocal sound is produced, it is one of a finite set of repetitive and familiar calls.\n#Hockett supports the idea that humans learn language extra genetically through the process of [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]]. Hockett distinguishes gibbons from humans by stating that despite any similarities in communication among a species of apes, one cannot attribute these similarities to acquisition through the teaching and learning ([[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]]) of signals; the only explanation must be a genetic basis.\n#Finally, [[duality of patterning]] explains a human's ability to create multiple [[meanings (linguistics)|meanings]] from somewhat meaningless sounds. For example, the [[phonemes]]s /t/, /a/, /c/ can be used to create the words \"cat,\" \"tack,\" and \"act.\" Hockett states that no other [[Hominoid]] communication system besides human language maintains this ability.\n\n===Later additions to the features===\nIn a report published in 1968 with anthropologist and scientist Stuart A. Altmann, Hockett derived three more [[Design Features of Language|Design Features]], bringing the total to 16. These are the additional three:\n\n#<li value=14> '''[[Deception|Prevarication]]''': A speaker can say falsehoods, lies, and meaningless statements.\n# '''Reflexiveness''': Language can be used communicate about the very system it is, and language can discuss language\n# '''[[Learnability]]''': A speaker of a language can learn another language\n\n====Other additions====\nCognitive scientist and linguist at the University of Sussex [[Larry Trask]] offered an alternative term and definition for number 14, '''[[Deception|Prevarication]]''':\n:14. (a) '''Stimulus Freedom''': One can choose to say anything nothing in any given situation\n\nThere has since been one more Feature added to the list, by [https://web.archive.org/web/20100612132306/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/anth/People/FacStaff/faculty/wstuart/index.html Dr. William Taft Stuart], a director of the Undergraduate Studies program at the University of Maryland: College Park's Anthropology school, part of the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences. His \u201cextra\u201d Feature is:\n\n:17. '''Grammaticality''': A speaker\u2019s sayings conform to the rules of grammar\n\nThis follows the definition of Grammar and Syntax, as given by Merriam-Webster's Dictionary:\n\n:'''[[Grammar]]''':\n::1. (a) the study of the classes of words, their inflections, and their functions and relations in the sentence (b) a study of what is to be preferred and what avoided in inflection and syntax\n\n::2. (a) the characteristic system of inflections and syntax of a language (b) a system of rules that defines the grammatical structure of a language\n\n:'''[[Syntax]]''':\n::1. (a) the way in which linguistic elements (as words) are put together to form constituents (as phrases or clauses) (b) the part of grammar\n\n====Relationship between design features and animal communication====\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Stuart defends his postulation with references to famous linguist Noam Chomsky and University of New York psychologist Gary Marcus. Chomsky theorized that humans are unique in the animal world because of their ability to utilize Design Feature 5: Total Feedback, or recursive grammar. This includes being able to correct oneself and insert explanatory or even non sequitur statements into a sentence, without breaking stride, and keeping proper grammar throughout.\n\nWhile there have been studies attempting to disprove Chomsky, Marcus states that, \"An intriguing possibility is that the capacity to recognize recursion might be found only in species that can acquire new patterns of vocalization, for example, songbirds, humans and perhaps some cetaceans.\" This is in response to a [http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2006/04/26/birds-grammar060426.html study performed] by psychologist Timothy Gentner of the University of California at San Diego. Gentner's study found that starling songbirds use recursive grammar to identify \u201codd\u201d statements within a given \u201csong.\u201d However, the study does not necessarily debunk Chomsky's observation because it has not yet been proven that songbirds have the semantic ability to generalize from patterns.\n\n[http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~johnson/articles.chimp.html There is also thought] that symbolic thought is necessary for grammar-based speech, and thus Homo Erectus and all preceding \u201chumans\u201d would have been unable to comprehend modern speech. Rather, their utterances would have been halting and even quite confusing to us, \ntoday.\n\n=====Hockett's \"design features\" of language and other animal communication systems=====\n\nThe [http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/jcoleman/design_features.htm [[University of Oxford]]]: Phonetics Laboratory Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics published the following chart, detailing how Hockett's (and Altmann's) Design Features fit into other forms of communication, in animals:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He represents the post-[[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfieldian]] phase of [[structuralism (linguistics)|structuralism]] often referred to as \"[[distributionalism]]\" or \"taxonomic structuralism\". His academic career spanned over half a century at Cornell and Rice universities. Hockett was also a firm believer of linguistics as a branch of anthropology, making contributions that were significant to the field of anthropology as well.\n\n==Professional and academic career <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/hockett-charles.pdf|title=National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir|last=Gair|first=James W.|date=2006|website=National Academy of Sciences online|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>==\n\n===Education===\nAt the age of 16, Hockett enrolled at [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Master of Arts]] in [[ancient history]]. While enrolled at [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], Hockett became interested in the work of [[Leonard Bloomfield]], a leading figure in the field of [[structural linguistics]]. Hockett continued his education at [[Yale University]] where he studied [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] and received his [[doctor of philosophy|PhD]] in anthropology in 1939. While studying at Yale, Hockett studied with several other influential linguists such as [[Edward Sapir]], [[George P. Murdock]], and [[Benjamin Whorf]]. Hockett's dissertation was based on his fieldwork in [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]]; his paper on Potawatomi [[syntax]] was published in ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'' in 1939. In 1948 his [[dissertation]] was published as a series in the [[International Journal of American Linguistics]]. Following fieldwork in [[Kickapoo language|Kickapoo]] and [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Mexico]], Hockett did two years of [[postdoctoral]] study with [[Leonard Bloomfield]] in [[Chicago]] and [[Michigan]].\n\n===Career===\nHockett began his teaching career in 1946 as an assistant professor of linguistics in the Division of [[Modern Languages]] at [[Cornell University]] where he was responsible for directing the [[Chinese language]] program. In 1957, Hockett became a member of Cornell's anthropology department and continued to teach anthropology and linguistics until he retired to [[emeritus|emeritus status]] in 1982. In 1986, he took up an adjunct post at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston, Texas]], where he remained active until his death in 2000.\n\n===Achievements===\nCharles Hockett held membership among many academic institutions such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[Society of Fellows]] at [[Harvard University]]. He served as president of both the [[Linguistic Society of America]] and the Linguistic Association of Canada and the United States.\n\nIn addition to making many contributions to the field of [[structural linguistics]], Hockett also considered such things as [[Benjamin Whorf|Whorfian Theory]], [[jokes]], the nature of [[writing systems]], slips of the tongue, and [[animal communication]] and their relativeness to [[speech]].\n\nOutside the realm of linguistics and anthropology, Hockett practiced [[Musical theatre|musical]] performance and [[Musical composition|composition]]. Hockett composed a full-length [[opera]] called ''The Love of Do\u00f1a Rosita'' which was based on a play by [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] and premiered at [[Ithaca College]] by the [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] [[Opera]].\n\nHockett and his wife Shirley were vital leaders in the development of the [[Cayuga, New York|Cayuga]] Chamber Orchestra in Ithaca, New York. In appreciation of the Hocketts' hard work and dedication to the Ithaca community, Ithaca College established the Charles F. Hockett Music Scholarship, the Shirley and Chas Hockett Chamber Music Concert Series, and the Hockett Family Recital Hall.\n\n==View on linguistics==\nIn his paper \"A Note on Structure\", he proposes that [[linguistics]] can be seen as \"a game and as a science.\" A linguist as a player in the game of langauges has the freedom to experiment on all utterances of a language, but must ensure that \"all the utterances of the corpus must be taken into account.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/doi/abs/10.1086/464015|title=A Note on 'Structure' [Review of de Goeje by W. D. Preston]|last=Hockett|first=Charles F.|date=Oct 1948|website=The University Of Chicago Press Journals|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref> Late in his career, he was known for his stinging criticism of [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] linguistics.\n\n==Key contributions==\n\n===Criticisms of Noam Chomsky and the Generative Programme===\nAfter carefully examining the generative school's proposed innovations in Linguistics, Hockett decided that this approach was of little value. His book ''The State of the Art'' outlined his criticisms of the generative approach. In his paraphrase a key principle of the Chomskyan paradigm is that there are an infinite number of grammatical sentences in any particular language. \n<blockquote>The grammar of a language is a finite system that characterizes an infinite set of (well-formed) sentences. More specifically, the grammar of a language is a ''well-defined system'' by definition not more powerful than a universal Turing machine (and, in fact, surely a great deal weaker).<ref>''The State of the Art'', p. 40</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe crux of Hockett's rebuttal is that the set of grammatical sentences in a language is not infinite, but rather ill-defined.<ref>p. 52 et passim</ref> Hockett proposes that \"no physical system is well-defined\".<ref>p. 52</ref>\n\nLater in \"Where the tongue slips, there slip I\" he writes as follows. \n<blockquote>\nIt is currently fashionable to assume that, underlying the actual more or less bumbling speech behavior of any human being, there is a subtle and complicated but determinate linguistic \"competence\": a sentence-generating device whose design can only be roughly guessed at by any techniques so far available to us. This point of view makes linguistics very hard and very erudite, so that anyone who actually does discover facts about underlying \"competence\" is entitled to considerable kudos.\n\nWithin this popular frame of reference, a theory of \"performance\" -- of the \"generation of speech\" -- must take more or less the following form. If a sentence is to be uttered aloud, or even thought silently to oneself, it must first be built by the internal \"competence\" of the speaker, the functioning of which is by definition such that the sentence will be legal (\"grammatical\") in every respect. But that is not enough; the sentence as thus constructed must then be ''performed'', either overtly so that others may hear it, or covertly so that it is perceived only by the speaker himself. It is in this second step that blunders may appear. That which is generated by the speaker's internal \"competence\"is what the speaker \"intends to say,\" and is the only real concern of linguistics: blunders in actually performed speech are instructions from elsewhere. Just if there are no such intrusions is what is performed an instance of \"smooth speech\".\n\nI believe this view is unmitigated nonsense, unsupported by any empirical evidence of any sort. In its place, I propose the following.\n\n''All'' speech, smooth as well as blunderful, can be and must be accounted for essentially in terms of the three mechanisms we have listed: analogy, blending, and editing. An individual's language, at a given moment, is a set of habits--that is, of analogies, where different analogies are in conflict, one may appear as a constraint on the working of another. Speech actualizes habits--and changes the habits as it does so. Speech reflects awareness of norms; but norms are themselves entirely a matter of analogy (that is, of habit), not some different kind of thing.<ref>''The View From Language'', pp. 254-255.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nDespite his criticisms, Hockett always expressed gratitude to the generative school for seeing real problems in the preexisting approaches.\n\n<blockquote>There are many situations in which bracketing does not serve to disambiguate. As already noted, words that belong together cannot always be spoken together, and when they are not, bracketing is difficult or impossible. In the 1950s this drove some grammarians to drink and other to transformations, but both are only anodynes, not answers<ref>Hockett, Refurbishing our Foundations. John Benjamins, 1987, p. 23</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design features of language===\nOne of Hockett's most important contributions was his development of the [[Design Features of Language|design-feature]] approach to comparative linguistics. He attempted to distinguish the similarities and differences among [[animal communication]] systems and [[human language]].\n\nHockett initially developed seven features, which were published in the 1959 paper \u201cAnimal \u2018Languages\u2019 and Human Language.\u201d However, after many revisions, he settled on 13 design-features in the ''[[Scientific American]] '' \"The Origin of Speech.\"\n\nHockett argued that while every communication system has some of the 13 design features, only human, spoken language has all 13 features. In turn, that differentiates human spoken language from animal communication and other human communication systems such as [[written language]].\n\n====Hockett's 13 design features of language====\n{{Main|Design Features of Language}}\n#[[Vocal-Auditory Channel]]: Much of human language is performed using the [[vocal]] tract and [[auditory system|auditory]] channel. Hockett viewed this as an advantage for human [[primates]] because it allowed for the ability to participate in other activities while simultaneously communicating through spoken language.\n#[[Broadcast transmission and directional reception]]: All human language can be heard if it is within range of another person's auditory channel. Additionally, a listener has the ability to determine the source of a sound by [[binaural direction]] finding.\n#[[Rapid Fading (transitoriness)]]: Wave forms of human language dissipate over time and do not persist. A hearer can only receive specific auditory information at the time it is spoken.\n#Interchangeability: A person has the ability to speak and hear the same [[signaling theory|signal]]. Anything that a person is able to hear can be reproduced in spoken language.\n#[[Total Feedback]]: Speakers can hear themselves speak and monitor their [[speech production]] and internalize what they are producing by language.\n#Specialization: Human language sounds are specialized for communication. When dogs pant it is to cool themselves off. When humans speak, it is to transmit information.\n#[[Semanticity]]: Specific signals can be matched with a specific [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].\n#[[Arbitrariness]]: There is no limitation to what can be communicated about and no specific or necessary connection between the sounds used and the message being sent.\n#[[Discrete mathematics|Discreteness]]: [[Phonemes]] can be placed in distinct categories which differentiate them from one another, like the distinct sound of /p/ versus /b/.\n#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]]: People can refer to things in space and time and communicate about things that are not present.\n#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]: People can create new and unique meanings of utterances from previously existing utterances and sounds.\n#[[Traditional Transmission]]: Human language is not completely [[innate]], and acquisition depends in part on the learning of a language.\n#[[Duality of patterning]]: Meaningless phonic segments ([[phoneme]]s) are combined to make meaningful words, which, in turn, are combined again to make sentences.\n\nWhile Hockett believed that all communication systems, animal and human alike, share many of these features, only human language contains all 13 design features. Additionally, [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]], and [[duality of patterning]] are key to human language.\n\n====Hockett's design features and their implications for human language====\n#Hockett suggests that the importance of a vocal-auditory channel lies in the fact that the animal can communicate while also performing other tasks, such as eating, or using tools.\n#[[Broadcast Transmission and Directional Reception]]: An auditory|audible human language signal is sent out in all directions but is perceived in a limited direction. For example, humans are more proficient in determining the location of a sound source when the sound is projecting directly in front of them, as opposed to a sound source projected directly behind them.\n#[[Rapid Fading]] of a signal in human communication differs from such things as animal tracks and written language because an utterance does not continue to exist after it has been broadcast. With that in mind, it is important to note that Hockett viewed spoken language as the primary concern for investigation. Written language was seen as being secondary because of its recent evolution in culture.\n#Interchangeability represents a human's ability to act out or reproduce any linguistic message that they are able to comprehend. That differs from many animal communication systems, particularly in regards to mating. For example, humans have the ability to say and do anything that they feel may benefit them in attracting a mate. [[Stickleback]]s, on the other hand, have different male and female courtship motions; a male cannot replicate a female's motions and vice versa.\n#[[Total Feedback]] is important in differentiating a human's ability to internalize their own productions of speech and behavior. That design-feature incorporates the idea that humans have insight into their actions.\n#Specialization is apparent in the anatomy of human [[speech organs]] and our ability to exhibit some control over these organs. For example, a key assumption in the evolution of language is that the descent of the [[larynx]] has allowed humans to produce speech sounds. Additionally, in terms of control, humans are generally able to control the movements of their tongue and mouth. Dogs however, do not have control over these organs. When dogs pant they are communicating a signal, but the panting is an uncontrollable response reflex of being hot [https://web.archive.org/web/20080709091601/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/psychology/rmk/Readings/Hockett.pdf].\n#[[Semanticity]]: A specific signal can be matched with a specific meaning within a particular language system. For example, all people who understand [[English language|English]] have the ability to make a connection between a specific word and what that word represents or refers to. (Hockett notes that [[gibbon]]s also show semanticity in their signals, but their calls are far more broad than human language.)\n#[[Arbitrariness]] within human language suggests that there is no direct connection between the type of signal (word) and what is being referenced. For example, an animal as large as a cow can be referred to by a very short word {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027014002/http://www.geocities.com/pkd_du/dfhl.htm |date=October 27, 2009 }}.\n#Discreteness: Each basic unit of speech can be categorized and is distinct from other categories. In human language, there are only a small set of sound ranges that are used and the differences between these bits of sound are absolute. In contrast, the [[waggle dance]] of [[honey bee]]s is continuous.\n#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]] refers to the human language system's ability to communicate about things that are not present spatially, temporally, or realistically. For example, humans have the ability to communicate about unicorns and outer space.\n#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]: Human language is open and productive in the sense that humans have the ability to say things that have never before been spoken or heard. In contrast, apes such as the gibbon have a closed communication system because all of their vocal sounds are part of a finite repertoire of familiar calls.\n#[[Traditional Transmission]]:: suggests that while certain aspects of [[language]] may be [[innate]], humans acquire words and their [[native language]] from other speakers. That is different from many [[animal communication]] systems because most animals are born with the [[innate]] [[knowledge]], and [[skills]] necessary for [[wiktionary:survival|survival]]. ([[Honey bee]]s have an inborn ability to perform and understand the [[waggle dance]]).\n#[[Duality of patterning]]: Humans have the ability to recombine a finite set of [[phoneme]]s to create an infinite number of words, which, in turn, can be combined to make an unlimited number of different sentences.\n\n====Design feature representation in other communication systems====\n;Honeybees\n\nForaging [[honey bee]]s communicate with other members of their hive when they have discovered a relevant source of [[pollen]], [[nectar]], or water. In an effort to convey information about the location and the distance of such resources, honeybees participate in a particular figure-eight dance known as the [[waggle dance]].\n\nIn Hockett's \"The Origin of Speech\", he determined that the honeybee communication system of the [[waggle dance]] holds the following [[Design Features of Language|design features]]:\n\n#Broadcast Transmission and Directional Reception: By the use of this dance, honeybees are able to send out a signal that informs other members of the hive as to what direction the source of food, or water can be located.\n#[[Semanticity]]: Evidence that the specific signals of a communication system can be matched with specific meanings is apparent because other members of the hive are able to locate the food source after a performance of the waggle dance.\n#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]]: Foraging honeybees can communicate about a resource that is not currently present within the hive.\n#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]: [[Waggle dance]]s change based on the direction, amount, and type of resource.\n\nGibbons are small apes in the family Hylobatidae. While they share the same [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[class (biology)|class]], and [[order (biology)|order]] of humans and are relatively close to man, Hockett distinguishes between the gibbon communication system and human language by noting that gibbons are devoid of the last four design features.\n\nGibbons possess the first nine [[Design Features of Language|design features]], but do not possess the last four (displacement, productivity, [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]], and [[duality of patterning]]).\n\n#Displacement, according to Hockett, appears to be lacking in the vocal [[Signalling theory|signal]]ing of apes.\n#Productivity does not exist among gibbons because if any vocal sound is produced, it is one of a finite set of repetitive and familiar calls.\n#Hockett supports the idea that humans learn language extra genetically through the process of [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]]. Hockett distinguishes gibbons from humans by stating that despite any similarities in communication among a species of apes, one cannot attribute these similarities to acquisition through the teaching and learning ([[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]]) of signals; the only explanation must be a genetic basis.\n#Finally, [[duality of patterning]] explains a human's ability to create multiple [[meanings (linguistics)|meanings]] from somewhat meaningless sounds. For example, the [[phonemes]]s /t/, /a/, /c/ can be used to create the words \"cat,\" \"tack,\" and \"act.\" Hockett states that no other [[Hominoid]] communication system besides human language maintains this ability.\n\n===Later additions to the features===\nIn a report published in 1968 with anthropologist and scientist Stuart A. Altmann, Hockett derived three more [[Design Features of Language|Design Features]], bringing the total to 16. These are the additional three:\n\n#<li value=14> '''[[Deception|Prevarication]]''': A speaker can say falsehoods, lies, and meaningless statements.\n# '''Reflexiveness''': Language can be used communicate about the very system it is, and language can discuss language\n# '''[[Learnability]]''': A speaker of a language can learn another language\n\n====Other additions====\nCognitive scientist and linguist at the University of Sussex [[Larry Trask]] offered an alternative term and definition for number 14, '''[[Deception|Prevarication]]''':\n:14. (a) '''Stimulus Freedom''': One can choose to say anything nothing in any given situation\n\nThere has since been one more Feature added to the list, by [https://web.archive.org/web/20100612132306/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/anth/People/FacStaff/faculty/wstuart/index.html Dr. William Taft Stuart], a director of the Undergraduate Studies program at the University of Maryland: College Park's Anthropology school, part of the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences. His \u201cextra\u201d Feature is:\n\n:17. '''Grammaticality''': A speaker\u2019s sayings conform to the rules of grammar\n\nThis follows the definition of Grammar and Syntax, as given by Merriam-Webster's Dictionary:\n\n:'''[[Grammar]]''':\n::1. (a) the study of the classes of words, their inflections, and their functions and relations in the sentence (b) a study of what is to be preferred and what avoided in inflection and syntax\n\n::2. (a) the characteristic system of inflections and syntax of a language (b) a system of rules that defines the grammatical structure of a language\n\n:'''[[Syntax]]''':\n::1. (a) the way in which linguistic elements (as words) are put together to form constituents (as phrases or clauses) (b) the part of grammar\n\n====Relationship between design features and animal communication====\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Stuart defends his postulation with references to famous linguist Noam Chomsky and University of New York psychologist Gary Marcus. Chomsky theorized that humans are unique in the animal world because of their ability to utilize Design Feature 5: Total Feedback, or recursive grammar. This includes being able to correct oneself and insert explanatory or even non sequitur statements into a sentence, without breaking stride, and keeping proper grammar throughout.\n\nWhile there have been studies attempting to disprove Chomsky, Marcus states that, \"An intriguing possibility is that the capacity to recognize recursion might be found only in species that can acquire new patterns of vocalization, for example, songbirds, humans and perhaps some cetaceans.\" This is in response to a [http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2006/04/26/birds-grammar060426.html study performed] by psychologist Timothy Gentner of the University of California at San Diego. Gentner's study found that starling songbirds use recursive grammar to identify \u201codd\u201d statements within a given \u201csong.\u201d However, the study does not necessarily debunk Chomsky's observation because it has not yet been proven that songbirds have the semantic ability to generalize from patterns.\n\n[http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~johnson/articles.chimp.html There is also thought] that symbolic thought is necessary for grammar-based speech, and thus Homo Erectus and all preceding \u201chumans\u201d would have been unable to comprehend modern speech. Rather, their utterances would have been halting and even quite confusing to us, \ntoday.\n\n=====Hockett's \"design features\" of language and other animal communication systems=====\n\nThe [http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/jcoleman/design_features.htm [[University of Oxford]]]: Phonetics Laboratory Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics published the following chart, detailing how Hockett's (and Altmann's) Design Features fit into other forms of communication, in animals:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The court held that such wide restrictions of basic rights may be adopted only under the Crisis Act by the Government as whole and not by Ministry of Health alone.

The court held that such wide restrictions of basic rights may be adopted only under the Crisis Act by the Government as whole and not by Ministry of Health alone.

Many critics described his music as operatic, nicknaming him \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] of Rock\" and \"the Big O\". Most male rock-and-roll performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, while many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability. He performed standing still, wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses.\n\nOrbison began singing in a [[rockabilly]] and [[Country music|country-and-western]] band in high school. He was contracted by [[Sam Phillips]] of [[Sun Records]] in 1956, but his greatest success came with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of his singles reached the ''Billboard'' Top 40, and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10, including \"[[Only the Lonely]]\" (1960), \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\" (1961), \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" (1961), \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (1963), and \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" (1964). Soon afterward, he was struck by a number of personal tragedies while his record sales declined.\n\nIn the 1980s, Orbison experienced a resurgence in popularity following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he co-founded the [[Traveling Wilburys]], a rock supergroup with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison died of a heart attack in December 1988 at age 52. One month later, his song \"[[You Got It]]\" (1989) was released as a solo single and became his first hit to reach the U.S. Top 10 in nearly 25 years.\n\nOrbison's honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in the same year, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2014. ''Rolling Stone'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed him at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\nOrbison was born on April 23, 1936 in [[Vernon, Texas]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carr|first=Joe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&pg=RA10-PP22|title=Prairie Nights to Neon Lights: The Story of Country Music in West Texas|last2=Munde|first2=Alan|date=October 1996|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|isbn=978-0-89672-365-8|pages=134|language=en}}</ref> the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison (1913\u20131984), an oil well driller and car mechanic, and nurse Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 \u2013 May 12, 1992).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Nadine-Orbison/6000000012909498491 |title=Nadine Vesta Orbison |website=geni}}</ref> The family moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] in 1942 to find work in the aircraft factories.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|last=Orbison|first=Alex|publisher=Center Street|others=Orbison, Wesley,, Orbison, Roy Jr., Slate, Jeff,, Riesco, Marcel|year=2017|isbn=9781478976547|edition= Second|location=New York|pages=28|oclc=1017566749}}</ref>\n\nRoy attended Denver Avenue Elementary School<ref name=\":0\" /> until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon, and they moved again to [[Wink, Texas]] in 1946.

The song was released on Sun 242 in May 1956{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and broke into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> The Teen Kings toured with [[Sonny James]], [[Johnny Horton]], Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing \"everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record\".<ref>Clayson, Alan p. 44.</ref> The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including \"[[Go Go Go (Down the Line)|Go! Go! Go!]]\" and \"Rockhouse\". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there.{{efn|Alan Clayson's biography refers to her as Claudette Hestand.}} They stayed in Phillips' home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice.<ref>Amburn, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> A ballad Orbison wrote, \"The Clown\", met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer [[Jack Clement]] told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 45.</ref>\n\nOrbison was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, once going to pick up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison wrote \"Claudette\"\u2014about Claudette Frady, whom he married in 1957\u2014and the [[Everly Brothers]] recorded it as the B-side of \"[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]\". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 56.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period in the late 1950s, Orbison made his living at [[Acuff-Rose Music|Acuff-Rose]], a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to [[Wesley Rose]], who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison attempted to sell to [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] his recordings of songs by other writers, working with and being in awe of [[Chet Atkins]], who had played guitar with Presley. One song he tried was \"Seems to Me\", by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant|Boudleaux Bryant]]. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of \"a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then\u2014softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 62.</ref>\n\nPlaying shows at night and living with his wife and young child in a tiny apartment, Orbison often took his guitar to his car to write songs. The songwriter [[Joe Melson]], an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to write some songs together.<ref>Clayson, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs at [[RCA Studio B|RCA Nashville]]. Only two singles were judged worthy of release by RCA.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\">Zak, p. 32.</ref> Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer [[Fred Foster]] at [[Monument Records]].\n\n== 1960\u201364: Monument Records ==\n===Early singles===\nOrbison was one of the first recording artists to popularize the \"[[Nashville sound]]\", with a group of session musicians known as the [[The Nashville A-Team|A-Team (see main entry)]] The Nashville sound was developed by producers Chet Atkins, [[Owen Bradley]] (who worked closely with [[Patsy Cline]]), Sam Phillips, and Fred Foster.<ref>Wolfe and Akenson, p. 24.</ref><ref>Hoffmann and Ferstler, p. 779.</ref> In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA had refused, \"Paper Boy\", backed by \"With the Bug\", but neither charted.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\">Zak, p. 33.</ref>\n\nAccording to musician and author Albin Zak, the studio (with sound engineer [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], who experimented with [[Microphone practice|close miking]] the [[doo-wop]] backing singers), the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison's music a \"polished, professional sound&nbsp;... finally allow[ing] Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein\".<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\"/> Orbison requested a string section and with it, he recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was \"Uptown\", written with Joe Melson.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\">Lehman, p. 48.</ref> Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, \"We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/><ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'' states that the music Orbison made in Nashville \"brought a new splendor to rock\", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of [[Phil Spector]].<ref name=decurtis155>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 155.</ref>\n\n\"Uptown\" reached only number 72 on the ''Billboard'' Top 100, and Orbison set his sights on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere. His initial success came just as the '50s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.<ref>Lehman, p. 19.</ref>\n\n===Top-10 hits===\n====1960\u201362====\n\nExperimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from \"Uptown\", and another song they had written called \"Come Back to Me (My Love)\", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\">Zak, p. 35.</ref> It also featured a note hit by Orbison in [[falsetto]] that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, \"came not from his throat but deeper within\".<ref>Clayson, p. 77.</ref> The song was \"[[Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)]]\". Orbison and Melson tried to pitch it to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, but were turned down.<ref>Amburn p. 91.</ref> They instead recorded the song at RCA's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\"/><ref name=Fremer>{{cite interview |interviewer=Michael Fremer |last=Porter |first=Bill |date=January 1, 2006 |url=http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |title=Recording Elvis and Roy With Legendary Studio Wiz Bill Porter \u2013 Part II |website=MusicAngle |access-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714134327/http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |archive-date=July 14, 2011}}</ref> This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\"/>\n\n\"Only the Lonely\" shot to number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1988, \"I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Only the Lonely\", it kind of turned into a good voice.\"<ref name=\"rockhall\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/roy-orbison |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> Its success transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' out of New York City.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=78}} When Presley heard \"Only the Lonely\" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.<ref name=\"amburn98\">Amburn, p. 98.</ref> Melson and Orbison followed it with the more complex \"Blue Angel\", which peaked at number nine in the US and number 11 in the UK. \"I'm Hurtin'\", with \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" as the B-side, rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Running Scared.ogg\n|title=\"Running Scared\" (1961)\n|description=The ending of \"Running Scared\" features Orbison's natural voice hitting high A natural.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison was now able to move to Nashville permanently with his wife Claudette and two sons Roy DeWayne and Anthony King.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of \"Only the Lonely\" and \"I'm Hurtin'\", Orbison worked on a new song, \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\", based loosely on the rhythm of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]''; the song was about a man on the lookout for his girlfriend's previous boyfriend, whom he feared would try to take her away. Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.<ref name=decurtis155/> On that third take, \"Running Scared\" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, \"He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> Just weeks later \"Running Scared\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected \"Running Scared\": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n\"Crying\" followed in July 1961 and reached number two; it was coupled with an up-tempo R&B song, \"Candy Man\", written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 30, staying on the charts for two months.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as \"The Big O\", partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with \"[[Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)]]\", an upbeat song by country songwriter [[Cindy Walker]]. (Orbison's producer later formed [[the Candymen]] quintet, which was Orbison's backing band from 1965 to 1970 and released a few singles and two albums of its own). Also in 1962, he charted with \"The Crowd\", \"Leah\", and \"Workin' for the Man\", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref>Amburn, p. 32.</ref> His relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 91.</ref>\n\n====1963\u201364====\n[[File:1965 Roy Orbison.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Orbison began performing while wearing sunglasses in 1963, later recalling that he \"wasn't trying to be weird ...

He had no publicist in the early 1960s, therefore he had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' called him an \"anonymous celebrity\".<ref>Lehman, p. 18.</ref> After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an aeroplane in 1963, while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had a good sense of humor and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe [[stage fright]]; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat.

Orbison finished 1963 with a Christmas song written by [[Willie Nelson]], \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" (US number 15 in 1963, UK number six in 1964).\n\nAs \"In Dreams\" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace [[Duane Eddy]] on a tour of the UK in top billing with the [[the Beatles|Beatles]]. When he arrived in Britain, however, he realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of the Beatles, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, \"What's a Beatle, anyway?\" to which [[John Lennon]] replied, after tapping his shoulder, \"I am\".<ref>Amburn, p. 115.</ref> On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. The Beatles stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison sang through 14 encores.<ref name=\"clayson109-113\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 109\u2013113.</ref> Finally, when the audience began chanting \"We want Roy!\" again, Lennon and McCartney physically held Orbison back.<ref>Amburn, p. 117.</ref> Starr later said, \"In [[Glasgow]], we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything.\"<ref name=\"clayson109-113\"/> Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work.<ref>Lennon, John; McCartney, Paul; Harrison, George; Starr, Ringo (2002). ''The Beatles Anthology. Chronicle''. p. 94</ref> Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.\n\nTouring in 1963 took a toll on Orbison's personal life. His wife Claudette had an affair with the contractor who built their home in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. Friends and relatives attributed the breakdown of the marriage to her youth and her inability to withstand being alone and bored. When Orbison toured Britain again in the fall of 1963, she joined him.<ref>Amburn, pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> He was immensely popular wherever he went, finishing the tour in Ireland and Canada. Almost immediately, he toured Australia and New Zealand with [[the Beach Boys]] and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him.<ref>Amburn, p. 125.</ref> He travelled to Australia again, this time with [[the Rolling Stones]]. [[Mick Jagger]] later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, \"a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was.\"<ref name=\"amburn134\">Amburn, p. 134.</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Oh, Pretty Woman.ogg\n|title=\"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (1964)\n|description=The opening guitar riff of \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was a direct influence on \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" by the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]].<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 128 and Lehman, p. 169.</ref>\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison also began collaborating with [[Bill Dees]], whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote \"[[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|It's Over]]\", a number-one hit in the UK and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, \"A pretty woman never needs any money\".<ref>Amburn, p. 127.</ref> Just 40 minutes later, \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a [[Bob Hope]] movie, the epithet ''mercy'' Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as ''Billboard'' magazine noted, \"In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the ''only'' American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964.

Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM.

Claudette traveled to England to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=129}}\n\nOrbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot.<ref>Amburn, p. 126.</ref>\n\nOrbison and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles; she had grown up around them, but he claimed Elvis Presley had introduced him to motorcycles.<ref>Amburn, p. 54.</ref> Tragedy struck on June 6, 1966, however, when Orbison and Claudette were riding home from [[Bristol, Tennessee]]. She struck the door of a pickup truck which had pulled out in front of her on South Water Avenue in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]], and died instantly.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 139.</ref>\n\nA grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with [[Bill Dees]] to write music for ''[[The Fastest Guitar Alive]]'', a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy.<ref>Lehman, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> Orbison's character was a spy who stole, and had to protect and deliver, a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]], and was outfitted with a guitar that turned into a rifle.

During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[the Doors]], Orbison felt lost and directionless, later saying: \"[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 152.</ref>\n\nDuring a tour of England and playing [[Birmingham]] on Saturday, September 14, 1968,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=144}} he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 161\u201363.</ref> The property was sold to [[Johnny Cash]], who demolished the building and planted an orchard on it.

Aside from a few minor hits in Australia, he also failed to produce any charting singles after the 1960s. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents and several of his 1970s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records.<ref>Amburn, p. 170.</ref> Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: \"Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 2.</ref> His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released covers of his songs, which proved popular. Orbison's version of \"[[Love Hurts]]\", a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers, was remade by [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], again by [[Hard Rock music|hard rock]] band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and by [[blues]] adept [[Jim Capaldi]]. [[Sonny James]] sent \"Only the Lonely\" to No. 1 on the country music charts.<ref>Amburn, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> [[Bruce Springsteen]] ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and [[Glen Campbell]] had a minor hit with a remake of \"Dream Baby\".\n\nA compilation of Orbison's greatest hits went to No. 1 in the UK in January 1976. The same year, he began to open concerts for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], who started as [[Linda Ronstadt|Linda Ronstadt's]] backup band. Ronstadt herself covered \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" in 1977, her version reaching No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career.<ref>Amburn, p. 178.</ref> He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded \"[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]\" with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.\n\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|Orbison with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis for a televised 1977 Christmas special]]\n\nIn late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to overwinter in [[Hawaii]].

He had suffered from [[Peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcers]] since as early as 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 3, 183\u2013184.</ref> He felt revitalized following the triple bypass, but he continued to smoke, and his weight fluctuated for the remainder of his life.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1980, [[Don McLean]] charted with \"Crying\"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and his version unexpectedly went to the top of the charts at first in the Netherlands, afterward hitting No. 5 in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was No. 1 in the UK for three weeks, and also topped the Irish Charts.<ref>Amburn, p. 182.</ref> Although he was all but forgotten in the US, Orbison reached the most unlikely places for a rock and roll legend, like [[Bulgaria]] for example in 1982.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964; he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of [[Sofia]].<ref>Amburn, p. 183.</ref> In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris had won a [[Grammy Award]] for their duet \"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\" (from the comedy film ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'', in which Orbison also had a cameo role) and things were picking up.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}} It was his first such award, and he felt hopeful in making a full return to popular music.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 192.</ref> However, it would be several more years until this came to fruition. In the meantime, [[Van Halen]] released a hard-rock cover of \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" on their 1982 album ''[[Diver Down]]'', again further exposing a younger generation to Orbison's legacy.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}}\n\n=== Career revival ===\n\n[[File:Orbison1987.jpg|thumb|left|Orbison performing in New York in 1987]]\n\nOrbison originally declined [[David Lynch]]'s request to allow the use of \"In Dreams\" for the film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986).<ref>Amburn, p. 191.</ref> Lynch used it anyway (although his first choice was \"Crying\"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=199}}); the song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] (played by  [[Dennis Hopper]]). It was lip-synched by an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] drug dealer played by [[Dean Stockwell]], after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere.<ref name=\"Amburn, p. 193\">Amburn, p. 193.</ref> Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, \"I was mortified because they were talking about the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal&nbsp;... I thought, 'What in the world&nbsp;...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie\u2014how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/>\n\nBy 1987, Orbison's career was fully revived. He released an album of his re-recorded hits, titled ''[[In Dreams: The Greatest Hits]]''. \"Life Fades Away\", a song he co-wrote with his friend [[Glenn Danzig]] and recorded, was featured in the film ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |title=Glenn Danzig and Roy Orbison |publisher=RoyOrbison.com |accessdate=July 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224630/http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df= }}</ref> He and [[k.d. lang]] performed a duet of \"Crying\" for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Hiding Out]]'' (1987); the pair received a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] after Orbison's death.<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/roy-orbison |title=GRAMMY Award Results for Roy Orbison |website=Recording Academy GRAMMY Awards |access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1987, Orbison was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and was initiated into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album ''[[Born to Run]]'': \"I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector\u2014but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison.\"<ref name=\"clayson202-203\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 202\u2013203.</ref> In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt \"validated\" by the honor.<ref name=\"clayson202-203\"/> A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove nightclub]] in Los Angeles. They were joined by [[Jackson Browne]], [[T Bone Burnett]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[James Burton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.james-burton.net/biography/ |title=Biography |website=The Official James Burton Website |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref> and [[k.d. lang]]. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: \"Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 207.</ref> The concert was filmed in one take and aired on [[Cinemax]] under the title ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night]]''; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.<ref>Amburn, p. 205.</ref>\n\n===Traveling Wilburys and ''Mystery Girl''===\n\nIt was also in 1988 that Orbison began collaborating seriously with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] bandleader [[Jeff Lynne]] on a new album. Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on Harrison's new single.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=211}} They subsequently contacted [[Bob Dylan]], who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to [[Tom Petty]]'s residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour.<ref>Amburn, p. 218.</ref> By that evening, the group had written \"[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]\", which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the [[Traveling Wilburys]], representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself \"Lefty Wilbury\" after Lefty Frizzell.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref> Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: \"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 221.</ref>\n\nLynne later spoke of the recording sessions: \"Everybody just sat there going, 'Wow, it's Roy Orbison!'&nbsp;... Even though he's become your pal and you're hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, as soon as he gets behind that [mic] and he's doing his business, suddenly it's shudder time.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 208.</ref> Orbison was given one solo track, \"[[Not Alone Any More]]\", on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press. ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and topped out at No. 16 in the UK. The album won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group]].<ref name=\"grammy\"/> ''Rolling Stone'' included it in the top 100 albums of the decade.<ref>Amburn, p. 222.</ref>\n\nOrbison was in high demand for concerts and interviews once again, and was seemingly ecstatic about it. He began writing songs and collaborating with many musicians from his past and newer fans, to develop a solo album, ''[[Mystery Girl]]''.\n\n''Mystery Girl'' was co-produced by [[Jeff Lynne]], whom Orbison considered the best producer he had ever collaborated with.<ref>Amburn, p. 213.</ref> [[Elvis Costello]], Orbison's son Wesley and others offered their songs to him. The biggest hit from the album was \"[[You Got It]]\", written with Lynne and Tom Petty. It posthumously rose to No. 9 in the US and No. 3 in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name=\"britishhits\"/>\n\nIn 2014, a demo of Orbison's \"The Way Is Love\" was released as part of the 25th-anniversary deluxe edition of ''Mystery Girl''. The song was originally recorded on a stereo cassette player around 1986. Orbison's sons contributed instrumentation on the track along with Roy's vocals; it was produced by [[John Carter Cash]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/21/unreleased-roy-orbison-track-the-way-is-love\n| title      = Unreleased Roy Orbison track resurrected by singer's sons\n| author     = Sean Michaels\n| date       = March 21, 2014\n| work       = The Guardian\n| accessdate = October 7, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the video for the Wilburys' \"Handle with Care\" was filmed with Orbison, the video for \"[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]\" was filmed and released posthumously.

In the final three months of his life, he gave ''Rolling Stone'' magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted [[Martin Sheen]] to play him in a biopic.<ref name=Pond/> In November 1988, ''Mystery Girl'' was completed, and ''Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1'' was rising up the charts. Around this time, Orbison confided in [[Johnny Cash]] that he was having chest pains. He went to Europe, was presented with an award there, and played a show in [[Antwerp]], where footage for the video for \"You Got It\" was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule. A few days later, a manager at a club in [[Boston]] was concerned that he looked ill, but Orbison played the show, to another standing ovation.<ref>Amburn, pp. 227\u2013228.</ref>\n\nOrbison performed at the Front Row Theater in [[Highland Heights, Ohio]], on December 4. Exhausted, he returned to his home in Hendersonville to rest for several days before flying again to London to film two more videos for the Traveling Wilburys. On December 6, 1988, he spent the day flying [[model aircraft|model airplanes]] with his sons and ate dinner at his mother's home in Hendersonville.

The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, \"He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 58.</ref> Orbison was known as \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]\"<ref name=\"amburn97\">Amburn, p. 97.</ref><ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-roy-orbison-croon-oh-pretty-woman-with-the-royal-philharmonic-125895/|title=Hear Roy Orbison Croon 'Oh, Pretty Woman' With the Royal Philharmonic|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|first2=Stephen L.|last2=Betts|date=October 5, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> and \"the Big O\".<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/>\n\nRoys Boys LLC, a Nashville-based company founded by Orbison's sons to administer their father's catalog and safeguard his legacy, announced a November 16, 2018, release of ''Unchained Melodies: Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra'' album as well as a fall 2018 Roy Orbison Hologram tour called ''In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/10/roy-orbison-with-royal-philharmonic-unchained-melodies-releases-1116-includes-duet-with-country-musi.html|title=Roy Orbison with Royal Philharmonic \"Unchained Melodies\" Releases 11/16, Includes Duet With Country Music Sensation Cam|website=Music News Net}}</ref>\n\n===Songwriting===\n====Structures====\n\nMusic critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that Orbison's compositions \"define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music\".<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 20\">Lehman, p. 20.</ref> Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.<ref>Lehman, p. 9.</ref> Peter Watrous, writing for the ''New York Times'', declared in a concert review, \"He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity\".<ref name=\"watrous\">Watrous, Peter (July 31, 1988). \"Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold\". ''The New York Times''. p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.<ref>Lehman, p. 46.</ref> The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[32-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Claudette\". Orbison's \"In Dreams\" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In \"Running Scared\", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. \"Crying\" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.<ref>Lehman, p. 53.</ref> Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before \"Only the Lonely\", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:<ref name=\"nswhof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way....So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song, and sometimes there is no chorus, it just goes...But that's always after the fact\u2014as I'm writing, it all sounds natural and in sequence to me.\" | Roy Orbison}}\n\n[[Elton John]]'s songwriting partner and main lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]] wrote that Orbison's songs always made \"radical left turns\", and [[k.d. lang]] declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of \"Running Scared\" eventually depends on the final note, one word.<ref>Lehman, p. 52.</ref> Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, \"Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.\"<ref name=\"amburn128\"/>\n\n====Themes====\n\nCritic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as \"Go! Go! Go!\" and \"Mean Woman Blues\" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]]. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.<ref>Lehman, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: \"Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy\u2014try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are \"dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces\".<ref name=\"watrous\"/> Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the \"apocalyptic romanticism\" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was \"so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia\", striking \"a postmodern nerve\".<ref>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: \"The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nThe loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: \"I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, \"He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: \"When [\"Crying\"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\n===Voice quality===\n{{Quote box\n | width = 30%\n | quote = What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time.

When Orbison started with \"Crying\" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: \"The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up.

Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nOrbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, \"I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Roy Orbison discography}}\n\n==Honors==\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time'.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231 |title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 27, 2008 |via=Rolling Stone website |access-date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}\n\n* '''Grammys'''<ref name=\"grammy\"/>\n** Best Country Performance Duo or Group (1980), with Emmylou Harris\n** Best Spoken Word or Non-Musical Recording (1986), with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Sam Phillips, Rick Nelson and Chips Moman\n** Best Country Vocal Collaboration (1988), with k.d. lang\n** Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (1989), as part of the Traveling Wilburys\n** Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male (1990)\n** Lifetime Achievement Award (1998)\n* [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1987)<ref name=\"rockhall\"/>\n* [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1987)<ref name=\"nswhof\"/>\n* [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1989)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C173 |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Songwriters Hall of Fame |access-date=May 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130041222/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C173 |archive-date=January 30, 2009}}</ref>\n* Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (2010)<ref name=\"Beeb\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8488965.stm Roy Orbison given Hollywood Walk of Fame star] BBC News (January 30, 2010).

Many critics described his music as operatic, nicknaming him \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] of Rock\" and \"the Big O\". Most male rock-and-roll performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, while many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability. He performed standing still, wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses.\n\nOrbison began singing in a [[rockabilly]] and [[Country music|country-and-western]] band in high school. He was contracted by [[Sam Phillips]] of [[Sun Records]] in 1956, but his greatest success came with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of his singles reached the ''Billboard'' Top 40, and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10, including \"[[Only the Lonely]]\" (1960), \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\" (1961), \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" (1961), \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (1963), and \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" (1964). Soon afterward, he was struck by a number of personal tragedies while his record sales declined.\n\nIn the 1980s, Orbison experienced a resurgence in popularity following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he co-founded the [[Traveling Wilburys]], a rock supergroup with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison died of a heart attack in December 1988 at age 52. One month later, his song \"[[You Got It]]\" (1989) was released as a solo single and became his first hit to reach the U.S. Top 10 in nearly 25 years.\n\nOrbison's honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in the same year, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2014. ''Rolling Stone'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed him at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\nOrbison was born on April 23, 1936 in [[Vernon, Texas]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carr|first=Joe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&pg=RA10-PP22|title=Prairie Nights to Neon Lights: The Story of Country Music in West Texas|last2=Munde|first2=Alan|date=October 1996|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|isbn=978-0-89672-365-8|pages=134|language=en}}</ref> the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison (1913\u20131984), an oil well driller and car mechanic, and nurse Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 \u2013 May 12, 1992).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Nadine-Orbison/6000000012909498491 |title=Nadine Vesta Orbison |website=geni}}</ref> The family moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] in 1942 to find work in the aircraft factories.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|last=Orbison|first=Alex|publisher=Center Street|others=Orbison, Wesley,, Orbison, Roy Jr., Slate, Jeff,, Riesco, Marcel|year=2017|isbn=9781478976547|edition= Second|location=New York|pages=28|oclc=1017566749}}</ref>\n\nRoy attended Denver Avenue Elementary School<ref name=\":0\" /> until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon, and they moved again to [[Wink, Texas]] in 1946.

He recalled, \"I was finished, you know, for anything else\" by the time he was 7, and music became the focus of his life.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 7.</ref> His major musical influence as a youth was country music. He was particularly moved by [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s singing, with its slurred syllables,<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 21.</ref> and he adopted the name \"Lefty Wilbury\" during his time with the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. He also enjoyed [[Hank Williams]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].

In West Texas, he was exposed to [[rhythm and blues]]), [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], the orchestral arrangements of [[Mantovani]], and Cajun music. The cajun favorite \"[[Jole Blon]]\" was one of the first songs that he sang in public. He began singing on a local radio show at age 8, and he became the show's host b y the late 1940s.<ref>Amburn, pp. 8, 9.</ref>\n\nIn high school, Orbison and some friends formed the band Wink Westerners.

He heard a song called \"Ooby Dooby\" while in college, composed by [[Dick Penner]] and Wade Moore, and he returned to Wink with \"Ooby Dooby\" in hand and continued performing with the Wink Westerners after his first year.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} He then enrolled in [[Odessa College|Odessa Junior College]].

The song was released on Sun 242 in May 1956{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and broke into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> The Teen Kings toured with [[Sonny James]], [[Johnny Horton]], Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing \"everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record\".<ref>Clayson, Alan p. 44.</ref> The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including \"[[Go Go Go (Down the Line)|Go! Go! Go!]]\" and \"Rockhouse\". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there.{{efn|Alan Clayson's biography refers to her as Claudette Hestand.}} They stayed in Phillips' home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice.<ref>Amburn, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> A ballad Orbison wrote, \"The Clown\", met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer [[Jack Clement]] told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 45.</ref>\n\nOrbison was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, once going to pick up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison wrote \"Claudette\"\u2014about Claudette Frady, whom he married in 1957\u2014and the [[Everly Brothers]] recorded it as the B-side of \"[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]\". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 56.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period in the late 1950s, Orbison made his living at [[Acuff-Rose Music|Acuff-Rose]], a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to [[Wesley Rose]], who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison attempted to sell to [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] his recordings of songs by other writers, working with and being in awe of [[Chet Atkins]], who had played guitar with Presley. One song he tried was \"Seems to Me\", by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant|Boudleaux Bryant]]. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of \"a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then\u2014softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 62.</ref>\n\nPlaying shows at night and living with his wife and young child in a tiny apartment, Orbison often took his guitar to his car to write songs. The songwriter [[Joe Melson]], an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to write some songs together.<ref>Clayson, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs at [[RCA Studio B|RCA Nashville]].

His initial success came just as the '50s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.<ref>Lehman, p. 19.</ref>\n\n===Top-10 hits===\n====1960\u201362====\n\nExperimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from \"Uptown\", and another song they had written called \"Come Back to Me (My Love)\", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\">Zak, p. 35.</ref> It also featured a note hit by Orbison in [[falsetto]] that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, \"came not from his throat but deeper within\".<ref>Clayson, p. 77.</ref> The song was \"[[Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)]]\". Orbison and Melson tried to pitch it to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, but were turned down.<ref>Amburn p. 91.</ref> They instead recorded the song at RCA's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\"/><ref name=Fremer>{{cite interview |interviewer=Michael Fremer |last=Porter |first=Bill |date=January 1, 2006 |url=http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |title=Recording Elvis and Roy With Legendary Studio Wiz Bill Porter \u2013 Part II |website=MusicAngle |access-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714134327/http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |archive-date=July 14, 2011}}</ref> This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\"/>\n\n\"Only the Lonely\" shot to number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1988, \"I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Only the Lonely\", it kind of turned into a good voice.\"<ref name=\"rockhall\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/roy-orbison |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> Its success transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' out of New York City.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=78}} When Presley heard \"Only the Lonely\" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.<ref name=\"amburn98\">Amburn, p. 98.</ref> Melson and Orbison followed it with the more complex \"Blue Angel\", which peaked at number nine in the US and number 11 in the UK. \"I'm Hurtin'\", with \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" as the B-side, rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Running Scared.ogg\n|title=\"Running Scared\" (1961)\n|description=The ending of \"Running Scared\" features Orbison's natural voice hitting high A natural.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison was now able to move to Nashville permanently with his wife Claudette and two sons Roy DeWayne and Anthony King.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of \"Only the Lonely\" and \"I'm Hurtin'\", Orbison worked on a new song, \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\", based loosely on the rhythm of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]''; the song was about a man on the lookout for his girlfriend's previous boyfriend, whom he feared would try to take her away. Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.<ref name=decurtis155/> On that third take, \"Running Scared\" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, \"He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> Just weeks later \"Running Scared\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected \"Running Scared\": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n\"Crying\" followed in July 1961 and reached number two; it was coupled with an up-tempo R&B song, \"Candy Man\", written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 30, staying on the charts for two months.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as \"The Big O\", partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with \"[[Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)]]\", an upbeat song by country songwriter [[Cindy Walker]]. (Orbison's producer later formed [[the Candymen]] quintet, which was Orbison's backing band from 1965 to 1970 and released a few singles and two albums of its own). Also in 1962, he charted with \"The Crowd\", \"Leah\", and \"Workin' for the Man\", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref>Amburn, p. 32.</ref> His relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 91.</ref>\n\n====1963\u201364====\n[[File:1965 Roy Orbison.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Orbison began performing while wearing sunglasses in 1963, later recalling that he \"wasn't trying to be weird ...

He had no publicist in the early 1960s, therefore he had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' called him an \"anonymous celebrity\".<ref>Lehman, p. 18.</ref> After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an aeroplane in 1963, while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had a good sense of humor and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe [[stage fright]]; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat.

His string of top-40 hits continued with \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (US number seven, UK number six), \"Falling\" (US number 22, UK number 9), and \"[[Mean Woman Blues]]\" (US number five, UK number three) coupled with \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" (US number 29, UK number three).{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name=\"britishhits\">Brown, Kutner, and Warwick, p. 645.</ref> According to the official Roy Orbison U.S. discography by Marcel Riesco,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=249}} a rare alternate version of \"Blue Bayou\" was released in Italy. Orbison finished 1963 with a Christmas song written by [[Willie Nelson]], \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" (US number 15 in 1963, UK number six in 1964).\n\nAs \"In Dreams\" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace [[Duane Eddy]] on a tour of the UK in top billing with the [[the Beatles|Beatles]]. When he arrived in Britain, however, he realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of the Beatles, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, \"What's a Beatle, anyway?\" to which [[John Lennon]] replied, after tapping his shoulder, \"I am\".<ref>Amburn, p. 115.</ref> On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. The Beatles stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison sang through 14 encores.<ref name=\"clayson109-113\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 109\u2013113.</ref> Finally, when the audience began chanting \"We want Roy!\" again, Lennon and McCartney physically held Orbison back.<ref>Amburn, p. 117.</ref> Starr later said, \"In [[Glasgow]], we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting.

''The Beatles Anthology. Chronicle''. p. 94</ref> Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.\n\nTouring in 1963 took a toll on Orbison's personal life. His wife Claudette had an affair with the contractor who built their home in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. Friends and relatives attributed the breakdown of the marriage to her youth and her inability to withstand being alone and bored. When Orbison toured Britain again in the fall of 1963, she joined him.<ref>Amburn, pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> He was immensely popular wherever he went, finishing the tour in Ireland and Canada. Almost immediately, he toured Australia and New Zealand with [[the Beach Boys]] and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him.<ref>Amburn, p. 125.</ref> He travelled to Australia again, this time with [[the Rolling Stones]]. [[Mick Jagger]] later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, \"a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was.\"<ref name=\"amburn134\">Amburn, p. 134.</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Oh, Pretty Woman.ogg\n|title=\"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (1964)\n|description=The opening guitar riff of \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was a direct influence on \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" by the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]].<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 128 and Lehman, p. 169.</ref>\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison also began collaborating with [[Bill Dees]], whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote \"[[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|It's Over]]\", a number-one hit in the UK and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, \"A pretty woman never needs any money\".<ref>Amburn, p. 127.</ref> Just 40 minutes later, \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a [[Bob Hope]] movie, the epithet ''mercy'' Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as ''Billboard'' magazine noted, \"In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the ''only'' American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964.

Orbison was a film enthusiast and, when not touring, writing or recording, dedicated time to seeing up to three films a day.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nRose also became Orbison's producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison's best work could only be achieved with RCA Nashville's A-Team.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\"/> Orbison's first collection at MGM, an album titled ''There Is Only One Roy Orbison'', sold fewer than 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> With the onset of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964\u201365, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison's generation were driven from the charts.<ref>Lehman, p. 14</ref>\n\nWhile on tour again in the UK in 1966,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=131}} Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette traveled to England to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=129}}\n\nOrbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot.<ref>Amburn, p. 126.</ref>\n\nOrbison and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles; she had grown up around them, but he claimed Elvis Presley had introduced him to motorcycles.<ref>Amburn, p. 54.</ref> Tragedy struck on June 6, 1966, however, when Orbison and Claudette were riding home from [[Bristol, Tennessee]]. She struck the door of a pickup truck which had pulled out in front of her on South Water Avenue in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]], and died instantly.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 139.</ref>\n\nA grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with [[Bill Dees]] to write music for ''[[The Fastest Guitar Alive]]'', a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy.<ref>Lehman, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> Orbison's character was a spy who stole, and had to protect and deliver, a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]], and was outfitted with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line, \"I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time\", with\u2014according to biographer Colin Escott\u2014\"zero conviction\".<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box office flop.

During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[the Doors]], Orbison felt lost and directionless, later saying: \"[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 152.</ref>\n\nDuring a tour of England and playing [[Birmingham]] on Saturday, September 14, 1968,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=144}} he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 161\u201363.</ref> The property was sold to [[Johnny Cash]], who demolished the building and planted an orchard on it.

Aside from a few minor hits in Australia, he also failed to produce any charting singles after the 1960s. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents and several of his 1970s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records.<ref>Amburn, p. 170.</ref> Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: \"Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 2.</ref> His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released covers of his songs, which proved popular. Orbison's version of \"[[Love Hurts]]\", a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers, was remade by [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], again by [[Hard Rock music|hard rock]] band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and by [[blues]] adept [[Jim Capaldi]]. [[Sonny James]] sent \"Only the Lonely\" to No. 1 on the country music charts.<ref>Amburn, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> [[Bruce Springsteen]] ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and [[Glen Campbell]] had a minor hit with a remake of \"Dream Baby\".\n\nA compilation of Orbison's greatest hits went to No. 1 in the UK in January 1976. The same year, he began to open concerts for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], who started as [[Linda Ronstadt|Linda Ronstadt's]] backup band. Ronstadt herself covered \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" in 1977, her version reaching No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career.<ref>Amburn, p. 178.</ref> He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded \"[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]\" with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.\n\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|Orbison with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis for a televised 1977 Christmas special]]\n\nIn late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to overwinter in [[Hawaii]]. While there, he checked into a hospital where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed [[coronary arteries]]. On January 18, 1978, Orbison underwent a triple [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary bypass]]. He had suffered from [[Peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcers]] since as early as 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 3, 183\u2013184.</ref> He felt revitalized following the triple bypass, but he continued to smoke, and his weight fluctuated for the remainder of his life.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1980, [[Don McLean]] charted with \"Crying\"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and his version unexpectedly went to the top of the charts at first in the Netherlands, afterward hitting No. 5 in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was No. 1 in the UK for three weeks, and also topped the Irish Charts.<ref>Amburn, p. 182.</ref> Although he was all but forgotten in the US, Orbison reached the most unlikely places for a rock and roll legend, like [[Bulgaria]] for example in 1982.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964; he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of [[Sofia]].<ref>Amburn, p. 183.</ref> In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris had won a [[Grammy Award]] for their duet \"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\" (from the comedy film ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'', in which Orbison also had a cameo role) and things were picking up.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}} It was his first such award, and he felt hopeful in making a full return to popular music.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 192.</ref> However, it would be several more years until this came to fruition. In the meantime, [[Van Halen]] released a hard-rock cover of \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" on their 1982 album ''[[Diver Down]]'', again further exposing a younger generation to Orbison's legacy.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}}\n\n=== Career revival ===\n\n[[File:Orbison1987.jpg|thumb|left|Orbison performing in New York in 1987]]\n\nOrbison originally declined [[David Lynch]]'s request to allow the use of \"In Dreams\" for the film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986).<ref>Amburn, p. 191.</ref> Lynch used it anyway (although his first choice was \"Crying\"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=199}}); the song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] (played by  [[Dennis Hopper]]). It was lip-synched by an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] drug dealer played by [[Dean Stockwell]], after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere.<ref name=\"Amburn, p. 193\">Amburn, p. 193.</ref> Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, \"I was mortified because they were talking about the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal&nbsp;... I thought, 'What in the world&nbsp;...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie\u2014how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/>\n\nBy 1987, Orbison's career was fully revived.

They were joined by [[Jackson Browne]], [[T Bone Burnett]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[James Burton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.james-burton.net/biography/ |title=Biography |website=The Official James Burton Website |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref> and [[k.d. lang]]. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: \"Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 207.</ref> The concert was filmed in one take and aired on [[Cinemax]] under the title ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night]]''; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.<ref>Amburn, p. 205.</ref>\n\n===Traveling Wilburys and ''Mystery Girl''===\n\nIt was also in 1988 that Orbison began collaborating seriously with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] bandleader [[Jeff Lynne]] on a new album. Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on Harrison's new single.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=211}} They subsequently contacted [[Bob Dylan]], who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to [[Tom Petty]]'s residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour.<ref>Amburn, p. 218.</ref> By that evening, the group had written \"[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]\", which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the [[Traveling Wilburys]], representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself \"Lefty Wilbury\" after Lefty Frizzell.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref> Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: \"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 221.</ref>\n\nLynne later spoke of the recording sessions: \"Everybody just sat there going, 'Wow, it's Roy Orbison!'&nbsp;... Even though he's become your pal and you're hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, as soon as he gets behind that [mic] and he's doing his business, suddenly it's shudder time.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 208.</ref> Orbison was given one solo track, \"[[Not Alone Any More]]\", on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press. ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and topped out at No. 16 in the UK. The album won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group]].<ref name=\"grammy\"/> ''Rolling Stone'' included it in the top 100 albums of the decade.<ref>Amburn, p. 222.</ref>\n\nOrbison was in high demand for concerts and interviews once again, and was seemingly ecstatic about it. He began writing songs and collaborating with many musicians from his past and newer fans, to develop a solo album, ''[[Mystery Girl]]''.\n\n''Mystery Girl'' was co-produced by [[Jeff Lynne]], whom Orbison considered the best producer he had ever collaborated with.<ref>Amburn, p. 213.</ref> [[Elvis Costello]], Orbison's son Wesley and others offered their songs to him. The biggest hit from the album was \"[[You Got It]]\", written with Lynne and Tom Petty. It posthumously rose to No. 9 in the US and No. 3 in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name=\"britishhits\"/>\n\nIn 2014, a demo of Orbison's \"The Way Is Love\" was released as part of the 25th-anniversary deluxe edition of ''Mystery Girl''. The song was originally recorded on a stereo cassette player around 1986. Orbison's sons contributed instrumentation on the track along with Roy's vocals; it was produced by [[John Carter Cash]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/21/unreleased-roy-orbison-track-the-way-is-love\n| title      = Unreleased Roy Orbison track resurrected by singer's sons\n| author     = Sean Michaels\n| date       = March 21, 2014\n| work       = The Guardian\n| accessdate = October 7, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the video for the Wilburys' \"Handle with Care\" was filmed with Orbison, the video for \"[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]\" was filmed and released posthumously.

In the final three months of his life, he gave ''Rolling Stone'' magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted [[Martin Sheen]] to play him in a biopic.<ref name=Pond/> In November 1988, ''Mystery Girl'' was completed, and ''Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1'' was rising up the charts. Around this time, Orbison confided in [[Johnny Cash]] that he was having chest pains. He went to Europe, was presented with an award there, and played a show in [[Antwerp]], where footage for the video for \"You Got It\" was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule. A few days later, a manager at a club in [[Boston]] was concerned that he looked ill, but Orbison played the show, to another standing ovation.<ref>Amburn, pp. 227\u2013228.</ref>\n\nOrbison performed at the Front Row Theater in [[Highland Heights, Ohio]], on December 4. Exhausted, he returned to his home in Hendersonville to rest for several days before flying again to London to film two more videos for the Traveling Wilburys. On December 6, 1988, he spent the day flying [[model aircraft|model airplanes]] with his sons and ate dinner at his mother's home in Hendersonville.

The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, \"He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 58.</ref> Orbison was known as \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]\"<ref name=\"amburn97\">Amburn, p. 97.</ref><ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-roy-orbison-croon-oh-pretty-woman-with-the-royal-philharmonic-125895/|title=Hear Roy Orbison Croon 'Oh, Pretty Woman' With the Royal Philharmonic|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|first2=Stephen L.|last2=Betts|date=October 5, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> and \"the Big O\".<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/>\n\nRoys Boys LLC, a Nashville-based company founded by Orbison's sons to administer their father's catalog and safeguard his legacy, announced a November 16, 2018 release of ''Unchained Melodies: Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra'' album as well as a fall 2018 Roy Orbison Hologram tour called ''In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/10/roy-orbison-with-royal-philharmonic-unchained-melodies-releases-1116-includes-duet-with-country-musi.html|title=Roy Orbison with Royal Philharmonic \"Unchained Melodies\" Releases 11/16, Includes Duet With Country Music Sensation Cam|website=Music News Net}}</ref>\n\n===Songwriting===\n====Structures====\n\nMusic critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that Orbison's compositions \"define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music\".<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 20\">Lehman, p. 20.</ref> Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.<ref>Lehman, p. 9.</ref> Peter Watrous, writing for the ''New York Times'', declared in a concert review, \"He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity\".<ref name=\"watrous\">Watrous, Peter (July 31, 1988). \"Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold\". ''The New York Times''. p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.<ref>Lehman, p. 46.</ref> The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[32-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Claudette\". Orbison's \"In Dreams\" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In \"Running Scared\", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. \"Crying\" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.<ref>Lehman, p. 53.</ref> Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before \"Only the Lonely\", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:<ref name=\"nswhof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way....So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song, and sometimes there is no chorus, it just goes...But that's always after the fact\u2014as I'm writing, it all sounds natural and in sequence to me.\" | Roy Orbison}}\n\n[[Elton John]]'s songwriting partner and main lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]] wrote that Orbison's songs always made \"radical left turns\", and [[k.d. lang]] declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of \"Running Scared\" eventually depends on the final note, one word.<ref>Lehman, p. 52.</ref> Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, \"Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.\"<ref name=\"amburn128\"/>\n\n====Themes====\n\nCritic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as \"Go! Go! Go!\" and \"Mean Woman Blues\" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]]. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.<ref>Lehman, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: \"Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy\u2014try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are \"dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces\".<ref name=\"watrous\"/> Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the \"apocalyptic romanticism\" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was \"so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia\", striking \"a postmodern nerve\".<ref>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: \"The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nThe loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: \"I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, \"He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: \"When [\"Crying\"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\n===Voice quality===\n{{Quote box\n | width = 30%\n | quote = What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time.

[[Dwight Yoakam]] stated that Orbison's voice sounded like \"the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window\".<ref>Lehman, p. 22.</ref> [[Barry Gibb]] of [[The Bee Gees]] went further to say that when he heard \"Crying\" for the first time, \"That was it.

When Orbison started with \"Crying\" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: \"The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up.

During the first few songs in a concert, the [[vibrato]] in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 24\">Lehman, p. 24.</ref> This also happened with age.

Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nOrbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily.

The project redesigned and developed a 7,000 square meter property between [[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]] in the west and Domplatz in the east, delimited by Braubachstrasse in the north and the Schirn Kunsthalle in the south.  an effort to remake the old city centre, the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] (old town) of [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]], which was severely damaged during [[World War II]], in the style of the pre-war architecture.\n\nIt aims to give the old town quarter between the [[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]] square and the [[Frankfurt Cathedral|Cathedral]] (Dom) new life. The old city had already been thoroughly changed in 1904 by hewing several aisles for wide streets into the medieval cluster of insalubrious houses and small alley ways, clearing the way for a tramway line through the historic centre.\n\nDue to the heavy [[bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II]] with many [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] buildings, most of the city's old town was destroyed. The efforts to rebuild parts of it began in the 1950s with the [[R\u00f6mer]] city hall, which was built as a modern office building behind the old fa\u00e7ade still standing after the war, and parts of the surrounding [[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]] square, building an underground [[multi-storey car park]], and on top of that the modern ''Technisches Rathaus''<ref>[[c:Category:Technisches_Rathaus|Photos of the former Technisches Rathaus Frankfurt]]</ref> (''Technical City Hall'', built 1972\u201374), whose fa\u00e7ade paid homage to the historic context of the city with the [[timber frame|timber frame design (''Fachwerk'')]] of the pre-war architecture, but within the context of \"[[Brutalist architecture]]\". The ''Historisches Museum'' (Museum of city history) was also built, including a cinema.  In its entrance way, the museum displayed a model of the old centre as it looked at the end of World War II; in ruins.\n\nThe anti-[[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] movement continued in a public campaign to demolish the {{lang|de|Technische Rathaus}} and to make the old city look like before the war. This did finally succeed, the {{lang|de|Technisches Rathaus}} and the Museum of City History were demolished in 2010/2011, and the reconstruction of the old town core began.\n\nThe project is being built on top of a 1970s underground multi-storey car park and the [[U-Bahn Line B (Frankfurt U-Bahn)|U-Bahn Line B]] station underneath. Because of the demolition of the ''Technisches Rathaus'', the underground moved and the tunnel had to be monitored closely and corrected several times.\n\nCivic engagement in particular led to the old-town-oriented planning of the Dom-R\u00f6mer project.<ref>{{citation|periodical=[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]|title=Neue Altstadt Frankfurt|date=2018-05-09|language=German|url=http://www.fr.de/Neue+Altstadt+Frankfurt./ |access-date=2018-05-11\n}}</ref> The 35 designs of new buildings were 2010/11 in several architectural competitions determined with more than 170 participants.

The areas marked in dark red were torn down in 1927.]]\n[[File:Frankfurt 1945 June destructions after bombing raids old town aerial.JPG|thumb|The destroyed old town in June 1945]]\nDuring the Second World War, the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] old town of Frankfurt am Main , until then one of the best preserved in Central Europe, was almost completely destroyed by bombing. Only a few historical buildings remained, and in the [[History of Germany (1945\u20131990)|post-war]] period, other damaged buildings were also demolished, mostly in favour of \"car-friendly\" traffic planning. There were very few external reconstructions of buildings and the majority of the former old town was rebuilt in the style of the 1950s, largely leaving the historic street network behind.\n\nOnly the area between R\u00f6merberg and the cathedral remained after the rubble clearance wasteland, over whose development has long been debated. In the meantime, from 1953, archaeologists were able to uncover the remains of a Roman settlement, but also recent traces, especially from the Carolingian period, beneath the area of the high medieval layers . A centuries-long search for the origin of the city was therefore over, although the Royal Palatinate Frankfurt, which had previously only been handed down through documents, was not built by the legendary founder of Frankfurt, Charlemagne, but, according to findings, only by his son, Ludwig the Pious .\n\nIn 1966 construction began on the B section of the Frankfurt subway between the main train station and the Konstablerwache. The line of the new underground also led through the old town, with a station under the previously undeveloped area used as a parking lot between the cathedral and the Roman. When the Dom/R\u00f6mer underground station was built in 1970/71, due to the open construction method, it was accepted to destroy a large part of the oldest settlement floor in Frankfurt, which had not yet been archaeologically examined.\n\nSubsequently, after years of discussion on the site, the Technical City Hall was created in 1972\u20131974 as the seat of the technical offices of the city administration. Five old town houses on Braubachstrasse that had survived the war were demolished to excavate the construction pit. The building, built in the brutalist architectural style, represented with its enormous dimensions, dominated the former old town, not taking into account of the small-scale buildings in the area. The construction costs totalled DM 93 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wortprotokoll \u00fcber die 19. Plenarsitzung der Stadtverordnetenversammlung am Donnerstag, dem 15.

After the construction work was completed, the ceiling of the underground car park formed the new level, which was now about two meters above the historical floor level. The archaeological finds of the old town excavation from 1953, dating from the early days of Frankfurt, also initially removed, were preserved and made accessible to the public as an archaeological garden .\n\nIn 1994 the city of Frankfurt sold the Technical City Hall for DM 148 million to Deutsche Immobilien Leasing (DIL), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. At the same time, the building was leased back to the city with the option that the city could buy back the town hall for DM 135 million after the lease expired in 2006, a so-called sale-lease-back agreement.<ref name=\"faz.net-20041108\">{{cite news|title=Stadtplanung \u2013 Umbau statt Abri\u00df \u2013 neue Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr Technisches Rathaus in Frankfurt|newspaper=faz.net|publisher=|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/frankfurt/stadtplanung-umbau-statt-abriss-neue-plaene-fuer-technisches-rathaus-in-frankfurt-1194573.html|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=2004-11-08|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Planning History ==\n\n=== 2004\u20132006 ===\n[[File:Technischesrathaus-ffm001.jpg|thumb|Technical City Hall, 2007]]\nIn 2004, the project developers ''Max Baum Immobilien'' and ''Gro\u00df & Partner,'' on behalf of the owner DIL, presented plans for a renovation of the 30-year-old technical town hall . According to plans by the Frankfurt office of ''Stefan Forster Architects'', the building complex was to be divided into two houses by an alley from Braubachstrasse to the roundel of the Schirn Kunsthallebe to be created. For the concrete facades, a completely new design with a perforated facade made of natural stone was planned, for future use in the four-story base the city library as well as shops and restaurants. In addition, around 160 apartments were to be created in the three towers. The leasing contract with the city could have been extended to 20 years, subject to the modified use of the building.<ref name=\"faz.net-20041108\" />\n[[File:Technisches-Rathaus-Frankfurt 2007 LWS0780.jpg|thumb|The facades of the technical town hall, July 2008]]\n[[File:Frankfurt Altstadt-Goldene Waage.jpg|thumb|House of the Golden Libra , around 1900]]\nThe city council then decided in December 2004 to carry out an urban planning ideas competition in which both variants (renovation or demolition with subsequent small-scale development) were to be run through.

The following requirements were then set for the urban planning competition: small-scale buildings with facades and roofs that fit harmoniously into the old town, housing 20,000 m\u00b2 of gross floor space within the property boundaries of the Technical City Hall, overbuilding of the archaeological garden with 7,000 m\u00b2, continued use of the archaeological site Garden with the remains of the Royal Palatinate and the restoration of the old \"coronation path\" between the cathedral and the Roman. The name \"Coronation Trail\", an alternative name for the alley ''market''(also known as the ''Old Market'' ), which existed until 1945, arose from the fact that a total of 16 coronation ceremonies for Roman-German kings were held in Frankfurt from the 14th to the 18th century. 20 offices took part in the urban planning competition.<ref name=\"faz.net\">[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/architektur-abriss-des-technischen-rathauses-gesichert-1256606.html ''Abri\u00df des Technischen Rathauses gesichert.''] In: ''faz.net'', 25.

These provided that the city would not buy back the property, but that the leasing model would continue.<ref name=\"faz.net\" />\n\nIn August 2005, the Free Voters in the R\u00f6mer submitted an application for the planned Dom-R\u00f6mer area to approach the historic streets and squares and to reconstruct some important buildings in terms of urban planning, such as the ''Haus zur Goldenen Waage'' or the ''Haus zum Esslinger'' ( also known as ''Young Esslinger'' or ''Aunt Melber's house'' ). However, the winning design chosen by the Frankfurt office KSP Engel and Zimmermann in September 2005 met only a few of these requirements. The \"Coronation Trail\" was not laid out along the course of the market, which was even largely respected by the construction of the Technical Town Hall in 1972, but in a straight diagonal fromStone house to the cathedral tower. The overplanned areas of the technical town hall and the archaeological garden were once again occupied by large buildings; a residential complex with three courtyards was to be built on Braubachstrasse. In addition to a narrow building, a trapezoidal square was planned at the level of the archaeological garden, which, like the diagonal to the cathedral tower, had never existed in a similar form in Frankfurt's urban history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neue Altstadt \u2013 KSP gewinnen Wettbewerb f\u00fcr Zentrum von Frankfurt (19.

The New Red House, first mentioned in 1322, probably dates back to the 14th century, the neighbor from the 16th century. The two houses were previously connected to each other inside, the New Red House had no separate entrance. With its ground floor structure consisting essentially of only three oak columns, which bore the entire weight of the three-story building above it, the New Red House was unique in the entire German half-timbered landscape and a well-known attraction far beyond the city. It was considered an outstanding example of medieval town planning and community spirit in the lively center of the old town. The Red House formed the passage to ''Tuchgaden'' and stood at the entrance to the butcher's quarter on the ''Lange Schirn'', at which the Frankfurter sausages have been sold since ancient times . The new building is also used by a butcher, which also has a sales stand in the Kleinmarkthalle .\n\nSouth of the new row of houses on the market, the ''town house'' consisting of five building parts was built ''on the market'' from 2013 to 2016 . The design comes from ''Meurer Architects'' , Frankfurt, with ''cba architectes'' , Luxembourg. The town house serves on the one hand to permanently preserve and make accessible the archaeological excavations of the Roman settlement on the cathedral hill and the imperial palace Franconofurd ; on the other hand as a meeting and event building. The end of the building complex to the west to the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt is ''House 5'' , a residential building. It is based on the course of the historic alley of ''Tuchgaden'' .\n\nThere is a height difference of more than two meters between the street level of the reconstructed Old Market and today's Bendergasse along the Schirn. It is made clear in the section between the New Red House and the western entrance to the Dom / R\u00f6mer underground station by a wall and pergola made of sandstone. Due to the protruding rotunda of the Schirn, there was not enough space in this section for a southern row of houses opposite the Markt 26 to Markt 40 houses. Before the destruction narrow alleys chain in this section three ''Goldhutgasse'' , ''Drachengasse'' and ''sword-alley'' to the south, the south of it at the Five Finger Square met again.\n\n=== Rebstock-Hof ===\n[[File:Dom-Roemer-Projekt-Hof zum-Rebstock-0918.jpg|thumb|''Hof zum Rebstock'' , left part of the back of ''Markt 2'']]\nThe east side of the Rebstock-Hof is the Haus am Dom , which was built from 2001 to 2004 through the renovation and expansion of the ''main customs office'' built by Werner Hebebrand in 1927 . Even though it was built as part of the New Frankfurt project , the main customs office already received a steep, curved gable roof as a tribute to the surrounding old town development, which was retained during the renovation. The house at the cathedral was extended at the southern end during the renovation, so that it protrudes a few meters from the historic building of the ''old market'' and comes closer to the reconstructed ''golden scales'' . The neighboring house ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock''(Market 8), however, keeps the original parcel. The northern entrance to the Rebstock-Hof lies between the two buildings. The north side of it is the new building ''Rebstock-Hof 2'' (Markt 2, formerly Im Rebstock 2),<ref>{{cite web|title=Markt 2 (Rebstock-Hof 2)|periodical=Dom-R\u00f6mer GMBH|publisher=|url=https://www.domroemer.de/markt-2|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-11-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref> a residential and commercial building by ''Meurer'' , Frankfurt. With a sand-colored plastered facade and slate roof, it looks like an extension to the house on the cathedral.

The gable roof is divided by a dwarf house with a Rhenish wave gable and two rows of dormer windows.

The three-storey Renaissance building from the 16th century was designed by ''Dreysse Architects'' , Frankfurt am Main and ''Jourdan & M\u00fcller'', Frankfurt am Main, reconstructed. The vaulted hall, whose six cross vaults rest on two central pillars, is a reminder of its former importance as a trade fair building . The new building is used by the Evangelical Regional Association Frankfurt am Main as the parish hall of the Paulsgemeinde and the Indonesian community.\n\nThe only reconstruction on the south side of the alley is the house ''Goldene Schere'' (Markt 22, side entrance, formerly Hinter dem L\u00e4mmchen 1) by the architects ''Hans Kollhoff'' , Berlin and ''Jourdan & M\u00fcller'' , Frankfurt am Main.<ref name=\"domroemer.de\"/> The four-story building in classicist forms was created in the 18th century by conversion from two older predecessor buildings.

The lines of argumentation often followed the same pattern as since the beginning of the reconstruction debate immediately after the destruction. Dieter Bartetzko compares the old town with an unfathomably deep fountain that draws on the myths of the past and gives life in the present. He recalls that the fountain on the chicken market was drilled as early as Roman times and that the Carolingian people were probably already aware that they lived on historical ground. This explains why Frankfurt was referred to in its first documentary mention in 794 as a ''locus celeber'' , a ''celebrated site'' . He describes the old town withNietzsche as an architectural palimpsest that always keeps the memory of the past in the minds of city dwellers, no matter how often it is overwritten. He explains this thesis using the example of the new building at ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8) and the reconstruction at ''Braubachstra\u00dfe 21'' . In contrast, the Technical City Hall, \"rammed as a concrete juggernaut in the middle of the previously closed row of houses on Braubachstrasse\", had remained a provocative and ignorant foreign body in the urban fabric for decades. In spite of its architectural quality, this was his doom.<ref>Dieter Bartetzko: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/umbaumassnahmen-in-der-frankfurter-altstadt-13531714.html ''Mut zum Traum''], in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 11.

It is a piece of civic pride that manifests itself in these houses, and the best craftsmen, artists, monument experts and architects contribute to it ... The citizen of the almost digitally located society insures the lost anchor of its origin and provides it with rock solid reinforcement made of cement.\"<ref>Dankwart Guratzsch: [https://www.welt.de/print/welt_kompakt/kultur/article139250653/Aber-bitte-richtig-alt.html ''Warum uns st\u00e4dtische Rekonstruktion gut tut \u2013 Frankfurt baut sein pr\u00e4chtiges historisches Zentrum neu auf.''] In: ''[[Die Welt]]'', 8.

This is no coincidence, \"the reconstruction architecture in Germany is currently developing into a key medium of authoritarian, ethnic, historical revisionist rights\". It was \"scandalous that the initiative of a right-wing radical without any significant civil society resistance led to a slick neighborhood with seemingly seamless repeat architectures\". The new old town is \"a sub-complex heal-world building that reduces history to a one-dimensional concert of your dreams ... A history in which National Socialism, the German wars of aggression and the Holocaust still survive as anecdotes of an otherwise unbroken national history\".<ref>Stephan Tr\u00fcby: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/neue-frankfurter-altstadt-durch-rechtsradikalen-initiiert-15531133.html Wir haben das Haus am rechten Fleck] In: [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung]], 8.

The debate about the old town has historical roots, since 1880 the design has always been struggling anew, with opponents and advocates of reconstructions not fitting in a right-left scheme. The reconstruction of the R\u00f6merberg-Ostzeile was based on an idea by the SPD Mayor Rudi Arndt .

They obtain their legitimation primarily from two sources: their craft quality and their civic acceptance.

The debate alone leads to more people thinking about the destruction and its background. On the other hand, \u201cno one in Frankfurt felt reminded of the bomb war and Shoah when they saw the now demolished Technical Town Hall.\u201d Most critics mocked questions of taste. \"It is often said that this type of architecture is just a backdrop, untrue, inauthentic ...

One of the main benefits of the project is the recovery of Braubachstrasse. In the past 70 years, practically no urban space has emerged that has the quality of the new old town. The ensemble effect is even better than originally thought. Suddenly the architects are on the defensive and have a professional discussion about their health. One could learn from the project for future new building projects \u201cthat one needs more depth in dealing with architecture. It can no longer be about creating volume. You have to provide identification with special design elements. You have to put more effort into the details \u201d. He opposes criticism that you could have built many social housing for the same money; this thinking is \"totally limited\". \u201cIt was a sensible investment, it brings the city forward. The foreigners in particular, who we led over the construction site, were of the opinion that the people of Frankfurt should have remembered their history as a European metropolis much earlier. \u201dHe personally likes the two new buildingsBest with ''the Three Romans'' (Markt 40) and ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8); the least successful are the ''Goldene Schachtel'' (Markt 32) and her neighbor ''Alter Burggraf'' .<ref>''Im Gespr\u00e4ch: Michael Guntersdorf, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer der Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH'', Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 27.

He recalls an earlier article that he wrote about the planned demolition of the Technical Town Hall and reconstructions in the old town for Die Zeit , and in which he made fun of the \u201chalf-timbered longing\u201d, the \u201clonging for a city like this looks like the cities that Frankfurt might like to visit as tourists \u201d. <ref>{{citation|surname1=Andreas Maier|periodical=[[Die Zeit]]|title=Fachwerk f\u00fcr Alle!|date=2006-05-18|language=German|url=https://www.zeit.de/2006/21/Archi_Frankfurt_xml/komplettansicht|access-date= 2018-11-23\n}}</ref> After a tour of the construction site, however, he was impressed by the quality of the construction and also the architecture, and the enthusiasm of the craftsmen.

The project redesigned and developed a 7,000 square meter property between [[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]] in the west and Domplatz in the east, delimited by Braubachstrasse in the north and the Schirn Kunsthalle in the south.  an effort to remake the old city centre, the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] (old town) of [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]], which was severely damaged during [[World War II]], in the style of the pre-war architecture.\n\nIt aims to give the old town quarter between the [[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]] square and the [[Frankfurt Cathedral|Cathedral]] (Dom) new life. The old city had already been thoroughly changed in 1904 by hewing several aisles for wide streets into the medieval cluster of insalubrious houses and small alley ways, clearing the way for a tramway line through the historic centre.\n\nDue to the heavy [[bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II]] with many [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] buildings, most of the city's old town was destroyed. The efforts to rebuild parts of it began in the 1950s with the [[R\u00f6mer]] city hall, which was built as a modern office building behind the old fa\u00e7ade still standing after the war, and parts of the surrounding [[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]] square, building an underground [[multi-storey car park]], and on top of that the modern ''Technisches Rathaus''<ref>[[c:Category:Technisches_Rathaus|Photos of the former Technisches Rathaus Frankfurt]]</ref> (''Technical City Hall'', built 1972\u201374), whose fa\u00e7ade paid homage to the historic context of the city with the [[timber frame|timber frame design (''Fachwerk'')]] of the pre-war architecture, but within the context of \"[[Brutalist architecture]]\". The ''Historisches Museum'' (Museum of city history) was also built, including a cinema.  In its entrance way, the museum displayed a model of the old centre as it looked at the end of World War II; in ruins.\n\nThe anti-[[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] movement continued in a public campaign to demolish the {{lang|de|Technische Rathaus}} and to make the old city look like before the war. This did finally succeed, the {{lang|de|Technisches Rathaus}} and the Museum of City History were demolished in 2010/2011, and the reconstruction of the old town core began.\n\nThe project is being built on top of a 1970s underground multi-storey car park and the [[U-Bahn Line B (Frankfurt U-Bahn)|U-Bahn Line B]] station underneath. Because of the demolition of the ''Technisches Rathaus'', the underground moved and the tunnel had to be monitored closely and corrected several times.\n\nCivic engagement in particular led to the old-town-oriented planning of the Dom-R\u00f6mer project.<ref>{{citation|periodical=[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]|title=Neue Altstadt Frankfurt|date=2018-05-09|language=German|url=http://www.fr.de/Neue+Altstadt+Frankfurt./ |access-date=2018-05-11\n}}</ref> The 35 designs of new buildings were 2010/11 in several architectural competitions determined with more than 170 participants.

The areas marked in dark red were torn down in 1927.]]\n[[File:Frankfurt 1945 June destructions after bombing raids old town aerial.JPG|thumb|The destroyed old town in June 1945]]\nDuring the Second World War, the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] old town of Frankfurt am Main , until then one of the best preserved in Central Europe, was almost completely destroyed by bombing. Only a few historical buildings remained, and in the [[History of Germany (1945\u20131990)|post-war]] period, other damaged buildings were also demolished, mostly in favour of \"car-friendly\" traffic planning. There were very few external reconstructions of buildings and the majority of the former old town was rebuilt in the style of the 1950s, largely leaving the historic street network behind.\n\nOnly the area between R\u00f6merberg and the cathedral remained after the rubble clearance wasteland, over whose development has long been debated. In the meantime, from 1953, archaeologists were able to uncover the remains of a Roman settlement, but also recent traces, especially from the Carolingian period, beneath the area of the high medieval layers . A centuries-long search for the origin of the city was therefore over, although the Royal Palatinate Frankfurt, which had previously only been handed down through documents, was not built by the legendary founder of Frankfurt, Charlemagne, but, according to findings, only by his son, Ludwig the Pious .\n\nIn 1966 construction began on the B section of the Frankfurt subway between the main train station and the Konstablerwache. The line of the new underground also led through the old town, with a station under the previously undeveloped area used as a parking lot between the cathedral and the Roman. When the Dom/R\u00f6mer underground station was built in 1970/71, due to the open construction method, it was accepted to destroy a large part of the oldest settlement floor in Frankfurt, which had not yet been archaeologically examined.\n\nSubsequently, after years of discussion on the site, the Technical City Hall was created in 1972\u20131974 as the seat of the technical offices of the city administration. Five old town houses on Braubachstrasse that had survived the war were demolished to excavate the construction pit. The building, built in the brutalist architectural style, represented with its enormous dimensions, dominated the former old town, not taking into account of the small-scale buildings in the area. The construction costs totalled DM 93 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wortprotokoll \u00fcber die 19. Plenarsitzung der Stadtverordnetenversammlung am Donnerstag, dem 15.

After the construction work was completed, the ceiling of the underground car park formed the new level, which was now about two meters above the historical floor level. The archaeological finds of the old town excavation from 1953, dating from the early days of Frankfurt, also initially removed, were preserved and made accessible to the public as an archaeological garden .\n\nIn 1994 the city of Frankfurt sold the Technical City Hall for DM 148 million to Deutsche Immobilien Leasing (DIL), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. At the same time, the building was leased back to the city with the option that the city could buy back the town hall for DM 135 million after the lease expired in 2006, a so-called sale-lease-back agreement.<ref name=\"faz.net-20041108\">{{cite news|title=Stadtplanung \u2013 Umbau statt Abri\u00df \u2013 neue Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr Technisches Rathaus in Frankfurt|newspaper=faz.net|publisher=|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/frankfurt/stadtplanung-umbau-statt-abriss-neue-plaene-fuer-technisches-rathaus-in-frankfurt-1194573.html|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=2004-11-08|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Planning History ==\n\n=== 2004\u20132006 ===\n[[File:Technischesrathaus-ffm001.jpg|thumb|Technical City Hall, 2007]]\nIn 2004, the project developers ''Max Baum Immobilien'' and ''Gro\u00df & Partner,'' on behalf of the owner DIL, presented plans for a renovation of the 30-year-old technical town hall . According to plans by the Frankfurt office of ''Stefan Forster Architects'', the building complex was to be divided into two houses by an alley from Braubachstrasse to the roundel of the Schirn Kunsthallebe to be created. For the concrete facades, a completely new design with a perforated facade made of natural stone was planned, for future use in the four-story base the city library as well as shops and restaurants. In addition, around 160 apartments were to be created in the three towers. The leasing contract with the city could have been extended to 20 years, subject to the modified use of the building.<ref name=\"faz.net-20041108\" />\n[[File:Technisches-Rathaus-Frankfurt 2007 LWS0780.jpg|thumb|The facades of the technical town hall, July 2008]]\n[[File:Frankfurt Altstadt-Goldene Waage.jpg|thumb|House of the Golden Libra , around 1900]]\nThe city council then decided in December 2004 to carry out an urban planning ideas competition in which both variants (renovation or demolition with subsequent small-scale development) were to be run through.

The following requirements were then set for the urban planning competition: small-scale buildings with facades and roofs that fit harmoniously into the old town, housing 20,000 m\u00b2 of gross floor space within the property boundaries of the Technical City Hall, overbuilding of the archaeological garden with 7,000 m\u00b2, continued use of the archaeological site Garden with the remains of the Royal Palatinate and the restoration of the old \"coronation path\" between the cathedral and the Roman. The name \"Coronation Trail\", an alternative name for the alley ''market''(also known as the ''Old Market'' ), which existed until 1945, arose from the fact that a total of 16 coronation ceremonies for Roman-German kings were held in Frankfurt from the 14th to the 18th century. 20 offices took part in the urban planning competition.<ref name=\"faz.net\">[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/architektur-abriss-des-technischen-rathauses-gesichert-1256606.html ''Abri\u00df des Technischen Rathauses gesichert.''] In: ''faz.net'', 25.

These provided that the city would not buy back the property, but that the leasing model would continue.<ref name=\"faz.net\" />\n\nIn August 2005, the Free Voters in the R\u00f6mer submitted an application for the planned Dom-R\u00f6mer area to approach the historic streets and squares and to reconstruct some important buildings in terms of urban planning, such as the ''Haus zur Goldenen Waage'' or the ''Haus zum Esslinger'' ( also known as ''Young Esslinger'' or ''Aunt Melber's house'' ). However, the winning design chosen by the Frankfurt office KSP Engel and Zimmermann in September 2005 met only a few of these requirements. The \"Coronation Trail\" was not laid out along the course of the market, which was even largely respected by the construction of the Technical Town Hall in 1972, but in a straight diagonal fromStone house to the cathedral tower.

With its ground floor structure consisting essentially of only three oak columns, which bore the entire weight of the three-story building above it, the New Red House was unique in the entire German half-timbered landscape and a well-known attraction far beyond the city. It was considered an outstanding example of medieval town planning and community spirit in the lively center of the old town. The Red House formed the passage to ''Tuchgaden'' and stood at the entrance to the butcher's quarter on the ''Lange Schirn'', at which the Frankfurter sausages have been sold since ancient times . The new building is also used by a butcher, which also has a sales stand in the Kleinmarkthalle .\n\nSouth of the new row of houses on the market, the ''town house'' consisting of five building parts was built ''on the market'' from 2013 to 2016 . The design comes from ''Meurer Architects'' , Frankfurt, with ''cba architectes'' , Luxembourg. The town house serves on the one hand to permanently preserve and make accessible the archaeological excavations of the Roman settlement on the cathedral hill and the imperial palace Franconofurd ; on the other hand as a meeting and event building. The end of the building complex to the west to the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt is ''House 5'' , a residential building. It is based on the course of the historic alley of ''Tuchgaden'' .\n\nThere is a height difference of more than two meters between the street level of the reconstructed Old Market and today's Bendergasse along the Schirn. It is made clear in the section between the New Red House and the western entrance to the Dom / R\u00f6mer underground station by a wall and pergola made of sandstone. Due to the protruding rotunda of the Schirn, there was not enough space in this section for a southern row of houses opposite the Markt 26 to Markt 40 houses. Before the destruction narrow alleys chain in this section three ''Goldhutgasse'' , ''Drachengasse'' and ''sword-alley'' to the south, the south of it at the Five Finger Square met again.\n\n=== Rebstock-Hof ===\n[[File:Dom-Roemer-Projekt-Hof zum-Rebstock-0918.jpg|thumb|''Hof zum Rebstock'' , left part of the back of ''Markt 2'']]\nThe east side of the Rebstock-Hof is the Haus am Dom , which was built from 2001 to 2004 through the renovation and expansion of the ''main customs office'' built by Werner Hebebrand in 1927 . Even though it was built as part of the New Frankfurt project , the main customs office already received a steep, curved gable roof as a tribute to the surrounding old town development, which was retained during the renovation. The house at the cathedral was extended at the southern end during the renovation, so that it protrudes a few meters from the historic building of the ''old market'' and comes closer to the reconstructed ''golden scales'' . The neighboring house ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock''(Market 8), however, keeps the original parcel. The northern entrance to the Rebstock-Hof lies between the two buildings. The north side of it is the new building ''Rebstock-Hof 2'' (Markt 2, formerly Im Rebstock 2),<ref>{{cite web|title=Markt 2 (Rebstock-Hof 2)|periodical=Dom-R\u00f6mer GMBH|publisher=|url=https://www.domroemer.de/markt-2|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-11-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref> a residential and commercial building by ''Meurer'' , Frankfurt. With a sand-colored plastered facade and slate roof, it looks like an extension to the house on the cathedral.

The gable roof is divided by a dwarf house with a Rhenish wave gable and two rows of dormer windows. The non-profit Frankfurt association runs a senior caf\u00e9 on the ground floor of the courtyard facing the vine .

The three-storey Renaissance building from the 16th century was designed by ''Dreysse Architects'' , Frankfurt am Main and ''Jourdan & M\u00fcller'', Frankfurt am Main, reconstructed. The vaulted hall, whose six cross vaults rest on two central pillars, is a reminder of its former importance as a trade fair building . The new building is used by the Evangelical Regional Association Frankfurt am Main as the parish hall of the Paulsgemeinde and the Indonesian community.\n\nThe only reconstruction on the south side of the alley is the house ''Goldene Schere'' (Markt 22, side entrance, formerly Hinter dem L\u00e4mmchen 1) by the architects ''Hans Kollhoff'' , Berlin and ''Jourdan & M\u00fcller'' , Frankfurt am Main.<ref name=\"domroemer.de\"/> The four-story building in classicist forms was created in the 18th century by conversion from two older predecessor buildings.

The lines of argumentation often followed the same pattern as since the beginning of the reconstruction debate immediately after the destruction. Dieter Bartetzko compares the old town with an unfathomably deep fountain that draws on the myths of the past and gives life in the present. He recalls that the fountain on the chicken market was drilled as early as Roman times and that the Carolingian people were probably already aware that they lived on historical ground. This explains why Frankfurt was referred to in its first documentary mention in 794 as a ''locus celeber'' , a ''celebrated site'' . He describes the old town withNietzsche as an architectural palimpsest that always keeps the memory of the past in the minds of city dwellers, no matter how often it is overwritten. He explains this thesis using the example of the new building at ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8) and the reconstruction at ''Braubachstra\u00dfe 21'' . In contrast, the Technical City Hall, \"rammed as a concrete juggernaut in the middle of the previously closed row of houses on Braubachstrasse\", had remained a provocative and ignorant foreign body in the urban fabric for decades. In spite of its architectural quality, this was his doom.<ref>Dieter Bartetzko: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/umbaumassnahmen-in-der-frankfurter-altstadt-13531714.html ''Mut zum Traum''], in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 11.

It was \"scandalous that the initiative of a right-wing radical without any significant civil society resistance led to a slick neighborhood with seemingly seamless repeat architectures\".

One of the main benefits of the project is the recovery of Braubachstrasse. In the past 70 years, practically no urban space has emerged that has the quality of the new old town. The ensemble effect is even better than originally thought. Suddenly the architects are on the defensive and have a professional discussion about their health. One could learn from the project for future new building projects \u201cthat one needs more depth in dealing with architecture. It can no longer be about creating volume. You have to provide identification with special design elements. You have to put more effort into the details \u201d. He opposes criticism that you could have built many social housing for the same money; this thinking is \"totally limited\". \u201cIt was a sensible investment, it brings the city forward. The foreigners in particular, who we led over the construction site, were of the opinion that the people of Frankfurt should have remembered their history as a European metropolis much earlier. \u201dHe personally likes the two new buildingsBest with ''the Three Romans'' (Markt 40) and ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8); the least successful are the ''Goldene Schachtel'' (Markt 32) and her neighbor ''Alter Burggraf'' .<ref>''Im Gespr\u00e4ch: Michael Guntersdorf, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer der Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH'', Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 27.

He recalls an earlier article that he wrote about the planned demolition of the Technical Town Hall and reconstructions in the old town for Die Zeit , and in which he made fun of the \u201chalf-timbered longing\u201d, the \u201clonging for a city like this looks like the cities that Frankfurt might like to visit as tourists \u201d. <ref>{{citation|surname1=Andreas Maier|periodical=[[Die Zeit]]|title=Fachwerk f\u00fcr Alle!|date=2006-05-18|language=German|url=https://www.zeit.de/2006/21/Archi_Frankfurt_xml/komplettansicht|access-date= 2018-11-23\n}}</ref> After a tour of the construction site, however, he was impressed by the quality of the construction and also the architecture, and the enthusiasm of the craftsmen. He states: \u201cValuable materials, traditional craftsmanship, everything at its finest. With its new old town, which is also in the ManufactumCatalog, Frankfurt makes itself a gift. And there is the Belvederchen as praline on top. \u201dIn addition to the Belvederchen, he is particularly impressed by the ''Sch\u00f6nau'' house (Market 10) -\u201c a very narrow thing with a slate facade pulled down deep\u2026 and a slightly convex curvature of the elegantly stepped front. Probably an absolutely unique piece. \"\n\n== Literature ==\n\n=== Summaries ===\n\n* Matthias Alexander (Hrsg.): ''Die neue Altstadt.''
