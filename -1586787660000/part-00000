[[Yuri Bogatyryov]] had only one free day, so he invented his costume and changed closes on the way from Moscow to Leningrad, thus upon arrival everyone witnessed a 19th-century nobleman casually walking out of a Soviet train.<ref>''[[Vitaly Melnikov (film director)|Vitaly Melnikov]] (2011)''.

The only difficulty was getting from under the antique bed which could've collapsed anytime, so [[Stanislav Sadalsky]] had to stay down there. He was then joined by [[Oleg Tabakov]], and during pauses both of them simply fell asleep. [[Yuri Bogatyryov]] had only one free day, so he invented his costume and changed closes on the way from Moscow to Leningrad, thus upon arrival everyone witnessed a 19th-century nobleman casually walking out of a Soviet train.<ref>''[[Vitaly Melnikov]] (2011)''.

Project costs had been heavily optimised over several years, down from prior estimates of $300-400 million AUD.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2019, the proponents were seeking $10 million in Federal funding to develop a feasibility study for the project.

Centrex Metals' preferred method for the long-term transport of ore to the port is via a slurry pipeline. A [[desalination plant]] capable of producing of 5-20 gigalitres of water per year would have been required to provide the water necessary to transport the ore in a slurry to the Port Spencer site. Once the ore is dewatered, it would be loaded onto conveyors, along a {{convert|500|m|adj=on}} jetty and onto [[capesize]] bulk carrier vessels.<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/epbc/epbc_ap.pl?name=current_referral_detail&proposal_id=6590 EPBC Act Referral Detail - Port Spencer] ''Government of Australia, Department of the Environment.

The jetty would be supported by ten pylons, and the total cost of the development was estimated to be $130 million AUD. Project costs had been heavily optimised over several years, down from prior estimates of $300-400 million AUD.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2019, the proponents were seeking $10 million in Federal funding to develop a feasibility study for the project. The prospect of funding such a project was challenged by Senator [[Rex Patrick]], who believes that supporting the Cape Hardy port proposal less than ten kilometres to the north would be a better investment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eyretribune.com.au/story/6104913/patrick-questions-port-funding/|title=Patrick questions port funding|last=Dinning|first=Lauren|date=2019-05-03|website=Eyre Peninsula Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\n== Environmental approval process ==\nCentrex Metals' port development proposal required three stages of environmental approvals plus associated mine development approvals before ultimately being abandoned by its original proponents.\n* The South Australian [[Development Assessment Commission]] deemed it appropriate for the project to produce two stages of documentation in the form of Public Environment Reports for [[South Australian Government]] approval.<ref>South Australian Government [http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/Housing%2C+property+and+land/Building+and+development/Building+and+development+applications/Major+development+applications+and+assessments/Major+development+proposals/Sheep+Hill+deep+water+port+facility+(Stage+1)+on+Eyre+Peninsula Major Development Proposals - Sheep Hill deep water port (stage 1)] (accessed 2013-11-04)</ref>\n* The Federal [[Australian Government]] also deemed it necessary for[Centrex Metals to obtain Federal environmental approval for Port Spencer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The Federal Environment Department required Centrex Metals Ltd to respond to identified risks to two threatened species known to visit the region- the [[southern right whale]] and the [[fairy tern]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe development of Port Spencer was also dependent on the advancement of the [[Fusion Magnetite Project]], which required its own environmental approvals at both State and Federal levels. As of 2018, the associated mine has not been developed, and the project site is now being considered by Free Eyre, as a potential grain export facility.
