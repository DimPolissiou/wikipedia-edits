Throughout the 1990s, that trio would form the nucleus of the Australian Boomers front court with Longley at centre, 6'10\" (208&nbsp;cm) Bradtke at [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]], and 6'7\" (201&nbsp;cm) Vlahov at [[small forward]].\n\nWhen Longley returned home to Perth during college breaks, he regularly suited up for the Perth Redbacks, helping the team to consecutive [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) championships in 1989 and 1990.\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Minnesota Timberwolves===\nLongley was drafted 7th overall by the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in [[1991 NBA Draft|1991]].

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech.

Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and non metals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical peroperties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, pioneering research into [[quantum mechanics]] led to new developments in atomic theory and small changes to the periodic table. The [[Bohr model]] was developed during this time, and championed the idea of [[electron configuration]]s that determine chemical properties.

This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical peroperties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, pioneering research into [[quantum mechanics]] led to new developments in atomic theory and small changes to the periodic table. The [[Bohr model]] was developed during this time, and championed the idea of [[electron configuration]]s that determine chemical properties.

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively.

Innovations from the late 19th century generally parallel developments in [[mass production]] in other industries in the latter part of the [[Industrial Revolution]].  The discovery of [[vitamin]]s and their role in animal [[nutrition]], in the first two decades of the 20th century, led to vitamin supplements, which allowed chickens to be raised indoors.<ref name=\"John Steele Gordon 1996\">[[John Steele Gordon]] (1996) \"The Chicken Story\", American Heritage, September 1996: 52\u201367</ref> The discovery of [[antibiotic]]s and [[vaccine]]s facilitated raising livestock in larger numbers by reducing disease. Chemicals developed for use in [[World War II]] gave rise to synthetic [[pesticide]]s. Developments in shipping networks and technology have made long-distance distribution of agricultural produce feasible.\n\nAgricultural production across the world doubled four times between 1820 and 1975 (1820 to 1920; 1920 to 1950; 1950 to 1965; and 1965 to 1975) to feed a global population of one billion human beings in 1800 and 6.5 billion in 2002.<ref name=dominion>Matthew Scully  [https://books.google.com/books/about/Dominion.html?id=4lSplJlgc_sC Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy] Macmillan, 2002</ref>{{rp|29}}  During the same period, the number of people involved in farming dropped as the process became more automated.

The aim is to produce large quantities of meat, eggs, or milk at the lowest possible cost. Food is supplied in place. Methods employed to maintain health and improve production may include the use of disinfectants, antimicrobial agents, anthelmintics, hormones and vaccines; protein, mineral and vitamin supplements; frequent health inspections; [[biosecurity]]; and climate-controlled facilities. Physical restraints, e.g. fences or creeps, are used to control movement or actions regarded as undesirable. Breeding programs are used to produce animals more suited to the confined conditions and able to provide a consistent food product.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Eating Animals |date=2010 |publisher=Hachette Book Group USA |authorlink= Jonathan Safran Foer |last=Foer |first=Jonathan Safran |isbn=978-0316127165 |oclc=669754727}}</ref>\n\nIntensive production of livestock and poultry is widespread in [[developed nation]]s.

Before this, chickens did not thrive during the winter (due to lack of sunlight), and egg production, incubation, and meat production in the off-season were all very difficult, making poultry a seasonal and expensive proposition. Year-round production lowered costs, especially for broilers.\n\nAt the same time, egg production was increased by scientific breeding. After a few false starts, (such as the Maine Experiment Station's failure at improving egg production) success was shown by Professor Dryden at the Oregon Experiment Station.<ref>Dryden, James. ''Poultry Breeding and Management''. Orange Judd Press, 1916.</ref>\n\nImprovements in production and quality were accompanied by lower labor requirements. In the 1930s through the early 1950s, 1,500 hens provided a full-time job for a farm family in America. In the late 1950s, egg prices had fallen so dramatically that farmers typically tripled the number of hens they kept, putting three hens into what had been a single-bird cage or converting their floor-confinement houses from a single deck of roosts to triple-decker roosts. Not long after this, prices fell still further and large numbers of egg farmers left the business. This fall in profitability was accompanied by a general fall in prices to the consumer, allowing poultry and eggs to lose their status as luxury foods.\n\nRobert Plamondon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plamondon.com|title=Plamondon.com: the home of Robert Plamondon and all his works!|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref> reports that the last family chicken farm in his part of Oregon, Rex Farms, had 30,000 layers and survived into the 1990s. However, the standard laying house of the current operators is around 125,000 hens.\n\nThe [[vertical integration]] of the egg and poultry industries was a late development, occurring after all the major technological changes had been in place for years (including the development of modern broiler rearing techniques, the adoption of the [[Cornish cross|Cornish Cross]] broiler, the use of laying cages, etc.).\n\nBy the late 1950s, poultry production had changed dramatically. Large farms and packing plants could grow birds by the tens of thousands. Chickens could be sent to [[slaughterhouse]]s for butchering and processing into prepackaged commercial products to be frozen or shipped fresh to markets or wholesalers. Meat-type chickens currently grow to market weight in six to seven weeks, whereas only fifty years ago it took three times as long.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Havenstein | first1 = G.B. | last2 = Ferket | first2 = P.R. | last3 = Qureshi | first3 = M.A. | year = 2003a | title = \"Growth, livability, and feed conversion of 1957 versus 2001 broilers when fed representative 1957 and 2001 broiler diets\".

Once a meat consumed only occasionally, the common availability and lower cost has made chicken a common meat product within developed nations. Growing concerns over the [[cholesterol]] content of [[red meat]] in the 1980s and 1990s further resulted in increased consumption of chicken.\n\nToday, eggs are produced on large egg ranches on which environmental parameters are well controlled. Chickens are exposed to artificial light cycles to stimulate egg production year-round. In addition, [[forced molting]] is commonly practiced in the US, in which manipulation of light and food access triggers molting, in order to increase egg size and production. Forced molting is controversial, and is prohibited in the EU.<ref name=\"Wigley\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2013/s/salmonella.pdf |publisher=Compassion in World Farming |title=Salmonella |author=Wigley, P. |year=2013 |access-date=March 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216160101/https://www.ciwf.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2013/s/salmonella.pdf |archive-date=February 16, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn average, a chicken lays one egg a day, but not on every day of the year. This varies with the breed and time of year. In 1900, average egg production was 83 eggs per hen per year. In 2000, it was well over 300. In the United States, laying hens are butchered after their second egg laying season. In Europe, they are generally butchered after a single season. The laying period begins when the hen is about 18\u201320 weeks old (depending on breed and season). Males of the egg-type breeds have little commercial value at any age, and all those not used for breeding (roughly fifty percent of all egg-type chickens) are [[Chick culling|killed]] soon after hatching. The old hens also have little commercial value. Thus, the main sources of poultry meat 100 years ago (spring chickens and stewing hens) have both been entirely supplanted by meat-type broiler chickens.\n\n===Pigs===\n{{Main|Intensive pig farming}}\n[[File:Hog confinement barn interior.jpg|thumb |Pigs confined to a barn in an intensive system, [[Midwestern United States]]]]\n\nIntensive piggeries (or hog lots) are a type of what in America is called a [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation]] (CAFO), specialized for the raising of [[domestic pig]]s up to slaughterweight. In this system, grower pigs are housed indoors in group-housing or straw-lined sheds, whilst pregnant sows are confined in sow stalls ([[gestation crate]]s) and give birth in [[farrowing crate]]s.\n\nThe use of sow stalls has resulted in lower production costs and concomitant [[animal welfare]] concerns. Many of the world's largest producers of pigs (such as [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]]) use sow stalls, but some nations (such as the [[United Kingdom|UK]]) and [[U.S. state]]s (such as [[Florida]] and [[Arizona]]) have banned them.\n\nIntensive piggeries are generally large warehouse-like buildings. Indoor pig systems allow the pig's condition to be monitored, ensuring minimum fatalities and increased productivity. Buildings are ventilated and their temperature regulated. Most domestic pig varieties are susceptible to heat stress, and all pigs lack sweat glands and cannot cool themselves. Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death. Maintaining a more specific temperature within the pig-tolerance range also maximizes growth and growth to feed ratio. In an intensive operation pigs will lack access to a wallow (mud), which is their natural cooling mechanism.  Intensive piggeries control temperature through ventilation or drip water systems (dropping water to cool the system).\n\nPigs are naturally omnivorous and are generally fed a combination of grains and protein sources (soybeans, or [[meat and bone meal]]). Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed-grain crops are grown. Alternatively, piggeries are reliant on the grains industry. Pig feed may be bought packaged or mixed on-site. The intensive piggery system, where pigs are confined in individual stalls, allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed. The individual feeding system also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed. This has more significance to intensive farming methods, as the close proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly. To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth, drug programs such as [[antibiotic]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[hormone]]s and other supplements are preemptively administered.\n\nIndoor systems, especially stalls and pens (i.e. \u2018dry,\u2019 not straw-lined systems) allow for the easy collection of waste. In an indoor intensive pig farm, manure can be managed through a lagoon system or other waste-management system. However, odor remains a problem which is difficult to manage.\n\nThe way animals are housed in intensive systems varies. Breeding sows spend the bulk of their time in sow stalls during pregnancy or farrowing crates, with their litters, until market.\n\nPiglets often receive range of treatments including castration, tail docking to reduce tail biting, teeth clipped (to reduce injuring their mother's nipples, gum disease and prevent later tusk growth) and their ears notched to assist identification. Treatments are usually made without pain killers. Weak [[runt]]s may be slain shortly after birth.\n\nPiglets also may be [[wean]]ed and removed from the sows at between two and five weeks old<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalhogfarmer.com/mag/farming_revisiting_weaning_age |title=Revisiting Weaning Age Trends, Dynamics |date=October 15, 2005}}</ref> and placed in sheds. However, grower pigs \u2013 which comprise the bulk of the herd \u2013 are usually housed in alternative indoor housing, such as batch pens.  During pregnancy, the use of a stall may be preferred as it facilitates feed-management and growth control. It also prevents pig aggression (e.g. tail biting, ear biting, vulva biting, food stealing). Group pens generally require higher stockmanship skills.  Such pens will usually not contain straw or other material. Alternatively, a straw-lined shed may house a larger group (i.e. not batched) in age groups.\n\n===Cattle===\n[[File:Feedlot-1.jpg|left|thumb|Beef [[cattle]] on a [[feedlot]] in the [[Texas Panhandle]].

The feed also contains premixes composed of microingredients such as vitamins, minerals, chemical preservatives, [[Antibiotic use in livestock|antibiotics]], fermentation products, and other essential ingredients that are purchased from premix companies, usually in sacked form, for blending into commercial rations. Because of the availability of these products, a farmer using their own grain can formulate their own rations and be assured the animals are getting the recommended levels of minerals and vitamins.\n\nThere are many potential impacts on human health due to the modern cattle industrial agriculture system. There are concerns surrounding the antibiotics and growth hormones used, increased ''E. coli'' contamination, higher saturated fat contents in the meat because of the feed, and also environmental concerns.<ref>Pollan, Michael. 2002.

Fewer producers participate in the finishing phase which often occurs in a [[feedlot]], but nonetheless there are 82,170 feedlots in the United States.<ref>National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Agricultural Statistics Board, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 2010; [http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/USCatSup/USCatSup-12-17-2010.pdf Overview of the United States Cattle Industry]</ref>\n\n===Aquaculture===\n{{main|Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture}}\n[[File:IMTA cultured mussels (Mytilus edulis) in the Bay of Fundy Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Mytilus edulis|Blue mussels]] cultivated in proximity to [[Salmo salar|Atlantic salmon]] in the [[Bay of Fundy]], Canada]]\n\nIntegrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), also called integrated aquaculture,<ref name=\"Neori et al. 2004\"/> is a practice in which the by-products (wastes) from one species are recycled to become inputs ([[fertilizer]]s, food) for another, making [[aquaculture]] intensive. Fed aquaculture (e.g. fish and [[shrimp]]) is combined with inorganic extractive (e.g. [[seaweed]]) and organic extractive (e.g. [[shellfish]]) aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability (biomitigation), economic stability (product diversification and risk reduction) and social acceptability (better management practices).<ref name=\"Chopin et al. 2001\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chopin | first1 = T | last2 = Buschmann | first2 = AH | last3 = Halling | first3 = C | last4 = Troell | first4 = M | last5 = Kautsky | first5 = N | last6 = Neori | first6 = A | last7 = Kraemer | first7 = GP | last8 = Zertuche-Gonzalez | first8 = JA | last9 = Yarish | first9 = C | last10 = Neefus | first10 = C | year = 2001 | title = Integrating seaweeds into marine aquaculture systems: a key toward sustainability | url = | journal = Journal of Phycology | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 975\u2013986 }}</ref>\n\nThe system is multi-trophic as it makes use of [[species]] from different [[trophic level|trophic]] or [[nutritional]] level, unlike traditional aquaculture.<ref name=\"Chopin 2006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chopin | first1 = T | year = 2006 | title = Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.

In the United States, a [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation]] (CAFO) that discharges or proposes to discharge waste requires a permit and implementation of a plan for management of manure nutrients, contaminants, wastewater, etc., as applicable, to meet requirements pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act.<ref name=CAFOCDCP>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061021104950/https://www.cdc.gov/cafos/about.htm \"Concentrated animal feeding operations\"], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Health and Human Services.</ref><ref>US Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 122.42(e)</ref>  Some data on regulatory compliance and enforcement are available. In 2000, the US Environmental Protection Agency published 5-year and 1-year data on environmental performance of 32 industries, with data for the livestock industry being derived mostly from inspections of CAFOs.  The data pertain to inspections and enforcement mostly under the Clean Water Act, but also under the Clean Air Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Of the 32 industries, livestock production was among the top seven for environmental performance over the 5-year period, and was one of the top two in the final year of that period, where good environmental performance is indicated by a low ratio of enforcement orders to inspections. The five-year and final-year ratios of enforcement/inspections for the livestock industry were 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.  Also in the final year, the livestock industry was one of the two leaders among the 32 industries in terms of having the lowest  percentage of facilities with violations.<ref>US EPA. 2000. Profile of the agricultural livestock production industry. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Office of Compliance. EPA/310-R-00-002. 156 pp.</ref> In Canada, intensive livestock operations are subject to provincial regulation, with definitions of regulated entities varying among provinces. Examples include Intensive Livestock Operations (Saskatchewan), Confined Feeding Operations (Alberta), Feedlots (British Columbia), High-density Permanent Outdoor Confinement Areas (Ontario) and Feedlots or Parcs d'Engraissement (Manitoba). In Canada, intensive animal production, like other agricultural sectors, is also subject to various other federal and provincial requirements.\n\nIn the United States, farmed animals are excluded by half of all state [[animal cruelty]] laws including the federal [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]]. The 28-hour law, enacted in 1873 and amended in 1994 states that when animals are being transported for slaughter, the vehicle must stop every 28 hours and the animals must be let out for exercise, food, and water. The United States Department of Agriculture claims that the law does not apply to birds. The [[Humane Slaughter Act]] is similarly limited. Originally passed in 1958, the Act requires that livestock be stunned into unconsciousness prior to slaughter. This Act also excludes birds, who make up more than 90 percent of the animals slaughtered for food, as well as [[rabbit]]s and fish. Individual states all have their own animal cruelty statutes; however many states have a provision to exempt standard agricultural practices.<ref>[http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=1027] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928151011/http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=1027 |date=September 28, 2011 }} ALDF Farmed Animals and the Law</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusfd7usca1901.htm |title=US \u2013 Food Animal \u2013 Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter |publisher= Animal Legal & Historical Center |website=www.animallaw.info}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States there is an attempt to regulate farms in the most realistic way possible. The easiest way to effectively regulate the most animals with a limited number of resources and time is to regulate the large farms. In New York State many Animal Feeding Operations are not considered CAFOs since they either have less than 300 cows. These farms are not regulated to the level that CAFOs are. This can lead to pollution and nutrient leaching.

Through \"forward contracts\" and \"marketing agreements\", meatpackers are able to set the price of livestock long before they are ready for production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/this-cattlemans-got-a-beef/Content?oid=1121453|title=This Cattleman's Got a Beef|work=Colorado Springs Independent|date=November 20, 2003|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> These strategies often cause farmers to lose money, as half of all U.S. family farming operations did in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foodandwater.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/FactoryFarmNation-web.pdf|title=''Factory Farm Nation: How America Turned its Livestock Farms into Factories''|date=November 2010|accessdate=July 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522140235/http://foodandwater.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/FactoryFarmNation-web.pdf|archive-date=May 22, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, there were one million pig farms in America; as of 2002, there were 114,000.<ref name=dominion/>{{rp|29}}\n\nMany of the nation's livestock producers would like to market livestock directly to consumers but with limited USDA inspected slaughter facilities, livestock grown locally can not typically be slaughtered and processed locally.<ref>Testimony by Leland Swenson, president of the U.S. National Farmers' Union, before the House Judiciary Committee, September 12, 2000.</ref>\n\n===Demonstrations===\n\nFrom 2011 to 2014 each year between 15,000 and 30,000 people gathered under the theme ''[[We are fed up]]!'' in Berlin to protest against industrial livestock production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/berlin-protests-focus-on-farming-and-food-safety-1.1316948|title=Berlin protests focus on farming and food safety|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.dw.de/protesters-in-berlin-call-for-an-end-to-factory-farming/a-14780207-1 Deutsche Welle, ''Protesters in Berlin call for an end to factory farming'', 22 January 2011]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/farmers-defend-themselves-at-berlins-green-week/a-17369859|title=Farmers defend themselves at Berlin\u2032s Green Week |date=January 17, 2014|work=DW.COM|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Animal industrial complex]]\n* [[Animal rights movement]]\n* [[Animal welfare]]\n* [[Battery cage]]\n* [[Cattle Health Initiative]]\n* [[Controlled-atmosphere killing]]\n* [[Cultured meat]]\n* [[Environmental vegetarianism]]\n* [[Farm Sanctuary]]\n* [[Food systems]]\n* [[Gestation crate]]\n* [[Humane Slaughter Act]]\n* [[List of foodborne illness outbreaks]]\n* [[List of United States foodborne illness outbreaks]]\n* [[Meat Atlas]]\n* [[Mercy for Animals]]\n* [[Organic farming]]\n* [[Small-scale agriculture]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Anomaly |first1=Jonathan |date=2015 |title=What's Wrong with Factory Farming? |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=246\u2013334 |journal=Public Health Ethics|url=https://philpapers.org/archive/ANOWWW.pdf|doi=10.1093/phe/phu001 |hdl=10161/9733 }}\n* {{cite book| last = Crawford| first = Dorothy | title = Deadly Companions: How Microbes Shaped our History| date = 2018| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| location = Oxford, UK}}\n* [https://www.animal-ethics.org/animals-used-food-introduction Animals Used for Food \u2013 Animal Ethics]\n* [http://nationalaglawcenter.org/research-by-topic/afo/ National Agriculture Law Center \u2013 Animal Feeding Operations]\n* [http://www.foe.co.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/factory_farming.pdf Factory farming\u2019s hidden impacts]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/24/calls-to-reform-food-system-factory-farming-belongs-in-a-museum Calls to reform food system: 'Factory farming belongs in a museum'].

Innovations from the late 19th century generally parallel developments in [[mass production]] in other industries in the latter part of the [[Industrial Revolution]].  The discovery of [[vitamin]]s and their role in animal [[nutrition]], in the first two decades of the 20th century, led to vitamin supplements, which allowed chickens to be raised indoors.<ref name=\"John Steele Gordon 1996\">[[John Steele Gordon]] (1996) \"The Chicken Story\", American Heritage, September 1996: 52\u201367</ref> The discovery of [[antibiotic]]s and [[vaccine]]s facilitated raising livestock in larger numbers by reducing disease. Chemicals developed for use in [[World War II]] gave rise to synthetic [[pesticide]]s. Developments in shipping networks and technology have made long-distance distribution of agricultural produce feasible.\n\nAgricultural production across the world doubled four times between 1820 and 1975 (1820 to 1920; 1920 to 1950; 1950 to 1965; and 1965 to 1975) to feed a global population of one billion human beings in 1800 and 6.5 billion in 2002.<ref name=dominion>Matthew Scully  [https://books.google.com/books/about/Dominion.html?id=4lSplJlgc_sC Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy] Macmillan, 2002</ref>{{rp|29}}  During the same period, the number of people involved in farming dropped as the process became more automated. In the 1930s, 24 percent of the American population worked in agriculture compared to 1.5 percent in 2002; in 1940, each farm worker supplied 11 consumers, whereas in 2002, each worker supplied 90 consumers.<ref name=dominion/>{{rp|29}}\n\nThe era of factory farming in Britain began in 1947 when a new [[Agriculture Act 1947|Agriculture Act]] granted subsidies to farmers to encourage greater output by introducing new technology, in order to reduce Britain's reliance on imported meat. The United Nations writes that \"intensification of animal production was seen as a way of providing food security.\"<ref>[http://www.unsystem.org/SCN/archives/scnnews21/ch04.htm#TopOfPage \"The History of Factory Farming\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116060714/http://www.unsystem.org/SCN/archives/scnnews21/ch04.htm |date=November 16, 2013 }}, United Nations.</ref> In 1966, the United States, United Kingdom and other industrialized nations, commenced factory farming of beef and dairy cattle and domestic pigs.<ref name=\"Danielle Nierenburg 2005\"/>  From its American and West European heartland, intensive animal farming became globalized in the later years of the 20th century and is still expanding and replacing traditional practices of stock rearing in an increasing number of countries.<ref name=\"Danielle Nierenburg 2005\">Danielle Nierenburg (2005) ''Happier Meals: Rethinking the Global Meat Industry''.

The aim is to produce large quantities of meat, eggs, or milk at the lowest possible cost. Food is supplied in place. Methods employed to maintain health and improve production may include the use of disinfectants, antimicrobial agents, anthelmintics, hormones and vaccines; protein, mineral and vitamin supplements; frequent health inspections; [[biosecurity]]; and climate-controlled facilities. Physical restraints, e.g. fences or creeps, are used to control movement or actions regarded as undesirable. Breeding programs are used to produce animals more suited to the confined conditions and able to provide a consistent food product.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Eating Animals |date=2010 |publisher=Hachette Book Group USA |authorlink= Jonathan Safran Foer |last=Foer |first=Jonathan Safran |isbn=978-0316127165 |oclc=669754727}}</ref>\n\nIntensive production of livestock and poultry is widespread in [[developed nation]]s. For 2002\u20132003, [[FAO]] estimates of industrial production as a percentage of global production were 7 percent for beef and veal, 0.8 percent for sheep and goat meat, 42 percent for pork, and 67 percent for poultry meat. Industrial production was estimated to account for 39 percent of the sum of global production of these meats and 50 percent of total egg production.<ref>FAO.  2007.

Before this, chickens did not thrive during the winter (due to lack of sunlight), and egg production, incubation, and meat production in the off-season were all very difficult, making poultry a seasonal and expensive proposition. Year-round production lowered costs, especially for broilers.\n\nAt the same time, egg production was increased by scientific breeding. After a few false starts, (such as the Maine Experiment Station's failure at improving egg production) success was shown by Professor Dryden at the Oregon Experiment Station.<ref>Dryden, James. ''Poultry Breeding and Management''. Orange Judd Press, 1916.</ref>\n\nImprovements in production and quality were accompanied by lower labor requirements. In the 1930s through the early 1950s, 1,500 hens provided a full-time job for a farm family in America. In the late 1950s, egg prices had fallen so dramatically that farmers typically tripled the number of hens they kept, putting three hens into what had been a single-bird cage or converting their floor-confinement houses from a single deck of roosts to triple-decker roosts. Not long after this, prices fell still further and large numbers of egg farmers left the business. This fall in profitability was accompanied by a general fall in prices to the consumer, allowing poultry and eggs to lose their status as luxury foods.\n\nRobert Plamondon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plamondon.com|title=Plamondon.com: the home of Robert Plamondon and all his works!|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref> reports that the last family chicken farm in his part of Oregon, Rex Farms, had 30,000 layers and survived into the 1990s. However, the standard laying house of the current operators is around 125,000 hens.\n\nThe [[vertical integration]] of the egg and poultry industries was a late development, occurring after all the major technological changes had been in place for years (including the development of modern broiler rearing techniques, the adoption of the [[Cornish cross|Cornish Cross]] broiler, the use of laying cages, etc.).\n\nBy the late 1950s, poultry production had changed dramatically. Large farms and packing plants could grow birds by the tens of thousands. Chickens could be sent to [[slaughterhouse]]s for butchering and processing into prepackaged commercial products to be frozen or shipped fresh to markets or wholesalers. Meat-type chickens currently grow to market weight in six to seven weeks, whereas only fifty years ago it took three times as long.<ref>Havenstein, G.B., P.R. Ferket, and M.A. Qureshi, 2003a. \"Growth, livability, and feed conversion of 1957 versus 2001 broilers when fed representative 1957 and 2001 broiler diets\". Poult.

Once a meat consumed only occasionally, the common availability and lower cost has made chicken a common meat product within developed nations. Growing concerns over the [[cholesterol]] content of [[red meat]] in the 1980s and 1990s further resulted in increased consumption of chicken.\n\nToday, eggs are produced on large egg ranches on which environmental parameters are well controlled. Chickens are exposed to artificial light cycles to stimulate egg production year-round. In addition, [[forced molting]] is commonly practiced in the US, in which manipulation of light and food access triggers molting, in order to increase egg size and production. Forced molting is controversial, and is prohibited in the EU.<ref name=\"Wigley\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2013/s/salmonella.pdf |publisher=Compassion in World Farming |title=Salmonella |author=Wigley, P. |year=2013 |access-date=March 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216160101/https://www.ciwf.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2013/s/salmonella.pdf |archive-date=February 16, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn average, a chicken lays one egg a day, but not on every day of the year. This varies with the breed and time of year. In 1900, average egg production was 83 eggs per hen per year. In 2000, it was well over 300. In the United States, laying hens are butchered after their second egg laying season. In Europe, they are generally butchered after a single season. The laying period begins when the hen is about 18\u201320 weeks old (depending on breed and season). Males of the egg-type breeds have little commercial value at any age, and all those not used for breeding (roughly fifty percent of all egg-type chickens) are [[Chick culling|killed]] soon after hatching. The old hens also have little commercial value. Thus, the main sources of poultry meat 100 years ago (spring chickens and stewing hens) have both been entirely supplanted by meat-type broiler chickens.\n\n===Pigs===\n{{Main|Intensive pig farming}}\n[[File:Hog confinement barn interior.jpg|thumb |Pigs confined to a barn in an intensive system, [[Midwestern United States]]]]\n\nIntensive piggeries (or hog lots) are a type of what in America is called a [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation]] (CAFO), specialized for the raising of [[domestic pig]]s up to slaughterweight. In this system, grower pigs are housed indoors in group-housing or straw-lined sheds, whilst pregnant sows are confined in sow stalls ([[gestation crate]]s) and give birth in [[farrowing crate]]s.\n\nThe use of sow stalls has resulted in lower production costs and concomitant [[animal welfare]] concerns. Many of the world's largest producers of pigs (such as [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]]) use sow stalls, but some nations (such as the [[United Kingdom|UK]]) and [[U.S. state]]s (such as [[Florida]] and [[Arizona]]) have banned them.\n\nIntensive piggeries are generally large warehouse-like buildings. Indoor pig systems allow the pig's condition to be monitored, ensuring minimum fatalities and increased productivity. Buildings are ventilated and their temperature regulated. Most domestic pig varieties are susceptible to heat stress, and all pigs lack sweat glands and cannot cool themselves. Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death. Maintaining a more specific temperature within the pig-tolerance range also maximizes growth and growth to feed ratio. In an intensive operation pigs will lack access to a wallow (mud), which is their natural cooling mechanism.  Intensive piggeries control temperature through ventilation or drip water systems (dropping water to cool the system).\n\nPigs are naturally omnivorous and are generally fed a combination of grains and protein sources (soybeans, or [[meat and bone meal]]). Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed-grain crops are grown. Alternatively, piggeries are reliant on the grains industry. Pig feed may be bought packaged or mixed on-site. The intensive piggery system, where pigs are confined in individual stalls, allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed. The individual feeding system also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed. This has more significance to intensive farming methods, as the close proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly. To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth, drug programs such as [[antibiotic]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[hormone]]s and other supplements are preemptively administered.\n\nIndoor systems, especially stalls and pens (i.e. \u2018dry,\u2019 not straw-lined systems) allow for the easy collection of waste. In an indoor intensive pig farm, manure can be managed through a lagoon system or other waste-management system. However, odor remains a problem which is difficult to manage.\n\nThe way animals are housed in intensive systems varies. Breeding sows spend the bulk of their time in sow stalls during pregnancy or farrowing crates, with their litters, until market.\n\nPiglets often receive range of treatments including castration, tail docking to reduce tail biting, teeth clipped (to reduce injuring their mother's nipples, gum disease and prevent later tusk growth) and their ears notched to assist identification. Treatments are usually made without pain killers. Weak [[runt]]s may be slain shortly after birth.\n\nPiglets also may be [[wean]]ed and removed from the sows at between two and five weeks old<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalhogfarmer.com/mag/farming_revisiting_weaning_age |title=Revisiting Weaning Age Trends, Dynamics |date=October 15, 2005}}</ref> and placed in sheds. However, grower pigs \u2013 which comprise the bulk of the herd \u2013 are usually housed in alternative indoor housing, such as batch pens.  During pregnancy, the use of a stall may be preferred as it facilitates feed-management and growth control. It also prevents pig aggression (e.g. tail biting, ear biting, vulva biting, food stealing). Group pens generally require higher stockmanship skills.  Such pens will usually not contain straw or other material. Alternatively, a straw-lined shed may house a larger group (i.e. not batched) in age groups.\n\n===Cattle===\n[[File:Feedlot-1.jpg|left|thumb|Beef [[cattle]] on a [[feedlot]] in the [[Texas Panhandle]].

The feed also contains premixes composed of microingredients such as vitamins, minerals, chemical preservatives, [[Antibiotic use in livestock|antibiotics]], fermentation products, and other essential ingredients that are purchased from premix companies, usually in sacked form, for blending into commercial rations. Because of the availability of these products, a farmer using their own grain can formulate their own rations and be assured the animals are getting the recommended levels of minerals and vitamins.\n\nThere are many potential impacts on human health due to the modern cattle industrial agriculture system. There are concerns surrounding the antibiotics and growth hormones used, increased ''E. coli'' contamination, higher saturated fat contents in the meat because of the feed, and also environmental concerns.<ref>Pollan, Michael. 2002.

Beef calves are generally raised in small herds, with over 90% of the herds having less than 100 head of cattle. Fewer producers participate in the finishing phase which often occurs in a [[feedlot]], but nonetheless there are 82,170 feedlots in the United States.<ref>National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Agricultural Statistics Board, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 2010; [http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/USCatSup/USCatSup-12-17-2010.pdf Overview of the United States Cattle Industry]</ref>\n\n===Aquaculture===\n{{main|Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture}}\n[[File:IMTA cultured mussels (Mytilus edulis) in the Bay of Fundy Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Mytilus edulis|Blue mussels]] cultivated in proximity to [[Salmo salar|Atlantic salmon]] in the [[Bay of Fundy]], Canada]]\n\nIntegrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), also called integrated aquaculture,<ref name=\"Neori et al. 2004\"/> is a practice in which the by-products (wastes) from one species are recycled to become inputs ([[fertilizer]]s, food) for another, making [[aquaculture]] intensive. Fed aquaculture (e.g. fish and [[shrimp]]) is combined with inorganic extractive (e.g. [[seaweed]]) and organic extractive (e.g. [[shellfish]]) aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability (biomitigation), economic stability (product diversification and risk reduction) and social acceptability (better management practices).<ref name=\"Chopin et al. 2001\">Chopin T, Buschmann AH, Halling C, Troell M, Kautsky N, Neori A, Kraemer GP, Zertuche-Gonzalez JA, Yarish C and Neefus C. 2001.

In the United States, a [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation]] (CAFO) that discharges or proposes to discharge waste requires a permit and implementation of a plan for management of manure nutrients, contaminants, wastewater, etc., as applicable, to meet requirements pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act.<ref name=CAFOCDCP>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061021104950/https://www.cdc.gov/cafos/about.htm \"Concentrated animal feeding operations\"], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Health and Human Services.</ref><ref>US Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 122.42(e)</ref>  Some data on regulatory compliance and enforcement are available. In 2000, the US Environmental Protection Agency published 5-year and 1-year data on environmental performance of 32 industries, with data for the livestock industry being derived mostly from inspections of CAFOs.  The data pertain to inspections and enforcement mostly under the Clean Water Act, but also under the Clean Air Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Of the 32 industries, livestock production was among the top seven for environmental performance over the 5-year period, and was one of the top two in the final year of that period, where good environmental performance is indicated by a low ratio of enforcement orders to inspections. The five-year and final-year ratios of enforcement/inspections for the livestock industry were 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.  Also in the final year, the livestock industry was one of the two leaders among the 32 industries in terms of having the lowest  percentage of facilities with violations.<ref>US EPA. 2000. Profile of the agricultural livestock production industry. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Office of Compliance. EPA/310-R-00-002. 156 pp.</ref> In Canada, intensive livestock operations are subject to provincial regulation, with definitions of regulated entities varying among provinces. Examples include Intensive Livestock Operations (Saskatchewan), Confined Feeding Operations (Alberta), Feedlots (British Columbia), High-density Permanent Outdoor Confinement Areas (Ontario) and Feedlots or Parcs d'Engraissement (Manitoba). In Canada, intensive animal production, like other agricultural sectors, is also subject to various other federal and provincial requirements.\n\nIn the United States, farmed animals are excluded by half of all state [[animal cruelty]] laws including the federal [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]]. The 28-hour law, enacted in 1873 and amended in 1994 states that when animals are being transported for slaughter, the vehicle must stop every 28 hours and the animals must be let out for exercise, food, and water. The United States Department of Agriculture claims that the law does not apply to birds. The [[Humane Slaughter Act]] is similarly limited. Originally passed in 1958, the Act requires that livestock be stunned into unconsciousness prior to slaughter. This Act also excludes birds, who make up more than 90 percent of the animals slaughtered for food, as well as [[rabbit]]s and fish. Individual states all have their own animal cruelty statutes; however many states have a provision to exempt standard agricultural practices.<ref>[http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=1027] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928151011/http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=1027 |date=September 28, 2011 }} ALDF Farmed Animals and the Law</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusfd7usca1901.htm |title=US \u2013 Food Animal \u2013 Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter |publisher= Animal Legal & Historical Center |website=www.animallaw.info}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States there is an attempt to regulate farms in the most realistic way possible. The easiest way to effectively regulate the most animals with a limited number of resources and time is to regulate the large farms. In New York State many Animal Feeding Operations are not considered CAFOs since they either have less than 300 cows. These farms are not regulated to the level that CAFOs are. This can lead to pollution and nutrient leaching.
