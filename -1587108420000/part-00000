Delors presided over the [[European Commission]] for three terms (though the last one lasted for around a year). The first term lasted from 1985 to 1988, the second until 1992 and the final one until 1994, making Delors the longest serving president, and his Commission is also seen as the most successful at advancing European integration. It was the only Commission to serve three times, and Delors served five two-year terms (as they were then).<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/opinion/21iht-edgi_0.html A Bit More Delors Could Revamp the Commission] iht.com 21/01/92</ref> The third Commission was the first Commission of the [[European Union]], the [[Maastricht Treaty]] having come into force in 1993.\n\n==History==\nThe European Commissions led by Jacques Delors are regarded by some as the most successful in the [[European Union]]'s history at advancing integration. Delors himself became an icon of Euro-federalists and widely disliked by Eurosceptics, especially in Britain.<ref name=\"Eppink 07\"/>\n\n===Entrance===\n[[File:Delors Commission I.jpg|thumb|The first Delors Commission]]\nDelors entered office when [[eurosclerosis]] was at its height. The slow pace of enlargement, lack of democracy and economic problems caused that negative and apathetic attitudes to the Community were high. The preceding [[Thorn Commission]] was unable to exercise its authority to any meaningful extent in the face of the British vetoes on EU projects to force a more favourable agreement for it on the [[Budget of the European Union|Community budget]]. Delors had previously been one of the architects of the agreement at [[Fontainebleau]], which secured the [[UK rebate]], and Delors intended that the settling of the budget issue should herald a new era of [[European integration]].<ref name=\"Eppink 07\">{{cite book | last = Eppink | first = Derk-Jan | authorlink = Derk Jan Eppink | others = Ian Connerty (trans.) | title = Life of a European Mandarin: Inside the Commission | publisher = Lannoo | edition = 1st | pages = [https://archive.org/details/lifeofeuropeanma00eppi/page/20 20\u20137, 31] | location = Tielt, Belgium | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-90-209-7022-7 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofeuropeanma00eppi/page/20 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing Delors' arrival in [[Brussels]], he visited the various member states and found the same complaint that Europe reacted too slowly to issues, but did find common agreement on the [[single market]], with its business and cultural meaning, and hence Delors placed it as his main priority with a date for its achievement: 1992 (''Objectif 1992''). Despite his modern reputation he was criticised by federalists for not going far enough, even earning criticism from [[Altiero Spinelli]] in the [[European Parliament]], but Delors defended his goals as pragmatic stating \"we are all slaves to the circumstances\" {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. To accomplish his goal of completing the single market, Delors had to master the political system of the community: with any member able to block a proposal in the [[Council of the European Union|Council]], Delors convinced leaders to introduce [[Qualified Majority Voting]] so the procedure could not grind to a halt as it did under the budget disagreement. Thus, Delors set [[Francis Cockfield, Baron Cockfield|Lord Cockfield]], his [[European Commissioner for Internal Market & Services|Internal Market Commissioner]], in drafting the legislation. Now, Cockfield's work is seen as highly precise and his knowledge of the system legendary.<ref name=\"Eppink 07\"/>\n\n===Achievements===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078267-0023, Bonn, Ministerpr\u00e4sidenten mit EU-Kommissar Delors-CROPPED.jpg|thumb|President Delors in 1988]]\nThe Delors Commission gave a new momentum to the process of [[European integration]]. They 'completed' the internal market and laid the foundations for the single European currency. European [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] was based on the three stage plan drawn up by a committee headed by Delors (the Delors Report). Delors and his Commissioners are considered the \"[[Founding fathers of the European Union|founding fathers]]\" of the euro. The groundwork and political persuasion was achieved through the work of the Commissioners leading to the signature of the [[Single European Act]] (SEA) in February 1986 and the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] in 1992.<ref name=\"Discover\">{{cite web|title=Discover the former Presidents: The Delors Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/delors/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Delors Commission was also responsible for the creation of the [[Committee of the Regions]], having enshrined the idea of cohesion between EU states and regions in the SEA in 1986 leading Delors to propose the body in 1992.

Delors presided over the [[European Commission]] for three terms (though the last one lasted for around a year). The first term lasted from 1985 to 1988, the second until 1992 and the final one until 1994, making Delors the longest serving president, and his Commission is also seen as the most successful at advancing European integration. It was the only Commission to serve three times, and Delors served five two-year terms (as they were then).<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/opinion/21iht-edgi_0.html A Bit More Delors Could Revamp the Commission] iht.com 21/01/92</ref> The third Commission was the first Commission of the [[European Union]], the [[Maastricht Treaty]] having come into force in 1993.\n\n==History==\nThe European Commissions led by Jacques Delors are regarded by some as the most successful in the [[European Union]]'s history at advancing integration. Delors himself became an icon of Euro-federalists and widely disliked by Eurosceptics, especially in Britain.<ref name=\"Eppink 07\"/>\n\n===Entrance===\n[[File:Delors Commission I.jpg|thumb|The first Delors Commission]]\nDelors entered office when [[eurosclerosis]] was at its height. The slow pace of enlargement, lack of democracy and economic problems caused that negative and apathetic attitudes to the Community were high. The preceding [[Thorn Commission]] was unable to exercise its authority to any meaningful extent in the face of the British vetoes on EU projects to force a more favourable agreement for it on the [[Budget of the European Union|Community budget]]. Delors had previously been one of the architects of the agreement at [[Fontainebleau]], which secured the [[UK rebate]], and Delors intended that the settling of the budget issue should herald a new era of [[European integration]].<ref name=\"Eppink 07\">{{cite book | last = Eppink | first = Derk-Jan | authorlink = Derk Jan Eppink | others = Ian Connerty (trans.) | title = Life of a European Mandarin: Inside the Commission | publisher = Lannoo | edition = 1st | pages = [https://archive.org/details/lifeofeuropeanma00eppi/page/20 20\u20137, 31] | location = Tielt, Belgium | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-90-209-7022-7 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofeuropeanma00eppi/page/20 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing Delors' arrival in [[Brussels]], he visited the various member states and found the same complaint that Europe reacted too slowly to issues, but did find common agreement on the [[single market]], with its business and cultural meaning, and hence Delors placed it as his main priority with a date for its achievement: 1992 (''Objectif 1992''). Despite his modern reputation he was criticised by federalists for not going far enough, even earning criticism from [[Altiero Spinelli]] in the [[European Parliament]], but Delors defended his goals as pragmatic stating \"we are all slaves to the circumstances\" {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. To accomplish his goal of completing the single market, Delors had to master the political system of the community: with any member able to block a proposal in the [[Council of the European Union|Council]], Delors convinced leaders to introduce [[Qualified Majority Voting]] so the procedure could not grind to a halt as it did under the budget disagreement. Thus, Delors set [[Francis Cockfield, Baron Cockfield|Lord Cockfield]], his [[European Commissioner for Internal Market & Services|Internal Market Commissioner]], in drafting the legislation. Now, Cockfield's work is seen as highly precise and his knowledge of the system legendary.<ref name=\"Eppink 07\"/>\n\n===Achievements===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078267-0023, Bonn, Ministerpr\u00e4sidenten mit EU-Kommissar Delors-CROPPED.jpg|thumb|President Delors in 1988]]\nThe Delors Commission gave a new momentum to the process of [[European integration]]. They 'completed' the internal market and laid the foundations for the single European currency. European [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] was based on the three stage plan drawn up by a committee headed by Delors (the Delors Report). Delors and his Commissioners are considered the \"[[Founding fathers of the European Union|founding fathers]]\" of the euro. The groundwork and political persuasion was achieved through the work of the Commissioners leading to the signature of the [[Single European Act]] (SEA) in February 1986 and the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] in 1992.<ref name=\"Discover\">{{cite web|title=Discover the former Presidents: The Delors Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/delors/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Delors Commission was also responsible for the creation of the [[Committee of the Regions]], having enshrined the idea of cohesion between EU states and regions in the SEA in 1986 leading Delors to propose the body in 1992. It was created in 1994 and the building the body occupies was named after Delors in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Chris |title=Row over naming of 'Delors' EU building |publisher=TheParliament.com |date=18 September 2006 |url=http://www.theparliament.com/EN/News/200609/c7bd95bc-f034-4cf3-90b2-a0b6bb76a5f4.htm |accessdate=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127083905/http://www.theparliament.com/EN/News/200609/c7bd95bc-f034-4cf3-90b2-a0b6bb76a5f4.htm |archivedate=27 November 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> Delors' Commission oversaw a large degree of [[Enlargement of the European Union|expansion]].

The Delors Commission also prepared the opening to the eastern countries who later joined in 2004.<ref name=\"Discover\"/>\n\nIn 1988 Delors addressed the British [[Trade Union Congress]]; his speech about a ''social Europe'' was pivotal in turning [[Labour party (UK)|British Labour]] pro-European and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservatives]] against it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Nyta|title=How Europe splits the Tories|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=7 June 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2001/uk_and_europe/1979_1990.stm|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref> In 1992, as Delors' second term was coming to an end, the International Herald Tribune noted the effect of the Delors Commission, and the need for a third term;<ref name=\"IHT\">{{cite web|last=Merritt |first=Giles |title=A Bit More Delors Could Revamp the Commission |publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=21 January 1992 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/01/21/edgi_0.php |accessdate=2007-08-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124100011/http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/01/21/edgi_0.php |archivedate=24 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|\nMr. Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums. He arrived when Europessimism was at its worst. Although he was a little-known former French finance minister, he breathed life and hope into the EC and into the dispirited Brussels Commission.

He synthesized three themes. From the left came favouring the redistribution of wealth, and the protection of the weakest. Second a neo-mercantilist approach wanted to maximize European industrial output.  A third was reliance on the marketplace. His emphasis on the social nature of Europe is been central to a important exceptionalism narrative that became central to the self identification of the European Union. <ref>Alessandra Bitumi, \"\u2018An uplifting tale of Europe\u2019.

''Skyscrapers: Structure and Design.'' Laurence King Publishing, 2005 (p. 154)</ref> Additionally, a very large core size is required in very tall buildings to support the structure as well as to house the [[Skyscraper design and construction#The elevator conundrum|large number of elevators needed]]. The core size consumes a significant amount of the space on the lower and middle floors.<ref name=\"independent2008\" /> One of the ways Jeddah Tower attempts to overcome these issues is with its smooth, sloped-exterior design, which, although more expensive to build, offers superior aerodynamic performance over \"stepped\" designs such as the Burj Khalifa, allowing it to have a more conservative core overall. This was determined by wind tunnel tests performed at Burj Khalifa. Jeddah Tower will also use copious stiffening materials to prevent the excessive sway that would otherwise make the occupants of upper floors nauseated on windy days,<ref name=\"constructionweekaugust13tallorder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-13533-tall-order/|title=Tall order|author=Ephgrave, Oliver|date=13 August 2011|publisher=ConstructionWeekOnline|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> including very high strength concrete that will be up to several metres thick in certain parts of the core. This, along with the highly integrated steel frame and [[shear wall]]s, is also intended to prevent catastrophic failure of the structure in the event of a terrorist attack.<ref name=\"awesomevideointerviewaugust4\" /> Traditionally, the space consumed by elevators was considered to make a building become increasingly less profitable past 80 floors or so. More recently, it has been the advent of truly mixed-use design such as [[Shanghai Tower]] and Burj Khalifa, as well as improved building technology, that have outdated this rule of thumb, which generally applied to single use buildings.<ref name=\"nymagaugust14\">{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/arts/architecture/reviews/supertall-davidson-review-2011-8/|title=Higher: At the Skyscraper Museum, a reminder of why we keep reaching for the clouds|author=Davidson, Justin|date=14 August 2011|publisher=[[NY Mag]]|accessdate=14 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nLike Burj Khalifa, Jeddah employs a similar Y-shaped, triangular footprint which promotes stability<ref name=\"awesomevideointerviewaugust4\" /> and increases window views,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/kamin/ct-ae-lake-point-tower-anniversary-0923-story.html |title=50 years later, Lake Point Tower is a singular achievement \u2014 and let's hope it stays that way |last=Kamin |first=Blair |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2018-09-23 |language=en-US}}</ref> as well as a tapering form,<ref name=\"constructionweektapering\">{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-13521-experts-tapered-form-of-kingdom-tower-is-ideal/|title=Experts: tapered form of Kingdom Tower is ideal|author=Oliver Ephgrave|date=10 August 2011|publisher=ConstructionWeekOnline|accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref> with the sheer height and wind being the biggest structural design challenge.<ref name=\"constructionweekaugust7\" /> The smooth, sloped fa\u00e7ade of Kingdom Tower particularly induces a beneficial phenomenon known as \"wind vortex shedding.\"<ref name=\"constructionweekaugust13hypertall\" /> Normally when wind swirls around the [[leeward]] side of a building, rushing in from both sides to fill the low pressure zone, it would create tornado like vortices, which would rock the building from side to side due to variations in pressure, direction and velocity. The dynamic fa\u00e7ade of Kingdom Tower, however, creates an infinite timing differential (whereas Burj Khalifa is limited by the number of steps) in air pressure exertion in any one particular direction, thus creating a more stable structure, as there is no broad area of outstanding pressure or depression at any given time.<ref name=\"awesomevideointerviewaugust4\" /> Put simply, a smooth taper is more aerodynamic than an irregular or jagged taper, while both are advantageous over rectangular geometries.

''Skyscrapers: Structure and Design.'' Laurence King Publishing, 2005 (p. 154)</ref> Additionally, a very large core size is required in very tall buildings to support the structure as well as to house the [[Skyscraper design and construction#The elevator conundrum|large number of elevators needed]]. The core size consumes a significant amount of the space on the lower and middle floors.<ref name=\"independent2008\" /> One of the ways Jeddah Tower attempts to overcome these issues is with its smooth, sloped-exterior design, which, although more expensive to build, offers superior aerodynamic performance over \"stepped\" designs such as the Burj Khalifa, allowing it to have a more conservative core overall. This was determined by wind tunnel tests performed at Burj Khalifa. Jeddah Tower will also use copious stiffening materials to prevent the excessive sway that would otherwise make the occupants of upper floors nauseated on windy days,<ref name=\"constructionweekaugust13tallorder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-13533-tall-order/|title=Tall order|author=Ephgrave, Oliver|date=13 August 2011|publisher=ConstructionWeekOnline|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> including very high strength concrete that will be up to several metres thick in certain parts of the core. This, along with the highly integrated steel frame and [[shear wall]]s, is also intended to prevent catastrophic failure of the structure in the event of a terrorist attack.<ref name=\"awesomevideointerviewaugust4\" /> Traditionally, the space consumed by elevators was considered to make a building become increasingly less profitable past 80 floors or so. More recently, it has been the advent of truly mixed-use design such as [[Shanghai Tower]] and Burj Khalifa, as well as improved building technology, that have outdated this rule of thumb, which generally applied to single use buildings.<ref name=\"nymagaugust14\">{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/arts/architecture/reviews/supertall-davidson-review-2011-8/|title=Higher: At the Skyscraper Museum, a reminder of why we keep reaching for the clouds|author=Davidson, Justin|date=14 August 2011|publisher=[[NY Mag]]|accessdate=14 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nLike Burj Khalifa, Jeddah employs a similar Y-shaped, triangular footprint which promotes stability<ref name=\"awesomevideointerviewaugust4\" /> and increases window views,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/kamin/ct-ae-lake-point-tower-anniversary-0923-story.html |title=50 years later, Lake Point Tower is a singular achievement \u2014 and let's hope it stays that way |last=Kamin |first=Blair |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2018-09-23 |language=en-US}}</ref> as well as a tapering form,<ref name=\"constructionweektapering\">{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-13521-experts-tapered-form-of-kingdom-tower-is-ideal/|title=Experts: tapered form of Kingdom Tower is ideal|author=Oliver Ephgrave|date=10 August 2011|publisher=ConstructionWeekOnline|accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref> with the sheer height and wind being the biggest structural design challenge.<ref name=\"constructionweekaugust7\" /> The smooth, sloped fa\u00e7ade of Kingdom Tower particularly induces a beneficial phenomenon known as \"wind vortex shedding.\"<ref name=\"constructionweekaugust13hypertall\" /> Normally when wind swirls around the [[leeward]] side of a building, rushing in from both sides to fill the low pressure zone, it would create tornado like vortices, which would rock the building from side to side due to variations in pressure, direction and velocity. The dynamic fa\u00e7ade of Kingdom Tower, however, creates an infinite timing differential (whereas Burj Khalifa is limited by the number of steps) in air pressure exertion in any one particular direction, thus creating a more stable structure, as there is no broad area of outstanding pressure or depression at any given time.<ref name=\"awesomevideointerviewaugust4\" /> Put simply, a smooth taper is more aerodynamic than an irregular or jagged taper, while both are advantageous over rectangular geometries.

Its population was 4,414,681 at the 2010 census and its urban area is home to 2,146,980 inhabitants, including three urban districts, currently in the agglomeration.\n\nHistorically, Yangzhou was one of the wealthiest cities in China, known at various periods for its great merchant families, poets, artists, and scholars. Its name (<small>lit.</small> \"Rising Prefecture\") refers to its former position as the capital of the ancient [[Yangzhou (ancient China)|Yangzhou]] prefecture in [[History of the administrative divisions of China before 1912|imperial China]].

After the defeat of [[Yue (state)|Yue]] by [[King Fuchai of Wu]], a garrison city was built {{Convert|12|m|abbr=on}} above the water level on the north bank of the Yangtze c.&nbsp;485&nbsp;BC.  This city in the shape of a three by three ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' square was named Hancheng.<ref>Schinz, 1996</ref>  The newly built Han canal formed a moat around the south and east sides of the city. The purpose of Hancheng was to protect [[Suzhou]] from naval invasion from [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. During the [[Han dynasty]], Guangling was the seat of [[Guangling Commandery]]. It constituted a part of the [[Xu Province]], rather than the [[Yang Province]] (Yangzhou), which was covered the entire southeastern part of China then. In 590, the city was made the capital of a newly established [[Yang Prefecture (Jiangsu)|Yang Prefecture]], and began to be referred to with its current name.\n\nUnder [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] (r. 604\u2013617), Yangzhou was the southern capital of China. It was called Jiangdu upon the completion of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] until the fall of the [[Sui dynasty]]. By the mid 610s, a combination of fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, together with natural disasters and provincial unrest, ensured many people Emperor Yang had lost the legitimacy of his monarchy. As revolts spread across China in 616, the Emperor abandoned the North and meanwhile withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.\n\n===Tang Dynasty===\nThe city has remained a leading economic and cultural center and major port of foreign trade and external exchange since the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907).

Although some versions of Polo's memoirs imply that he was the governor of Yangzhou, it is more likely that he was an official in the salt industry, if indeed he was employed there at all. Chinese texts offer no supporting evidence for his claim. The discovery of the 1342 tomb of [[Katarina Vilioni]], member of an Italian trading family in Yangzhou, does, however, suggest the existence of a thriving Italian community in the city in the 14th century.

As early as 1655, the Dutch envoy [[Johan Nieuhof]] described the city (''Jamcefu'', i.e. Yangzhou-Fu, in his transcription) commented on the city's salt trade as follows:<ref>[[Johan Nieuhof]],\n''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=turn&entity=DLDecArts.Nieuhof.p0108 An embassy from the East-India Company of the United Provinces, to the Grand Tartar Cham, emperor of China: delivered by their excellencies Peter de Goyer and Jacob de Keyzer, at his imperial city of Peking wherein the cities, towns, villages, ports, rivers, &c. in their passages from Canton to Peking are ingeniously described by John Nieuhoff; ...

The riot that resulted was an angry crowd estimated at eight to ten thousand who assaulted the premises of the British [[OMF International|China Inland Mission]] in Yangzhou by looting, burning and attacking the missionaries led by [[Hudson Taylor]]. No one was killed, however several of the missionaries were injured as they were forced to flee for their lives. As a result of the report of the riot, the British consul in [[Shanghai]], [[Walter Henry Medhurst (consul)|Sir Walter Henry Medhurst]] took seventy [[Royal Marines]] in a [[man-of-war]] and steamed up the Yangtze to Nanjing in a controversial show of force that eventually resulted in an official apology from [[Viceroy]] [[Zeng Guofan]] and financial restitution made to the injured missionaries.\n\nFrom the time of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1853) to the beginning of the Reform Era (1980) Yangzhou was in decline, due to war damage, neglect of the Grand Canal as railways replaced it in importance, and stagnation in the early decades of the PRC. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], it endured eight years of enemy occupation and was used by the Japanese as a site for internment camps. About 1200 civilians of Allied nationalities (mostly British and Australian) from Shanghai were transported here in 1943, and located in one of three camps (A, B, and C). Camps B and C were closed down in September, 1943, after the second American-Japanese prisoner exchange, and their inhabitants transferred back to Shanghai camps.  Camp C, located in the former American Mission in the north-west of the city, was maintained for the duration of the war.<ref>Leck, Greg, ''Captives of Empire: The Japanese Internment of Allied Civilians in China'' Shandy Press, 2006; Antonia Finnane, ''Far From Where?

The city's status as a leading economic centre in China was never to be restored. Not until the 1990s did it begin to regain some semblance of prosperity, benefitting from national economic growth and a number of targeted development projects. With the canal now partially restored, and excellent rail and road connections, Yangzhou is once again an important transportation and market center. It also has some industrial output, chiefly in cotton and textiles. In 2004, a railway linked Yangzhou for the first time with Nanjing.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Yangzhou five pavilion bridge.JPG|thumb|250px|The Five Pavilion Bridge over Shouxi Lake.]]\nYangzhou is located on a plain north of the Yangtze. The Grand Canal, also known as the  [[Beijing|Jing]]-[[Hangzhou|Hang]] Canal, crosses the prefecture-level from the north to the south; its modern route passes through the eastern outskirts of Yangzhou's main urban area, while its old route runs through the city center. Other major bodies of water within the prefecture-level city include the [[Baoshe River]], [[Datong River]], [[Beichengzi River]], [[Tongyang Canal]], [[Xintongyang Canal]], [[Baima Lake]], [[Baoying Lake]], [[Gaoyou Lake]] and [[Shaobo Lake]].\n\nLike much of the entire prefecture-level city, Yangzhou's main urban area (the \"city proper\") is criss-crossed by an intricate network of canals and small lakes. The historic city center  (the former waled city) is surrounded by canals on all sides: the Old Grand Canal forms its eastern and southern boundaries; the City Moat Canal runs along the former walled city's northern edge, connecting the Old Grand Canal with the [[Slender West Lake]]; the Erdaohe Canal runs along the old city's western edge, from the Slender West Lake to the [[Hehuachi Park|Lotus Flower Pond]] (Hehuachi), which in its turn is connected by the short Erdaogou canal with the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://yangzhou.yztm.net/tnewsshow.asp?id=450 \u53e4\u8fd0\u6cb3\u2014\u8377\u82b1\u6c60\u2014\u7626\u897f\u6e56\u6c34\u4e0a\u6e38\u89c8\u7ebf\u5168\u90e8\u8d2f\u901a] (The Old Grand Canal - Hehua Pond - Thin West Lake tourist waterway is fully open), 2010-09-20</ref> It is possible to sail a small water craft from the Thin West Lake, via the Erdaohe, the Hehua Pond, and the Erdaogou into the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://www.yzcn.net/broadcast/pic/2011/0329/124850.shtml \u7eff\u6768\u57ce\u90ed\u6c34\u4e0a\u6e384\u00b718\u4eae\u76f8],  2011-3-29; see the map in this article</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nYangzhou has a subtropical monsoon climate with humid changeable wind; longer winters for about 4 months, summers 3 months and shorter springs and autumns, 2 months respectively; frost-free period of 222 days and annual average sunshine of 2177 hours.\n\nThe mean annual temperature is {{convert|15.72|\u00b0C|1}} annually; the normal monthly mean 24-hour temperature ranges from {{convert|2.5|\u00b0C}} in January to {{convert|28.0|\u00b0C}} in July.\n\nThe annual average precipitation is {{convert|1043|mm|abbr=on}}, and about 45 percent of rainfall is concentrated in the summer.

The average water depth is 15\u201320 meters. In 1992, the State Council approved it to become a first-grade open state harbour, and General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] inscribed its name. Now, it has developed into a comprehensive [[inland harbor]], integrating passenger, freight, container transportation and harbour trade, and has become the main distribution center of northern Jiangsu province, eastern [[Anhui]] Province and southeast [[Shandong]] Province. There are several dozen categories of goods including iron and steel, timber, minerals, coal, grain, cotton, container, products of light industry and machinery. The passenger routes reach Nanjing, Wuhu, [[Jiujiang]], [[Huangshi]] and [[Wuhan]] in the west, and [[Nantong]] and [[Shanghai]] in the east. Some well-known luxury international liners also anchor here.

In recent years, local government have attached great importance to the development of the tourism, in conjunction with a greater effort dedicated to the improvement of the local road transport system. With a total investment of 680 million yuan, the Yangzhou section of the Ningyang Expressway was completed on December 18, 1998 and opened to traffic in June 1999. Stretching nearly {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}}, the section of the expressway starts from the Bazi Flyover as the entry/exit, via the Yanggua Highway, the Tonggang Highway, an ancient canal, the Yangwei Highway, the Beijing\u2013Hangzhou Grand Canal and the Yangling Highway, to Liqojiagou Entry/Exit of Yangjiang Highway. It then passes the Jiangdu Flyover to directly link up with the Huaijiang Expressway. In addition, the section of Huaijiang Expressway within the territory of Yangzhou began construction on March 22, 1997, which will be commonly used by the state planned Tongjiang\u2013Sanya and Beijing\u2013Shanghai trunk lines. The section of Huaijiang Expressway in Yangzhou totals {{convert|112.04|km|abbr=on}}in length, starting from Jinghe Town of Baoying in the north to the entry/exist of Zhuanqiaozhen Flyover of Jiangdu in the south.

There are several bus stations on the city's outskirts; most of the buses from [[Nanjing]] (Nanjing West Bus Station) and Zhenjiang (where the bus station is adjacent to the [[Zhenjiang Railway Station]]) arrive to Yangzhou South Bus Station, located a few kilometers southwest from downtown. Most of the intercity bus service stops in the early evening.\n\n===Transportation in the Urban Area===\nThe city is served by an extensive network of public bus routes.\n\nYangzhou's taxi industry began in 1982, and has developed rapidly since 1993. the city has over 40 taxi companies of various ownership structures, with a total of 1,571 vehicles. Parking lots were established at key stations and hotels, and eight taxi companies have opened round-the-clock telephone service. The construction department of the municipal government has strengthened the management of taxi services, providing education in the relevant laws, professional ethics and safety aspects.\n\nIn 2014, Yangzhou's government approved plans for the construction of a subway system, which will initially include two lines. Line 1 will run in the general east-west direction, from Yangzhou Railway Station in the west to the historic central city to the future high-speed railway station (east of the Grand Canal) to [[Jiangdu District]]. Line 2 will run in the general north-south direction.<ref>[http://www.yznews.com.cn/09zjyz/jr/2014-06/06/content_5228300.htm \u626c\u5dde\u5730 1\u30012\u53f7\u7ebf\u8d70\u5411\u521d\u5b9a], 2014-06-06</ref>\n\n===Tourist Transportation===\n\nTo develop tourism in Yangzhou, sightseeing buses have been introduced in the city run by the Tianma travel agency under the Yangzhou Tourist Bureau. There is a tour guide on each bus. The route, starting from Yangzhou station, has eight stops, and passes by such scenic spots of the Slender West Lake, Daming Temple, Imperial Dock, Siwang Pagoda, Wenchang Pagoda and Shita Temple. Yangzhou Public Transit also operates No.1, No.5 and No.2 special tourist lines. No.1 bus departs from the bus station and goes by the Slender West Lake, Shigong Temple, Geyuan Garden and Heyuan Garden; No.5 bus starts from the bus station and goes by the Crane Temple, Wenchang Pagoda, Slender West Lake, Five-Pavilion Bridge, and Pingshan Hall. A sight-seeing route on Slender West Lake has opened, connecting Imperial Dock, Yichun Garden, Hong Garden, Dahong Bridge, Xiaojinshan, Diaoyutai, Five-Pavilion Bridge, and the 24-bridge, finally reaching Daming Temple and Pingshan Hall.<ref>[http://www.tourochina.com/guide/Yangzhou/transportation-index.html]</ref>\n\n==Industries and Shipyards==\nYangzhhou is the site of Chengxi shipyard, large shipyard where bulk carriers and other types of large ships are built.<ref>{{cite web |title=CSSC Official website |url=http://www.cssc.net.cn/en/ |website=www.cssc.net.cn |publisher=CSSC |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shipyards in Jiangsu China |url=https://www.shipyards.gr/shipyards/search-by/state?value=Jiangsu |website=www.shipyards.gr |publisher=Shipyard directory |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> Owned partly by the state owned [[CSSC]] holdings, through Jiangsu Xinrong shipyard, Chengxi Yangzhou shipyard builds ships from 25,000 dwt to 170,000 dwt in size.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chengxi Xinrong shipyard |url=https://www.shipyards.gr/shipyards/ship-repair-shipyards/Shiprepairs-fareast-pacific-ocean/Shiprepairs-fareast-china-sea/chengxi-shipyard-xinrong-china |website=www.shipyards.gr |publisher=Shipyard directory |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jiangsu Chengxi shipyard |url=http://www.cccme.org.cn/shop/cccme2164/introduction.aspx |website=www.cccme.org.cn |publisher=Official website CCCME |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Chengxi shipyard Jiangsu |url=https://ecmarine.com/jiangyin.html |website=www.ecmarine.com |publisher=East coast marine alliance |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=China's white listed shipyards |url=https://www.tradewindsnews.com/incoming/article362564.ece5 |accessdate=6 December 2018 |publisher=Trade Winds}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Our expereince |url=http://tymvios.digital/projects/shipyard-experience/ |website=www.tymvios.digital |publisher=Shulte marine concepts |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nYangzhou dishes may be one of the reasons why the people of Yangzhou are so infatuated with their city. They have an appealing color, aroma, taste and appearance. The original color of each ingredient is preserved after cooking, and no oily sauce is added, so as to retain the fresh flavour of the food.\n\nIn Yangzhou all dishes, whether cheap or expensive, are elaborate. Cooks will not scrimp on their work, even with [[dazhu gansi]] ({{zh|c=\u5927\u716e\u5e72\u4e1d|p=d\u00e0zh\u01d4 g\u0101ns\u012b}}), a popular dish that costs only a few yuan. Dry bean curd is made by each restaurant that serves it, so the flavor is guaranteed. The cook slices the 1-cm-thick curd into 30 shreds, each one paper-thin but none broken, and then stews them for hours with chopped bamboo shoots and shelled shrimps in chicken soup. In this way the dry bean curd shreds can soak up the flavor of the other ingredients, and the soup is clear but savory. Not only Yangzhou cooks, but also the ordinary people are conscientious about cooking.\n\n* [[Fu Chun Teahouse]]\n* [[Yangzhou fried rice]], is said {{by whom|date=May 2014}} to have been invented by a person who was a former Yangzhou [[magistrate]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Yangzhou-childrens-library-scooter-parking-3411.jpg|thumb|Children's Library building, on the premises of Yangzhou Public Library]]\nThe Yangzhou dialect ({{zh|c=\u626c\u5dde\u8bdd|p=Y\u00e1ngzh\u014du hu\u00e0|links=no}}) of Chinese is representative of [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]], and is particularly close to the [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|official language]] of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] courts, which was based on the [[Nanjing dialect]]. However, it does differ considerably from modern [[Standard Chinese]], although they are still moderately [[mutually intelligible]].\n\nDialect has also been used as a tool for regional identity and politics in the [[Jiangbei region|Jiangbei]] and [[Jiangnan]] regions. While the city of Yangzhou was the center of trade, flourishing and prosperous, it was considered part of Jiangnan, which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangzi river. Once Yangzhou's wealth and prosperity were gone, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei, the \"backwater\". After Yangzhou was removed from Jiangnan, its residents decided{{dubious|date=January 2016}} to replace [[Jianghuai Mandarin]], which was the dialect of Yangzhou, with [[Taihu Wu dialects]]. In Jiangnan itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of prestige dialect.<ref>{{cite book\n | url=https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo\n | url-access=registration\n | title=Teachers of the inner chambers: women and culture in seventeenth-century China\n | volume=\n | year=1994\n | author=Dorothy Ko\n | publisher=Stanford University Press\n | edition=illustrated, annotated\n | location=\n | isbn=0-8047-2359-1\n | page=[https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo/page/21 21]\n | pages=\n | quote=With the exclusion of Yangzhou came the denigration of its dialect, a variant of Jianghuai \"Mandarin\" (guanhua).

The innovative painter-calligrapher [[Shitao]] lived in Yangzhou during the 1680s and again from 1697 until his death in 1707. A later group of painters from that time called the [[Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou]] are famous throughout China.\n\nFormer General secretary of CPC, President of China [[Jiang Zemin]] was born and raised in Yangzhou. His middle school is located right across from the public notary's office in Yangzhou.\n\nYangzhou is famous for its carved [[lacquerware]] and [[jade]].\n\nSome of China's most creative and eye catching dishes come from the Yangzhou school of cuisine called [[Huaiyang cuisine|Huaiyang]] (also commonly known as the Weiyang school). Along with [[Sichuan cuisine]], [[Cantonese cuisine]], and [[Shandong cuisine]], Huaiyang cuisine ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6dee\u626c\u83dc}}) is a distinctive and masterful skill that locals are quite proud of.\n\nThe city is famous for its [[public bath]] houses, [[lacquerware]], jadeware, embroidery, paper-cut, art & crafts velvet flavers.\n\nThe city was awarded [[Habitat Scroll of Honour]] in 2006.\n\nYangzhou is also very famous for its toy industry (especially stuffed animals). Many tourists from neighboring cities travel to the city for its good-quality and low-priced toys.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the city is also famous for an ancient folk art called Yangzhou storytelling ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u8bc4\u8bdd}}), which is like [[Xiangsheng]]\u2014the traditional Chinese comedic performance. It rose as a performing act during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. In the performance, the artist details an interesting historical story to audiences, using Yangzhou dialect. These stories have been edited by artists, so they sound very soul-stirring and funny. The best known artist of Yangzhou storytelling was [[Wang shaotang]]. His most famous works are The 10 chapters of [[Wu Song]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6b66\u5341\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Song Jiang]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b8b\u5341\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Lu Junyi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5362\u5341\u56de}}), and The 10 chapters of [[Shi Xiu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u77f3\u5341\u56de}}).<ref>Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl, The Oral Tradition of Yangzhou Storytelling, London: Routledge, 1996; Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl and Jette Ross, Chinese Storytellers: Life and Art in the Yangzhou Tradition, Cheng and Tsui 2002.</ref>\n[[File:Chinese snowball.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese snowball flowers]]\n\n===Literary references===\nYangzhou was frequently referenced in Chinese literature.  Poet [[Li Bai]] (c.700\u2013762) wrote in ''Seeing Meng Haoran off to Yangzhou from Yellow Crane Pavilion'':\n\n:At Yellow Crane Pavilion in the west\n:My old friend says farewell;\n:In the mist and flowers of spring\n:He goes down to Yangzhou;\n:Lonely sail, distant shadow,\n:Vanish in blue emptiness;\n:All I see is the great river\n:Flowing into the far horizon.\n\n[[Du Mu]] wrote the famous lines on Yangzhou:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8fWf7pYOIUC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=How to Read Chinese Poetry: A Guided Anthology|author= Zong-qi Cai |page= Columbia University Press|date=30 November 2007 |isbn=9780231511889 }}</ref>\n\n:After ten years, I awoke from my Yangzhou dream,\n:All I gained was a fickle reputation in the green mansions.\n\nThe \"green mansions\" or \"green/black lofts\" (''qinglou'') refers to the pleasure districts for which Yangzhou became known.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvFJQ6WE1agC&pg=PA287#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Lifestyle and Entertainment in Yangzhou|authors= Lucie B.

Yangzhou is famous for its many well preserved Yangzhou style gardens.  Most of the Historic city is in the Guangling District.\n\n===Slender West Lake===\n{{main|Slender West Lake}}\nNamed after Hangzhou's famous West Lake, this long, narrow stretch of water which meanders through Yangzhou's western limits is a well-known scenic spot. A long bank planted with weeping willows spans the lake; at its midpoint stands a square terrace with pavilions at each of the corners and one in the center. Around the lake is a park in which are found several attractions: Lotus Flower Pagoda (Lianhua SO), a white structure reminiscent of the White Pagoda (Baita) in Beijing's Beihai Park; Small Gold Mountain (Xiao Jin Shan); and the Fishing Platform (Diaoyutai), a favorite retreat of the Qing emperor Qian Long. The emperor was so gratified by his luck in fishing at this spot that he ordered additional stipends for the town. As it turns out, his success had been augmented by local swimmers who lurked in the lake busily attaching fish to his hook.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Serene and Fragrant Study.JPG|Study hall\nImage:Si Qiao Yan Yu Building.jpg|Four bridges in rain and mist\nImage:The Sunny Spring Stage.jpg|Imperial birthday celebration stage\nImage:Du Mu 24 bridge poem.JPG|Mao Zedong's calligraphy of Tang dynasty poet Du Mu poem\nImage:Twenty four bridge.JPG|24 ancient beauties played flute on this bridge\nImage:White pagoda clear sky and cloud garden.JPG|Entrance to a garden\nImage:Jinjingge copy.JPG|The jinjingge bridge\nImage:Xu Garden.jpg|The Xu Garden\n</gallery>\n\n===Daming Temple===\n{{main|Daming Temple}}\nLocated on Shugang Hill, in the city's northwest, is Fajing Temple, formerly known as DaMing Temple. The original temple was built in Liu Song Dynasty  (420\u2013479). A nine-story pagoda, the Qilingta, was built on the temple grounds in the year of Sui Dynasty (589\u2013618) . A recent addition to the temple complex is the [[Jianzhen]] Memorial Hall, built according to Tang Dynasty methods and financed with contributions raised by Buddhist groups in Japan.\nWhen Qing Emperor Qian Long visited Yangzhou in 1765, he was troubled by The temple's name DaMing (which literally means \"Great Ming') fearing that it might revive nostalgia for the Ming Dynasty, which was overthrown by his Manchu predecessors. He had it renamed Fajing Temple.\nThe temple was seriously damaged during the Taiping Rebellion at the beginning of the 20th century. The present structure is a reconstruction dating from the 1930s.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Daming temple.JPG|Da Ming Temple\nImage:Jianzhen memorial hall.jpg|Memorial Hall of monk Jianzhen\nImage:QilingP.jpg|Da Ming temple pagoda\n</gallery>\n\n===Flat Hills (Ping Shan) Hall===\nBuilt by the Song Dynasty writer Ouyang Xiu when he served as prefect of the city, this hall stands just west of Fajing Temple. Looking out from this hall, the mountains to the south of the Yangtze River appear as a line at the viewer's eye level, hence the name Flat Hills Hall. When Ouyang Xiu's student Su Dongpo moved to Yangzhou, he too served as prefect of the city. He had a hall built directly behind the one erected by his master, and called it Guling Hall.\n\n===Pavilion of Flourishing Culture ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u6587\u660c\u9601}}}}, W\u00e9nch\u0101ng G\u00e9)===\n[[File:Yangzhou-WenchangGe-traffic-3417.jpg|thumb|Wenchang Ge]]\nThis round, three-story pavilion in Yangzhou's eastern sector was built in 1585 and celebrates the city's rich cultural traditions. It is also the de facto center of the city.\n\nBuilt during [[Ming dynasty]], it is located on the cross of Wenchang Road and Wenhe Road. The whole building is about 79 foot high, and looks like [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing. Today, bordered by many shopping stores, Wenchange had been a symbol of commercial center to residents.\n\n===Stone Pagoda ===\nStanding west of the Pavilion of Flourishing Culture is a five-story Tang Dynasty pagoda ({{zh|s=\u77f3\u5854|hp=Sh\u00edt\u01ce|links=no}}). Built in 837, it is the oldest pagoda still standing in Yangzhou.\n\n===Tomb of Puhaddin===\n[[File:Yangzhou-Minaret-3284.jpg|thumb|left|The mosque complex at the tomb of Puhaddin]]\nThis is essentially a Ming Dynasty graveyard that includes the tomb of [[Puhaddin]]. According to information at the tomb, he was a 16th generation descendant of [[Muhammad]], The Prophet. The tomb is on the eastern bank of the (Old) Grand Canal in the eastern sector of the city and is adjacent to a mosque which houses a collection of valuable materials documenting China's relations with Muslim countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/china/beijing-to-shanghai/review-434792.html|title=Garden Tomb of Puhaddin Beijing to Shanghai Review|website=www.fodors.com}}</ref>\n\n===Ge Garden ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u4e2a\u5712}}}}, G\u00e8 Yu\u00e1n)===\nThe entrance to this typical southern style garden with its luxuriant bamboo groves, ponds, and rock grottoes is on Dongguan St. in the city's northeast section. Designed by the great Qing Dynasty landscape painter Shi Tao for Wang Yingtai, an officer of the Qing imperial court, this garden takes its name from the shape of bamboo leaves which resemble the Chinese character ge, meaning \"a\" or \"an.\"\n\n===He Garden ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u4f55\u56ed}}}}, H\u00e9 Yu\u00e1n)===\nThis garden, also called Jixiao Shan Zhuang, was built by He Zhidao, a 19th-century Qing government official, this garden home is famous for a {{convert|430|m|ft|abbr=on}}, two storied winding corridor, the walls of which are lined with stone tablets carved with lines of classical poetry, In the garden is also an open-air theater set on an island in the middle of a fish pond.\n\n===Yechun Garden (Yechun Yuan)===\nIn this garden, which lies on the banks of the Xiading River at the city's northern limits, the Qing Dynasty poet Wang Yuyang and a circle of friends used to gather to recite their works. The thatched roofs of the pavilions in this garden give it a quaint, rustic air.\n\n===[[Yangzhou Museum]] & Yangzhou Block Printing Museum ===\n[[File:Yangzhou-Double-Museum-2869.jpg|thumb|Yangzhou Museum / China Block Printing Museum]]\nSituated on the west side of the Bright Moon Lake, the Yangzhou Chinese Block Printing Museum ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u4e2d\u56fd\u96d5\u7248\u5370\u5237\u535a\u7269\u9986}}) and Yangzhou Museum ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u535a\u7269\u9986}}) look into the distance of Yangzhou International Exhibition Centre and covers an area of 50,000 square meters, with a construction space of 25,000 square meters, and an exhibition area of 10,000 square metres. Its unique architectural form embodies the harmony of man nature, structure and natural environment. In August, 2003, over 300,000 ancient books blockings were collected from Guangling Press of Yangzhou and China Block Printing Museum was established under the approval of the State Council, over 300,000 ancient book blockings collected by Guangling Press of Yangzhou were included in the new museum.\n\n===Jiangdu Hydro Project===\nConstruction of this multiple-purpose water control project, the biggest in China, started in 1961 and was completed in 1975. The project includes facilities for irrigation, drainage, navigation, and power generation. It consists of four large modern electric pumping stations, six medium-sized check gates, thrice navigation locks, and two trunk waterways.\n\n==Education==\n*[[Yangzhou University]]\n*[[Sima Primary School]]\n*[[Yangzhou Polytechnic College]]\n*[[Yangzhou Polytechnic Institute]]\n\n==Sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in China}}\n* {{flagdeco|Russia}} [[Balashikha]], Moscow Oblast, Russia\n* {{flagdeco|USA}} [[Kent, Washington]], US<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kentwa.gov/SisterCity-YangzhouChina.html |title=Yangzhou, China |website=City of Kent, Washington}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Malaysia}} [[Malacca City]], Malaysia\n* {{flagdeco|Germany}} [[Neubrandenburg]], Germany<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neubrandenburg.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=192:partnerste&catid=34:partnerste&Itemid=184 |title=Yangzhou, China - sister city|website=Neubrandenburg, Germany website}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Germany}} [[Offenbach am Main]], Germany (since 1997)<ref>{{cite web|title=Offenbach und seine Partnerst\u00e4dte|url=http://www.offenbach.de/rathaus/stadtinfo/staedtepartnerschaften/staedtepartnerschaften-intro.php|publisher=City of Offenbach|accessdate=25 September 2016|date=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|France}} [[Orl\u00e9ans]], France\n* {{flagdeco|New Zealand}} [[Porirua]], New Zealand<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sistercities.org.nz/index.php?s=cities | title=About Sister Cities | website=Sister Cities New Zealand}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Canada}} [[Vaughan]], Ontario, Canada\n* {{flagdeco|USA}} [[Westport, Connecticut]], US<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westportct.gov/index.aspx?page=190 |title=Sister Cities Committee |website=Westport, Connecticut}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Iranians in China]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | first = Alvyn | last = Austin | authorlink = Alvyn Austin | year = 2007 | title = China\u2019s Millions: The China Inland Mission and Late Qing Society | publisher = Eerdmans | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan | isbn =978-0-8028-2975-7}}\n*{{cite book | first = Antonia | last = Finnane | authorlink = Antonia Finnane| year = 2004 | title = Speaking of Yangzhou: A Chinese City, 1550 - 1850| publisher = Harvard Asia Center | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn =0674013921}}\n* {{cite book | first = Jonathan | last = Hay | authorlink = Jonathan Hay (author)| year = 2001 | title = Shitao: Painting and Modernity in Early Qing China| publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York| isbn =0-521-39342-6}}\n*{{cite book | first = Ping-ti| last = Ho | authorlink = Ping-to Ho| year = 1954 | title = \"The Salt Merchants of Yang-chou: A Study of Commercial Capital in Eighteenth-Century China,\"Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 17: 130-168}}\n*{{cite book | first = Ginger Cheng-chi | last = Hs\u00fc | authorlink = Ginger Cheng-chi Hs\u00fc | year = 2001 | title = A Bushel of Pearls: Painting for Sale in Eighteenth-Century Yangchow| publisher = Stanford University Press| location = Stanford, California| isbn =0-8047-3252-3}}\n*{{cite book | first = Tobie | last = Meyer-Fong | authorlink = Tobie Meyer-Fong| year = 2003 | title = Building Culture in Early Qing Yangzhou| publisher = Stanford University Press| location = Stanford, California | isbn =0-8047-4485-8}}\n*{{cite book | first = Lucie, and Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl| last = Olivov\u00e1 | year = 2009 | title = Lifestyle and entertainment in Yangzhou| publisher = NIAS Press| location = Copenhagen| isbn =978-87-7694-035-5}}\n* \"Yangzhou.\" ''Encyclopedia of China''. ed.

Sitting on the north bank of the [[Yangtze]], it borders the provincial capital [[Nanjing]] to the southwest, [[Huai'an]] to the north, [[Yancheng]] to the northeast, [[Taizhou, Jiangsu|Taizhou]] to the east, and [[Zhenjiang]] across the river to the south. Its population was 4,414,681 at the 2010 census and its urban area is home to 2,146,980 inhabitants, including three urban districts, currently in the agglomeration.\n\nHistorically, Yangzhou was one of the wealthiest cities in China, known at various periods for its great merchant families, poets, artists, and scholars. Its name (<small>lit.</small> \"Rising Prefecture\") refers to its former position as the capital of the ancient [[Yangzhou (ancient China)|Yangzhou]] prefecture in [[History of the administrative divisions of China before 1912|imperial China]].

After the defeat of [[Yue (state)|Yue]] by [[King Fuchai of Wu]], a garrison city was built {{Convert|12|m|abbr=on}} above the water level on the north bank of the Yangtze c.&nbsp;485&nbsp;BC.  This city in the shape of a three by three ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' square was named Hancheng.<ref>Schinz, 1996</ref>  The newly built Han canal formed a moat around the south and east sides of the city. The purpose of Hancheng was to protect [[Suzhou]] from naval invasion from [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. During the [[Han dynasty]], Guangling was the seat of [[Guangling Commandery]]. It constituted a part of the [[Xu Province]], rather than the [[Yang Province]] (Yangzhou), which was covered the entire southeastern part of China then. In 590, the city was made the capital of a newly established [[Yang Prefecture (Jiangsu)|Yang Prefecture]], and began to be referred to with its current name.\n\nUnder [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] (r. 604\u2013617), Yangzhou was the southern capital of China. It was called Jiangdu upon the completion of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] until the fall of the [[Sui dynasty]]. By the mid 610s, a combination of fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, together with natural disasters and provincial unrest, ensured many people Emperor Yang had lost the legitimacy of his monarchy. As revolts spread across China in 616, the Emperor abandoned the North and meanwhile withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.\n\n===Tang Dynasty===\nThe city has remained a leading economic and cultural center and major port of foreign trade and external exchange since the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907). Many Arab and Persian merchants lived in the city in the 7th century, but they were massacred in the thousands in 760 during the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] by Tian Shengong's ({{zh|s=\u7530\u795e\u529f|hp=Ti\u00e1n Sh\u00e9ng\u014dng|w=T'ien Shen-kung|links=no}}) rebel insurgents during the [[Yangzhou massacre (760)]].<ref name=\"Perkins\">{{Cite book|last=Perkins|first=Dorothy|title=Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture|publisher=Roundtable Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8160-4374-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|accessdate=2012-01-10|quote=Probably by the 7th century Persians had joined with Arabs to create the foreign emporium on the Grand Canal at Yangchou mentioned by the New T'ang History.

Although some versions of Polo's memoirs imply that he was the governor of Yangzhou, it is more likely that he was an official in the salt industry, if indeed he was employed there at all. Chinese texts offer no supporting evidence for his claim. The discovery of the 1342 tomb of [[Katarina Vilioni]], member of an Italian trading family in Yangzhou, does, however, suggest the existence of a thriving Italian community in the city in the 14th century. Moreover, both in [[The Travels of Marco Polo]] and in the [[History of Yuan]] there is documentation about a [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christian]], who funded two churches in China during the three years he served as an official of the emperor: this functionary is named \"Mar Sarchis\" by Marco Polo and \"Ma Xuelijisi\" in the History of Yuan.

As early as 1655, the Dutch envoy [[Johan Nieuhof]] described the city (''Jamcefu'', i.e. Yangzhou-Fu, in his transcription) commented on the city's salt trade as follows:<ref>[[Johan Nieuhof]],\n''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=turn&entity=DLDecArts.Nieuhof.p0108 An embassy from the East-India Company of the United Provinces, to the Grand Tartar Cham, emperor of China: delivered by their excellencies Peter de Goyer and Jacob de Keyzer, at his imperial city of Peking wherein the cities, towns, villages, ports, rivers, &c. in their passages from Canton to Peking are ingeniously described by John Nieuhoff; ...

The riot that resulted was an angry crowd estimated at eight to ten thousand who assaulted the premises of the British [[OMF International|China Inland Mission]] in Yangzhou by looting, burning and attacking the missionaries led by [[Hudson Taylor]]. No one was killed, however several of the missionaries were injured as they were forced to flee for their lives. As a result of the report of the riot, the British consul in [[Shanghai]], [[Walter Henry Medhurst (consul)|Sir Walter Henry Medhurst]] took seventy [[Royal Marines]] in a [[man-of-war]] and steamed up the Yangtze to Nanjing in a controversial show of force that eventually resulted in an official apology from [[Viceroy]] [[Zeng Guofan]] and financial restitution made to the injured missionaries.\n\nFrom the time of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1853) to the beginning of the Reform Era (1980) Yangzhou was in decline, due to war damage, neglect of the Grand Canal as railways replaced it in importance, and stagnation in the early decades of the PRC. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], it endured eight years of enemy occupation and was used by the Japanese as a site for internment camps. About 1200 civilians of Allied nationalities (mostly British and Australian) from Shanghai were transported here in 1943, and located in one of three camps (A, B, and C). Camps B and C were closed down in September, 1943, after the second American-Japanese prisoner exchange, and their inhabitants transferred back to Shanghai camps.  Camp C, located in the former American Mission in the north-west of the city, was maintained for the duration of the war.<ref>Leck, Greg, ''Captives of Empire: The Japanese Internment of Allied Civilians in China'' Shandy Press, 2006; Antonia Finnane, ''Far From Where?

The city's status as a leading economic centre in China was never to be restored. Not until the 1990s did it begin to regain some semblance of prosperity, benefitting from national economic growth and a number of targeted development projects. With the canal now partially restored, and excellent rail and road connections, Yangzhou is once again an important transportation and market center. It also has some industrial output, chiefly in cotton and textiles. In 2004, a railway linked Yangzhou for the first time with Nanjing.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Yangzhou five pavilion bridge.JPG|thumb|250px|The Five Pavilion Bridge over Shouxi Lake.]]\nYangzhou is located on a plain north of the Yangtze. The Grand Canal, also known as the  [[Beijing|Jing]]-[[Hangzhou|Hang]] Canal, crosses the prefecture-level from the north to the south; its modern route passes through the eastern outskirts of Yangzhou's main urban area, while its old route runs through the city center. Other major bodies of water within the prefecture-level city include the [[Baoshe River]], [[Datong River]], [[Beichengzi River]], [[Tongyang Canal]], [[Xintongyang Canal]], [[Baima Lake]], [[Baoying Lake]], [[Gaoyou Lake]] and [[Shaobo Lake]].\n\nLike much of the entire prefecture-level city, Yangzhou's main urban area (the \"city proper\") is criss-crossed by an intricate network of canals and small lakes. The historic city center  (the former waled city) is surrounded by canals on all sides: the Old Grand Canal forms its eastern and southern boundaries; the City Moat Canal runs along the former walled city's northern edge, connecting the Old Grand Canal with the [[Slender West Lake]]; the Erdaohe Canal runs along the old city's western edge, from the Slender West Lake to the [[Hehuachi Park|Lotus Flower Pond]] (Hehuachi), which in its turn is connected by the short Erdaogou canal with the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://yangzhou.yztm.net/tnewsshow.asp?id=450 \u53e4\u8fd0\u6cb3\u2014\u8377\u82b1\u6c60\u2014\u7626\u897f\u6e56\u6c34\u4e0a\u6e38\u89c8\u7ebf\u5168\u90e8\u8d2f\u901a] (The Old Grand Canal - Hehua Pond - Thin West Lake tourist waterway is fully open), 2010-09-20</ref> It is possible to sail a small water craft from the Thin West Lake, via the Erdaohe, the Hehua Pond, and the Erdaogou into the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://www.yzcn.net/broadcast/pic/2011/0329/124850.shtml \u7eff\u6768\u57ce\u90ed\u6c34\u4e0a\u6e384\u00b718\u4eae\u76f8],  2011-3-29; see the map in this article</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nYangzhou has a subtropical monsoon climate with humid changeable wind; longer winters for about 4 months, summers 3 months and shorter springs and autumns, 2 months respectively; frost-free period of 222 days and annual average sunshine of 2177 hours.\n\nThe mean annual temperature is {{convert|15.72|\u00b0C|1}} annually; the normal monthly mean 24-hour temperature ranges from {{convert|2.5|\u00b0C}} in January to {{convert|28.0|\u00b0C}} in July.\n\nThe annual average precipitation is {{convert|1043|mm|abbr=on}}, and about 45 percent of rainfall is concentrated in the summer.

There are over 10 airline ticket offices in Yangzhou, providing convenient service for foreign and domestic tourists. domestic and international fight are available with 10 international airlines and more than 20 domestic ones\n\n===Rail===\nUntil 2004, Yangzhou was not served by passenger rail. [[Yangzhou Railway Station]] began construction in 2003 and was completed a year later. It is located on the western outskirts of the city, and is a major station on the [[Nanjing\u2013Qidong Railway]], and provides direct passenger service to the provincial capital as well as a number of major cities to the west, north, and south (such as [[Xi'an]], [[Wuhan]], and [[Guangzhou]]), including an overnight [[Z-series trains|Z-series express train]] to [[Beijing]].<ref>[http://www.tielu.org/ tielu.org], schedule search for Yangzhou</ref> Later, frequent high-speed (D-series) service has been introduced on this line as well.\n\nThere is no direct rail service between Yangzhou and [[Shanghai]], however; to travel to Shanghai, or elsewhere in the [[Yangtze Delta]] regions, travelers cross the Yangtze over the new [[Runyang Bridge]] to Zhenjiang (frequent commuter bus service is available) and take a train from the [[Zhenjiang Railway Station]], which is located on the main Nanjing-Shanghai rail line.\n\nIn 2016, construction work started on a new north-south rail line, the Lianyungan-Huai'an-Yangzhou-Zhenjiang Railway.

The average water depth is 15\u201320 meters. In 1992, the State Council approved it to become a first-grade open state harbour, and General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] inscribed its name. Now, it has developed into a comprehensive [[inland harbor]], integrating passenger, freight, container transportation and harbour trade, and has become the main distribution center of northern Jiangsu province, eastern [[Anhui]] Province and southeast [[Shandong]] Province. There are several dozen categories of goods including iron and steel, timber, minerals, coal, grain, cotton, container, products of light industry and machinery. The passenger routes reach Nanjing, Wuhu, [[Jiujiang]], [[Huangshi]] and [[Wuhan]] in the west, and [[Nantong]] and [[Shanghai]] in the east. Some well-known luxury international liners also anchor here. The harbour has greatly promoted the development of exports and the overall local economy.\n\n===Expressways===\n\nThe Ningyang (Nanjing\u2013Yangzhou) Expressway crosses the southern part of Yangzhou's metropolitan area while the Ningtong (Nanjing\u2013Nantong) Expressway is connected to Yangzhou at Liaojiagou. In recent years, local government have attached great importance to the development of the tourism, in conjunction with a greater effort dedicated to the improvement of the local road transport system. With a total investment of 680 million yuan, the Yangzhou section of the Ningyang Expressway was completed on December 18, 1998 and opened to traffic in June 1999. Stretching nearly {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}}, the section of the expressway starts from the Bazi Flyover as the entry/exit, via the Yanggua Highway, the Tonggang Highway, an ancient canal, the Yangwei Highway, the Beijing\u2013Hangzhou Grand Canal and the Yangling Highway, to Liqojiagou Entry/Exit of Yangjiang Highway. It then passes the Jiangdu Flyover to directly link up with the Huaijiang Expressway. In addition, the section of Huaijiang Expressway within the territory of Yangzhou began construction on March 22, 1997, which will be commonly used by the state planned Tongjiang\u2013Sanya and Beijing\u2013Shanghai trunk lines. The section of Huaijiang Expressway in Yangzhou totals {{convert|112.04|km|abbr=on}}in length, starting from Jinghe Town of Baoying in the north to the entry/exist of Zhuanqiaozhen Flyover of Jiangdu in the south. It then links with Ningtong Expressway, passing by three counties (cities) such as Baoying, Gaoyou and Jiangdu and 26 towns, at a total cost of 3.7 billion yuan. It is expected to be open to traffic by the year 2000.\n[[File:Yangzhou-Modern-Grand-Canal-barge-caravan-3342.JPG|thumb|The modern route of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] passes within a few kilometers east of the city's main urban area]]\n\n===Intercity bus service===\nDuring the daytime, frequent bus service operates between Yangzhou and nearby cities. There are several bus stations on the city's outskirts; most of the buses from [[Nanjing]] (Nanjing West Bus Station) and Zhenjiang (where the bus station is adjacent to the [[Zhenjiang Railway Station]]) arrive to Yangzhou South Bus Station, located a few kilometers southwest from downtown. Most of the intercity bus service stops in the early evening.\n\n===Transportation in the Urban Area===\nThe city is served by an extensive network of public bus routes.\n\nYangzhou's taxi industry began in 1982, and has developed rapidly since 1993. the city has over 40 taxi companies of various ownership structures, with a total of 1,571 vehicles. Parking lots were established at key stations and hotels, and eight taxi companies have opened round-the-clock telephone service. The construction department of the municipal government has strengthened the management of taxi services, providing education in the relevant laws, professional ethics and safety aspects.\n\nIn 2014, Yangzhou's government approved plans for the construction of a subway system, which will initially include two lines. Line 1 will run in the general east-west direction, from Yangzhou Railway Station in the west to the historic central city to the future high-speed railway station (east of the Grand Canal) to [[Jiangdu District]]. Line 2 will run in the general north-south direction.<ref>[http://www.yznews.com.cn/09zjyz/jr/2014-06/06/content_5228300.htm \u626c\u5dde\u5730 1\u30012\u53f7\u7ebf\u8d70\u5411\u521d\u5b9a], 2014-06-06</ref>\n\n===Tourist Transportation===\n\nTo develop tourism in Yangzhou, sightseeing buses have been introduced in the city run by the Tianma travel agency under the Yangzhou Tourist Bureau. There is a tour guide on each bus. The route, starting from Yangzhou station, has eight stops, and passes by such scenic spots of the Slender West Lake, Daming Temple, Imperial Dock, Siwang Pagoda, Wenchang Pagoda and Shita Temple. Yangzhou Public Transit also operates No.1, No.5 and No.2 special tourist lines. No.1 bus departs from the bus station and goes by the Slender West Lake, Shigong Temple, Geyuan Garden and Heyuan Garden; No.5 bus starts from the bus station and goes by the Crane Temple, Wenchang Pagoda, Slender West Lake, Five-Pavilion Bridge, and Pingshan Hall. A sight-seeing route on Slender West Lake has opened, connecting Imperial Dock, Yichun Garden, Hong Garden, Dahong Bridge, Xiaojinshan, Diaoyutai, Five-Pavilion Bridge, and the 24-bridge, finally reaching Daming Temple and Pingshan Hall.<ref>[http://www.tourochina.com/guide/Yangzhou/transportation-index.html]</ref>\n\n==Industries and Shipyards==\nYangzhhou is the site of Chengxi shipyard, large shipyard where bulk carriers and other types of large ships are built.<ref>{{cite web |title=CSSC Official website |url=http://www.cssc.net.cn/en/ |website=www.cssc.net.cn |publisher=CSSC |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shipyards in Jiangsu China |url=https://www.shipyards.gr/shipyards/search-by/state?value=Jiangsu |website=www.shipyards.gr |publisher=Shipyard directory |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> Owned partly by the state owned [[CSSC]] holdings, through Jiangsu Xinrong shipyard, Chengxi Yangzhou shipyard builds ships from 25,000 dwt to 170,000 dwt in size.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chengxi Xinrong shipyard |url=https://www.shipyards.gr/shipyards/ship-repair-shipyards/Shiprepairs-fareast-pacific-ocean/Shiprepairs-fareast-china-sea/chengxi-shipyard-xinrong-china |website=www.shipyards.gr |publisher=Shipyard directory |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jiangsu Chengxi shipyard |url=http://www.cccme.org.cn/shop/cccme2164/introduction.aspx |website=www.cccme.org.cn |publisher=Official website CCCME |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Chengxi shipyard Jiangsu |url=https://ecmarine.com/jiangyin.html |website=www.ecmarine.com |publisher=East coast marine alliance |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=China's white listed shipyards |url=https://www.tradewindsnews.com/incoming/article362564.ece5 |accessdate=6 December 2018 |publisher=Trade Winds}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Our expereince |url=http://tymvios.digital/projects/shipyard-experience/ |website=www.tymvios.digital |publisher=Shulte marine concepts |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nYangzhou dishes may be one of the reasons why the people of Yangzhou are so infatuated with their city.

Cooks will not scrimp on their work, even with [[dazhu gansi]] ({{zh|c=\u5927\u716e\u5e72\u4e1d|p=d\u00e0zh\u01d4 g\u0101ns\u012b}}), a popular dish that costs only a few yuan. Dry bean curd is made by each restaurant that serves it, so the flavor is guaranteed. The cook slices the 1-cm-thick curd into 30 shreds, each one paper-thin but none broken, and then stews them for hours with chopped bamboo shoots and shelled shrimps in chicken soup. In this way the dry bean curd shreds can soak up the flavor of the other ingredients, and the soup is clear but savory. Not only Yangzhou cooks, but also the ordinary people are conscientious about cooking.\n\n* [[Fu Chun Teahouse]]\n* [[Yangzhou fried rice]], is said {{by whom|date=May 2014}} to have been invented by a person who was a former Yangzhou [[magistrate]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Yangzhou-childrens-library-scooter-parking-3411.jpg|thumb|Children's Library building, on the premises of Yangzhou Public Library]]\nThe Yangzhou dialect ({{zh|c=\u626c\u5dde\u8bdd|p=Y\u00e1ngzh\u014du hu\u00e0|links=no}}) of Chinese is representative of [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]], and is particularly close to the [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|official language]] of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] courts, which was based on the [[Nanjing dialect]]. However, it does differ considerably from modern [[Standard Chinese]], although they are still moderately [[mutually intelligible]].\n\nDialect has also been used as a tool for regional identity and politics in the [[Jiangbei region|Jiangbei]] and [[Jiangnan]] regions. While the city of Yangzhou was the center of trade, flourishing and prosperous, it was considered part of Jiangnan, which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangzi river. Once Yangzhou's wealth and prosperity were gone, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei, the \"backwater\". After Yangzhou was removed from Jiangnan, its residents decided{{dubious|date=January 2016}} to replace [[Jianghuai Mandarin]], which was the dialect of Yangzhou, with [[Taihu Wu dialects]]. In Jiangnan itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of prestige dialect.<ref>{{cite book\n | url=https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo\n | url-access=registration\n | title=Teachers of the inner chambers: women and culture in seventeenth-century China\n | volume=\n | year=1994\n | author=Dorothy Ko\n | publisher=Stanford University Press\n | edition=illustrated, annotated\n | location=\n | isbn=0-8047-2359-1\n | page=[https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo/page/21 21]\n | pages=\n | quote=With the exclusion of Yangzhou came the denigration of its dialect, a variant of Jianghuai \"Mandarin\" (guanhua).

The innovative painter-calligrapher [[Shitao]] lived in Yangzhou during the 1680s and again from 1697 until his death in 1707. A later group of painters from that time called the [[Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou]] are famous throughout China.\n\nFormer General secretary of CPC, President of China [[Jiang Zemin]] was born and raised in Yangzhou. His middle school is located right across from the public notary's office in Yangzhou.\n\nYangzhou is famous for its carved [[lacquerware]] and [[jade]].\n\nSome of China's most creative and eye catching dishes come from the Yangzhou school of cuisine called [[Huaiyang cuisine|Huaiyang]] (also commonly known as the Weiyang school). Along with [[Sichuan cuisine]], [[Cantonese cuisine]], and [[Shandong cuisine]], Huaiyang cuisine ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6dee\u626c\u83dc}}) is a distinctive and masterful skill that locals are quite proud of.\n\nThe city is famous for its [[public bath]] houses, [[lacquerware]], jadeware, embroidery, paper-cut, art & crafts velvet flavers.\n\nThe city was awarded [[Habitat Scroll of Honour]] in 2006.\n\nYangzhou is also very famous for its toy industry (especially stuffed animals). Many tourists from neighboring cities travel to the city for its good-quality and low-priced toys.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the city is also famous for an ancient folk art called Yangzhou storytelling ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u8bc4\u8bdd}}), which is like [[Xiangsheng]]\u2014the traditional Chinese comedic performance. It rose as a performing act during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. In the performance, the artist details an interesting historical story to audiences, using Yangzhou dialect. These stories have been edited by artists, so they sound very soul-stirring and funny. The best known artist of Yangzhou storytelling was [[Wang shaotang]]. His most famous works are The 10 chapters of [[Wu Song]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6b66\u5341\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Song Jiang]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b8b\u5341\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Lu Junyi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5362\u5341\u56de}}), and The 10 chapters of [[Shi Xiu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u77f3\u5341\u56de}}).<ref>Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl, The Oral Tradition of Yangzhou Storytelling, London: Routledge, 1996; Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl and Jette Ross, Chinese Storytellers: Life and Art in the Yangzhou Tradition, Cheng and Tsui 2002.</ref>\n[[File:Chinese snowball.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese snowball flowers]]\n\n===Literary references===\nYangzhou was frequently referenced in Chinese literature.  Poet [[Li Bai]] (c.700\u2013762) wrote in ''Seeing Meng Haoran off to Yangzhou from Yellow Crane Pavilion'':\n\n:At Yellow Crane Pavilion in the west\n:My old friend says farewell;\n:In the mist and flowers of spring\n:He goes down to Yangzhou;\n:Lonely sail, distant shadow,\n:Vanish in blue emptiness;\n:All I see is the great river\n:Flowing into the far horizon.\n\n[[Du Mu]] wrote the famous lines on Yangzhou:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8fWf7pYOIUC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=How to Read Chinese Poetry: A Guided Anthology|author= Zong-qi Cai |page= Columbia University Press|date=30 November 2007 |isbn=9780231511889 }}</ref>\n\n:After ten years, I awoke from my Yangzhou dream,\n:All I gained was a fickle reputation in the green mansions.\n\nThe \"green mansions\" or \"green/black lofts\" (''qinglou'') refers to the pleasure districts for which Yangzhou became known.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvFJQ6WE1agC&pg=PA287#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Lifestyle and Entertainment in Yangzhou|authors= Lucie B.

Yangzhou is famous for its many well preserved Yangzhou style gardens.  Most of the Historic city is in the Guangling District.\n\n===Slender West Lake===\n{{main|Slender West Lake}}\nNamed after Hangzhou's famous West Lake, this long, narrow stretch of water which meanders through Yangzhou's western limits is a well-known scenic spot. A long bank planted with weeping willows spans the lake; at its midpoint stands a square terrace with pavilions at each of the corners and one in the center. Around the lake is a park in which are found several attractions: Lotus Flower Pagoda (Lianhua SO), a white structure reminiscent of the White Pagoda (Baita) in Beijing's Beihai Park; Small Gold Mountain (Xiao Jin Shan); and the Fishing Platform (Diaoyutai), a favorite retreat of the Qing emperor Qian Long. The emperor was so gratified by his luck in fishing at this spot that he ordered additional stipends for the town. As it turns out, his success had been augmented by local swimmers who lurked in the lake busily attaching fish to his hook.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Serene and Fragrant Study.JPG|Study hall\nImage:Si Qiao Yan Yu Building.jpg|Four bridges in rain and mist\nImage:The Sunny Spring Stage.jpg|Imperial birthday celebration stage\nImage:Du Mu 24 bridge poem.JPG|Mao Zedong's calligraphy of Tang dynasty poet Du Mu poem\nImage:Twenty four bridge.JPG|24 ancient beauties played flute on this bridge\nImage:White pagoda clear sky and cloud garden.JPG|Entrance to a garden\nImage:Jinjingge copy.JPG|The jinjingge bridge\nImage:Xu Garden.jpg|The Xu Garden\n</gallery>\n\n===Daming Temple===\n{{main|Daming Temple}}\nLocated on Shugang Hill, in the city's northwest, is Fajing Temple, formerly known as DaMing Temple. The original temple was built in Liu Song Dynasty  (420\u2013479). A nine-story pagoda, the Qilingta, was built on the temple grounds in the year of Sui Dynasty (589\u2013618) . A recent addition to the temple complex is the [[Jianzhen]] Memorial Hall, built according to Tang Dynasty methods and financed with contributions raised by Buddhist groups in Japan.\nWhen Qing Emperor Qian Long visited Yangzhou in 1765, he was troubled by The temple's name DaMing (which literally means \"Great Ming') fearing that it might revive nostalgia for the Ming Dynasty, which was overthrown by his Manchu predecessors. He had it renamed Fajing Temple.\nThe temple was seriously damaged during the Taiping Rebellion at the beginning of the 20th century. The present structure is a reconstruction dating from the 1930s.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Daming temple.JPG|Da Ming Temple\nImage:Jianzhen memorial hall.jpg|Memorial Hall of monk Jianzhen\nImage:QilingP.jpg|Da Ming temple pagoda\n</gallery>\n\n===Flat Hills (Ping Shan) Hall===\nBuilt by the Song Dynasty writer Ouyang Xiu when he served as prefect of the city, this hall stands just west of Fajing Temple. Looking out from this hall, the mountains to the south of the Yangtze River appear as a line at the viewer's eye level, hence the name Flat Hills Hall. When Ouyang Xiu's student Su Dongpo moved to Yangzhou, he too served as prefect of the city. He had a hall built directly behind the one erected by his master, and called it Guling Hall.\n\n===Pavilion of Flourishing Culture ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u6587\u660c\u9601}}}}, W\u00e9nch\u0101ng G\u00e9)===\n[[File:Yangzhou-WenchangGe-traffic-3417.jpg|thumb|Wenchang Ge]]\nThis round, three-story pavilion in Yangzhou's eastern sector was built in 1585 and celebrates the city's rich cultural traditions. It is also the de facto center of the city.\n\nBuilt during [[Ming dynasty]], it is located on the cross of Wenchang Road and Wenhe Road. The whole building is about 79 foot high, and looks like [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing. Today, bordered by many shopping stores, Wenchange had been a symbol of commercial center to residents.\n\n===Stone Pagoda ===\nStanding west of the Pavilion of Flourishing Culture is a five-story Tang Dynasty pagoda ({{zh|s=\u77f3\u5854|hp=Sh\u00edt\u01ce|links=no}}). Built in 837, it is the oldest pagoda still standing in Yangzhou.\n\n===Tomb of Puhaddin===\n[[File:Yangzhou-Minaret-3284.jpg|thumb|left|The mosque complex at the tomb of Puhaddin]]\nThis is essentially a Ming Dynasty graveyard that includes the tomb of [[Puhaddin]]. According to information at the tomb, he was a 16th generation descendant of [[Muhammad]], The Prophet. The tomb is on the eastern bank of the (Old) Grand Canal in the eastern sector of the city and is adjacent to a mosque which houses a collection of valuable materials documenting China's relations with Muslim countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/china/beijing-to-shanghai/review-434792.html|title=Garden Tomb of Puhaddin Beijing to Shanghai Review|website=www.fodors.com}}</ref>\n\n===Ge Garden ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u4e2a\u5712}}}}, G\u00e8 Yu\u00e1n)===\nThe entrance to this typical southern style garden with its luxuriant bamboo groves, ponds, and rock grottoes is on Dongguan St. in the city's northeast section. Designed by the great Qing Dynasty landscape painter Shi Tao for Wang Yingtai, an officer of the Qing imperial court, this garden takes its name from the shape of bamboo leaves which resemble the Chinese character ge, meaning \"a\" or \"an.\"\n\n===He Garden ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u4f55\u56ed}}}}, H\u00e9 Yu\u00e1n)===\nThis garden, also called Jixiao Shan Zhuang, was built by He Zhidao, a 19th-century Qing government official, this garden home is famous for a {{convert|430|m|ft|abbr=on}}, two storied winding corridor, the walls of which are lined with stone tablets carved with lines of classical poetry, In the garden is also an open-air theater set on an island in the middle of a fish pond.\n\n===Yechun Garden (Yechun Yuan)===\nIn this garden, which lies on the banks of the Xiading River at the city's northern limits, the Qing Dynasty poet Wang Yuyang and a circle of friends used to gather to recite their works. The thatched roofs of the pavilions in this garden give it a quaint, rustic air.\n\n===[[Yangzhou Museum]] & Yangzhou Block Printing Museum ===\n[[File:Yangzhou-Double-Museum-2869.jpg|thumb|Yangzhou Museum / China Block Printing Museum]]\nSituated on the west side of the Bright Moon Lake, the Yangzhou Chinese Block Printing Museum ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u4e2d\u56fd\u96d5\u7248\u5370\u5237\u535a\u7269\u9986}}) and Yangzhou Museum ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u535a\u7269\u9986}}) look into the distance of Yangzhou International Exhibition Centre and covers an area of 50,000 square meters, with a construction space of 25,000 square meters, and an exhibition area of 10,000 square metres. Its unique architectural form embodies the harmony of man nature, structure and natural environment. In August, 2003, over 300,000 ancient books blockings were collected from Guangling Press of Yangzhou and China Block Printing Museum was established under the approval of the State Council, over 300,000 ancient book blockings collected by Guangling Press of Yangzhou were included in the new museum.\n\n===Jiangdu Hydro Project===\nConstruction of this multiple-purpose water control project, the biggest in China, started in 1961 and was completed in 1975. The project includes facilities for irrigation, drainage, navigation, and power generation. It consists of four large modern electric pumping stations, six medium-sized check gates, thrice navigation locks, and two trunk waterways.\n\n==Education==\n*[[Yangzhou University]]\n*[[Sima Primary School]]\n*[[Yangzhou Polytechnic College]]\n*[[Yangzhou Polytechnic Institute]]\n\n==Sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in China}}\n* {{flagdeco|Russia}} [[Balashikha]], Moscow Oblast, Russia\n* {{flagdeco|USA}} [[Kent, Washington]], US<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kentwa.gov/SisterCity-YangzhouChina.html |title=Yangzhou, China |website=City of Kent, Washington}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Malaysia}} [[Malacca City]], Malaysia\n* {{flagdeco|Germany}} [[Neubrandenburg]], Germany<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neubrandenburg.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=192:partnerste&catid=34:partnerste&Itemid=184 |title=Yangzhou, China - sister city|website=Neubrandenburg, Germany website}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Germany}} [[Offenbach am Main]], Germany (since 1997)<ref>{{cite web|title=Offenbach und seine Partnerst\u00e4dte|url=http://www.offenbach.de/rathaus/stadtinfo/staedtepartnerschaften/staedtepartnerschaften-intro.php|publisher=City of Offenbach|accessdate=25 September 2016|date=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|France}} [[Orl\u00e9ans]], France\n* {{flagdeco|New Zealand}} [[Porirua]], New Zealand<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sistercities.org.nz/index.php?s=cities | title=About Sister Cities | website=Sister Cities New Zealand}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Canada}} [[Vaughan]], Ontario, Canada\n* {{flagdeco|USA}} [[Westport, Connecticut]], US<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westportct.gov/index.aspx?page=190 |title=Sister Cities Committee |website=Westport, Connecticut}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Iranians in China]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | first = Alvyn | last = Austin | authorlink = Alvyn Austin | year = 2007 | title = China\u2019s Millions: The China Inland Mission and Late Qing Society | publisher = Eerdmans | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan | isbn =978-0-8028-2975-7}}\n*{{cite book | first = Antonia | last = Finnane | authorlink = Antonia Finnane| year = 2004 | title = Speaking of Yangzhou: A Chinese City, 1550 - 1850| publisher = Harvard Asia Center | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn =0674013921}}\n* {{cite book | first = Jonathan | last = Hay | authorlink = Jonathan Hay (author)| year = 2001 | title = Shitao: Painting and Modernity in Early Qing China| publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York| isbn =0-521-39342-6}}\n*{{cite book | first = Ping-ti| last = Ho | authorlink = Ping-to Ho| year = 1954 | title = \"The Salt Merchants of Yang-chou: A Study of Commercial Capital in Eighteenth-Century China,\"Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 17: 130-168}}\n*{{cite book | first = Ginger Cheng-chi | last = Hs\u00fc | authorlink = Ginger Cheng-chi Hs\u00fc | year = 2001 | title = A Bushel of Pearls: Painting for Sale in Eighteenth-Century Yangchow| publisher = Stanford University Press| location = Stanford, California| isbn =0-8047-3252-3}}\n*{{cite book | first = Tobie | last = Meyer-Fong | authorlink = Tobie Meyer-Fong| year = 2003 | title = Building Culture in Early Qing Yangzhou| publisher = Stanford University Press| location = Stanford, California | isbn =0-8047-4485-8}}\n*{{cite book | first = Lucie, and Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl| last = Olivov\u00e1 | year = 2009 | title = Lifestyle and entertainment in Yangzhou| publisher = NIAS Press| location = Copenhagen| isbn =978-87-7694-035-5}}\n* \"Yangzhou.\" ''Encyclopedia of China''. ed.
