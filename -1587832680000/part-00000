He later represented another Queens residents group, the [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]]\u2013[[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] Committee on Urban Scale, who opposed [[Samuel J.

In a close and highly fractured election, U.S. Representative [[Ed Koch]] finished first with 19.81% of the vote and Cuomo came second with 18.74%. As no candidate cleared 40% of the vote, Koch and Cuomo advanced to a runoff. Koch emerged victorious with 54.94% of the vote to Cuomo's 45.06%.

He once again faced Ed Koch in the Democratic primary. This time, Koch's support for the death penalty backfired and he alienated many voters from outside New York City when, in an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, he described the lifestyle of both suburbia and upstate New York as \"sterile\" and lamented the thought of having to live in \"the small town\" of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] as governor, saying it was \"a city without a good Chinese restaurant\".<ref name=\"marioeffect\"/> Cuomo won the primary by ten points and faced Republican nominee businessman [[Lewis Lehrman]] in the general election.

[[Geraldine Ferraro]] was ultimately nominated as his running mate, but Cuomo was chosen to give the keynote speech at the [[1984 Democratic National Convention]] in [[San Francisco]]. He vigorously attacked [[Ronald Reagan]]'s record and policies in his [[A Tale of Two Cities (speech)|''Tale of Two Cities'' speech]] that brought him to national attention, most memorably saying: \"There is despair, Mr. President, in the faces that you don't see, in the places that you don't visit, in your shining city.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/speeches/speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention#speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention |title=Mario Cuomo Delivers Keynote Address to Democratic National Convention |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001201/http://www.history.com/speeches/speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention |archivedate=December 31, 2013|website=History Channel |publisher=A & E Television Networks |year=2013 |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>Cuomo, M.M.

In October 1991, news broke that he was interested in running and was taking advice from consultant [[Bob Shrum]]. At the same time, he began working on a budget with the [[New York State Legislature]], and promised not to make any announcements about a presidential run until he had reached an agreement with the Republican-controlled [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] and the Democratic-controlled [[New York State Assembly|State Assembly]]. Two polls taken in November of the [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 1992|New Hampshire Democratic primary]] showed him leading the field by at least twenty points, and a poll in December showed him trailing President [[George H.

He later represented another Queens residents group, the [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]]\u2013[[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] Committee on Urban Scale, who opposed [[Samuel J.

In a close and highly fractured election, U.S. Representative [[Ed Koch]] finished first with 19.81% of the vote and Cuomo came second with 18.74%. As no candidate cleared 40% of the vote, Koch and Cuomo advanced to a runoff. Koch emerged victorious with 54.94% of the vote to Cuomo's 45.06%.

He once again faced Ed Koch in the Democratic primary. This time, Koch's support for the death penalty backfired and he alienated many voters from outside New York City when, in an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, he described the lifestyle of both suburbia and upstate New York as \"sterile\" and lamented the thought of having to live in \"the small town\" of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] as governor, saying it was \"a city without a good Chinese restaurant\".<ref name=\"marioeffect\"/> Cuomo won the primary by ten points and faced Republican nominee businessman [[Lewis Lehrman]] in the general election.

[[Geraldine Ferraro]] was ultimately nominated as his running mate, but Cuomo was chosen to give the keynote speech at the [[1984 Democratic National Convention]] in [[San Francisco]]. He vigorously attacked [[Ronald Reagan]]'s record and policies in his [[A Tale of Two Cities (speech)|''Tale of Two Cities'' speech]] that brought him to national attention, most memorably saying: \"There is despair, Mr. President, in the faces that you don't see, in the places that you don't visit, in your shining city.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/speeches/speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention#speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention |title=Mario Cuomo Delivers Keynote Address to Democratic National Convention |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001201/http://www.history.com/speeches/speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention |archivedate=December 31, 2013|website=History Channel |publisher=A & E Television Networks |year=2013 |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>Cuomo, M.M.

O'Rourke]] by 64.3% to 31.77%. He consistently ruled out the possibility of running in the 1988 presidential election, announcing on February 19, 1987, that he would not run and then going on to publicly decline [[Draft (politics)|draft movements]] in the wake of [[Gary Hart]]'s withdrawal following the [[Gary Hart#1988 presidential campaign and the Donna Rice affair|Donna Rice affair]].<ref name=\"mystery\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/15/magazine/the-mystery-of-mario-cuomo.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=The mystery of Mario Cuomo |date=May 15, 1988 |access-date=March 7, 2013 |newspaper=New York Times |first=Jeffrey |last=Schmalz}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1990 New York gubernatorial election|1990 gubernatorial election]], Cuomo was re-elected with 53.17% of the vote to Republican [[Pierre Andrew Rinfret]]'s 21.35% and Conservative [[Herbert London]]'s 20.40%.\n\nWhen Cuomo was asked if he was planning to run for President in 1992, he would say: \"I have no plans and no plans to make plans\", but he refused to rule it out. In October 1991, news broke that he was interested in running and was taking advice from consultant [[Bob Shrum]]. At the same time, he began working on a budget with the [[New York State Legislature]], and promised not to make any announcements about a presidential run until he had reached an agreement with the Republican-controlled [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] and the Democratic-controlled [[New York State Assembly|State Assembly]]. Two polls taken in November of the [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 1992|New Hampshire Democratic primary]] showed him leading the field by at least twenty points, and a poll in December showed him trailing President [[George H. W.

As it was unusual for solo flute to be featured widely in orchestral concerts, this was not easily done in the immediate years after World War II; however, Rampal's flair and presence\u2014he was a big man to wield such a slim instrument\u2014paved the way for the next generation of flautist superstars such as [[James Galway]] and [[Emmanuel Pahud]].\n\nRampal was a player in the classical French flute tradition,  although behind his superior technical facility lay the cavalier 'Latin' temperament of the Mediterranean south, rather than the more formal character of the elite north Parisian institutions. His father was taught by Hennebains, who also taught Rene le Roy and [[Marcel Moyse]].<ref name=\"frenchflute\">{{cite book | title=The French Flute School, 1860\u20131950 | publisher=Tony Bingham | last=Dorgeuille | first=Claude | year=1986 | isbn=978-0-946113-02-6 | others=Trans. Edward Blakeman | page=26}}</ref><ref group=nb>Joseph Rampal studied flute at the Paris Conservatoire where [[Adolphe Hennebains]] (1862\u20131914) had in 1909 succeeded Paul Taffanel as professor of flute. Joseph Rampal went on to win the First Prize in the Conservatoire's annual flute competition in 1919.</ref> His playing style was characterised by a bright sound, a sonorous elegance of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] lit up by a rich palette of subtle tone colours. He exuded a dashing, lightly articulated virtuosity that thrilled audiences in his heyday, and his natural vibrato varied according to the emotion of the music he played. Additionally, Rampal was able to breathe in the middle of extended rapid passages without losing the sweep of his rendition. His upper register and wide dynamic range were particularly notable, as was the lightness and crispness of his staccato articulation (his \"d\u00e9tach\u00e9\") heard on his early recordings.{{#tag:ref|English flautist William Bennett cites this particular characteristic of Rampal's playing as a point of skill he wished to improve when he sought out Rampal in Paris for tuition;<ref name=\"bennett-dufrene\"/>{{self-published inline|date=November 2010}}\nBennett also speaks about this in the 1983 BBC Radio 4 profile \"Rampal\u2014Prince of Flute-Players\" where Rampal himself surmises that a native French-speaker's natural facility for producing the ''tu'' sound in speech was one reason why the articulation of many French flute-players was so good.|group=nb}}\n\nRampal is best known for popularising the flute in the post\u2013World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II years, recovering a vast number of flute compositions from the [[Baroque]] era, and spurring contemporary composers, such as [[Francis Poulenc]], to create new works that have become modern standards in the flautist's repertoire.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nUnder the tutelage of his father, who was professor of flute at the [[Marseille Conservatoire]] and Principal Flute of the Marseille Symphony Orchestra, Rampal began playing the flute at the age of 12. He studied the Alt\u00e8s method at the Conservatoire, where he went on to win first prize in the school's annual flute competition in 1937 at age 16. This was also the year of his first public recital at the Salle Mazenod in Marseille. By then, Rampal was playing second flute alongside his father in the Orchestre des Concerts Classiques de Marseille; privately, they played duets together almost every day.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nHowever, his remarkable career in music\u2014which was to span more than half a century\u2014began without the full encouragement of his parents. Rampal's mother and father encouraged him to become a doctor or surgeon, as they felt those professions were more reliable than becoming a professional musician. At the beginning of the Second World War, Rampal duly entered medical school in Marseille, studying there for three years. In 1943, authorities of the [[Nazi]] Occupation of France drafted him for forced labour in Germany. To avoid this, he fled to Paris, where it was easier to avoid detection, by frequently changing his lodgings.\n\nWhile in Paris, Rampal auditioned to study flute at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], where he was taught by [[Gaston Crunelle]] from January 1944. (Years later, he succeeded Crunelle as flute professor at the Conservatoire.) After just four months, Rampal's performance of [[Andr\u00e9 Jolivet|Jolivet]]'s ''Le chant de Linos'' won him the coveted first prize in the conservatory's annual flute competition, an achievement that emulated that of his father Joseph in 1919.<ref>Dorgeuille, ''The French Flute School'', p. 73.</ref><ref group=nb>Joseph won first prize playing Busser's \"Th\u00e8me Vari\u00e9\".</ref>\n\n=== Post-war success ===\nIn 1945, following the [[liberation of Paris]], Rampal was invited by the composer [[Henri Tomasi]]\u2014then conductor of the [[Orchestre National de France]]\u2014to perform the demanding Flute Concerto by [[Jacques Ibert]], written for [[Marcel Moyse]] in 1934, live on French National Radio. It launched his concert career overnight and was the first of many such broadcasts. In promoting the flute as a solo concert instrument at this time, Rampal acknowledged that he took his cue from Moyse. Moyse himself had enjoyed considerable popularity between the wars, although not on a truly international scale. Nevertheless, he was a role model in that he had \"definitely established a tradition for the solo flute\"; Moyse, Rampal said, \"unlocked a door that I continued to push open.\"<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nWith the war over, Rampal embarked on a series of performances: at first, within France; and then, in 1947, in [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Almost from the beginning, he was accompanied by pianist and harpsichordist [[Robert Veyron-Lacroix]], whom he had met at the Paris Conservatoire in 1946.{{#tag:ref|For his first professional recital, given in Marseille in July 1941, Rampal was accompanied by pianist Pierre Barbizet.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jprampal.com/bio | title=Rep\u00e8res Biographiques | publisher=Association Jean-Pierre Rampal | trans-title=Biographical | work=Association Jean-Pierre Rampal | accessdate=2010-11-26 | language=French}}</ref>|group=nb}} By contrast with, as Rampal saw it, his own somewhat emotional Proven\u00e7al temperament, Veyron-Lacroix was a more refined character (a \"true upper class Parisian\"), but each immediately found with the other a musical partnership in perfect balance. The appearance of this duo after the war has been described as a \"complete novelty\", allowing them to make a rapid impact on the music-going public in France and elsewhere.<ref>{{Citation | last=Verroust | first=Denis | others=Jean-Pierre Rampal | title=Jean-Pierre Rampal: Le premier virtuose moderne | publisher=Traversiere | page=26 | id=210/271-272-273 | type=CD liner}}</ref> In March 1949, in the face of some scepticism, they hired the [[Salle Gaveau]] in Paris to perform what then seemed the radical idea of a recital programme made up solely of chamber music for flute. It was one of the first flute/piano recitals the city had seen, and caused a \"sensation\".<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite news | title=Obituary: 'Jean-Pierre Rampal' | date=22 May 2000 | last=Joyce | first=Laurence | newspaper=The Independent}}</ref> The success encouraged Rampal to continue along that track. The recital was repeated the following year in Paris, and news of the young flute-player's virtuosity spread. Throughout the early 1950s, the duo made regular radio broadcasts and gave concerts within France and elsewhere in Europe. Their first international tour came in 1953: an island-hopping journey through Indonesia where [[ex-pat]] audiences received them warmly. From 1954 onwards came his first concerts in eastern Europe\u2014most significantly in Prague, where he premiered Jindrich Feld's ''Flute Concerto'' in 1956. In the same year, he appeared in Canada\u2014where, at the Menton festival, he played for the first time in concert with violinist Isaac Stern, who not only became a lifelong friend but also proved a considerable influence on Rampal's own approach to musical expression.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite interview|title=Interview with Jean-Pierre Rampal|last=Rampal|first= ean-Pierre|interviewer= Peter Griffiths\t| location = London|date=November 1982| work = BBC Radio}}</ref>\n\nBy now, Rampal had America in his sights, and on 14 February 1958 he and  Veyron-Lacroix made their US debut with a recital of [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Bach]], [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]], and [[Prokofiev]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the [[Library of Congress]]. Afterwards, Day Thorpe, music critic for the ''Washington Star'', wrote: \"Although I have heard many great flute players, the magic of Rampal still seems to be unique. In his hands, the flute is three or four music makers \u2013 dark and ominous, bright and pastoral, gay and salty, amorous and limpid. The virtuosity of the technique in rapid passages simply cannot be indicated in words.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/rampal-jean-pierre-biography | title=Rampal, Jean-Pierre | publisher=eNotes.com | work=eNotes | accessdate=26 November 2010 | last=Burgess | first=Marjorie}}</ref> In 1959, Rampal gave his first important concert in [[New York City]], at the Town Hall. Rampal's successful partnership with Veyron-Lacroix produced many award-winning recordings, notably their 1962 double LP of the complete Bach flute sonatas. They performed and toured together for some 35 years, until the early 1980s, when Veyron-Lacroix was forced to retire owing to ill-health. Rampal then formed a new and also long-running musical partnership with American pianist [[John Steele Ritter]].\n\nEven as he pursued his career as a soloist, Rampal remained a dedicated ensemble player throughout his life. In 1946, he and [[oboist]] Pierre Pierlot founded the Quintette a Vent Francais (French Wind Quintet), formed of a group of musical friends who had made their way through the war: Rampal, Pierlot, [[clarinettist]] [[Jacques Lancelot]], [[bassoonist]] Paul Hongne, and [[French horn|horn]]-player [[Gilbert Coursier]]. Early in 1944 they had played together, broadcasting at night from a secret \"cave\" radio station at the [[Pierre Schaeffer#Club d'essai & the origin of musique concr\u00e8te|Club d\u2019essai]] in rue de Bec, Paris\u2014a programme of music outlawed by the Nazis, including works with Jewish links by composers such as [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]]. The Quintet remained active until the 1960s.\n\nBetween 1955 and 1962, Rampal took up the post of Principal Flute at the [[Op\u00e9ra National de Paris|Paris Opera]], traditionally the most prestigious orchestral position open to a French flautist. Having been married in 1947 and now a father of two, the post offered him a regular income to offset the vagaries of the freelance life, even though his solo career as a recording artist was developing rapidly. That career was to take him away from the Paris Opera House for extended periods during his tenure there.\n\n=== Recovering the Baroque ===\nRampal's first commercial recording, made in 1946 for the Boite a Musique label in Montparnasse, Paris, was of Mozart's Flute Quartet in D, with the Trio Pasquier. Among composers, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] was to remain his principal love (\"Mozart, it is true, is a god for me\", he said in his autobiography),<ref name=\"autobio\"/> but Mozart by no means formed the cornerstone of Rampal's works. A key element in Rampal's success in the years immediately after World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II\u2014aside from his evident ability\u2014was his passion for the music of the [[Baroque]] era. Aside from a few works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], Baroque music was still largely unrecognised when Rampal started out. He was well aware that his determination to promote the flute as a prominent solo instrument required a wide and flexible repertoire to support the endeavour. Accordingly, he seems to have been clear in his own mind from the beginning about the importance, as a ready-made resource, of the so-called \"Golden Age of the Flute\", as the Baroque era had become known. Hundreds of [[concerto]]s and [[Chamber music|chamber works]] written for the flute in the 18th century had fallen into obscurity, and he recognised that the sheer abundance of this early material might offer long-term possibilities for an aspiring soloist.\n\nRampal was not the first flute player to have taken an interest in the Baroque. The catalogue of flute music recorded on [[78 rpm|78&nbsp;rpm]] discs reveals that there was some prior taste for the music of Vivaldi, [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti|Scarlatti]], [[Jean-Marie Leclair|Leclair]], [[Jean Baptiste Loeillet of Ghent|Loeillet]], and others. [[Claude-Paul Taffanel]], widely held to be the father of the [[French Flute School]], had a liking for the music of the Baroque and was the first to revive interest in the flute sonatas of J.S. Bach and the flute concertos of Mozart.<ref>Dorgeuille, ''The French Flute School'', p. 16.</ref> Taffanel's pupil [[Louis Fleury]] continued this interest through his Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts d\u2019Autrefois and his performances with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Moderne des Instruments \u00e0 Vent, and he also supervised the publication of a number of scores. Marcel Moyse, who took the flute to a new level of popularity between the First and Second World Wars, recorded pieces by Telemann, Schultze, and [[Couperin]]; of Bach's work, he recorded the [[Brandenburg concertos]], the [[Orchestral Suites (Bach)#Suite No. 2 in B minor, BWV 1067|Suite No. 2 in B Minor]] for flute and orchestra, and the ''Trio'' Sonata for Flute, Violin, and Bass, BWV 1038. Likewise, Rene le Roy, an equally celebrated soloist in Europe and America during the 1930s and 1940s, achieved success with performances of Baroque sonatas, and also made interpreting Bach's [[Partita in A minor for solo flute|Partita in A minor for unaccompanied flute, BWV 1013]] a personal speciality after the piece was rediscovered in 1917.<ref>Dorgeuille, ''The French Flute School''</ref>\n\nRampal pursued his passion for the Baroque repertoire systematically and with extraordinary enthusiasm. Even before World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II, he had begun collecting obscure sheet music from the Baroque\u2014making himself familiar with original publishers and catalogues, even though very few published editions were then available. He went on to research in libraries and archives in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Turin, and every other major city he performed in, and corresponded with others across the musical world. From original sources, he developed a detailed understanding of the Baroque style. He studied [[Johann Joachim Quantz|Quantz]] and his famous treatise ''On Playing The Flute'' (1752), and later acquired an original copy of it. For Rampal, the Baroque legacy was fuel to set alight a renewed interest in the flute, and it was his energy in pursuing this goal that set him apart from his forebears. Whereas Le Roy, Laurent and Barr\u00e8re had all recorded two or three of Bach's flute sonatas between 1929 and 1939, between 1947 and 1950 Rampal recorded all of them for Bo\u00eete \u00e0 Musique, and was beginning to regularly perform the complete Bach sonatas in recital, organising them across two evenings. Also, as early as 1950\u201351 he became the first to record all six of Vivaldi's Op.10 concertos, an exercise he was to repeat several times in later years.<ref>Verroust, liner notes, ''Le premier virtuose'', pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nRampal had sensed that the time was right. In an interview with the ''New York Times'', he offered one explanation for the appeal of Baroque music after the war: \"With all this bad mess we had in Europe during the war, people were looking for something quieter, more structured, more well balanced than Romantic music.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DD113DF930A35757C0A96E948260 | title=Is There Life After Rampal? | publisher=The New York Times | date=3 April 1988 | accessdate=26 November 2010 | last=Wright | first=David | newspaper=The New York Times | location=New York}}</ref>\nIn the process of excavating forgotten works for performance, Rampal also had to discover new ways of playing that era's music. He applied his own bright tone and the liveliness and freedom of his style to the original texts, developing along the way a very individual approach to interpretation and, after the Baroque style, to improvised ornamentation.<ref group=nb>His 1970s recording of four Tartini concertos (ERATO STU 71061) is a good example of this enterprise, although the manner of the decorated repeats, as played by Rampal, was based on original notes and directions by Tartini himself and not simply the result of some loosely imagined Baroque \"style\".</ref> Throughout, Rampal was never tempted to perform on a period instrument; the movement that championed \"authentic\" instruments for \"true\" performance of Baroque music had not yet emerged. Instead, he drew on the full range of effects offered by the modern flute to reveal fresh elegance and nuance to Baroque compositions. It was this modernity\u2013the richness and clarity of his sound and the freedom and personality in his expression\u2013combined with a sense of hidden treasures being shared that caught the attention of a wider musical public. \"Enchantment is the best possible word to describe this concert\", said one Canadian reviewer for ''Le Devoir'' in 1956; \"Rampal's playing struck me through its variety, its flexibility, its colour and above all its liveliness.\"<ref>quoted by Verroust, liner notes, ''Le premier virtuose'', p. 34.</ref> This striking effect can be heard on his earliest recordings, between 1946 and 1950. During this period, Rampal quickly benefited from the birth of the long-playing gramophone record. Before 1950, all of his recordings were on 78&nbsp;rpm discs. After 1950, the [[LP record|33\u2153&nbsp;rpm long-playing]] era allowed much greater freedom to accommodate the rate at which he was committing performances to record. At the same time, the birth of the television age ensured Rampal a wider prominence in France than any previous flute-player, through his many concert and recital appearances in the late 1950s and beyond.\n\nThus, even in the first 15 years after the war, Rampal covered a huge amount of ground in this enterprise, and the post-war rediscovery of the Baroque became inseparable from Rampal's own developing solo career. A great deal of the material Rampal performed and recorded he also published, supervising sheet music collections in both Europe and the US. In his autobiography, he remarked that he had felt it part of his \"duty\" to expand as much as possible the repertoire for fellow flautists as well as for himself. In trying to keep the flute before the musical public in the widest sense possible, Rampal also played in as many groups and combinations as he could, a habit he continued for the rest of his life.<ref>Verroust, liner notes, ''Le premier virtuose'', p. 26: \"No other flutist ever played so often with his peers.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1952 he founded the Ensemble Baroque de Paris, featuring Rampal himself, Veyron-Lacroix, Pierlot, Hongne, and [[violin]]ist Robert Gendre. Remaining together over almost three decades, the ensemble proved one of the first musical groups to bring to light the chamber repertoire of the 18th century.\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nThrough his recordings for labels including L'Oiseau-Lyre and, from the mid-1950s, Erato, Rampal continued to give new currency to many \"lost\" concertos by Italian composers such as [[Tartini]], [[Cimarosa]], [[Giovanni Battista Sammartini|Sammartini]], and [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]] (often collaborating with Claudio Scimone and I Solisti Veneti), and French composers including [[Devienne]], [[Jean-Marie Leclair|Leclair]], and [[Jean Baptiste Loeillet of Ghent|Loeillet]], as well as other works from the Potsdam court of the flute-playing king Frederick the Great. His 1955 collaboration in Prague with Czech flautist, composer, and conductor [[Milan Munclinger]] resulted in an award-winning recording of flute concertos by [[Franz Benda|Benda]] and [[Franz Xaver Richter|Richter]]. In 1956, with Louis Froment, he recorded concertos in A minor and G major by [[C.P.E. Bach]]. Other composers of the era, such as [[Haydn]], [[Handel]], [[Johann Stamitz|Stamitz]], and [[Quantz]], also figured significantly in his repertoire. He was open to experimentation; once, through laborious over-dubbing, he played all five parts in an early recording of a flute quintet by [[Boismortier]].  Rampal was the first flautist to record most, if not all, of the flute works by Bach, Handel, Telemann, Vivaldi, and other composers who now comprise the core repertoire for flute players.\n\nDespite his commitment to the Baroque, Rampal extended his researches into the Classical and Romantic eras in order to establish some continuity to the repertoire of his instrument. For example, his first \"recital\" LP, released in both America and Europe, featured music from Bach, Beethoven, Hindemith, Honegger, and Dukas.<ref>Verroust, liner notes, ''Le premier virtuose'', p.35.</ref> Aside from recording familiar composers such as [[Mozart]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], and [[Schubert]], Rampal also helped bring the works of composers such as [[Carl Reinecke|Reinecke]], [[Louis Gianella|Gianella]], and [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]] back into view. Additionally, while the Baroque had provided the platform for his revival of the flute, Rampal was well aware that the health of its continuing appeal depended on him and others displaying the whole range of the repertoire. From the start, his recital programmes included modern compositions as well. Rampal gave the first Western performance of [[Prokofiev]]'s Sonata for Flute and Piano in D, which in the 1940s was in danger of being co-opted for the violin, but which has since become established as a flute favourite. Over his career, he performed all of the flute masterpieces that were composed in the first half of the 20th century, including works by [[Debussy]], [[Ravel]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]], [[Ibert]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Bohuslav Martin\u016f|Martin\u016f]], [[Hindemith]], [[Honegger]], [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]], [[Jean Fran\u00e7aix|Fran\u00e7aix]], [[Jean-Michel Damase|Damase]], and [[Jind\u0159ich Feld|Feld]].\n\nBy the early 1960s, Rampal was established as the first truly international modern flute virtuoso, and was performing with many of the world's leading orchestras.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nAs a chamber musician, he continued to collaborate with numerous other soloists, forming particularly close and long-lasting collaborations with violinist [[Isaac Stern]] and [[cello|cellist]] [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]. A number of composers wrote especially for Rampal, including [[Henri Tomasi]] (''Sonatine pour fl\u00fbte seule'', 1949), [[Jean Fran\u00e7aix]] (''Divertimento'', 1953), [[Andr\u00e9 Jolivet]] (''Concerto'', 1949), [[Jind\u0159ich Feld]] (''Sonata'', 1957), and [[Jean Martinon]] (''Sonatine''). Others included [[Jean Rivier]], [[Antoine Tisn\u00e9]], [[Serge Nigg]], [[Charles Chaynes]], and [[Maurice Ohana]]. In addition, he premiered a large number of works by contemporary composers such as [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Ezra Laderman]], [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]. His transcribing in 1968, at the composer's own suggestion, of [[Aram Khatchaturian]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Khachaturian)|Violin Concerto]] (recorded 1970) showed Rampal's willingness to broaden the flute repertoire further by borrowing from other instruments. In 1978, the Armenian-American composer [[Alan Hovhaness]] wrote his Symphony No. 36, which contained a melodic flute part tailored especially for Rampal, who gave the premiere performance of the work in concert with the National Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe only piece dedicated to Rampal that he never publicly performed was the ''Sonatine'' (1946) by [[Pierre Boulez]], which\u2014with its spiky, explosive figures and extravagant use of flutter-tonguing\u2014he found too abstract for his taste.<ref group=nb>It was left for [[Severino Gazzelloni]] to premiere the ''Sonatine'' in 1954.</ref> Elsewhere, when sometimes criticised for not playing enough contemporary avant-garde work\u2014\"Avant garde of what?\" he would ask{{attribution needed|date=November 2010}}\u2014Rampal confirmed his aversion to music that looked \"like the blueprints for a plumber... pieces that go tweak, twonk, thump, snort\u2014this doesn't inspire me.\"<ref name=\"independent\"/>\n\nOne piece in particular, written with Rampal in mind, has since become a modern standard in the essential flute repertoire. Rampal's compatriot [[Francis Poulenc]] was commissioned by the [[Coolidge Foundation]] of America in 1957 to write a new flute piece. The composer consulted with Rampal regularly on shaping the flute part, and the result, in Rampal's own words, is \"a pearl of the flute literature\".{{attribution needed|date=November 2010}} The official world premiere of Poulenc's Sonata for Flute and Piano was performed on 17 June 1957 by Rampal, accompanied by the composer, at the [[Strasbourg Festival]]. Unofficially, however, they had performed it a day or two earlier to a distinguished audience of one: the pianist [[Artur Rubinstein]], a friend of Poulenc's, was unable to stay in Strasbourg for the evening of the concert itself, and so the duo obliged him with a private performance. Poulenc was then unable to travel to Washington for the US premiere on 14 February 1958, so Veyron-Lacroix took his place, and the sonata became a key offering in Rampal's US recital debut, helping launch his long-lived trans-Atlantic career.\n\n=== ''L'homme \u00e0 la fl\u00fbte d'or'' ===\nAs the owner of the only solid gold flute (No. 1375) made, in 1869, by the great French craftsman [[Louis Lot]], Rampal was the first internationally renowned \"Man With the Golden Flute\". Rumours of the survival of the 18-carat gold Lot had been circulating in France for years before the Second&nbsp;World&nbsp;War, but no one knew where the piece had gone. In 1948, almost by chance, Rampal acquired the instrument from an antiques dealer who had wanted to melt the instrument down for the gold\u2014evidently unaware that he was in possession of the flute equivalent of a [[Stradivarius]].{{#tag:ref|It had originally been sent to Shanghai, a retirement gift commissioned in the 1860s for French flautist Jean Remusat, who became president of the Shanghai Philharmonic Society; somehow it found its way back to Europe, albeit in pieces.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{cite book | title=Music, My Love | publisher=Random House | last=Rampal | first=Jean Pierre | last2=Wise | first2=Deborah | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-394-56578-1 | oclc=18985910 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/musicmylove00ramp }}</ref>|group=nb}} With family help, Rampal raised enough funds to rescue the precious instrument, and went on to perform and record with it for 11 years.{{#tag:ref|His first performance on record with the unique gold Lot is thought to be the recording he made in April 1948 of Bach's [[Sonata in E minor for flute or recorder and basso continuo|E minor ''Sonata'', BWV 1034]].<ref>Verroust, liner notes, ''Le premier virtuose'', p. 32.</ref>|group=nb}} In interviews, Rampal said he thought the gold\u2014by contrast with silver\u2014made his naturally bright, sparkling sound \"a little darker; the colour is a little warmer, I like it\".<ref name=\"bbc\"/> Only in 1958, when presented during his debut US tour with a 14-carat gold instrument made after the Lot pattern by the [[William S.

After one final recording in London,{{#tag:ref|Thought to be Bach's ''Brandenburg Concerto No. 5'' with the [[Academy of St Martin in the Fields]]<ref name=\"autobio\"/>|group=nb}} he consigned the golden Lot to the safety of a bank vault in France, and thereafter made the Haynes his concert instrument of choice.\n\n=== Celebrity ===\n[[File:Rampal-publicity.jpg|thumb|left|250px|At [[Boston Pops]] show in 1977]]\nThroughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, Rampal remained especially popular in the US and Japan (where he had first toured in 1964). He toured America annually, performing at every leading venue\u2014from Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall to the Hollywood Bowl<ref group=nb>His first concert there was in 1973.</ref>\u2014and was a regular presence at the Mostly Mozart Festival at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] in New York.

He also recorded [[Scott Joplin]] rags and [[Gershwin]], and collaborated with French jazz pianist [[Claude Bolling]]. The [[Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano]] (1975), written by Bolling especially for Rampal, went to the top of the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and remained there for ten years. This raised his profile with the American public even further and led, in January 1981, to a TV appearance on [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', where he played \"Lo, Hear the Gentle Lark\" with [[Miss Piggy]]\u2014and, suitably attired, \"Ease on Down the Road\" in a scene loosely based on the folktale of the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]].<ref>{{cite episode | title=Jean-Pierre Rampal | series=The Muppet Show | serieslink=The Muppet Show | credits=Henson, Jim; Juhl, Jerry; Odell, David; Hinkley, Don (writers) | network=[[Associated Television|ATV]] | airdate=17 January 1981 | season=5 | number=12}}</ref>\n\nBack on the classical stage, he was not afraid to be, as he put it, \"a bit of a ham\"; when performing [[Scott Joplin]]'s ''Ragtime Dance and Stomp'' as a concert hall encore, for example, he provided extra percussion by stamping his feet rhythmically on stage in time to the music.<ref>{{cite episode | title=Rampal\u2014Prince of Flute Players | credits=Duran, Elena (presenter); Griffiths, Peter (producer) | network=BBC | series=Radio 4 | airdate=1983}}</ref>\nMeanwhile, Bolling and Rampal came together again for Bolling's ''Picnic Suite'' (1980) with guitarist [[Alexander Lagoya]], the ''Suite No. 2 for Flute and Jazz Piano'' (1987), and also to perform the instrumental theme song \"Goodbye For Now\" by Stephen Sondheim for ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'', [[Warren Beatty]]'s Oscar-winning 1981 movie about the Communist revolution in Russia.

Younger flutists assiduously studied and tried to copy his approaches to tonguing, fingering, embouchure (the position of the lips on the mouthpiece) and breathing.\"<ref name=\"nytobit\"/>\n\nAside from his own recorded legacy, it was as much through his inspiration of other musicians that Rampal's contribution can be appreciated. Throughout the busiest years of his concert career, Rampal continued to find time to teach others, encouraging his students to listen not only to other flute players, but also to take inspiration from other great musical interpreters\u2014be they pianists, violinists, or singers. He maintained a clear opinion about the right balance between \"virtuosity\" and aspiring to real musical expressiveness. \"Of course,\" he said, \"you have to master all the problems of technique to be free to express yourself through your instrument. You can have a big imagination and a big heart but you cannot express it without technique. But the first quality you must have to be good, to be inspiring, is the sound. Without the sound you cannot achieve anything. The tone, the sound, the sonorit\u00e9 is most important. Otherwise, with the fingers alone it is not enough... everyone these days has the fingers, the virtuosity... but the sound, the tone, that's not so easy.\"<ref name=\"bbc\"/>\n\nFollowing the foundation of the Nice Summer Academy in 1959, Rampal held classes there annually until 1977. In 1969 he succeeded Gaston Crunelle as flute professor at the Paris Conservatoire, a position he held until 1981. When 21-year-old [[James Galway]] sought Rampal out in Paris in the early 1960s, Galway felt that he was going to meet \"the master\".

The last work of importance dedicated to him was Krzysztof Penderecki's Flute Concerto, which he premiered in Switzerland in 1992, followed by its first performance in America at Lincoln Center. Rampal's last public recital was held at the Theatre Villamarta in Jerez de la Frontera (Spain) in November 1999, when he was 77; he performed works by Bach, Mozart, Kuhlau and Mendelssohn.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} His last recording was made with the Pasquier Trio and flautist Claudi Arimany (trio and quartets by Mozart and Hoffmeister) in Paris in December 1999.<ref>Verroust, liner notes, ''Le premier virtuose'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nAfter Rampal died in Paris of heart failure in May 2000 at age 78, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] led the tributes, saying \"his flute spoke to the heart.

Strangely, with his enduring international fame assured, Rampal himself came to feel in later years that his own reputation within his native France had in some way diminished. It was \"curious\", he wrote in ''Le Monde'' in 1990, that no French music critics appeared to take any notice of his latest recordings: \"Everything continues as if I didn't exist\", he said; \"This doesn't matter; I still play to full houses.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2000/0610/00061000115_pf.html | title=World-renowned French flautist with magical gift for music | date=10 June 2000 | accessdate=27 November 2010 | newspaper=Irish Times}}</ref>\nBut after his death, there was no shortage of public accolades to reflect the fact that he was indeed a source of national pride.\n\nThe [[Jean-Pierre Rampal Flute Competition]], begun in his honour in 1980 and open to flautists of all nationalities born after 8 November 1971, is held tri-annually as part of the Concours internationaux de la Ville de Paris.\n\nIn June 2005, the [[Association Jean-Pierre Rampal]] was founded in France to perpetuate the study and appreciation of Rampal's contribution to the art of flute-playing. Among other projects, which include maintaining the Jean-Pierre Rampal Archive, the association has collaborated in the re-release on the Premier Horizons label of a number of early Rampal performances on CD.\n\n== Discography ==\nRampal's earliest recordings, 1946\u20131950, were on 78&nbsp;rpm discs, many for the Parisian \"Boite a Musique\" label. With the opening of the 33&nbsp;rpm LP era, he recorded for over 20 different labels between 1950 and 1970. Among the most significant of these was the French Erato label, founded in 1953, for whom he made approximately 100 recordings (several issued in the US on the [[RCA Red Seal]] label). In 1964 alone he recorded 17 albums, including three complete sets of flute pieces by Mozart, Handel, and Beethoven, in addition to concertos and other works. In 1979, he signed an exclusive contract with the CBS label (later Sony Classical), and he made over 60 albums for them.\n\nThis proliferation proved bewildering even to Rampal himself.

These three volumes, comprising over 40 CDs (vo.1: 1954\u201363, vol.2: 1963\u201369, vol.3: 1970\u201382), stand alongside the complete HMV recordings (1951\u201376 on 12 CDs) also re-issued under the Erato label.\n\n== Rampal on TV and DVD ==\nRampal made a great many television concert appearances in France from the late 1950s onwards, and later elsewhere\u2014especially in America and Japan, where his reputation and following remained highest. As the first televised flute-player of any age, the medium contributed to his worldwide popularity in the decades after World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II. By comparison with the vast number of his CD and vinyl recordings in circulation, however, commercially available video and DVD footage of Rampal is relatively scarce, but collectors will be especially interested in four DVDs that contain live or recorded performances by him:\n\n;''Jean-Pierre Rampal''\n:''EMI \"Classic Archive\" DVB 51089991; released 2007 in collaboration with the Association Jean-Pierre Rampal''\n: This presents a collection of fine early performances filmed for French TV between 1958 and 1965 and still held in the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel, the national French television archive. The earliest footage was broadcast on 17 March 1958, in the musical TV series ''Les Grandes Interpr\u00e8tes'', soon after Rampal had returned from his successful debut tour of the US.\n:He begins with Handel's Sonata in F (HWV.369), then plays Debussy's ''The Little Shepherd'' and Ravel's ''Pi\u00e8ce en forme de habanera'', both transcribed for flute and piano; and also Jolivet's ''Incantation C'' for unaccompanied flute. For the Handel, Debussy, and Ravel pieces, he is accompanied by the programme's presenter, pianist [[Bernard Gavoty]]. After a performance of Vivaldi's ''La Notte'' concerto in G minor RV 439 with the Collegium Musicum de Paris (broadcast 8 October 1963) comes a rendition of J.S. Bach's Suite in C minor BWV 997 (Paris, 16 April 1963) and the opening Allegro from Bach's Sonata in G minor BWV 1020 (Paris, broadcast 28 December 1964), both with Veyron-Lacroix at the harpsichord. More of this duo in recital at the Salle Gaveau in Paris (19 March 1964) appears from the TV series the [[Jeunesses musicales de France]], featuring Couperin's Concert Royal No. 4, parts of J. S. Bach's Partita in A minor for solo flute and a sonata in B flat, K.15, by Mozart. The two concerto performances that complete the collection, both with the Orchestre Philharmonique de l'ORTF conducted by Rampal's long-time collaborator Louis de Froment, are of Mozart's Concerto No. 1 in G, K.313 (Paris, 5 May 1965), and the Ibert flute concerto (Paris, 8 April 1962). Of the Mozart concertos, Rampal said in a BBC Radio 4 interview that he did not like his 1966 recording with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra for ERATO because his playing was adversely affected by the uncomfortably high orchestral pitch insisted upon in Vienna. By contrast, he said he preferred his 1978 recording with the \u2018Israel Symphony Orchestra\u2019, even though it does not compare particularly well with the earlier TV performance.<ref name=\"bbc\"/>\n;''Francis Poulenc and Friends''\n:''EMI 'Classic Archive' DVB 3102019''\n: Rampal, playing the Poulenc flute sonata, is featured twice in this compilation, once with Poulenc himself in 1959 and again after the composer's death in 1963. The initial footage, preserved in the national French TV archive, is of a televised concert given by Poulenc in Paris at the Salle Gaveau in 1959. After a brief interview with the composer, Poulenc is joined on set by Rampal to perform the slow ''Cantilena'' from the flute Sonata. Rampal is seen again later in footage from a TV broadcast in which he plays the complete Flute Sonata, this time accompanied by  Veyron-Lacroix. Additional performances of Poulenc's music are provided by artists including pianist Jacques F\u00e9vrier, cellist Maurice Gendron, baritone Gabriel Bacquier, organist Jean-Jacques Grunenwald, soprano Denise Duval and others, together with the ORTF National Orchestra conducted by Georges Pr\u00eatre.\n;''The Art of Jean-Pierre Rampal 1956\u20131966''\n:''Video Artists International''\n: This is a two-volume DVD compilation featuring a series of Radio-Canada \"Telecasts\", broadcast and recorded during the years when Rampal was at the peak of his fame. In this rare footage, retrieved from the archives of CBC Montreal, Rampal is accompanied by Veyron-Lacroix and the McGill Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Alexander Brott. The first volume of this set of live broadcasts includes: Boccherini's Concerto for Flute and Orchestra in D major (broadcast 1 March 1956); Haydn's Concerto for flute, harpsichord and string orchestra in F major, with Debussy's ''Syrinx for unaccompanied flute'' (broadcast March 28, 1957); Couperin's Concert Royal IV, with J. S. Bach's Sonata for flute and harpsichord in G minor, BWV 1020 (broadcast 27 December 1961). Volume two features Mozart's Flute Concerto No. 2 in D major, K.314, together with the Flute Concerto No. 1 in G major, K.313 (broadcast 24 February 1966).\n;''Bolling: Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano''\n: This features a live televised performance from 1976 of Claude Bolling's cross-over ''Suite'' (1973), written for Jean-Pierre Rampal (who plays a classical line to Bolling's jazz piano) and which by then had become a runaway success in the ''Billboard'' charts. Special guest double-bass player Max Hediguer is also featured.\n\n== Radio ==\nApart from the many French Radio broadcasts of performances by Rampal, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 45-minute profile, ''Rampal\u2013\"Prince of Flute Players\"'', on 11 October 1983 in the 20:20\u201321:05 documentary slot. It contained extracts from an interview with Rampal himself, rare for the fact that Rampal gave very few interviews of any length in English. Rampal talks about his life and times and his approach to music-making. Also featured are interviews with English flautist William Bennett, American flautist and Rampal's sometimes-pupil Elena Duran, and violinist Isaac Stern\u2014who was Rampal's long-time friend and musical collaborator. The programme is kept in the [[BBC Sound Archive]], together with the two unedited original interviews with Rampal that it draws on (both recorded by Griffiths in London, in January 1981 and November 1982, at the Westbury Hotel, off Regent Street, where Rampal normally stayed).\n\n==Films==\n''L. Subramaniam: Violin From the Heart'' (1999), directed by Jean Henri Meunier, includes a scene of Rampal performing with [[L. Subramaniam]].)\n\nRampal also makes an appearance in the 1977 educational film ''The Joy of Bach'', playing his flute on a rooftop in France.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n'''Bel Canto Flute: The Rampal School''' (2003; Winzer Press) by Sheryl Cohen is a study of Rampal's methods and influence by an American flautist and teacher who studied with both Jean-Pierre Rampal and his fellow Marseille flautist [[Alain Marion]]. It is controversial to refer to the Marseilles group of flute players as a \"school\" distinct from the more widely acknowledged \"French Flute School\" in which Marcel Moyse and his predecessors Gaubert and Taffanel are central figures, but Cohen's study is an attempt to give Joseph Rampal, together with his son Jean-Pierre and others, some formal credit for an identifiable style of playing that became appreciated right around the musical world. As signature characteristics of this style, Cohen points in particular to a \"poetic approach to expressive [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] as a foundation to develop musical artistry, creative practice methods, breath control tone, articulation, and technique, all while searching to free the artist from within.\" The book, which draws on the contents of Jean-Pierre Rampal's masterclasses, includes 34 etudes, 33 solo movements and a set of daily studies used as teaching materials by both Rampal and by Marion. Sheryl Cohen, Professor Emerita of Music at the University of Alabama, has since extended her study by also running a Fellowship at the Camargo Foundation in Cassis in Provence entitled ''The Flute School of Marseille: The Rampal Lineage''. The course chronicles \"the development and influence of the school of Joseph Rampal on flute playing in the twentieth century\" in order to \"preserve the vast philosophical and pedagogical project mounted by the school, and establish Joseph Rampal's proper place in the history of the flute.\"\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://jprampal.com/ ''L'Association Jean-Pierre Rampal'']\n*[http://www.civp.com/rampal/rampalgb/arampalgb.html Jean Pierre-Rampal Flute Competition] The 8th Jean-Pierre Rampal International Flute Competition is to be held in Paris, from 23 September to 4 October 2008, as part of the Concours internationaux de la Ville de Paris.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091030133113/http://www.fanfaire.com/rampal/index.html ''Fanfaire'' tributes to Rampal]\n*[http://classicalmusicianstoza.blogspot.ca/2014/06/jean-pierre-rampal-french-flautist-and.html Some programs, introduction and photos from his 3 acclaimed tours of Southern Africa, 1959\u201373]\n*[http://pryordodge.com/JP_Rampal.html Photographs of Jean-Pierre Rampal] at the Acad\u00e9mie Internationale d'Et\u00e9 in Nice, 1968 & 1970\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100213233536/http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/photos/winigrad/rampal.html Photographs of Rampal] in rehearsal with Aaron Copland at Saratoga Springs, New York, 1979\n* [http://classicalmusicianstoza.blogspot.ca/2014/06/french-wind-quintet.html J-P Rampal touring Southern Africa with the French Wind Quintet, 1963]\n\n{{L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize laureates}}\n{{Gramophone Hall of Fame}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rampal, Jean-Pierre}}\n[[Category:People from Marseille]]\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2000 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni]]\n[[Category:French classical flautists]]\n[[Category:Academics of the Conservatoire de Paris]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize]]\n[[Category:20th-century classical musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century French musicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|French flutist}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{weasel|date=November 2010}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox musician\n| name         = Jean-Pierre Rampal\n|background = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| image          = Jean Pierre Rampal.jpg\n| birth_name   = Jean-Pierre Louis Rampal\n| birth_date         = {{Birth date|1922|01|07|df=y}}\n|birth_place =[[Marseille]], France\n| death_date         = {{Death date and age|2000|05|20|1922|01|07|df=y}}\n|death_place =Paris, France\n| occupation   = [[Flautist]]\n| years_active = 1940s\u20132000\n}}\n\n'''Jean-Pierre Louis Rampal''' (7 January 1922 \u2013 20 May 2000) was a French [[flautist]].

As it was unusual for solo flute to be featured widely in orchestral concerts, this was not easily done in the immediate years after World War II; however, Rampal's flair and presence\u2014he was a big man to wield such a slim instrument\u2014paved the way for the next generation of flautist superstars such as [[James Galway]] and [[Emmanuel Pahud]].\n\nRampal was a player in the classical French flute tradition,  although behind his superior technical facility lay the cavalier 'Latin' temperament of the Mediterranean south, rather than the more formal character of the elite north Parisian institutions. His father was taught by Hennebains, who also taught Rene le Roy and [[Marcel Moyse]].<ref name=\"frenchflute\">{{cite book | title=The French Flute School, 1860\u20131950 | publisher=Tony Bingham | last=Dorgeuille | first=Claude | year=1986 | isbn=978-0-946113-02-6 | others=Trans.

Joseph Rampal went on to win the First Prize in the Conservatoire's annual flute competition in 1919.</ref> His playing style was characterised by a bright sound, a sonorous elegance of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] lit up by a rich palette of subtle tone colours. He exuded a dashing, lightly articulated virtuosity that thrilled audiences in his heyday, and his natural vibrato varied according to the emotion of the music he played. Additionally, Rampal was able to breathe in the middle of extended rapid passages without losing the sweep of his rendition. His upper register and wide dynamic range were particularly notable, as was the lightness and crispness of his staccato articulation (his \"d\u00e9tach\u00e9\") heard on his early recordings.{{#tag:ref|English flautist William Bennett cites this particular characteristic of Rampal's playing as a point of skill he wished to improve when he sought out Rampal in Paris for tuition;<ref name=\"bennett-dufrene\"/>{{self-published inline|date=November 2010}}\nBennett also speaks about this in the 1983 BBC Radio 4 profile \"Rampal\u2014Prince of Flute-Players\" where Rampal himself surmises that a native French-speaker's natural facility for producing the ''tu'' sound in speech was one reason why the articulation of many French flute-players was so good.|group=nb}}\n\nRampal is best known for popularising the flute in the post\u2013World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II years, recovering a vast number of flute compositions from the [[Baroque]] era, and spurring contemporary composers, such as [[Francis Poulenc]], to create new works that have become modern standards in the flautist's repertoire.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nUnder the tutelage of his father, who was professor of flute at the [[Marseille Conservatoire]] and Principal Flute of the Marseille Symphony Orchestra, Rampal began playing the flute at the age of 12. He studied the Alt\u00e8s method at the Conservatoire, where he went on to win first prize in the school's annual flute competition in 1937 at age 16. This was also the year of his first public recital at the Salle Mazenod in Marseille. By then, Rampal was playing second flute alongside his father in the Orchestre des Concerts Classiques de Marseille; privately, they played duets together almost every day.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nHowever, his remarkable career in music\u2014which was to span more than half a century\u2014began without the full encouragement of his parents. Rampal's mother and father encouraged him to become a doctor or surgeon, as they felt those professions were more reliable than becoming a professional musician. At the beginning of the Second World War, Rampal duly entered medical school in Marseille, studying there for three years. In 1943, authorities of the [[Nazi]] Occupation of France drafted him for forced labour in Germany. To avoid this, he fled to Paris, where it was easier to avoid detection, by frequently changing his lodgings.\n\nWhile in Paris, Rampal auditioned to study flute at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], where he was taught by [[Gaston Crunelle]] from January 1944. (Years later, he succeeded Crunelle as flute professor at the Conservatoire.) After just four months, Rampal's performance of [[Andr\u00e9 Jolivet|Jolivet]]'s ''Le chant de Linos'' won him the coveted first prize in the conservatory's annual flute competition, an achievement that emulated that of his father Joseph in 1919.<ref>Dorgeuille, ''The French Flute School'', p. 73.</ref><ref group=nb>Joseph won first prize playing Busser's \"Th\u00e8me Vari\u00e9\".</ref>\n\n=== Post-war success ===\nIn 1945, following the [[liberation of Paris]], Rampal was invited by the composer [[Henri Tomasi]]\u2014then conductor of the [[Orchestre National de France]]\u2014to perform the demanding Flute Concerto by [[Jacques Ibert]], written for [[Marcel Moyse]] in 1934, live on French National Radio. It launched his concert career overnight and was the first of many such broadcasts. In promoting the flute as a solo concert instrument at this time, Rampal acknowledged that he took his cue from Moyse. Moyse himself had enjoyed considerable popularity between the wars, although not on a truly international scale. Nevertheless, he was a role model in that he had \"definitely established a tradition for the solo flute\"; Moyse, Rampal said, \"unlocked a door that I continued to push open.\"<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nWith the war over, Rampal embarked on a series of performances: at first, within France; and then, in 1947, in [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Almost from the beginning, he was accompanied by pianist and harpsichordist [[Robert Veyron-Lacroix]], whom he had met at the Paris Conservatoire in 1946.{{#tag:ref|For his first professional recital, given in Marseille in July 1941, Rampal was accompanied by pianist Pierre Barbizet.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jprampal.com/bio | title=Rep\u00e8res Biographiques | publisher=Association Jean-Pierre Rampal | trans-title=Biographical | work=Association Jean-Pierre Rampal | accessdate=2010-11-26 | language=French}}</ref>|group=nb}} By contrast with, as Rampal saw it, his own somewhat emotional Proven\u00e7al temperament, Veyron-Lacroix was a more refined character (a \"true upper class Parisian\"), but each immediately found with the other a musical partnership in perfect balance. The appearance of this duo after the war has been described as a \"complete novelty\", allowing them to make a rapid impact on the music-going public in France and elsewhere.<ref>{{Citation | last=Verroust | first=Denis | others=Jean-Pierre Rampal | title=Jean-Pierre Rampal: Le premier virtuose moderne | publisher=Traversiere | page=26 | id=210/271-272-273 | type=CD liner}}</ref> In March 1949, in the face of some scepticism, they hired the [[Salle Gaveau]] in Paris to perform what then seemed the radical idea of a recital programme made up solely of chamber music for flute. It was one of the first flute/piano recitals the city had seen, and caused a \"sensation\".<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite news | title=Obituary: 'Jean-Pierre Rampal' | date=22 May 2000 | last=Joyce | first=Laurence | newspaper=The Independent}}</ref> The success encouraged Rampal to continue along that track. The recital was repeated the following year in Paris, and news of the young flute-player's virtuosity spread. Throughout the early 1950s, the duo made regular radio broadcasts and gave concerts within France and elsewhere in Europe. Their first international tour came in 1953: an island-hopping journey through Indonesia where [[ex-pat]] audiences received them warmly. From 1954 onwards came his first concerts in eastern Europe\u2014most significantly in Prague, where he premiered Jindrich Feld's ''Flute Concerto'' in 1956. In the same year, he appeared in Canada\u2014where, at the Menton festival, he played for the first time in concert with violinist Isaac Stern, who not only became a lifelong friend but also proved a considerable influence on Rampal's own approach to musical expression.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite interview|title=Interview with Jean-Pierre Rampal|last=Rampal|first= ean-Pierre|interviewer= Peter Griffiths\t| location = London|date=November 1982| work = BBC Radio}}</ref>\n\nBy now, Rampal had America in his sights, and on 14 February 1958 he and  Veyron-Lacroix made their US debut with a recital of [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Bach]], [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]], and [[Prokofiev]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the [[Library of Congress]]. Afterwards, Day Thorpe, music critic for the ''Washington Star'', wrote: \"Although I have heard many great flute players, the magic of Rampal still seems to be unique. In his hands, the flute is three or four music makers \u2013 dark and ominous, bright and pastoral, gay and salty, amorous and limpid. The virtuosity of the technique in rapid passages simply cannot be indicated in words.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/rampal-jean-pierre-biography | title=Rampal, Jean-Pierre | publisher=eNotes.com | work=eNotes | accessdate=26 November 2010 | last=Burgess | first=Marjorie}}</ref> In 1959, Rampal gave his first important concert in [[New York City]], at the Town Hall. Rampal's successful partnership with Veyron-Lacroix produced many award-winning recordings, notably their 1962 double LP of the complete Bach flute sonatas. They performed and toured together for some 35 years, until the early 1980s, when Veyron-Lacroix was forced to retire owing to ill-health. Rampal then formed a new and also long-running musical partnership with American pianist [[John Steele Ritter]].\n\nEven as he pursued his career as a soloist, Rampal remained a dedicated ensemble player throughout his life. In 1946, he and [[oboist]] Pierre Pierlot founded the Quintette a Vent Francais (French Wind Quintet), formed of a group of musical friends who had made their way through the war: Rampal, Pierlot, [[clarinettist]] [[Jacques Lancelot]], [[bassoonist]] Paul Hongne, and [[French horn|horn]]-player [[Gilbert Coursier]]. Early in 1944 they had played together, broadcasting at night from a secret \"cave\" radio station at the [[Pierre Schaeffer#Club d'essai & the origin of musique concr\u00e8te|Club d\u2019essai]] in rue de Bec, Paris\u2014a programme of music outlawed by the Nazis, including works with Jewish links by composers such as [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]]. The Quintet remained active until the 1960s.\n\nBetween 1955 and 1962, Rampal took up the post of Principal Flute at the [[Op\u00e9ra National de Paris|Paris Opera]], traditionally the most prestigious orchestral position open to a French flautist. Having been married in 1947 and now a father of two, the post offered him a regular income to offset the vagaries of the freelance life, even though his solo career as a recording artist was developing rapidly. That career was to take him away from the Paris Opera House for extended periods during his tenure there.\n\n=== Recovering the Baroque ===\nRampal's first commercial recording, made in 1946 for the Boite a Musique label in Montparnasse, Paris, was of Mozart's Flute Quartet in D, with the Trio Pasquier. Among composers, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] was to remain his principal love (\"Mozart, it is true, is a god for me\", he said in his autobiography),<ref name=\"autobio\"/> but Mozart by no means formed the cornerstone of Rampal's works. A key element in Rampal's success in the years immediately after World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II\u2014aside from his evident ability\u2014was his passion for the music of the [[Baroque]] era. Aside from a few works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], Baroque music was still largely unrecognised when Rampal started out. He was well aware that his determination to promote the flute as a prominent solo instrument required a wide and flexible repertoire to support the endeavour. Accordingly, he seems to have been clear in his own mind from the beginning about the importance, as a ready-made resource, of the so-called \"Golden Age of the Flute\", as the Baroque era had become known. Hundreds of [[concerto]]s and [[Chamber music|chamber works]] written for the flute in the 18th century had fallen into obscurity, and he recognised that the sheer abundance of this early material might offer long-term possibilities for an aspiring soloist.\n\nRampal was not the first flute player to have taken an interest in the Baroque. The catalogue of flute music recorded on [[78 rpm|78&nbsp;rpm]] discs reveals that there was some prior taste for the music of Vivaldi, [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti|Scarlatti]], [[Jean-Marie Leclair|Leclair]], [[Jean Baptiste Loeillet of Ghent|Loeillet]], and others. [[Claude-Paul Taffanel]], widely held to be the father of the [[French Flute School]], had a liking for the music of the Baroque and was the first to revive interest in the flute sonatas of J.S. Bach and the flute concertos of Mozart.<ref>Dorgeuille, ''The French Flute School'', p. 16.</ref> Taffanel's pupil [[Louis Fleury]] continued this interest through his Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts d\u2019Autrefois and his performances with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Moderne des Instruments \u00e0 Vent, and he also supervised the publication of a number of scores. Marcel Moyse, who took the flute to a new level of popularity between the First and Second World Wars, recorded pieces by Telemann, Schultze, and [[Couperin]]; of Bach's work, he recorded the [[Brandenburg concertos]], the [[Orchestral Suites (Bach)#Suite No. 2 in B minor, BWV 1067|Suite No. 2 in B Minor]] for flute and orchestra, and the ''Trio'' Sonata for Flute, Violin, and Bass, BWV 1038. Likewise, Rene le Roy, an equally celebrated soloist in Europe and America during the 1930s and 1940s, achieved success with performances of Baroque sonatas, and also made interpreting Bach's [[Partita in A minor for solo flute|Partita in A minor for unaccompanied flute, BWV 1013]] a personal speciality after the piece was rediscovered in 1917.<ref>Dorgeuille, ''The French Flute School''</ref>\n\nRampal pursued his passion for the Baroque repertoire systematically and with extraordinary enthusiasm. Even before World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II, he had begun collecting obscure sheet music from the Baroque\u2014making himself familiar with original publishers and catalogues, even though very few published editions were then available. He went on to research in libraries and archives in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Turin, and every other major city he performed in, and corresponded with others across the musical world. From original sources, he developed a detailed understanding of the Baroque style. He studied [[Johann Joachim Quantz|Quantz]] and his famous treatise ''On Playing The Flute'' (1752), and later acquired an original copy of it. For Rampal, the Baroque legacy was fuel to set alight a renewed interest in the flute, and it was his energy in pursuing this goal that set him apart from his forebears. Whereas Le Roy, Laurent and Barr\u00e8re had all recorded two or three of Bach's flute sonatas between 1929 and 1939, between 1947 and 1950 Rampal recorded all of them for Bo\u00eete \u00e0 Musique, and was beginning to regularly perform the complete Bach sonatas in recital, organising them across two evenings. Also, as early as 1950\u201351 he became the first to record all six of Vivaldi's Op.10 concertos, an exercise he was to repeat several times in later years.<ref>Verroust, liner notes, ''Le premier virtuose'', pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nRampal had sensed that the time was right. In an interview with the ''New York Times'', he offered one explanation for the appeal of Baroque music after the war: \"With all this bad mess we had in Europe during the war, people were looking for something quieter, more structured, more well balanced than Romantic music.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DD113DF930A35757C0A96E948260 | title=Is There Life After Rampal? | publisher=The New York Times | date=3 April 1988 | accessdate=26 November 2010 | last=Wright | first=David | newspaper=The New York Times | location=New York}}</ref>\nIn the process of excavating forgotten works for performance, Rampal also had to discover new ways of playing that era's music. He applied his own bright tone and the liveliness and freedom of his style to the original texts, developing along the way a very individual approach to interpretation and, after the Baroque style, to improvised ornamentation.<ref group=nb>His 1970s recording of four Tartini concertos (ERATO STU 71061) is a good example of this enterprise, although the manner of the decorated repeats, as played by Rampal, was based on original notes and directions by Tartini himself and not simply the result of some loosely imagined Baroque \"style\".</ref> Throughout, Rampal was never tempted to perform on a period instrument; the movement that championed \"authentic\" instruments for \"true\" performance of Baroque music had not yet emerged. Instead, he drew on the full range of effects offered by the modern flute to reveal fresh elegance and nuance to Baroque compositions. It was this modernity\u2013the richness and clarity of his sound and the freedom and personality in his expression\u2013combined with a sense of hidden treasures being shared that caught the attention of a wider musical public. \"Enchantment is the best possible word to describe this concert\", said one Canadian reviewer for ''Le Devoir'' in 1956; \"Rampal's playing struck me through its variety, its flexibility, its colour and above all its liveliness.\"<ref>quoted by Verroust, liner notes, ''Le premier virtuose'', p. 34.</ref> This striking effect can be heard on his earliest recordings, between 1946 and 1950. During this period, Rampal quickly benefited from the birth of the long-playing gramophone record. Before 1950, all of his recordings were on 78&nbsp;rpm discs. After 1950, the [[LP record|33\u2153&nbsp;rpm long-playing]] era allowed much greater freedom to accommodate the rate at which he was committing performances to record. At the same time, the birth of the television age ensured Rampal a wider prominence in France than any previous flute-player, through his many concert and recital appearances in the late 1950s and beyond.\n\nThus, even in the first 15 years after the war, Rampal covered a huge amount of ground in this enterprise, and the post-war rediscovery of the Baroque became inseparable from Rampal's own developing solo career. A great deal of the material Rampal performed and recorded he also published, supervising sheet music collections in both Europe and the US. In his autobiography, he remarked that he had felt it part of his \"duty\" to expand as much as possible the repertoire for fellow flautists as well as for himself. In trying to keep the flute before the musical public in the widest sense possible, Rampal also played in as many groups and combinations as he could, a habit he continued for the rest of his life.<ref>Verroust, liner notes, ''Le premier virtuose'', p. 26: \"No other flutist ever played so often with his peers.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1952 he founded the Ensemble Baroque de Paris, featuring Rampal himself, Veyron-Lacroix, Pierlot, Hongne, and [[violin]]ist Robert Gendre. Remaining together over almost three decades, the ensemble proved one of the first musical groups to bring to light the chamber repertoire of the 18th century.\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nThrough his recordings for labels including L'Oiseau-Lyre and, from the mid-1950s, Erato, Rampal continued to give new currency to many \"lost\" concertos by Italian composers such as [[Tartini]], [[Cimarosa]], [[Giovanni Battista Sammartini|Sammartini]], and [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]] (often collaborating with Claudio Scimone and I Solisti Veneti), and French composers including [[Devienne]], [[Jean-Marie Leclair|Leclair]], and [[Jean Baptiste Loeillet of Ghent|Loeillet]], as well as other works from the Potsdam court of the flute-playing king Frederick the Great. His 1955 collaboration in Prague with Czech flautist, composer, and conductor [[Milan Munclinger]] resulted in an award-winning recording of flute concertos by [[Franz Benda|Benda]] and [[Franz Xaver Richter|Richter]]. In 1956, with Louis Froment, he recorded concertos in A minor and G major by [[C.P.E. Bach]]. Other composers of the era, such as [[Haydn]], [[Handel]], [[Johann Stamitz|Stamitz]], and [[Quantz]], also figured significantly in his repertoire. He was open to experimentation; once, through laborious over-dubbing, he played all five parts in an early recording of a flute quintet by [[Boismortier]].  Rampal was the first flautist to record most, if not all, of the flute works by Bach, Handel, Telemann, Vivaldi, and other composers who now comprise the core repertoire for flute players.\n\nDespite his commitment to the Baroque, Rampal extended his researches into the Classical and Romantic eras in order to establish some continuity to the repertoire of his instrument. For example, his first \"recital\" LP, released in both America and Europe, featured music from Bach, Beethoven, Hindemith, Honegger, and Dukas.<ref>Verroust, liner notes, ''Le premier virtuose'', p.35.</ref> Aside from recording familiar composers such as [[Mozart]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], and [[Schubert]], Rampal also helped bring the works of composers such as [[Carl Reinecke|Reinecke]], [[Louis Gianella|Gianella]], and [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]] back into view. Additionally, while the Baroque had provided the platform for his revival of the flute, Rampal was well aware that the health of its continuing appeal depended on him and others displaying the whole range of the repertoire. From the start, his recital programmes included modern compositions as well. Rampal gave the first Western performance of [[Prokofiev]]'s Sonata for Flute and Piano in D, which in the 1940s was in danger of being co-opted for the violin, but which has since become established as a flute favourite. Over his career, he performed all of the flute masterpieces that were composed in the first half of the 20th century, including works by [[Debussy]], [[Ravel]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]], [[Ibert]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Bohuslav Martin\u016f|Martin\u016f]], [[Hindemith]], [[Honegger]], [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]], [[Jean Fran\u00e7aix|Fran\u00e7aix]], [[Jean-Michel Damase|Damase]], and [[Jind\u0159ich Feld|Feld]].\n\nBy the early 1960s, Rampal was established as the first truly international modern flute virtuoso, and was performing with many of the world's leading orchestras.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nAs a chamber musician, he continued to collaborate with numerous other soloists, forming particularly close and long-lasting collaborations with violinist [[Isaac Stern]] and [[cello|cellist]] [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]. A number of composers wrote especially for Rampal, including [[Henri Tomasi]] (''Sonatine pour fl\u00fbte seule'', 1949), [[Jean Fran\u00e7aix]] (''Divertimento'', 1953), [[Andr\u00e9 Jolivet]] (''Concerto'', 1949), [[Jind\u0159ich Feld]] (''Sonata'', 1957), and [[Jean Martinon]] (''Sonatine''). Others included [[Jean Rivier]], [[Antoine Tisn\u00e9]], [[Serge Nigg]], [[Charles Chaynes]], and [[Maurice Ohana]]. In addition, he premiered a large number of works by contemporary composers such as [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Ezra Laderman]], [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]. His transcribing in 1968, at the composer's own suggestion, of [[Aram Khatchaturian]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Khachaturian)|Violin Concerto]] (recorded 1970) showed Rampal's willingness to broaden the flute repertoire further by borrowing from other instruments. In 1978, the Armenian-American composer [[Alan Hovhaness]] wrote his Symphony No. 36, which contained a melodic flute part tailored especially for Rampal, who gave the premiere performance of the work in concert with the National Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe only piece dedicated to Rampal that he never publicly performed was the ''Sonatine'' (1946) by [[Pierre Boulez]], which\u2014with its spiky, explosive figures and extravagant use of flutter-tonguing\u2014he found too abstract for his taste.<ref group=nb>It was left for [[Severino Gazzelloni]] to premiere the ''Sonatine'' in 1954.</ref> Elsewhere, when sometimes criticised for not playing enough contemporary avant-garde work\u2014\"Avant garde of what?\" he would ask{{attribution needed|date=November 2010}}\u2014Rampal confirmed his aversion to music that looked \"like the blueprints for a plumber... pieces that go tweak, twonk, thump, snort\u2014this doesn't inspire me.\"<ref name=\"independent\"/>\n\nOne piece in particular, written with Rampal in mind, has since become a modern standard in the essential flute repertoire. Rampal's compatriot [[Francis Poulenc]] was commissioned by the [[Coolidge Foundation]] of America in 1957 to write a new flute piece. The composer consulted with Rampal regularly on shaping the flute part, and the result, in Rampal's own words, is \"a pearl of the flute literature\".{{attribution needed|date=November 2010}} The official world premiere of Poulenc's Sonata for Flute and Piano was performed on 17 June 1957 by Rampal, accompanied by the composer, at the [[Strasbourg Festival]]. Unofficially, however, they had performed it a day or two earlier to a distinguished audience of one: the pianist [[Artur Rubinstein]], a friend of Poulenc's, was unable to stay in Strasbourg for the evening of the concert itself, and so the duo obliged him with a private performance. Poulenc was then unable to travel to Washington for the US premiere on 14 February 1958, so Veyron-Lacroix took his place, and the sonata became a key offering in Rampal's US recital debut, helping launch his long-lived trans-Atlantic career.\n\n=== ''L'homme \u00e0 la fl\u00fbte d'or'' ===\nAs the owner of the only solid gold flute (No. 1375) made, in 1869, by the great French craftsman [[Louis Lot]], Rampal was the first internationally renowned \"Man With the Golden Flute\". Rumours of the survival of the 18-carat gold Lot had been circulating in France for years before the Second&nbsp;World&nbsp;War, but no one knew where the piece had gone. In 1948, almost by chance, Rampal acquired the instrument from an antiques dealer who had wanted to melt the instrument down for the gold\u2014evidently unaware that he was in possession of the flute equivalent of a [[Stradivarius]].{{#tag:ref|It had originally been sent to Shanghai, a retirement gift commissioned in the 1860s for French flautist Jean Remusat, who became president of the Shanghai Philharmonic Society; somehow it found its way back to Europe, albeit in pieces.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{cite book | title=Music, My Love | publisher=Random House | last=Rampal | first=Jean Pierre | last2=Wise | first2=Deborah | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-394-56578-1 | oclc=18985910 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/musicmylove00ramp }}</ref>|group=nb}} With family help, Rampal raised enough funds to rescue the precious instrument, and went on to perform and record with it for 11 years.{{#tag:ref|His first performance on record with the unique gold Lot is thought to be the recording he made in April 1948 of Bach's [[Sonata in E minor for flute or recorder and basso continuo|E minor ''Sonata'', BWV 1034]].<ref>Verroust, liner notes, ''Le premier virtuose'', p. 32.</ref>|group=nb}} In interviews, Rampal said he thought the gold\u2014by contrast with silver\u2014made his naturally bright, sparkling sound \"a little darker; the colour is a little warmer, I like it\".<ref name=\"bbc\"/> Only in 1958, when presented during his debut US tour with a 14-carat gold instrument made after the Lot pattern by the [[William S. Haynes]] Flute Company of Boston, did Rampal stop using the 1869 original. After one final recording in London,{{#tag:ref|Thought to be Bach's ''Brandenburg Concerto No. 5'' with the [[Academy of St Martin in the Fields]]<ref name=\"autobio\"/>|group=nb}} he consigned the golden Lot to the safety of a bank vault in France, and thereafter made the Haynes his concert instrument of choice.\n\n=== Celebrity ===\n[[File:Rampal-publicity.jpg|thumb|left|250px|At [[Boston Pops]] show in 1977]]\nThroughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, Rampal remained especially popular in the US and Japan (where he had first toured in 1964).

He also recorded [[Scott Joplin]] rags and [[Gershwin]], and collaborated with French jazz pianist [[Claude Bolling]]. The [[Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano]] (1975), written by Bolling especially for Rampal, went to the top of the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and remained there for ten years. This raised his profile with the American public even further and led, in January 1981, to a TV appearance on [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', where he played \"Lo, Hear the Gentle Lark\" with [[Miss Piggy]]\u2014and, suitably attired, \"Ease on Down the Road\" in a scene loosely based on the folktale of the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]].<ref>{{cite episode | title=Jean-Pierre Rampal | series=The Muppet Show | serieslink=The Muppet Show | credits=Henson, Jim; Juhl, Jerry; Odell, David; Hinkley, Don (writers) | network=[[Associated Television|ATV]] | airdate=17 January 1981 | season=5 | number=12}}</ref>\n\nBack on the classical stage, he was not afraid to be, as he put it, \"a bit of a ham\"; when performing [[Scott Joplin]]'s ''Ragtime Dance and Stomp'' as a concert hall encore, for example, he provided extra percussion by stamping his feet rhythmically on stage in time to the music.<ref>{{citation | title=Rampal\u2014Prince of Flute Players | credits=Duran, Elena (presenter); Griffiths, Peter (producer) | network=BBC | station=Radio 4 | airdate=1983}}</ref>\nMeanwhile, Bolling and Rampal came together again for Bolling's ''Picnic Suite'' (1980) with guitarist [[Alexander Lagoya]], the ''Suite No. 2 for Flute and Jazz Piano'' (1987), and also to perform the instrumental theme song \"Goodbye For Now\" by Stephen Sondheim for ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'', [[Warren Beatty]]'s Oscar-winning 1981 movie about the Communist revolution in Russia.

Younger flutists assiduously studied and tried to copy his approaches to tonguing, fingering, embouchure (the position of the lips on the mouthpiece) and breathing.\"<ref name=\"nytobit\"/>\n\nAside from his own recorded legacy, it was as much through his inspiration of other musicians that Rampal's contribution can be appreciated. Throughout the busiest years of his concert career, Rampal continued to find time to teach others, encouraging his students to listen not only to other flute players, but also to take inspiration from other great musical interpreters\u2014be they pianists, violinists, or singers. He maintained a clear opinion about the right balance between \"virtuosity\" and aspiring to real musical expressiveness. \"Of course,\" he said, \"you have to master all the problems of technique to be free to express yourself through your instrument. You can have a big imagination and a big heart but you cannot express it without technique. But the first quality you must have to be good, to be inspiring, is the sound. Without the sound you cannot achieve anything. The tone, the sound, the sonorit\u00e9 is most important. Otherwise, with the fingers alone it is not enough... everyone these days has the fingers, the virtuosity... but the sound, the tone, that's not so easy.\"<ref name=\"bbc\"/>\n\nFollowing the foundation of the Nice Summer Academy in 1959, Rampal held classes there annually until 1977. In 1969 he succeeded Gaston Crunelle as flute professor at the Paris Conservatoire, a position he held until 1981. When 21-year-old [[James Galway]] sought Rampal out in Paris in the early 1960s, Galway felt that he was going to meet \"the master\".

Among other projects, which include maintaining the Jean-Pierre Rampal Archive, the association has collaborated in the re-release on the Premier Horizons label of a number of early Rampal performances on CD.\n\n== Discography ==\nRampal's earliest recordings, 1946\u20131950, were on 78&nbsp;rpm discs, many for the Parisian \"Boite a Musique\" label. With the opening of the 33&nbsp;rpm LP era, he recorded for over 20 different labels between 1950 and 1970. Among the most significant of these was the French Erato label, founded in 1953, for whom he made approximately 100 recordings (several issued in the US on the [[RCA Red Seal]] label). In 1964 alone he recorded 17 albums, including three complete sets of flute pieces by Mozart, Handel, and Beethoven, in addition to concertos and other works. In 1979, he signed an exclusive contract with the CBS label (later Sony Classical), and he made over 60 albums for them.\n\nThis proliferation proved bewildering even to Rampal himself. In his autobiography he referred to his own \"enormous discography, one that I can't even keep track of myself.\"  One collector has made an attempt.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elenayarritu.com/rampallp.html | title=Jean-Pierre Rampal LP Records Collection | publisher=Fluxure Advanced Motion Media | work=ElenaYarritu.com | last=Kedar | first=Ehud | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112040609/http://www.elenayarritu.com/rampallp.html | archivedate=12 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe [[compact disc]] set ''Jean-Pierre Rampal: Le premier virtuose moderne'',<ref>{{cite AV media | title=Le premier virtuose moderne | publisher=Patrimoine | date=2002 | people=Rampal, Jean-Pierre | medium=CD | location=France | language=French}}</ref> issued in France in 2002 in collaboration with the Association Fran\u00e7aise de la Fl\u00fbte,  contains rare early performances from 78&nbsp;rpm records made from 1946 to 1959.\n\nSince then, the Association Jean-Pierre Rampal has re-issued a number of early recordings (on the Premier Horizons label and elsewhere), including his 1954 recording of the concerto by Feld, and a range of recordings he made between 1954 and 1966 with orchestras conducted by Karl Ristenpart, with whom he enjoyed a close collaboration. These include works by Vivaldi, Bach, Handel, Tartini, Mozart, Arma, and Jolivet.\n\nIn 2015, the complete recordings made by Rampal for Erato \u2013 a label for which he recorded extensively from the early 1950s to the early 1980s \u2013 were reissued. These three volumes, comprising over 40 CDs (vo.1: 1954\u201363, vol.2: 1963\u201369, vol.3: 1970\u201382), stand alongside the complete HMV recordings (1951\u201376 on 12 CDs) also re-issued under the Erato label.\n\n== Rampal on TV and DVD ==\nRampal made a great many television concert appearances in France from the late 1950s onwards, and later elsewhere\u2014especially in America and Japan, where his reputation and following remained highest. As the first televised flute-player of any age, the medium contributed to his worldwide popularity in the decades after World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II. By comparison with the vast number of his CD and vinyl recordings in circulation, however, commercially available video and DVD footage of Rampal is relatively scarce, but collectors will be especially interested in four DVDs that contain live or recorded performances by him:\n\n;''Jean-Pierre Rampal''\n:''EMI \"Classic Archive\" DVB 51089991; released 2007 in collaboration with the Association Jean-Pierre Rampal''\n: This presents a collection of fine early performances filmed for French TV between 1958 and 1965 and still held in the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel, the national French television archive. The earliest footage was broadcast on 17 March 1958, in the musical TV series ''Les Grandes Interpr\u00e8tes'', soon after Rampal had returned from his successful debut tour of the US.\n:He begins with Handel's Sonata in F (HWV.369), then plays Debussy's ''The Little Shepherd'' and Ravel's ''Pi\u00e8ce en forme de habanera'', both transcribed for flute and piano; and also Jolivet's ''Incantation C'' for unaccompanied flute. For the Handel, Debussy, and Ravel pieces, he is accompanied by the programme's presenter, pianist [[Bernard Gavoty]]. After a performance of Vivaldi's ''La Notte'' concerto in G minor RV 439 with the Collegium Musicum de Paris (broadcast 8 October 1963) comes a rendition of J.S. Bach's Suite in C minor BWV 997 (Paris, 16 April 1963) and the opening Allegro from Bach's Sonata in G minor BWV 1020 (Paris, broadcast 28 December 1964), both with Veyron-Lacroix at the harpsichord. More of this duo in recital at the Salle Gaveau in Paris (19 March 1964) appears from the TV series the [[Jeunesses musicales de France]], featuring Couperin's Concert Royal No. 4, parts of J. S. Bach's Partita in A minor for solo flute and a sonata in B flat, K.15, by Mozart. The two concerto performances that complete the collection, both with the Orchestre Philharmonique de l'ORTF conducted by Rampal's long-time collaborator Louis de Froment, are of Mozart's Concerto No. 1 in G, K.313 (Paris, 5 May 1965), and the Ibert flute concerto (Paris, 8 April 1962). Of the Mozart concertos, Rampal said in a BBC Radio 4 interview that he did not like his 1966 recording with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra for ERATO because his playing was adversely affected by the uncomfortably high orchestral pitch insisted upon in Vienna. By contrast, he said he preferred his 1978 recording with the \u2018Israel Symphony Orchestra\u2019, even though it does not compare particularly well with the earlier TV performance.<ref name=\"bbc\"/>\n;''Francis Poulenc and Friends''\n:''EMI 'Classic Archive' DVB 3102019''\n: Rampal, playing the Poulenc flute sonata, is featured twice in this compilation, once with Poulenc himself in 1959 and again after the composer's death in 1963. The initial footage, preserved in the national French TV archive, is of a televised concert given by Poulenc in Paris at the Salle Gaveau in 1959. After a brief interview with the composer, Poulenc is joined on set by Rampal to perform the slow ''Cantilena'' from the flute Sonata. Rampal is seen again later in footage from a TV broadcast in which he plays the complete Flute Sonata, this time accompanied by  Veyron-Lacroix. Additional performances of Poulenc's music are provided by artists including pianist Jacques F\u00e9vrier, cellist Maurice Gendron, baritone Gabriel Bacquier, organist Jean-Jacques Grunenwald, soprano Denise Duval and others, together with the ORTF National Orchestra conducted by Georges Pr\u00eatre.\n;''The Art of Jean-Pierre Rampal 1956\u20131966''\n:''Video Artists International''\n: This is a two-volume DVD compilation featuring a series of Radio-Canada \"Telecasts\", broadcast and recorded during the years when Rampal was at the peak of his fame. In this rare footage, retrieved from the archives of CBC Montreal, Rampal is accompanied by Veyron-Lacroix and the McGill Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Alexander Brott. The first volume of this set of live broadcasts includes: Boccherini's Concerto for Flute and Orchestra in D major (broadcast 1 March 1956); Haydn's Concerto for flute, harpsichord and string orchestra in F major, with Debussy's ''Syrinx for unaccompanied flute'' (broadcast March 28, 1957); Couperin's Concert Royal IV, with J. S. Bach's Sonata for flute and harpsichord in G minor, BWV 1020 (broadcast 27 December 1961). Volume two features Mozart's Flute Concerto No. 2 in D major, K.314, together with the Flute Concerto No. 1 in G major, K.313 (broadcast 24 February 1966).\n;''Bolling: Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano''\n: This features a live televised performance from 1976 of Claude Bolling's cross-over ''Suite'' (1973), written for Jean-Pierre Rampal (who plays a classical line to Bolling's jazz piano) and which by then had become a runaway success in the ''Billboard'' charts. Special guest double-bass player Max Hediguer is also featured.\n\n== Radio ==\nApart from the many French Radio broadcasts of performances by Rampal, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 45-minute profile, ''Rampal\u2013\"Prince of Flute Players\"'', on 11 October 1983 in the 20:20\u201321:05 documentary slot. It contained extracts from an interview with Rampal himself, rare for the fact that Rampal gave very few interviews of any length in English. Rampal talks about his life and times and his approach to music-making. Also featured are interviews with English flautist William Bennett, American flautist and Rampal's sometimes-pupil Elena Duran, and violinist Isaac Stern\u2014who was Rampal's long-time friend and musical collaborator. The programme is kept in the [[BBC Sound Archive]], together with the two unedited original interviews with Rampal that it draws on (both recorded by Griffiths in London, in January 1981 and November 1982, at the Westbury Hotel, off Regent Street, where Rampal normally stayed).\n\n==Films==\n''L. Subramaniam: Violin From the Heart'' (1999), directed by Jean Henri Meunier, includes a scene of Rampal performing with [[L. Subramaniam]].)\n\nRampal also makes an appearance in the 1977 educational film ''The Joy of Bach'', playing his flute on a rooftop in France.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n'''Bel Canto Flute: The Rampal School''' (2003; Winzer Press) by Sheryl Cohen is a study of Rampal's methods and influence by an American flautist and teacher who studied with both Jean-Pierre Rampal and his fellow Marseille flautist [[Alain Marion]]. It is controversial to refer to the Marseilles group of flute players as a \"school\" distinct from the more widely acknowledged \"French Flute School\" in which Marcel Moyse and his predecessors Gaubert and Taffanel are central figures, but Cohen's study is an attempt to give Joseph Rampal, together with his son Jean-Pierre and others, some formal credit for an identifiable style of playing that became appreciated right around the musical world. As signature characteristics of this style, Cohen points in particular to a \"poetic approach to expressive [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] as a foundation to develop musical artistry, creative practice methods, breath control tone, articulation, and technique, all while searching to free the artist from within.\" The book, which draws on the contents of Jean-Pierre Rampal's masterclasses, includes 34 etudes, 33 solo movements and a set of daily studies used as teaching materials by both Rampal and by Marion. Sheryl Cohen, Professor Emerita of Music at the University of Alabama, has since extended her study by also running a Fellowship at the Camargo Foundation in Cassis in Provence entitled ''The Flute School of Marseille: The Rampal Lineage''. The course chronicles \"the development and influence of the school of Joseph Rampal on flute playing in the twentieth century\" in order to \"preserve the vast philosophical and pedagogical project mounted by the school, and establish Joseph Rampal's proper place in the history of the flute.\"\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://jprampal.com/ ''L'Association Jean-Pierre Rampal'']\n*[http://www.civp.com/rampal/rampalgb/arampalgb.html Jean Pierre-Rampal Flute Competition] The 8th Jean-Pierre Rampal International Flute Competition is to be held in Paris, from 23 September to 4 October 2008, as part of the Concours internationaux de la Ville de Paris.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091030133113/http://www.fanfaire.com/rampal/index.html ''Fanfaire'' tributes to Rampal]\n*[http://classicalmusicianstoza.blogspot.ca/2014/06/jean-pierre-rampal-french-flautist-and.html Some programs, introduction and photos from his 3 acclaimed tours of Southern Africa, 1959\u201373]\n*[http://pryordodge.com/JP_Rampal.html Photographs of Jean-Pierre Rampal] at the Acad\u00e9mie Internationale d'Et\u00e9 in Nice, 1968 & 1970\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100213233536/http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/photos/winigrad/rampal.html Photographs of Rampal] in rehearsal with Aaron Copland at Saratoga Springs, New York, 1979\n* [http://classicalmusicianstoza.blogspot.ca/2014/06/french-wind-quintet.html J-P Rampal touring Southern Africa with the French Wind Quintet, 1963]\n\n{{L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize laureates}}\n{{Gramophone Hall of Fame}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rampal, Jean-Pierre}}\n[[Category:People from Marseille]]\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2000 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni]]\n[[Category:French classical flautists]]\n[[Category:Academics of the Conservatoire de Paris]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize]]\n[[Category:20th-century classical musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century French musicians]]\n", "name_user": "John B123", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed cite error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Rampal"}
