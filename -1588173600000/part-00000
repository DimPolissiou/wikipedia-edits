As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

The procedure used for a given legislative proposal depends on the policy area in question. Most legislation needs to be proposed by the [[European Commission]] and approved by the [[Council of the European Union]] and [[European Parliament]] to become law.\n\nOver the years the power of the [[European Parliament]] within the legislative process has been greatly increased from being limited to giving its non-binding opinion or excluded from the legislative process altogether, to participating equally with the Council in the legislative process.\n\nThe power to amend the [[Treaties of the European Union]], sometimes referred to as the Union's primary law, or even as its ''de facto'' constitution, is reserved to the member states and must be ratified by them in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. An exception to this are so-called [[passerelle clause]]s in which the legislative procedure used for a certain policy area can be changed without formally amending the treaties.\n\n==Actors==\nSince December 2009, after the [[Lisbon Treaty]] came into force, the European Union is considered to have three legislative bodies: the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, with the national parliaments of the EU playing a further role.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2017/583133/IPOL_BRI(2017)583133_EN.pdf |work=European Parliament |title=The legisprudential role of national parliaments in the European Union|date=2017}}</ref> The precise nature of this organisation has been discussed extensively in academic literature, with some categorising the European Union as [[tricameral]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Ian|date=2013-07-01|title=Bicameral or Tricameral?

It organises itself as a normal multi-party parliament in conducting most of its work in [[Committees of the European Parliament|its committees]] and sitting in [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groupings]] rather than national delegations. However, its political groups are very weak due to their status as broad ideological groups of existing national parties.\n\nThe Parliament's powers have grown considerably since the 1950s as new legislative procedures granted more equality between Parliament and Council. It has also become a requirement that the composition of the European Commission be subject to a vote of approval as a whole by the Parliament. However, the choice of candidates remains the jurisdiction of the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission retains the sole power of legislative initiative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers|work=European Parliament|title=Legislative powers|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Library of European Parliament\">{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130619/LDM_BRI(2013)130619_REV2_EN.pdf|work=Library of the European Parliament|title=Parliament's legislative initiative|date=24 October 2013|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Council of the European Union====\n{{Main|Council of the European Union}}\n\nThe Council of the EU represents the national governments of member states, and hence its composition is essentially the number of member states (28) though votes are weighted according to the population of each state (see procedures below for clarification). As such, it does not sit according to political groups and rather than conducting most of its work in committees, much of its work is prepared by diplomatic representatives ([[COREPER]]).\n\n===Secondary actors===\n\n====National parliaments====\n{{Main|National parliaments of the European Union}}\n\nThe national parliaments of [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] have an \"early warning mechanism\" whereby if one third raise an objection \u2013 a \"yellow card\" \u2013 on the basis that the ''principle of [[subsidiarity]]'' has been violated, then the proposal must be reviewed. If a majority do so \u2013 an \"orange card\" \u2013 then the Council or Parliament can vote it down immediately. If the logistical problems of putting this into practice are overcome, then the power of the national parliaments could be decried as an extra legislature, without a common debate or physical location: dubbed by EU Observer a \"virtual third chamber\".<ref>Cooper, Ian (16 October 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28839 Comment: Will national parliaments use their new powers?], EU Observer</ref>\n\n==Ordinary legislative procedure==\n[[File:European Union legislative triangle.svg|thumb|Ordinary legislative procedure]]\nThe ordinary legislative procedure<ref name=\"Lisbon draft\">{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/cg00001re01en.pdf|title=Text of the Draft Treaty amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community|publisher=Europa (web portal)|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> is the main legislative procedure by which directives and regulations are adopted. It was formerly known as the ''codecision procedure,'' and is sometimes referred to as the ''[[community method]]'' as a contrast to the ''[[Intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental methods]]'' which can variously refer to the [[#Consultation procedure|consultation procedure]] or to the [[Open Method of Coordination|open method of co-ordination]].<ref>Craig and de B\u00farca, p 145.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/eurojargon/index_en.htm|title=Glossary of summaries \u2013 EUR-Lex|publisher=Europa (web portal)|accessdate=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029224734/http://europa.eu/abc/eurojargon/index_en.htm|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nArticle 294 TFEU<ref>Formerly Article 251 [[Treaty establishing the European Community|TEC]] pre-Lisbon Treaty</ref> outlines ordinary legislative procedure in the following manner. The Commission submits a legislative proposal to the Parliament and Council. At the first reading Parliament adopts its position. If the Council approves the Parliament's wording then the act is adopted. If not, it shall adopt its own position and pass it back to Parliament with explanations. The Commission also informs Parliament of its position on the matter. At the second reading, the act is adopted if Parliament approves the Council's text or fails to take a decision. The Parliament may reject the Council's text, leading to a failure of the law, or modify it and pass it back to the Council. The Commission gives its opinion once more. Where the Commission has rejected amendments in its opinion, the Council must act unanimously rather than by majority.<ref name=\"consolidated TFEU\">{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF|title=The requested document does not exist. \u2013 EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIf, within three months of receiving Parliament's new text, the Council approves it, then it is adopted. If it does not, the Council President, with the agreement of the Parliament President, convenes the Conciliation Committee composed of the Council and an equal number of MEPs (with the attendance as moderator of the Commission). The committee draws up a joint text on the basis of the two positions. If within six weeks it fails to agree a common text, then the act has failed. If it succeeds and the committee approves the text, then the Council and Parliament (acting by majority) must then approve said text (third reading). If either fails to do so, the act is not adopted.<ref name=\"consolidated TFEU\"/>\n\nThe procedure was introduced with the [[Maastricht Treaty]] as the codecision procedure<ref>Craig and de B\u00farca, p 144.</ref> and was initially intended to replace the Cooperation procedure (see below). The codecision procedure was amended by the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]]<ref>Article 2(44) of that treaty.</ref> and the number of legal bases where the procedure applies was greatly increased by both the latter treaty and the [[Treaty of Nice]]. It was renamed the ordinary legislative procedure and extended to nearly all areas such as [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]], [[Common Fisheries Policy|fisheries]], transport, structural funds, the [[Budget of the European Union|entire budget]] and the [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|former third pillar]] by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].<ref name=\"Lisbon draft\"/>\n\n=== Trilogue ===\n{{Main articles|Trilogue}}\nThe trilogue is an informal type of meeting used in the EU's ordinary legislative procedure. It involves representatives of the [[European Parliament]] (EP), the [[Council of the EU]] and the [[European Commission]]. The trilogues are equally tripartite meetings, although the EC operates as a mediator between the EP and the Council. \nThe trilogue negotiations aim at bringing the three institutions to an agreement, to fast-track the ordinary legislative procedure. The expression \"formal trilogue\" is sometimes used to describe meetings of the Conciliation Committee,<ref>http://www.cep.eu/Studien/cepInput_Trilog/cepInput_Legislation_by_way_of_trialogue.pdf,p.5{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> which take place between the second and the third reading of a legislative proposal. However the term trilogue is mostly referred to interinstitutional informal negotiations<ref name=\"auto\">Robert Sch\u00fctze, An Introduction to European Law, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 45</ref> that can take place in any stage of the ordinary legislative procedure, from the first stage to the stage of the formal conciliation procedure.<ref>http://www.cep.eu/Studien/cepInput_Trilog/cepInput_Legislation_by_way_of_trialogue.pdf</ref> However, the agreements reached in trilogues need to be approved through the formal procedures of each of the three institutions. Trilogues have been \"formalised\" in 2007<ref>Ulrich Karpen, Helen Xanthaki (ed.) Legislation in Europe. A Comprehensive Guide For Scholars and Practitioners, Bloomsbury, Oxford and Portland, Oregon 2017</ref> in a joint declaration of the EP, the Council and the EC<ref>Joint Declaration On Practical Arrangements For The Codecision Procedure, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32007C0630(01)</ref> but they are not regulated by primary legislation.\n\nThe evolution of the European integration process, together with the evolution of EP's role as co-legislator have produced an increase in the number of the trilogue meetings.<ref name=\"forumcostituzionale.it\">http://www.forumcostituzionale.it/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/salmaso.pdf</ref> During 2009\u20132014 legislative term, when the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] came into force and the co-decision procedure became ordinary legislative procedure \u2013 establishing the role of the EP and the Council of the EU as co-legislators \u2013 85% of legislative acts were approved in first reading, 13% were approved in second reading while only 2% were included in the conciliation procedure. This trend corresponds to an increase in the number of trilogues (over 1500 in the same period)<ref>http://www.europarl.europa.eu/the-secretary-general/resource/static/files/Documents%20section/SPforEP/Trilogue_negotiations.pdf</ref> and it is seen as a proof of the effectiveness of the trilogues in fast tracking the legislative procedure.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe principal tool used in trilogues is the four column document, a working sheet divided in four sections, each of them comprising the positions of the three EU institutions. The first column is dedicated to the position of the EC, the second one to the position of the EP, the third one to the position of the Council. The fourth and final column is left to the compromised text that is meant to emerge.  However, although the first two positions are public, the other two have often textual elements that have not been adopted and the content of the fourth column remains inaccessible to public.<ref name=\"forumcostituzionale.it\"/>\nTrilogues have been criticised for the lack of transparency and democraticness both for the limited number of EU representatives involved and the working methods.<ref>Robert Sch\u00fctze, An Introduction to European Law, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 46</ref>\nThe [[European Ombudsman]], the EU body responsible of investigating complaints about poor administration by EU institutions and other bodies, in 2015 has launched a strategic inquiry to establish the need for a reform of the trilogue, setting out proposals for more transparency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/it/cases/caseopened.faces/it/59816/html.bookmark|title=European Ombudsman|publisher=Europa (web portal)}}</ref>\n\n==Special legislative procedures==\nThe treaties have provision for special legislative procedures to be used in sensitive areas. These see the Council adopt alone with just the involvement of the other. Notable procedures are the consultation and consent procedures, though various others are used for specific cases.\n\n===Consultation procedure ===\nUnder this procedure the Council, acting either unanimously or by a qualified majority depending on the policy area concerned, can adopt legislation based on a proposal by the European Commission after consulting the European Parliament. While being required to consult Parliament on legislative proposals, the Council is not bound by Parliament's position. In practice the Council would frequently ignore whatever Parliament might suggest and even sometimes reach an agreement before receiving Parliament's opinion. However the [[European Court of Justice]] has ruled that the Council must wait for Parliament's opinion and the Court has struck down legislation that the Council adopted before Parliament gave its opinion.<ref>In ''[[Roquette Fr\u00e8res v Council]]'' <nowiki>[1980]</nowiki> ECR 3333.</ref> \n\nBefore the Single European Act the Consultation procedure was the most widely used legislative procedure in the then [[European Community]]. Consultation is still used for legislation concerning internal market exemptions and competition law.<ref name=\"EU follow\"/> The procedure is also used in relation to the Union's advisory bodies such as the [[Committee of the Regions]] and the [[Economic and Social Committee]] that are required to be consulted under a range of areas under the treaties affecting their area of expertise. Such a procedure takes place in addition to consultation with the European Parliament or the other legislative procedures.\n\n===Consent procedure===\n{{Main|Consent procedure}}\nIn the consent procedure (formerly assent procedure), the Council can adopt legislation based on a proposal by the European Commission after obtaining the consent of Parliament. Thus Parliament has the legal power to accept or reject any proposal but no legal mechanism exists for proposing amendments. Parliament has however provided for [[conciliation]] committee and a procedure for giving interim reports where it can address its concerns to the Council and threaten to withhold its consent unless its concerns are met.<ref>Craig and de B\u00farca, p 148.</ref> This applies to [[Enlargement of the European Union|admission of members]], methods of [[Withdrawal from the European Union|withdrawal]], subsidiary general legal basis provision and combating discrimination.<ref name=\"EU follow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beg.ch/ec-charts/pdf/WC_ECcharts-02a-Reform_Treaty_V18_2008-03-30.pdf|title=The EU following the LisbonTreaty (Reform Treaty)}}</ref>\n\n== Non-legislative procedures ==\n===Commission and Council acting alone===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nUnder this procedure the Council can adopt legal acts proposed by the Commission without requiring the opinion of Parliament. The procedure is used when setting the [[common external tariff]] (Article 31 (ex Article 26)) and for negotiating trade agreements under the [[EU's Common Commercial Policy]] (Article 207(3)). However, formally speaking these acts are not legislative acts.\n\n===Commission acting alone===\nIn a few limited areas, the Commission has the authority to adopt regulatory or technical legislation without consulting or obtaining the consent of other bodies. The Commission can adopt legal acts on its own initiative concerning monopolies and concessions granted to companies by Member States (Article 106(3) TFEU) and concerning the right of workers to remain in a Member State after having been employed there (Article 45(3)(d) TFEU). Two directives have been adopted using this procedure: one on transparency between member states and companies<ref>Dir. 80/723 [1980] OJ L195/35</ref> and another on competition in the telecommunications sector.<ref>Dir. 88/301 [1988] OJ L131/73</ref> Formally speaking, these acts are not legislative acts.\n\n===Treaty revisions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThe 2009 [[Lisbon Treaty]] created two different ways for further amendments of the European Union treaties: an ordinary revision procedure which is broadly similar to the past revision process in that it involves convening an intergovernmental conference, and a simplified revision procedure whereby Part three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which deals with internal policy and action of the Union, could be amended by a unanimous decision of the [[European Council]], provided there is no change to the field of competence of the EU, and subject to ratification by all member states in the usual manner.\n\nThe Treaty also provides for the [[Passerelle Clause]] which allows the European Council to unanimously decide to replace unanimous voting in the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] with [[qualified majority voting]] in specified areas with the previous consent of the European Parliament, and move from a special legislative procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure.\n\n====Ordinary revision procedure====\n# Proposals to amend the treaties are submitted by a Member State, the European Parliament or the European Commission to the Council of Ministers who, in turn, submit them to the European Council and notify member states. There are no limits on what kind of amendments can be proposed.\n# The European Council, after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission, votes to consider the proposals on the basis of a simple majority, and then either:\n#* The President of the European Council convenes a convention containing representatives of national parliaments, governments, the European Parliament and the European Commission, to further consider the proposals. In due course, the convention submits its final recommendation to the European Council.\n#* Or the European Council decides, with the agreement of the European Parliament, not to convene a convention and sets the terms of reference for the inter-governmental conference itself.\n# The President of the European Council convenes an inter-governmental conference consisting of representatives of each member-state's government. The conference drafts and finalises a treaty based on the convention's recommendation or on the European Council's terms of reference.\n# EU leaders sign the treaty.\n# All member states must then ratify the treaty \"in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements\", if it is to come into force.\n\n====Simplified revision procedure====\n# Proposals to amend Part three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are submitted by a Member State, the European Parliament or the European Commission to the Council of Ministers who, in turn, submit them to the European Council and notify member states. Proposed amendments cannot increase the competences of the Union.\n# The European Council, after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission, votes to adopt a decision amending Part three on the basis of the proposals by unanimity.\n# All member states must approve the decision \"in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements\", if it is to come into force.\n\n====The Passerelle Clause====\nThe [[Passerelle Clause]] allows for the changing of voting procedures without amending the EU treaties. Under this clause the European Council can, after receiving the consent of the European Parliament, vote unanimously to:\n\n* allow the Council of Ministers to act on the basis of qualified majority in areas where they used to have to act on the basis of unanimity, except for decisions with defence or military implications.\n* allow for legislation to be adopted on the basis of the ordinary legislative procedure where it previously was to be adopted on the basis of a special legislative procedure.\n\nA decision of the European Council to use either of these provisions can come into effect only if, six months after all national parliaments had been given notice of the decision, none objects.\n\n==Legal acts==\n{{main|Legal Acts of the European Union}}\nLegal acts resulting from these procedures can come in a number of forms. A [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]] is a law that has direct effect; for example the [[European Union roaming regulations|roaming charges regulation]] which immediately set price limits on mobile phone calls made in another EU state. A [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] needs to be transposed, within certain limits, into national law; for example the [[Copyright Duration Directive]] which was transposed in Greece as ''Law No. 2557/1997'' and Ireland as ''European Communities (Term  of protection of Copyright) Regulations, 1995''. A [[Decision (European Union)|decision]] has direct effect, but only relating to a specific person or entity, and there are also various other non-binding instruments.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cooperation procedure]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|author1 = Craig, P.|author2 = de B\u00farca, G.|year = 2003|title = EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials|edition = 3rd|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford, New York|isbn = 0-19-925608-X|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/eulaw00paul}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Voermans|first=Wim|year=2010|title=Is the European Legislator after Lisbon a real Legislature?|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/15068|journal=Legislacao|issue=50|pages=391\u2013413}}\n* [http://law.leiden.edu/organisation/publiclaw/europainstitute/staff/tobler.html Tobler, Christa]; Beglinger, Jacques (2018), ''Essential EU Law in Charts'' (4th ed.), Budapest: HVG-ORAC / E.M.Meijers Institute of Legal Studies, Leiden University. {{ISBN|978-963-258-394-5}}.

The procedure used for a given legislative proposal depends on the policy area in question. Most legislation needs to be proposed by the [[European Commission]] and approved by the [[Council of the European Union]] and [[European Parliament]] to become law.\n\nOver the years the power of the [[European Parliament]] within the legislative process has been greatly increased from being limited to giving its non-binding opinion or excluded from the legislative process altogether, to participating equally with the Council in the legislative process.\n\nThe power to amend the [[Treaties of the European Union]], sometimes referred to as the Union's primary law, or even as its ''de facto'' constitution, is reserved to the member states and must be ratified by them in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. An exception to this are so-called [[passerelle clause]]s in which the legislative procedure used for a certain policy area can be changed without formally amending the treaties.\n\n==Actors==\nSince December 2009, after the [[Lisbon Treaty]] came into force, the European Union is considered to have three legislative bodies: the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, with the national parliaments of the EU playing a further role.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2017/583133/IPOL_BRI(2017)583133_EN.pdf |work=European Parliament |title=The legisprudential role of national parliaments in the European Union|date=2017}}</ref> The precise nature of this organisation has been discussed extensively in academic literature, with some categorising the European Union as [[tricameral]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Ian|date=2013-07-01|title=Bicameral or Tricameral?

It organises itself as a normal multi-party parliament in conducting most of its work in [[Committees of the European Parliament|its committees]] and sitting in [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groupings]] rather than national delegations. However, its political groups are very weak due to their status as broad ideological groups of existing national parties.\n\nThe Parliament's powers have grown considerably since the 1950s as new legislative procedures granted more equality between Parliament and Council. It has also become a requirement that the composition of the European Commission be subject to a vote of approval as a whole by the Parliament. However, the choice of candidates remains the jurisdiction of the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission retains the sole power of legislative initiative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers|work=European Parliament|title=Legislative powers|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Library of European Parliament\">{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130619/LDM_BRI(2013)130619_REV2_EN.pdf|work=Library of the European Parliament|title=Parliament's legislative initiative|date=24 October 2013|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Council of the European Union====\n{{Main|Council of the European Union}}\n\nThe Council of the EU represents the national governments of member states, and hence its composition is essentially the number of member states (28) though votes are weighted according to the population of each state (see procedures below for clarification). As such, it does not sit according to political groups and rather than conducting most of its work in committees, much of its work is prepared by diplomatic representatives ([[COREPER]]).\n\n===Secondary actors===\n\n====National parliaments====\n{{Main|National parliaments of the European Union}}\n\nThe national parliaments of [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] have an \"early warning mechanism\" whereby if one third raise an objection \u2013 a \"yellow card\" \u2013 on the basis that the ''principle of [[subsidiarity]]'' has been violated, then the proposal must be reviewed. If a majority do so \u2013 an \"orange card\" \u2013 then the Council or Parliament can vote it down immediately. If the logistical problems of putting this into practice are overcome, then the power of the national parliaments could be decried as an extra legislature, without a common debate or physical location: dubbed by EU Observer a \"virtual third chamber\".<ref>Cooper, Ian (16 October 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28839 Comment: Will national parliaments use their new powers?], EU Observer</ref>\n\n==Ordinary legislative procedure==\n[[File:European Union legislative triangle.svg|thumb|Ordinary legislative procedure]]\nThe ordinary legislative procedure<ref name=\"Lisbon draft\">{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/cg00001re01en.pdf|title=Text of the Draft Treaty amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community|publisher=Europa (web portal)|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> is the main legislative procedure by which directives and regulations are adopted. It was formerly known as the ''codecision procedure,'' and is sometimes referred to as the ''[[community method]]'' as a contrast to the ''[[Intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental methods]]'' which can variously refer to the [[#Consultation procedure|consultation procedure]] or to the [[Open Method of Coordination|open method of co-ordination]].<ref>Craig and de B\u00farca, p 145.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/eurojargon/index_en.htm|title=Glossary of summaries \u2013 EUR-Lex|publisher=Europa (web portal)|accessdate=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029224734/http://europa.eu/abc/eurojargon/index_en.htm|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nArticle 294 TFEU<ref>Formerly Article 251 [[Treaty establishing the European Community|TEC]] pre-Lisbon Treaty</ref> outlines ordinary legislative procedure in the following manner. The Commission submits a legislative proposal to the Parliament and Council. At the first reading Parliament adopts its position. If the Council approves the Parliament's wording then the act is adopted. If not, it shall adopt its own position and pass it back to Parliament with explanations. The Commission also informs Parliament of its position on the matter. At the second reading, the act is adopted if Parliament approves the Council's text or fails to take a decision. The Parliament may reject the Council's text, leading to a failure of the law, or modify it and pass it back to the Council. The Commission gives its opinion once more. Where the Commission has rejected amendments in its opinion, the Council must act unanimously rather than by majority.<ref name=\"consolidated TFEU\">{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF|title=The requested document does not exist. \u2013 EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIf, within three months of receiving Parliament's new text, the Council approves it, then it is adopted. If it does not, the Council President, with the agreement of the Parliament President, convenes the Conciliation Committee composed of the Council and an equal number of MEPs (with the attendance as moderator of the Commission). The committee draws up a joint text on the basis of the two positions. If within six weeks it fails to agree a common text, then the act has failed. If it succeeds and the committee approves the text, then the Council and Parliament (acting by majority) must then approve said text (third reading). If either fails to do so, the act is not adopted.<ref name=\"consolidated TFEU\"/>\n\nThe procedure was introduced with the [[Maastricht Treaty]] as the codecision procedure<ref>Craig and de B\u00farca, p 144.</ref> and was initially intended to replace the Cooperation procedure (see below). The codecision procedure was amended by the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]]<ref>Article 2(44) of that treaty.</ref> and the number of legal bases where the procedure applies was greatly increased by both the latter treaty and the [[Treaty of Nice]]. It was renamed the ordinary legislative procedure and extended to nearly all areas such as [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]], [[Common Fisheries Policy|fisheries]], transport, structural funds, the [[Budget of the European Union|entire budget]] and the [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|former third pillar]] by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].<ref name=\"Lisbon draft\"/>\n\n=== Trilogue ===\n{{Main articles|Trilogue}}\nThe trilogue is an informal type of meeting used in the EU's ordinary legislative procedure. It involves representatives of the [[European Parliament]] (EP), the [[Council of the EU]] and the [[European Commission]]. The trilogues are equally tripartite meetings, although the EC operates as a mediator between the EP and the Council. \nThe trilogue negotiations aim at bringing the three institutions to an agreement, to fast-track the ordinary legislative procedure. The expression \"formal trilogue\" is sometimes used to describe meetings of the Conciliation Committee,<ref>http://www.cep.eu/Studien/cepInput_Trilog/cepInput_Legislation_by_way_of_trialogue.pdf,p.5{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> which take place between the second and the third reading of a legislative proposal. However the term trilogue is mostly referred to interinstitutional informal negotiations<ref name=\"auto\">Robert Sch\u00fctze, An Introduction to European Law, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 45</ref> that can take place in any stage of the ordinary legislative procedure, from the first stage to the stage of the formal conciliation procedure.<ref>http://www.cep.eu/Studien/cepInput_Trilog/cepInput_Legislation_by_way_of_trialogue.pdf</ref> However, the agreements reached in trilogues need to be approved through the formal procedures of each of the three institutions. Trilogues have been \"formalised\" in 2007<ref>Ulrich Karpen, Helen Xanthaki (ed.) Legislation in Europe. A Comprehensive Guide For Scholars and Practitioners, Bloomsbury, Oxford and Portland, Oregon 2017</ref> in a joint declaration of the EP, the Council and the EC<ref>Joint Declaration On Practical Arrangements For The Codecision Procedure, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32007C0630(01)</ref> but they are not regulated by primary legislation.\n\nThe evolution of the European integration process, together with the evolution of EP's role as co-legislator have produced an increase in the number of the trilogue meetings.<ref name=\"forumcostituzionale.it\">http://www.forumcostituzionale.it/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/salmaso.pdf</ref> During 2009\u20132014 legislative term, when the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] came into force and the co-decision procedure became ordinary legislative procedure \u2013 establishing the role of the EP and the Council of the EU as co-legislators \u2013 85% of legislative acts were approved in first reading, 13% were approved in second reading while only 2% were included in the conciliation procedure. This trend corresponds to an increase in the number of trilogues (over 1500 in the same period)<ref>http://www.europarl.europa.eu/the-secretary-general/resource/static/files/Documents%20section/SPforEP/Trilogue_negotiations.pdf</ref> and it is seen as a proof of the effectiveness of the trilogues in fast tracking the legislative procedure.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe principal tool used in trilogues is the four column document, a working sheet divided in four sections, each of them comprising the positions of the three EU institutions. The first column is dedicated to the position of the EC, the second one to the position of the EP, the third one to the position of the Council. The fourth and final column is left to the compromised text that is meant to emerge.  However, although the first two positions are public, the other two have often textual elements that have not been adopted and the content of the fourth column remains inaccessible to public.<ref name=\"forumcostituzionale.it\"/>\nTrilogues have been criticised for the lack of transparency and democraticness both for the limited number of EU representatives involved and the working methods.<ref>Robert Sch\u00fctze, An Introduction to European Law, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 46</ref>\nThe [[European Ombudsman]], the EU body responsible of investigating complaints about poor administration by EU institutions and other bodies, in 2015 has launched a strategic inquiry to establish the need for a reform of the trilogue, setting out proposals for more transparency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/it/cases/caseopened.faces/it/59816/html.bookmark|title=European Ombudsman|publisher=Europa (web portal)}}</ref>\n\n==Special legislative procedures==\nThe treaties have provision for special legislative procedures to be used in sensitive areas. These see the Council adopt alone with just the involvement of the other. Notable procedures are the consultation and consent procedures, though various others are used for specific cases.\n\n===Consultation procedure ===\nUnder this procedure the Council, acting either unanimously or by a qualified majority depending on the policy area concerned, can adopt legislation based on a proposal by the European Commission after consulting the European Parliament. While being required to consult Parliament on legislative proposals, the Council is not bound by Parliament's position. In practice the Council would frequently ignore whatever Parliament might suggest and even sometimes reach an agreement before receiving Parliament's opinion. However the [[European Court of Justice]] has ruled that the Council must wait for Parliament's opinion and the Court has struck down legislation that the Council adopted before Parliament gave its opinion.<ref>In ''[[Roquette Fr\u00e8res v Council]]'' <nowiki>[1980]</nowiki> ECR 3333.</ref> \n\nBefore the Single European Act the Consultation procedure was the most widely used legislative procedure in the then [[European Community]]. Consultation is still used for legislation concerning internal market exemptions and competition law.<ref name=\"EU follow\"/> The procedure is also used in relation to the Union's advisory bodies such as the [[Committee of the Regions]] and the [[Economic and Social Committee]] that are required to be consulted under a range of areas under the treaties affecting their area of expertise. Such a procedure takes place in addition to consultation with the European Parliament or the other legislative procedures.\n\n===Consent procedure===\n{{Main|Consent procedure}}\nIn the consent procedure (formerly assent procedure), the Council can adopt legislation based on a proposal by the European Commission after obtaining the consent of Parliament. Thus Parliament has the legal power to accept or reject any proposal but no legal mechanism exists for proposing amendments. Parliament has however provided for [[conciliation]] committee and a procedure for giving interim reports where it can address its concerns to the Council and threaten to withhold its consent unless its concerns are met.<ref>Craig and de B\u00farca, p 148.</ref> This applies to [[Enlargement of the European Union|admission of members]], methods of [[Withdrawal from the European Union|withdrawal]], subsidiary general legal basis provision and combating discrimination.<ref name=\"EU follow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beg.ch/ec-charts/pdf/WC_ECcharts-02a-Reform_Treaty_V18_2008-03-30.pdf|title=The EU following the LisbonTreaty (Reform Treaty)}}</ref>\n\n== Non-legislative procedures ==\n===Commission and Council acting alone===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nUnder this procedure the Council can adopt legal acts proposed by the Commission without requiring the opinion of Parliament. The procedure is used when setting the [[common external tariff]] (Article 31 (ex Article 26)) and for negotiating trade agreements under the [[EU's Common Commercial Policy]] (Article 207(3)). However, formally speaking these acts are not legislative acts.\n\n===Commission acting alone===\nIn a few limited areas, the Commission has the authority to adopt regulatory or technical legislation without consulting or obtaining the consent of other bodies. The Commission can adopt legal acts on its own initiative concerning monopolies and concessions granted to companies by Member States (Article 106(3) TFEU) and concerning the right of workers to remain in a Member State after having been employed there (Article 45(3)(d) TFEU). Two directives have been adopted using this procedure: one on transparency between member states and companies<ref>Dir. 80/723 [1980] OJ L195/35</ref> and another on competition in the telecommunications sector.<ref>Dir. 88/301 [1988] OJ L131/73</ref> Formally speaking, these acts are not legislative acts.\n\n===Treaty revisions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThe 2009 [[Lisbon Treaty]] created two different ways for further amendments of the European Union treaties: an ordinary revision procedure which is broadly similar to the past revision process in that it involves convening an intergovernmental conference, and a simplified revision procedure whereby Part three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which deals with internal policy and action of the Union, could be amended by a unanimous decision of the [[European Council]], provided there is no change to the field of competence of the EU, and subject to ratification by all member states in the usual manner.\n\nThe Treaty also provides for the [[Passerelle Clause]] which allows the European Council to unanimously decide to replace unanimous voting in the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] with [[qualified majority voting]] in specified areas with the previous consent of the European Parliament, and move from a special legislative procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure.\n\n====Ordinary revision procedure====\n# Proposals to amend the treaties are submitted by a Member State, the European Parliament or the European Commission to the Council of Ministers who, in turn, submit them to the European Council and notify member states. There are no limits on what kind of amendments can be proposed.\n# The European Council, after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission, votes to consider the proposals on the basis of a simple majority, and then either:\n#* The President of the European Council convenes a convention containing representatives of national parliaments, governments, the European Parliament and the European Commission, to further consider the proposals. In due course, the convention submits its final recommendation to the European Council.\n#* Or the European Council decides, with the agreement of the European Parliament, not to convene a convention and sets the terms of reference for the inter-governmental conference itself.\n# The President of the European Council convenes an inter-governmental conference consisting of representatives of each member-state's government. The conference drafts and finalises a treaty based on the convention's recommendation or on the European Council's terms of reference.\n# EU leaders sign the treaty.\n# All member states must then ratify the treaty \"in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements\", if it is to come into force.\n\n====Simplified revision procedure====\n# Proposals to amend Part three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are submitted by a Member State, the European Parliament or the European Commission to the Council of Ministers who, in turn, submit them to the European Council and notify member states. Proposed amendments cannot increase the competences of the Union.\n# The European Council, after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission, votes to adopt a decision amending Part three on the basis of the proposals by unanimity.\n# All member states must approve the decision \"in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements\", if it is to come into force.\n\n====The Passerelle Clause====\nThe [[Passerelle Clause]] allows for the changing of voting procedures without amending the EU treaties. Under this clause the European Council can, after receiving the consent of the European Parliament, vote unanimously to:\n\n* allow the Council of Ministers to act on the basis of qualified majority in areas where they used to have to act on the basis of unanimity, except for decisions with defence or military implications.\n* allow for legislation to be adopted on the basis of the ordinary legislative procedure where it previously was to be adopted on the basis of a special legislative procedure.\n\nA decision of the European Council to use either of these provisions can come into effect only if, six months after all national parliaments had been given notice of the decision, none objects.\n\n==Legal acts==\n{{main|Legal Acts of the European Union}}\nLegal acts resulting from these procedures can come in a number of forms. A [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]] is a law that has direct effect; for example the [[European Union roaming regulations|roaming charges regulation]] which immediately set price limits on mobile phone calls made in another EU state. A [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] needs to be transposed, within certain limits, into national law; for example the [[Copyright Duration Directive]] which was transposed in Greece as ''Law No. 2557/1997'' and Ireland as ''European Communities (Term  of protection of Copyright) Regulations, 1995''. A [[Decision (European Union)|decision]] has direct effect, but only relating to a specific person or entity, and there are also various other non-binding instruments.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cooperation procedure]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|author1 = Craig, P.|author2 = de B\u00farca, G.|year = 2003|title = EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials|edition = 3rd|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford, New York|isbn = 0-19-925608-X|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/eulaw00paul}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Voermans|first=Wim|year=2010|title=Is the European Legislator after Lisbon a real Legislature?|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/15068|journal=Legislacao|issue=50|pages=391\u2013413}}\n* [http://law.leiden.edu/organisation/publiclaw/europainstitute/staff/tobler.html Tobler, Christa]; Beglinger, Jacques (2018), ''Essential EU Law in Charts'' (4th ed.), Budapest: HVG-ORAC / E.M.Meijers Institute of Legal Studies, Leiden University. {{ISBN|978-963-258-394-5}}.

The U.S. declared war and historians have long debated the multiple factors behind that decision.<ref>Jasper M. Trautsch, \"The Causes of the War of 1812: 200 Years of Debate,\" ''Journal of Military History'' (Jan 2013) 77#1 pp. 273-293.</ref>\n\nThere were several  causes for the [[United States declaration of war upon the United Kingdom|U.S. declaration of war]]: First, a series of trade restrictions introduced by Britain to impede American trade with [[First French Empire|France]], a country with which Britain was at war (the U.S. contested these restrictions as illegal under international law);<ref name=\"Caffery, pp.56-58\">Caffery, pp. 56\u201358</ref> second, the [[impressment]] (forced recruitment) of seamen on U.S. vessels into the [[Royal Navy]] (the British claimed they were British deserters); third, the British military support for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] who were offering armed resistance to the expansion of the American frontier to the Northwest; fourth, a possible desire on the part of the United States to annex Canada.<ref name=\"Caffery, pp.101-104\">Caffery, pp. 101\u2013104</ref> An implicit but powerful motivation for the Americans was the desire to uphold national honor in the face of what they considered to be British insults (such as [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard Affair|the ''Chesapeake'' affair]]).<ref name=\"in JSTOR\">Norman K.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918543 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAmerican expansion into the Northwest (Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin) was impeded by Indian raids. Some historians maintain that an American goal in the war was annex some or all of Canada, a view that many Canadians still share, while others argue that inducing the fear of such a seizure had merely been a U.S. tactic designed to obtain a bargaining chip.<ref name=\"Bowler, pp. 11-32\">Bowler, pp. 11\u201332</ref>  Some members of the British Parliament at the time<ref name=\"Canning\">[[George Canning]],  [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1813/feb/18/address-respecting-the-war-with-america#S1V0024P0_18130218_HOC_15  Address respecting the war with America], ''[[Hansard]]'' (House of Commons), 18 February 1813</ref> and dissident American politicians such as [[John Randolph of Roanoke]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Fregosi|first=Paul|title=Dreams of Empire|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1989|isbn=0-09-173926-8|page=328}}</ref> claimed that land hunger rather than maritime disputes was the main motivation for the American declaration. However, some historians, both Canadian and American, retain the view that desire to annex all or part of Canada was an American goal.<ref>J. C. A. Stagg (1983), Mr Madison's War, p. 4</ref> Although the British made some concessions before the war on neutral trade, they insisted on the right to reclaim their deserting sailors.  The British also had the long-standing goal of creating a large \"neutral\" Indian state that would cover much of Ohio, Indiana and Michigan. They made the demand as late as 1814 at the peace conference, but lost battles that would have validated their claims.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dwight L. Smith, \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 1989 61(2\u20134): 46\u201363</ref><ref>Francis M.

During the course of the war, both the Americans and British launched invasions of each other's territory, all of which were unsuccessful or gained only temporary success. At the end of the war, the British held parts of [[Battle of Hampden|Maine]] and some outposts in the sparsely populated West while the Americans held Canadian territory near Detroit, but these occupied territories were restored at the end of the war.\n\nIn the United States, battles such as [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]] (the latter of which inspired the lyrics of the U.S. national anthem, [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]) produced a sense of euphoria over a \"second war of independence\" against Britain. It ushered in an \"[[Era of Good Feelings]]\", in which the partisan animosity that had once verged on treason practically vanished. Canada also emerged from the war with a heightened sense of national feeling and solidarity. Britain, which had regarded the war as a sideshow to the [[Napoleonic Wars]] raging in Europe, was less affected by the fighting; its government and people subsequently welcomed an era of peaceful relations with the United States.\n\n==British goals==\nThe British were engaged in a  life-and-death war with [[Napoleon]] and could not allow the Americans to help the enemy, regardless of their lawful neutral rights to do so. As Horsman explains, \"If possible, England wished to avoid war with America, but not to the extent of allowing her to hinder the British war effort against France. Moreover...a large section of influential British opinion, both in the government and in the country, thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy.\" <ref>Horsman (1962) p. 264</ref> ANYONE CAN EDIT THIS WEBSITE SO NOT EVERYTHING ON HERE IS TRUE!!!(-L.S.)\n\n===Defeating Napoleon===\nThe British had two goals: All parties were committed to the defeat of France, and this required sailors (hence the need for impressment), and it required all-out commercial war against France (hence the restrictions imposed on American merchant ships). On the question of trade with America the British parties split. As Horsman argues, \"Some restrictions on neutral commerce were essential for England in this period. That this restriction took such an extreme form after 1807 stemmed not only from the effort to defeat Napoleon, but also from the undoubted jealousy of America's commercial prosperity that existed in England. America was unfortunate in that for most of the period from 1803 to 1812 political power in England was held by a group that was pledged not only to the defeat of France, but also to a rigid maintenance of Britain's commercial supremacy.\"<ref name=\"Horsman 1962 p. 265\">Horsman (1962) p. 265</ref> That group was weakened by Whigs friendly to the U.S. in mid-1812 and the policies were reversed, but too late for the U.S. had already declared war. By 1815 Britain was no longer controlled by politicians dedicated to commercial supremacy, so that cause had vanished.\n\nThe British were hindered by weakened diplomats in Washington (such as [[David Erskine, 2nd Baron Erskine|David Erskine]]) who were unable to represent consistent British policy and by communications that were so slow the Americans did not learn of the reversal of policy until they had declared war.\n\nWhen Americans proposed a truce based on British ending impressment, Britain refused, because it needed those sailors. Horsman explains, \"Impressment, which was the main point of contention between England and America from 1803 to 1807, was made necessary primarily because of England's great shortage of seamen for the war against Napoleon. In a similar manner the restrictions on American commerce imposed by England's Orders in Council, which were the supreme cause of complaint between 1807 and 1812, were one part of a vast commercial struggle being waged between England and France.\" <ref name=\"Horsman 1962 p. 265\"/>\n\n===Creating an Indian barrier state between U.S. and Canada===\nThe British also had the long-standing goal of creating an [[Indian barrier state]], a large \"neutral\" Indian state that would cover most of the [[Old Northwest]] and be a barrier between the western parts of the United States and Canada. It would be independent of the United States and under the tutelage of the British, who would use it to block American expansion and to build up their control of the fur trade.<ref>Dwight L. Smith\"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2-4 (1989): 46-63.</ref>  They made the demand as late as 1814 at the peace conference, but dropped the demand. Their position had been weakened by the collapse of [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]] after the [[Battle of the Thames]], but the British also simply no longer considered the goal worth conflict with the United States. Much of the proposed buffer state remained largely under British and Indian control throughout the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Francis M.

First, a series of trade restrictions called the Orders in Council (1807) introduced by Britain to impede American trade with [[First French Empire|France]], a country with which Britain was at war; the U.S. contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.<ref name=\"Caffery, pp.56-58\"/> Second, the [[impressment]] (forced recruitment) of U.S. citizens into the [[Royal Navy]]. Third, the alleged British military support for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] who were offering armed resistance to the United States.<ref name=\"Caffery, pp.101-104\"/>  An unstated but powerful motivation for the Americans was the need to uphold national honor in the face of British insults (such as the ''Chesapeake'' affair.)<ref name=\"in JSTOR\"/> There also may have been an American desire to annex      Canada.\n\n===British support for Indian raids===\nIndians based in the [[Northwest Territory]], comprising the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, had organized in opposition to American settlement, and were being supplied with weapons by British traders in Canada.  Britain was not trying to provoke a war, and at one point cut its allocations of gunpowder to the tribes, but it was trying to build up its fur trade and friendly relations with potential military allies.<ref>Mark Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake: The War of 1812 and the Brokering of an Uneasy Peace'' (2006) pp 62\u201362</ref> Although Britain had ceded the area to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, it had the long-term goal of creating a \"neutral\" or buffer Indian state in the area that would block further American growth.<ref>Dwight L. Smith, \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea\", ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly''  (1989) 61 (2\u20134): 46\u201363.</ref>  The Indian nations generally followed [[Tenskwatawa]] (the Shawnee Prophet and the brother of [[Tecumseh]]), who since 1805 had preached his vision of purifying his society by expelling the \"Children of the Evil Spirit\" (the American settlers).<ref>Timothy D. Willig. ''Restoring the Chain of Friendship: British Policy and the Indians of the Great Lakes, 1783\u20131815'' (2008) p. 207.</ref>\n\nPratt says:\n\n<blockquote>There is ample proof that the British authorities did all in their power to hold or win the allegiance of the Indians of the Northwest with the expectation of using them as allies in the event of war. Indian allegiance could be held only by gifts, and to an Indian no gift was as acceptable as a lethal weapon. Guns and ammunition, tomahawks and scalping knives were dealt out with some liberality by British agents.<ref>Julius W. Pratt, ''A history of United States foreign-policy'' (1955) p 126</ref>\nRaiding grew more common in 1810 and 1811; Westerners in Congress found the raids intolerable and wanted them permanently ended.<ref>David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, eds. ''Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'' (1997) pp. 253, 504</ref><ref>Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake,'' p 62</ref></blockquote>\n\n===American expansionism===\nHistorians have considered the idea that American expansionism was one cause of the war. The American expansion into the Northwest\u2014Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin\u2014was being blocked by Indians and that was a major cause animating the Westerners.  American historian Walter Nugent in his history of  American expansionism argues that expansion into the Midwest \"was not the only American objective, and indeed not the immediate one area but it was an objective.\"<ref>Walter Nugent, ''Habits of Empire: A History of American Expansionism'' (2009) ch 3, quoted on page 73.</ref>\n\n==== Annexation====\nMore controversial is whether an American war goal was to permanently acquire Canadian lands (especially western Ontario), or whether it was planned to seize the area temporarily, as a bargaining chip. The American desire for Canadian land has been a staple in Canadian public opinion since the 1830s, and was much discussed among historians before 1940, but has become less popular since then. The idea was first developed by Marxist historian [[Louis M. Hacker]] and refined by diplomatic specialist Julius Pratt.<ref>Hacker (1924); Pratt (1925). Goodman (1941) refuted the idea and even Pratt gave it up. Pratt (1955)</ref> \nIn 1925, Pratt argued that Western Americans were incited to war by the prospect of seizing Canada.<ref>Julius W. Pratt,  \"Western Aims in the War of 1812.\" ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1925): 36-50. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1891784 in JSTOR]</ref>  Pratt's argument supported the belief of many Canadians, especially in Ontario, where fear of American expansionism was a major political element. To this day the notion still survives among Canadians.<ref>W. Arthur Bowler, \"Propaganda in Upper Canada in the War of 1812,\" ''American Review of Canadian Studies'' (1988) 28:11\u201332; C.P. Stacey, \"The War of 1812 in Canadian History\" in Morris Zaslow and Wesley B. Turner, eds. ''The Defended Border: Upper Canada and the War of 1812'' (Toronto, 1964)</ref> \n[[File:United States 1812-05-1812-06.png|left|thumb]]\n\nIn 2010 American historian [[Alan Taylor (historian)|Alan Taylor]] examined the political dimension of the annexation issue as Congress debated whether to declare war in 1811-12. The [[Federalist party]] was strongly opposed to war and to annexation, as were the northeastern states. The majority in Congress was held by the Jeffersonian Republican party, which split on the issue. One faction wanted to permanently expel Britain and annex Canada.  [[John Randolph of Roanoke]], representing Virginia, commented, \"Agrarian greed not maritime right urges this war. We have heard but one word - like the whipporwill's one monotonous tone: Canada! Canada! Canada!\"{{sfn|Fregosi|1989|p=328}}The other faction,  based in the South, said that acquiring new territory in the north would give the northern states too much power, and opposed the incorporation into Canada of a Catholic population which it viewed as \"unfit by faith, language and illiteracy for republican citizenship.\"  The Senate held a series of debates, and twice voted on proposals to explicitly endorse annexation, neither of which passed, although the second one only failed because of a proviso stating that Canada could be returned to British rule after being annexed. War was declared with no mention of annexation although widespread support existed among the War Hawks for it. Some Southerners supported expansionism; Tennessee Senator [[Felix Grundy]] considered it essential to acquire Canada to ''preserve'' domestic political balance, arguing that annexing Canada would maintain the free state-slave state balance, which might otherwise be thrown off by the acquisition of Florida and the settlement of the southern areas of the new [[Louisiana Purchase]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Roderick Heller|title=Democracy's Lawyer: Felix Grundy of the Old Southwest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8mM8D9RVu4C&pg=PA98|year=2010|page=98}}</ref>\n\nEven [[James Monroe]] and [[Henry Clay]], key officials in the government, expected to gain at least Upper Canada from a successful war. American commanders like General William Hull and Alexander Smythe issued proclamations to Canadians and their troops assuring them that annexations would in fact occur during the war. Smythe wrote to his troops that when they entered Canada \"You enter a country that is to become one with the United States. You will arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens.\"  <ref>Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, & Indian Allies'' (2010) pp 137-40.</ref>\n\n====Seizing Canada as a bargaining chip====\nToday historians generally agree that an invasion and temporary seizure of Canada was the central American military strategy once the war began.  Given British control of the oceans, there was no other way to actively fight against British interests. President Madison believed that food supplies from Canada were essential to the British overseas empire in the West Indies, and that an American seizure would be an excellent bargaining chip at the peace conference. During the war, some Americans speculated that they might as well keep all of Canada. Thomas Jefferson, for example, although now out of power, argued that expulsion of British interests from nearby Canada would remove a long-term threat to American republicanism. New Zealand historian J.G.A. Stagg argues that Madison and his advisers believed that conquest of Canada would be easy and that economic coercion would force the British to come to terms by cutting off the food supply for their highly valuable West Indies sugar colonies. Furthermore, possession of Canada would be a valuable bargaining chip. Stagg suggests frontiersmen demanded the seizure of Canada not because they wanted the land (they had plenty), but because the British were thought to be arming the Indians and thereby blocking settlement of the west.<ref>Stagg (1983)</ref> As Horsman concludes, \"The idea of conquering Canada had been present since at least 1807 as a means of forcing England to change her policy at sea. The conquest of Canada was primarily a means of waging war, not a reason for starting it.\"<ref>Horsman (1962) p. 267</ref> Hickey flatly states, \"The desire to annex Canada did not bring on the war.\" <ref>Hickey (1990) p. 72.</ref> Brown (1964) concludes, \"The purpose of the Canadian expedition was to serve negotiation not to annex Canada.\"<ref>Brown p. 128.</ref> Burt, a Canadian scholar, but also a professor at an American university, agrees completely, noting that Foster, the British minister to Washington, also rejected the argument that annexation of Canada was a war goal.<ref>Burt (1940) pp 305\u201310.</ref> However, Foster also rejected the possibility of a declaration of war, despite having dinner with several of the more prominent War Hawks, so his judgement in these matters can be questioned.\n\nHowever,  historian J. C. A. Stagg states that, \"... had the War 1812 been a successful military venture, the Madison administration would have been reluctant to have returned occupied Canadian territory to the enemy.\"{{sfn| Stagg| 1983| p=4}} Other authors concur, one stating, \"Expansion was not the only American objective, and indeed not the immediate one.

The Loyalists were extremely hostile to union with the U.S., while the other settlers seem to have been uninterested and remained neutral during the war. The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army, and some Americans believed that the many in Upper Canada would rise up and greet an American invading army as liberators.<ref>Fred Landon, ''Western Ontario and the American Frontier'' (1941) pp 12\u201322</ref> The combination implied an easy conquest. Once the war began retired president [[Thomas Jefferson]] warned that the British presence posed a grave threat, pointing to \"The infamous intrigues of Great Britain to destroy our government....and with the Indians to Tomahawk our women and children, prove that the cession of Canada, their fulcrum for these Machiavellian levers, must be a ''sine qua non'' at a treaty of peace. Jefferson predicted in late 1812, \"the acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=James Laxer|title=Tecumseh and Brock: The War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQb5JI-G9bwC&pg=PA129|year=2012|page=129}}</ref>\n\nMaass argued in 2015 that the expansionist theme is a myth that goes against the \"relative consensus among experts that the primary U.S. objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions. He argues that consensus among scholars is that The United States went to war \"because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table, and threatening the Royal Navy's Canadian supply base was their last hope.\" However, he also notes that many historians continue to publish in support of expansionism as a cause, and that even those opposed to the idea continue to include caveats regarding \"possible expansionism underlying US motives\". Maass agrees that theoretically expansionism might have tempted Americans, but finds that \"leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so. Notably, what limited expansionism there was focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements [of Canada].\" <ref>Richard W. Maass, \"Difficult to Relinquish Territory Which Had Been Conquered\": Expansionism and the War of 1812,\" ''Diplomatic History'' (Jan 2015) 39#1 pp 70-97 doi: 10.1093/dh/dht132 [http://dh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/01/06/dh.dht132.short Abstract Online]</ref>\n\n==Violations of American rights==\nThe long wars between Britain and France (1793\u20131815) led to repeated complaints by the U.S. that both powers violated America's right as a neutral to trade with both sides. Furthermore, Americans complained loudly that British agents in Canada were supplying munitions to hostile [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes living in [[Territorial evolution of the United States|United States territory]].\n\nStarting in the mid-1790s the [[Royal Navy]], short of manpower, began boarding American merchant ships in order to seize American and British sailors from American vessels. Although this policy of [[impressment]] was supposed to reclaim only British subjects, the law of Britain and most countries defined nationality by birth whereas the United States allowed individuals who had been resident in America for some time to adopt American citizenship. There were, therefore, large numbers of individuals who were British by British law but American by American law. The confusion was compounded by the refusal of Jefferson and Madison to issue any official citizenship documents: their position was that all persons serving on American ships were to be regarded as US citizens and that no further evidence was required. This stance was motivated by the advice of [[Albert Gallatin]], who had calculated that half of American deep-sea merchant seamen - 9,000 men - were British subjects. Allowing the Royal Navy to reclaim these men would destroy both the US economy and the vital customs revenue of the government.<ref>Rodger, Command of the Ocean, p565</ref> Any sort of accommodation would jeopardize these men, and so concords such as the proposed [[Monroe-Pinkney Treaty]] (1806) between the U.S. and Britain were rejected by Jefferson.\n\nTo fill the need for some sort of identification, US consuls provided unofficial papers. However, these relied on unverifiable declarations by the individual concerned for evidence of citizenship, and the large fees paid for the documents made them a lucrative sideline. In turn, British officers- short of personnel and convinced, not entirely unreasonably, that the US flag covered a large number of British deserters- tended to treat such papers with scorn. Between 1806 and 1812 about 6,000 seamen were impressed and taken against their will into the Royal Navy<ref>Hickey (1989) p. 11</ref> of which 3,800 were subsequently released.<ref>Rodger, Command of the Ocean, p566</ref>\n\n==Honor==\nHistorian Norman Risjord has emphasized the central importance of honor as a cause the war.<ref>Norman K. Risjord, \"1812: Conservatives, War Hawks and the Nation's Honor.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly: A Magazine of Early American History'' (1961): 196-210. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918543 in JSTOR]</ref>  Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honor, and to reject  the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response.<ref>Robert L. Ivie, \"The metaphor of force in prowar discourse: The case of 1812.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 68#3 (1982) pp: 240-253.</ref> This quest for honor was a major cause of the war in the sense that most Americans who were not involved in mercantile interests or threatened by Indian attack strongly endorsed the preservation of national honor.<ref>Bradford Perkins, ''The causes of the War of 1812: National honor or national interest?'' (1962).</ref> [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard Affair|The humiliating attack]] by HMS ''Leopard'' against USS ''Chesapeake'' in June 1807 was a decisive event.<ref>Spencer Tucker and Frank T. Reuter, ''Injured Honor: The Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, June 22, 1807'' (Naval Institute Press, 1996)</ref> Many Americans called for war, but Jefferson held back, insisting that economic warfare would prove more successful.  Jefferson initiated economic warfare, especially in the form of embargoing or refusing to sell products to Britain.  It proved a failure, that did not deter the British but it seriously damaged American industry had alienated the mercantile cities of the Northeast that were so seriously hurt.  Historians have demonstrated the motive power of honor in shaping public opinion in a number of states, including Massachusetts,<ref>William Barlow and David O. Powell. \"Congressman Ezekiel Bacon of Massachusetts and the Coming of the War of 1812.\" ''Historical Journal of Massachusetts'' 6#2 (1978): 28.</ref> Ohio,<ref>William R.

Calhoun]] called for a declaration of war in ringing phrases, denouncing Britain's \"lust for power,\" \"unbounded tyranny,\" and \"mad ambition.\" James Roark says, \"These were fighting words in a war that was in large measure about insult and honor.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=James L.

Historian Lance Banning says: \n:National honor, the reputation of republican government, and the continuing supremacy of the Republican party had seemed to be at stake.... National honor had [now] been satisfied....Americans celebrated the end of the struggle with a brilliant burst of national pride.  They felt that they had fought a second war for independence, and had won. If little had been gained, nothing had been lost in a contest the greatest imperial power on the earth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lance Banning|title=The Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YL-HcJj1MO0C&pg=PA295|year=1980|publisher=Cornell UP|page=295}}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear whether the British acknowledged American honor, because when peace was signed, impressment remained legal. Nevertheless, the practice ended because the Napoleonic wars had ended and the Royal Navy no longer required as many men.\n\n==American economic motivations==\nThe failure of Jefferson's embargo and Madison's economic coercion, according to Horsman, \"made war or absolute submission to England the only alternatives, and the latter presented more terrors to the recent colonists. The war hawks came from the West and the South, regions that had supported economic warfare and were suffering the most from British restrictions at sea. The merchants of New England earned large profits from the wartime carrying trade, in spite of the numerous captures by both France and England, but the western and southern farmers, who looked longingly at the export market, were suffering a depression that made them demand war\".<ref>Horsman (1962) p. 266</ref>\n\n==Incidents leading up to the war==\nThis dispute came to the forefront with the [[Chesapeake-Leopard Affair]] of 1807, when the British warship HMS ''Leopard'' fired on and boarded the American warship USS ''Chesapeake'', killing three and carrying off four deserters from the [[Royal Navy]]. (Only one was a British citizen and he was subsequently hanged; the other three were American citizens and were later returned, though the last two not until 1812.) The American public was outraged by the incident, and many called for war in order to assert American sovereignty and national honor.\n\nThe Chesapeake-Leopard Affair followed closely on the similar [[HMS Leander (1780)#The Leander Affair|''Leander'' Affair]], which had resulted in President Jefferson banning certain British warships and their captains from American ports and waters. Whether in response to this incident or the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, President Jefferson banned all foreign armed vessels from American waters, except those bearing dispatches. In December 1808, an American officer expelled the schooner [[HMS Pitt (1805)|HMS ''Sandwich'']] from Savannah, Georgia, after she had entered with dispatches for the British Consul there.\n\nMeanwhile, Napoleon's [[Continental System]] (beginning 1806) and the British [[Orders in Council (1807)]] established embargoes that made international trade precarious. From 1807 to 1812, about 900 American ships were seized as a result.<ref>Hickey (1989) p. 19</ref> The U.S. responded with the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], which prohibited American ships from sailing to any foreign ports and closed American ports to British ships. Jefferson's embargo was especially unpopular in [[New England]], where merchants preferred the indignities of impressment to the halting of overseas commerce. This discontent contributed to the calling of the [[Hartford Convention]] in 1814.\n\nThe Embargo Act had no effect on Great Britain and France and was replaced by the [[Non-Intercourse Act|Non-Intercourse Act of 1809]], which lifted all embargoes on American shipping except for those bound for British or French ports. As this proved to be unenforceable, the Non-Intercourse Act was replaced in 1810 by [[Macon's Bill Number 2]]. This lifted all embargoes but offered that if either France or Great Britain were to cease their interference with American shipping, the United States would reinstate an embargo on the other nation. Napoleon, seeing an opportunity to make trouble for Great Britain, promised to leave American ships alone, and the United States reinstated the embargo with Great Britain and moved closer to declaring war.<ref>Napoleon had no intention of honouring promise: Hickey, p. 22; Horsman, p. 188.</ref>\n\nExacerbating the situation, [[Sauk people|Sauk]] Indians who controlled trade on the Upper Mississippi were displeased with the U.S. Government after the 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]]. This treaty ceded Sauk territory in Illinois and Missouri to the U.S.; the Sauk felt this treaty was unjust, that Quashquame was unauthorized to sign away land, and that he was unaware of what he was signing. The establishment of [[Fort Madison]] in 1808 on the Mississippi further aggravated the Sauk, and led many, including [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], to side with the British before the war broke out. Sauk and allied Indians, including the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago), were very effective fighters for the British on the Mississippi, helping to defeat Fort Madison and Fort McKay in [[Prairie du Chien]].\n\nOxford historian Paul Langford looks at the decisions by the British government in 1812: \n:The British ambassador in Washington [Erskine] brought affairs almost to an accommodation, and was ultimately disappointed not by American intransigence but by one of the outstanding diplomatic blunders made by a Foreign Secretary. It was [[George Canning|Canning]] who, in his most irresponsible manner and apparently out of sheer dislike of everything American, recalled the ambassador [[David Erskine, 2nd Baron Erskine|Erskine]] and wrecked the negotiations, a piece of most gratuitous folly. As a result, the possibility of a new embarrassment for Napoleon turned into the certainty of a much more serious one for his enemy. Though the British cabinet eventually made the necessary concessions on the score of the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders-in-Council]], in response to the pressures of industrial lobbying at home, its action came too late\u2026. The loss of the North American markets could have been a decisive blow. As it was by the time the United States declared war, the [[Continental System]] [of Napoleon] was beginning to crack, and the danger correspondingly diminishing.  Even so, the war, inconclusive though it proved in a military sense, was an irksome and expensive embarrassment which British statesman could have done much more to avert.<ref>Paul Langford, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The Eighteenth Century: 1688-1815'' (1976) p 228</ref>\n\n==Declaration of war==\nIn the [[United States House of Representatives]], a group of young [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republicans]] known as the \"[[War Hawk]]s\" came to the forefront in 1811, led by [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]] and [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]]. The War Hawks advocated going to war against Great Britain for all of the reasons listed above, though concentrating on the grievances more than the territorial expansion.\n\nOn the first of June 1812, President [[James Madison]] gave a speech to the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], recounting American grievances against Great Britain, though not specifically calling for a declaration of war. After Madison's speech, the House of Representatives quickly voted (79 to 49) to declare war, and the Senate by 19 to 13. The conflict formally began on  18 June 1812 when Madison signed the measure into law. This was the first time that the United States had declared war on another nation, and the Congressional vote would prove to be the closest vote to declare war in American history. None of the 39 [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]]s in Congress voted in favor of the war; critics of war subsequently referred to it as \"Mr. Madison's War.\"\n<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj005181)) Journal of the Senate of the United States of America, 1789\u20131873]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chronology of the War of 1812]]\n* [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|Opposition to the War of 1812]]\n* [[Results of the War of 1812]]\n* [[War of 1812]]\n* [[War of 1812 bibliography]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Adams, Henry.

During the course of the war, both the Americans and British launched invasions of each other's territory, all of which were unsuccessful or gained only temporary success. At the end of the war, the British held parts of [[Battle of Hampden|Maine]] and some outposts in the sparsely populated West while the Americans held Canadian territory near Detroit, but these occupied territories were restored at the end of the war.\n\nIn the United States, battles such as [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]] (the latter of which inspired the lyrics of the U.S. national anthem, [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]) produced a sense of euphoria over a \"second war of independence\" against Britain. It ushered in an \"[[Era of Good Feelings]]\", in which the partisan animosity that had once verged on treason practically vanished. Canada also emerged from the war with a heightened sense of national feeling and solidarity. Britain, which had regarded the war as a sideshow to the [[Napoleonic Wars]] raging in Europe, was less affected by the fighting; its government and people subsequently welcomed an era of peaceful relations with the United States.\n\n==British goals==\nThe British were engaged in a  life-and-death war with [[Napoleon]] and could not allow the Americans to help the enemy, regardless of their lawful neutral rights to do so. As Horsman explains, \"If possible, England wished to avoid war with America, but not to the extent of allowing her to hinder the British war effort against France. Moreover...a large section of influential British opinion, both in the government and in the country, thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy.\" <ref>Horsman (1962) p. 264</ref>\n\n===Defeating Napoleon===\nThe British had two goals: All parties were committed to the defeat of France, and this required sailors (hence the need for impressment), and it required all-out commercial war against France (hence the restrictions imposed on American merchant ships). On the question of trade with America the British parties split. As Horsman argues, \"Some restrictions on neutral commerce were essential for England in this period. That this restriction took such an extreme form after 1807 stemmed not only from the effort to defeat Napoleon, but also from the undoubted jealousy of America's commercial prosperity that existed in England. America was unfortunate in that for most of the period from 1803 to 1812 political power in England was held by a group that was pledged not only to the defeat of France, but also to a rigid maintenance of Britain's commercial supremacy.\"<ref name=\"Horsman 1962 p. 265\">Horsman (1962) p. 265</ref> That group was weakened by Whigs friendly to the U.S. in mid-1812 and the policies were reversed, but too late for the U.S. had already declared war. By 1815 Britain was no longer controlled by politicians dedicated to commercial supremacy, so that cause had vanished.\n\nThe British were hindered by weakened diplomats in Washington (such as [[David Erskine, 2nd Baron Erskine|David Erskine]]) who were unable to represent consistent British policy and by communications that were so slow the Americans did not learn of the reversal of policy until they had declared war.\n\nWhen Americans proposed a truce based on British ending impressment, Britain refused, because it needed those sailors. Horsman explains, \"Impressment, which was the main point of contention between England and America from 1803 to 1807, was made necessary primarily because of England's great shortage of seamen for the war against Napoleon. In a similar manner the restrictions on American commerce imposed by England's Orders in Council, which were the supreme cause of complaint between 1807 and 1812, were one part of a vast commercial struggle being waged between England and France.\" <ref name=\"Horsman 1962 p. 265\"/>\n\n===Creating an Indian barrier state between U.S. and Canada===\nThe British also had the long-standing goal of creating an [[Indian barrier state]], a large \"neutral\" Indian state that would cover most of the [[Old Northwest]] and be a barrier between the western parts of the United States and Canada. It would be independent of the United States and under the tutelage of the British, who would use it to block American expansion and to build up their control of the fur trade.<ref>Dwight L. Smith\"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2-4 (1989): 46-63.</ref>  They made the demand as late as 1814 at the peace conference, but dropped the demand. Their position had been weakened by the collapse of [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]] after the [[Battle of the Thames]], but the British also simply no longer considered the goal worth conflict with the United States. Much of the proposed buffer state remained largely under British and Indian control throughout the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Francis M.

First, a series of trade restrictions called the Orders in Council (1807) introduced by Britain to impede American trade with [[First French Empire|France]], a country with which Britain was at war; the U.S. contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.<ref name=\"Caffery, pp.56-58\"/> Second, the [[impressment]] (forced recruitment) of U.S. citizens into the [[Royal Navy]]. Third, the alleged British military support for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] who were offering armed resistance to the United States.<ref name=\"Caffery, pp.101-104\"/>  An unstated but powerful motivation for the Americans was the need to uphold national honor in the face of British insults (such as the ''Chesapeake'' affair.)<ref name=\"in JSTOR\"/> There also may have been an American desire to annex      Canada.\n\n===British support for Indian raids===\nIndians based in the [[Northwest Territory]], comprising the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, had organized in opposition to American settlement, and were being supplied with weapons by British traders in Canada.  Britain was not trying to provoke a war, and at one point cut its allocations of gunpowder to the tribes, but it was trying to build up its fur trade and friendly relations with potential military allies.<ref>Mark Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake: The War of 1812 and the Brokering of an Uneasy Peace'' (2006) pp 62\u201362</ref> Although Britain had ceded the area to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, it had the long-term goal of creating a \"neutral\" or buffer Indian state in the area that would block further American growth.<ref>Dwight L. Smith, \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea\", ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly''  (1989) 61 (2\u20134): 46\u201363.</ref>  The Indian nations generally followed [[Tenskwatawa]] (the Shawnee Prophet and the brother of [[Tecumseh]]), who since 1805 had preached his vision of purifying his society by expelling the \"Children of the Evil Spirit\" (the American settlers).<ref>Timothy D. Willig. ''Restoring the Chain of Friendship: British Policy and the Indians of the Great Lakes, 1783\u20131815'' (2008) p. 207.</ref>\n\nPratt says:\n\n<blockquote>There is ample proof that the British authorities did all in their power to hold or win the allegiance of the Indians of the Northwest with the expectation of using them as allies in the event of war. Indian allegiance could be held only by gifts, and to an Indian no gift was as acceptable as a lethal weapon. Guns and ammunition, tomahawks and scalping knives were dealt out with some liberality by British agents.<ref>Julius W. Pratt, ''A history of United States foreign-policy'' (1955) p 126</ref>\nRaiding grew more common in 1810 and 1811; Westerners in Congress found the raids intolerable and wanted them permanently ended.<ref>David S.

''Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'' (1997) pp. 253, 504</ref><ref>Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake,'' p 62</ref></blockquote>\n\n===American expansionism===\nHistorians have considered the idea that American expansionism was one cause of the war. The American expansion into the Northwest\u2014Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin\u2014was being blocked by Indians and that was a major cause animating the Westerners.  American historian Walter Nugent in his history of  American expansionism argues that expansion into the Midwest \"was not the only American objective, and indeed not the immediate one area but it was an objective.\"<ref>Walter Nugent, ''Habits of Empire: A History of American Expansionism'' (2009) ch 3, quoted on page 73.</ref>\n\n==== Annexation====\nMore controversial is whether an American war goal was to permanently acquire Canadian lands (especially western Ontario), or whether it was planned to seize the area temporarily, as a bargaining chip. The American desire for Canadian land has been a staple in Canadian public opinion since the 1830s, and was much discussed among historians before 1940, but has become less popular since then. The idea was first developed by Marxist historian [[Louis M. Hacker]] and refined by diplomatic specialist Julius Pratt.<ref>Hacker (1924); Pratt (1925). Goodman (1941) refuted the idea and even Pratt gave it up. Pratt (1955)</ref> \nIn 1925, Pratt argued that Western Americans were incited to war by the prospect of seizing Canada.<ref>Julius W. Pratt,  \"Western Aims in the War of 1812.\" ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1925): 36-50. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1891784 in JSTOR]</ref>  Pratt's argument supported the belief of many Canadians, especially in Ontario, where fear of American expansionism was a major political element. To this day the notion still survives among Canadians.<ref>W. Arthur Bowler, \"Propaganda in Upper Canada in the War of 1812,\" ''American Review of Canadian Studies'' (1988) 28:11\u201332; C.P. Stacey, \"The War of 1812 in Canadian History\" in Morris Zaslow and Wesley B. Turner, eds. ''The Defended Border: Upper Canada and the War of 1812'' (Toronto, 1964)</ref> \n[[File:United States 1812-05-1812-06.png|left|thumb]]\n\nIn 2010 American historian [[Alan Taylor (historian)|Alan Taylor]] examined the political dimension of the annexation issue as Congress debated whether to declare war in 1811-12. The [[Federalist party]] was strongly opposed to war and to annexation, as were the northeastern states. The majority in Congress was held by the Jeffersonian Republican party, which split on the issue. One faction wanted to permanently expel Britain and annex Canada.  [[John Randolph of Roanoke]], representing Virginia, commented, \"Agrarian greed not maritime right urges this war. We have heard but one word - like the whipporwill's one monotonous tone: Canada! Canada! Canada!\"{{sfn|Fregosi|1989|p=328}}The other faction,  based in the South, said that acquiring new territory in the north would give the northern states too much power, and opposed the incorporation into Canada of a Catholic population which it viewed as \"unfit by faith, language and illiteracy for republican citizenship.\"  The Senate held a series of debates, and twice voted on proposals to explicitly endorse annexation, neither of which passed, although the second one only failed because of a proviso stating that Canada could be returned to British rule after being annexed. War was declared with no mention of annexation although widespread support existed among the War Hawks for it. Some Southerners supported expansionism; Tennessee Senator [[Felix Grundy]] considered it essential to acquire Canada to ''preserve'' domestic political balance, arguing that annexing Canada would maintain the free state-slave state balance, which might otherwise be thrown off by the acquisition of Florida and the settlement of the southern areas of the new [[Louisiana Purchase]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Roderick Heller|title=Democracy's Lawyer: Felix Grundy of the Old Southwest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8mM8D9RVu4C&pg=PA98|year=2010|page=98}}</ref>\n\nEven [[James Monroe]] and [[Henry Clay]], key officials in the government, expected to gain at least Upper Canada from a successful war. American commanders like General William Hull and Alexander Smythe issued proclamations to Canadians and their troops assuring them that annexations would in fact occur during the war. Smythe wrote to his troops that when they entered Canada \"You enter a country that is to become one with the United States. You will arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens.\"  <ref>Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, & Indian Allies'' (2010) pp 137-40.</ref>\n\n====Seizing Canada as a bargaining chip====\nToday historians generally agree that an invasion and temporary seizure of Canada was the central American military strategy once the war began.  Given British control of the oceans, there was no other way to actively fight against British interests. President Madison believed that food supplies from Canada were essential to the British overseas empire in the West Indies, and that an American seizure would be an excellent bargaining chip at the peace conference. During the war, some Americans speculated that they might as well keep all of Canada. Thomas Jefferson, for example, although now out of power, argued that expulsion of British interests from nearby Canada would remove a long-term threat to American republicanism. New Zealand historian J.G.A. Stagg argues that Madison and his advisers believed that conquest of Canada would be easy and that economic coercion would force the British to come to terms by cutting off the food supply for their highly valuable West Indies sugar colonies. Furthermore, possession of Canada would be a valuable bargaining chip. Stagg suggests frontiersmen demanded the seizure of Canada not because they wanted the land (they had plenty), but because the British were thought to be arming the Indians and thereby blocking settlement of the west.<ref>Stagg (1983)</ref> As Horsman concludes, \"The idea of conquering Canada had been present since at least 1807 as a means of forcing England to change her policy at sea. The conquest of Canada was primarily a means of waging war, not a reason for starting it.\"<ref>Horsman (1962) p. 267</ref> Hickey flatly states, \"The desire to annex Canada did not bring on the war.\" <ref>Hickey (1990) p. 72.</ref> Brown (1964) concludes, \"The purpose of the Canadian expedition was to serve negotiation not to annex Canada.\"<ref>Brown p. 128.</ref> Burt, a Canadian scholar, but also a professor at an American university, agrees completely, noting that Foster, the British minister to Washington, also rejected the argument that annexation of Canada was a war goal.<ref>Burt (1940) pp 305\u201310.</ref> However, Foster also rejected the possibility of a declaration of war, despite having dinner with several of the more prominent War Hawks, so his judgement in these matters can be questioned.\n\nHowever,  historian J. C. A. Stagg states that, \"... had the War 1812 been a successful military venture, the Madison administration would have been reluctant to have returned occupied Canadian territory to the enemy.\"{{sfn| Stagg| 1983| p=4}} Other authors concur, one stating, \"Expansion was not the only American objective, and indeed not the immediate one.

The Loyalists were extremely hostile to union with the U.S., while the other settlers seem to have been uninterested and remained neutral during the war. The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army, and some Americans believed that the many in Upper Canada would rise up and greet an American invading army as liberators.<ref>Fred Landon, ''Western Ontario and the American Frontier'' (1941) pp 12\u201322</ref> The combination implied an easy conquest. Once the war began retired president [[Thomas Jefferson]] warned that the British presence posed a grave threat, pointing to \"The infamous intrigues of Great Britain to destroy our government....and with the Indians to Tomahawk our women and children, prove that the cession of Canada, their fulcrum for these Machiavellian levers, must be a ''sine qua non'' at a treaty of peace. Jefferson predicted in late 1812, \"the acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=James Laxer|title=Tecumseh and Brock: The War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQb5JI-G9bwC&pg=PA129|year=2012|page=129}}</ref>\n\nMaass argued in 2015 that the expansionist theme is a myth that goes against the \"relative consensus among experts that the primary U.S. objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions. He argues that consensus among scholars is that The United States went to war \"because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table, and threatening the Royal Navy's Canadian supply base was their last hope.\" However, he also notes that many historians continue to publish in support of expansionism as a cause, and that even those opposed to the idea continue to include caveats regarding \"possible expansionism underlying US motives\". Maass agrees that theoretically expansionism might have tempted Americans, but finds that \"leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so. Notably, what limited expansionism there was focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements [of Canada].\" <ref>Richard W. Maass, \"Difficult to Relinquish Territory Which Had Been Conquered\": Expansionism and the War of 1812,\" ''Diplomatic History'' (Jan 2015) 39#1 pp 70-97 doi: 10.1093/dh/dht132 [http://dh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/01/06/dh.dht132.short Abstract Online]</ref>\n\n==Violations of American rights==\nThe long wars between Britain and France (1793\u20131815) led to repeated complaints by the U.S. that both powers violated America's right as a neutral to trade with both sides. Furthermore, Americans complained loudly that British agents in Canada were supplying munitions to hostile [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes living in [[Territorial evolution of the United States|United States territory]].\n\nStarting in the mid-1790s the [[Royal Navy]], short of manpower, began boarding American merchant ships in order to seize American and British sailors from American vessels. Although this policy of [[impressment]] was supposed to reclaim only British subjects, the law of Britain and most countries defined nationality by birth whereas the United States allowed individuals who had been resident in America for some time to adopt American citizenship. There were, therefore, large numbers of individuals who were British by British law but American by American law. The confusion was compounded by the refusal of Jefferson and Madison to issue any official citizenship documents: their position was that all persons serving on American ships were to be regarded as US citizens and that no further evidence was required. This stance was motivated by the advice of [[Albert Gallatin]], who had calculated that half of American deep-sea merchant seamen - 9,000 men - were British subjects. Allowing the Royal Navy to reclaim these men would destroy both the US economy and the vital customs revenue of the government.<ref>Rodger, Command of the Ocean, p565</ref> Any sort of accommodation would jeopardize these men, and so concords such as the proposed [[Monroe-Pinkney Treaty]] (1806) between the U.S. and Britain were rejected by Jefferson.\n\nTo fill the need for some sort of identification, US consuls provided unofficial papers. However, these relied on unverifiable declarations by the individual concerned for evidence of citizenship, and the large fees paid for the documents made them a lucrative sideline. In turn, British officers- short of personnel and convinced, not entirely unreasonably, that the US flag covered a large number of British deserters- tended to treat such papers with scorn. Between 1806 and 1812 about 6,000 seamen were impressed and taken against their will into the Royal Navy<ref>Hickey (1989) p. 11</ref> of which 3,800 were subsequently released.<ref>Rodger, Command of the Ocean, p566</ref>\n\n==Honor==\nHistorian Norman Risjord has emphasized the central importance of honor as a cause the war.<ref>Norman K. Risjord, \"1812: Conservatives, War Hawks and the Nation's Honor.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly: A Magazine of Early American History'' (1961): 196-210. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918543 in JSTOR]</ref>  Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honor, and to reject  the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response.<ref>Robert L. Ivie, \"The metaphor of force in prowar discourse: The case of 1812.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 68#3 (1982) pp: 240-253.</ref> This quest for honor was a major cause of the war in the sense that most Americans who were not involved in mercantile interests or threatened by Indian attack strongly endorsed the preservation of national honor.<ref>Bradford Perkins, ''The causes of the War of 1812: National honor or national interest?'' (1962).</ref> [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard Affair|The humiliating attack]] by HMS ''Leopard'' against USS ''Chesapeake'' in June 1807 was a decisive event.<ref>Spencer Tucker and Frank T. Reuter, ''Injured Honor: The Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, June 22, 1807'' (Naval Institute Press, 1996)</ref> Many Americans called for war, but Jefferson held back, insisting that economic warfare would prove more successful.  Jefferson initiated economic warfare, especially in the form of embargoing or refusing to sell products to Britain.  It proved a failure, that did not deter the British but it seriously damaged American industry had alienated the mercantile cities of the Northeast that were so seriously hurt.  Historians have demonstrated the motive power of honor in shaping public opinion in a number of states, including Massachusetts,<ref>William Barlow and David O.

Calhoun]] called for a declaration of war in ringing phrases, denouncing Britain's \"lust for power,\" \"unbounded tyranny,\" and \"mad ambition.\" James Roark says, \"These were fighting words in a war that was in large measure about insult and honor.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=James L.

Historian Lance Banning says: \n:National honor, the reputation of republican government, and the continuing supremacy of the Republican party had seemed to be at stake.... National honor had [now] been satisfied....Americans celebrated the end of the struggle with a brilliant burst of national pride.  They felt that they had fought a second war for independence, and had won. If little had been gained, nothing had been lost in a contest the greatest imperial power on the earth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lance Banning|title=The Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YL-HcJj1MO0C&pg=PA295|year=1980|publisher=Cornell UP|page=295}}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear whether the British acknowledged American honor, because when peace was signed, impressment remained legal. Nevertheless, the practice ended because the Napoleonic wars had ended and the Royal Navy no longer required as many men.\n\n==American economic motivations==\nThe failure of Jefferson's embargo and Madison's economic coercion, according to Horsman, \"made war or absolute submission to England the only alternatives, and the latter presented more terrors to the recent colonists. The war hawks came from the West and the South, regions that had supported economic warfare and were suffering the most from British restrictions at sea. The merchants of New England earned large profits from the wartime carrying trade, in spite of the numerous captures by both France and England, but the western and southern farmers, who looked longingly at the export market, were suffering a depression that made them demand war\".<ref>Horsman (1962) p. 266</ref>\n\n==Incidents leading up to the war==\nThis dispute came to the forefront with the [[Chesapeake-Leopard Affair]] of 1807, when the British warship HMS ''Leopard'' fired on and boarded the American warship USS ''Chesapeake'', killing three and carrying off four deserters from the [[Royal Navy]]. (Only one was a British citizen and he was subsequently hanged; the other three were American citizens and were later returned, though the last two not until 1812.) The American public was outraged by the incident, and many called for war in order to assert American sovereignty and national honor.\n\nThe Chesapeake-Leopard Affair followed closely on the similar [[HMS Leander (1780)#The Leander Affair|''Leander'' Affair]], which had resulted in President Jefferson banning certain British warships and their captains from American ports and waters. Whether in response to this incident or the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, President Jefferson banned all foreign armed vessels from American waters, except those bearing dispatches. In December 1808, an American officer expelled the schooner [[HMS Pitt (1805)|HMS ''Sandwich'']] from Savannah, Georgia, after she had entered with dispatches for the British Consul there.\n\nMeanwhile, Napoleon's [[Continental System]] (beginning 1806) and the British [[Orders in Council (1807)]] established embargoes that made international trade precarious. From 1807 to 1812, about 900 American ships were seized as a result.<ref>Hickey (1989) p. 19</ref> The U.S. responded with the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], which prohibited American ships from sailing to any foreign ports and closed American ports to British ships. Jefferson's embargo was especially unpopular in [[New England]], where merchants preferred the indignities of impressment to the halting of overseas commerce. This discontent contributed to the calling of the [[Hartford Convention]] in 1814.\n\nThe Embargo Act had no effect on Great Britain and France and was replaced by the [[Non-Intercourse Act|Non-Intercourse Act of 1809]], which lifted all embargoes on American shipping except for those bound for British or French ports. As this proved to be unenforceable, the Non-Intercourse Act was replaced in 1810 by [[Macon's Bill Number 2]]. This lifted all embargoes but offered that if either France or Great Britain were to cease their interference with American shipping, the United States would reinstate an embargo on the other nation. Napoleon, seeing an opportunity to make trouble for Great Britain, promised to leave American ships alone, and the United States reinstated the embargo with Great Britain and moved closer to declaring war.<ref>Napoleon had no intention of honouring promise: Hickey, p. 22; Horsman, p. 188.</ref>\n\nExacerbating the situation, [[Sauk people|Sauk]] Indians who controlled trade on the Upper Mississippi were displeased with the U.S. Government after the 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]]. This treaty ceded Sauk territory in Illinois and Missouri to the U.S.; the Sauk felt this treaty was unjust, that Quashquame was unauthorized to sign away land, and that he was unaware of what he was signing. The establishment of [[Fort Madison]] in 1808 on the Mississippi further aggravated the Sauk, and led many, including [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], to side with the British before the war broke out. Sauk and allied Indians, including the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago), were very effective fighters for the British on the Mississippi, helping to defeat Fort Madison and Fort McKay in [[Prairie du Chien]].\n\nOxford historian Paul Langford looks at the decisions by the British government in 1812: \n:The British ambassador in Washington [Erskine] brought affairs almost to an accommodation, and was ultimately disappointed not by American intransigence but by one of the outstanding diplomatic blunders made by a Foreign Secretary. It was [[George Canning|Canning]] who, in his most irresponsible manner and apparently out of sheer dislike of everything American, recalled the ambassador [[David Erskine, 2nd Baron Erskine|Erskine]] and wrecked the negotiations, a piece of most gratuitous folly. As a result, the possibility of a new embarrassment for Napoleon turned into the certainty of a much more serious one for his enemy. Though the British cabinet eventually made the necessary concessions on the score of the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders-in-Council]], in response to the pressures of industrial lobbying at home, its action came too late\u2026. The loss of the North American markets could have been a decisive blow. As it was by the time the United States declared war, the [[Continental System]] [of Napoleon] was beginning to crack, and the danger correspondingly diminishing.  Even so, the war, inconclusive though it proved in a military sense, was an irksome and expensive embarrassment which British statesman could have done much more to avert.<ref>Paul Langford, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The Eighteenth Century: 1688-1815'' (1976) p 228</ref>\n\n==Declaration of war==\nIn the [[United States House of Representatives]], a group of young [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republicans]] known as the \"[[War Hawk]]s\" came to the forefront in 1811, led by [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]] and [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]]. The War Hawks advocated going to war against Great Britain for all of the reasons listed above, though concentrating on the grievances more than the territorial expansion.\n\nOn the first of June 1812, President [[James Madison]] gave a speech to the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], recounting American grievances against Great Britain, though not specifically calling for a declaration of war. After Madison's speech, the House of Representatives quickly voted (79 to 49) to declare war, and the Senate by 19 to 13. The conflict formally began on  18 June 1812 when Madison signed the measure into law. This was the first time that the United States had declared war on another nation, and the Congressional vote would prove to be the closest vote to declare war in American history. None of the 39 [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]]s in Congress voted in favor of the war; critics of war subsequently referred to it as \"Mr. Madison's War.\"\n<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj005181)) Journal of the Senate of the United States of America, 1789\u20131873]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chronology of the War of 1812]]\n* [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|Opposition to the War of 1812]]\n* [[Results of the War of 1812]]\n* [[War of 1812]]\n* [[War of 1812 bibliography]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Adams, Henry.

The team has had 13&nbsp;head coaches since organized football began in 1951 at Northeast Louisiana with the nickname ''Indians''. The Warhawks have played in more than 629&nbsp;games during their 59&nbsp;seasons. No coaches have led the Warhawks to a postseason bowl game. Three&nbsp;coaches have won conference championships with the Warhawks: [[Pat Collins (American football)|Pat Collins]] and [[Dave Roberts (coach)|Dave Roberts]] in the [[Southland Conference]] and [[Charlie Weatherbie]] in the [[Sun Belt Conference]].  Collins also won one [[NCAA Division I FCS National Football Championship|national championship]] with the Warhawks when they competed in what is now the [[Football Championship Subdivision]]. As of the end of the 2009 season, Collins is the all-time leader in games coached (92), years coached (8), and wins (57), while Roberts is the all-time leader in [[winning percentage]] at .661. [[Bobby Keasler]] is, in terms of winning percentage, the worst coach the Warhawks have had, with a record of 8-28 (.222) in four seasons.\n\nOf the 13 Warhawks coaches, only one has been inducted in the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], [[John David Crow]], who was inducted as a player. None have received National Coach of the Year honors. The current coach is [[Todd Berry]], who was hired in December 2009.\n\n==Key==\n{{List of college football program head coaches key}}\n\n==Coaches==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ List of head football coaches showing season(s) coached, overall records, conference records, postseason records, championships and selected awards{{#tag:ref|Statistics correct as of the end of the [[2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2012 college football season]].|group=\"A\"}}\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | No.<br>{{#tag:ref|A running total of the number of coaches of the Warhawks.

Juveniles are brown with dark brown eyes.\n\nWhen grackles are in a group, they are referred to as a \"plague.\"<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Murphy-Hiscock\n | first = Arin\n | title =  Birds - A Spiritual Field Guide: Explore the Symbology and Significance of These Divine Winged Messengers\n | publisher = Adams Media\n | date = January 2012\n | pages = 86\n | isbn = 978-1-4405-2688-6}}\n</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Spinus-common-grackle-2015-03-n029780-w.jpg|thumb|left|Common grackle (''Quiscalus quiscula'') in [[Central Park]], New York]]\nThe breeding habitat is open and semiopen areas across North America east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The nest is a well-concealed cup in dense trees (particularly pine) or shrubs, usually near water; sometimes, the common grackle nests in cavities or in man-made structures. It often nests in colonies, some being quite large. Bird houses are also a suitable nesting site. Four to seven eggs are in a clutch.\n\nThis bird is a permanent resident in much of its range. Northern birds [[bird migration|migrate]] in flocks to the Southeastern United States.\n\n==Ecology and behavior==\n\n=== Foraging and Diet ===\nThe common grackle forages on the ground, in shallow water, or in shrubs; it may steal food from other birds. It is [[omnivore|omnivorous]], eating [[insect]]s, [[Leuciscinae|minnow]]s, [[frog]]s, [[egg (biology)|eggs]], [[Berry|berries]], [[seed]]s, [[cereal|grain]], and even small birds and mice. Grackles at outdoor eating areas often wait eagerly until an unwary bird drops some food. They rush forward and try to grab it, often snatching food out of the beak of another bird. Grackles prefer to eat from the ground at [[bird feeder]]s, making scattered seed an excellent choice of food for them. Grackles can be regularly seen foraging for insects, especially after a lawn trimming.\n\nGrackles have an unique adaptation in the keel within their bill which allows them to crack and cut hard nuts or kernels. The keel projects downward from the horny palate and is sharper and more abrupt anterior. It extends below the level of the tomium and is used in a sawing motion to score open acorns or dried kernels. Large adductor muscle  within their jaw compared to other icterids also makes this adaptation even more useful for opening hard seeds and acorns.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beecher|first=William|date=1951|title=ADAPTATIONS FOR FOOD-GETTING IN THE\nAMERICAN BLACKBIRDS|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v068n04/p0411-p0440.pdf|journal=The Auk|volume=68|pages=420-422|via=}}</ref> \n\nAlong with some other species of grackles, the common grackle is known to practice \"[[Anting (bird activity)|anting]]\", rubbing insects on its feathers possibly to apply liquids such as [[formic acid]] secreted by the insects.\n\n=== Vocals ===\nThe grackle's song is particularly harsh, especially when these birds, in a flock, are calling. Songs vary from year-round ''chewink chewink'' to a more complex breeding season ''ooo whew,whew,whew,whew,whew'' call that gets faster and faster and ends with a loud ''crewhewwhew!'' It also occasionally sounds like a power line buzzing. The grackle can also mimic the sounds of other birds or even humans, though not as precisely as the [[mockingbird]], which is known to share its habitat in the Southeastern United States.\n\n=== Breeding ===\nIn the breeding season, males tip their heads back and fluff up feathers to display and keep other males away. This same behavior is used as a defensive posture to attempt to intimidate predators. Male common grackles are less aggressive toward one another, and more cooperative and social, than the larger boat-tailed grackle species.\n\n==Relationship with humans==\nThe range of this bird expanded west as forests were cleared. In some areas, it is now considered a pest by farmers because of its large numbers and fondness for grain. Despite a currently robust population, a recent study by the [[National Audubon Society]] of data from the [[Christmas Bird Count]] indicated that populations had declined by 61% to a population of 73 million from historic highs of over 190 million birds.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Strassburg |first=Matthew David |date=November 2011 |title=The evaluation of Christmas Bird Counts as an indicator of population trends and habitat selection in blackbirds and starlings |type=MSc |publisher=North Dakota State University |url=https://library.ndsu.edu/ir/bitstream/handle/10365/19385/Evaluation%20of%20Christmas%20Bird%20Counts%20as%20an%20Indicator%20of%20Population%20Trends%20and%20Habitat%20Selection%20in%20Blackbirds%20and%20Starlings.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y |access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nUnlike many birds, the grackle benefits from the expansion of human populations due to its resourceful and opportunistic nature. Common grackles are considered a serious threat to crops by some, and notoriously difficult to exterminate and usually require the use of hawks or similar large [[birds of prey]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Murder Most Fowl| publisher=Time Magazine| url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1582197,00.html}}</ref>\n\n== Proposed magnetoreceptivity ==\nThough the exact mechanism is poorly understood, several studies have examined the ability of the common grackle to interpret the [[Earth's magnetic field]]\u2014or in this case, the variability of it. The common grackle, (like most of its ''[[Quiscalus]]'' relatives) has been found to exhibit a scientifically significant attunation with a dynamic magnetic field.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1992|title=NATURAL AND INDUCED REMANENT MAGNETISM IN BIRDS|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v109n01/p0043-p0056.pdf|journal=The Auk|volume=109|pages=43\u201356|via=Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Oklahoma}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Common Grackle - markings.jpg|Iridescent back\nImage:Common_Grackle - Iridescence.jpg|Iridescence in direct sunlight\nImage:Common_Grackle_Leucistic.jpg|[[Leucism|Partially leucistic]]/[[piebald]]\nFile:Baby grackle - Quiscalus quiscula.jpg|Chick\nFile:An albino grackle photographed in Peterborough Ontario 2012.jpg|An albino grackle photographed in Peterborough, Ontario, 2012\nFile:Grackle IMG 3972.jpg|Male feeding in grass\nFile:Common_Grackle_(Quiscalus_quiscula).jpg|In Ontario, Canada\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added under references heading by script-assisted edit--><!-- WilsonBull18:47 (compare to current Ohio checklist http://www.ohiobirds.org/publications/OBRClist.pdf) -->\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Quiscalus quiscula|the common grackle}}\n{{Wikispecies|Quiscalus quiscula}}\n* {{InternetBirdCollection|common-grackle-quiscalus-quiscula|Common grackle}}\n* [http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Common_Grackle.html Common grackle] - Cornell Lab of Ornithology\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120710021754/http://stateofthebirds.audubon.org/CBID/ Audubon's Common Birds in Decline Report]\n* [https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/birds/florida-bird-sounds/ Florida bird sounds including the common grackle] - Florida Museum of Natural History\n* {{VIREO|Common+Grackle|Common grackle}}\n<!--\n==Further reading==\n===Book===\n\n* Peer, B.

The nest is a well-concealed cup in dense trees (particularly pine) or shrubs, usually near water; sometimes, the common grackle nests in cavities or in man-made structures. It often nests in colonies, some being quite large. Bird houses are also a suitable nesting site. Four to seven eggs are in a clutch.\n\nThis bird is a permanent resident in much of its range. Northern birds [[bird migration|migrate]] in flocks to the Southeastern United States.\n\n==Ecology and behavior==\n\n=== Foraging and Diet ===\nThe common grackle forages on the ground, in shallow water, or in shrubs; it may steal food from other birds. It is [[omnivore|omnivorous]], eating [[insect]]s, [[Leuciscinae|minnow]]s, [[frog]]s, [[egg (biology)|eggs]], [[Berry|berries]], [[seed]]s, [[cereal|grain]], and even small birds and mice. Grackles at outdoor eating areas often wait eagerly until an unwary bird drops some food. They rush forward and try to grab it, often snatching food out of the beak of another bird. Grackles prefer to eat from the ground at [[bird feeder]]s, making scattered seed an excellent choice of food for them. Grackles can be regularly seen foraging for insects, especially after a lawn trimming.\n\nGrackles have an unique adaptation in the keel within their bill which allows them to crack and cut hard nuts or kernels. The keel projects downward from the horny palate and is sharper and more abrupt anterior. It extends below the level of of the tomium and is used in a sawing motion to score open acorns or dried kernels. Large adductor muscle  within their jaw compared to other icterids also makes this adaptation even more useful for opening hard seeds and acorns.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beecher|first=William|date=1951|title=ADAPTATIONS FOR FOOD-GETTING IN THE\nAMERICAN BLACKBIRDS|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v068n04/p0411-p0440.pdf|journal=The Auk|volume=68|pages=420-422|via=}}</ref> \n\nAlong with some other species of grackles, the common grackle is known to practice \"[[Anting (bird activity)|anting]]\", rubbing insects on its feathers possibly to apply liquids such as [[formic acid]] secreted by the insects.\n\n=== Vocals ===\nThe grackle's song is particularly harsh, especially when these birds, in a flock, are calling. Songs vary from year-round ''chewink chewink'' to a more complex breeding season ''ooo whew,whew,whew,whew,whew'' call that gets faster and faster and ends with a loud ''crewhewwhew!'' It also occasionally sounds like a power line buzzing. The grackle can also mimic the sounds of other birds or even humans, though not as precisely as the [[mockingbird]], which is known to share its habitat in the Southeastern United States.\n\n=== Breeding ===\nIn the breeding season, males tip their heads back and fluff up feathers to display and keep other males away. This same behavior is used as a defensive posture to attempt to intimidate predators. Male common grackles are less aggressive toward one another, and more cooperative and social, than the larger boat-tailed grackle species.\n\n==Relationship with humans==\nThe range of this bird expanded west as forests were cleared. In some areas, it is now considered a pest by farmers because of its large numbers and fondness for grain. Despite a currently robust population, a recent study by the [[National Audubon Society]] of data from the [[Christmas Bird Count]] indicated that populations had declined by 61% to a population of 73 million from historic highs of over 190 million birds.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Strassburg |first=Matthew David |date=November 2011 |title=The evaluation of Christmas Bird Counts as an indicator of population trends and habitat selection in blackbirds and starlings |type=MSc |publisher=North Dakota State University |url=https://library.ndsu.edu/ir/bitstream/handle/10365/19385/Evaluation%20of%20Christmas%20Bird%20Counts%20as%20an%20Indicator%20of%20Population%20Trends%20and%20Habitat%20Selection%20in%20Blackbirds%20and%20Starlings.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y |access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nUnlike many birds, the grackle benefits from the expansion of human populations due to its resourceful and opportunistic nature. Common grackles are considered a serious threat to crops by some, and notoriously difficult to exterminate and usually require the use of hawks or similar large [[birds of prey]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Murder Most Fowl| publisher=Time Magazine| url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1582197,00.html}}</ref>\n\n== Proposed magnetoreceptivity ==\nThough the exact mechanism is poorly understood, several studies have examined the ability of the common grackle to interpret the [[Earth's magnetic field]]\u2014or in this case, the variability of it. The common grackle, (like most of its ''[[Quiscalus]]'' relatives) has been found to exhibit a scientifically significant attunation with a dynamic magnetic field.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1992|title=NATURAL AND INDUCED REMANENT MAGNETISM IN BIRDS|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v109n01/p0043-p0056.pdf|journal=The Auk|volume=109|pages=43\u201356|via=Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Oklahoma}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Common Grackle - markings.jpg|Iridescent back\nImage:Common_Grackle - Iridescence.jpg|Iridescence in direct sunlight\nImage:Common_Grackle_Leucistic.jpg|[[Leucism|Partially leucistic]]/[[piebald]]\nFile:Baby grackle - Quiscalus quiscula.jpg|Chick\nFile:An albino grackle photographed in Peterborough Ontario 2012.jpg|An albino grackle photographed in Peterborough, Ontario, 2012\nFile:Grackle IMG 3972.jpg|Male feeding in grass\nFile:Common_Grackle_(Quiscalus_quiscula).jpg|In Ontario, Canada\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added under references heading by script-assisted edit--><!-- WilsonBull18:47 (compare to current Ohio checklist http://www.ohiobirds.org/publications/OBRClist.pdf) -->\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Quiscalus quiscula|the common grackle}}\n{{Wikispecies|Quiscalus quiscula}}\n* {{InternetBirdCollection|common-grackle-quiscalus-quiscula|Common grackle}}\n* [http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Common_Grackle.html Common grackle] - Cornell Lab of Ornithology\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120710021754/http://stateofthebirds.audubon.org/CBID/ Audubon's Common Birds in Decline Report]\n* [https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/birds/florida-bird-sounds/ Florida bird sounds including the common grackle] - Florida Museum of Natural History\n* {{VIREO|Common+Grackle|Common grackle}}\n<!--\n==Further reading==\n===Book===\n\n* Peer, B.

Blocks that moved from one frame to the next are shown as white arrows, making the motions of the different platforms and the character clearly visible.]]\n'''Motion compensation''' is an algorithmic technique used to predict a frame in a video, given the previous and/or future frames by accounting for motion of the camera and/or objects in the video. It is employed in the encoding of video data for [[video compression]], for example in the generation of [[MPEG-2]] files. Motion compensation describes a picture in terms of the transformation of a reference picture to the current picture. The reference picture may be previous in time or even from the future. When images can be accurately synthesized from previously transmitted/stored images, the compression efficiency can be improved.\n\nMotion compensation is one of the two key [[video compression]] techniques used in [[video coding standards]], along with the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT). Most video coding standards, such as the [[H.26x]] and [[MPEG]] formats, typically use motion-compensated DCT hybrid coding,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chen |first1=Jie |last2=Koc |first2=Ut-Va |last3=Liu |first3=KJ Ray |title=Design of Digital Video Coding Systems: A Complete Compressed Domain Approach |date=2001 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9780203904183 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUzFKU3HeegC&pg=PA71}}</ref><ref name=\"Li\"/> known as block motion compensation (BMC) or motion-compensated DCT (MC DCT).\n\n== Functionality ==\nMotion compensation exploits the fact that, often, for many [[Film frame|frames]] of a movie, the only difference between one frame and another is the result of either the camera moving or an object in the frame moving. In reference to a video file, this means much of the information that represents one frame will be the same as the information used in the next frame.\n\nUsing motion compensation, a video stream will contain some full (reference) frames; then the only information stored for the frames in between would be the information needed to transform the previous frame into the next frame.\n\n== Illustrated example ==\nThe following is a simplistic illustrated explanation of how motion compensation works. Two successive frames were captured from the movie ''[[Elephants Dream]]''. As can be seen from the images, the bottom (motion compensated) difference between two frames contains significantly less detail than the prior images, and thus compresses much better than the rest. Thus the information that is required to encode compensated frame will be much smaller than with the difference frame. This also means that it is also possible to encode the information using difference image at a cost of less compression efficiency but by saving coding complexity without motion compensated coding; as a matter of fact that motion compensated coding (together with [[motion estimation]], motion compensation) occupies more than 90% of encoding complexity. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The share in bit-rate of these parameters is negligible.\n* It does not partition the frames. This avoids artifacts at partition borders.\n* A straight line (in the time direction) of pixels with equal spatial positions in the frame corresponds to a continuously moving point in the real scene. Other MC schemes introduce discontinuities in the time direction.\n\nMPEG-4 ASP supports GMC with three reference points, although some implementations can only make use of one. A single reference point only allows for translational motion which for its relatively large performance cost provides little advantage over block based motion compensation.\n\nMoving objects within a frame are not sufficiently represented by global motion compensation.\nThus, local [[motion estimation]] is also needed.\n\n== Motion-compensated DCT ==\n=== Block motion compensation ===\n\n'''Block motion compensation''' (BMC), also known as motion-compensated [[discrete cosine transform]] (MC DCT), is the most widely used motion compensation technique.<ref name=\"Li\">{{cite book |last1=Li |first1=Jian Ping |title=Proceedings of the International Computer Conference 2006 on Wavelet Active Media Technology and Information Processing: Chongqing, China, 29-31 August 2006 |date=2006 |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |isbn=9789812709998 |page=847 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZiK3zXdK7sC&pg=PA847}}</ref> In BMC, the frames are partitioned in blocks of pixels (e.g. macro-blocks of 16&times;16 pixels in [[MPEG]]).\nEach block is predicted from a block of equal size in the reference frame.\nThe blocks are not transformed in any way apart from being shifted to the position of the predicted block.\nThis shift is represented by a ''motion vector''.\n\nTo exploit the redundancy between neighboring block vectors, (e.g. for a single moving object covered by multiple blocks) it is common to encode only the difference between the current and previous motion vector in the bit-stream. The result of this differentiating process is mathematically equivalent to a global motion compensation capable of panning.\nFurther down the encoding pipeline, an [[entropy encoding|entropy coder]] will take advantage of the resulting statistical distribution of the motion vectors around the zero vector to reduce the output size.\n\nIt is possible to shift a block by a non-integer number of pixels, which is called ''sub-pixel precision''.\nThe in-between pixels are generated by interpolating neighboring pixels. Commonly, half-pixel or quarter pixel precision ([[Qpel]], used by H.264 and MPEG-4/ASP) is used. The computational expense of sub-pixel precision is much higher due to the extra processing required for interpolation and on the encoder side, a much greater number of potential source blocks to be evaluated.\n\nThe main disadvantage of block motion compensation is that it introduces discontinuities at the block borders (blocking artifacts).\nThese artifacts appear in the form of sharp horizontal and vertical edges which are easily spotted by the human eye and produce false edges and ringing effects (large coefficients in high frequency sub-bands) due to quantization of coefficients of the [[List of Fourier-related transforms|Fourier-related transform]] used for [[transform coding]] of the [[residual frame]]s<ref>Zeng, Kai, et al. \"Characterizing perceptual artifacts in compressed video streams.\" IS&T/SPIE Electronic Imaging. International Society for Optics and Photonics, 2014.</ref>\n\nBlock motion compensation divides up the ''current'' frame into non-overlapping blocks, and the motion compensation vector tells where those blocks come ''from''\n(a common misconception is that the ''previous frame'' is divided up into non-overlapping blocks, and the motion compensation vectors tell where those blocks move ''to'').\nThe source blocks typically overlap in the source frame.\nSome video compression algorithms assemble the current frame out of pieces of several different previously-transmitted frames.\n\nFrames can also be predicted from future frames.\nThe future frames then need to be encoded before the predicted frames and thus, the encoding order does not necessarily match the real frame order.\nSuch frames are usually predicted from two directions, i.e. from the I- or P-frames that immediately precede or follow the predicted frame.\nThese bidirectionally predicted frames are called [[Video compression picture types|''B-frames'']].\nA coding scheme could, for instance, be IBBPBBPBBPBB.\n\nFurther, the use of triangular tiles has also been proposed for motion compensation. Under this scheme, the frame is tiled with triangles, and the next frame is generated by performing an affine transformation on these triangles.<ref>Aizawa, Kiyoharu, and Thomas S. Huang. \"Model-based image coding advanced video coding techniques for very low bit-rate applications.\" Proceedings of the IEEE 83.2 (1995): 259-271.</ref> Only the affine transformations are recorded/transmitted. This is capable of dealing with zooming, rotation, translation etc.\n\n=== Variable block-size motion compensation ===\n'''Variable block-size motion compensation''' (VBSMC) is the use of BMC with the ability for the encoder to dynamically select the size of the blocks.  When coding video, the use of larger blocks can reduce the number of bits needed to represent the motion vectors, while the use of smaller blocks can result in a smaller amount of prediction residual information to encode.  Other areas of work have examined the use of variable-shape feature metrics, beyond block boundaries, from which interframe vectors can be calculated<ref>{{Cite book|last=Garnham|first=Nigel W.|title=Motion Compensated Video Coding - PhD Thesis|publisher=University of Nottingham|year=1995|location=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/13447/1/thesis.pdf|pages=}}</ref>.  Older designs such as [[H.261]] and [[MPEG-1]] video typically use a fixed block size, while newer ones such as [[H.263]], [[MPEG-4 Part 2]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]], and [[VC-1]] give the encoder the ability to dynamically choose what block size will be used to represent the motion.\n\n=== Overlapped block motion compensation ===\n\n'''Overlapped block motion compensation''' (OBMC) is a good solution to these problems because it not only increases prediction accuracy but also avoids blocking artifacts.  When using OBMC,\nblocks are typically twice as big in each dimension and overlap quadrant-wise with all 8 neighbouring blocks.\nThus, each pixel belongs to 4 blocks.  In such a scheme, there are 4 predictions for each pixel which are summed up to a weighted mean.\nFor this purpose, blocks are associated with a window function that has the property that the sum of 4 overlapped windows is equal to 1 everywhere.\n\nStudies of methods for reducing the complexity of OBMC have shown that the contribution to the window function is smallest for the diagonally-adjacent block.  Reducing the weight for this contribution to zero and increasing the other weights by an equal amount leads to a substantial reduction in complexity without a large penalty in quality.  In such a scheme, each pixel then belongs to 3 blocks rather than 4, and rather than using 8 neighboring blocks, only 4 are used for each block to be compensated.  Such a scheme is found in the [[H.263]] Annex F Advanced Prediction mode\n\n== Quarter Pixel (QPel) and Half Pixel motion compensation ==\n\nIn motion compensation, quarter or half samples are actually interpolated sub-samples caused by fractional motion vectors. Based on the vectors and full-samples, the sub-samples can be calculated by using bicubic or bilinear 2-D filtering.  See subclause 8.4.2.2 \"Fractional sample interpolation process\" of the H.264 standard.\n\n== 3D image coding techniques ==\n\nMotion compensation is utilized in [[Stereoscopic Video Coding]]\n\nIn video, ''time'' is often considered as the third dimension. Still image coding techniques can be expanded to an extra dimension.\n\n[[JPEG 2000]] uses wavelets, and these can also be used to encode motion without gaps between blocks in an adaptive way. Fractional pixel [[affine transformation]]s lead to bleeding between adjacent pixels. If no higher internal resolution is used the delta images mostly fight against the image smearing out. The delta image can also be encoded as wavelets, so that the borders of the adaptive blocks match.\n\n[[2D+Delta]] Encoding techniques utilize [[H.264]] and [[MPEG-2]] compatible coding and can use motion compensation to compress between stereoscopic images.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Video coding format}}\n\nA precursor to the concept of motion compensation dates back to 1929, when R.D. Kell in Britain proposed the concept of transmitting only the portions of an [[analog video]] scene that changed from frame-to-frame. The concept of [[inter-frame]] motion compensation dates back to 1959, when [[NHK]] researchers Y. Taki, M. Hatori and S. Tanaka proposed predictive inter-frame [[video coding]] in the [[temporal dimension]].<ref name=\"ITU\">{{cite web |title=History of Video Compression |url=https://www.itu.int/wftp3/av-arch/jvt-site/2002_07_Klagenfurt/JVT-D068.doc |website=[[ITU-T]] |publisher=Joint Video Team (JVT) of ISO/IEC MPEG & ITU-T VCEG (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 and ITU-T SG16 Q.6) |date=July 2002 |pages=11, 24-9, 33, 40-1, 53-6 |accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Motion-compensated DCT===\nPractical motion-compensated [[video compression]] was made possible by the development of motion-compensated [[Discrete cosine transform|DCT]] (MC DCT) coding,<ref name=\"Lea\">{{cite book |last1=Lea |first1=William |title=Video on demand: Research Paper 94/68 |date=1994 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |location=9 May 1994 |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP94-68 |accessdate=20 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082623/https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP94-68 |archive-date=20 September 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> also called block motion compensation (BMC) or DCT motion compensation.

Most video coding standards, such as the [[H.26x]] and [[MPEG]] formats, typically use motion-compensated DCT hybrid coding,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chen |first1=Jie |last2=Koc |first2=Ut-Va |last3=Liu |first3=KJ Ray |title=Design of Digital Video Coding Systems: A Complete Compressed Domain Approach |date=2001 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9780203904183 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUzFKU3HeegC&pg=PA71}}</ref><ref name=\"Li\"/> known as block motion compensation (BMC) or motion-compensated DCT (MC DCT).\n\n== Functionality ==\nMotion compensation exploits the fact that, often, for many [[Film frame|frames]] of a movie, the only difference between one frame and another is the result of either the camera moving or an object in the frame moving. In reference to a video file, this means much of the information that represents one frame will be the same as the information used in the next frame.\n\nUsing motion compensation, a video stream will contain some full (reference) frames; then the only information stored for the frames in between would be the information needed to transform the previous frame into the next frame.\n\n== Illustrated example ==\nThe following is a simplistic illustrated explanation of how motion compensation works. Two successive frames were captured from the movie ''[[Elephants Dream]]''. As can be seen from the images, the bottom (motion compensated) difference between two frames contains significantly less detail than the prior images, and thus compresses much better than the rest. Thus the information that is required to encode compensated frame will be much smaller than with the difference frame. This also means that it is also possible to encode the information using difference image at a cost of less compression efficiency but by saving coding complexity without motion compensated coding; as a matter of fact that motion compensated coding (together with [[motion estimation]], motion compensation) occupies more than 90% of encoding complexity. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The share in bit-rate of these parameters is negligible.\n* It does not partition the frames. This avoids artifacts at partition borders.\n* A straight line (in the time direction) of pixels with equal spatial positions in the frame corresponds to a continuously moving point in the real scene. Other MC schemes introduce discontinuities in the time direction.\n\nMPEG-4 ASP supports GMC with three reference points, although some implementations can only make use of one. A single reference point only allows for translational motion which for its relatively large performance cost provides little advantage over block based motion compensation.\n\nMoving objects within a frame are not sufficiently represented by global motion compensation.\nThus, local [[motion estimation]] is also needed.\n\n== Motion-compensated DCT ==\n=== Block motion compensation ===\n\n'''Block motion compensation''' (BMC), also known as motion-compensated [[discrete cosine transform]] (MC DCT), is the most widely used motion compensation technique.<ref name=\"Li\">{{cite book |last1=Li |first1=Jian Ping |title=Proceedings of the International Computer Conference 2006 on Wavelet Active Media Technology and Information Processing: Chongqing, China, 29-31 August 2006 |date=2006 |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |isbn=9789812709998 |page=847 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZiK3zXdK7sC&pg=PA847}}</ref> In BMC, the frames are partitioned in blocks of pixels (e.g. macro-blocks of 16&times;16 pixels in [[MPEG]]).\nEach block is predicted from a block of equal size in the reference frame.\nThe blocks are not transformed in any way apart from being shifted to the position of the predicted block.\nThis shift is represented by a ''motion vector''.\n\nTo exploit the redundancy between neighboring block vectors, (e.g. for a single moving object covered by multiple blocks) it is common to encode only the difference between the current and previous motion vector in the bit-stream. The result of this differentiating process is mathematically equivalent to a global motion compensation capable of panning.\nFurther down the encoding pipeline, an [[entropy encoding|entropy coder]] will take advantage of the resulting statistical distribution of the motion vectors around the zero vector to reduce the output size.\n\nIt is possible to shift a block by a non-integer number of pixels, which is called ''sub-pixel precision''.\nThe in-between pixels are generated by interpolating neighboring pixels. Commonly, half-pixel or quarter pixel precision ([[Qpel]], used by H.264 and MPEG-4/ASP) is used. The computational expense of sub-pixel precision is much higher due to the extra processing required for interpolation and on the encoder side, a much greater number of potential source blocks to be evaluated.\n\nThe main disadvantage of block motion compensation is that it introduces discontinuities at the block borders (blocking artifacts).\nThese artifacts appear in the form of sharp horizontal and vertical edges which are easily spotted by the human eye and produce false edges and ringing effects (large coefficients in high frequency sub-bands) due to quantization of coefficients of the [[List of Fourier-related transforms|Fourier-related transform]] used for [[transform coding]] of the [[residual frame]]s<ref>Zeng, Kai, et al. \"Characterizing perceptual artifacts in compressed video streams.\" IS&T/SPIE Electronic Imaging. International Society for Optics and Photonics, 2014.</ref>\n\nBlock motion compensation divides up the ''current'' frame into non-overlapping blocks, and the motion compensation vector tells where those blocks come ''from''\n(a common misconception is that the ''previous frame'' is divided up into non-overlapping blocks, and the motion compensation vectors tell where those blocks move ''to'').\nThe source blocks typically overlap in the source frame.\nSome video compression algorithms assemble the current frame out of pieces of several different previously-transmitted frames.\n\nFrames can also be predicted from future frames.\nThe future frames then need to be encoded before the predicted frames and thus, the encoding order does not necessarily match the real frame order.\nSuch frames are usually predicted from two directions, i.e. from the I- or P-frames that immediately precede or follow the predicted frame.\nThese bidirectionally predicted frames are called [[Video compression picture types|''B-frames'']].\nA coding scheme could, for instance, be IBBPBBPBBPBB.\n\nFurther, the use of triangular tiles has also been proposed for motion compensation. Under this scheme, the frame is tiled with triangles, and the next frame is generated by performing an affine transformation on these triangles.<ref>Aizawa, Kiyoharu, and Thomas S. Huang. \"Model-based image coding advanced video coding techniques for very low bit-rate applications.\" Proceedings of the IEEE 83.2 (1995): 259-271.</ref> Only the affine transformations are recorded/transmitted. This is capable of dealing with zooming, rotation, translation etc.\n\n=== Variable block-size motion compensation ===\n'''Variable block-size motion compensation''' (VBSMC) is the use of BMC with the ability for the encoder to dynamically select the size of the blocks.  When coding video, the use of larger blocks can reduce the number of bits needed to represent the motion vectors, while the use of smaller blocks can result in a smaller amount of prediction residual information to encode.  Older designs such as [[H.261]] and [[MPEG-1]] video typically use a fixed block size, while newer ones such as [[H.263]], [[MPEG-4 Part 2]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]], and [[VC-1]] give the encoder the ability to dynamically choose what block size will be used to represent the motion.\n\n=== Overlapped block motion compensation ===\n\n'''Overlapped block motion compensation''' (OBMC) is a good solution to these problems because it not only increases prediction accuracy but also avoids blocking artifacts.  When using OBMC,\nblocks are typically twice as big in each dimension and overlap quadrant-wise with all 8 neighbouring blocks.\nThus, each pixel belongs to 4 blocks.  In such a scheme, there are 4 predictions for each pixel which are summed up to a weighted mean.\nFor this purpose, blocks are associated with a window function that has the property that the sum of 4 overlapped windows is equal to 1 everywhere.\n\nStudies of methods for reducing the complexity of OBMC have shown that the contribution to the window function is smallest for the diagonally-adjacent block.  Reducing the weight for this contribution to zero and increasing the other weights by an equal amount leads to a substantial reduction in complexity without a large penalty in quality.  In such a scheme, each pixel then belongs to 3 blocks rather than 4, and rather than using 8 neighboring blocks, only 4 are used for each block to be compensated.  Such a scheme is found in the [[H.263]] Annex F Advanced Prediction mode\n\n== Quarter Pixel (QPel) and Half Pixel motion compensation ==\n\nIn motion compensation, quarter or half samples are actually interpolated sub-samples caused by fractional motion vectors. Based on the vectors and full-samples, the sub-samples can be calculated by using bicubic or bilinear 2-D filtering.  See subclause 8.4.2.2 \"Fractional sample interpolation process\" of the H.264 standard.\n\n== 3D image coding techniques ==\n\nMotion compensation is utilized in [[Stereoscopic Video Coding]]\n\nIn video, ''time'' is often considered as the third dimension. Still image coding techniques can be expanded to an extra dimension.\n\n[[JPEG 2000]] uses wavelets, and these can also be used to encode motion without gaps between blocks in an adaptive way. Fractional pixel [[affine transformation]]s lead to bleeding between adjacent pixels. If no higher internal resolution is used the delta images mostly fight against the image smearing out. The delta image can also be encoded as wavelets, so that the borders of the adaptive blocks match.\n\n[[2D+Delta]] Encoding techniques utilize [[H.264]] and [[MPEG-2]] compatible coding and can use motion compensation to compress between stereoscopic images.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Video coding format}}\n\nA precursor to the concept of motion compensation dates back to 1929, when R.D. Kell in Britain proposed the concept of transmitting only the portions of an [[analog video]] scene that changed from frame-to-frame. The concept of [[inter-frame]] motion compensation dates back to 1959, when [[NHK]] researchers Y. Taki, M. Hatori and S. Tanaka proposed predictive inter-frame [[video coding]] in the [[temporal dimension]].<ref name=\"ITU\">{{cite web |title=History of Video Compression |url=https://www.itu.int/wftp3/av-arch/jvt-site/2002_07_Klagenfurt/JVT-D068.doc |website=[[ITU-T]] |publisher=Joint Video Team (JVT) of ISO/IEC MPEG & ITU-T VCEG (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 and ITU-T SG16 Q.6) |date=July 2002 |pages=11, 24-9, 33, 40-1, 53-6 |accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Motion-compensated DCT===\nPractical motion-compensated [[video compression]] was made possible by the development of motion-compensated [[Discrete cosine transform|DCT]] (MC DCT) coding,<ref name=\"Lea\">{{cite book |last1=Lea |first1=William |title=Video on demand: Research Paper 94/68 |date=1994 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |location=9 May 1994 |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP94-68 |accessdate=20 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082623/https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP94-68 |archive-date=20 September 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> also called block motion compensation (BMC) or DCT motion compensation.
