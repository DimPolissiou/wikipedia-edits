He was an active executive member of the General Committee of Calcutta Brahmo Samaj since his college days. He participated in the committee's annual conferences at various locations across India, along with Brahmo leaders such as [[Keshub Chandra Sen|Kesub Chandra Sen]], [[Debendranath Tagore]], Sivanath Sastri, [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[R. G. Bhandarkar]], and others. In 1888, he obtained a medical degree with honors and entered into [[Public service|government service]]. After that, he worked as a [[medic]] in several hospitals across South India and as a medical lecturer. He also served as a magistrate during the [[British rule]] in Malabar.\n\nGopalan married Kallat Kausallyaammal on 30&nbsp;December 1894. According to the rituals involved, this was the first Brahmo wedding. Ramakrishna Gobal Bhandhakar, a Brahmo leader and social reformer at that time, conducted the wedding at the Madras Brahmo Samaj. Several Brahmo leaders presided over the wedding. Kallat Kausallyaammal was a supporter of Gopalan and assisted his social reform activities.\n\nGopalan worked as a doctor, chief surgeon, and [[Chief physician|superintendent]] at several hospitals in [[South India]], including in [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]], [[Tiruchirappalli|Tiruchirapalli]], [[Madurai]], [[Chennai]], [[Mysore]], and [[Bangalore]] ([[Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospitals]]). He returned to Kerala in 1896 and joined [[Kuthiravattam Mental Hospital|Calicut Lunatic asylum]] (now the Kuthiravattom Mental Hospital) as its first superintendent. Meanwhile, [[caste]] and [[racial discrimination]], evil practices, beliefs, and social injustices were prevalent in Kerala, and atrocities against women and children were at their peak.

A Brahmomandir was also constructed in 1928 at: Poonthoppu, Kommady, Alappuzha (now Grihalakshmi Gandhi Smaraka Seva Sangam) with the donation by a [[landlord]] ([[Jenmi]]) of Alleppey, named Mangalath Cochoumini Channar. Channar was once a strict follower of [[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]], but was later influenced by the reform activities of Gopalan and Brahmo Samaj. His daughter, Mangalath Cochoumini Mandhakinibai, spearheaded the reform activities at Alappuzha Brahmosamaj and was married to Gopalan's third son, Devadath Ayathan. This was the first Brahmo wedding conducted at Alappuzha Brahmo Samaj, which spread the custom of Misra Vivaham all over South Kerala.\n\nIn the year 1900, Gopalan initiated the Sugunavardhini Movement and began his social reform activities. Through this movement, he worked to foster human values in children, protect the rights of women, and provide free education to girls and marginalized sections of society, especially the [[Harijan]] communities in Kerala, that were then ill-treated by the higher castes, such as the [[Brahmin]]s and the [[Nair]]s. He established the Lady Chandhawarkar Elementary School intending to educate girls and the underprivileged section of society. Weekly meetings were conducted at his home, Santhi Ashram. Women, children, and people from all walks of life gathered there to share their sorrows with Gopalan and Kausallyaammal, who worked to address them. Children were offered an opportunity to showcase their talents and skills, and were appreciated during these weekly meetings. After the sad demise of Kallat Kausallyaammal, her daughter-in-law Dr. M.C. Mandhakinibai Devadath, tookl over the baton to unite women and the lower sections of the community to help them assert their social rights.\n\nUnlike the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP)]], which had been established by Narayana Guru<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sreenarayanaguru.in/|title=narayana guru|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Narayana Guru; \u1e62\u0101j\u012b, K.

He was an active executive member of the General Committee of Calcutta Brahmo Samaj since his college days.

G. Bhandarkar]], and others. In 1888, he obtained a medical degree with honors and entered into [[Public service|government service]]. After that, he worked as a [[medic]] in several hospitals across South India and as a medical lecturer. He also served as a magistrate during the [[British rule]] in Malabar.\n\nGopalan married Kallat Kausallyaammal on 30&nbsp;December 1894. According to the rituals involved, this was the first Brahmo wedding. Ramakrishna Gobal Bhandhakar, a Brahmo leader and social reformer at that time, conducted the wedding at the Madras Brahmo Samaj. Several Brahmo leaders presided over the wedding. Kallat Kausallyaammal was a supporter of Gopalan and assisted his social reform activities.\n\nGopalan worked as a doctor, chief surgeon, and [[Chief physician|superintendent]] at several hospitals in [[South India]], including in [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]], [[Tiruchirappalli|Tiruchirapalli]], [[Madurai]], [[Chennai]], [[Mysore]], and [[Bangalore]] ([[Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospitals]]). He returned to Kerala in 1896 and joined [[Kuthiravattam Mental Hospital|Calicut Lunatic asylum]] (now the Kuthiravattom Mental Hospital) as its first superintendent. Meanwhile, [[caste]] and [[racial discrimination]], evil practices, beliefs, and social injustices were prevalent in Kerala, and atrocities against women and children were at their peak.

A Brahmomandir was also constructed in 1928 at: Poonthoppu, Kommady, Alappuzha (now Grihalakshmi Gandhi Smaraka Seva Sangam) with the donation by a [[landlord]] ([[Jenmi]]) of Alleppey, named Mangalath Cochoumini Channar. Channar was once a strict follower of [[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]], but was later influenced by the reform activities of Gopalan and Brahmo Samaj. His daughter, Mangalath Cochoumini Mandhakinibai, spearheaded the reform activities at Alappuzha Brahmosamaj and was married to Gopalan's third son, Devadath Ayathan. This was the first Brahmo wedding conducted at Alappuzha Brahmo Samaj, which spread the custom of Misra Vivaham all over South Kerala.\n\nIn the year 1900, Gopalan initiated the Sugunavardhini Movement and began his social reform activities. Through this movement, he worked to foster human values in children, protect the rights of women, and provide free education to girls and marginalized sections of society, especially the [[Harijan]] communities in Kerala, that were then ill-treated by the higher castes, such as the [[Brahmin]]s and the [[Nair]]s. He established the Lady Chandhawarkar Elementary School intending to educate girls and the underprivileged section of society. Weekly meetings were conducted at his home, Santhi Ashram. Women, children, and people from all walks of life gathered there to share their sorrows with Gopalan and Kausallyaammal, who worked to address them. Children were offered an opportunity to showcase their talents and skills, and were appreciated during these weekly meetings. After the sad demise of Kallat Kausallyaammal, her daughter-in-law Dr. M.C. Mandhakinibai Devadath, tookl over the baton to unite women and the lower sections of the community to help them assert their social rights.\n\nUnlike the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP)]], which had been established by Narayana Guru<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sreenarayanaguru.in/|title=narayana guru|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Narayana Guru; \u1e62\u0101j\u012b, K.
