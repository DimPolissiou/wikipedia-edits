Such a pulse's origin may be a natural occurrence or man-made and can occur as a [[electromagnetic field|radiated]], [[electric field|electric]], or [[magnetic field]] or a conducted [[electric current]], depending on the source.\n\nEMP interference is generally disruptive or damaging to electronic equipment, and at higher energy levels a powerful EMP event such as a lightning strike can damage physical objects such as buildings and aircraft structures. The management of EMP effects is an important branch of [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) engineering.\n\nWeapons have been developed to deliver the damaging effects of high-energy EMP.\n\n== General characteristics ==\nAn electromagnetic pulse is a short burst of electromagnetic energy. Its short duration means that it will be spread over a range of frequencies. Pulses are typically characterized by:\n\n* The type of energy (radiated, electric, magnetic or conducted).\n* The range or [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of frequencies present.\n* Pulse waveform: shape, duration and amplitude.\n\nThe last two of these, the frequency spectrum and the pulse waveform, are interrelated via the [[Fourier transform]] and may be seen as two ways of describing the same pulse.\n\n=== Types of energy ===\n{{Main|Electromagnetism}}\nEMP energy may be transferred in any of four forms:\n* [[Electric field]]\n* [[Magnetic field]]\n* [[Electromagnetic radiation]]\n* [[Electrical conduction]]\n\nAccording to [[Maxwell's equations]], a pulse of electric energy will always be accompanied by a pulse of magnetic energy. In a typical pulse, either the electric or the magnetic form will dominate.\n\nIn general, radiation only acts over long distances, with the magnetic and electric fields acting over short distances. There are a few exceptions, such as a [[solar flare|solar magnetic flare]].\n\n=== Frequency ranges ===\nA pulse of electromagnetic energy typically comprises many frequencies from very low to some upper limit depending on the source. The range defined as EMP, sometimes referred to as \"DC to daylight\", excludes the highest frequencies comprising the optical (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) and ionizing (X and gamma rays) ranges.\n\nSome types of EMP events can leave an optical trail, such as lightning and sparks, but these are side effects of the current flow through the air and are not part of the EMP itself.\n\n=== Pulse waveforms ===\nThe waveform of a pulse describes how its instantaneous amplitude (field strength or current) changes over time. Real pulses tend to be quite complicated, so simplified models are often used. Such a model is typically described either in a diagram or as a mathematical equation.\n\n{|  style=\"margin:0.5em auto 0.5em auto; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=4\n|-\n| [[File:rectangular pulse.svg|200px|alt=\" \"]]<br>Rectangular pulse\n| [[File:double exponential.svg|200px|alt=\" \"]]<br>Double exponential pulse\n| [[File:damped sinewave.svg|200px|alt=\" \"]]<br>Damped sinewave pulse\n|}\n\nMost electromagnetic pulses have a very sharp leading edge, building up quickly to their maximum level. The classic model is a double-exponential curve which climbs steeply, quickly reaches a peak and then decays more slowly. However, pulses from a controlled switching circuit often approximate the form of a rectangular or \"square\" pulse.\n\nEMP events usually induce a corresponding signal in the surrounding environment or material. Coupling usually occurs most strongly over a relatively narrow frequency band, leading to a characteristic [[damped sine wave]]. Visually it is shown as a high frequency sine wave growing and decaying within the longer-lived envelope of the double-exponential curve. A damped sinewave typically has much lower energy and a narrower frequency spread than the original pulse, due to the transfer characteristic of the coupling mode. In practice, EMP test equipment often injects these damped sinewaves directly rather than attempting to recreate the high-energy threat pulses.\n\nIn a pulse train, such as from a digital clock circuit, the waveform is repeated at regular intervals. A single complete pulse cycle is sufficient to characterise such a regular, repetitive train.\n\n== Types ==\nAn EMP arises where the source emits a short-duration pulse of energy. The energy is usually broadband by nature, although it often excites a relatively narrow-band ''[[damped sine wave]]'' response in the surrounding environment. Some types are generated as repetitive and regular ''[[Voltage spike|pulse]] trains''.\n\nDifferent types of EMP arise from natural, man-made, and weapons effects.\n\nTypes of natural EMP event includes:\n\n* [[Lightning]] electromagnetic pulse (LEMP). The discharge is typically an initial huge current flow, at least mega-amps, followed by a train of pulses of decreasing energy.\n* [[Electrostatic discharge]] (ESD), as a result of two charged objects coming into close proximity or even contact. \n* Meteoric EMP. The discharge of electromagnetic energy resulting from either the impact of a [[meteoroid]] with a spacecraft or the explosive breakup of a meteoroid passing through the Earth's atmosphere.<ref>{{cite journal |first=S. |last=Close |first2=P. |last2=Colestock |first3=L. |last3=Cox |first4=M. |last4=Kelley |first5=N. |last5=Lee |title=Electromagnetic pulses generated by meteoroid impacts on spacecraft |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=115 |issue=A12 |page=A12328 |year=2010 |doi=10.1029/2010JA015921 |bibcode=2010JGRA..11512328C }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Charles |last=Chandler |title=Meteoric Airbursts: General Principles |publisher=QDL blog |url=http://qdl.scs-inc.us/2ndParty/Pages/7793.html |accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Coronal mass ejection]] (CME), sometimes referred to as a solar EMP.

These can be up to several kilovolts, enough to damage electronic equipment that is insufficiently protected.\n\nTypes of military EMP include:\n\n* [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] (NEMP), as a result of a nuclear explosion. A variant of this is the high altitude nuclear EMP (HEMP), which produces a secondary pulse due to particle interactions with the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and magnetic field.\n* Non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP) weapons.\n\n=== Lightning ===\n{{Main|Lightning}}\nLightning is unusual in that it typically has a preliminary \"leader\" discharge of low energy building up to the main pulse, which in turn may be followed at intervals by several smaller bursts.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.lightning.ece.ufl.edu/PDF/Howard%20et%20al%20%5B2011%5Da.pdf |format=PDF |title=Measured close lightning leader step electric field derivative waveforms |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=116 |issue=D8 |pages=D08201 |year=2011 |doi=10.1029/2010JD015249|bibcode=2011JGRD..116.8201H  | last1 = Howard | first1 = J. | last2 = Uman | first2 = M.

ESD is treated as a small, localised phenomenon, although technically a lightning flash is a very large ESD event. ESD can also be man-made, as in the shock received from a [[Van de Graaff generator]].\n\nAn ESD event can damage electronic circuitry by injecting a high-voltage pulse, besides giving people an unpleasant shock. Such an ESD event can also create sparks, which may in turn ignite fires or fuel-vapour explosions. For this reason, before refuelling an aircraft or exposing any fuel vapour to the air, the fuel nozzle is first connected to the aircraft to safely discharge any static.\n\n=== Switching pulses ===\nThe switching action of an electrical circuit creates a sharp change in the flow of electricity. This sharp change is a form of EMP.\n\nSimple electrical sources include inductive loads such as relays, solenoids, and the brush contacts in electric motors. Typically these send a pulse down any electrical connections present, as well as radiating a pulse of energy. The amplitude is usually small and the signal may be treated as \"noise\" or \"interference\". The switching off or \"opening\" of a circuit causes an abrupt change in the current flowing. This can in turn cause a large pulse in the electric field across the open contacts, causing arcing and damage. It is often necessary to incorporate design features to limit such effects.\n\nElectronic devices such as vacuum tubes or valves, transistors and diodes can also switch on and off very quickly, causing similar issues. One-off pulses may be caused by solid-state switches and other devices used only occasionally.  However, the many millions of transistors in a modern computer may switch repeatedly at frequencies above 1&nbsp;GHz, causing interference which appears to be continuous.\n\n=== Nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) ===\n{{Main|Nuclear electromagnetic pulse}}\n\nA nuclear electromagnetic pulse is the abrupt pulse of electromagnetic radiation resulting from a [[nuclear explosion]]. The resulting rapidly changing [[electric field]]s and magnetic fields may couple with electrical/electronic systems to produce damaging current and [[voltage spike|voltage surges]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21728664-north-korea-has-given-electricity-industry-jolt-fear-americas-utilities-prepare|title=America\u2019s utilities prepare for a nuclear threat to the grid|work=[[The Economist]]|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe intense [[gamma radiation]] emitted can also ionize the surrounding air, creating a secondary EMP as the atoms of air first lose their electrons and then regain them.\n\n[[Nuclear EMP|NEMP]] weapons are designed to maximize such EMP effects as the primary damage mechanism, and some are capable of destroying susceptible electronic equipment over a wide area.\n\nA high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) weapon is a NEMP warhead designed to be detonated far above the Earth's surface. The explosion releases a blast of gamma rays into the mid-[[stratosphere]], which ionizes as a secondary effect and the resultant energetic free electrons interact with the Earth's magnetic field to produce a much stronger EMP than is normally produced in the denser air at lower altitudes.\n\n=== Non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP) ===\nNon-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP) is a weapon-generated electromagnetic pulse without use of nuclear technology. Devices that can achieve this objective include a large low-inductance [[capacitor]] bank discharged into a single-loop antenna, a microwave generator, and an [[explosively pumped flux compression generator]]. To achieve the frequency characteristics of the pulse needed for optimal [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]] into the target, [[Electromagnetic wave|wave]]-shaping circuits or microwave generators are added between the pulse source and the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. [[Vircator]]s are vacuum tubes that are particularly suitable for microwave conversion of high-energy pulses.<ref name=kopp>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA332511  |title=The Electromagnetic Bomb - A Weapon of Electrical Mass Destruction |date=October 1996 |last=Kopp |first=Carlo |author-link=Carlo Kopp |journal=USAF CADRE Air Chronicles |id=DTIC:ADA332511 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nNNEMP generators can be carried as a payload of bombs, [[cruise missile]]s (such as the [[Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project|CHAMP]] missile) and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], with diminished mechanical, thermal and ionizing radiation effects, but without the consequences of deploying nuclear weapons.\n\nThe range of NNEMP weapons is much less than nuclear EMP. Nearly all NNEMP devices used as weapons require chemical explosives as their initial energy source, producing only 10<sup>\u22126</sup> (one millionth) the energy of nuclear explosives of similar weight.{{sfn|Glasstone|Dolan|1977|loc=Chapter 1}} The electromagnetic pulse from NNEMP weapons must come from within the weapon, while nuclear weapons generate EMP as a secondary effect.{{sfn|Glasstone|Dolan|1977|loc=Chapter 11, section 11.73}} These facts limit the range of NNEMP weapons, but allow finer target discrimination.

For example, a common problem in the mid-twentieth century was interference emitted by the ignition systems of gasoline engines, which caused radio sets to crackle and TV sets to show stripes on the screen. Laws were introduced to make vehicle manufacturers fit interference suppressors.\n\nAt a high voltage level an EMP can induce a spark, for example from an electrostatic discharge when fuelling a gasoline-engined vehicle. Such sparks have been known to cause fuel-air explosions and precautions must be taken to prevent them.<ref>\"Fundamentals of Electrostatic Discharge\", Compliance Magazine, 1 May 2015. Retrieved 25 June 2015.</ref>\n\nA large and energetic EMP can induce high currents and voltages in the victim unit, temporarily disrupting its function or even permanently damaging it.\n\nA powerful EMP can also directly affect magnetic materials and corrupt the data stored on media such as [[magnetic tape]] and computer [[hard drive]]s. Hard drives are usually shielded by heavy metal casings. Some [[IT asset management|IT asset disposition]] service providers and computer recyclers use a controlled EMP to wipe such magnetic media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/shredding/hard_drives/how_to_permanently_delete_data.html#data_wipe|title=EMP Data Wipe|author=<!-- not stated -->|publisher=Newtech although Recycling|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> but emp's are banned and will never happen again and also visit vle.mathswatch.com\n\nA very large EMP event such as a lightning strike is also capable of damaging objects such as trees, buildings and aircraft directly, either through heating effects or the disruptive effects of the very large magnetic field generated by the current. An indirect effect can be electrical fires caused by heating. Most engineered structures and systems require some form of protection against lightning to be designed in.\n\nThe damaging effects of high-energy EMP have led to the introduction of EMP weapons, from tactical missiles with a small radius of effect to nuclear bombs tailored for maximum EMP effect over a wide area.\n\n== Control ==\n{{main|Electromagnetic compatibility}}\n[[File:E-4 advanced airborne command post EMP sim.jpg|thumb|EMP simulator HAGII-C testing a [[Boeing E-4]] aircraft.]]\n[[File:USS Estocin FFG-15 moored near EMPRESS I.jpg|thumb|EMPRESS I (antennas along shoreline) with {{USS|Estocin|FFG-15}} moored in the foreground for testing.]]\nLike any [[electromagnetic interference]], the threat from EMP is subject to control measures. This is true whether the threat is natural or man-made.\n\nTherefore, most control measures focus on the susceptibility of equipment to EMP effects, and [[radiation hardening|hardening]] or protecting it from harm. Man-made sources, other than weapons, are also subject to control measures in order to limit the amount of pulse energy emitted.\n\nThe discipline of ensuring correct equipment operation in the presence of EMP and other RF threats is known as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).\n\n=== Test simulation ===\nTo test the effects of EMP on engineered systems and equipment, an EMP simulator may be used.\n\n==== Induced pulse simulation ====\nInduced pulses are of much lower energy than threat pulses and so are more practicable to create, but they are less predictable. A common test technique is to use a [[current clamp]] in reverse, to inject a range of damped sine wave signals into a cable connected to the equipment under test. The damped sine wave generator is able to reproduce the range of induced signals likely to occur.\n\n==== Threat pulse simulation ====\nSometimes the threat pulse itself is simulated in a repeatable way. The pulse may be reproduced at low energy in order to characterise the victim's response prior to damped sinewave injection, or at high energy to recreate the actual threat conditions.\n\nA small-scale [[Electrostatic discharge#Simulation and testing for electronic devices|ESD simulator]] may be hand-held.\n\nBench- or room-sized simulators come in a range of designs, depending on the type and level of threat to be generated.\n\nAt the top end of the scale, large outdoor test facilities incorporating high-energy EMP simulators have been built by several countries.<ref name=baum1/><ref name=baum2/> The largest facilities are able to test whole vehicles including ships and aircraft for their susceptibility to EMP.

These can be up to several kilovolts, enough to damage electronic equipment that is insufficiently protected.\n\nTypes of military EMP include:\n\n* [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] (NEMP), as a result of a nuclear explosion.

ESD is treated as a small, localised phenomenon, although technically a lightning flash is a very large ESD event. ESD can also be man-made, as in the shock received from a [[Van de Graaff generator]].\n\nAn ESD event can damage electronic circuitry by injecting a high-voltage pulse, besides giving people an unpleasant shock. Such an ESD event can also create sparks, which may in turn ignite fires or fuel-vapour explosions. For this reason, before refuelling an aircraft or exposing any fuel vapour to the air, the fuel nozzle is first connected to the aircraft to safely discharge any static.\n\n=== Switching pulses ===\nThe switching action of an electrical circuit creates a sharp change in the flow of electricity. This sharp change is a form of EMP.\n\nSimple electrical sources include inductive loads such as relays, solenoids, and the brush contacts in electric motors. Typically these send a pulse down any electrical connections present, as well as radiating a pulse of energy. The amplitude is usually small and the signal may be treated as \"noise\" or \"interference\". The switching off or \"opening\" of a circuit causes an abrupt change in the current flowing. This can in turn cause a large pulse in the electric field across the open contacts, causing arcing and damage. It is often necessary to incorporate design features to limit such effects.\n\nElectronic devices such as vacuum tubes or valves, transistors and diodes can also switch on and off very quickly, causing similar issues. One-off pulses may be caused by solid-state switches and other devices used only occasionally.  However, the many millions of transistors in a modern computer may switch repeatedly at frequencies above 1&nbsp;GHz, causing interference which appears to be continuous.\n\n=== Nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) ===\n{{Main|Nuclear electromagnetic pulse}}\n\nA nuclear electromagnetic pulse is the abrupt pulse of electromagnetic radiation resulting from a [[nuclear explosion]]. The resulting rapidly changing [[electric field]]s and magnetic fields may couple with electrical/electronic systems to produce damaging current and [[voltage spike|voltage surges]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21728664-north-korea-has-given-electricity-industry-jolt-fear-americas-utilities-prepare|title=America\u2019s utilities prepare for a nuclear threat to the grid|work=[[The Economist]]|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe intense [[gamma radiation]] emitted can also ionize the surrounding air, creating a secondary EMP as the atoms of air first lose their electrons and then regain them.\n\n[[Nuclear EMP|NEMP]] weapons are designed to maximize such EMP effects as the primary damage mechanism, and some are capable of destroying susceptible electronic equipment over a wide area.\n\nA high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) weapon is a NEMP warhead designed to be detonated far above the Earth's surface. The explosion releases a blast of gamma rays into the mid-[[stratosphere]], which ionizes as a secondary effect and the resultant energetic free electrons interact with the Earth's magnetic field to produce a much stronger EMP than is normally produced in the denser air at lower altitudes.\n\n=== Non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP) ===\nNon-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP) is a weapon-generated electromagnetic pulse without use of nuclear technology. Devices that can achieve this objective include a large low-inductance [[capacitor]] bank discharged into a single-loop antenna, a microwave generator, and an [[explosively pumped flux compression generator]]. To achieve the frequency characteristics of the pulse needed for optimal [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]] into the target, [[Electromagnetic wave|wave]]-shaping circuits or microwave generators are added between the pulse source and the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. [[Vircator]]s are vacuum tubes that are particularly suitable for microwave conversion of high-energy pulses.<ref name=kopp>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA332511  |title=The Electromagnetic Bomb - A Weapon of Electrical Mass Destruction |date=October 1996 |last=Kopp |first=Carlo |author-link=Carlo Kopp |journal=USAF CADRE Air Chronicles |id=DTIC:ADA332511 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nNNEMP generators can be carried as a payload of bombs, [[cruise missile]]s (such as the [[Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project|CHAMP]] missile) and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], with diminished mechanical, thermal and ionizing radiation effects, but without the consequences of deploying nuclear weapons.\n\nThe range of NNEMP weapons is much less than nuclear EMP. Nearly all NNEMP devices used as weapons require chemical explosives as their initial energy source, producing only 10<sup>\u22126</sup> (one millionth) the energy of nuclear explosives of similar weight.{{sfn|Glasstone|Dolan|1977|loc=Chapter 1}} The electromagnetic pulse from NNEMP weapons must come from within the weapon, while nuclear weapons generate EMP as a secondary effect.{{sfn|Glasstone|Dolan|1977|loc=Chapter 11, section 11.73}} These facts limit the range of NNEMP weapons, but allow finer target discrimination.

For example, a common problem in the mid-twentieth century was interference emitted by the ignition systems of gasoline engines, which caused radio sets to crackle and TV sets to show stripes on the screen. Laws were introduced to make vehicle manufacturers fit interference suppressors.\n\nAt a high voltage level an EMP can induce a spark, for example from an electrostatic discharge when fuelling a gasoline-engined vehicle. Such sparks have been known to cause fuel-air explosions and precautions must be taken to prevent them.<ref>\"Fundamentals of Electrostatic Discharge\", Compliance Magazine, 1 May 2015. Retrieved 25 June 2015.</ref>\n\nA large and energetic EMP can induce high currents and voltages in the victim unit, temporarily disrupting its function or even permanently damaging it.\n\nA powerful EMP can also directly affect magnetic materials and corrupt the data stored on media such as [[magnetic tape]] and computer [[hard drive]]s. Hard drives are usually shielded by heavy metal casings. Some [[IT asset management|IT asset disposition]] service providers and computer recyclers use a controlled EMP to wipe such magnetic media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/shredding/hard_drives/how_to_permanently_delete_data.html#data_wipe|title=EMP Data Wipe|author=<!-- not stated -->|publisher=Newtech Recycling|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>\n\nA very large EMP event such as a lightning strike is also capable of damaging objects such as trees, buildings and aircraft directly, either through heating effects or the disruptive effects of the very large magnetic field generated by the current. An indirect effect can be electrical fires caused by heating. Most engineered structures and systems require some form of protection against lightning to be designed in.\n\nThe damaging effects of high-energy EMP have led to the introduction of EMP weapons, from tactical missiles with a small radius of effect to nuclear bombs tailored for maximum EMP effect over a wide area.\n\n== Control ==\n{{main|Electromagnetic compatibility}}\n[[File:E-4 advanced airborne command post EMP sim.jpg|thumb|EMP simulator HAGII-C testing a [[Boeing E-4]] aircraft.]]\n[[File:USS Estocin FFG-15 moored near EMPRESS I.jpg|thumb|EMPRESS I (antennas along shoreline) with {{USS|Estocin|FFG-15}} moored in the foreground for testing.]]\nLike any [[electromagnetic interference]], the threat from EMP is subject to control measures. This is true whether the threat is natural or man-made.\n\nTherefore, most control measures focus on the susceptibility of equipment to EMP effects, and [[radiation hardening|hardening]] or protecting it from harm. Man-made sources, other than weapons, are also subject to control measures in order to limit the amount of pulse energy emitted.\n\nThe discipline of ensuring correct equipment operation in the presence of EMP and other RF threats is known as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).\n\n=== Test simulation ===\nTo test the effects of EMP on engineered systems and equipment, an EMP simulator may be used.\n\n==== Induced pulse simulation ====\nInduced pulses are of much lower energy than threat pulses and so are more practicable to create, but they are less predictable. A common test technique is to use a [[current clamp]] in reverse, to inject a range of damped sine wave signals into a cable connected to the equipment under test. The damped sine wave generator is able to reproduce the range of induced signals likely to occur.\n\n==== Threat pulse simulation ====\nSometimes the threat pulse itself is simulated in a repeatable way. The pulse may be reproduced at low energy in order to characterise the victim's response prior to damped sinewave injection, or at high energy to recreate the actual threat conditions.\n\nA small-scale [[Electrostatic discharge#Simulation and testing for electronic devices|ESD simulator]] may be hand-held.\n\nBench- or room-sized simulators come in a range of designs, depending on the type and level of threat to be generated.\n\nAt the top end of the scale, large outdoor test facilities incorporating high-energy EMP simulators have been built by several countries.<ref name=baum1/><ref name=baum2/> The largest facilities are able to test whole vehicles including ships and aircraft for their susceptibility to EMP.

In such circumstances, direct contact with a live electrical conductor should be avoided. Where this occurs, such as when touching a [[Van de Graaf generator]] or other highly-charged object, care must be taken to release the object and then discharge the body through a high resistance, in order to avoid the risk of a harmful shock pulse when stepping away.\n\nVery high electric field strengths can cause breakdown of the air and a potentially lethal arc current similar to lightning to flow, but electric field strengths of up to 200 kV/m are regarded as safe.<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/i6055_11.pdf \"Protecting Personnel from Electromagnetic Fields\"], US Department of Defence Instruction No. 6055.11, 19 August 2009.</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n{{Main|Electromagnetic pulse in fiction and popular culture}}\n\nThe popular media often depict EMP effects incorrectly, causing misunderstandings among the public and even professionals.

He received his doctoral degree at Freiburg with a dissertation on [[Martin Heidegger]] in 1994.\n\nIn 2000, he joined the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Basel]], where he completed his ''[[Habilitation]]''. In 2010 he became a faculty member at the [[Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design]], where his areas of interest were philosophy of the 18th, 19th and 20th century, [[ethics]], [[social philosophy]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[cultural theory]], [[aesthetics]], [[religion]], [[media theory]], and [[intercultural philosophy]]. Since 2012 he has taught [[philosophy]] and [[cultural studies]] at the [[Universit\u00e4t der K\u00fcnste Berlin]] (UdK), where he directs the newly established ''Studium Generale'' general-studies program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Studium Generale|url=http://www.udk-berlin.de/sites/content/themen/universitaet/studium_generale/index_ger.html}}</ref>\n\nHan is the author of sixteen books, of which the most recent are treatises on what he terms a \"society of tiredness\" (''M\u00fcdigkeitsgesellschaft''), a \"society of transparency\" (''Transparenzgesellschaft''), and on his [[Neologism|neologist]] concept of ''shanzhai'', which seeks to identify modes of [[deconstruction]] in contemporary practices of Chinese capitalism.\n\nHan's current work focuses on [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] as a cultural norm created by [[neoliberal]] market forces, which he understands as the insatiable drive toward voluntary disclosure bordering on the pornographic. According to Han, the dictates of transparency enforce a totalitarian system of openness at the expense of other social values such as shame, secrecy, and trust.<ref>{{cite web|title=Klarheit schaffen|url=http://www.freitag.de/kultur/1223-klarheit-schaffen|work=der Freitag|date=2012-06-07|accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>\n\nUntil recently, he refused to give radio and television interviews and rarely divulges any biographical or personal details, including his date of birth, in public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Play more and work less: A visit with Byung-Chul Han in Karlsruhe|url=http://www.signandsight.com/features/2156.html|work=Sign and Sight|date=2011-07-25|accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>\n\n==Thought==\n\nMuch of Han's writing is characterised by an underlying concern with the situation encountered by human subjects in the fast-paced, technologically-driven state of [[late capitalism]]. The situation is explored in its various facets through his books: sexuality, mental health (particularly [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]), violence, freedom, technology, and popular culture.\n\nIn \"The Burnout Society\" (original German title: ''\"M\u00fcdigkeitsgesellschaft\"''), Han characterizes today's society as a pathological landscape of neuronal disorders such as [[Depression (clinical)|depression]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline personality]] and [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]]. He claims that they are not \"infections\" but \"infarcts\", which are not caused by the [[Positivity/negativity ratio|negativity]] of people's immunology, but by an excess of [[Positivity/negativity ratio|positivity]].<ref>{{cite news|title='\uc0c8 \ub300\ud1b5\ub839\uc5d0\uac8c \uc120\ubb3c\ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc740 \ucc45' 1\uc704 \ucca0\ud559\uc790 \ud55c\ubcd1\ucca0\uc758 '\ud53c\ub85c\uc0ac\ud68c'|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201211292144335&code=960205|newspaper=[[Kyunghyang Shinmun]]|date=2012-11-29|access-date=2013-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203214315/http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201211292144335&code=960205|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to Han, driven by the demand to persevere and not to fail, as well as by the ambition of efficiency, we become committers and sacrificers at the same time and enter a swirl of demarcation, self-exploitation and collapse. \"When production is immaterial, everyone already owns the means of production him- or herself. The neoliberal system is no longer a class system in the proper sense. It does not consist of classes that display mutual antagonism. This is what accounts for the system's stability.\"<ref>Han, \"Psychopolitics\" (2017), p. 13</ref> Han argues that subjects become self-exploiters: \"Today, everyone is an ''auto-exploiting labourer in his or her own enterprise.'' People are now master and slave in one. Even class struggle has transformed into an ''inner struggle against oneself''.\"<ref>Han, \"Psychopolitics\" (2017), p. 13</ref> The individual has become what Han calls \"the achievement-subject\"; the individual does not believe they are subjugated \"subjects\" but rather \"''projects'': Always refashioning and reinventing ourselves\" which \"amounts to a form of compulsion and constraint - indeed, to a ''more efficient kind of subjectivation and subjugation.'' As a project deeming itself free of external and alien limitations, the ''I'' is now subjugating itself to internal limitations and self-constraints, which are taking the form of compulsive achievement and optimization.\"<ref>Han, \"Psychopolitics\" (2017), p. 21</ref>\n\n''\"Agonie des Eros\"'' (\"Agony of the Eros\") carries forward Han's thoughts, which he developed in his earlier books \"The Burnout Society\" ({{lang-de|M\u00fcdigkeitsgesellschaft}}) and \"Transparency Society\" ({{lang-de|Transparenzgesellschaft}}), and synthesises the two earlier works into an interrogation of desire and love between humans. Based on an analysis of the characters in Lars von Trier's film \"[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]\", in which Han sees depicted depression and overcoming, he develops the image of a society that is increasingly dominated by narcissism and self-reference. Han's diagnosis extends even to the point of the loss of desire, the disappearance of the ability to devote to \"the other\", the stranger, the non-self. At this point, subjects come to revolve exclusively around themselves, unable to build relationships. Even love and sexuality are permeated by this social change: sex and pornography, exhibition/voyeurism and re/presentation are displacing love, eroticism and desire from the public eye. The abundance of positivity and self-reference leads to a loss of confrontation. Thinking, Han states, is based on the \"untreaded\", on the desire for something that one does not yet understand. It is connected to a high degree with Eros, so the \"agony of the Eros\" is also an \"agony of thought\". Not everything must be understood and \"liked\", not everything must be made available.\n\nIn ''\"Topologie der Gewalt\"'' (\"Topology of Violence\"), Han continues his analysis of a society on the edge of collapse that he started with \"The Burnout Society\". Focusing on the relation between [[violence]] and individuality, he shows that, against the widespread thesis about its disappearance, violence has only changed its form of appearance and now operates more subtly. The material form of violence gives way to a more anonymous, desubjectified, systemic one, that does not reveal itself, as it is merging with its antagonist \u2013 freedom. This theme is further explored in \"Psychopolitics\", where through [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Richard Sennett]], [[Ren\u00e9 Girard]], [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Deleuze and Guattari|Deleuze/Guattari]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Michel Serres]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], Han develops an original conception of violence. Central to Han's thesis is the idea that violence finds expression in 'negative' and 'positive' forms (note: these are not normative judgements about the expressions themselves): negative violence is an overtly physical manifestation of violence, finding expression in war, torture, terrorism, etc; positive violence \"manifests itself as over-achievement, over-production, over-communication, hyper-attention, and hyperactivity. The violence of positivity, Han warns, could be even more disastrous than that of negativity. Infection, invasion, and infiltration have given way to [[infarction]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/topology-violence|title=Topology of Violence|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=The MIT Press|language=en|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nHan has written on topics such as [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]], [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]], [[Depression (clinical)|depression]], [[Fatigue (physical)|exhaustion]], [[internet]], [[love]], [[popular culture|pop culture]], [[Power (social and political)|power]], [[rationality]], [[religion]], [[social media]], [[subjectivity]], [[tiredness]], [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[violence]].\n\n==Reception==\n''\"M\u00fcdigkeitsgesellschaft\"'' will soon be available in 11 languages.<ref>{{cite web|title=Translations|url=http://www.matthes-seitz-berlin.de/foreign-rights.html}}</ref> Several South Korean newspapers voted it to be the most important book in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=2012\ub144 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uc120\uc815 \uc62c\ud574\uc758 \ucc45|trans-title=2012 Media Picks for Book of the Year|url=http://www.aladin.co.kr/events/wevent_book.aspx?pn=2012_media|publisher=Aladin Books|access-date=30 May 2018}}</ref> [[The Guardian]] wrote a positive review of his 2017 book \"Psychopolitics: Neoliberalism and New Technologies of Power\",<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/30/psychopolitics-neolberalism-new-technologies-byung-chul-han-review|title=Psychopolitics: Neoliberalism and New Technologies of Power by Byung-Chul Han \u2013 review|last=Jeffries|first=Stuart|date=2017-12-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> while the Hong Kong Review of Books praised his writing as \"concise almost to the point of being aphoristic, Han's writing style manages to distil complex ideas into highly readable and persuasive prose\" while noting that \"on other occasions, Han veers uncomfortably close to billboard-sized statements ('Neoliberalism is the ''capitalism of'' ''Like'' '), which highlights the fine line between cleverness and self-indulgent sloganeering.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hkrbooks.com/2018/05/16/psychopolitics/|title=Psychopolitics|last=Hamilton|date=2018-05-16|website=HONG KONG REVIEW OF BOOKS  \u9999\u6e2f\u66f8\u8a55|language=en|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> The LA Book Review described him as \"as good a candidate as any for philosopher of the moment.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/media-and-transparency-an-introduction-to-byung-chul-han-in-english/|title=Media and Transparency: An Introduction to Byung-Chul Han in English|last=West|first=Adrian Nathan|website=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>\n\n== Works in English ==\n\n* ''The Burnout Society'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2015) {{ISBN|9780804795098}}.\n* ''The Transparency Society'' (Stanford: Stanford Briefs, 2015) {{ISBN|080479460X}}\n* ''Psychopolitics: Neoliberalism and New Technologies of Power'' (London & New York: Verso Books, 2017) {{ISBN|9781784785772}}\n* ''The Scent of Time: A Philosophical Essay on the Art of Lingering'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2017) {{ISBN|1509516050}}\n* ''The Agony of Eros'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2017) {{ISBN|0262533375}}\n* ''In the Swarm: Digital Prospects'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2017), {{ISBN|0262533367}}\n* ''Shanzhai: Deconstruction in Chinese'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2017) {{ISBN|0262534363}}\n* ''Saving Beauty'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2017) {{ISBN|9781509515103}}\n* ''The Expulsion of the Other: Society, Perception and Communication Today'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2018) {{ISBN|1509523065}}\n* ''Topology of Violence'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2018) {{ISBN|9780262534956}}\n* ''What Is Power?''

He received his doctoral degree at Freiburg with a dissertation on [[Martin Heidegger]] in 1994.\n\nIn 2000, he joined the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Basel]], where he completed his ''[[Habilitation]]''. In 2010 he became a faculty member at the [[Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design]], where his areas of interest were philosophy of the 18th, 19th and 20th century, [[ethics]], [[social philosophy]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[cultural theory]], [[aesthetics]], [[religion]], [[media theory]], and [[intercultural philosophy]]. Since 2012 he has taught [[philosophy]] and [[cultural studies]] at the [[Universit\u00e4t der K\u00fcnste Berlin]] (UdK), where he directs the newly established ''Studium Generale'' general-studies program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Studium Generale|url=http://www.udk-berlin.de/sites/content/themen/universitaet/studium_generale/index_ger.html}}</ref>\n\nHan is the author of sixteen books, of which the most recent are treatises on what he terms a \"society of tiredness\" (''M\u00fcdigkeitsgesellschaft''), a \"society of transparency\" (''Transparenzgesellschaft''), and on his [[Neologism|neologist]] concept of ''shanzhai'', which seeks to identify modes of [[deconstruction]] in contemporary practices of Chinese capitalism.\n\nHan's current work focuses on [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] as a cultural norm created by [[neoliberal]] market forces, which he understands as the insatiable drive toward voluntary disclosure bordering on the pornographic. According to Han, the dictates of transparency enforce a totalitarian system of openness at the expense of other social values such as shame, secrecy, and trust.<ref>{{cite web|title=Klarheit schaffen|url=http://www.freitag.de/kultur/1223-klarheit-schaffen|work=der Freitag|date=2012-06-07|accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>\n\nUntil recently, he refused to give radio and television interviews and rarely divulges any biographical or personal details, including his date of birth, in public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Play more and work less: A visit with Byung-Chul Han in Karlsruhe|url=http://www.signandsight.com/features/2156.html|work=Sign and Sight|date=2011-07-25|accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>\n\n==Thought==\n\nMuch of Han's writing is characterised by an underlying concern with the situation encountered by human subjects in the fast-paced, technologically-driven state of [[late capitalism]]. The situation is explored in its various facets through his books: sexuality, mental health (particularly [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]), violence, freedom, technology, and popular culture.\n\nIn \"The Burnout Society\" (original German title: ''\"M\u00fcdigkeitsgesellschaft\"''), Han characterizes today's society as a pathological landscape of neuronal disorders such as [[Depression (clinical)|depression]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline personality]] and [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]]. He claims that they are not \"infections\" but \"infarcts\", which are not caused by the [[Positivity/negativity ratio|negativity]] of people's immunology, but by an excess of [[Positivity/negativity ratio|positivity]].<ref>{{cite news|title='\uc0c8 \ub300\ud1b5\ub839\uc5d0\uac8c \uc120\ubb3c\ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc740 \ucc45' 1\uc704 \ucca0\ud559\uc790 \ud55c\ubcd1\ucca0\uc758 '\ud53c\ub85c\uc0ac\ud68c'|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201211292144335&code=960205|newspaper=[[Kyunghyang Shinmun]]|date=2012-11-29|access-date=2013-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203214315/http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201211292144335&code=960205|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to Han, driven by the demand to persevere and not to fail, as well as by the ambition of efficiency, we become committers and sacrificers at the same time and enter a swirl of demarcation, self-exploitation and collapse. \"When production is immaterial, everyone already owns the means of production him- or herself. The neoliberal system is no longer a class system in the proper sense. It does not consist of classes that display mutual antagonism. This is what accounts for the system's stability.\"<ref>Han, \"Psychopolitics\" (2017), p. 13</ref> Han argues that subjects become self-exploiters: \"Today, everyone is an ''auto-exploiting labourer in his or her own enterprise.'' People are now master and slave in one. Even class struggle has transformed into an ''inner struggle against oneself''.\"<ref>Han, \"Psychopolitics\" (2017), p. 13</ref> The individual has become what Han calls \"the achievement-subject\"; the individual does not believe they are subjugated \"subjects\" but rather \"''projects'': Always refashioning and reinventing ourselves\" which \"amounts to a form of compulsion and constraint - indeed, to a ''more efficient kind of subjectivation and subjugation.'' As a project deeming itself free of external and alien limitations, the ''I'' is now subjugating itself to internal limitations and self-constraints, which are taking the form of compulsive achievement and optimization.\"<ref>Han, \"Psychopolitics\" (2017), p. 21</ref>\n\n''\"Agonie des Eros\"'' (\"Agony of the Eros\") carries forward Han's thoughts, which he developed in his earlier books \"The Burnout Society\" ({{lang-de|M\u00fcdigkeitsgesellschaft}}) and \"Transparency Society\" ({{lang-de|Transparenzgesellschaft}}), and synthesises the two earlier works into an interrogation of desire and love between humans. Based on an analysis of the characters in Lars von Trier's film \"[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]\", in which Han sees depicted depression and overcoming, he develops the image of a society that is increasingly dominated by narcissism and self-reference. Han's diagnosis extends even to the point of the loss of desire, the disappearance of the ability to devote to \"the other\", the stranger, the non-self. At this point, subjects come to revolve exclusively around themselves, unable to build relationships. Even love and sexuality are permeated by this social change: sex and pornography, exhibition/voyeurism and re/presentation are displacing love, eroticism and desire from the public eye. The abundance of positivity and self-reference leads to a loss of confrontation. Thinking, Han states, is based on the \"untreaded\", on the desire for something that one does not yet understand. It is connected to a high degree with Eros, so the \"agony of the Eros\" is also an \"agony of thought\". Not everything must be understood and \"liked\", not everything must be made available.\n\nIn ''\"Topologie der Gewalt\"'' (\"Topology of Violence\"), Han continues his analysis of a society on the edge of collapse that he started with \"The Burnout Society\". Focusing on the relation between [[violence]] and individuality, he shows that, against the widespread thesis about its disappearance, violence has only changed its form of appearance and now operates more subtly. The material form of violence gives way to a more anonymous, desubjectified, systemic one, that does not reveal itself, as it is merging with its antagonist \u2013 freedom. This theme is further explored in \"Psychopolitics\", where through [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Richard Sennett]], [[Ren\u00e9 Girard]], [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Deleuze and Guattari|Deleuze/Guattari]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Michel Serres]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], Han develops an original conception of violence. Central to Han's thesis is the idea that violence finds expression in 'negative' and 'positive' forms (note: these are not normative judgements about the expressions themselves): negative violence is an overtly physical manifestation of violence, finding expression in war, torture, terrorism, etc; positive violence \"manifests itself as over-achievement, over-production, over-communication, hyper-attention, and hyperactivity. The violence of positivity, Han warns, could be even more disastrous than that of negativity. Infection, invasion, and infiltration have given way to [[infarction]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/topology-violence|title=Topology of Violence|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=The MIT Press|language=en|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nHan has written on topics such as [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]], [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]], [[Depression (clinical)|depression]], [[Fatigue (physical)|exhaustion]], [[internet]], [[love]], [[popular culture|pop culture]], [[Power (social and political)|power]], [[rationality]], [[religion]], [[social media]], [[subjectivity]], [[tiredness]], [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[violence]].\n\n==Reception==\n''\"M\u00fcdigkeitsgesellschaft\"'' will soon be available in 11 languages.<ref>{{cite web|title=Translations|url=http://www.matthes-seitz-berlin.de/foreign-rights.html}}</ref> Several South Korean newspapers voted it to be the most important book in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=2012\ub144 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uc120\uc815 \uc62c\ud574\uc758 \ucc45|trans-title=2012 Media Picks for Book of the Year|url=http://www.aladin.co.kr/events/wevent_book.aspx?pn=2012_media|publisher=Aladin Books|access-date=30 May 2018}}</ref> [[The Guardian]] wrote a positive review of his 2017 book \"Psychopolitics: Neoliberalism and New Technologies of Power\",<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/30/psychopolitics-neolberalism-new-technologies-byung-chul-han-review|title=Psychopolitics: Neoliberalism and New Technologies of Power by Byung-Chul Han \u2013 review|last=Jeffries|first=Stuart|date=2017-12-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> while the Hong Kong Review of Books praised his writing as \"concise almost to the point of being aphoristic, Han's writing style manages to distil complex ideas into highly readable and persuasive prose\" while noting that \"on other occasions, Han veers uncomfortably close to billboard-sized statements ('Neoliberalism is the ''capitalism of'' ''Like'' '), which highlights the fine line between cleverness and self-indulgent sloganeering.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hkrbooks.com/2018/05/16/psychopolitics/|title=Psychopolitics|last=Hamilton|date=2018-05-16|website=HONG KONG REVIEW OF BOOKS  \u9999\u6e2f\u66f8\u8a55|language=en|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> The LA Book Review described him as \"as good a candidate as any for philosopher of the moment.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/media-and-transparency-an-introduction-to-byung-chul-han-in-english/|title=Media and Transparency: An Introduction to Byung-Chul Han in English|last=West|first=Adrian Nathan|website=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>\n\n== Works in English ==\n\n* ''The Burnout Society'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2015) {{ISBN|9780804795098}}.\n* ''The Transparency Society'' (Stanford: Stanford Briefs, 2015) {{ISBN|080479460X}}\n* ''Psychopolitics: Neoliberalism and New Technologies of Power'' (London & New York: Verso Books, 2017) {{ISBN|9781784785772}}\n* ''The Scent of Time: A Philosophical Essay on the Art of Lingering'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2017) {{ISBN|1509516050}}\n* ''The Agony of Eros'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2017) {{ISBN|0262533375}}\n* ''In the Swarm: Digital Prospects'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2017), {{ISBN|0262533367}}\n* ''Shanzhai: Deconstruction in Chinese'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2017) {{ISBN|0262534363}}\n* ''Saving Beauty'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2017) {{ISBN|9781509515103}}\n* ''The Expulsion of the Other: Society, Perception and Communication Today'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2018) {{ISBN|1509523065}}\n* ''Topology of Violence'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2018) {{ISBN|9780262534956}}\n* ''What Is Power?''
