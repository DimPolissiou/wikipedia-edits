It was introduced among the [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Native Brazilians]] by [[Jesuits]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] and also observed by all the Portuguese first settlers.\n\nDuring colonial times, there was no freedom of religion. All Portuguese settlers and Brazilians were compulsorily bound to the Catholic faith and were bound to pay tithes to the church. After the Brazilian independence, the first constitution introduced freedom of religion in 1824, but [[Catholicism]] was kept as the [[official religion]]. The Imperial Government paid a salary to Catholic priest and influenced the appointment of bishops. The political-administrative division of the municipalities accompanied the hierarchical division of the bishoprics in \"''freguesias''\" (parishes). There was also some hindrances to the construction of temples and cemeteries that belonged to the [[Catholic Church]]. The first Republican Constitution in 1891 separated religion from state and made all religions equal in the Codes of Law, but the Catholic Church remained very influential until the 1970s. For example, due to the strong opposition of the Catholic Church, divorce was not allowed in Brazil until 1977 even if a separated couple observed a different religion.\n\nThe Catholic faith practiced in Brazil is full of popular festivities rooted in centuries-old Portuguese traditions, but also heavily influenced by African and [[Native Brazilian]] usage. Popular traditions include pilgrimages to the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida|National Shrine]] of [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] (''Nossa Senhora Aparecida''), the [[patron saint]] of Brazil, and religious festivals like the \"''C\u00edrio de Nazar\u00e9''\" in [[Bel\u00e9m]] and the \"''Festa do Divino''\" in many cities of Central Brazil. Areas that received many European immigrants in the last century, specially Italian and German, have Catholic traditions closer to that practiced in Europe.\n\nThe largest proportion of Catholics is concentrated in the [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeast]] (79.9%) and [[Southeastern Brazil|South]] (77.4%) regions. The smallest proportion of Catholics is found in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West]] region (69.1%). The State of [[Piau\u00ed]] has the largest proportion of Catholics (87,93%) and the State of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] has the smallest one (45.19%). Among the state capitals, [[Teresina]] has the largest proportion of Catholics in the country (86.010%), followed by [[Aracaju]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba|Jo\u00e3o Pessoa]].<ref name=\"Folha\">[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u83030.shtml Folha Online - Mundo.

[[Evangelical]] [[Protestantism]] and [[Pentecostalism]] has grown very rapidly in Brazil since the late 20th century.<ref>Patr\u00edcia Birman, and M\u00e1rcia Pereira Leite. \"Whatever Happened to What Used to Be the Largest Catholic Country in the World?,\" ''Daedalus'' (2000) 129#2 pp. 271-290 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027637 in JSTOR]</ref> The 2010 Census reported that 22.2% of the Brazilian population is Protestant, about 44 million people.  Brazil has many versions of Protestantism. These include neo-[[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], old Pentecostals and Traditional Protestants (most of them [[Baptists]], [[Presbyterians]] and [[Methodists]]) predominantly from [[Minas Gerais]] to the South. The [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil]], part of the [[Anglican Communion]], has some 120,000 members. Centers of neo-Pentecostalism are [[Londrina]] in [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]] state, as well the cities of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (city)|S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Belo Horizonte]] (capital of Minas Gerais), especially the suburban and nearby areas of these cities. [[Lutherans]] are concentrated mostly in the states of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and in countryside regions of the states of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]].\n\nAs of the year 2000, the largest proportion of Protestants is found in [[Northern Brazil|North]] (19.8%), [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]] (18.9%) and [[Southeastern Brazil|Southeast]] (17.5%) regions. Among the state capitals, [[Rio de Janeiro]] has the largest proportion of non-Pentecostal Protestants in the country (10.07%), followed by [[Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil|Vit\u00f3ria]], [[Porto Velho]], [[Cuiab\u00e1]] and [[Manaus]].

They comprise 21st century [[Immigration|immigrants]] from [[East Asia]], the [[Middle East]], or of recent immigrant descent.\n\n=== African and indigenous religions ===\n[[File:Orixa Yemanja Orossi.JPG|thumb|right|People during a celebration of Orisha, in [[Candombl\u00e9]] of ''Ile Ase Ijino Ilu Orossi''.]]\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1518 Figure of a Devotee of Shango Holding an Oshe Shango.jpg|180px|thumbnail|Figure of a Devotee of Shango Holding an Oshe Shango, Brooklyn Museum]]\n[[Afro-Brazilian religions]] are syncretic religions, such as [[Candombl\u00e9]], that have many followers, mainly [[Afro-Brazilian]]s. They are concentrated mainly in large urban centers in the Northeast, such as [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], [[Recife]], or [[Rio de Janeiro]] in the Southeast. The cities of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Florian\u00f3polis]] have a great number of followers, but in the South of Brazil the most common African influenced Ritual is Almas e Angola, which is an [[Umbanda]] like ritual. Nowadays, there are over 70 \"terreiros\" (temples) in Florian\u00f3polis, which are the places where the rituals run. In addition to Candombl\u00e9 which is of the [[Yoruba religion]], there is also Umbanda which blends [[Spiritism]] by ways of the same [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] belief system. There is prejudice about \"African cults\" in Brazil's south, but there are Catholics, Protestants and other kinds of Christians who also believe in the [[Orisha]]s, and go both to churches and terreiros.\n\nCandombl\u00e9, Umbanda, Batuque, [[Shango|Xango]], and [[Tambor de Mina]], were originally brought by black [[slavery|slaves]] shipped from Africa to Brazil. These black slaves would summon their gods, called [[Orisha|Orixas]], Voduns or Inkices with chants and dances they had brought from Africa. These cults were persecuted throughout most of Brazilian history, largely because they were believed to be [[Paganism|pagan]] or even [[Satanism|satanic]]. However, the Brazilian [[republic]]an government legalized all of them on the grounds of the necessary separation between the State and the Church in 1889.\n\nIn current practice, Umbanda followers leave offerings of food, candles and flowers in public places for the spirits. Candombl\u00e9 terreiros are more hidden from general view, except in famous festivals such as Iyemanja Festival and the Waters of Oxala in the Northeast.\n\nFrom [[Bahia]] northwards there are different practices such as Catimbo, Jurema with heavy indigenous elements. All over the country, but mainly in the [[Amazon rainforest]], there are many Indians still practicing their original traditions. Many of their beliefs and use of naturally occurring plant derivatives are incorporated into African, Spiritualists and folk religion.\n\nThough these religions have experienced much greater freedom since the decline of the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], they have suffered increasing hostility from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, with attacks on temples and defacement of statues of the gods.<ref name=\"Mana2007\">[http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S0104-93132007000100003&script=sci_arttext Neo-Pentecostalism and Afro-Brazilian religions: explaining the attacks on symbols of the African religious heritage in contemporary Brazil].

Spiritism does follow Jesus's principal and his moral teachings. With almost 4 million adherents in 2010, is the second largest (???) Religion of Brazil. In mainly Minas Gerais and [[S\u00e3o Paulo State|S\u00e3o Paulo]], large sections of the middle class, about 1-2% of the total population, are [[Kardecist Spiritism|Kardecist]], sometimes pure, sometimes in [[syncretism]] with Roman Catholicism.\n\n=== Buddhism ===\n[[File:Tibetan Buddhist Temple RS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] temple in [[Tr\u00eas Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]].]]\n{{Main|Buddhism in Brazil}}\nBuddhism is probably the largest of all minority religions, with about 215,000 followers. This is mostly because of the large [[Japanese Brazilian]] community. About a fifth of the Japanese Brazilian community are followers of Buddhism. Japanese Buddhist sects like [[Jodo Shinshu]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]] (most notably the [[Soka Gakkai]]), and [[Zen]] are the most popular. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] ([[Vajrayana]]) is also present, since [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] founded the Khadro Ling center in [[Tr\u00eas Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (where he lived until his death in 2002), and many other institutions across the country. However, in recent years both Chinese Mahayana and South East Asian Theraveda sects are gaining popularity. Buddhism was introduced to Brazil in the early twentieth century, by Japanese immigrants, although now, 60% of Japanese Brazilians are now Christian due to missionary activities and intermarriage. Nevertheless, Japanese Brazilian culture has a substantial Buddhist influence.\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Sinagoga-kahal-zur-israel-recife.jpg|thumb|[[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], (founded 1636) in [[Recife]] was the first Jewish congregation in the Americas.]]\n[[File:Sinagoga Beth El, S\u00e3o Paulo 2.JPG|thumb|right|A synagogue in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].]]\n{{Main|History of the Jews in Brazil}}\nThe first Jews arrived in Brazil as ''crist\u00e3os-novos'' ([[New Christians]]) or [[conversos]], names applied to Jews or Muslims who converted to Catholicism, most of them forcibly. According to the [[Inquisition]] reports, many New Christians living in Brazil during colonial times were condemned for secretly observing [[Judaism|Jewish customs]].<ref name=jvt>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html Oreck, Alden.

Accessed 2008-06-09</ref>\n\nIn 1630, the Dutch conquered portions of northeast Brazil and permitted the open practice of any religion. Many Jews came from the Netherlands to live in Brazil in the area dominated by the Dutch. Most of them were descendants of the Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Portugal in 1497. In 1636, the [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], the first [[synagogue]] in the Americas was built in [[Recife]], the capital of [[Dutch Brazil]].<ref name=jvt/> The original building remains to this day,<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/922773.html  Synagogue in Brazilian town Recife considered oldest in the Americas].

They were mainly [[Moroccan Jews]], descendants of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497.\n\nThe first wave of [[Sephardic Jews]] was exceeded by the larger wave of immigration by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] that came at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, mainly from Russia, Poland, [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. A final significant group came, fleeing [[Nazism]] or the destruction that followed World War II.\n\nBrazil has the second-largest Jewish population in Latin America of 120,000 people, making up a total of 0.06% of Brazil's population.<ref name=\"Beit Hatfutsot\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/jewish-community-brazil/|title=The Jewish Community in Brazil|website=Beit Hatfutsot|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> As of 2017, Rio de Janeiro's Jewish population was 22,000, with 24 active synagogues.{{r|Beit Hatfutsot}}\n\n[[File:Mesquita do Br\u00e1s 1.JPG|thumb|right|Mosque in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].]]\n\n=== Islam ===\n{{Main|Islam in Brazil}}\n{{Further|Mal\u00ea Revolt}}\nAccording to the 2010 Census, there were 35,167 [[Islam in Brazil|Muslims]] in Brazil.<ref name=\"census2010a\">ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Censos/Censo_Demografico_2010/Caracteristicas_Gerais_Religiao_Deficiencia/tab1_4.pdf</ref>   The Federation of Muslim Associations of Brazil estimates there are about 1.5 million Muslims and others say about 400.000 to 500.000. There are over 150 mosques where Muslims perform their daily prayers.\n\n[[Islam in Brazil]] may be presumed to have first been practiced by African slaves brought from West Africa. Scholars note that Brazil received more enslaved Muslims than anywhere else in the Americas.<ref>Lovejoy, Paul E., ''Muslim Encounters With Slavery in Brazil'', Markus Wiener Pub., 2007. {{ISBN|1-55876-378-3}}.</ref> During [[Ramadan]], in January 1835, a small group of black slaves and freedmen from [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador da Bahia]], inspired by [[Muslim]] teachers, rose up against the government in the [[Mal\u00ea Revolt]], the largest [[slave rebellion]] in Brazil. (Muslims were called ''mal\u00ea'' in [[Bahia]] at this time, from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''imale'' that designated a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Muslim.)  Fearing the example might be followed, the Brazilian authorities began to watch the ''mal\u00eas'' very carefully and in subsequent years intensive efforts were made towards conversions to Catholic Christianity and erase the popular memory of and affection towards [[Islam]].<ref>Joao Jose Reis, ''Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia'', Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993</ref> However, the African Muslim community was not erased overnight, and as late as 1910 it is estimated there were still some 100,000 African Muslims living in Brazil.<ref>Steven Barboza, ''American Jihad'', 1993</ref>\n\nA recent trend has been the increase in [[Religious conversion#Islam|conversion]]s to Islam among non-Arab citizens.<ref name=religiousfreedom2006>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091130031802/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127381.htm \"Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor International Religious Freedom Report 2009\"] October 26, 2009, US Department of State report on Brazil</ref>\n\n=== Hinduism ===\n{{Main|Hinduism in Brazil}}\nMost of the Brazilian Hindus are ethnic East [[India]]ns. However, there are new converts due to the missionary effects of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]].\n\nThere are 1,500 PIOs ([[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|People of Indian origin]]) and about 400 NRIs ([[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Non-Resident Indian]]) in Brazil.\n\n;First wave of Immigration\nA small number of Sindhis had arrived here from Suriname and Central America in 1960 to set up shop as traders in the city of [[Manaus]].\n\n;Second wave of Immigration \nConsisted of university professors who arrived in the 190s and also in the 1970s.\n\nOther PIOs migrated to this country from various African countries, mainly from former Portuguese colonies (especially [[Mozambique]]), soon after their independence in the 1970s. The number of PIOs in Brazil has been augmented in recent years by the arrival of nuclear scientists and computer professionals.\n\nThere are as many as 1,500 PIOs among the Indian community in Brazil, and only 400 NRIs since foreign nationals can acquire local citizenship without any discrimination after 15 years of domicile in this country. Brazil has also no bar against dual citizenship. But in recent years, it has been granting immigration visas only in high technology fields. The only exceptions are the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] in Manaus (who have formed an Indian Association with about a hundred members) and the [[Goa]]ns in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBeside the PIOs, there are [[Hindu]] organizations such as [[ISKCON]], [[Brahma Kumari]]s are very active in Brasil. The number of adherents of these organizations is not officially recorded but is estimated to be a few thousand.\n\n===Positivist Church of Brazil===\n[[File:Pretos-velhos.JPG|thumbnail|Old Black Women and Men Spirits Images]]\nMany confuse Spiritism with Afro-Brazilian Religions like [[Umbanda]], [[Candombl\u00e9]] and others that have a following of almost 600,000 adherents. One of the most unusual features of the rich Brazilian spiritual landscape are the sects which use [[ayahuasca]] (an Amazonian [[entheogen]]ic tea), including [[Santo Daime]], [[Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal]], and Centro de Cultura C\u00f3smica. This syncretism, coupled with ideas prevalent during the military dicatorship, has resulted in a church for the secular, based on philosopher [[Auguste Comte]]'s principles of [[positivism]], based at the Positivist Church of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n=== Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith ===\n{{main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Brazil}}\nThe Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Brazil started in 1919 with [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] first visiting the country that year,<ref name=\"alamb\">{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 | location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url = http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}</ref> and the first Bah\u00e1'\u00ed [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assembly]] in Brazil was established in 1928.

During the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], which was held in Brazil, the international and local Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community were given the responsibility for organizing a series of different programs, and since then the involvements of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community in the country have continued to multiply.

It was introduced among the [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Native Brazilians]] by [[Jesuits]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] and also observed by all the Portuguese first settlers.\n\nDuring colonial times, there was no freedom of religion. All Portuguese settlers and Brazilians were compulsorily bound to the Catholic faith and were bound to pay tithes to the church. After the Brazilian independence, the first constitution introduced freedom of religion in 1824, but [[Catholicism]] was kept as the [[official religion]]. The Imperial Government paid a salary to Catholic priest and influenced the appointment of bishops. The political-administrative division of the municipalities accompanied the hierarchical division of the bishoprics in \"''freguesias''\" (parishes). There was also some hindrances to the construction of temples and cemeteries that belonged to the [[Catholic Church]]. The first Republican Constitution in 1891 separated religion from state and made all religions equal in the Codes of Law, but the Catholic Church remained very influential until the 1970s. For example, due to the strong opposition of the Catholic Church, divorce was not allowed in Brazil until 1977 even if a separated couple observed a different religion.\n\nThe Catholic faith practiced in Brazil is full of popular festivities rooted in centuries-old Portuguese traditions, but also heavily influenced by African and [[Native Brazilian]] usage. Popular traditions include pilgrimages to the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida|National Shrine]] of [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] (''Nossa Senhora Aparecida''), the [[patron saint]] of Brazil, and religious festivals like the \"''C\u00edrio de Nazar\u00e9''\" in [[Bel\u00e9m]] and the \"''Festa do Divino''\" in many cities of Central Brazil. Areas that received many European immigrants in the last century, specially Italian and German, have Catholic traditions closer to that practiced in Europe.\n\nThe largest proportion of Catholics is concentrated in the [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeast]] (79.9%) and [[Southeastern Brazil|South]] (77.4%) regions. The smallest proportion of Catholics is found in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West]] region (69.1%). The State of [[Piau\u00ed]] has the largest proportion of Catholics (87,93%) and the State of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] has the smallest one (45.19%).

The cities of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Florian\u00f3polis]] have a great number of followers, but in the South of Brazil the most common African influenced Ritual is Almas e Angola, which is an [[Umbanda]] like ritual. Nowadays, there are over 70 \"terreiros\" (temples) in Florian\u00f3polis, which are the places where the rituals run. In addition to Candombl\u00e9 which is of the [[Yoruba religion]], there is also Umbanda which blends [[Spiritism]] by ways of the same [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] belief system. There is prejudice about \"African cults\" in Brazil's south, but there are Catholics, Protestants and other kinds of Christians who also believe in the [[Orisha]]s, and go both to churches and terreiros.\n\nCandombl\u00e9, Umbanda, Batuque, [[Shango|Xango]], and [[Tambor de Mina]], were originally brought by black [[slavery|slaves]] shipped from Africa to Brazil. These black slaves would summon their gods, called [[Orisha|Orixas]], Voduns or Inkices with chants and dances they had brought from Africa. These cults were persecuted throughout most of Brazilian history, largely because they were believed to be [[Paganism|pagan]] or even [[Satanism|satanic]]. However, the Brazilian [[republic]]an government legalized all of them on the grounds of the necessary separation between the State and the Church in 1889.\n\nIn current practice, Umbanda followers leave offerings of food, candles and flowers in public places for the spirits. Candombl\u00e9 terreiros are more hidden from general view, except in famous festivals such as Iyemanja Festival and the Waters of Oxala in the Northeast.\n\nFrom [[Bahia]] northwards there are different practices such as Catimbo, Jurema with heavy indigenous elements. All over the country, but mainly in the [[Amazon rainforest]], there are many Indians still practicing their original traditions. Many of their beliefs and use of naturally occurring plant derivatives are incorporated into African, Spiritualists and folk religion.\n\nThough these religions have experienced much greater freedom since the decline of the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], they have suffered increasing hostility from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, with attacks on temples and defacement of statues of the gods.<ref name=\"Mana2007\">[http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S0104-93132007000100003&script=sci_arttext Neo-Pentecostalism and Afro-Brazilian religions: explaining the attacks on symbols of the African religious heritage in contemporary Brazil].

[http://www.academia.edu/1619158/Allan_Kardec_and_the_Development_of_a_Research_Program_in_Psychic_Experiences ''Allan Kardec and the development of a research program in psychic experiences'']</ref>.  Spiritism does follow Jesus's principal and his moral teachings. With almost 4 million adherents in 2010, is the second largest (???) Religion of Brazil. In mainly Minas Gerais and [[S\u00e3o Paulo State|S\u00e3o Paulo]], large sections of the middle class, about 1-2% of the total population, are [[Kardecist Spiritism|Kardecist]], sometimes pure, sometimes in [[syncretism]] with Roman Catholicism.\n\n=== Buddhism ===\n[[File:Tibetan Buddhist Temple RS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] temple in [[Tr\u00eas Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]].]]\n{{Main|Buddhism in Brazil}}\nBuddhism is probably the largest of all minority religions, with about 215,000 followers. This is mostly because of the large [[Japanese Brazilian]] community. About a fifth of the Japanese Brazilian community are followers of Buddhism. Japanese Buddhist sects like [[Jodo Shinshu]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]] (most notably the [[Soka Gakkai]]), and [[Zen]] are the most popular. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] ([[Vajrayana]]) is also present, since [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] founded the Khadro Ling center in [[Tr\u00eas Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (where he lived until his death in 2002), and many other institutions across the country. However, in recent years both Chinese Mahayana and South East Asian Theraveda sects are gaining popularity. Buddhism was introduced to Brazil in the early twentieth century, by Japanese immigrants, although now, 60% of Japanese Brazilians are now Christian due to missionary activities and intermarriage. Nevertheless, Japanese Brazilian culture has a substantial Buddhist influence.\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Sinagoga-kahal-zur-israel-recife.jpg|thumb|[[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], (founded 1636) in [[Recife]] was the first Jewish congregation in the Americas.]]\n[[File:Sinagoga Beth El, S\u00e3o Paulo 2.JPG|thumb|right|A synagogue in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].]]\n{{Main|History of the Jews in Brazil}}\nThe first Jews arrived in Brazil as ''crist\u00e3os-novos'' ([[New Christians]]) or [[conversos]], names applied to Jews or Muslims who converted to Catholicism, most of them forcibly. According to the [[Inquisition]] reports, many New Christians living in Brazil during colonial times were condemned for secretly observing [[Judaism|Jewish customs]].<ref name=jvt>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html Oreck, Alden. The Virtual Jewish History Tour: Brazil]. [[Jewish Virtual Library]]. Accessed 2008-06-09</ref>\n\nIn 1630, the Dutch conquered portions of northeast Brazil and permitted the open practice of any religion. Many Jews came from the Netherlands to live in Brazil in the area dominated by the Dutch. Most of them were descendants of the Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Portugal in 1497. In 1636, the [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], the first [[synagogue]] in the Americas was built in [[Recife]], the capital of [[Dutch Brazil]].<ref name=jvt/> The original building remains to this day,<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/922773.html  Synagogue in Brazilian town Recife considered oldest in the Americas].

Transaction Publishers, 1997. {{ISBN|0-7658-0660-6}}</ref>\n\nThe first Jews that stayed in Brazil and openly practiced their religion came when the first Brazilian constitution granted freedom of religion in 1824, just after the independence. They were mainly [[Moroccan Jews]], descendants of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497.\n\nThe first wave of [[Sephardic Jews]] was exceeded by the larger wave of immigration by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] that came at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, mainly from Russia, Poland, [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. A final significant group came, fleeing [[Nazism]] or the destruction that followed World War II.\n\nBrazil has the second-largest Jewish population in Latin America of 120,000 people, making up a total of 0.06% of Brazil's population.<ref name=\"Beit Hatfutsot\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/jewish-community-brazil/|title=The Jewish Community in Brazil|website=Beit Hatfutsot|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> As of 2017, Rio de Janeiro's Jewish population was 22,000, with 24 active synagogues.{{r|Beit Hatfutsot}}\n\n[[File:Mesquita do Br\u00e1s 1.JPG|thumb|right|Mosque in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].]]\n\n=== Islam ===\n{{Main|Islam in Brazil}}\n{{Further|Mal\u00ea Revolt}}\nAccording to the 2010 Census, there were 35,167 [[Islam in Brazil|Muslims]] in Brazil.<ref name=\"census2010a\">ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Censos/Censo_Demografico_2010/Caracteristicas_Gerais_Religiao_Deficiencia/tab1_4.pdf</ref>   The Federation of Muslim Associations of Brazil estimates there are about 1.5 million Muslims and others say about 400.000 to 500.000. There are over 150 mosques where Muslims perform their daily prayers.\n\n[[Islam in Brazil]] may be presumed to have first been practiced by African slaves brought from West Africa. Scholars note that Brazil received more enslaved Muslims than anywhere else in the Americas.<ref>Lovejoy, Paul E., ''Muslim Encounters With Slavery in Brazil'', Markus Wiener Pub., 2007. {{ISBN|1-55876-378-3}}.</ref> During [[Ramadan]], in January 1835, a small group of black slaves and freedmen from [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador da Bahia]], inspired by [[Muslim]] teachers, rose up against the government in the [[Mal\u00ea Revolt]], the largest [[slave rebellion]] in Brazil. (Muslims were called ''mal\u00ea'' in [[Bahia]] at this time, from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''imale'' that designated a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Muslim.)  Fearing the example might be followed, the Brazilian authorities began to watch the ''mal\u00eas'' very carefully and in subsequent years intensive efforts were made towards conversions to Catholic Christianity and erase the popular memory of and affection towards [[Islam]].<ref>Joao Jose Reis, ''Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia'', Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993</ref> However, the African Muslim community was not erased overnight, and as late as 1910 it is estimated there were still some 100,000 African Muslims living in Brazil.<ref>Steven Barboza, ''American Jihad'', 1993</ref>\n\nA recent trend has been the increase in [[Religious conversion#Islam|conversion]]s to Islam among non-Arab citizens.<ref name=religiousfreedom2006>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091130031802/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127381.htm \"Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor International Religious Freedom Report 2009\"] October 26, 2009, US Department of State report on Brazil</ref>\n\n=== Hinduism ===\n{{Main|Hinduism in Brazil}}\nMost of the Brazilian Hindus are ethnic East [[India]]ns. However, there are new converts due to the missionary effects of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]].\n\nThere are 1,500 PIOs ([[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|People of Indian origin]]) and about 400 NRIs ([[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Non-Resident Indian]]) in Brazil.\n\n;First wave of Immigration\nA small number of Sindhis had arrived here from Suriname and Central America in 1960 to set up shop as traders in the city of [[Manaus]].\n\n;Second wave of Immigration \nConsisted of university professors who arrived in the 190s and also in the 1970s.\n\nOther PIOs migrated to this country from various African countries, mainly from former Portuguese colonies (especially [[Mozambique]]), soon after their independence in the 1970s. The number of PIOs in Brazil has been augmented in recent years by the arrival of nuclear scientists and computer professionals.\n\nThere are as many as 1,500 PIOs among the Indian community in Brazil, and only 400 NRIs since foreign nationals can acquire local citizenship without any discrimination after 15 years of domicile in this country. Brazil has also no bar against dual citizenship. But in recent years, it has been granting immigration visas only in high technology fields. The only exceptions are the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] in Manaus (who have formed an Indian Association with about a hundred members) and the [[Goa]]ns in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBeside the PIOs, there are [[Hindu]] organizations such as [[ISKCON]], [[Brahma Kumari]]s are very active in Brasil. The number of adherents of these organizations is not officially recorded but is estimated to be a few thousand.\n\n===Positivist Church of Brazil===\n[[File:Pretos-velhos.JPG|thumbnail|Old Black Women and Men Spirits Images]]\nMany confuse Spiritism with Afro-Brazilian Religions like [[Umbanda]], [[Candombl\u00e9]] and others that have a following of almost 600,000 adherents. One of the most unusual features of the rich Brazilian spiritual landscape are the sects which use [[ayahuasca]] (an Amazonian [[entheogen]]ic tea), including [[Santo Daime]], [[Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal]], and Centro de Cultura C\u00f3smica. This syncretism, coupled with ideas prevalent during the military dicatorship, has resulted in a church for the secular, based on philosopher [[Auguste Comte]]'s principles of [[positivism]], based at the Positivist Church of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n=== Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith ===\n{{main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Brazil}}\nThe Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Brazil started in 1919 with [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] first visiting the country that year,<ref name=\"alamb\">{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 | location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url = http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}</ref> and the first Bah\u00e1'\u00ed [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assembly]] in Brazil was established in 1928. There followed a period of growth with the arrival of coordinated [[Pioneering (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed)|pioneers]] from the United States finding national Brazilian converts and in 1961 an independent national Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community was formed. During the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], which was held in Brazil, the international and local Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community were given the responsibility for organizing a series of different programs, and since then the involvements of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community in the country have continued to multiply.

UK reformed with John Wetton, Eddie Jobson and Terry Bozzio for a world tour in 2012.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and first album===\nSinger/bassist [[John Wetton]] and drummer [[Bill Bruford]] had worked together in [[King Crimson]] from 1972 until 1974, when guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] disbanded the group.<ref>[http://www.dgmlive.com/kc/index.htm?group=wetton&bio=true King Crimson<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222402/http://www.dgmlive.com/kc/index.htm?group=wetton&bio=true |date=27 September 2007}}</ref> In July 1976, Bruford assisted Wetton on demos for a proposed solo album by the latter (a couple of these demos were later released on ''Monkey Business''). In September 1976, they worked on forming a band with keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]], who had previously worked with Bruford in [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. The project was stopped by Wakeman's label. According to Bruford, \"[[A&M Records]] were unwilling to let their 'star', Wakeman, walk off with a used, slightly soiled King Crimson rhythm section, and the idea failed.\"<ref name=\"DPRP : Counting Out Time : UK - UK\">[http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1978_03 DPRP : Counting Out Time : UK - UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nBruford and Wetton next asked guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] to reform King Crimson.<ref>[http://www.dgmlive.com/archive.htm?artist=25&show=1172 Robert Fripp on 18 June 1979 in Chicago<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> When Fripp eventually declined, Bruford and Wetton decided that each would bring in a musician of his choice to form a new band.

Wetton, following the recording of his solo album ''[[Caught in the Crossfire (album)|Caught in the Crossfire]]'' (summer 1980) and a brief stint with [[Wishbone Ash]] (October\u2013December 1980), eventually left E.G. Records to sign with [[Geffen Records]] and ex-Yes manager Brian Lane and started [[Asia (band)|Asia]] with [[Steve Howe (guitarist)|Steve Howe]], [[Carl Palmer]] and [[Geoffrey Downes]].

Holdsworth and Bozzio played together in [[HoBoLeMa]] almost three decades later.\n\n===Legacy project===\nFrom 1995 to 1998, Jobson and Wetton worked together on a proposed U.K. reunion album, also recording contributions by Bruford, [[Tony Levin]], [[Steve Hackett]] and [[Francis Dunnery]]. When Wetton departed, \"Legacy\" became an Eddie Jobson solo project, with Wetton replaced on lead vocals by [[Aaron Lippert]]. However, Jobson eventually abandoned the project. Three tracks intended for it found their way onto ''Voices of Life'', a compilation by Bulgarian Women's Choir organised by Jobson.<ref>[http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_edge_eddie_jobson/ On The Edge With Eddie Jobson<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112003703/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_edge_eddie_jobson/ |date=12 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===UKZ and reunion===\nIn October 2007, Jobson announced a new band, [[UKZ]], with Lippert and former King Crimson bassist/guitarist [[Trey Gunn]] among others, which released an EP called \"Radiation\" in March 2009. In late 2009, Jobson and Wetton both talked about a possible reunion of U.K. A U.K. reunion tour in February/March 2010 with Jobson, Wetton, [[Marco Minnemann]] on drums (from UKZ) and [[Greg Howe]] (Victor Wooten, Vitalij Kuprij, Michael Jackson) on guitar was described to promoters, but not confirmed by Wetton.\n\nWetton and Jobson performed three concerts in Poland in November 2009 as part of Jobson's Ultimate Zero (U-Z) project. The line-up also featured Minnemann, Howe, and [[Tony Levin]] (stick). They performed music from UK and [[King Crimson]]. A CD compiled from various U-Z performances from 2009, entitled ''[[Ultimate Zero Tour - Live]]'', including multiple tracks from the Polish shows, was then released.<ref>[http://www.ukzband.com UKZ]</ref>\n\nIt was announced on 11 February 2011, and later confirmed by John Wetton on his website, that U.K. had reformed to play two shows in Japan on 15 and 16 April  2011. The line-up was Jobson and Wetton, with Minnemann and [[Alex Machacek]] performing drums and guitar respectively. US dates, including a show in San Francisco, were also announced and performed in April 2011. A DVD called \"[[Reunion: Live in Tokyo]]\" was culled from these shows and officially released in 2013.\n\nFormer drummer Bozzio then rejoined for an American tour in 2012. The line-up for the subsequent European tour included additional musicians [[Gary Husband]] (drums) and a returning Alex Machacek on guitar.\n\nIn 2013, U.K. did an \"Azure Seas\" tour with Machacek once again taking on guitar duties, and an East Coast tour with [[Virgil Donati]] performing drumming duties in place of Bozzio, who had once again departed the band. On 8 November of the same year, the band did also a special concert performance of their two studio albums in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], in Japan. The drummer for that special concert was Marco Minnemann.\n\nU.K. appeared in the 2014 edition of ''Cruise to the Edge'' progressive rock festival. The line-up once again included both Machacek and Donati. In 2015 the band announced their final world tour, with the band being joined by Donati and Machacek. Donati was then replaced by [[Dream Theater]] drummer [[Mike Mangini]] for the final dates in the USA and Japan.\n\n==Musical style==\nThroughout their brief existence, U.K.'s music was characterised by skilled musicianship, jazzy harmonies, close harmony vocals, mixed meters, electric violin solos, and unusually varied [[synthesizer|synthesiser]] ([[Yamaha CS-80]])<ref name=\"DPRP : Counting Out Time : UK - UK\"/> sonorities.

UK reformed with John Wetton, Eddie Jobson and Terry Bozzio for a world tour in 2012.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and first album===\nSinger/bassist [[John Wetton]] and drummer [[Bill Bruford]] had worked together in [[King Crimson]] from 1972 until 1974, when guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] disbanded the group.<ref>[http://www.dgmlive.com/kc/index.htm?group=wetton&bio=true King Crimson<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222402/http://www.dgmlive.com/kc/index.htm?group=wetton&bio=true |date=27 September 2007}}</ref> In July 1976, Bruford assisted Wetton on demos for a proposed solo album by the latter (a couple of these demos were later released on ''Monkey Business''). In September 1976, they worked on forming a band with keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]], who had previously worked with Bruford in [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. The project was stopped by Wakeman's label. According to Bruford, \"[[A&M Records]] were unwilling to let their 'star', Wakeman, walk off with a used, slightly soiled King Crimson rhythm section, and the idea failed.\"<ref name=\"DPRP : Counting Out Time : UK - UK\">[http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1978_03 DPRP : Counting Out Time : UK - UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nBruford and Wetton next asked guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] to reform King Crimson.<ref>[http://www.dgmlive.com/archive.htm?artist=25&show=1172 Robert Fripp on 18 June 1979 in Chicago<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> When Fripp eventually declined, Bruford and Wetton decided that each would bring in a musician of his choice to form a new band.

Following two lengthy American tours (June\u2013October 1978), Wetton and Jobson decided to fire Holdsworth over musical differences, and since Bruford had indicated to Wetton that he would favor Holdsworth in the event of a split in the band, they lined up [[Terry Bozzio]] (another one-time [[Frank Zappa]] band member) to replace Bruford as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Curtiss |first1=Ron |last2=Weiner |first2=Aaron |title=John Wetton (King Crimson, U.K., Asia): The Complete Boffomundo Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hcovFGVW44 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=3 March 2019 |date=3 June 2016}} Event occurs at 20:50-24:27.</ref> Bruford took several instrumentals developed by him for the live U.K. repertoire (\"Forever Until Sunday\", \"Sahara of Snow Part I\", \"Sahara of Snow Part II\", which originally were slated for the second U.K. album), to be used instead on ''[[One of a Kind (Bruford album)|One of a Kind]]'' (1979), the second album of his quartet [[Bruford (band)|Bruford]].<ref name=\"DPRP : Counting Out Time : UK - UK\"/>\n\n===Trio line-up===\nU.K. attempted unsuccessfully to find another guitarist before resolving to continue as a trio.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Curtiss |first1=Ron |last2=Weiner |first2=Aaron |title=John Wetton (King Crimson, U.K., Asia): The Complete Boffomundo Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hcovFGVW44 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=3 March 2019 |date=3 June 2016}} Event occurs at 19:58-20:16.</ref> They recorded the studio album ''[[Danger Money]]'', released in March 1979, and spent much of that year touring North America as opening act for [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].

Wetton, following the recording of his solo album ''[[Caught in the Crossfire (album)|Caught in the Crossfire]]'' (summer 1980) and a brief stint with [[Wishbone Ash]] (October\u2013December 1980), eventually left E.G. Records to sign with [[Geffen Records]] and ex-Yes manager Brian Lane and started [[Asia (band)|Asia]] with [[Steve Howe (guitarist)|Steve Howe]], [[Carl Palmer]] and [[Geoffrey Downes]]. Bozzio formed [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]] with his then-wife [[Dale Bozzio]], guitarist [[Warren Cuccurullo]], bassist [[Patrick O'Hearn]] and [[Chuck Wild]] on keyboards\u2013 the first four also from line-ups with Zappa. Holdsworth and Bozzio played together in [[HoBoLeMa]] almost three decades later.\n\n===Legacy project===\nFrom 1995 to 1998, Jobson and Wetton worked together on a proposed U.K. reunion album, also recording contributions by Bruford, [[Tony Levin]], [[Steve Hackett]] and [[Francis Dunnery]]. When Wetton departed, \"Legacy\" became an Eddie Jobson solo project, with Wetton replaced on lead vocals by [[Aaron Lippert]]. However, Jobson eventually abandoned the project. Three tracks intended for it found their way onto ''Voices of Life'', a compilation by Bulgarian Women's Choir organised by Jobson.<ref>[http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_edge_eddie_jobson/ On The Edge With Eddie Jobson<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112003703/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_edge_eddie_jobson/ |date=12 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===UKZ and reunion===\nIn October 2007, Jobson announced a new band, [[UKZ]], with Lippert and former King Crimson bassist/guitarist [[Trey Gunn]] among others, which released an EP called \"Radiation\" in March 2009. In late 2009, Jobson and Wetton both talked about a possible reunion of U.K. A U.K. reunion tour in February/March 2010 with Jobson, Wetton, [[Marco Minnemann]] on drums (from UKZ) and [[Greg Howe]] (Victor Wooten, Vitalij Kuprij, Michael Jackson) on guitar was described to promoters, but not confirmed by Wetton.\n\nWetton and Jobson performed three concerts in Poland in November 2009 as part of Jobson's Ultimate Zero (U-Z) project. The line-up also featured Minnemann, Howe, and [[Tony Levin]] (stick). They performed music from UK and [[King Crimson]]. A CD compiled from various U-Z performances from 2009, entitled ''[[Ultimate Zero Tour - Live]]'', including multiple tracks from the Polish shows, was then released.<ref>[http://www.ukzband.com UKZ]</ref>\n\nIt was announced on 11 February 2011, and later confirmed by John Wetton on his website, that U.K. had reformed to play two shows in Japan on 15 and 16 April  2011. The line-up was Jobson and Wetton, with Minnemann and [[Alex Machacek]] performing drums and guitar respectively. US dates, including a show in San Francisco, were also announced and performed in April 2011. A DVD called \"[[Reunion: Live in Tokyo]]\" was culled from these shows and officially released in 2013.\n\nFormer drummer Bozzio then rejoined for an American tour in 2012. The line-up for the subsequent European tour included additional musicians [[Gary Husband]] (drums) and a returning Alex Machacek on guitar.\n\nIn 2013, U.K. did an \"Azure Seas\" tour with Machacek once again taking on guitar duties, and an East Coast tour with [[Virgil Donati]] performing drumming duties in place of Bozzio, who had once again departed the band. On 8 November of the same year, the band did also a special concert performance of their two studio albums in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], in Japan. The drummer for that special concert was Marco Minnemann.\n\nU.K. appeared in the 2014 edition of ''Cruise to the Edge'' progressive rock festival. The line-up once again included both Machacek and Donati. In 2015 the band announced their final world tour, with the band being joined by Donati and Machacek. Donati was then replaced by [[Dream Theater]] drummer [[Mike Mangini]] for the final dates in the USA and Japan.\n\n==Musical style==\nThroughout their brief existence, U.K.'s music was characterised by skilled musicianship, jazzy harmonies, close harmony vocals, mixed meters, electric violin solos, and unusually varied [[synthesizer|synthesiser]] ([[Yamaha CS-80]])<ref name=\"DPRP : Counting Out Time : UK - UK\"/> sonorities.

At the meeting when the time for enrollment came it was described that \"they rose in a body and fairly rushed the table, which was in danger of being overturned in the excitement of the moment\" Ivan Culpan, secretary of the league told the girls that the league would train them every evening in the lead up to the match.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Girl Footballers/League Club Formed/First Match on Saturday/Much Enthusiasm Shown\n| page =9\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17832\n| date = 1921-07-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210713.2.104\n| accessdate = 2020-02-29}}</ref> Over the next week the number of girls enrolled increased to 65. It later transpired that the members of the Auckland Rugby League who had attended had done so by invitation and were not necessarily acting on behalf of the league with the comments they had made. At the Auckland Rugby league Management meeting the following night the decision on whether to support the girls playing and affiliate the club with the league was deferred. Both G.

While on the same day the Fire Brigade players were called to a warehouse fire in the city at mid-day and were tired and late arriving to the ground so the match was abandoned.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =First Game on Carlaw Park/City Defeats Maritime/An Exciting Contest\n| page =9\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17818\n| date = 1921-06-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210627.2.128.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 25 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 10\u20138\n| report = <ref name=\"autoRefB\">{{cite news\n| title =First Game on Carlaw Park/City Defeats Maritime/An Exciting Contest\n| page =9\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17818\n| date = 1921-06-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210627.2.128.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-25}}</ref>| away = Maritime\n| try1 = H Hawkes, Harry Francis\n| con1 = W Minogue\n| pen1 = W Minogue (1 mark)\n| try2 = Lunn, [[Ivan Littlewood]]\n| con2 = [[Eric Grey]]\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = A Ferguson\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 25 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Devonport\n| score = PPD\n| report = <ref name=\"autoRefB\" />\n| away = Newton\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Devonport Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 25 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Marist\n| score = PPD\n| report = <ref name=\"autoRefB\" />\n| away = Fire Brigade\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 2\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n===Round 10===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 2 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Marist\n| score = 34\u20133\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Good Play On Carlaw Park/Marist Overwhelms Newton\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LII| issue=157\n| date = 1921-07-04\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19210704.2.93\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Newton\n| try1 = [[Ernie Herring]] 2, [[John Lang (New Zealand rugby league)|John Lang]], [[Arthur Singe]], Puha, A Eustace, P Gallagher\n| con1 = [[Ernie Herring]], [[Bill Stormont]], [[John Lang (New Zealand rugby league)|John Lang]], Carroll 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 3700\n| referee = T Hill\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 2 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 18\u201311\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Good Play On Carlaw Park/Ponsonby 18, Shore 11\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LII| issue=157\n| date = 1921-07-04\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19210704.2.93\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Devonport\n| try1 = [[Dougie McGregor]], Ben McGregor, [[Sam Lowrie]], W McNeil\n| con1 = [[Dougie McGregor]] 2\n| pen1 = [[Dougie McGregor]]\n| try2 = J Price, Cargill, [[Alf Townsend]]\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| drop2 = McAneny\n| stadium = Victoria Park 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = L Hemming\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 2 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Maritime\n| score = 24\u20136\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Maritime Beats Fire Brigade\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LII| issue=157\n| date = 1921-07-04\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19210704.2.93\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>| away = Fire Brigade\n| try1 = O\u2019Donnell, [[Ivan Littlewood]] 3, Ballyntyne, McGregor\n| con1 = O\u2019Donnell, [[Ivan Littlewood]], G Yardley\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = J Williams, Phil Castles\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = Mincham\n}}\n\n===Round 11===\nThe City v Newton game was discontinued at halftime due to the score line.

The New Zealand council decided that the rules should be amended to allow North Island teams to hold it but the donor, Dr. H. T.J. Thacker and the Canterbury Rugby League would not agree to them. As such the shield was returned to the donor. Mr. C Weaver donated a trophy to take its place and this became known as the Challenge Shield and it was this that Ponsonby went on to defend twice. They first hosted [[Petone Panthers|Petone]] from [[Wellington]] who they beat 18\u201313. In the curtain-raiser [[Petone Panthers|Petone juniors]] were defeated by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] by 14 points to 8.

[[City Rovers]] comfortably won the senior championship for the 4th time with a 8 win, 1 draw, 0 loss record ahead of Maritime who were unable to repeat their title win from the previous season. [[City Rovers|City]] had previously won the title in 1910, 1911, and 1916. This was to be the first of 3 consecutive titles for them.

At the meeting Grafton was granted permission to change its name to \u201cFire Brigade Club\u201d. [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] notified the league that the Devonport Borough Council had allocated the [[Devonport Domain]] for its use. During the season the club was named \u2018North Shore\u2019 and \u2018Devonport\u2019 interchangeably by both ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' and the ''[[Auckland Star]]''. In 1920 the club had seen a merger between [[North Shore Albions]] and the Sunnyside club and agreed on the name [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] but it appears that the stronger club\u2019s name was still more favoured by those reporting on the games, and it was eventually the name adopted by the club.

They were to play a game on Carlaw Park on the following Saturday afternoon. They were all aged between 16 and 20 years of age. The chairman of the Parnell club, Mr. A. R. Turner explained \"that it wished to develop the girls as well as the men, and to this end the club was being formed at the suggestion of the girls\". A trophy \"similar to the Monteith Shield\" had been donated, and \"members of the Auckland League Management Committee had donated a football, and were providing assistance in supplying jerseys. At the meeting when the time for enrollment came it was described that \"they rose in a body and fairly rushed the table, which was in danger of being overturned in the excitement of the moment\" Ivan Culpan, secretary of the league told the girls that the league would train them every evening in the lead up to the match.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Girl Footballers/League Club Formed/First Match on Saturday/Much Enthusiasm Shown\n| page =9\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17832\n| date = 1921-07-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210713.2.104\n| accessdate = 2020-02-29}}</ref> Over the next week the number of girls enrolled increased to 65.

The New Zealand council decided that the rules should be amended to allow North Island teams to hold it but the donor, Dr. H. T.J. Thacker and the Canterbury Rugby League would not agree to them. As such the shield was returned to the donor. Mr. C Weaver donated a trophy to take its place and this became known as the Challenge Shield and it was this that Ponsonby went on to defend twice. They first hosted [[Petone Panthers|Petone]] from [[Wellington]] who they beat 18-13. In the curtain-raiser [[Petone Panthers|Petone juniors]] were defeated by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] by 14 points to 8. In the evening the Petone players were entertained at the Druids\u2019 Hall by the [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] club and [[Auckland Rugby League|Auckland League]].
