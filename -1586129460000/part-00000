Cem passes mostly through limestone terrain where many [[karst]]ic formations are observed. The terrain through which it flows in its {{convert|58.8|km}} course, is at an elevation of more than 1,200 m and can reach as low as 50 m. Throughout its declining elevation, it passes through narrow valleys and steep canyons, where waterfalls are formed before it reaches the Zeta plain.\n\nThe first cultural indicators of human settlement in the Cem river basin are from the late Copper Age and early Bronze Age (3500-2300 BC). In following millennia, Illyrian tribes, the Roman empire, Slavic principalities, the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire controlled the area. Today, the river is divided by Albania and Montenegro.\n\nCem is one of the last free-flowing rivers in Europe. The river's basin is a source of very high biodiversity for the two countries. In the recent decades, it is threatened by industrialization, the installation of small hydropower stations and the effects of climate change.\n\n== Name ==\n[[Ptolemy]] is the first to mention Cem as ''Kinna'' in ancient Greek and later in [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] a location named ''Cinna'' in Latin is connected to the river. These two forms are considered to be written forms of a local, Illyrian name ''Cinua''.<ref name=\"3a\">{{cite book |last1=Mayer |first1=Anton |title=Die Sprache der alten Illyrier |date=1957 |publisher=In Kommission bei R.

In Montenegrin and also Bosniak and Serbian, ''Cijevna'' is derived from Serbo-Croatian ''cijev'' (pipe), but other toponyms preserve the older name like ''\u0106emovsko polje'' (field of Cem).\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gebirgsfahrten_15.JPG|thumb|Cem in Kelmend region]]\n\nCem originates in [[Kelmend (municipality)|Kelmend]], [[Mal\u00ebsi e Madhe]], Albania and flows through the region of [[Mal\u00ebsia]]. The river has two tributaries: Cem of [[Vuk\u00ebl]] (''Cemi i Vuklit'') and Cem of [[Selc\u00eb]] (''Cemi i Selc\u00ebs''), which join at the confluence of [[Tamar\u00eb]].<ref name=\"1a\">{{cite web |last1=Marojevi\u0107 Gali\u0107 |first1=Jelena |title=Plani i veprimit t\u00eb p\u00ebrbashk\u00ebt p\u00ebr mbrojtjen ekologjike t\u00eb lumit Cem dhe zhvillimi i qendruesh\u00ebm mjedisor n\u00eb zon\u00ebn nd\u00ebrkufitare [Mapping of common action plan for trans-border protection of Cem] |url=http://www.cemiriver.drupal.bildhosting.com/sites/cemiriver.me/files/field/publikacije/1.scientific_journal_albanian.pdf |website=GreenHome |publisher=Albania-Montenegro CrossBorder Cooperation Programme |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref> Cem of Vuk\u00ebl - the more important of the two in terms of water volume - rises at 900 m and flows for 17.9&nbsp;km. It passes through a narrow canyon, a terrain which widens only near [[Kozhnja]], where deposition has formed a small limestone valley. A creek called Cem of [[Nik\u00e7]] (''Cem i Nik\u00e7it'') also contributes to its flow volume except for the summer period when it runs dry.<ref name=\"1f\"/>\n\nCem of Selc\u00eb rises at 1,250 m on Mt. Bordolec near [[L\u00ebpush\u00eb]] and flows for 22.5&nbsp;km mostly through narrow limestone terrain until the valley of Tamar\u00eb.<ref name=\"1a\"/> In its course it passes through [[Gropat e Selc\u00ebs]] [[karstic cave]]s, the canyon of Gerrlla, 900 m long and 25 m deep, and the 30-meter high waterfall of Sllapi before Dobrinj\u00eb.\n\nAfter confluence, Cem flows generally southwest for {{convert|26.5|km}} and crosses into Montenegro, near Grabom.<ref name=\"1a\"/> A border crossing is also located after this village. Then the river flows through the villages of [[Tuzi|Tuzi municipality]] for {{convert|32.3|km}} before flowing into the [[Mora\u010da]] just south of [[Podgorica]] near Mitrovi\u0107i and [[Mojanovi\u0107i]].<ref name=\"1a\"/> The river and its terrain in Montenegro are divided into two parts. It firstly forms a steep canyon and then slowly crosses into the [[Zeta plain]], part of it called ''\u0106emovsko polje'' after the river. In the field, [[\u0160piro Mugo\u0161a Airport]] stands between Cem and [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]] and further west the [[Podgorica Airport]] is found. In this part, land occupation becomes more urbanized and industrialized.\n\nThe Cem canyon (''Kanjon Cijevne''/''Kanioni i Cemit'') is 12&nbsp;km long and has a depth of 903 m.<ref name=\"1g\"/> It is the natural habitat of many animal, insect and plant species. The canyon starts at the Albania-Montenegro border and forms a distinct geomorphological formation that crosses into \u0106emovsko polje roughly before [[Dinosha]] near Gurrec.\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Dinaric Alps subdivisions-fr.svg|thumb|Geomorphology of the Dinaric Alps. Cem is found in the Prokletije/Albanian Alps subdivision in B31]]\n\nThe geomorphological features of the Cem basin have their origin in the tectonic activity of the [[Alpine orogeny]], which formed the [[Dinaric Alps]] and its southern range, the [[Prokletije]] in the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic era up until today.<ref name=\"2c\"/> Specifically, the Cem basin is in the [[High Karst Unit]]. In this sub-unit, tectonic activity creates a vertical uplifting of landmasses and carbonate rocks are a large part of the landscape, which is defined by fluvial processes like the deposion of carbonate sediments by the river's streamflow. As the Prokletije have had glacial features, thus a high accumulutaion of water, the end of the Ice Age saw a general increase of Cem's discharge, which in turn enhanced fluvial processes in the basin.\n\nHeavy concentration of limestone has enabled the formation of [[Uvala (landform)|uvalas]], caves and other karst formations.<ref name=\"2c\"/> As water is retained in limestone, [[denudation]] of geological formations decreases.<ref name=\"1g\">{{cite journal |last1=Djurovi\u0107 |first1=Predrag |last2=Petrovi\u0107 |first2=Aleksandar |title=Large Canyons in Dinaric and Prokletije Mountains Region of Montenegro |journal=Geographica Pannonica |date=2007 |volume=11 |doi=10.5937/GeoPan0711014D |url=http://www.dgt.uns.ac.rs/pannonica/papers/volume11_03.pdf |accessdate=22 January 2020 |ref=1g}}</ref> The result of these interconnected processes is that Cem flows mostly through elevated, vertical and steep terrain that forms canyons, but crosses into small valleys where noncarbonate rocks have allowed horizontal erosion to take place like in the valley of Tamara. Then, the river exits high elevation areas and flows towards the Mora\u010da as the relief flattens and a [[polje]] is formed by karst processes.\n\n== Drainage Basin == \nThe drainage basin of Cem encompasses {{convert|368|km2|}} and is part of the Adriatic river basin along with other rivers that empty into [[Lake Skadar]], a total area of {{convert|6,560|km2|}}. 238&nbsp;km\u00b2 of the basin are in Albania, where the river and its tributaries originate, and 130&nbsp;km\u00b2 in Montenegro.<ref name=\"1a\" /> In the north, it borders the basin of Vermosh river and in the east that of L\u00ebpush\u00eb river. In the south, Cem's basin ends near [[Bog\u00eb, Albania|Bog\u00eb]].\n\nThe river's elevation ranges from above 1,250 m to no more than 50 m. Its elevation drop forms waterfalls of more than a 50-meter height in Montenegro. Annual precipitation is about 2,500&nbsp;mm - November being the highest point (361&nbsp;mm) and July the lowest (69.9&nbsp;mm). Snowfall occurs mainly in the winter months but can be observed even in May. There is a 40-day period of annual snowfall and an accumulation average of 70 m.<ref name=\"1a\"/>\n\nCem is affected by a continental climate in its upper part and a Mediterranean one as it reaches the Mora\u010da.<ref name=\"1a\" /> Annual temperature is around 6.8-7&nbsp;\u00b0C - January being the coldest month at -3&nbsp;\u00b0C and July the hottest at 15.7-20&nbsp;\u00b0C.

Shiroku and Juga are humid and warm southern winds that are associated with a rainy period.<ref name=\"1f\"/>\n\n== Discharge ==\nThe river's streamflow increases as tributaries and springs pour into it. Elevation and other morphological features also cause variations in its discharge. In general, the upper part of Cem in Albania has a lower discharge than the lower part in Montenergo, where Cem flows  through the canyon in a declining elevation after full tributary confluence.\n\nCem of Vuk\u00ebl contributes 10.2-10.5 m\u00b3/s to the river. Measurements at Tamar\u00eb, where the confluence with Cem of Selc\u00eb is located, show an average discharge of 13.99-14.4 m\u00b3/s. As the river passes into Montenegro near [[Grabom]] karstic springs in Dverbta and Brezhda increase its streamflow.<ref name=\"1a\" /> After this point the average discharge through the canyon is 24.86 m\u00b3/s, but as it crosses into the valley, it can drop even below 5 m\u00b3/s in the dry summer months. The maximal discharge rate of the river has been observed in May and has reached 41,6m\u00b3/s.<ref name=\"2c\" />\n\nCauses of the flow decrease are use in the water supply network and environmental factors linked to climate change. The climatic interruption of the water cycle has led to the cyclical decrease of rainfall, groundwater and karstic springs water yield to the river.<ref name=\"4b\">{{cite web |last1=Mitrovi\u0107 |first1=Luka |title=The impact of the climate change on the groundwater regime in the area of the Podgorica-Shkod\u00ebr Basin |url=https://issuu.com/regionalnivodovod/docs/waters_of_montenegro_-_volume_4 |publisher=Regionalni Vodovod Crnogorsko Primorje |accessdate=8 January 2020 |ref=4b}}</ref> This trend of flow decrease was observed in the Trgaj measurement station near Dinosha, in 2019, where summer flow was at a very low 3 m\u00b3/s.

Cem passes mostly through limestone terrain where many [[karst]]ic formations are observed. The terrain through which it flows in its {{convert|58.8|km}} course, is at an elevation of more than 1,200 m and can reach as low as 50 m. Throughout its declining elevation, it passes through narrow valleys and steep canyons, where waterfalls are formed before it reaches the Zeta plain.\n\nThe first cultural indicators of human settlement in the Cem river basin are from the late Copper Age and early Bronze Age (3500-2300 BC). In following millennia, Illyrian tribes, the Roman empire, Slavic principalities, the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire controlled the area. Today, the river is divided by Albania and Montenegro.\n\nCem is one of the last free-flowing rivers in Europe. The river's basin is a source of very high biodiversity for the two countries. In the recent decades, it is threatened by industrialization, the installation of small hydropower stations and the effects of climate change.\n\n== Name ==\n[[Ptolemy]] is the first to mention Cem as ''Kinna'' in ancient Greek and later in [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] a location named ''Cinna'' in Latin is connected to the river.

The river has two tributaries: Cem of [[Vuk\u00ebl]] (''Cemi i Vuklit'') and Cem of [[Selc\u00eb]] (''Cemi i Selc\u00ebs''), which join at the confluence of [[Tamar\u00eb]].<ref name=\"1a\">{{cite web |last1=Marojevi\u0107 Gali\u0107 |first1=Jelena |title=Plani i veprimit t\u00eb p\u00ebrbashk\u00ebt p\u00ebr mbrojtjen ekologjike t\u00eb lumit Cem dhe zhvillimi i qendruesh\u00ebm mjedisor n\u00eb zon\u00ebn nd\u00ebrkufitare [Mapping of common action plan for trans-border protection of Cem] |url=http://www.cemiriver.drupal.bildhosting.com/sites/cemiriver.me/files/field/publikacije/1.scientific_journal_albanian.pdf |website=GreenHome |publisher=Albania-Montenegro CrossBorder Cooperation Programme |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref> Cem of Vuk\u00ebl - the more important of the two in terms of water volume - rises at 900 m and flows for 17.9&nbsp;km. It passes through a narrow canyon, a terrain which widens only near [[Kozhnja]], where deposition has formed a small limestone valley. A creek called Cem of [[Nik\u00e7]] (''Cem i Nik\u00e7it'') also contributes to its flow volume except for the summer period when it runs dry.<ref name=\"1f\"/>\n\nCem of Selc\u00eb rises at 1,250 m on Mt. Bordolec near [[L\u00ebpush\u00eb]] and flows for 22.5&nbsp;km mostly through narrow limestone terrain until the valley of Tamar\u00eb.<ref name=\"1a\"/> In its course it passes through [[Gropat e Selc\u00ebs]] [[karstic cave]]s, the canyon of Gerrlla, 900 m long and 25 m deep, and the 30-meter high waterfall of Sllapi before Dobrinj\u00eb.\n\nAfter confluence, Cem flows generally southwest for {{convert|26.5|km}} and crosses into Montenegro, near Grabom.<ref name=\"1a\"/> A border crossing is also located after this village. Then the river flows through the villages of [[Tuzi|Tuzi municipality]] for {{convert|32.3|km}} before flowing into the [[Mora\u010da]] just south of [[Podgorica]] near Mitrovi\u0107i and [[Mojanovi\u0107i]].<ref name=\"1a\"/> The river and its terrain in Montenegro are divided into two parts. It firstly forms a steep canyon and then slowly crosses into the [[Zeta plain]], part of it called ''\u0106emovsko polje'' after the river. In the field, [[\u0160piro Mugo\u0161a Airport]] stands between Cem and [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]] and further west the [[Podgorica Airport]] is found. In this part, land occupation becomes more urbanized and industrialized.\n\nThe Cem canyon (''Kanjon Cijevne''/''Kanioni i Cemit'') is 12&nbsp;km long and has a depth of 903 m.<ref name=\"1g\"/> It is the natural habitat of many animal, insect and plant species. The canyon starts at the Albania-Montenegro border and forms a distinct geomorphological formation that crosses into \u0106emovsko polje roughly before [[Dinosha]] near Gurrec.\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Dinaric Alps subdivisions-fr.svg|thumb|Geomorphology of the Dinaric Alps. Cem is found in the Prokletije/Albanian Alps subdivision in B31]]\n\nThe geomorphological features of the Cem basin have their origin in the tectonic activity of the [[Alpine orogeny]], which formed the [[Dinaric Alps]] and its southern range, the [[Prokletije]] in the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic era up until today.<ref name=\"2c\"/> Specifically, the Cem basin is in the [[High Karst Unit]]. In this sub-unit, tectonic activity creates a vertical uplifting of landmasses and carbonate rocks are a large part of the landscape, which is defined by fluvial processes like the deposion of carbonate sediments by the river's streamflow. As the Prokletije have had glacial features, thus a high accumulutaion of water, the end of the Ice Age saw a general increase of Cem's discharge, which in turn enhanced fluvial processes in the basin.\n\nHeavy concentration of limestone has enabled the formation of [[Uvala (landform)|uvalas]], caves and other karst formations.<ref name=\"2c\"/> As water is retained in limestone, [[denudation]] of geological formations decreases.<ref name=\"1g\">{{cite journal |last1=Djurovi\u0107 |first1=Predrag |last2=Petrovi\u0107 |first2=Aleksandar |title=Large Canyons in Dinaric and Prokletije Mountains Region of Montenegro |journal=Geographica Pannonica |date=2007 |volume=11 |doi=10.5937/GeoPan0711014D |url=http://www.dgt.uns.ac.rs/pannonica/papers/volume11_03.pdf |accessdate=22 January 2020 |ref=1g}}</ref> The result of these interconnected processes is that Cem flows mostly through elevated, vertical and steep terrain that forms canyons, but crosses into small valleys where noncarbonate rocks have allowed horizontal erosion to take place like in the valley of Tamara. Then, the river exits high elevation areas and flows towards the Mora\u010da as the relief flattens and a [[polje]] is formed by karst processes.\n\n== Drainage Basin == \nThe drainage basin of Cem encompasses {{convert|368|km2|}} and is part of the Adriatic river basin along with other rivers that empty into [[Lake Skadar]], a total area of {{convert|6,560|km2|}}. 238&nbsp;km\u00b2 of the basin are in Albania, where the river and its tributaries originate, and 130&nbsp;km\u00b2 in Montenegro.<ref name=\"1a\" /> In the north, it borders the basin of Vermosh river and in the east that of L\u00ebpush\u00eb river. In the south, Cem's basin ends near [[Bog\u00eb, Albania|Bog\u00eb]].\n\nThe river's elevation ranges from above 1,250 m to no more than 50 m. Its elevation drop forms waterfalls of more than a 50-meter height in Montenegro. Annual precipitation is about 2,500&nbsp;mm - November being the highest point (361&nbsp;mm) and July the lowest (69.9&nbsp;mm). Snowfall occurs mainly in the winter months but can be observed even in May.

Elevation and other morphological features also cause variations in its discharge. In general, the upper part of Cem in Albania has a lower discharge than the lower part in Montenergo, where Cem flows  through the canyon in a declining elevation after full tributary confluence.\n\nCem of Vuk\u00ebl contributes 10.2-10.5 m\u00b3/s to the river. Measurements at Tamar\u00eb, where the confluence with Cem of Selc\u00eb is located, show an average discharge of 13.99-14.4 m\u00b3/s. As the river passes into Montenegro near [[Grabom]] karstic springs in Dverbta and Brezhda increase its streamflow.<ref name=\"1a\" /> After this point the average discharge through the canyon is 24.86 m\u00b3/s, but as it crosses into the valley, it can drop even below 5 m\u00b3/s in the dry summer months. The maximal discharge rate of the river has been observed in May and has reached 41,6m\u00b3/s.<ref name=\"2c\" />\n\nCauses of the flow decrease are use in the water supply network and environmental factors linked to climate change.

[[Buddah Records]] released the band's (and the label's) first album, 1967's ''[[Safe as Milk]]''. However, the label began specializing in [[bubblegum pop]], a style in which Captain Beefheart had no place, and the band again found themselves without a record label. In late 1967 and the spring of 1968, they had several sets of re-recording sessions for what became the albums ''[[Strictly Personal]]'' and ''[[Mirror Man (Captain Beefheart album)|Mirror Man]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.piccadillyrecords.com/counter/search.php?search=Captain+Beefheart+&+His+Magic+Band|title=Search Results for CAPTAIN BEEFHEART from Piccadilly Records|website=piccadillyrecords.com|access-date=August 8, 2017}}</ref> However, due to contractual uncertainties, they were uncertain if the material would ever be released. Around this time, Van Vliet's high school friend [[Frank Zappa]] started his own record labels [[Bizarre Records|Bizarre]] and [[Straight Records|Straight]], and offered Captain Beefheart, a name Zappa had given him, the opportunity to record an album with complete artistic freedom.\n\nIn preparation, the band rehearsed Van Vliet's difficult compositions for eight months, living [[commune (intentional community)|communally]] in a small rented house in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]]. Van Vliet implemented his vision by asserting complete artistic and emotional domination of his musicians.

These songs featured a lineup of Van Vliet, [[Zoot Horn Rollo|Bill Harkleroad]] and [[Jeff Cotton]] on guitar, [[John French (musician)|John French]] on drums, and Van Vliet's friend [[Gary Marker]] serving temporarily on bass as a replacement for the recently departed Jerry Handley. About a month later, [[Rockette Morton|Mark Boston]] joined the band as full-time bassist. The lineup of Van Vliet, Harkleroad, Cotton, French, and Boston recorded the rest of the tracks, with Van Vliet's cousin [[The Mascara Snake|Victor Hayden]] occasionally guesting on bass clarinet and vocals.\n\nZappa originally proposed to record the album as an \"ethnic field recording\" in the house where the band lived. Working with Zappa and engineer Dick Kunc, the band recorded some provisional backing tracks at the Woodland Hills house, with sound separation obtained simply by having different instruments in different rooms. Zappa thought these provisional recordings turned out well, but Van Vliet became suspicious that Zappa was trying to record the album on the cheap and insisted on using a professional studio. Zappa would say of Van Vliet's approach that it was \"impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It seemed to me that if he was going to create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not.\"<ref name=\"artist formerly known\">{{cite video |people=Elaine Shepard (Producer), Declan Smith (Film research) |year=1997 |title=The Artist Formerly Known as Captain Beefheart |medium=Documentary |publisher=BBC}}</ref> \"Hair Pie: Bake 1\", one of the tracks recorded by Zappa and Kunc at the house, appeared on the finished album. Three other tracks on the album were recorded on a cassette recorder at the house, the a cappella poems \"The Dust Blows Forward 'n The Dust Blows Back\" and \"Orange Claw Hammer\", and the improvised blues \"China Pig\" with former Magic Band member Doug Moon accompanying Van Vliet on guitar. \"The Blimp\" was recorded by Zappa in his studio while on the phone with Van Vliet prior to the album's sessions; Jeff Cotton was put on the phone to recite Van Vliet's latest poem, which Zappa recorded and put over a [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] backing track (which had been known to the Mothers, unacknowledged on ''Trout Mask''{{'}}s credits, as \"[[Charles Ives]]\").<ref>\n{{cite book| first=Kevin|last=Courier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSyUmDS4GicC&pg=PT88&lpg=PT88&dq=zappa+charles+ives+captain+beefheart&source=bl&ots=k1pCFeYinc&sig=ACfU3U37IHs5O3e06HVSkm6FpSwS2O1akQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWwYCV2qngAhVLwYMKHXeOA1A4ChDoATACegQIAhAB#v=onepage&q=zappa%20charles%20ives%20captain%20beefheart&f=false|title=Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|location=New York City|date=2007}}</ref>\n\nWhen they entered the studio, the band completed twenty instrumental tracks in a single six-hour recording session.<ref>{{cite book| last= Miles| first= Barry| authorlink= Barry Miles| year= 2005| title= Zappa: A Biography| pages= 182\u2013183| publisher= Grove Press| isbn= }}</ref> Van Vliet spent the next few days overdubbing the vocals. Instead of singing while monitoring the instrumental tracks over headphones, he heard only the slight sound leakage through the studio window.<ref name=\"Chusid\">{{cite book|first=Irwin|last=Chusid|authorlink=Irwin Chusid|title=Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music|date=2000|pages=129\u2013140|publisher=Cherry Red Books|location=London, England|ISBN=1-901447-11-1}}</ref> As a result, the vocals are only vaguely in sync with the instrumental backing; when asked later about synchronization, he remarked, \"That's what they do before a commando raid, isn't it?\"<ref>From ''Zig Zag'' magazine, No. 8, 1969 (as cited by M. Barnes in ''Captain Beefheart'')</ref>\n\nVan Vliet used the ensuing publicity, particularly with a 1970 ''Rolling Stone'' interview with [[Langdon Winner]], to promulgate a number of myths which were subsequently quoted as fact. Winner's article stated, for instance, that neither Van Vliet nor the members of the Magic Band ever took drugs, but Harkleroad and French later discredited this.<ref>French, pp. 291, 301</ref> Van Vliet also claimed to have taught both Harkleroad and Mark Boston from scratch; in fact, the pair were already accomplished musicians before joining the band.<ref name=\"Chusid\"/> Van Vliet also took complete credit for composition and arranging, a claim that band members strongly disputed in later years.<ref>French pp. 356\u2013387</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nAccording to Van Vliet, all of the songs on the album were written in a single eight-hour session. Band members have stated that two of the songs (\"[[Moonlight on Vermont]]\" and \"Sugar 'n Spikes\") were written around December 1967, while \"Veteran's Day Poppy\" was written around late May or early June 1968. Most of the rest were composed over a period of several months in the summer and fall of 1968 in an unprecedented process of experimentation. One influence on the compositional process was a tape that Van Vliet's friend Gary Marker had played for him. Marker, an aspiring [[recording engineer]], was learning how to [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording#Description|splice]] audio tape. He practiced by combining sections of various recordings so that they would join smoothly and maintain a consistent beat despite being from different sources. When Van Vliet heard the tape, he said excitedly, \"''That's'' what I want!\"<ref>{{cite video|title=Captain Beefheart: Under Review|year=2006|publisher=Music Video Distributors}}</ref>\n\nVan Vliet used a piano, an instrument he had never played before, as his main compositional tool. Since he had no experience with the piano and no conventional musical knowledge at all, he was able to experiment with few preconceived ideas of musical form or structure. Van Vliet sat at the piano until he found a rhythmic or melodic pattern that he liked. John French then transcribed this pattern, typically only a measure or two long, into musical notation. After Van Vliet was finished, French would then piece these fragments together into compositions, reminiscent of the splicing together of disparate source material on Marker's tape. French decided which part would be played on which instrument and taught each player their part, although Van Vliet had the final say over the ultimate shape of the product. Band member Bill Harkleroad has remarked on \"how haphazardly the individual parts were done, worked on very surgically, stuck together, and then sculpted afterwards\". Once completed, each song was played in exactly the same way every time, eschewing the [[improvisation]] that typifies most popular music in favor of an approach more like a formal, [[classical music|classical]] composition.\n\nFrench has stated that about three-quarters of the songs were composed at the piano. The rest mostly consisted of parts that were whistled by Van Vliet. In a few cases, part of the song was composed at the piano while others were whistled. Three of the pieces were unaccompanied vocal solos (\"Well\", \"The Dust Blows Forward and the Dust Blows Back\", and \"Orange Claw Hammer\") while one was a spontaneous improvisation (\"China Pig\"). \"Bill's Corpse\" was titled for the emaciated condition that Bill Harkleroad suffered before leaving an LSD cult to join the band, and possibly to similar conditions Van Vliet created within the band's house.<ref>French, pp. 802\u2013803</ref> Van Vliet called the song \"Dali's Car\" a \"study in dissonance\".<ref>French, pp. 805\u2013806</ref> \"Hobo Chang Ba\" was based on Van Vliet's stories \"as a young teenager in Mojave of going down and hanging with the hobos. He said they were really nice people and he got to know the regulars.\"<ref>French, p. 810</ref> Drummer John French states of \"Old Fart at Play\", \"[it] was never intended to have these lyrics. This is the only other time I saw Zappa aggressively put on his 'producer's hat' and assert his will on Don. The original title to this song was 'My Business Is the Truth, Your Business Is a Lie'.\"<ref>French, p. 813</ref>\n\nSeveral of the compositions include brief passages from other songs. Some were childhood reminiscences, such as [[Gene Autry]]'s recording \"El Rancho Grande\", from which one of the guitar lines in \"Veteran's Day Poppy\" was adapted, or the \"[[Shortnin' Bread]]\" melody used in \"Pachuco Cadaver\". Others were more contemporary, such as the quote \"come out to show dem [them]\" from [[Steve Reich]]'s \"[[Come Out (Reich)|Come Out]]\" used in \"Moonlight on Vermont\", or a melodic fragment from the [[Miles Davis]] recording of ''[[Concierto De Aranjuez#Interpretations|Concierto de Aranjuez]]'' used as the basis for the bridge of \"Sugar 'n Spikes\". The ending of \"Moonlight on Vermont\" also includes the refrain from the spiritual \"[[Old-Time Religion]]\". A nonmusical influence was the art of [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]; the instrumental \"Dali's Car\" was inspired by the band's viewing of an installation of Dal\u00ed's ''[[Rainy Taxi]]''.<ref>[https://www.theodysseyonline.com/captain-beefhearts-trout-mask-replica-an-astonishingly-puzzling-adventure Captain Beefheart's 'Trout Mask Replica': An Astonishingly Puzzling Adventure - Odyssey]</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=AllMusic review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/trout-mask-replica-mw0000202766|website=AllMusic|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|page=3074|title=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|year=2011|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th|isbn=978-0857125958|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev3score = 10/10<ref>{{cite web|title=Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band - Trout Mask Replica Review |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/captain-beefheart-and-his-magic-band-trout-mask-replica/|work=Pitchfork|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating |5|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Q|date= November 1994|url= http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=60266257&loc=109&PageFormat=7|magazine= [[Q (magazine)|Q]]|page= 136|archive-url= https://archive.today/20130102044719/http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=60266257&loc=109&PageFormat=7|archive-date= January 2, 2013|access-date= February 5, 2018|url-status= dead}}</ref>\n| rev5 = [[Rolling Stone]] \n| rev5Score = ''(favorable)''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bangs |first=Lester |date=July 26, 1969 |title=Trout Mask Replica |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/trout-mask-replica-19690726 |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=38 |pages=37 |location=San Francisco |publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers, Inc. |accessdate=September 10, 2015 }}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev6Score = {{Rating |5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Rolling Stone Album Guide \u2013 5 Star Record List 1983|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rs5star_ed1.htm|work=Rocklist.net|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Trout Mask Replica'' is considered to be Captain Beefheart's [[Masterpiece|''magnum opus'']],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&pg=PT177|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|last=Buckley|first=Peter|date=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=9781843531050|language=en}}</ref> and has appeared on lists of the greatest albums of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://acclaimedmusic.net/album/A154.htm|title=Acclaimed Music|website=acclaimedmusic.net|access-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref> [[BBC]] [[disc jockey]] [[John Peel]] said of the album, \"If there has been anything in the history of popular music which could be described as a work of art in a way that people who are involved in other areas of art would understand, then ''Trout Mask Replica'' is probably that work.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.furious.com/Perfect/beefheart/troutmaskreplica3.html |title=Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band: ''Trout Mask Replica'' |accessdate=December 9, 2007 |last=Barnes |first=Mike |date=February 1999 |publisher=Perfect Sound Forever |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120133945/http://www.furious.com/Perfect/beefheart/troutmaskreplica3.html |archive-date=November 20, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Lester Bangs]] wrote that \"it was not even 'ahead' of its time in 1969.

1969, by [[Straight Records]]. Combining elements of [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]], [[garage rock]], and [[blues]] with [[free jazz]], [[avant-garde]] approaches, and other genres of [[Music of the United States|American music]],<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> the album is regarded as an important work of [[experimental music]] and [[art rock]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Simon|last=Vozick-Levinson|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2010/12/17/captain-beefheart-dies|title=Captain Beefheart, a.k.a.

The lineup of the Magic Band at this time consisted of [[Zoot Horn Rollo|Bill Harkleroad]] and [[Jeff Cotton]] on guitar, [[Mark Boston]] on bass guitar, [[The Mascara Snake|Victor Hayden]] on [[bass clarinet]], and [[John French (musician)|John French]] on drums and percussion. Beefheart played several brass and woodwind instruments, including saxophone, [[Piccolo oboe|musette]], and [[natural horn]], and contributed most of the vocal parts, while Zappa and members of the band provided occasional vocals and narration. The well-rehearsed Magic Band recorded all instrumental tracks<ref group=a>Excluding the \"home recordings\" and \"Moonlight on Vermont\" and \"Veteran's Day Poppy\", recorded in 1968</ref> for the album in a single six-hour recording session; Van Vliet's vocal and horn tracks were laid down over the next few days.\n\n''Trout Mask Replica'' sold poorly upon its initial release in the United States, where it failed to appear in any charts. It was more successful in the United Kingdom, where it spent a week at number 21 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"UK Charts\">{{cite book|first1=Tony|last1=Brown|first2=Tony|last2=Kutner|first3=Neil|last3=Warwick|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts: Singles & Albums|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|date=2004|page=205}}</ref> In recent years, however, ''Trout Mask Replica'' has been widely regarded as the masterpiece of Van Vliet's musical career, as well as an important influence on many subsequent artists.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Its highly unconventional musical style, which includes [[polyrhythm]], multi-octave vocals, and [[polytonality]], continues to polarize audiences and has given the album a reputation as one of the most challenging recordings in the 20th century musical canon. It was ranked number 60 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] list (revised in 2012), and it appears on many similar lists including [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]'s ''[[All Time Top 1000 Albums]]'' where it was voted number 50 in the 3rd Edition (2000). Larkin wrote \". . . a challenging and unbelievable record\". \"[[AllMusic]]'s Steve Huey wrote that \"its inspiring reimagining of what was possible in a rock context laid the groundwork for countless future experiments in rock [[surrealism]], especially during the [[punk rock|punk]]/[[new wave music|new wave]] era\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\n==Background==\nCaptain Beefheart and his Magic Band had a history of difficult relationships with record labels. [[A&M Records]] released the band's first single, a cover of [[Bo Diddley]]'s \"[[Diddy Wah Diddy]]\", but dropped the contract after their first two singles failed to produce hits. [[Buddah Records]] released the band's (and the label's) first album, 1967's ''[[Safe as Milk]]''. However, the label began specializing in [[bubblegum pop]], a style in which Captain Beefheart had no place, and the band again found themselves without a record label. In late 1967 and the spring of 1968, they had several sets of re-recording sessions for what became the albums ''[[Strictly Personal]]'' and ''[[Mirror Man (Captain Beefheart album)|Mirror Man]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.piccadillyrecords.com/counter/search.php?search=Captain+Beefheart+&+His+Magic+Band|title=Search Results for CAPTAIN BEEFHEART from Piccadilly Records|website=piccadillyrecords.com|access-date=August 8, 2017}}</ref> However, due to contractual uncertainties, they were uncertain if the material would ever be released. Around this time, Van Vliet's high school friend [[Frank Zappa]] started his own record labels [[Bizarre Records|Bizarre]] and [[Straight Records|Straight]], and offered Captain Beefheart, a name Zappa had given him, the opportunity to record an album with complete artistic freedom.\n\nIn preparation, the band rehearsed Van Vliet's difficult compositions for eight months, living [[commune (intentional community)|communally]] in a small rented house in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]]. Van Vliet implemented his vision by asserting complete artistic and emotional domination of his musicians. At various times, one or another of the band members were put \"in the barrel\", with Van Vliet berating him continually, sometimes for days, until the musician collapsed in tears or in total submission to Van Vliet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vpinterviews.blogspot.com/2005/04/magic-band.html |title=vanity project interviews: The Magic Band |publisher=Vpinterviews.blogspot.com |date=April 21, 2005 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref> According to [[John French (musician)|John French]] and Bill Harkleroad, these sessions often included physical violence. French described the situation as \"cultlike\",<ref name=\"Lewis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beefheart.com/datharp/drumbo/paullewis.htm|title=Burundo Drumbi! \u2013 John French's Series of Q&As, 2000/1|accessdate=December 9, 2007|publisher=The Captain Beefheart Radar Station|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213094110/http://www.beefheart.com/datharp/drumbo/paullewis.htm|archivedate=December 13, 2007}}</ref> and a visiting friend said that \"the environment in that house was positively [[Charles Manson|Manson]]-esque\".<ref>Barnes, Mike. ''Captain Beefheart''. Quartet Books, {{ISBN|0-7043-8073-0}}.</ref> Their material circumstances also were dire. With no income other than [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and contributions from relatives, the band survived on a bare subsistence diet. French recounted living on no more than a small cup of soybeans a day for a month,<ref name=\"artist formerly known\"/> and at one point, band members were arrested for shoplifting food (with Zappa bailing them out).{{sfn |French|2010| pp=389\u2013391}} A visitor described their appearance as \"cadaverous\" and said that \"they all looked in poor health\". Band members were restricted from leaving the house and practiced for fourteen or more hours a day. Van Vliet once told drummer John French that he had been diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]], and he would see nonexistent conspiracies that explained this behavior.<ref name=\"Zappafripp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/teejo/argue/johndress.html|title=captain beefheart \u2013 interview magic band member \u2013 drumbo's old dress (part of 'french redressing') \u2013 2004|last=teejo|accessdate=September 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\n\"Moonlight on Vermont\" and \"Veteran's Day Poppy\" were recorded at [[Sunset Sound Recorders]] in August 1968, about seven months before the rest of the songs. These songs featured a lineup of Van Vliet, [[Zoot Horn Rollo|Bill Harkleroad]] and [[Jeff Cotton]] on guitar, [[John French (musician)|John French]] on drums, and Van Vliet's friend [[Gary Marker]] serving temporarily on bass as a replacement for the recently departed Jerry Handley. About a month later, [[Rockette Morton|Mark Boston]] joined the band as full-time bassist. The lineup of Van Vliet, Harkleroad, Cotton, French, and Boston recorded the rest of the tracks, with Van Vliet's cousin [[The Mascara Snake|Victor Hayden]] occasionally guesting on bass clarinet and vocals.\n\nZappa originally proposed to record the album as an \"ethnic field recording\" in the house where the band lived. Working with Zappa and engineer Dick Kunc, the band recorded some provisional backing tracks at the Woodland Hills house, with sound separation obtained simply by having different instruments in different rooms. Zappa thought these provisional recordings turned out well, but Van Vliet became suspicious that Zappa was trying to record the album on the cheap and insisted on using a professional studio. Zappa would say of Van Vliet's approach that it was \"impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It seemed to me that if he was going to create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not.\"<ref name=\"artist formerly known\">{{cite video |people=Elaine Shepard (Producer), Declan Smith (Film research) |year=1997 |title=The Artist Formerly Known as Captain Beefheart |medium=Documentary |publisher=BBC}}</ref> \"Hair Pie: Bake 1\", one of the tracks recorded by Zappa and Kunc at the house, appeared on the finished album. Three other tracks on the album were recorded on a cassette recorder at the house, the a cappella poems \"The Dust Blows Forward 'n The Dust Blows Back\" and \"Orange Claw Hammer\", and the improvised blues \"China Pig\" with former Magic Band member Doug Moon accompanying Van Vliet on guitar. \"The Blimp\" was recorded by Zappa in his studio while on the phone with Van Vliet prior to the album's sessions; Jeff Cotton was put on the phone to recite Van Vliet's latest poem, which Zappa recorded and put over a [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] backing track (which had been known to the Mothers, unacknowledged on ''Trout Mask''{{'}}s credits, as \"[[Charles Ives]]\").<ref>\n{{cite book| first=Kevin|last=Courier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSyUmDS4GicC&pg=PT88&lpg=PT88&dq=zappa+charles+ives+captain+beefheart&source=bl&ots=k1pCFeYinc&sig=ACfU3U37IHs5O3e06HVSkm6FpSwS2O1akQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWwYCV2qngAhVLwYMKHXeOA1A4ChDoATACegQIAhAB#v=onepage&q=zappa%20charles%20ives%20captain%20beefheart&f=false|title=Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|location=New York City|date=2007}}</ref>\n\nWhen they entered the studio, the band completed twenty instrumental tracks in a single six-hour recording session.<ref>{{cite book| last= Miles| first= Barry| authorlink= Barry Miles| year= 2005| title= Zappa: A Biography| pages= 182\u2013183| publisher= Grove Press| isbn= }}</ref> Van Vliet spent the next few days overdubbing the vocals. Instead of singing while monitoring the instrumental tracks over headphones, he heard only the slight sound leakage through the studio window.<ref name=\"Chusid\">{{cite book|first=Irwin|last=Chusid|authorlink=Irwin Chusid|title=Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music|date=2000|pages=129\u2013140|publisher=Cherry Red Books|location=London, England|ISBN=1-901447-11-1}}</ref> As a result, the vocals are only vaguely in sync with the instrumental backing; when asked later about synchronization, he remarked, \"That's what they do before a commando raid, isn't it?\"<ref>From ''Zig Zag'' magazine, No. 8, 1969 (as cited by M. Barnes in ''Captain Beefheart'')</ref>\n\nVan Vliet used the ensuing publicity, particularly with a 1970 ''Rolling Stone'' interview with [[Langdon Winner]], to promulgate a number of myths which were subsequently quoted as fact. Winner's article stated, for instance, that neither Van Vliet nor the members of the Magic Band ever took drugs, but Harkleroad and French later discredited this.<ref>French, pp. 291, 301</ref> Van Vliet also claimed to have taught both Harkleroad and Mark Boston from scratch; in fact, the pair were already accomplished musicians before joining the band.<ref name=\"Chusid\"/> Van Vliet also took complete credit for composition and arranging, a claim that band members strongly disputed in later years.<ref>French pp. 356\u2013387</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nAccording to Van Vliet, all of the songs on the album were written in a single eight-hour session. Band members have stated that two of the songs (\"[[Moonlight on Vermont]]\" and \"Sugar 'n Spikes\") were written around December 1967, while \"Veteran's Day Poppy\" was written around late May or early June 1968. Most of the rest were composed over a period of several months in the summer and fall of 1968 in an unprecedented process of experimentation. One influence on the compositional process was a tape that Van Vliet's friend Gary Marker had played for him. Marker, an aspiring [[recording engineer]], was learning how to [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording#Description|splice]] audio tape. He practiced by combining sections of various recordings so that they would join smoothly and maintain a consistent beat despite being from different sources. When Van Vliet heard the tape, he said excitedly, \"''That's'' what I want!\"<ref>{{cite video|title=Captain Beefheart: Under Review|year=2006|publisher=Music Video Distributors}}</ref>\n\nVan Vliet used a piano, an instrument he had never played before, as his main compositional tool. Since he had no experience with the piano and no conventional musical knowledge at all, he was able to experiment with few preconceived ideas of musical form or structure. Van Vliet sat at the piano until he found a rhythmic or melodic pattern that he liked. John French then transcribed this pattern, typically only a measure or two long, into musical notation. After Van Vliet was finished, French would then piece these fragments together into compositions, reminiscent of the splicing together of disparate source material on Marker's tape. French decided which part would be played on which instrument and taught each player their part, although Van Vliet had the final say over the ultimate shape of the product. Band member Bill Harkleroad has remarked on \"how haphazardly the individual parts were done, worked on very surgically, stuck together, and then sculpted afterwards\". Once completed, each song was played in exactly the same way every time, eschewing the [[improvisation]] that typifies most popular music in favor of an approach more like a formal, [[classical music|classical]] composition.\n\nFrench has stated that about three-quarters of the songs were composed at the piano. The rest mostly consisted of parts that were whistled by Van Vliet. In a few cases, part of the song was composed at the piano while others were whistled. Three of the pieces were unaccompanied vocal solos (\"Well\", \"The Dust Blows Forward and the Dust Blows Back\", and \"Orange Claw Hammer\") while one was a spontaneous improvisation (\"China Pig\"). \"Bill's Corpse\" was titled for the emaciated condition that Bill Harkleroad suffered before leaving an LSD cult to join the band, and possibly to similar conditions Van Vliet created within the band's house.<ref>French, pp. 802\u2013803</ref> Van Vliet called the song \"Dali's Car\" a \"study in dissonance\".<ref>French, pp. 805\u2013806</ref> \"Hobo Chang Ba\" was based on Van Vliet's stories \"as a young teenager in Mojave of going down and hanging with the hobos. He said they were really nice people and he got to know the regulars.\"<ref>French, p. 810</ref> Drummer John French states of \"Old Fart at Play\", \"[it] was never intended to have these lyrics. This is the only other time I saw Zappa aggressively put on his 'producer's hat' and assert his will on Don. The original title to this song was 'My Business Is the Truth, Your Business Is a Lie'.\"<ref>French, p. 813</ref>\n\nSeveral of the compositions include brief passages from other songs. Some were childhood reminiscences, such as [[Gene Autry]]'s recording \"El Rancho Grande\", from which one of the guitar lines in \"Veteran's Day Poppy\" was adapted, or the \"[[Shortnin' Bread]]\" melody used in \"Pachuco Cadaver\". Others were more contemporary, such as the quote \"come out to show dem [them]\" from [[Steve Reich]]'s \"[[Come Out (Reich)|Come Out]]\" used in \"Moonlight on Vermont\", or a melodic fragment from the [[Miles Davis]] recording of ''[[Concierto De Aranjuez#Interpretations|Concierto de Aranjuez]]'' used as the basis for the bridge of \"Sugar 'n Spikes\". The ending of \"Moonlight on Vermont\" also includes the refrain from the spiritual \"[[Old-Time Religion]]\". A nonmusical influence was the art of [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]; the instrumental \"Dali's Car\" was inspired by the band's viewing of an installation of Dal\u00ed's ''[[Rainy Taxi]]''.<ref>[https://www.theodysseyonline.com/captain-beefhearts-trout-mask-replica-an-astonishingly-puzzling-adventure Captain Beefheart's 'Trout Mask Replica': An Astonishingly Puzzling Adventure - Odyssey]</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=AllMusic review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/trout-mask-replica-mw0000202766|website=AllMusic|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|page=3074|title=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|year=2011|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th|isbn=978-0857125958|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev3score = 10/10<ref>{{cite web|title=Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band - Trout Mask Replica Review |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/captain-beefheart-and-his-magic-band-trout-mask-replica/|work=Pitchfork|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating |5|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Q|date= November 1994|url= http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=60266257&loc=109&PageFormat=7|magazine= [[Q (magazine)|Q]]|page= 136|archive-url= https://archive.today/20130102044719/http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=60266257&loc=109&PageFormat=7|archive-date= January 2, 2013|access-date= February 5, 2018|url-status= dead}}</ref>\n| rev5 = [[Rolling Stone]] \n| rev5Score = ''(favorable)''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bangs |first=Lester |date=July 26, 1969 |title=Trout Mask Replica |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/trout-mask-replica-19690726 |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=38 |pages=37 |location=San Francisco |publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers, Inc. |accessdate=September 10, 2015 }}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev6Score = {{Rating |5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Rolling Stone Album Guide \u2013 5 Star Record List 1983|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rs5star_ed1.htm|work=Rocklist.net|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Trout Mask Replica'' is considered to be Captain Beefheart's [[Masterpiece|''magnum opus'']],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&pg=PT177|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|last=Buckley|first=Peter|date=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=9781843531050|language=en}}</ref> and has appeared on lists of the greatest albums of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://acclaimedmusic.net/album/A154.htm|title=Acclaimed Music|website=acclaimedmusic.net|access-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref> [[BBC]] [[disc jockey]] [[John Peel]] said of the album, \"If there has been anything in the history of popular music which could be described as a work of art in a way that people who are involved in other areas of art would understand, then ''Trout Mask Replica'' is probably that work.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.furious.com/Perfect/beefheart/troutmaskreplica3.html |title=Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band: ''Trout Mask Replica'' |accessdate=December 9, 2007 |last=Barnes |first=Mike |date=February 1999 |publisher=Perfect Sound Forever |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120133945/http://www.furious.com/Perfect/beefheart/troutmaskreplica3.html |archive-date=November 20, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Lester Bangs]] wrote that \"it was not even 'ahead' of its time in 1969.
