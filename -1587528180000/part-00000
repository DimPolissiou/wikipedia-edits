In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]].

The first is as the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> The [[verb phrase]] can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the [[simple present]] or the [[simple past]]. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, [[noun phrase|noun phrases]] are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua|Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker usually appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare the following languages:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

She '''went''' \"Who are you going with?\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n:: d. He''''s all''' \"Okay, come with me come with me\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\nIn conversational speech, the use of ''say'' and ''be like'' occurs at about the same frequency,<ref name=\"frederica\"/> though ''say'' tends to be used in more formal contexts (e.g. office hours between professors and students) and ''be like'' tends to occur in more informal contexts (e.g. a conversation between two young people).<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\n=====Japanese=====\n\nIn Japanese, the quotative particle ''to'' along with the verb of saying ''iu'' (say) occur after the quotation; the conjugated form of ''iu'' (say) is ''itta'':<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker ACC=Accusative COM=Complementizer HON=Honorific/Polite form\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u592a\u90ce || \u306f || \u6674\u6d77\u3000|| \u3092 || \u618e\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n|-\n| Taro || wa || Harumi || o || nikundeiru || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Taro || TOP || Harumi || ACC || hated || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''Taro said that he hated Harumi.''\" lit. \"''that 'I hated Harumi'''\"\n|}\n\nThe quotative particle ''to'' can also occur with verbs of thinking, such as ''omou'' (think). Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n=====Laal=====\n\nIn [[Laal language|Laal]], the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' is used for non-self quotation<ref name=\"laal\"/> (i.e. quotation in which the speaker quotes someone else, not themself); it is used with a quotative verb ''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''. The use of ''m\u0268\u0301'' results in an indirect quotation translation. The quotative verb ''b\u0268\u0301l\u00e1'' occurs before the quotation, while the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' occurs within the quoted speech ''j\u00e1 m\u0268\u0301 ny\u00e0g t\u0101\u0101 w\u00f3'':\n\nGloss: QEV=Quotative Evidential NEG=Negation\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u00e0<sub>i</sub> || '''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''' || m\u0268\u0301\u3000|| j\u00e1<sub>*i/j</sub> || '''m\u0268\u0301''' || ny\u00e0g || t\u0101\u0101 || w\u00f3 <ref name=\"laal\"/>\n|-\n| He || '''say''' || (say)that || I || '''QEV''' || eat || fish || NEG\n|-\n| colspan=8|\"''He<sub>i</sub> said that I<sub>*i/j</sub> don't/didn't eat fish.''\"\n|}\n\nAs the above sentence involves a non-self quotation, ''\u00e0'' (he) and ''j\u00e1'' (I) have different indices to show that they refer to different [[referent|referents]]; only this interpretation is [[well-formedness|well-formed]]. The interpretation in which they share identical indices is ill-formed (i.e. ungrammatical), as indicated by the asterisk.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation.

In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]].

The first is as the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> The [[verb phrase]] can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the [[simple present]] or the [[simple past]]. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, [[noun phrase|noun phrases]] are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua|Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker usually appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare the following languages:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n=====Laal=====\n\nIn [[Laal language|Laal]], the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' is used for non-self quotation<ref name=\"laal\"/> (i.e. quotation in which the speaker quotes someone else, not themself); it is used with a quotative verb ''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''. The use of ''m\u0268\u0301'' results in an indirect quotation translation. The quotative verb ''b\u0268\u0301l\u00e1'' occurs before the quotation, while the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' occurs within the quoted speech ''j\u00e1 m\u0268\u0301 ny\u00e0g t\u0101\u0101 w\u00f3'':\n\nGloss: QEV=Quotative Evidential NEG=Negation\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u00e0<sub>i</sub> || '''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''' || m\u0268\u0301\u3000|| j\u00e1<sub>*i/j</sub> || '''m\u0268\u0301''' || ny\u00e0g || t\u0101\u0101 || w\u00f3 <ref name=\"laal\"/>\n|-\n| He || '''say''' || (say)that || I || '''QEV''' || eat || fish || NEG\n|-\n| colspan=8|\"''He<sub>i</sub> said that I<sub>*i/j</sub> don't/didn't eat fish.''\"\n|}\n\nAs the above sentence involves a non-self quotation, ''\u00e0'' (he) and ''j\u00e1'' (I) have different indices to show that they refer to different [[referent|referents]]; only this interpretation is [[well-formedness|well-formed]]. The interpretation in which they share identical indices is ill-formed (i.e. ungrammatical), as indicated by the asterisk.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation. It differs from the English structures in that it uses an overt quantifier ''zoiets'' to be [[grammaticality|well-formed]].<ref name=\"haddican et al\">{{cite journal |last1=Haddican |first1=William |last2=Zweig |first2=Eytan |last3=Johnson |first3=Daniel Ezra |title=The syntax of be like quotatives |journal=Proceedings of the 29th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics |date=2012 |page=81-89 |url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/29/paper2690.pdf}}</ref>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways: through grammatical marking, additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or systematic affixes of verbs. Quotative readings of evidentials are typologically rare. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows  the source of the quotation is from elsewhere, but this is not a quotative reading as there is no direct performative quoting or verbs of saying.

Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes).

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading.

Teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, and the second worst picking second and so on. The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous [[Super Bowl]]; the Super Bowl champion ''always'' picks last, and the Super Bowl loser ''always'' picks second last. Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof.  Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://football.about.com/od/miscinformation/a/detdraftorder.htm| last = Alder | first = James | title = NFL Draft Basics:Determining Order of Selection | work = football.about.com | accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Colts have selected the number one overall pick in the draft on seven separate occasions, one of which was used to select [[Super Bowl MVP|Super Bowl XLI MVP]] [[Peyton Manning]].

The team's most recent first round selection was Malik Hooker, a safety from Ohio State in the [[2017 NFL Draft]].\n\nEvery year during April, each NFL franchise seeks to add new players to its roster through a collegiate [[draft (sports)|draft]] officially known as the [[NFL Draft|NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting]] but more commonly known as the NFL Draft. Teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, and the second worst picking second and so on. The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous [[Super Bowl]]; the Super Bowl champion ''always'' picks last, and the Super Bowl loser ''always'' picks second last. Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof.  Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://football.about.com/od/miscinformation/a/detdraftorder.htm| last = Alder | first = James | title = NFL Draft Basics:Determining Order of Selection | work = football.about.com | accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Colts have selected the number one overall pick in the draft on seven separate occasions, one of which was used to select [[Super Bowl MVP|Super Bowl XLI MVP]] [[Peyton Manning]].  They have also selected the second overall pick five times and the third overall pick twice.  The team's five selections from Ohio State University are the most chosen by the Colts from one university.\n\n==Key==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n! scope=\"row\"

Pritam asks to record and witness the miserable condition of Punjab and its people after [[Partition of India|partition]] (1947) and open a new page of his book of love. In the story of ''Heer Ranjha'', Shah narrated the misery of a woman (Heer), but a million of daughters of Punjab, Pritam feels, were crying to Shah.\n\nThe fields are lines up with dead bodies, and [[Chenab River|Chenab]] is filled with blood. Someone unknown poured poison in the water of the five rivers, and the deadly water is destroying the land. The land, which used to be fertile, is sprouting venom, and the sky has turned red from endless cries and tears.\n\n==Excerpt==\nThese are the opening lines of the poem:<ref>[http://apnaorg.com/poetry/amrita-r/ Amrita Pritam] Academy of the Punjab in North America (APNA).</ref><ref>[http://www.apnaorg.com/audio/amrita/ Ajj Aakhan Waris Shah Nu- Poetry in Amrita's Own Voice] Academy of the Punjab in North America (APNA).</ref>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"6\"\n!'''Punjabi - [[Gurmukhi]] script'''\n!'''Punjabi - [[Shahmukhi]] script'''\n!'''English translation'''\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|\n'''\u0a05\u0a71\u0a1c \u0a06\u0a16\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a35\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a38 \u0a38\u0a3c\u0a3e\u0a39 \u0a28\u0a42\u0a70 \u0a15\u0a3f\u0a24\u0a4b\u0a02 \u0a15\u0a2c\u0a30\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a35\u0a3f\u0a1a\u0a4b\u0a02 \u0a2c\u0a4b\u0a32\u0964'''<br>\n'''\u0a24\u0a47 \u0a05\u0a71\u0a1c \u0a15\u0a3f\u0a24\u0a3e\u0a2c\u0a47 \u0a07\u0a38\u0a3c\u0a15 \u0a26\u0a3e \u0a15\u0a4b\u0a08 \u0a05\u0a17\u0a32\u0a3e \u0a35\u0a30\u0a15\u0a3e \u0a2b\u0a4b\u0a32\u0964'''<br>\n'''\u0a07\u0a15 \u0a30\u0a4b\u0a08 \u0a38\u0a40 \u0a27\u0a40 \u0a2a\u0a70\u0a1c\u0a3e\u0a2c \u0a26\u0a40 \u0a24\u0a42\u0a70 \u0a32\u0a3f\u0a16 \u0a32\u0a3f\u0a16 \u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a47 \u0a35\u0a48\u0a23\u0964'''<br>\n'''\u0a05\u0a1c \u0a32\u0a71\u0a16\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a27\u0a40\u0a06\u0a02 \u0a30\u0a4b\u0a02\u0a26\u0a40\u0a06\u0a02 \u0a24\u0a48\u0a28\u0a42 \u0a35\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a38 \u0a38\u0a3c\u0a3e\u0a39 \u0a28\u0a42\u0a70 \u0a15\u0a39\u0a3f\u0a23\u0964'''<br>\n'''\u0a35\u0a47 \u0a26\u0a30\u0a26\u0a2e\u0a70\u0a26\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a26\u0a3f\u0a06 \u0a26\u0a30\u0a26\u0a40\u0a06 \u0a09\u0a71\u0a20 \u0a24\u0a71\u0a15 \u0a06\u0a2a\u0a23\u0a3e \u0a2a\u0a70\u0a1c\u0a3e\u0a2c\u0964'''<br>\n'''\u0a05\u0a1c \u0a2c\u0a47\u0a32\u0a47 \u0a32\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a3c\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a35\u0a3f\u0a1b\u0a40\u0a06\u0a02 \u0a24\u0a47 \u0a32\u0a39\u0a42 \u0a26\u0a40 \u0a2d\u0a30\u0a40 \u0a1a\u0a28\u0a3e\u0a2c\u0964'''<br>\n|\n{{nq|\u0627\u062c \u0622\u06a9\u06be\u0627\u06ba \u0648\u0627\u0631\u062b \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0646\u0648\u06ba\u060c \u06a9\u062a\u06be\u0648\u06ba \u0642\u0628\u0631\u0627\u06ba \u0648\u0686\u0648\u06ba \u0628\u0648\u0644<br>\n\u062a\u06d2 \u0627\u062c \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0650 \u0639\u0634\u0642 \u062f\u0627 \u06a9\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0627\u06af\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u0631\u0642\u06c1 \u067e\u064e\u06be\u0648\u0644<br>\n\u0627\u06a9 \u0631\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0633\u06cc \u062f\u06be\u06cc \u067e\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0628 \u062f\u06cc\u060c \u062a\u064f\u0648\u06ba \u0644\u06a9\u06be \u0644\u06a9\u06be \u0645\u0627\u0631\u06d2 \u0648\u06cc\u0646<br>\n\u0627\u062c \u0644\u06a9\u06be\u0627\u06ba \u062f\u06be\u06cc\u0627\u06ba \u0631\u0648\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u0627\u06ba\u060c \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0648\u06ba \u0648\u0627\u0631\u062b \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0646\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u06c1\u0646<br>\n\u0627\u064f\u0679\u06be \u062f\u0631\u062f \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0627\u06ba \u062f\u06cc\u0627 \u062f\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u0627\u060c \u0627\u064f\u0679\u06be \u0648\u06cc\u06a9\u06be \u0627\u067e\u0646\u0627 \u067e\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0628<br>\n\u0627\u062c \u0628\u06cc\u0644\u06d2 \u0644\u0627\u0634\u0627\u06ba \u0648\u0686\u06be\u06cc\u0627\u06ba \u062a\u06d2 \u0644\u06c1\u0648 \u062f\u06cc \u0628\u06be\u0631\u06cc \u0686\u0646\u0627\u0628}}\n|\nToday, I call Waris Shah, \u201cSpeak from your grave,\u201d<br>\nAnd turn to the next page in your book of love,<br>\nOnce, a daughter of Punjab cried and you wrote an entire saga,<br>\nToday, a million daughters cry out to you, Waris Shah,<br>\nRise!

Pritam asks to record and witness the miserable condition of Punjab and its people after [[Partition of India|partition]] (1947) and open a new page of his book of love. In the story of ''Heer Ranjha'', Shah narrated the misery of a woman (Heer), but a million of daughters of Punjab, Pritam feels, were crying to Shah.\n\nThe fields are lines up with dead bodies, and [[Chenab River|Chenab]] is filled with blood. Someone unknown poured poison in the water of the five rivers, and the deadly water is destroying the land. The land, which used to be fertile, is sprouting venom, and the sky has turned red from endless cries and tears.\n\n==Excerpt==\nThese are the opening lines of the poem:<ref>[http://apnaorg.com/poetry/amrita-r/ Amrita Pritam] Academy of the Punjab in North America (APNA).</ref><ref>[http://www.apnaorg.com/audio/amrita/ Ajj Aakhan Waris Shah Nu- Poetry in Amrita's Own Voice] Academy of the Punjab in North America (APNA).</ref>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"6\"\n!'''Punjabi - [[Gurmukhi]] script'''\n!'''Punjabi - [[Shahmukhi]] script'''\n!'''English translation'''\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|\n'''\u0a05\u0a71\u0a1c \u0a06\u0a16\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a35\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a38 \u0a38\u0a3c\u0a3e\u0a39 \u0a28\u0a42\u0a70 \u0a15\u0a3f\u0a24\u0a4b\u0a02 \u0a15\u0a2c\u0a30\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a35\u0a3f\u0a1a\u0a4b\u0a02 \u0a2c\u0a4b\u0a32\u0964'''<br>\n'''\u0a24\u0a47 \u0a05\u0a71\u0a1c \u0a15\u0a3f\u0a24\u0a3e\u0a2c\u0a47 \u0a07\u0a38\u0a3c\u0a15 \u0a26\u0a3e \u0a15\u0a4b\u0a08 \u0a05\u0a17\u0a32\u0a3e \u0a35\u0a30\u0a15\u0a3e \u0a2b\u0a4b\u0a32\u0964'''<br>\n'''\u0a07\u0a15 \u0a30\u0a4b\u0a08 \u0a38\u0a40 \u0a27\u0a40 \u0a2a\u0a70\u0a1c\u0a3e\u0a2c \u0a26\u0a40 \u0a24\u0a42\u0a70 \u0a32\u0a3f\u0a16 \u0a32\u0a3f\u0a16 \u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a47 \u0a35\u0a48\u0a23\u0964'''<br>\n'''\u0a05\u0a1c \u0a32\u0a71\u0a16\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a27\u0a40\u0a06\u0a02 \u0a30\u0a4b\u0a02\u0a26\u0a40\u0a06\u0a02 \u0a24\u0a48\u0a28\u0a42 \u0a35\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a38 \u0a38\u0a3c\u0a3e\u0a39 \u0a28\u0a42\u0a70 \u0a15\u0a39\u0a3f\u0a23\u0964'''<br>\n'''\u0a35\u0a47 \u0a26\u0a30\u0a26\u0a2e\u0a70\u0a26\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a26\u0a3f\u0a06 \u0a26\u0a30\u0a26\u0a40\u0a06 \u0a09\u0a71\u0a20 \u0a24\u0a71\u0a15 \u0a06\u0a2a\u0a23\u0a3e \u0a2a\u0a70\u0a1c\u0a3e\u0a2c\u0964'''<br>\n'''\u0a05\u0a1c \u0a2c\u0a47\u0a32\u0a47 \u0a32\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a3c\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a35\u0a3f\u0a1b\u0a40\u0a06\u0a02 \u0a24\u0a47 \u0a32\u0a39\u0a42 \u0a26\u0a40 \u0a2d\u0a30\u0a40 \u0a1a\u0a28\u0a3e\u0a2c\u0964'''<br>\n|\n{{nq|\u0627\u062c \u0622\u06a9\u06be\u0627\u06ba \u0648\u0627\u0631\u062b \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0646\u0648\u06ba\u060c \u06a9\u062a\u06be\u0648\u06ba \u0642\u0628\u0631\u0627\u06ba \u0648\u0686\u0648\u06ba \u0628\u0648\u0644<br>\n\u062a\u06d2 \u0627\u062c \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0650 \u0639\u0634\u0642 \u062f\u0627 \u06a9\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0627\u06af\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u0631\u0642\u06c1 \u067e\u064e\u06be\u0648\u0644<br>\n\u0627\u06a9 \u0631\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0633\u06cc \u062f\u06be\u06cc \u067e\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0628 \u062f\u06cc\u060c \u062a\u064f\u0648\u06ba \u0644\u06a9\u06be \u0644\u06a9\u06be \u0645\u0627\u0631\u06d2 \u0648\u06cc\u0646<br>\n\u0627\u062c \u0644\u06a9\u06be\u0627\u06ba \u062f\u06be\u06cc\u0627\u06ba \u0631\u0648\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u0627\u06ba\u060c \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0648\u06ba \u0648\u0627\u0631\u062b \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0646\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u06c1\u0646<br>\n\u0627\u064f\u0679\u06be \u062f\u0631\u062f \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0627\u06ba \u062f\u06cc\u0627 \u062f\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u0627\u060c \u0627\u064f\u0679\u06be \u0648\u06cc\u06a9\u06be \u0627\u067e\u0646\u0627 \u067e\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0628<br>\n\u0627\u062c \u0628\u06cc\u0644\u06d2 \u0644\u0627\u0634\u0627\u06ba \u0648\u0686\u06be\u06cc\u0627\u06ba \u062a\u06d2 \u0644\u06c1\u0648 \u062f\u06cc \u0628\u06be\u0631\u06cc \u0686\u0646\u0627\u0628}}\n|\nToday, I call Waris Shah, \u201cSpeak from your grave,\u201d<br>\nAnd turn to the next page in your book of love,<br>\nOnce, a daughter of Punjab cried and you wrote an entire saga,<br>\nToday, a million daughters cry out to you, Waris Shah,<br>\nRise!

{"title_page": "Crusade song", "text_new": "A '''Crusade song''' ({{lang-oc|canson de crozada}}, {{lang-ca|can\u00e7\u00f3 de croada}}, {{lang-de|Kreuzlied}}) is any [[vernacular]] [[lyric poem]] about the [[Crusades]]. Crusade songs were popular in the [[High Middle Ages]]: 106 survive in [[Occitan]], forty in [[Old French]], thirty in [[Middle High German]], two in [[Italian language|Italian]], and one in [[Old Spanish|Old Castilian]]. The study of the Crusade song, which may be considered a [[Literary genre|genre]] of its own, was pioneered by Kurt Lewent. He provided a classification of Crusade songs and distinguished between songs which merely mentioned, in some form, a Crusade from songs which were \"Crusade songs\".\n\nThe Crusade song was not confined to the topic of the [[Latin East]], but could concern the [[Reconquista]] in [[Spain]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in [[Languedoc]], or the political crusades in [[Italy]]. The first Crusade to be accompanied by songs, none of which survive, was the [[Crusade of 1101]], of which [[William IX of Aquitaine]] wrote, according to [[Orderic Vitalis]]. From the [[Second Crusade]] survive one French and ten Occitan songs. The [[Third Crusade|Third]] and [[Fourth Crusade]]s generated many songs in Occitan, French, and German. Occitan [[troubadours]] dealt especially with the Albigensian campaigns in the early thirteenth century, but their decline thereafter left the later Crusades&mdash;[[Fifth Crusade|Fifth]], [[Sixth Crusade|Sixth]], [[Seventh Crusade|Seventh]], and [[Eighth Crusade|Eighth]]&mdash;to be covered primarily by the German ''[[Minnesinger]]'' and French ''[[trouv\u00e8re]]s''.\n\n==List of Occitan crusading songs==\nThe following list is only of those songs defined as \"''Kreuzlied''\" in Lewent, \"Das altprovenzalische Kreuzlied\" (Berlin: 1905). Other songs may be considered \"crusading songs\", but there is no definitive list since Lewent. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Composer\n!Number<ref>The numbering system is that of Alfred Pillet and Henry Carstens in the ''Biographies des Troubadours'' (Halle: 1933).</ref>\n![[Incipit]] (i.e. title)\n!Date and context<ref>All dates come from Paterson (2003) and carry various degrees of certainty.</ref>\n|-\n|[[Aimeric de Belenoi]]\n|9.10\n|''Consiros com partitz d'amor''\n|Between [[Battle of Hattin]] and January 1188.\n|-\n|[[Aimeric de Peguillan]]\n|10.11\n|''Ara parra qual seran envejos''\n|1213, addressed to [[William VI of Montferrat]] to go to Syria. \n|-\n|[[Bertran de Born]]\n|80.30\n|''Nostre seigner somonis el meteis''\n|Early November/December 1187, or after January 1188, after [[Battle of Hattin]] when Bertran thought [[Philip I of France]] had made a crusading vow.\n|-\n|[[Bertran de Born]]\n|80.40\n|''S'eu fos aissi seigner e poderos''\n|\n|-\n|[[Elias Cairel]]\n|133.11\n|''Qui saubes dar tant bon conseil denan''\n|Before August 1219, forecasting an easy Crusader victory at Cairo. \n|-\n|[[Folquet de Marselha]]\n|155.7\n|''Chantars mi torn' ad afan''\n|November 1194 &ndash; 10 July 1195, probably during truce between [[Richard I of England]] and [[Philip I of France]], before [[Battle of Alarcos]] and the [[German Crusade]]. \n|-\n|[[Folquet de Marselha]]\n|155.15\n|''Oimais no.i conosc razo''\n|After 19 July 1195, date of the [[Battle of Alarcos]].

Crusade songs were popular in the [[High Middle Ages]]: 106 survive in [[Occitan]], forty in [[Old French]], thirty in [[Middle High German]], two in [[Italian language|Italian]], and one in [[Old Spanish|Old Castilian]]. The study of the Crusade song, which may be considered a [[Literary genre|genre]] of its own, was pioneered by Kurt Lewent. He provided a classification of Crusade songs and distinguished between songs which merely mentioned, in some form, a Crusade from songs which were \"Crusade songs\".\n\nThe Crusade song was not confined to the topic of the [[Latin East]], but could concern the [[Reconquista]] in [[Spain]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in [[Languedoc]], or the political crusades in [[Italy]]. The first Crusade to be accompanied by songs, none of which survive, was the [[Crusade of 1101]], of which [[William IX of Aquitaine]] wrote, according to [[Orderic Vitalis]]. From the [[Second Crusade]] survive one French and ten Occitan songs. The [[Third Crusade|Third]] and [[Fourth Crusade]]s generated many songs in Occitan, French, and German. Occitan [[troubadours]] dealt especially with the Albigensian campaigns in the early thirteenth century, but their decline thereafter left the later Crusades&mdash;[[Fifth Crusade|Fifth]], [[Sixth Crusade|Sixth]], [[Seventh Crusade|Seventh]], and [[Eighth Crusade|Eighth]]&mdash;to be covered primarily by the German ''[[Minnesinger]]'' and French ''[[trouv\u00e8re]]s''.\n\n==List of Occitan crusading songs==\nThe following list is only of those songs defined as \"''Kreuzlied''\" in Lewent, \"Das altprovenzalische Kreuzlied\" (Berlin: 1905).

The library is named after Albert and Shirley Small, who donated substantially to the construction of the library's current building.<ref>[http://www.readthehook.com/96513/cover-buried-treasure-uvas-special-collections-get-new-home \"Buried Treasure: UVA's Special Collections Get A New Home,\" in ''The Hook'' (March 3, 2005)]</ref> Albert Small, an alumnus of the University of Virginia, also donated his large personal collection of \"autograph documents and rare, early printings of the Declaration of Independence.\" This collection includes a rare printing of the [[Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence#Dunlap broadside|Dunlap broadside]] of the Declaration of Independence.

McGregor Library of American History, the Clifton Waller Barrett Library of American Literature, the [[William Faulkner]] collections, [[Jorge Luis Borges]] Collections, the Sadleir-Black Collection of [[Gothic Fiction]], extensive book, manuscript, and photography holdings in Virginia history, and original documents of the works, life, and legacy of [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Additional strengths include historical papers of [[James Madison]], [[Dolly Madison]] and [[James Monroe]], [[typography]] and other book arts, [[trade literature|trade catalogues]], [[slave narratives]], [[equestrianism]] and other forms of traditional [[sports]], documents, correspondence and oral records of the Southern [[Civil Rights Movement]], political and public affairs papers of major Virginia political figures, and one of the world's largest collections of [[miniature books]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Rufus Holsinger's image of The Rotunda burning in 1895, destroying most of the library collections.jpg|thumbnail|right|Rufus Holsinger's image of the Rotunda burning in 1895, destroying most of the library collections]]\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] situated a library, rather than a chapel, at the center of the University of Virginia's campus, unlike existing American colleges. He also composed the first list of books to be included in the collection and placed newspaper appeals for library gifts to fill the new library,<ref name=\"Plunkett\">Michael Plunkett,\"History of Special Collections,\" unpublished memoir of previous Director of Special Collections, 2008.</ref> which was housed in [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|The Rotunda]]. [[James Madison]], who was the second rector of the university after Jefferson, established the first endowment fund for acquisitions, through a bequest made in his will in 1836.<ref name=\"Special\">''Special Collections at the University of Virginia'' University of Virginia, 1995.</ref> After the Rotunda burned in 1895, only twenty percent of the original books survived; they are the longest held volumes in the Small Special Collections Library today, and librarians have for many years been acquiring replacements for burnt volumes. The University Archives and the earliest manuscript gift to the university\u2014the papers of [[Richard Henry Lee]], acquired before 1832<ref name=\"Special\" />\u2014also survived.\n\nIn the early decades of the twentieth century, many rare and unique items were added to the library's collections, both books and manuscripts. Purchases were also made as well, including the John Henry Ingram collection of Edgar Allan Poe. In 1930 a \"Virginia Collection\" was established in one wing of the library and the first archivist was hired.<ref name=\"Plunkett\" /> Following the construction of the new Alderman Library in 1938, the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts was organized to house and administer the principal historical materials in the library's collection. Over time, these units became separated, so that by 1962 there were two divisions: the Rare Books Division and the Manuscripts and University Archives Division. These departments merged in 1987 to form the Special Collections Department. In 2004, the current building opened.\n\n== Collections ==\n=== Foundational collections ===\nIn 1938, the library accepted as a donation the library of [[Tracy W. McGregor]], the Detroit philanthropist and book collector; McGregor had bequeathed his collection to the administrators of the McGregor Fund, who selected the University of Virginia as its final home. The fund also supported the construction of the McGregor Library, a large room in the new Alderman Library that housed the Rare Books reading room for several decades.  McGregor's collection of rare books, maps, and manuscripts comprised three areas of study: American exploration and history, British literature, and [[Cotton Mather]] and other members of the Mather family. The collection immediately established the University of Virginia as a center for the study of American history and culture.\n\nIn 1960, the library received a deposit that established it as a major site for the study of American Literature, when Clifton Waller Barrett placed in the library his major collection of books and manuscripts of major and minor American writers through 1940. The library has continued to collect in the tradition of Barrett since the collection arrived; Barrett's donation was finalized in the early 1990s. The Barrett book collection contains first and other significant editions of virtually every major work of American literature from the nation's founding to 1950, as well as many minor works, since Barrett's collecting interests stretched well beyond the canon. Of particular interest are deep holdings in little known writers, and an extensive collectionof editions and other printed materials related to Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]. Some of the significant manuscript materials held within the Barrett Collection include more than a hundred letters of the early American novelist [[Charles Brockden Brown]], manuscripts of several major works of [[Washington Irving]] and [[James Fenimore Cooper]], hundreds of manuscript fragments for the significantly enlarged second edition of Walt Whitman's [[Leaves of Grass]], a large collection of the papers of [[Louisa May Alcott]] and the Alcott family, significant manuscripts and correspondence of [[Mark Twain]], the papers of [[Stephen Crane]], including a manuscript of [[The Red Badge of Courage]], over 650 letters of [[Henry James]], significant holdings in the manuscripts, personal papers, and correspondence of [[Lafcadio Hearn]], [[Robert Frost]] (including a recently discovered unpublished poem<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092801882.html |title=Unknown Frost Poem Comes Out From Hiding at U.Va.|work=The Washington Post|date=29 September 2006|last=Kinzie|first=Susan}}</ref>), and [[Ernest Hemingway]], and the papers of novelists [[John Dos Passos]] and [[Ellen Glasgow]] and poets [[Vachel Lindsay]] and [[Sara Teasdale]].<ref>[http://small.library.virginia.edu/collections/featured/the-clifton-waller-barrett-library-of-american-literature/ The Clifton Waller Barrett Library of American Literature | Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=== Thomas Jefferson ===\n\nThe university has long been the home to many original documents relating to Thomas Jefferson and his family. Holdings include hundreds of letters to and from Jefferson, his architectural drawings, family documents, numerous books from Jefferson's library, an extensive research collection of works about Jefferson, and artifacts such as one of his [[polygraph (duplicating device)|polygraphs]] and the telescope with which Jefferson watched the construction of the university from his hilltop home nearby, [[Monticello]].\n\n=== University of Virginia archives and faculty papers ===\n\nThe library documents the history of the university all the way back to its founding; holdings include the original minute book of the Board of Visitors, written mostly in the hand of the first secretary, Thomas Jefferson, as well as the first matriculation book, which documents every student who entered the university in its early decades, including notables such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Early ledgers of the university document the building of the university's structures, the renting of enslaved laborers to build and maintain the campus, and the development of a curriculum. Documents from the late nineteenth- through the twentieth century document the development of the university's modern infrastructure, student organizations, expansion of the campus and operations, and debates over the university's refusal to admit women and black students.\n\nPapers of many of the university's most prominent faculty are held in Special Collections, including civil rights activist [[Julian Bond]], physicist [[Jesse Beams]], poet [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]], and novelists [[Ann Beattie]] and [[John Casey (novelist)|John Casey]].\n\n=== William Faulkner ===\nU.Va. holds the largest collection of printed and manuscript materials related to [[William Faulkner]]. His association with the library began when he came to the university as a visiting faculty member, first in the 1930s and then in the late 1950s. The [[William Faulkner Foundation]], which Faulkner founded, was created in part as a mechanism by which to secure the continued deposit of his papers in the university's Manuscripts Collection after his death, which occurred in 1962. This collection,  converted from a deposit to a gift in 1962, comprises the bulk of the manuscripts and typescripts of the writer's novels and short stories, along with extensive correspondence and other related materials. In 1960, scholar and bibliographer Linton Massey had donated his massive collection of Faulkner editions, periodicals, and secondary works. Faulkner's daughter, Jill, deposited many further manuscripts and over 300 books from Faulkner's library over the course of many years, and additional Faulkner collections, such as the papers of U.Va. professor and Faulkner biographer Joseph Blotner, have been added. The collection is the basis for a [http://faulkner.lib.virginia.edu/ major online archive of Faulkner audio recordings].\n\n=== Virginiana ===\nThe collections are an important source for research on the history of Virginia, with particular strength in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and Central Virginia. Collections of many significant Virginia families, plantations, and businesses are at the core of historical materials documenting Virginia from its earliest days to the present. Plantation and early family papers contain rare information about [[enslaved person]]<nowiki/>s, including a significant collection of letters written by previously enslaved Virginians who moved to Liberia. The collections are notable in their representation of regional debates over race, including the archives of influential eugenicists and civil rights activists. Also notable are the records of the Charlottesville School Board, which document the era of [[desegregation]] and [[massive resistance]]. Papers of Charlottesville and Albemarle County political figures are wide-ranging.\n\n=== Political cartoons and caricature ===\nThe collections are rich in the genre of political or editorial cartoons, and include the archives of Richmond editorial cartoonist [[Ed Seibel]], UVA alumnus [[Bob Gorrell]], and Art Wood. The Gerald Meeks Collection is a comprehensive collection of examples of American cartoon artists; among its treasures are a large collection of [[Oscar Cesare]] originals. The papers of [[Edward Stettinius Jr.]] include a large number of original editorial cartoons about the founding of the [[United Nations]]. A complete set of [[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)]] caricatures also resides in the library. In 2018 the library acquired the papers and original art of editorial cartoonist and fine artist [[Pat Oliphant]].\n\n=== Gordon Collection ===\n\n{{Main|Gordon Collection}}\n\nThe Gordon Collection (also known as the Douglas H. Gordon Collection) comprises some 1200 volumes of French books dating from the sixteenth through the 19th century.<ref name=\"Tarte\">{{Cite book| publisher = Brill| isbn = 978-90-04-35151-6| pages = 52\u201374| last = Tarte| first = Kendall| title = Itineraries in French Renaissance Literature: Essays for Mary B.
