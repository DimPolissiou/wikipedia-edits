The team plays in the [[International League]] and is the top minor league affiliate of the [[Minnesota Twins]]. The Red Wings play their home games at [[Frontier Field]], located in downtown Rochester. Founded in 1899, it is the oldest continuously operating sports franchise in North America below the major league level.\n\nSince the widespread adoption of the minor league [[farm system]] in the 1920s, the Red Wings have been affiliated with only three [[Major League Baseball]] clubs, an unusually stable, 90-year history.<ref>[https://pickinsplinters.com/2018/05/15/would-wings-consider-affiliation-change-twins-gm-hopes-not/ Oklobziga, Kevin, \"Would Wings Consider an Affiliation Change? Twins' GM Hopes Not,\" Pickin' Splinters.com, 15 May 2018]</ref> They were a top farm team of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] for 32 years (1929\u20131960), then spent 42 years (1961\u20132002) as the top affiliate of the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. They then became the Triple-A affiliate of the Twins (2003\u2013present).\n\nThe franchise played from 1929 through 1996 at [[Silver Stadium]] (called Red Wing Stadium from 1929\u20131968) and moved to [[Frontier Field]] in 1997.\n\nThe Red Wings, along with the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]], hold the record for the [[longest professional baseball game]], lasting a total of 33 innings and 8 hours, 25 minutes over the course of three different days. The game was held at Pawtucket's [[McCoy Stadium]], beginning on April 18, 1981. It was suspended just after 4 a.m. the next morning, and Rochester lost, 3\u20132, when the game resumed on June 23.\n\n==Baseball in Rochester==\nBaseball in Rochester dates back to 1877 with the \"Rochesters\" of the [[International Association for Professional Base Ball Players|International Association]], and Rochester has had a franchise in the league now known as the International League as early as 1885.\n\nAccording to Rochester sports historian [[Douglas Brei]], only six franchises in the history of North American professional sports have been playing in the same city and same league continuously and uninterrupted since the 19th century: the Rochester Red Wings, [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. He also reports that the Red Wings and the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] are the only two franchises in North American professional sports to have captured a league championship{{efn|The IL Regular Season Pennant symbolized the League Champion until the Governors' Cup was established in 1933. Since 1933, the IL has officially recognized both the Pennant Winner and the Governors' Cup as League Champions. The Red Wings captured Governors' Cups in every decade since it was established except the 1940s, a decade in which they won the IL Pennant in 1940. Since the IL was separated into divisions in 1988, most people have come to consider the Governors' Cup winner to be the league champion, although in the early years most still considered the Pennant Winner to be the true league champion. The league still officially recognizes both titlists as champions.}} in every decade of the 20th century.<ref>The Rochester Sports Project, by [[Douglas Brei]]</ref><ref>2005 CFL Facts, Figures, and Records Guide</ref><ref>2006 International League Guide and Record Book</ref>\n\n==Franchise history==\n[[File:RochesterRedWingsVsBuffaloBisonsAugust2017Game.jpg|thumb|Red Wings at bat against the [[Buffalo Bisons]] in August 2017]]\n\n===Early history (1899\u20131928)===\nThe current franchise has been playing in Rochester since 1899, when the team was known as the Rochester Bronchos and won the [[International League|Eastern League]] championship in its inaugural season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Rochester_Bronchos |title=Rochester Bronchos |publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |accessdate=November 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Cardinals era (1929\u20131960)===\nThe Red Wings became the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in {{baseball year|1929}}. Aside from the affiliation, the Cardinals also owned the Wings and their stadium, then known as [[Red Wing Stadium]]. The early years of the Cardinals and Red Wings saw the Red Wings very much a power house, not unlike their parent club. The team was managed by [[Billy Southworth]] (who split time managing the team in 1929 with [[Bill McKechnie]]), and from 1929\u20131931, the team won the International League championship. In a true statement of how dominant a team they were, they won 103 games in 1929, 105 games in 1930, and 101 games in 1931.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\">https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Rochester_Red_Wings</ref> The team would remain competitive for many years, with 1935 and 1937 being the only years that they lost more games than they won. The return of Billy Southworth in 1939 brought another league championship to Rochester.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/>\n\nLean times were ahead for Rochester, with the 1940s finding the Red Wings on the bottom half of the standings. Even former famed pitcher [[Burleigh Grimes]] couldn't change the team's fortunes. He lasted a little more than a season and a half when he was replaced by Benny Borgmann.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> The team would capture three more league championships in the Cardinals era, those coming in 1952, 1955, and 1956.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> In the fall of {{baseball year|1956}}, the Cardinals ceased to operate the Red Wings and put both the team and the stadium up for sale. In response, [[Morrie Silver]], a Rochester businessman, formed [[Rochester Community Baseball, Inc.]] (RCB) and spearheaded a drive to sell shares in RCB to raise money to buy the Red Wings and Red Wing Stadium to ensure that the franchise would remain in Rochester. The attempt was successful as RCB purchased both entities from the Cardinals on February 27, 1957, in an event that was dubbed the \"72 Day Miracle\". RCB, composed of fans of the team as shareholders, continues to own and operate the club to this day, making the Red Wings one of two current American professional sports franchises that are publicly owned. The [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]] are the most notable example of this distinction.\n\nIn 1959, the Red Wings were involved in one of minor league baseball's most infamous games. While playing in [[Havana, Cuba]], the Red Wings' July 25 game against the [[Havana Sugar Kings]] was interrupted at midnight by gunfire and fireworks in celebration of the [[26th of July Movement]].<ref name=\"Remembering Cuban baseball\u2019s Sugar Kings\">{{cite news|last=Straus|first=Ben|title=Remembering Cuban baseball\u2019s Sugar Kings|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/baseball/remembering-cuban-baseballs-sugar-kings/article10259455/|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 March 2013}}</ref> Rochester's [[Frank Verdi]], standing in as third-base coach in place of manager [[Cot Deal]], who had been ejected earlier in the game, was grazed by a bullet, as was [[Leo C\u00e1rdenas]], the Sugar Kings' shortstop.<ref name=\"Remembering Cuban baseball\u2019s Sugar Kings\" /> Neither player was seriously injured, but both the game and then the series were canceled.<ref name=\"Remembering Cuban baseball\u2019s Sugar Kings\" />\n\nThe Wings remained St. Louis' affiliate until {{baseball year|1960}}, when the Red Wings moved on to become the top farm club of the [[Baltimore Orioles]].\n\n===Orioles era (1961\u20132002)===\nAfter two straight fourth-place finishes, and early exits from the playoffs, the Red Wings dismissed [[Clyde King]], a hold over from the Cardinals era, as manager of the team, and named [[Darrell Johnson]] in his place. Johnson never managed a finish better than fourth during his tenure, however, in 1964, with an 82-72 record, Johnson's Red Wings managed to win yet another championship.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> He was replaced by Earl Weaver, who showed great promise as a manager. After two seasons, Weaver was brought up to manage the Baltimore Orioles, and he was replaced by [[Billy DeMars]], who lasted one season before being replaced by [[Cal Ripken, Sr.]] After two seasons, Ripken was replaced by [[Joe Altobelli]]. Red Wing Stadium was renamed [[Silver Stadium]] in honor of Morrie Silver on August 19, 1968. From 1971-1976, the Red Wings never missed the playoffs, capturing two more league titles in the process in 1971 and 1974.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> Altobelli returned to the Red Wings after his retirement from the coaching ranks, serving as general manager from late 1991 to 1994 and then as part of the radio broadcasting team through 2008.\n\n1978 was a terrible season for the Red Wings, as the club had three managers, [[Ken Boyer]], [[Al Widmar]], and [[Frank Robinson]]. The team finished 68-72. Robinson was replaced by [[Doc Edwards]], who managed to get the team to the playoffs in 1980, but could not manage a league title. Edwards was soon gone, replaced by Lance Nicholls, who in turn, was replaced by former Tidewater Tides manager [[Frank Verdi]].<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> The team did horribly under Verdi, and was mainly stocked with cast off former major leaguers, career minor league players, and very few prospects. The only bona fide major league prospect on the team during this lean period was Larry Sheets, who was mainly a journeyman hitter during his career.\n\nVerdi was fired midway through 1985, with the Red Wings at 18-40. Under his replacement, first base coach [[Mark Wiley]], the Red Wings went 40-41 the rest of the season.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/>\n\n[[File:Rochester Red Wings 1980s logo.gif|right]]\nThere would be a return to glory, when the Red Wings named [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] as the new manager. He was able to guide the team into the playoffs during his two-year stint, but none resulted in a championship. However, Hart impressed the Orioles, and he was soon off to the majors. His replacement was former New York Yankees catcher [[Johnny Oates]]. Oates won the league title in his first year and only year at the helm. His replacement was [[Greg Biagini]]. In 1990, Biagini led a loaded Red Wings team, which featured future Red Sox hero [[Curt Schilling]], to the league championship.\n\nIn 1993, the Red Wings, guided by manager Bob Miscik, reached the International League finals but lost to the [[Charlotte Knights]] in five games.\n\nIn 1997, the Red Wings moved into the new [[Frontier Field]] in downtown Rochester after 68 seasons at [[Silver Stadium]] on the city's northeast side. That same year, manager [[Marv Foley]] led the Wings to a league title.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/>\n\nIn 2000, during the team's fourth year at the stadium, the Red Wings played host to the [[Triple-A All-Star Game]].\n\nRochester won six [[Governors' Cup]] titles during their 42-year affiliation with the Orioles, with the last coming in {{baseball year|1997}}. The team's fortunes began to decline by {{baseball year|1999}}, though, as the product on the field slipped in quality. By {{baseball year|2002}}, the fifth consecutive losing season for Rochester and what would be the last year of the player development agreement between Baltimore and Rochester, the team's record slipped to a league-worst 55\u201389. The Red Wings' affiliation with the Orioles ended when it signed a working agreement with the [[Minnesota Twins]] on September 17, 2002.<ref>[http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20020917&content_id=130627&vkey=pr_min&fext=.jsp&c_id=min \"Twins Sign Two-Year Agreement With Rochester Red Wings,\" Minnesota Twins press release, Tuesday, September 17, 2002.]</ref>\n\n===Twins era (2003\u2013present)===\n\nThe Red Wings' first season as the Twins' Triple-A affiliate was the team's sixth consecutive losing season. Beginning in {{baseball year|2004}}, however, the team began to turn their fortunes around. In both 2004 and {{baseball year|2005}}, the Red Wings finished in second place in the North Division with records of 73\u201371 and 75\u201369, respectively. The turnaround was capped in {{baseball year|2006}} when Rochester, now under the leadership of [[Stan Cliburn]], advanced to the International League playoffs as the Wild Card with a record of 79\u201364. The Red Wings then beat the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons]] three games to one in the best-of-five semifinal series but lost to the [[Toledo Mud Hens]] in five games, three games to two, in the best-of-five Governors' Cup series.\n\nRochester followed up their run to the 2006 Governors' Cup Finals by posting a winning record in each of the next two seasons, bringing the streak of consecutive winning seasons to five. In {{baseball year|2008}}, the team went 74\u201370 after being as far as 13 games under .500 at one point (19\u201332 on May 25). The streak was snapped in {{baseball year|2009}} after the team finished 70\u201374. On September&nbsp;21, 2009, the Minnesota Twins announced that they would not renew manager Stan Cliburn's contract for the 2010 season. According to Twins farm director [[Jim Rantz]], the change was made as part of an \"overall directional change that is being implemented throughout the minor-league system.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20090921/SPORTS06/90921024/1024/Cliburn+won+t+return+as+Red+Wings+manager |first=Jim |last=Mandelaro |title=Cliburn won't return as Red Wings manager |date=September 21, 2009 |accessdate=September 22, 2009 |work=Democrat and Chronicle}}</ref>  Former [[New Britain Rock Cats]] manager [[Tom Nieto]] was Cliburn's replacement.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20091021/SPORTS06/910210351/Nieto+takes+Rochester+Red+Wings++helm |first=Jim |last=Mandelaro |title=Nieto takes Rochester Red Wings' helm |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=October 21, 2009 |work=Democrat and Chronicle}}</ref> Nieto was fired at the close of the 2011 season after leading the Red Wings to their first back-to-back 90-loss seasons since 1903\u201304.<ref>http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/blogs/129545593.html</ref>\n\nOn November 25, 2011 [[Gene Glynn]] was announced as the new Red Wings manager for 2012.<ref>http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20111125/SPORTS06/111125019/Red-Wings-name-Gene-Glynn-manager?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CHome</ref>  The 2012 season saw the Red Wings scratch out a .500 record, considered a vast improvement over the Nieto years.  With Glynn continuing as manager, the 2013 Wings got off to a dismal 2\u201311 start, but slowly improved before turning red-hot in July.  At some points they led the North Division, but a late surge by Pawtucket relegated the Wings to a fight for the IL's lone wild card spot.  They secured the wild card on the last day of the season, based on a tiebreaker with the [[Norfolk Tides]], leading the Wings to their first postseason appearance since 2006. The following season's playoff push came down to the final series of the year in [[Pawtucket Red Sox|Pawtucket]], but a loss on August 31 put them out of the picture for good.<ref>http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/sports/baseball/minors/2014/09/01/rochester-red-wings-special-team/14946255/</ref>\n\nAfter the 2014 season, [[Gene Glynn]] was promoted to become the third base coach for the major league [[Minnesota Twins]].<ref>http://www.twincities.com/twins/ci_26925074/twins-hire-gene-glynn-rudy-hernandez-coaching-staff</ref> \n\nTo replace Glynn, the Red Wings announced on January 30, 2015, that former [[Chicago Cubs]]' manager [[Mike Quade]] would be taking over for the 2015 season, a position he retained for three years through the 2017 campaign.<ref>http://www.rochesterhomepage.net/story/d/story/red-wings-introduce-mike-quade-as-manager/25489/Hkm3clkXj0m4lvL_ii7HQw</ref>\n\nOn January 17, 2018 former MLB catcher, coach and manager [[Joel Skinner]] was named as the 45th manager of the team.\n\n==Titles==\nThe Red Wings have played for the [[Governors' Cup]], the championship of the International League, 21 times, winning 10.\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*1933&nbsp;\u2013 Lost to [[Buffalo Bisons|Buffalo]]\n*1934&nbsp;\u2013 Lost to [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto]]\n*1939&nbsp;\u2013 Defeated [[Newark Bears|Newark]]\n*1950&nbsp;\u2013 Lost to [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore]]\n*1952&nbsp;\u2013 Defeated [[Montreal Royals|Montr\u00e9al]]\n*1953&nbsp;\u2013 Lost to [[Montreal Royals|Montr\u00e9al]]\n*1955&nbsp;\u2013 Defeated [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto]]\n*1956&nbsp;\u2013 Defeated [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto]]\n*1960&nbsp;\u2013 Lost to [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto]]\n*1961&nbsp;\u2013 Lost to [[Buffalo Bisons|Buffalo]]\n*1964&nbsp;\u2013 Defeated [[Syracuse SkyChiefs|Syracuse]]\n*1971&nbsp;\u2013 Defeated [[Norfolk Tides|Tidewater]]\n*1974&nbsp;\u2013 Defeated [[Syracuse SkyChiefs|Syracuse]]\n*1982&nbsp;\u2013 Lost to [[Norfolk Tides|Tidewater]]\n*1986&nbsp;\u2013 Lost to [[Richmond Braves|Richmond]]\n*1988&nbsp;\u2013 Defeated [[Norfolk Tides|Tidewater]]\n*1990&nbsp;\u2013 Defeated [[Columbus Clippers|Columbus]]\n*1993&nbsp;\u2013 Lost to [[Charlotte Knights|Charlotte]]\n*1996&nbsp;\u2013 Lost to [[Columbus Clippers|Columbus]]\n*1997&nbsp;\u2013 Defeated [[Columbus Clippers|Columbus]]\n*2006&nbsp;\u2013 Lost to [[Toledo Mud Hens|Toledo]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Year-by-year records==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e0e0e0;\"\n!

The team plays in the [[International League]] and is the top minor league affiliate of the [[Minnesota Twins]]. The Red Wings play their home games at [[Frontier Field]], located in downtown Rochester. Founded in 1899, it is the oldest continuously operating sports franchise in North America below the major league level.\n\nSince the widespread adoption of the minor league [[farm system]] in the 1920s, the Red Wings have been affiliated with only three [[Major League Baseball]] clubs, an unusually stable, 90-year history.<ref>[https://pickinsplinters.com/2018/05/15/would-wings-consider-affiliation-change-twins-gm-hopes-not/ Oklobziga, Kevin, \"Would Wings Consider an Affiliation Change? Twins' GM Hopes Not,\" Pickin' Splinters.com, 15 May 2018]</ref> They were a top farm team of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] for 32 years (1929\u20131960), then spent 42 years (1961\u20132002) as the top affiliate of the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. They then became the Triple-A affiliate of the Twins (2003\u2013present).\n\nThe franchise played from 1929 through 1996 at [[Silver Stadium]] (called Red Wing Stadium from 1929\u20131968) and moved to [[Frontier Field]] in 1997.\n\nThe Red Wings, along with the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]], hold the record for the [[longest professional baseball game]], lasting a total of 33 innings and 8 hours, 25 minutes over the course of three different days. The game was held at Pawtucket's [[McCoy Stadium]], beginning on April 18, 1981. It was suspended just after 4 a.m. the next morning, and Rochester lost, 3\u20132, when the game resumed on June 23.\n\n==Baseball in Rochester==\nBaseball in Rochester dates back to 1877 with the \"Rochesters\" of the [[International Association for Professional Base Ball Players|International Association]], and Rochester has had a franchise in the league now known as the International League as early as 1885.\n\nAccording to Rochester sports historian [[Douglas Brei]], only six franchises in the history of North American professional sports have been playing in the same city and same league continuously and uninterrupted since the 19th century: the Rochester Red Wings, [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. He also reports that the Red Wings and the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] are the only two franchises in North American professional sports to have captured a league championship{{efn|The IL Regular Season Pennant symbolized the League Champion until the Governors' Cup was established in 1933. Since 1933, the IL has officially recognized both the Pennant Winner and the Governors' Cup as League Champions. The Red Wings captured Governors' Cups in every decade since it was established except the 1940s, a decade in which they won the IL Pennant in 1940. Since the IL was separated into divisions in 1988, most people have come to consider the Governors' Cup winner to be the league champion, although in the early years most still considered the Pennant Winner to be the true league champion. The league still officially recognizes both titlists as champions.}} in every decade of the 20th century.<ref>The Rochester Sports Project, by [[Douglas Brei]]</ref><ref>2005 CFL Facts, Figures, and Records Guide</ref><ref>2006 International League Guide and Record Book</ref>\n\n==Franchise history==\n[[File:RochesterRedWingsVsBuffaloBisonsAugust2017Game.jpg|thumb|Red Wings at bat against the [[Buffalo Bisons]] in August 2017]]\n\n===Early history (1899\u20131928)===\nThe current franchise has been playing in Rochester since 1899, when the team was known as the Rochester Bronchos and won the [[International League|Eastern League]] championship in its inaugural season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Rochester_Bronchos |title=Rochester Bronchos |publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |accessdate=November 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Cardinals era (1929\u20131960)===\nThe Red Wings became the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in {{baseball year|1929}}. Aside from the affiliation, the Cardinals also owned the Wings and their stadium, then known as [[Red Wing Stadium]]. The early years of the Cardinals and Red Wings saw the Red Wings very much a power house, not unlike their parent club. The team was managed by [[Billy Southworth]] (who split time managing the team in 1929 with [[Bill McKechnie]]), and from 1929\u20131931, the team won the International League championship. In a true statement of how dominant a team they were, they won 103 games in 1929, 105 games in 1930, and 101 games in 1931.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\">https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Rochester_Red_Wings</ref> The team would remain competitive for many years, with 1935 and 1937 being the only years that they lost more games than they won. The return of Billy Southworth in 1939 brought another league championship to Rochester.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/>\n\nLean times were ahead for Rochester, with the 1940s finding the Red Wings on the bottom half of the standings. Even former famed pitcher [[Burleigh Grimes]] couldn't change the team's fortunes. He lasted a little more than a season and a half when he was replaced by Benny Borgmann.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> The team would capture three more league championships in the Cardinals era, those coming in 1952, 1955, and 1956.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> In the fall of {{baseball year|1956}}, the Cardinals ceased to operate the Red Wings and put both the team and the stadium up for sale. In response, [[Morrie Silver]], a Rochester businessman, formed [[Rochester Community Baseball, Inc.]] (RCB) and spearheaded a drive to sell shares in RCB to raise money to buy the Red Wings and Red Wing Stadium to ensure that the franchise would remain in Rochester. The attempt was successful as RCB purchased both entities from the Cardinals on February 27, 1957, in an event that was dubbed the \"72 Day Miracle\". RCB, composed of fans of the team as shareholders, continues to own and operate the club to this day, making the Red Wings one of two current American professional sports franchises that are publicly owned. The [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]] are the most notable example of this distinction.\n\nIn 1959, the Red Wings were involved in one of minor league baseball's most infamous games. While playing in [[Havana, Cuba]], the Red Wings' July 25 game against the [[Havana Sugar Kings]] was interrupted at midnight by gunfire and fireworks in celebration of the [[26th of July Movement]].<ref name=\"Remembering Cuban baseball\u2019s Sugar Kings\">{{cite news|last=Straus|first=Ben|title=Remembering Cuban baseball\u2019s Sugar Kings|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/baseball/remembering-cuban-baseballs-sugar-kings/article10259455/|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 March 2013}}</ref> Rochester's [[Frank Verdi]], standing in as third-base coach in place of manager [[Cot Deal]], who had been ejected earlier in the game, was grazed by a bullet, as was [[Leo C\u00e1rdenas]], the Sugar Kings' shortstop.<ref name=\"Remembering Cuban baseball\u2019s Sugar Kings\" /> Neither player was seriously injured, but both the game and then the series were canceled.<ref name=\"Remembering Cuban baseball\u2019s Sugar Kings\" />\n\nThe Wings remained St. Louis' affiliate until {{baseball year|1960}}, when the Red Wings moved on to become the top farm club of the [[Baltimore Orioles]].\n\n===Orioles era (1961\u20132002)===\nAfter two straight fourth-place finishes, and early exits from the playoffs, the Red Wings dismissed [[Clyde King]], a hold over from the Cardinals era, as manager of the team, and named [[Darrell Johnson]] in his place. Johnson never managed a finish better than fourth during his tenure, however, in 1964, with an 82-72 record, Johnson's Red Wings managed to win yet another championship.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> He was replaced by Earl Weaver, who showed great promise as a manager. After two seasons, Weaver was brought up to manage the Baltimore Orioles, and he was replaced by [[Billy DeMars]], who lasted one season before being replaced by [[Cal Ripken, Sr.]] After two seasons, Ripken was replaced by [[Joe Altobelli]]. Red Wing Stadium was renamed [[Silver Stadium]] in honor of Morrie Silver on August 19, 1968. From 1971-1976, the Red Wings never missed the playoffs, capturing two more league titles in the process in 1971 and 1974.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> Altobelli returned to the Red Wings after his retirement from the coaching ranks, serving as general manager from late 1991 to 1994 and then as part of the radio broadcasting team through 2008.\n\n1978 was a terrible season for the Red Wings, as the club had three managers, [[Ken Boyer]], [[Al Widmar]], and [[Frank Robinson]]. The team finished 68-72. Robinson was replaced by [[Doc Edwards]], who managed to get the team to the playoffs in 1980, but could not manage a league title. Edwards was soon gone, replaced by Lance Nicholls, who in turn, was replaced by former Tidewater Tides manager [[Frank Verdi]].<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> The team did horribly under Verdi, and was mainly stocked with cast off former major leaguers, career minor league players, and very few prospects. The only bona fide major league prospect on the team during this lean period was Larry Sheets, who was mainly a journeyman hitter during his career.\n\nVerdi was fired midway through 1985, with the Red Wings at 18-40. Under his replacement, first base coach [[Mark Wiley]], the Red Wings went 40-41 the rest of the season.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/>\n\n[[File:Rochester Red Wings 1980s logo.gif|right]]\nThere would be a return to glory, when the Red Wings named [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] as the new manager. He was able to guide the team into the playoffs during his two-year stint, but none resulted in a championship. However, Hart impressed the Orioles, and he was soon off to the majors. His replacement was former New York Yankees catcher [[Johnny Oates]]. Oates won the league title in his first year and only year at the helm. His replacement was [[Greg Biagini]]. In 1990, Biagini led a loaded Red Wings team, which featured future Red Sox hero [[Curt Schilling]], to the league championship.\n\nIn 1993, the Red Wings, guided by manager Bob Miscik, reached the International League finals but lost to the [[Charlotte Knights]] in five games.\n\nIn 1997, the Red Wings moved into the new [[Frontier Field]] in downtown Rochester after 68 seasons at [[Silver Stadium]] on the city's northeast side. That same year, manager [[Marv Foley]] led the Wings to a league title.<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/>\n\nIn 2000, during the team's fourth year at the stadium, the Red Wings played host to the [[Triple-A All-Star Game]].\n\nRochester won six [[Governors' Cup]] titles during their 42-year affiliation with the Orioles, with the last coming in {{baseball year|1997}}. The team's fortunes began to decline by {{baseball year|1999}}, though, as the product on the field slipped in quality. By {{baseball year|2002}}, the fifth consecutive losing season for Rochester and what would be the last year of the player development agreement between Baltimore and Rochester, the team's record slipped to a league-worst 55\u201389. The Red Wings' affiliation with the Orioles ended when it signed a working agreement with the [[Minnesota Twins]] on September 17, 2002.<ref>[http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20020917&content_id=130627&vkey=pr_min&fext=.jsp&c_id=min \"Twins Sign Two-Year Agreement With Rochester Red Wings,\" Minnesota Twins press release, Tuesday, September 17, 2002.]</ref>\n\n===Twins era (2003\u2013present)===\n\nThe Red Wings' first season as the Twins' Triple-A affiliate was the team's sixth consecutive losing season. Beginning in {{baseball year|2004}}, however, the team began to turn their fortunes around. In both 2004 and {{baseball year|2005}}, the Red Wings finished in second place in the North Division with records of 73\u201371 and 75\u201369, respectively. The turnaround was capped in {{baseball year|2006}} when Rochester, now under the leadership of [[Stan Cliburn]], advanced to the International League playoffs as the Wild Card with a record of 79\u201364. The Red Wings then beat the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons]] three games to one in the best-of-five semifinal series but lost to the [[Toledo Mud Hens]] in five games, three games to two, in the best-of-five Governors' Cup series.\n\nRochester followed up their run to the 2006 Governors' Cup Finals by posting a winning record in each of the next two seasons, bringing the streak of consecutive winning seasons to five. In {{baseball year|2008}}, the team went 74\u201370 after being as far as 13 games under .500 at one point (19\u201332 on May 25). The streak was snapped in {{baseball year|2009}} after the team finished 70\u201374. On September&nbsp;21, 2009, the Minnesota Twins announced that they would not renew manager Stan Cliburn's contract for the 2010 season. According to Twins farm director [[Jim Rantz]], the change was made as part of an \"overall directional change that is being implemented throughout the minor-league system.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20090921/SPORTS06/90921024/1024/Cliburn+won+t+return+as+Red+Wings+manager |first=Jim |last=Mandelaro |title=Cliburn won't return as Red Wings manager |date=September 21, 2009 |accessdate=September 22, 2009 |work=Democrat and Chronicle}}</ref>  Former [[New Britain Rock Cats]] manager [[Tom Nieto]] was Cliburn's replacement.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20091021/SPORTS06/910210351/Nieto+takes+Rochester+Red+Wings++helm |first=Jim |last=Mandelaro |title=Nieto takes Rochester Red Wings' helm |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=October 21, 2009 |work=Democrat and Chronicle}}</ref> Nieto was fired at the close of the 2011 season after leading the Red Wings to their first back-to-back 90-loss seasons since 1903\u201304.<ref>http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/blogs/129545593.html</ref>\n\nOn November 25, 2011 [[Gene Glynn]] was announced as the new Red Wings manager for 2012.<ref>http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20111125/SPORTS06/111125019/Red-Wings-name-Gene-Glynn-manager?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CHome</ref>  The 2012 season saw the Red Wings scratch out a .500 record, considered a vast improvement over the Nieto years.  With Glynn continuing as manager, the 2013 Wings got off to a dismal 2\u201311 start, but slowly improved before turning red-hot in July.  At some points they led the North Division, but a late surge by Pawtucket relegated the Wings to a fight for the IL's lone wild card spot.

A descendant of [[Danish people|Danes]], he was taken sailing by his grandfather at the age of five years on the [[sailboat]] ''Aileen'', of the 6 meter class, which was the boat used by the silver medal winning [[1912 Summer Olympics]] Danish sailing team. Once he moved to [[Niter\u00f3i]], he started sailing with his brother, [[Lars Grael]], also an Olympic medal winner, on the [[Bay of Guanabara]]. He is father of olympic champion [[Martine Grael]].\n\n==Record==\nNicknamed [[Turbine]] for his fame in conducting sailboats, he collected five Olympic medals, four of them in the Star class.\n\nHe is the Brazilian with the highest number of Olympic medals, and holds the highest number of Olympic medals in sailing together with [[Ben Ainslie]] and [[Robert Scheidt]] with five, followed by [[Paul Bert Elvstr\u00f8m|Paul Elvstr\u00f8m]] with four. He also placed first place in many World, South American and Brazilian championships in several categories. His first-mate is usually [[Marcelo Ferreira]].\n\nGrael has also sailed in other international competitions including the [[2005\u201306 Volvo Ocean Race]] as skipper of the ''Brasil 1'' team, the first 100% Brazilian outfit to enter the competition, which finished third overall. He would win the next [[2008\u201309 Volvo Ocean Race|Ocean Race]], but this time as the skipper of the Swedish team ''Ericsson 4'' (he won the race with two legs to spare). In October 2008 the yacht Ericsson 4 officially travelled 596.6 nautical miles in 24 hours, establishing a 24-hour monohull record. Skipper Torben Grael and his crew made the record on the first leg of the 2008\u20132009 Volvo Ocean Race. They sailed Ericsson 4 hard as a strong cold front hit the fleet, bringing winds approaching 40 knots, and propelling the yacht at an average speed of 24.8 knots.\n\nHe has sailed in several [[America's Cup]] races, including the winning campaign in Louis Vuitton Cup in 2000 and the 2007 event as tactician aboard [[Luna Rossa Challenge]]<ref>http://torben-grael.com/results.php</ref>\n\n==Results \u2013 Dinghy Sailing ==\n\n===International===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

(born July 22, 1960) is one of the most well known [[Brazil]]ian [[sailor]]s, renowned in international competitions. A descendant of [[Danish people|Danes]], he was taken sailing by his grandfather at the age of five years on the [[sailboat]] ''Aileen'', of the 6 meter class, which was the boat used by the silver medal winning [[1912 Summer Olympics]] Danish sailing team. Once he moved to [[Niter\u00f3i]], he started sailing with his brother, [[Lars Grael]], also an Olympic medal winner, on the [[Bay of Guanabara]]. He is father of olympic champion [[Martine Grael]].\n\n==Record==\nNicknamed [[Turbine]] for his fame in conducting sailboats, he collected five Olympic medals, four of them in the Star class.\n\nHe is the Brazilian with the highest number of Olympic medals, and holds the highest number of Olympic medals in sailing together with [[Ben Ainslie]] and [[Robert Scheidt]] with five, followed by [[Paul Bert Elvstr\u00f8m|Paul Elvstr\u00f8m]] with four. He also placed first place in many World, South American and Brazilian championships in several categories. His first-mate is usually [[Marcelo Ferreira]].\n\nGrael has also sailed in other international competitions including the [[2005\u201306 Volvo Ocean Race]] as skipper of the ''Brasil 1'' team, the first 100% Brazilian outfit to enter the competition, which finished third overall. He would win the next [[2008\u201309 Volvo Ocean Race|Ocean Race]], but this time as the skipper of the Swedish team ''Ericsson 4'' (he won the race with two legs to spare). In October 2008 the yacht Ericsson 4 officially travelled 596.6 nautical miles in 24 hours, establishing a 24-hour monohull record. Skipper Torben Grael and his crew made the record on the first leg of the 2008\u20132009 Volvo Ocean Race. They sailed Ericsson 4 hard as a strong cold front hit the fleet, bringing winds approaching 40 knots, and propelling the yacht at an average speed of 24.8 knots.\n\nHe has sailed in several [[America's Cup]] races, including the winning campaign in Louis Vuitton Cup in 2000 and the 2007 event as tactician aboard [[Luna Rossa Challenge]]<ref>http://torben-grael.com/results.php</ref>\n\n==Results \u2013 Dinghy Sailing ==\n\n===International===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

They participated in 132 Grands Prix between 1980 and 1990. They achieved two points finishes and scored 5 championship points.\n\n==Early days==\n[[File:Osella PA5 BMW.jpg|thumb|Osella placed second in the [[1977 World Championship for Sports Cars]] with the Osella PA5 BMW.]]\nNamed after its founder Vincenzo \"Enzo\" Osella, the team began life by racing [[Abarth]] [[sports car racing|sports car]]s in local and national races in Italy in the mid-1960s. Though relatively successful (Osella eventually took over the factory Abarth sports car program), Osella expanded into single-seater racing in 1974 to further develop his business. In 1975, the team entered the [[1975 European Formula Two Championship|European Formula Two Championship]] for the first time, achieving some success with its own car, the [[BMW in motorsport|BMW]]-powered Osella FA2.\n\nOsella continued in Formula Two in [[1976 European Formula Two Championship|1976]], but financial problems meant that the team was not competitive and withdrew from the championship before the end of the season. In the following years, the FA2s were occasionally entered by privateers, one of them being the Swiss Charly Kiser.\n\n==The late 1970s==\nEnzo Osella tried to make some money by selling a self-penned [[Formula Three]] car, the Osella FA3, with little success. Only a few privateers were optimistic enough to buy the simple, untested machine, which with [[Toyota]] or [[Lancia]] engines competed in the 1976 [[Germany|German]] and Italian F3 championships without making any great impression. After this, the team concentrated on running in local sports car events during 1977 and 1978.\n\nOsella returned to the European Formula Two Championship in [[1979 European Formula Two Championship|1979]], with American driver [[Eddie Cheever]] racing the well-used FA2, again powered by a BMW engine. The car was good enough to win three races and take Cheever to fourth in the championship. This was enough for Enzo Osella to take the plunge into the cut-and-thrust world of [[Formula One]].\n\n==Formula One==\n\n===Early years===\nOsella Squadra Corse appeared in the world of Grand Prix racing with its first Formula One machine, the FA1. The car was designed by [[Giorgio Stirano]]. Powered by [[Ford Cosworth DFV]], it was overweight and aerodynamically inefficient. The car was presented in a blue and white livery with large [[Denim (label)|Denim]] branding on the sidepods. Many components were manufactured in-house which meant that they were cheap to produce but not always state-of-the-art. The driver was again Eddie Cheever who was able to finish just one race in whole season. Frequently, he had to suffer from the massive unreliability of his car. In the following seasons, the basic design was changed several times.\n\nIn the early years, most of the work was done by interim designers like [[Giorgio Valentini]] or [[Tony Southgate]], but frequently Enzo Osella himself also worked on the cars. Most of these attempts brought no improvement as high-tech solutions could not be financed. [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]] finished fourth at [[San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]] in [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix|1982]] (where only 14 cars started) and scored the first Championship points for the young team in a car that was by now dubbed Osella FA1C.\n\nDespite this result, neither the financial nor the technical situation improved. Few [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] were attracted by the tiny Italian team. Denim only stayed for the first two seasons, [[Kelemata]] was no more reliable, and others like [[Landis & Gyr]] vanished as quickly as they had come. Most of the other sponsors were small or mid-size companies from [[Turin]] or the region of [[Piemont]].\n\n===Driver changes===\n[[File:Osella FA1D Bournemouth WHEELS Festival 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Osella FA1D at [[Bournemouth]] in 2016.]]\nThe lack of funding led to frequent driver changes as the team demanded that their drivers bring significant sponsorship to keep the team afloat. Some drivers started their F1 careers at Osella, such as [[Alex Caffi]] and [[Gabriele Tarquini]], while [[Piercarlo Ghinzani]] had four stints with the team. Others disappeared as quickly as they had come, such as [[Allen Berg]] and [[Franco Forini]]. Enzo Osella gave the young Austrian [[Jo Gartner]] his one and only chance to drive a Formula One car in 1984. [[Riccardo Paletti]] also had high hopes, but was killed in a start-line accident at the [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix]].\n\nNone of these drivers were able to push the team forward. Finally, Osella continued to live hand-to-mouth each year, with little or no improvement in competitiveness.\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[File:Ghinzani Osella FA1F 1984 Dallas F1.jpg|thumb|right|Alfa-Romeo derived FA1F at the [[1984 Dallas Grand Prix]], where Ghinzani achieved Osella's second and last points finish.]]\nIn the mid-1980s, Osella was the beneficiary of factory [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] engines, both in [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally-aspirated]] (1983\u201384) and [[Turbocharger|turbo]] (1984\u201388) forms. On one hand, the Alfa engine program helped the team to survive the increasingly professional turbo era; on the other hand, the heavy, unreliable and thirsty machines contributed to the team's lack of competitiveness. At least at first, Alfa offered some technical input to the team; the 1984 Osella FA1F was based on the 1983 works [[Alfa Romeo 183T]], which had been loaned to the team for \"design assistance\" purposes. All the following Osella models up to the [[Osella FA1L|FA1L]] in {{f1|1988}} had their origins in the initial Alfa design.\n\nThe Alfa turbo engine, the 890T, was not reliable. Chargers blew off regularly and power output had to be reduced down to the level of the non-turbo cars just to achieve the necessary reliability. On more than one occasion, Osella tried to replace the 890T with more up-to-date [[Motori Moderni]] turbos (which [[Minardi]] did not support) or with [[Cosworth]] engines. In the end, both were too expensive, so Osella had to stick with the increasingly outdated but cheap 890T.\n\nFor 1988 \u2013 the last year before turbos were banned \u2013 the team re-branded the 890T as the \"Osella V8\". This came about after Alfa's parent company, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Fiat]], grew tired of the negative publicity the team had given the 890T and, while allowing them to continue using the engine, refused to allow the Alfa Romeo name to be used.\n\nAfter driver [[Nicola Larini]] managed some impressive times in pre-season testing at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], the team were quietly confident of a decent showing through 1988, as many teams had switched to naturally-aspirated engines in preparation for 1989. However, the reality was that the FA1L, with its outdated turbo, was not up to the challenge: Larini often failed to qualify or even pre-qualify, and was also excluded from the [[1988 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] before practice after failing to get through scrutineering due to illegal changes made to the chassis. At the end of the season, Enzo Osella was more than happy to be finally rid of the old Alfa engine.\n\n===Cosworth power and Fondmetal===\nThe 1989 season saw much improvement. The all-new, [[Cosworth DFV#DFR|Cosworth DFR]]-powered [[Osella FA1M]] was a big step ahead, and ultra-sticky qualifying [[tyres]] from [[Pirelli]] brought some success, at least in the qualifying sessions (most notably in the [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], where Larini qualified 10th). The fine qualifying performance brought no results in the races; the Osella cars almost never saw the finish line due to several technical failures. The most tragic race was the Canadian Grand Prix in which Larini was third before the FA1M's electrics failed due to water ingress. Piercarlo Ghinzani re-joined the team for 1989 with limited success, often failing to qualify. He announced his retirement at the season ending [[1989 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]]. While Larini failed to start the very wet race when his electrics were water-logged on the grid, Ghinzani's race and career came to a violent end when a high-speed collision with the [[Lotus 101|Lotus]] of [[Nelson Piquet]] left Ghinzani with an injured ankle.\n\nIn 1990, after ten years in Formula One and still without any meaningful sponsorship, Enzo Osella sold shares in his team to metalwork magnate [[Gabriele Rumi]], as part of a sponsorship deal with Rumi's [[Fondmetal]] company. During {{f1|1990}}, the team entered a single car for French driver [[Olivier Grouillard]], who gained a reputation in F1 for being a \"blocker\", holding up faster cars and ignoring his mirrors. At the end of 1990, Rumi took over the remainder of the team and renamed it Fondmetal.\n\n==Sportscars==\n[[File:Osella PA 20 S BMW.jpg|thumb|right|BMW-powered Osella PA20]]The involvement of Gabriele Rumi meant the end of Enzo Osella's activities in Formula One. Instead he concentrated on the thing he knew best: sports car racing. During his Formula One years, he never gave up building sports cars; in fact this was one of the few projects that regularly brought work and money to Volpiano, especially in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races, with [[Maurpo Nesti]] many times winner of European and Italian Championship, and many other drivers, with PA9 and PA9/90 models.\n\nA few of those sports cars even found their way to the [[Can Am]] series, although without much success. The most prestigious result was during the 1984 Can Am season with a third place in the championship for the 2-litre class; the car was the Osella PA10 driven by Armando Trentini, and was the only two-seater in the championship; the rest of the 2-litre class field comprised single-seater F2 cars with covered wheels.\n\nIn the 1990s, Osella moved to [[Atella, Basilicata|Atella]] in the south of Italy where he built a new ultra-modern facility to produce some very competitive sports cars. Many of them were sold to privateers, while others were entered in several classes by the Osella works team. The works team was particularly successful in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races. In 1995 for instance works team driver [[Pasquale Irlando]] won all 9 races of the European hillclimb championship using the Osella PA18. He won the title in 1997, 1998 and 1999 consecutively. His successor [[Fabio Danti]] died in one of Osella's cars when he was competing in the 2000 Championship.

They participated in 132 Grands Prix between 1980 and 1990. They achieved two points finishes and scored 5 championship points.\n\n==Early days==\n[[File:Osella PA5 BMW.jpg|thumb|Osella placed second in the [[1977 World Championship for Sports Cars]] with the Osella PA5 BMW.]]\nNamed after its founder Vincenzo \"Enzo\" Osella, the team began life by racing [[Abarth]] [[sports car racing|sports car]]s in local and national races in Italy in the mid-1960s. Though relatively successful (Osella eventually took over the factory Abarth sports car program), Osella expanded into single-seater racing in 1974 to further develop his business. In 1975, the team entered the [[1975 European Formula Two Championship|European Formula Two Championship]] for the first time, achieving some success with its own car, the [[BMW in motorsport|BMW]]-powered Osella FA2.\n\nOsella continued in Formula Two in [[1976 European Formula Two Championship|1976]], but financial problems meant that the team was not competitive and withdrew from the championship before the end of the season. In the following years, the FA2s were occasionally entered by privateers, one of them being the Swiss Charly Kiser.\n\n==The late 1970s==\nEnzo Osella tried to make some money by selling a self-penned [[Formula Three]] car, the Osella FA3, with little success. Only a few privateers were optimistic enough to buy the simple, untested machine, which with [[Toyota]] or [[Lancia]] engines competed in the 1976 [[Germany|German]] and Italian F3 championships without making any great impression. After this, the team concentrated on running in local sports car events during 1977 and 1978.\n\nOsella returned to the European Formula Two Championship in [[1979 European Formula Two Championship|1979]], with American driver [[Eddie Cheever]] racing the well-used FA2, again powered by a BMW engine. The car was good enough to win three races and take Cheever to fourth in the championship. This was enough for Enzo Osella to take the plunge into the cut-and-thrust world of [[Formula One]].\n\n==Formula One==\n\n===Early years===\nOsella Squadra Corse appeared in the world of Grand Prix racing with its first Formula One machine, the FA1. The car was designed by [[Giorgio Stirano]]. Powered by [[Ford Cosworth DFV]], it was overweight and aerodynamically inefficient. The car was presented in a blue and white livery with large [[Denim (label)|Denim]] branding on the sidepods. Many components were manufactured in-house which meant that they were cheap to produce but not always state-of-the-art. The driver was again Eddie Cheever who was able to finish just one race in whole season. Frequently, he had to suffer from the massive unreliability of his car. In the following seasons, the basic design was changed several times.\n\nIn the early years, most of the work was done by interim designers like [[Giorgio Valentini]] or [[Tony Southgate]], but frequently Enzo Osella himself also worked on the cars. Most of these attempts brought no improvement as high-tech solutions could not be financed. [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]] finished fourth at [[San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]] in [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix|1982]] (where only 14 cars started) and scored the first Championship points for the young team in a car that was by now dubbed Osella FA1C.\n\nDespite this result, neither the financial nor the technical situation improved. Few [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] were attracted by the tiny Italian team. Denim only stayed for the first two seasons, [[Kelemata]] was no more reliable, and others like [[Landis & Gyr]] vanished as quickly as they had come. Most of the other sponsors were small or mid-size companies from [[Turin]] or the region of [[Piemont]].\n\n===Driver changes===\n[[File:Osella FA1D Bournemouth WHEELS Festival 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Osella FA1D at [[Bournemouth]] in 2016.]]\nThe lack of funding led to frequent driver changes as the team demanded that their drivers bring significant sponsorship to keep the team afloat. Some drivers started their F1 careers at Osella, such as [[Alex Caffi]] and [[Gabriele Tarquini]], while [[Piercarlo Ghinzani]] had four stints with the team. Others disappeared as quickly as they had come, such as [[Allen Berg]] and [[Franco Forini]]. Enzo Osella gave the young Austrian [[Jo Gartner]] his one and only chance to drive a Formula One car in 1984. [[Riccardo Paletti]] also had high hopes, but was killed in a start-line accident at the [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix]].\n\nNone of these drivers were able to push the team forward. Finally, Osella continued to live hand-to-mouth each year, with little or no improvement in competitiveness.\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[File:Ghinzani Osella FA1F 1984 Dallas F1.jpg|thumb|right|Alfa-Romeo derived FA1F at the [[1984 Dallas Grand Prix]], where Ghinzani achieved Osella's second and last points finish.]]\nIn the mid-1980s, Osella was the beneficiary of factory [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] engines, both in [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally-aspirated]] (1983\u201384) and [[Turbocharger|turbo]] (1984\u201388) forms. On one hand, the Alfa engine program helped the team to survive the increasingly professional turbo era; on the other hand, the heavy, unreliable and thirsty machines contributed to the team's lack of competitiveness. At least at first, Alfa offered some technical input to the team; the 1984 Osella FA1F was based on the 1983 works [[Alfa Romeo 183T]], which had been loaned to the team for \"design assistance\" purposes. All the following Osella models up to the [[Osella FA1L|FA1L]] in {{f1|1988}} had their origins in the initial Alfa design.\n\nThe Alfa turbo engine, the 890T, was not reliable. Chargers blew off regularly and power output had to be reduced down to the level of the non-turbo cars just to achieve the necessary reliability. On more than one occasion, Osella tried to replace the 890T with more up-to-date [[Motori Moderni]] turbos (which [[Minardi]] did not support) or with [[Cosworth]] engines. In the end, both were too expensive, so Osella had to stick with the increasingly outdated but cheap 890T.\n\nFor 1988 \u2013 the last year before turbos were banned \u2013 the team re-branded the 890T as the \"Osella V8\". This came about after Alfa's parent company, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Fiat]], grew tired of the negative publicity the team had given the 890T and, while allowing them to continue using the engine, refused to allow the Alfa Romeo name to be used.\n\nAfter driver [[Nicola Larini]] managed some impressive times in pre-season testing at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], the team were quietly confident of a decent showing through 1988, as many teams had switched to naturally-aspirated engines in preparation for 1989. However, the reality was that the FA1L, with its outdated turbo, was not up to the challenge: Larini often failed to qualify or even pre-qualify, and was also excluded from the [[1988 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] before practice after failing to get through scrutineering due to illegal changes made to the chassis. At the end of the season, Enzo Osella was more than happy to be finally rid of the old Alfa engine.\n\n===Cosworth power and Fondmetal===\nThe 1989 season saw much improvement. The all-new, [[Cosworth DFV#DFR|Cosworth DFR]]-powered [[Osella FA1M]] was a big step ahead, and ultra-sticky qualifying [[tyres]] from [[Pirelli]] brought some success, at least in the qualifying sessions (most notably in the [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], where Larini qualified 10th). The fine qualifying performance brought no results in the races; the Osella cars almost never saw the finish line due to several technical failures. The most tragic race was the Canadian Grand Prix in which Larini was third before the FA1M's electrics failed due to water ingress. Piercarlo Ghinzani re-joined the team for 1989 with limited success, often failing to qualify. He announced his retirement at the season ending [[1989 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]]. While Larini failed to start the very wet race when his electrics were water-logged on the grid, Ghinzani's race and career came to a violent end when a high-speed collision with the [[Lotus 101|Lotus]] of [[Nelson Piquet]] left Ghinzani with an injured ankle.\n\nIn 1990, after ten years in Formula One and still without any meaningful sponsorship, Enzo Osella sold shares in his team to metalwork magnate [[Gabriele Rumi]], as part of a sponsorship deal with Rumi's [[Fondmetal]] company. During {{f1|1990}}, the team entered a single car for French driver [[Olivier Grouillard]], who gained a reputation in F1 for being a \"blocker\", holding up faster cars and ignoring his mirrors. At the end of 1990, Rumi took over the remainder of the team and renamed it Fondmetal.\n\n==Sportscars==\n[[File:Osella PA 20 S BMW.jpg|thumb|right|BMW-powered Osella PA20]]The involvement of Gabriele Rumi meant the end of Enzo Osella's activities in Formula One. Instead he concentrated on the thing he knew best: sports car racing. During his Formula One years, he never gave up building sports cars; in fact this was one of the few projects that regularly brought work and money to Volpiano, especially in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races, with [[Maurpo Nesti]] many times winner of European and Italian Championship, and many other drivers, with PA9 and PA9/90 models.\n\nA few of those sports cars even found their way to the [[Can Am]] series, although without much success. The most prestigious result was during the 1984 Can Am season with a third place in the championship for the 2-litre class; the car was the Osella PA10 driven by Armando Trentini, and was the only two-seater in the championship; the rest of the 2-litre class field comprised single-seater F2 cars with covered wheels.\n\nIn the 1990s, Osella moved to [[Atella, Basilicata|Atella]] in the south of Italy where he built a new ultra-modern facility to produce some very competitive sports cars. Many of them were sold to privateers, while others were entered in several classes by the Osella works team. The works team was particularly successful in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races. In 1995 for instance works team driver [[Pasquale Irlando]] won all 9 races of the European hillclimb championship using the Osella PA18. He won the title in 1997, 1998 and 1999 consecutively. His successor [[Fabio Danti]] died in one of Osella's cars when he was competing in the 2000 Championship.

Also known as ''SA-9'', it was the third operational launch of a two-stage [[Saturn I]] launch vehicle.\n\n==Objectives==\nOf 12 flight objectives assigned, two were concerned with the operation of the Pegasus satellite, eight with launch vehicle systems performance, one with jettisoning the [[launch escape system]], and one with separation of the boilerplate spacecraft. The satellite objectives were (1) demonstration of the functional operations of the mechanical, structural, and electronic systems and (2) evaluation of [[meteoroid]] data sampling in near-Earth orbit. Since the launch trajectory was designed to insert the Pegasus satellite into the proper orbit, it differed substantially from the trajectory used in missions AS-101 and AS-102.\n\n==Launch==\n[[Image:Saturn SA9 launch.jpg|left|thumb|230px|AS-103 (SA-9) launch]]\n\nThe launch vehicle consisted of an S-I first stage, an [[S-IV]] second stage, and an instrument unit. The spacecraft consisted of a boilerplate [[Apollo command module|command and service module]], a launch escape system, and a service module/launch vehicle adapter (BP-16). The [[Pegasus 1]] satellite was enclosed within the service module, attached to the S-IV stage. The orbital configuration consisted of the satellite mounted on the adapter, which remained attached to the instrument unit and the expended S-IV stage.\n\nThe vehicle was launched from Cape Kennedy Launch Complex 37B at 09:37:03 a.m. EST (14:37:03 GMT) on February 16, 1965. A hold of 1 hour and 7 minutes was caused by a power failure in the Eastern Test Range flight safety computer. A built-in hold of 30 minutes was also used to discharge and recharge a battery in the Pegasus satellite as a check that it was functioning properly.\n\nThe launch was normal, and the spacecraft was inserted into orbit approximately 10.5 minutes after launch. The launch escape system was jettisoned during launch and the command module was jettisoned after orbital insertion. The [[Pegasus (spacecraft)|Pegasus]] satellite weighed approximately 3980 pounds (1805&nbsp;kg) and was 208 by 84 by 95&nbsp;inches (5.28 by 2.13 by 2.41 m). The width of the deployed wings was 96 feet (29.3 m). The total mass placed in orbit was 33,895 pounds (15,375&nbsp;kg).  The perigee was 307.8 miles (495&nbsp;km), the apogee was 461.9 miles (743&nbsp;km), and the orbital inclination was 31.76\u00b0.\n\n==Results==\nThe trajectory and space-fixed velocity were very nearly as planned. The Apollo shroud separated from the Pegasus satellite about 804 seconds after lift-off, and deployment of two meteoroid detection panel wings of the Pegasus satellite commenced about 1 minute later. The predicted useful lifetime of Pegasus A in orbit was 1188 days. The satellite was commanded off (decommissioned) on August 29, 1968. Although minor malfunctions occurred in both the launch vehicle and the Pegasus A satellite, mission AS-103 was a success in that all objectives were met. The spacecraft remained in orbit until July 10, 1985, when it re-entered the atmosphere and landed in the ocean.\n\n{{commons category|Saturn-Apollo 9}}\n\n==References==\n{{Include-NASA}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n*[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1965-009A NSSDC: SA-9]\n*[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660020046_1966020046.pdf SA-9/Apollo firing test report]\n*[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650016419_1965016419.pdf Saturn SA-9/Pegasus A Postflight Trajectory]\n\n{{Apollo program| before=[[AS-102]]| after=[[AS-104]] <br> [[A-003]]}}\n{{Orbital launches in 1965}}\n\n{{Use American English|date=January 2014}}\n\n[[Category:Apollo program]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 1965]]\n[[Category:1965 in the United States]]\n[[Category:Test spaceflights]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched by Saturn rockets]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2013}}\n{{Infobox spaceflight\n| name                  = AS-103 \n| image                 = Pegasus satellite.jpg\n| image_caption         = Pegasus micrometeroid detection satellite as flown aboard AS-103\n| insignia              = \n\n| mission_type          = Spacecraft aerodynamics;<br>Micrometeroid investigation\n| operator              = [[NASA]]\n| COSPAR_ID             = 1965-009B \n| SATCAT                = 1088\n| mission_duration      = 3 years, 6 months, 13 days\n| orbits_completed      = ~75,918\n| distance_travelled    = {{convert|3114579139|km|mi|sp=us}}\n\n| spacecraft            = [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]] BP-16<br>[[Pegasus 1]]\n| manufacturer          = \n| launch_mass           = {{convert|15375|kg|lb}}\t\n| landing_mass          =\n\n| launch_date           = {{start-date|February 16, 1965, 14:37:03|timezone=yes}}&nbsp;UTC \n| launch_rocket         = [[Saturn I]] SA-9\n| launch_site           = [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy]] [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37|LC-37B]]\n\n| disposal_type         = Decommissioned\n| deactivated           = {{end-date|August 29, 1968}}\n| decay_date            = July 10, 1985\n\n| orbit_epoch           = 22 March 1965<ref name=\"satcat\">{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|work=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref>\n| orbit_reference       = [[geocentric orbit|Geocentric]]\n| orbit_regime          = [[Low Earth orbit]]\n| orbit_periapsis       = {{convert|500|km|mi|sp=us}}\n| orbit_apoapsis        = {{convert|736|km|mi|sp=us}} \n| orbit_inclination     = 31.7&nbsp;degrees \n| orbit_period          = 97.06&nbsp;minutes\n| apsis                 = gee\n\n| previous_mission      = [[AS-102]]\n| next_mission          = [[AS-104]]\n| programme             = [[Apollo program]]\n}}\n'''AS-103''' was the third orbital flight test of a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] [[Apollo spacecraft]], and the first flight of a [[Pegasus (satellite)|Pegasus micrometeroid detection satellite]].
