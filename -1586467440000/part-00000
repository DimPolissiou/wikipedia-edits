It is later revealed he only escaped because Maruki uses his power to create the reality where the Joker and Akechi can start over as he knew about Joker's regret of his inability to save Akechi in Shido's palace. Unable to be content in a world where his very survival is founded on a lie and disgusted with Maruki's escapist ideology, Akechi encourages Joker to fight Maruki, even if it means losing him. He joins Joker and the Phantom Thieves once again in his Black Mask outfit while still maintaining his code name. Once Maruki is defeated, Akechi remains missing and Joker is in prison like in the original game. If the player maxed Akechi's confidant level, a man in a uniform similar to Akechi's is briefly seen in the game's true ending, but whether he survived or not is unknown. \n\nAkechi is mentioned in ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]] and [[Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight]]'' as \"Pancake-loving detective,\" and he is playable as DLC along with the soundtrack, Will Power (original version).\n\nLike Joker, Akechi is a wild card and can use several Personas simultaneously. The Persona he uses as a member of the Phantom Thieves is [[Robin Hood]]; when he faces the party in his boss battle, he switches to [[Loki]] in the second half of the fight. In Persona 5 Royal, if his Confidant is maxed and Akechi is present a day before fighting Maruki, his personas will fuse together and evolve into [[Hereward the Wake|Hereward]]. With the Phantom Thieves, Akechi fights with laser [[sabers]] and [[ray gun]]s; when he fights them after revealing his true colors, he uses serrated swords and [[pistols]] with silencers (and back to using ray guns again in ''Royal''). In ''Royal's'' the new game plus, Akechi can wear his black mask outfit in Sae's palace and his Crow outfit in Maruki's palace. He is portrayed by [[Yoshihide Sasaki]] in ''Persona 5: The Stage''.<ref name=\"StagePlay\"/>\n\n===Sumire Yoshizawa===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Laura Post]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LauraPostVoice/status/1138093678457544706|title=@LauraPostVoice: I woke up to the announcement and I cannot express in words how excited I am to be playing Kasumi in Persona 5 The Royal.|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Sora Amamiya]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://p5r.jp/character/kasumi|title=\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc - \u82b3\u6fa4 \u304b\u3059\u307f; P5R - \u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca5 \u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|publisher=Atlus|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n{{nihongo|Sumire Yoshizawa|\u82b3\u6fa4 \u3059\u307f\u308c|Yoshizawa Sumire}}, known as \"Kasumi Yoshizawa\" for the majority of the game, is a character introduced in ''[[Persona 5 Royal]]'' who assumes the code name \"Violet\". She is a first-year student that transfers to Shujin Academy around the same time as Joker. She is a [[rhythmic gymnast]] and due to her abilities the school has high hopes for her. Although she has a good relationship with Joker and his friends, her opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is quite negative, saying that their actions may lead people to heavily rely on the Phantom Thieves instead of making their own efforts to solve their problems. Despite this, she later joins them when a new Palace emerges. It is eventually revealed she is actually having a fake memory of being her dead older twin sister, Kasumi. Her memories are changed via cognitive manipulation by Takuto Maruki to make her believe that she is Kasumi after the real Kasumi died pushing Sumire out of the way when she is running into traffic. Many of \"Kasumi's\" own issues, such as her klutziness and difficulty with cooking, are implied to be Sumire's subconscious awareness interfering with the implanted persona. After his corruption, Takuto revives her true memories in a ploy to convince her, Akechi, and Joker that emotional difficulties are insurmountable without his ability to construct false memories, causing Sumire to side with him in an attempt to submerge herself in her false personality again. However, inspired her seniors' determination to move on, she rejoins the party after accepting Kasumi's death.\n\nKasumi's persona is Cendrillon, based on ''[[Cinderella#Cendrillon_ou_la_petite_pantoufle_de_verre,_by_Perrault|Cinderella]]''. In battle, she fights with [[rapier]]s, lever shotguns and rifles. As a Confidant, she represents the Faith Arcana. Her Confidant is split into two parts; first as Kasumi and second as Sumire. Not long after receiving scholarship to Shujin, Kasumi is instructed not to practice for a while by her coach because she's having a choreo block. She agrees to teach the protagonist her gymnastic moves in exchange she is allowed to confide to him whenever she needs it. Her Confidant will be temporarily maxed at Rank 5. During third semester, as Sumire, her Confidant continues again. After accepting her true self, Sumire resumes her practice so that she will be acknowledged as herself instead of simply being Kasumi's sister. Once her Confidant is maxed, her Persona transforms into [[Freyja|Vanadies]]. If certain conditions are met, Sumire can use her third tier persona, Ella.\n\n===Sophia===\n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Misaki Kuno]]\n\n{{nihongo|Sophia|\u30bd\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2|Sofia}}, who assumes the codename \"Sophy\", is a character introduced in ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]''. She was first found in a box in an underground section of the Shibuya Jail by Joker after he first entered the Shibuya Jail via EMMA, a virtual assistant app, by accident. She then introduced herself as an Artificial Intelligence with her memories lost except her own name and her reason for existence, \"To be a good friend of all humans\". In the real world, she assists the Phantom Thieves as a virtual assistant such as navigation in their tour. Throughout the Phantom Thieves' adventure, she learns more about humans' emotions and began forming a bond with Joker and the rest of the Phantom Thieves. She was later revealed to be EMMA's prototype and was given her first command to be a good friend of all humans by her creator, Kuon Ichinose. However, she was deemed as a failure. Ichinose then forced a command on her to betray the Phantom Thieves. She resisted the commands after recalling her memories with the Phantom Thieves and managed to defied her creator's command, awakening her own persona to fight back. After she and the Phantom Thieves defeats Demiurge and EMMA ceased from existence, Sophia decides to accompany Ichinose on her journey, parting ways with the Phantom Thieves.\n\nSophia's persona is Pandora and represents the Star Arcana. In battle, Sophia fights with a [[Yo-yo]] and a ray gun. Outside of Jails, she resides in Joker's smartphone as she does not have a physical body.\n\n===Zenkichi Hasegawa===\n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Shin-ichiro Miki]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://p5s.jp/character/zenkichi/|title=\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc - \u9577\u8c37\u5ddd \u5584\u5409; \u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca\uff15 \u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u3000\u30b6 \u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0 \u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\u30ba \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|publisher=Atlus|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n{{nihongo|Zenkichi Hasegawa|\u9577\u8c37\u5ddd \u5584\u5409|Hasegawa Zenkichi}}, who assumes the code name \"Wolf\", is a character introduced in ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]''. He is a police officer from the Public Security Bureau and he struck a deal with the Phantom Thieves so as to find out the mastermind behind the brainwashing events around Japan. He has a daughter, Akane, but she hated him ever since her mother, Aoi Hasegawa, passed away in a hit-and-run accident and he couldn't arrest the person responsible for his late wife's death. In attempt to find a way to arrest the culprit, Zenkichi approaches the Phantom Thieves while slowly leading them to the one responsible for his wife's death. After getting to know the Phantom Thieves and they helped him mending his relationship with his daughter, Zenkichi learns to trust them and gradually become part of their team. He also allowed the Phantom Thieves to escape arrest when they were framed for murder in Okinawa and the hacking of the virtual assistant, EMMA, which led to him being temporarily arrested. The Phantom Thieves, through Sae Niijima, allowed him to be released from arrest and subsequently awaken his Persona when his daughter was manipulated to be a King for Kyoto's Jail. Since then, he officially becomes a member of Phantom Thieves until he manage to arrest the one responsible for his wife's murder.\n\nZenkichi's persona is [[Jean Valjean|Valijean]], based on the main character from Victor Hugo's novel, ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' and represents the [[The Hierophant|Priest]] Arcana. In battle, Zenkichi fights with a greatsword and wields a dual set of revolvers.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n\n===Sae Niijima===\n:Voiced by (English): Elizabeth Maxwell<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Y\u016bko Kaida]]\n{{Nihongo4|Sae Niijima|\u65b0\u5cf6 \u51b4|Nijima Sae}} is a prosecutor for the Tokyo District Special Investigation Department and [[legal guardian]] of her sister, Makoto. Although Sae cares for Makoto and helps her succeed, she sees her sister as a burden who takes what little enjoyment is left in life after their father, a police officer, was killed in the line of duty. In her disillusionment with the Japanese judicial system, Sae develops a Palace representing [[envy]] in the form of a rigged casino where she always wins. She is assigned to the Phantom Thieves case, and becomes fixated on them.\n\nAs a Confidant, Sae represents the [[Judgment (Tarot card)|Judgment]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> During the game, she [[interrogate]]s Joker about the Phantom Thieves following his arrest. Although Sae is tasked to prosecute the Phantom Thieves, she believes Joker's story and helps him escape. When she completes her Confidant she decides to become a defense attorney, and gives Joker her business card when he leaves Shibuya.

He left the government sector to work at the caf\u00e9 shortly after her death, and suspects Masayoshi Shido's involvement. Sojiro learns that Joker and his friends are the Phantom Thieves, and lets them use Caf\u00e9 Leblanc as their headquarters.\n\nAs a Confidant, Sojiro represents the [[The Hierophant (Tarot card)|Hierophant]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> During his Confidant, he is harassed and extorted by Futaba's abusive uncle. Futaba wants to defend Sojiro, but his coolness towards her causes them to argue. The protagonist helps Sojiro and Futaba reconcile; Sojiro asks Futaba to stay with him, and thanks Joker for reminding him not to take the easy path in life. When he completes his Confidant, Sojiro gives Joker a Recipe Note: a list of recipes written by Wakaba before she died.\n\n==Antagonists==\nIn ''Persona 5'', some individuals have a severely-distorted view of the world and the people around them. At a certain level characters gain a Palace, a place in the Metaverse where their desires appear. Eight palaces must be overcome, represented by the [[seven deadly sins]]; each palace has an owner with whom the main characters interact.\n\n===Suguru Kamoshida===\n:Voiced by (English): [[D. C. Douglas]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yuji Mitsuya]]\n{{nihongo|Suguru Kamoshida|\u9d28\u5fd7\u7530 \u5353|Kamoshida Suguru}} is Shujin Academy's PE teacher and volleyball coach, a former [[professional athlete]] and [[Olympics|Olympic volleyball champion]]. Kamoshida abuses and sexually assaults the students, which is ignored by the principal because of the volleyball team's fame and his status as a teacher. Kamoshida targets Ann as his latest sexual conquest; when she rejects his advances, he forces himself on her best friend, Shiho Suzui. Shiho's subsequent suicide attempt convinces Joker and Ryuji to change his heart. When Kamoshida is confronted by them and Mishima, he threatens to have the three of them expelled at the next school-board meeting.\n\nKamoshida's palace represents [[lust]] and takes the form of a castle, where he sees himself as the king due to his power at Shujin Academy. The male members of the volleyball team are depicted as being subjected to torturous training, and the female team members (as well as Ann) are viewed as his sex slaves. After his Shadow is defeated, his Treasure (an ornate crown) manifests as his [[Olympic medal]] in reality. After his change of heart, Kamoshida surrenders to the police and confesses his crimes. Unlike most of the game's palace-possessing antagonists, Kamoshida is not part of its overall conspiracy. He will be portrayed by [[:ja:\u9ad8\u6728\u4fca|Shun Takagi]] in ''Persona 5: The Stage''.<ref name=\"StagePlay\"/>\n\n===Ichiryusai Madarame===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Kyle Hebert]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yukitoshi Hori]]\n{{nihongo|Ichiryusai Madarame|\u6591\u76ee \u4e00\u6d41\u658e|Madarame Ichiry\u016bsai}} is a well-known artist who secretly plagiarizes and profits from his students' work. Yusuke's mentor, he lets him live in his run-down shack as his pupil. Yusuke admires him at first as the creator of his favorite painting, ''Sayuri'', but later discovers that Madarame stole it from his mother and let her die from a seizure. Madarame then pretended that the painting was stolen from him to fraudulently sell copies of the original to private collectors. When Ann and Yusuke discover Madarame's plagiarism, he threatens to have them arrested for trespassing after his art exhibit is over (including Joker and Ryuji).\n\nMadarame's palace represents [[vanity]], and takes the form of a lavish art museum where his students are depicted as portraits on display from which he can profit from. His treasure is the original ''Sayuri'' painting, which depicts Yusuke's mother with her infant son in her arms; Madarame had painted over her son to add mystery and make his claim that he is the painter more believable. After his change of heart, he calls a press conference to admit his crimes and plagiarism. Yusuke later gives the original ''Sayuri'' to Sojiro Sakura to hang in Cafe LeBlanc. \n\n===Junya Kaneshiro===\n:Voiced by (English): Jalen K. Cassell<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Kazunari Tanaka]] (''Persona 5''), [[Takahiro Fujimoto]] (''Persona 5: The Animation'' onwards)\n{{nihongo|Junya Kaneshiro|\u91d1\u57ce \u6f64\u77e2|Kaneshiro Junya}} is a ruthless [[yakuza]] crime lord who is responsible for enlisting students from Shujin Academy to smuggle drugs in Shibuya. Makoto, tasked by the principal to investigate, allows herself to be taken by the yakuza. When the Phantom Thieves try to rescue her, Kaneshiro blackmails them into paying him {{JPY|3 million|link=yes}} in three weeks with a threat to show photographs of them at a night club to their schools.\n\nKaneshiro's palace represents [[gluttony]] and takes the form of a bank hovering above Shibuya, where people are viewed as [[automated teller machine]]s for him to drain money from. His treasure appears as large gold bars in his palace, manifesting as a golden briefcase filled with fake money. After his change of heart, Kaneshiro deletes the photographs, voids the Phantom Thieves' debt, and surrenders to the police.\n\n===Kunikazu Okumura===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Christopher Corey Smith]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hirohiko Kakegawa]]\n{{nihongo|Kunikazu Okumura|\u5965\u6751 \u90a6\u548c|Okumura Kunikazu}} is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of Okumura Foods and [[list of Persona 5 characters#Haru Okumura|Haru Okumura's]] father. Growing up poor, Okumura transformed his family's small company into a multi-million-yen business and founded the popular Big Bang Burger fast-food chain. Because he mistreats his staff, he is the most popular suggested target on the Phantom Thieves' online poll.\n\nOkumura was part of Masayoshi Shido's circle as a sponsor until he decided to enter the political world. One of his first steps in gaining a foothold in politics is arranging a marriage between Haru and Sugimura (despite his abusive nature), who is from a politically-influential family. When Shido discovers this, he begins to see Okumura as a threat and orders him killed before the election. The conspiracy rigs the Phantom Thieves' poll to [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] and frame them for Okumura's murder. His Shadow is killed by Goro Akechi after the Phantom Thieves defeat him, resulting in him suffering a mental shutdown during a live conference before he can reveal the names of those linked to Shido.\n\nOkumura's palace represents [[greed]], and is depicted as a space station where his employees are robots that work in poor conditions and are discarded when they break down. His treasure is a mysterious orb in his palace, and manifests as a spaceship model kit he had dreamed of as a child but could not afford due to his family's poverty.\n\n===Masayoshi Shido===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Keith Silverstein]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Shuichi Ikeda]]\n{{nihongo|Masayoshi Shido|\u7345\u7ae5 \u6b63\u7fa9|Shid\u014d Masayoshi}} is a politician and a representative in Japan's [[National Diet]]. Early in the game, Shido frames Joker after he tries to prevent Shido from sexually assaulting his subordinate. He later appears as a candidate for prime minister, leading the United Future Party. To secure victory, he and his followers (including his illegitimate son, Akechi), steal Wakaba's research on \"cognitive psience,\" and use the Metaverse to cause mental shutdowns and psychotic breakdowns to eliminate potential threats and spread distrust for the current government administration. When the Phantom Thieves gain traction, he and his followers frame them for their crimes and use them to gain control of Japan.\n\nShido's palace represents [[pride]] and takes the form of a cruise ship sailing through a sunken Tokyo, where he and his conspirators live in luxury; rather than cognitive beings, the Shadows selves of Shido's conspirators also reside within the palace, having been drawn to his strong personality and ego. His treasure is a golden ship's wheel in his palace, manifesting as his legislative pin. After Shido's change of heart, he confesses his crimes in a press conference after his landslide victory. He is arrested at the end of the game, and Joker testifies against him at his trial.\n\n===Yaldabaoth===\n[[Yaldabaoth]], the god of control, is malevolent and appears in the form of the [[Holy Grail]]: a treasure of mementos created from humanity's distorted sloth. He leads the conspiracy to give Masayoshi Shido political power and sponsored the Phantom Thieves to see which is stronger: their salvation of the world or Goro Akechi's desire to destroy (and recreate) it. Yaldabaoth imprisons Igor, impersonating him until Joker unmasks his identity.\n\nHe reveals himself as power-hungry, self-righteous and sadistic, with a tendency to toy with humanity. When [[list of Persona 5 characters#Goro Akechi|Akechi]] and Shido are defeated, Yaldabaoth decides that the world should be saved; this \"salvation\" entails taking control of existence and removing everyone with chaos in their heart. He awakens his body in the core of mementos, merging them with the physical world as his palace. This gives Yaldabaoth the ability to change lies into truth, driving people into despair and complacency and erasing his enemies.\n\nHe is described as the manifestation of humanity's desire for order, warped to the point where he no longer cares for the human cost (or morality) of that order. Yaldabaoth sees humans as little more than livestock and [[lemmings]] for him to rule, due to their self-destructiveness and stupidity. He initially takes the form of the Holy Grail, which is black before the flow of wishes for him to dominate the world revitalizes him and turns the chalice gold. After the flow is cut off and the Grail is defeated, the chalice merges with his arena to become a giant, robotic, faceless angel who can manifest a gun, bell, sword, and book with each of his four arms. At the end of his fight it is revealed that he had enough power to defeat the Phantom Thieves at will, but kept fighting them out of arrogance. Until one of Phantom Thieves' allies Y\u016bki Mishima manages to convince the surviving civilians to support their fight against the evil god, leading the creation protagonist's ultimate Persona, Satanael. Yaldabaoth is finally defeated and reverts to his original, mindless form of the Holy Grail, bringing an end to his ambitions and destroying Mementos for good. \n\n==Confidants==\nLike previous ''Persona'' titles, progression of the characters' skills is based on their level of bonding with [[non-player character]]s.

Caroline is the [[Good cop/bad cop|\"bad cop\"]], with a short temper and a general dislike of Joker; she guards the entrances to the Velvet Room in Tokyo, and kicks Joker inside when he enters. Justine plays the \"good cop\" and manages the Persona Compendium, a list of the Personas Joker has owned. Calmer than Caroline, she still treats Joker as a prisoner and guards the Velvet Room entrances in Mementos.\n\nCaroline and Justine represent the [[Strength (Tarot card)|Strength]] Arcana,<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and encourage Joker to fuse certain personas with skills. When he fails to stop the Holy Grail, they remember that Yaldabaoth had captured Igor and split the pair to prevent them from acting. They fuse into {{nihongo|Lavenza|\u30e9\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c4\u30a1|Ravensha}} their true form. Lavenza calls Joker \"trickster\" instead of \"inmate\" and maintain's Justine's calm demeanor, but exhibits Caroline's aggression and impatience when Ryuji cannot understand her explanations. If the player completes Caroline and Justine's confidant, Lavenza gives Joker the key to the Velvet Room before he leaves Tokyo.\n\n===Igor===\n:Voiced by (English): [[David Lodge (voice actor)|David Lodge]] (False Igor), [[Kirk Thornton]] (Real Igor)<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Masane Tsukayama]] (False Igor), [[Isamu Tanonaka]] (Real Igor)<ref name=\"velvet jpn\"/>\n{{nihongo|Igor|\u30a4\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb|Ig\u014dru}} is the prison master of the Velvet Room.

Iwai has an adopted son, Kaoru, whose mother abandoned him when she could not sell him for drug money; unable to bring himself to tell Kaoru about his ties to the yakuza, Iwai instead told him that he was a family friend who took him in after his parents died in a car accident.\n\nIwai represents the [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|Hanged Man]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> In his Confidant, Joker is a lookout for Iwai and helps him with a deal involving his yakuza brother Tsuda (who has been forcing him to illegally customize guns). The deal becomes fraught when Tsuda threatens the lives of Iwai and the Phantom Thieves. He repents, however, admitting that he thought he was losing his place in the organization to younger members. Another yakuza, Masa, tries to take advantage of Tsuda's abandoning the deal; he threatens to kill Kaoru and reveals the truth regarding his parents. Iwai acknowledges Kaoru as his son, and Tsuda takes Masa into custody.

After Kamoshida's arrest, he realizes that Joker, Ryuji, and Ann are the Phantom Thieves. He creates and manages the Phantom Aficionados website, a fan site dedicated to the Thieves with a message board where people post requests for changes of heart. Mishima periodically sends the requests to Joker to enhance the Thieves' reputation.\n\nAs a Confidant, Mishima represents the [[The Moon (Tarot card)|Moon]] Arcana<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and will give party members experience points. His fascination with the Phantom Thieves becomes an obsession, and Joker deduces that his motivation to help springs from insecurity and his desire for popularity. When Mishima runs into his bully from middle school, he threatens to have his heart changed. After Joker confronts his Shadow in Mementos, Mishima realizes the error of his ways and saves his bully from thugs.

Kawakami avoids Joker until he learns that she is also a maid to pay the guardians of Taiki Takase, a student from the previous school she worked at. Takase worked several part-time jobs to support his guardians' hedonistic lifestyle, frequently missing school and receiving low grades. When Kawakami began to tutor him, she was ordered by the principal to stop or resign because of Takase's rumored delinquency. Takase was killed in a car accident shortly afterwards, and his guardians use his death to extort money from Kawakami, threatening to sue her if she does not comply.\n\nAs a Confidant, Kawakami represents the [[Temperance (Tarot card)|Temperance]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\"/> She helps Joker with chores and gives him free time in class. Initially saying that it pays her sister's medical bills, Kawakami's second job allows her no time to rest and she is hospitalized with exhaustion.

He is a new counselor that arrives at Shujin Academy after the arrest of Kamoshida. The students seem to really like him, as he is able to listen to them and give them good advice. Contrary to Kasumi, his opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is very positive, as he thinks their actions can bring happiness and justice to people. It is eventually revealed he is a Persona user with the ability to alter the cognitions of others, altering their personalities and memories, which he uses for truly desperate cases as a stopgap to real treatment, and a peer of Wakaba's whose research was also stolen by Shido. During the conflict with Yaldabaoth, his despair at realizing how uncaring Shujin is towards its students causes him to become vulnerable to Yaldabaoth's own ability to warp cognition, causing part of his Persona [[Adam Kadmon]] to lose a component of itself as a Treasure, causing it to degenerate into [[Azathoth]] and he enters a delusional state where he believes the only way to improve the world is to use his abilities on everyone to create a utopia, becoming the final antagonist of ''Royal''. In the bad/neutral ending, Maruki takes a photo of the phantom thieves during the graduation and leaves the gang as he created a reality that people can have happiness in their lives. In the true ending, Maruki becomes a taxi driver and offers Joker a ride as he is being followed by officers.

He later joins the Thieves (with the codename \"Crow\") after learning their identities, and forces them to change Sae Nijima's heart to clear their names. In the original game, his Confidant is automatically maxed as the story progressed. In the Royal, his Confidant is optional until Rank 8 and then turns automatic following the original game. In Rank 8 that requires the player to fight him, he gives the protagonist his hand glove as a promise that they will have a rematch.\n\nAkechi works for Masayoshi Shido as the \"Black Mask\" exploiting the Metaverse. He uses his Persona to assist Shido's campaign, but secretly plans to destroy his career by revealing himself as his illegitimate son when he becomes prime minister and avenging his mother's suicide. Akechi was forced to live in a series of abusive foster homes, and he is deeply contemptuous of society as a result. Because the Phantom Thieves are actively working against Shido, Akechi betrays them and also attempts to assassinate Joker, partly out of jealousy.<ref name=\"jealous\">{{cite video game |title=Persona 5 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=April 4, 2017 |platform=[[PlayStation 4]] |level=Shido's Palace |quote='''Akechi:''' But you... you're just some criminal trash living in an attic!

However, he is released at New Year and is unnerved by how he has no memory of how he managed to survive the attack by his cognitive self. It is later revealed he only escaped because Maruki uses his power to create the reality where the Joker and Akechi can start over as he knew about Joker's regret of his inability to save Akechi in Shido's palace. Unable to be content in a world where his very survival is founded on a lie and disgusted with Maruki's escapist ideology, Akechi encourages Joker to fight Maruki, even if it means losing him. He joins Joker and the Phantom Thieves once again in his Black Mask outfit while still maintaining his code name. Once Maruki is defeated, Akechi remains missing and Joker is in prison like in the original game. If the player maxed Akechi's confidant level, a man in a uniform similar to Akechi's is briefly seen in the game's true ending, but whether he survived or not is unknown. \n\nAkechi is mentioned in ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]] and [[Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight]]'' as \"Pancake-loving detective,\" and he is playable as DLC along with the soundtrack, Will Power (original version).\n\nLike Joker, Akechi is a wild card and can use several Personas simultaneously. The Persona he uses as a member of the Phantom Thieves is [[Robin Hood]]; when he faces the party in his boss battle, he switches to [[Loki]] in the second half of the fight. In Persona 5 Royal, if his Confidant is maxed and Akechi is present a day before fighting Maruki, his personas will fuse together and evolve into [[Hereward the Wake|Hereward]]. With the Phantom Thieves, Akechi fights with laser [[sabers]] and [[ray gun]]s; when he fights them after revealing his true colors, he uses serrated swords and [[pistols]] with silencers (and back to using ray guns again in ''Royal''). In ''Royal's'' the new game plus, Akechi can wear his black mask outfit in Sae's palace and his Crow outfit in Maruki's palace.

Although she has a good relationship with Joker and his friends, her opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is quite negative, saying that their actions may lead people to heavily rely on the Phantom Thieves instead of making their own efforts to solve their problems. Despite this, she later joins them when a new Palace emerges. It is eventually revealed she is actually having a fake memory of being her dead older twin sister, Kasumi. Her memories are changed via cognitive manipulation by Takuto Maruki to make her believe that she is Kasumi after the real Kasumi died pushing Sumire out of the way when she is running into traffic. Many of \"Kasumi's\" own issues, such as her klutziness and difficulty with cooking, are implied to be Sumire's subconscious awareness interfering with the implanted persona. After his corruption, Takuto revives her true memories in a ploy to convince her, Akechi, and Joker that emotional difficulties are insurmountable without his ability to construct false memories, causing Sumire to side with him in an attempt to submerge herself in her false personality again. However, inspired her seniors' determination to move on, she rejoins the party after accepting Kasumi's death.\n\nKasumi's persona is Cendrillon, based on ''[[Cinderella#Cendrillon_ou_la_petite_pantoufle_de_verre,_by_Perrault|Cinderella]]''.

She agrees to teach the protagonist her gymnastic moves in exchange she is allowed to confide to him whenever she needs it. Her Confidant will be temporarily maxed at Rank 5. During third semester, as Sumire, her Confidant continues again. After accepting her true self, Sumire resumes her practice so that she will be acknowledged as herself instead of simply being Kasumi's sister.

She then introduced herself as an Artificial Intelligence with her memories lost except her own name and her reason for existence, \"To be a good friend of all humans\". In the real world, she assists the Phantom Thieves as a virtual assistant such as navigation in their tour. Throughout the Phantom Thieves' adventure, she learns more about humans' emotions and began forming a bond with Joker and the rest of the Phantom Thieves. She was later revealed to be EMMA's prototype and was given her first command to be a good friend of all humans by her creator, Kuon Ichinose. However, she was deemed as a failure. Ichinose then forced a command on her to betray the Phantom Thieves. She resisted the commands after recalling her memories with the Phantom Thieves and managed to defied her creator's command, awakening her own persona to fight back.

After getting to know the Phantom Thieves and they helped him mending his relationship with his daughter, Zenkichi learns to trust them and gradually become part of their team. He also allowed the Phantom Thieves to escape arrest when they were framed for murder in Okinawa and the hacking of the virtual assistant, EMMA, which led to him being temporarily arrested.

In battle, Zenkichi fights with a greatsword and wields a dual set of revolvers.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n\n===Sae Niijima===\n:Voiced by (English): Elizabeth Maxwell<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Y\u016bko Kaida]]\n{{Nihongo4|Sae Niijima|\u65b0\u5cf6 \u51b4|Nijima Sae}} is a prosecutor for the Tokyo District Special Investigation Department and [[legal guardian]] of her sister, Makoto. Although Sae cares for Makoto and helps her succeed, she sees her sister as a burden who takes what little enjoyment is left in life after their father, a police officer, was killed in the line of duty. In her disillusionment with the Japanese judicial system, Sae develops a Palace representing [[envy]] in the form of a rigged casino where she always wins. She is assigned to the Phantom Thieves case, and becomes fixated on them.\n\nAs a Confidant, Sae represents the [[Judgment (Tarot card)|Judgment]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> During the game, she [[interrogate]]s Joker about the Phantom Thieves following his arrest. Although Sae is tasked to prosecute the Phantom Thieves, she believes Joker's story and helps him escape. When she completes her Confidant she decides to become a defense attorney, and gives Joker her business card when he leaves Shibuya.

He left the government sector to work at the caf\u00e9 shortly after her death, and suspects Masayoshi Shido's involvement. Sojiro learns that Joker and his friends are the Phantom Thieves, and lets them use Caf\u00e9 Leblanc as their headquarters.\n\nAs a Confidant, Sojiro represents the [[The Hierophant (Tarot card)|Hierophant]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> During his Confidant, he is harassed and extorted by Futaba's abusive uncle. Futaba wants to defend Sojiro, but his coolness towards her causes them to argue. The protagonist helps Sojiro and Futaba reconcile; Sojiro asks Futaba to stay with him, and thanks Joker for reminding him not to take the easy path in life. When he completes his Confidant, Sojiro gives Joker a Recipe Note: a list of recipes written by Wakaba before she died.\n\n==Antagonists==\nIn ''Persona 5'', some individuals have a severely-distorted view of the world and the people around them. At a certain level characters gain a Palace, a place in the Metaverse where their desires appear. Eight palaces must be overcome, represented by the [[seven deadly sins]]; each palace has an owner with whom the main characters interact.\n\n===Suguru Kamoshida===\n:Voiced by (English): [[D. C. Douglas]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yuji Mitsuya]]\n{{nihongo|Suguru Kamoshida|\u9d28\u5fd7\u7530 \u5353|Kamoshida Suguru}} is Shujin Academy's PE teacher and volleyball coach, a former [[professional athlete]] and [[Olympics|Olympic volleyball champion]]. Kamoshida abuses and sexually assaults the students, which is ignored by the principal because of the volleyball team's fame and his status as a teacher. Kamoshida targets Ann as his latest sexual conquest; when she rejects his advances, he forces himself on her best friend, Shiho Suzui. Shiho's subsequent suicide attempt convinces Joker and Ryuji to change his heart. When Kamoshida is confronted by them and Mishima, he threatens to have the three of them expelled at the next school-board meeting.\n\nKamoshida's palace represents [[lust]] and takes the form of a castle, where he sees himself as the king due to his power at Shujin Academy. The male members of the volleyball team are depicted as being subjected to torturous training, and the female team members (as well as Ann) are viewed as his sex slaves. After his Shadow is defeated, his Treasure (an ornate crown) manifests as his [[Olympic medal]] in reality. After his change of heart, Kamoshida surrenders to the police and confesses his crimes. Unlike most of the game's palace-possessing antagonists, Kamoshida is not part of its overall conspiracy. He will be portrayed by [[:ja:\u9ad8\u6728\u4fca|Shun Takagi]] in ''Persona 5: The Stage''.<ref name=\"StagePlay\"/>\n\n===Ichiryusai Madarame===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Kyle Hebert]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yukitoshi Hori]]\n{{nihongo|Ichiryusai Madarame|\u6591\u76ee \u4e00\u6d41\u658e|Madarame Ichiry\u016bsai}} is a well-known artist who secretly plagiarizes and profits from his students' work. Yusuke's mentor, he lets him live in his run-down shack as his pupil. Yusuke admires him at first as the creator of his favorite painting, ''Sayuri'', but later discovers that Madarame stole it from his mother and let her die from a seizure. Madarame then pretended that the painting was stolen from him to fraudulently sell copies of the original to private collectors. When Ann and Yusuke discover Madarame's plagiarism, he threatens to have them arrested for trespassing after his art exhibit is over (including Joker and Ryuji).\n\nMadarame's palace represents [[vanity]], and takes the form of a lavish art museum where his students are depicted as portraits on display from which he can profit from. His treasure is the original ''Sayuri'' painting, which depicts Yusuke's mother with her infant son in her arms; Madarame had painted over her son to add mystery and make his claim that he is the painter more believable. After his change of heart, he calls a press conference to admit his crimes and plagiarism. Yusuke later gives the original ''Sayuri'' to Sojiro Sakura to hang in Cafe LeBlanc. \n\n===Junya Kaneshiro===\n:Voiced by (English): Jalen K. Cassell<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Kazunari Tanaka]] (''Persona 5''), [[Takahiro Fujimoto]] (''Persona 5: The Animation'' onwards)\n{{nihongo|Junya Kaneshiro|\u91d1\u57ce \u6f64\u77e2|Kaneshiro Junya}} is a ruthless [[yakuza]] crime lord who is responsible for enlisting students from Shujin Academy to smuggle drugs in Shibuya. Makoto, tasked by the principal to investigate, allows herself to be taken by the yakuza. When the Phantom Thieves try to rescue her, Kaneshiro blackmails them into paying him {{JPY|3 million|link=yes}} in three weeks with a threat to show photographs of them at a night club to their schools.\n\nKaneshiro's palace represents [[gluttony]] and takes the form of a bank hovering above Shibuya, where people are viewed as [[automated teller machine]]s for him to drain money from. His treasure appears as large gold bars in his palace, manifesting as a golden briefcase filled with fake money. After his change of heart, Kaneshiro deletes the photographs, voids the Phantom Thieves' debt, and surrenders to the police.\n\n===Kunikazu Okumura===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Christopher Corey Smith]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hirohiko Kakegawa]]\n{{nihongo|Kunikazu Okumura|\u5965\u6751 \u90a6\u548c|Okumura Kunikazu}} is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of Okumura Foods and [[list of Persona 5 characters#Haru Okumura|Haru Okumura's]] father. Growing up poor, Okumura transformed his family's small company into a multi-million-yen business and founded the popular Big Bang Burger fast-food chain. Because he mistreats his staff, he is the most popular suggested target on the Phantom Thieves' online poll.\n\nOkumura was part of Masayoshi Shido's circle as a sponsor until he decided to enter the political world. One of his first steps in gaining a foothold in politics is arranging a marriage between Haru and Sugimura (despite his abusive nature), who is from a politically-influential family. When Shido discovers this, he begins to see Okumura as a threat and orders him killed before the election. The conspiracy rigs the Phantom Thieves' poll to [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] and frame them for Okumura's murder. His Shadow is killed by Goro Akechi after the Phantom Thieves defeat him, resulting in him suffering a mental shutdown during a live conference before he can reveal the names of those linked to Shido.\n\nOkumura's palace represents [[greed]], and is depicted as a space station where his employees are robots that work in poor conditions and are discarded when they break down. His treasure is a mysterious orb in his palace, and manifests as a spaceship model kit he had dreamed of as a child but could not afford due to his family's poverty.\n\n===Masayoshi Shido===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Keith Silverstein]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Shuichi Ikeda]]\n{{nihongo|Masayoshi Shido|\u7345\u7ae5 \u6b63\u7fa9|Shid\u014d Masayoshi}} is a politician and a representative in Japan's [[National Diet]]. Early in the game, Shido frames Joker after he tries to prevent Shido from sexually assaulting his subordinate. He later appears as a candidate for prime minister, leading the United Future Party. To secure victory, he and his followers (including his illegitimate son, Akechi), steal Wakaba's research on \"cognitive psience,\" and use the Metaverse to cause mental shutdowns and psychotic breakdowns to eliminate potential threats and spread distrust for the current government administration. When the Phantom Thieves gain traction, he and his followers frame them for their crimes and use them to gain control of Japan.\n\nShido's palace represents [[pride]] and takes the form of a cruise ship sailing though a sunken Tokyo, where he and his conspirators live in luxury; rather than cognitive beings, the Shadows selves of Shido's conspirators also reside within the palace, having been drawn to his strong personality and ego. His treasure is a golden ship's wheel in his palace, manifesting as his legislative pin. After Shido's change of heart, he confesses his crimes in a press conference after his landslide victory. He is arrested at the end of the game, and Joker testifies against him at his trial.\n\n===Yaldabaoth===\n[[Yaldabaoth]], the god of control, is malevolent and appears in the form of the [[Holy Grail]]: a treasure of mementos created from humanity's distorted sloth. He leads the conspiracy to give Masayoshi Shido political power and sponsored the Phantom Thieves to see which is stronger: their salvation of the world or Goro Akechi's desire to destroy (and recreate) it. Yaldabaoth imprisons Igor, impersonating him until Joker unmasks his identity.\n\nHe reveals himself as power-hungry, self-righteous and sadistic, with a tendency to toy with humanity. When [[list of Persona 5 characters#Goro Akechi|Akechi]] and Shido are defeated, Yaldabaoth decides that the world should be saved; this \"salvation\" entails taking control of existence and removing everyone with chaos in their heart. He awakens his body in the core of mementos, merging them with the physical world as his palace. This gives Yaldabaoth the ability to change lies into truth, driving people into despair and complacency and erasing his enemies.\n\nHe is described as the manifestation of humanity's desire for order, warped to the point where he no longer cares for the human cost (or morality) of that order. Yaldabaoth sees humans as little more than livestock and [[lemmings]] for him to rule, due to their self-destructiveness and stupidity. He initially takes the form of the Holy Grail, which is black before the flow of wishes for him to dominate the world revitalizes him and turns the chalice gold. After the flow is cut off and the Grail is defeated, the chalice merges with his arena to become a giant, robotic, faceless angel who can manifest a gun, bell, sword, and book with each of his four arms. At the end of his fight it is revealed that he had enough power to defeat the Phantom Thieves at will, but kept fighting them out of arrogance. Until one of Phantom Thieves' allies Y\u016bki Mishima manages to convince the surviving civilians to support their fight against the evil god, leading the creation protagonist's ultimate Persona, Satanael. Yaldabaoth is finally defeated and reverts to his original, mindless form of the Holy Grail, bringing an end to his ambitions and destroying Mementos for good. \n\n==Confidants==\nLike previous ''Persona'' titles, progression of the characters' skills is based on their level of bonding with [[non-player character]]s.

Caroline is the [[Good cop/bad cop|\"bad cop\"]], with a short temper and a general dislike of Joker; she guards the entrances to the Velvet Room in Tokyo, and kicks Joker inside when he enters. Justine plays the \"good cop\" and manages the Persona Compendium, a list of the Personas Joker has owned. Calmer than Caroline, she still treats Joker as a prisoner and guards the Velvet Room entrances in Mementos.\n\nCaroline and Justine represent the [[Strength (Tarot card)|Strength]] Arcana,<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and encourage Joker to fuse certain personas with skills. When he fails to stop the Holy Grail, they remember that Yaldabaoth had captured Igor and split the pair to prevent them from acting. They fuse into {{nihongo|Lavenza|\u30e9\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c4\u30a1|Ravensha}} their true form. Lavenza calls Joker \"trickster\" instead of \"inmate\" and maintain's Justine's calm demeanor, but exhibits Caroline's aggression and impatience when Ryuji cannot understand her explanations. If the player completes Caroline and Justine's confidant, Lavenza gives Joker the key to the Velvet Room before he leaves Tokyo.\n\n===Igor===\n:Voiced by (English): [[David Lodge (voice actor)|David Lodge]] (False Igor), [[Kirk Thornton]] (Real Igor)<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Masane Tsukayama]] (False Igor), [[Isamu Tanonaka]] (Real Igor)<ref name=\"velvet jpn\"/>\n{{nihongo|Igor|\u30a4\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb|Ig\u014dru}} is the prison master of the Velvet Room.

As Joker participates in more of her trials, he learns that Takemi had worked for a university and was fired (and blamed) for a disastrous medical trial she had opposed. She becomes more motivated after treating a young patient with a similar illness; when Joker changes the heart of her former colleague, she saves a former patient's life and regains her reputation. Before Joker leaves Tokyo, Takemi gives him a dog tag as a farewell gift.\n\n===Munehisa Iwai===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Kaiji Tang]]<br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hisao Egawa]]\n{{nihongo|Munehisa Iwai|\u5ca9\u4e95 \u5b97\u4e45|Iwai Munehisa}} is a former [[yakuza]] who owns an [[airsoft]] shop, Untouchable, in Shibuya. In the Metaverse, fake guns (and other weapons) work as well as the real thing, so Joker frequently visits Untouchable to supply the Phantom Thieves with equipment. Iwai has an adopted son, Kaoru, whose mother abandoned him when she could not sell him for drug money; unable to bring himself to tell Kaoru about his ties to the yakuza, Iwai instead told him that he was a family friend who took him in after his parents died in a car accident.\n\nIwai represents the [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|Hanged Man]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> In his Confidant, Joker is a lookout for Iwai and helps him with a deal involving his yakuza brother Tsuda (who has been forcing him to illegally customize guns). The deal becomes fraught when Tsuda threatens the lives of Iwai and the Phantom Thieves. He repents, however, admitting that he thought he was losing his place in the organization to younger members. Another yakuza, Masa, tries to take advantage of Tsuda's abandoning the deal; he threatens to kill Kaoru and reveals the truth regarding his parents. Iwai acknowledges Kaoru as his son, and Tsuda takes Masa into custody. At the end of the Confidant, Iwai gains Kaoru's trust and gives Joker a Gekko pin symbolizing protection of home and family before he leaves Tokyo.\n\n===Yuuki Mishima===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Sean Chiplock]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Daisuke Sakaguchi]]<ref name=\"mishima jpn\"/>\n{{nihongo|Yuuki Mishima|\u4e09\u5cf6 \u7531\u8f1d|Mishima Y\u016bki}}<ref name=\"mishima jpn\">{{cite web |url=http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_mishima.html | title=\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u8f1d P\uff15 \u2013 \u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca\uff15 \u2013 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 | language=Japanese | publisher=Atlus | accessdate=December 9, 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503225029/http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_mishima.html | archivedate=May 3, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> is a classmate of Joker and Ann. A member of the volleyball club, he is a frequent target of Kamoshida's abuse.

After Kamoshida's arrest, he realizes that Joker, Ryuji, and Ann are the Phantom Thieves. He creates and manages the Phantom Aficionados website, a fan site dedicated to the Thieves with a message board where people post requests for changes of heart. Mishima periodically sends the requests to Joker to enhance the Thieves' reputation.\n\nAs a Confidant, Mishima represents the [[The Moon (Tarot card)|Moon]] Arcana<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and will give party members experience points. His fascination with the Phantom Thieves becomes an obsession, and Joker deduces that his motivation to help springs from insecurity and his desire for popularity. When Mishima runs into his bully from middle school, he threatens to have his heart changed. After Joker confronts his Shadow in Mementos, Mishima realizes the error of his ways and saves his bully from thugs.

Kawakami avoids Joker until he learns that she is also a maid to pay the guardians of Taiki Takase, a student from the previous school she worked at. Takase worked several part-time jobs to support his guardians' hedonistic lifestyle, frequently missing school and receiving low grades. When Kawakami began to tutor him, she was ordered by the principal to stop or resign because of Takase's rumored delinquency. Takase was killed in a car accident shortly afterwards, and his guardians use his death to extort money from Kawakami, threatening to sue her if she does not comply.\n\nAs a Confidant, Kawakami represents the [[Temperance (Tarot card)|Temperance]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\"/> She helps Joker with chores and gives him free time in class. Initially saying that it pays her sister's medical bills, Kawakami's second job allows her no time to rest and she is hospitalized with exhaustion. When Joker changes the hearts of Takase's guardians, she quits her second job and resolves to be a better teacher. Upon completing her Confidant, Kawakami gives Joker a coupon for free maid service before he leaves Tokyo.

He is a new counselor that arrives at Shujin Academy after the arrest of Kamoshida. The students seem to really like him, as he is able to listen to them and give them good advice. Contrary to Kasumi, his opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is very positive, as he thinks their actions can bring happiness and justice to people. It is eventually revealed he is a Persona user with the ability to alter the cognitions of others, altering their personalities and memories, which he uses for truly desperate cases as a stopgap to real treatment, and a peer of Wakaba's whose research was also stolen by Shido. During the conflict with Yaldabaoth, his despair at realizing how uncaring Shujin is towards its students causes him to become vulnerable to Yaldabaoth's own ability to warp cognition, causing part of his Persona [[Adam Kadmon]] to lose a component of itself as a Treasure, causing it to degenerate into [[Azathoth]] and he enters a delusional state where he believes the only way to improve the world is to use his abilities on everyone to create a utopia, becoming the final antagonist of ''Royal''. In the bad/neutral ending, Maruki takes a photo of the phantom thieves during the graduation and leaves the gang as he created a reality that people can have happiness in their lives. In the true ending, Maruki becomes a taxi driver and offers Joker a ride as he is being followed by officers.

The model line was introduced following the construction of a personal vehicle for [[Edsel Ford]], who commissioned a coachbuilt 1939 Lincoln-Zephyr convertible, developed as a vacation vehicle to attract potential Lincoln buyers. In what would give the model line its name, the exterior was given European \"continental\" styling elements, including a [[Continental tire|rear-mounted spare tire]].\n\nIn production for over 55 years across nine different decades, Lincoln has produced ten generations of the Continental. Within the Lincoln model line, the Continental has served several roles ranging from its flagship to its base-trim sedan. From 1961 to 1976, Lincoln sold the Continental as its exclusive model line.  The model line has also gone on hiatus three times. From 1949 to 1955, the nameplate was briefly retired. In 1981, the Continental was renamed the [[Lincoln Town Car]] to accommodate the 1982 seventh-generation Continental.  After 2002, the Continental was retired, largely replaced by the [[Lincoln MKS]] in 2009; in 2017, the tenth-generation Continental replaced the MKS.\n\nAs part of its entry into full-scale production, the first-generation Continental was the progenitor of an entirely new automotive segment, the [[personal luxury car]].  Following World War II, the segment evolved into coupes and convertibles larger than [[sports car]]s and [[Grand tourer|grand touring cars]] with an emphasis on features, styling, and comfort over performance and handling. From 1956 to 1957, the Continental nameplate was the namesake of the short-lived Continental Division, marketing the 1956\u20131957 [[Continental Mark II]] as the worldwide flagship of Ford Motor Company; as a second successor, Ford introduced the [[Lincoln Mark series |Continental Mark series]] in 1969, produced over six generations to 1998.\n\nAlong with the creation of the personal luxury car segment, the Lincoln Continental marked the zenith of several designs in American automotive history. The Continental is the final American vehicle line with a factory-produced V12 engine (1948), the final four-door convertible (1967), and the final model line to undergo [[Downsize (automobile) |downsizing]] (for the 1980 model year).\n\n==Edsel Ford prototype (1939)==\nThe Lincoln Continental began life as a personal vehicle for Ford Motor Company President Edsel Ford.<ref>Dammann, George ''The Cars of Lincoln Mercury'' (Sarasota, FLA: Crestline, 1987), p. 192.</ref>  In 1938, Ford commissioned a one-off design he wanted ready for his March 1939 vacation from company Chief Stylist  [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie|Eugene T. \"Bob\" Gregorie]]. Using the blueprints of the streamlined [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] as a starting point, Gregorie sketched a design for a convertible with a redesigned body; allegedly, the initial sketch for the design was completed in an hour.\n\nAt the time work had begun on the first Continental coupe, Lincoln had previously cancelled the [[Lincoln K-series]] coupes, sedans, and limousines, and produced the very limited [[Lincoln Custom]] limousine, along with the smaller [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] coupes and sedans. Ford wanted to revive the popularity of the 1929\u20131932 [[Lincoln K-series#1932|Lincoln Victoria]] coupe and convertible but with a more modern approach, reflecting European styling influences for the Continental.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lincoln Series KA Victoria coupe|url=http://www.desertclassics.com/Linc32KAcp.html|website=Desert Classics|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy design, the Edsel Ford prototype could be considered a [[Chopping and channeling|channelled and sectioned]] Lincoln-Zephyr convertible; although the vehicle wore a conventional windshield profile, the prototype sat nearly 7 inches lower than a standard Lincoln. With the massive decrease in height, the [[running board]]s were deleted entirely. In contrast to the Zephyr (and in a massive change from the K-Series Lincoln), the hood sat nearly level with the fenders. To focus on the styling of the car, the chrome trim on the car was largely restricted to the grille; instead of door handles, pushbuttons opened the doors. As with the Lincoln-Zephyr, the prototype was fitted with a 267 cubic-inch V12 engine; it was fitted with front and rear transverse leaf springs and hydraulic drum brakes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1955_Lincoln/1955-Lincoln---The-Continentals-Brochure |title=1955 Lincoln \u2013 The Continentals Brochure |website=Oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=2015-03-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090323/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1955_Lincoln/1955-Lincoln---The-Continentals-Brochure |archivedate=2015-04-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe design would introduce two long-running features used in many American automobile designs. The modified body gave the design new proportions over its Zephyr counterpart; with the hoodline sitting lower over the V12 engine and the passenger compartment moved rearward, the prototype had more in common with classic era \"long-hood, short deck\" body configurations versus being a strict adherent of contemporary [[streamline moderne]] design trends. As a consequence of the smaller trunk space, the spare tire was mounted behind the trunk; while disappearing on American cars, the [[Continental tire|externally mounted, covered spare tire]] remained a feature on European-produced cars.\n\nThe prototype designed by Gregorie was produced on time, making the deadline to be delivered to Edsel Ford in Florida. Interest from well-off friends was high; Edsel sent a telegram back to Michigan that he could sell a thousand of them. In reference to its European-inspired design, the Lincoln-based prototype received its name: Continental.\n\nImmediately, production commenced on the Lincoln Continental, with the majority of production being \"Cabriolet\" convertibles and a rare number of coupes. They were extensively hand-built; the two dozen 1939 models and 400 1940-built examples were built with hand-hammered body panels; dies for machine-pressing were not constructed until 1941. The limited number of 1939 models produced are commonly referred to as '1940 Continentals'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ritch|first=Ocee |title=The Lincoln Continental |publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers & Wholesalers, Inc. |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |year=1963 |page=47}}</ref>\n\n==First generation (1940\u20131948)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = Bonhams - The Paris Sale 2012 - Lincoln Continental Coupe - 1941 - 003.jpg\n| model_years = 1940\u20131948\n| assembly = [[Lincoln Assembly]], [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />2-door [[convertible]]\n| engine = {{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Lincoln-Zephyr V12 engine|Lincoln-Zephyr V12]]\n| related = [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] (1940)<br/>[[Lincoln Zephyr V-12|Lincoln Zephyr]] (1941\u201342)<br />[[Lincoln H-series]] (post-war)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|125.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = 1940\u201341: {{convert|209.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1942\u201348: {{convert|218.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = 1940\u201341: {{convert|75.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1942\u201348: {{convert|77.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"flory2008\">{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J. \"Kelly\"|title=American Cars, 1946\u20131959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}</ref>\n| height = 1940\u201341: {{convert|62.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1942\u201348: {{convert|63.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|4000|-|4300|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer = [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie|Eugene T. \"Bob\" Gregorie]] (1938)<br> [[Raymond Loewy]] (1946 facelift)\n| caption = ''1941 Lincoln Continental coupe''\n}}\n\n[[Image:Lincoln Continental Cabriolet photo-14.JPG|thumb|left|1942 Continental with a Dutch number-plate.

The result was a boxier, somewhat heavier look in keeping with then-current design trends, but perhaps less graceful in retrospect. 1942 production was shortened, following the entry of the United States into World War II; the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] led to the suspension of production of automobiles for civilian use.\n\nAfter World War II, the Lincoln division of Ford returned the Continental to production as a 1946 model; Lincoln dropped the Zephyr nomenclature following the war, so the postwar Continental was derived from the standard Lincoln (internally H-Series). To attract buyers, the design was refreshed with updated trim, distinguished by a new grille. For 1947, walnut wood trim was added to the interior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1947_Lincoln/1947_Lincoln_Folder/1947%20Lincoln-a04.html |title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1947_Lincoln/1947_Lincoln_Folder |website=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Edsel Ford in 1943, Ford Motor Company re-organized its corporate management structure, which led to the 1946 departure of the Continental's designer Bob Gregorie. That year's Continental, the first postwar model, was designed by famed industrial stylist [[Raymond Loewy]]. 1948 would become the last year for the Continental, as the division sought to redevelop its new 1949 model line as an upgraded version of the Mercury; the expensive personal-luxury car no longer had a role at Lincoln.\n\nThe 1939\u20131948 Continental is recognized as a \"Full Classic\" by the [[Classic Car Club of America]], one of the last-built cars to be so recognized. As of 2015, the 1948 Lincoln Continental and 1948 Lincoln were the last cars produced and sold by a major U.S. automaker with a V12 engine.<ref name=\"flory2008\" />\n{{Commons category-inline|Lincoln Continental (first generation)}}{{clear}}\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n{{Multiple image|align = center|direction = |header = 1939\u20131948 Lincoln Continental|image1 = Lincoln Continental Cabriolet photo-12.JPG|caption1 = 1942 Lincoln Continental cabriolet|image2 = Lincoln Continental Cabriolet photo-69.JPG|caption2 = 1942 Lincoln Continental cabriolet interior|caption3 = 1948 Lincoln Continental cabriolet|image3 = Lincoln Continental Cabriolet (1948) in Belgium (2015).JPG|image4=1948 Lincoln Continental Mark II V12 (5940153008).jpg|caption4=1948 Lincoln Continental coupe|image5=1948 Lincoln Continental Mark II V12 interior (5939596569).jpg|caption5=1948 Lincoln Continental coupe interior}}</div>\n\n==Second generation (1956\u20131957)==\n{{Main|Continental Mark II}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image = File:1956 Continental Mark II - midnight blue - fvr.jpg\n|caption = Continental Mark II\n|name = Second generation\n|manufacturer = Continental Division (Ford)\n|model_years = 1956\u20131957\n|assembly = [[Ford Pilot Plant|Allen Park Assembly]], [[Allen Park, Michigan]], United States\n|layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n|body_style = 2-door [[hardtop]]\n|engine = {{convert|368|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine|''Y-block'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|transmission =\n|wheelbase = {{convert|126.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = {{convert|218.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{convert|77.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|56.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|5000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|designer = Bill Schmidt\n}}\nAfter an eight-year hiatus, for the 1956 model year, the Continental nameplate made its return; to launch the vehicle, Ford created a namesake Continental division centered around its new flagship vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1956_Lincoln/1956_Continental_Mark_II_Brochure/1956-Continental-Mark-II-04|title=1956 Continental Mark II sales brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208123647/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1956_Lincoln/1956_Continental_Mark_II_Brochure/1956-Continental-Mark-II-04|archive-date=2015-12-08|access-date=4 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946\u20131975|last=Gunnell|first=John|publisher=Krause Publications, Inc|year=2002|edition=4th|location=Iola, WI|page=498}}</ref>  To again highlight the European influence of the original Continental, Ford assigned the \"Mark II\" suffix to the new Continental (also in an effort to distinguish itself from the similar [[Bentley R Type#R-Type Continental|Bentley Continental]]).

With a large number of power-equipment features included, the Mark II was offered with only a single option: air conditioning priced at $595.\n\nOn a unique, low-slung chassis sharing its 126-inch wheelbase dimension with the Lincoln Capri and Premiere, the Mark II was assembled with its own body panels and interior; each vehicle was hand-built, with hand-sanding and finishing of body panels. In several elements of its design, the Mark II broke from American styling precedent. As with a Rolls-Royce or [[Mercedes-Benz W189|Mercedes-Benz 300d]], the Mark II essentially restricted chrome trim to the window trim, grille, and bumpers. With a nearly flat hood and trunklid, the Mark II was also designed with neither tailfins (prominent on American sedans) nor [[Ponton (car)|pontoon fenders]] (then current in Europe). Rather than a separate assemblage the \"[[Continental spare tire]]\" was now integrated into the deck lid stamping, serving to accommodate the vertically-mounted spare tire beneath.<ref>{{cite book|title=Classic American Cars|last=Wilson|first=Quentin|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|year=1997|location=New York, NY|page=64}}</ref>\n\nIn total, 2,996 Continental Mark IIs were produced (including two prototype convertibles).<ref name=\":1\">Gunnel, p. 499.</ref>  As a consequence of the nearly hand-built construction, Ford estimated it lost nearly $1000 on every Continental Mark II produced.<ref>{{cite book|title=80 Years of Cadillac La Salle|last=McCall|first=Walter|publisher=Crestline Publishing|year=1982|location=Sarasota FL|page=26}}</ref>  After 1957, the Mark II was discontinued; the Continental Division was re-branded as a competitor to Imperial and Cadillac (rather than Rolls-Royce and Bentley).<gallery>\nFile:Elvis Presley Automobile Museum Memphis TN 2013-03-24 030 1956 Lincoln Continental Mark II.jpg|1956 Continental Mark II, originally owned by [[Elvis Presley]]\nFile:Continental 1957 MarkII LSideFront Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14874759364).jpg|1957 Continental Mark II\nFile:Continental 1957 MarkII RSideRear Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14854220726).jpg|1957 Continental Mark II, showing rear ''[[Continental tire|Continental spare tire]]'' trunklid \nFile:57 Continental Mark II (7810973532).jpg|Continental Division emblem on rear trunklid, 1957 Mark II \nFile:Continental 1956 MarkII HenryFordII cockpit Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14690528548).jpg|Dashboard, 1956 Continental Mark II \nFile:56 Continental Mark II (7810892536).jpg|Exterior view of front seats, 1956 Mark II\nFile:Continental 1956 MarkII HenryFordII engine Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14874156821).jpg|Lincoln 368 cubic-inch [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine|''Y-block'']] V8, 1956 Mark II \n</gallery>\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Lincoln Continental (second generation)}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Third generation (1958\u20131960)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation\n| image = Lincoln Continental Wasen.jpg\n| caption = 1959 Continental Mark IV Landau\n| manufacturer = 1958: Continental Division (Ford)<br>1959\u20131960: Lincoln-Mercury Division (Ford)\n| model_years = 1958\u20131960\n| assembly = United States: [[Wixom, Michigan]] ([[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]])\n| designer = [[John Najjar]]\n| class = [[Luxury vehicle#High-end luxury/full-size luxury cars|Full-size luxury car]] ([[F-segment|F]])\n| body_style = 2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[convertible]]<br />4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br />4-door ''Landau'' [[hardtop]]<br />4-door ''Town Car'' [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br />4-door ''[[Limousine]]''\n| chassis = [[Unibody]]\n| related = [[Lincoln Premiere#1958\u20131960|Lincoln Premiere]]<br/>[[Lincoln Capri#1958\u20131959|Lincoln Capri]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| engine = {{convert|430|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford MEL engine#430|''MEL'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Cruise-O-Matic|''Turbo-Drive'']] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|131.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1959\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1959_Lincoln/1959_Lincoln_Brochure/1959%20Lincoln-17.html |title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1959_Lincoln/1959_Lincoln_Brochure |website=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n| length = 1958: {{convert|229.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958-Lincoln-12|title=1958 Lincoln-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002031123/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958-Lincoln-12|archivedate=2016-10-02}}</ref><br />1959: {{convert|227.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1960: {{convert|227.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = 1958\u201359: {{convert|80.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1960: {{convert|80.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = 1958: {{convert|56.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1959\u20131960: {{convert|56.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|5000|-|5700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n}}\nTo build a better business case for its flagship and the division that marketed the vehicle, the Continental model line underwent extensive changes for the 1958 model year. To widen its sales potential, Ford required Continental to reach a $6000 price (a 40% reduction from the Mark II), allowing the division to better compete against [[Cadillac Eldorado]] and [[Imperial (automobile)#Second generation (1957\u20131966)|Imperial LeBaron]].<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://newfreelifestyle.com/?p=1742|title=LINCOLN CONTINENTAL MARK IV 1960|date=2016-08-27|website=newfreelifestyle.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217223951/http://newfreelifestyle.com/?p=1742|archive-date=17 February 2017|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>  To allow for production at a larger scale, the Continental model line was more closely integrated with Lincoln, differing primarily in roofline, trim, and grille.  For 1959, Ford cancelled the Continental Division outright, with its model line remaining through the 1960 as part of the model cycle. \n\nThe first all-new unibody design since World War II, this generation of the Continental is one of the largest sedans ever built by Ford Motor Company (or any American automaker).<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|date=January 1959|title=Annual Auto Section|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNsDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|journal=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Magazines|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>     \n\n===Development===\nTo facilitate continuation of the Continental model line, the division was forced to abandon hand-built construction. Sharing a common chassis and much of the exterior of the Lincoln Premiere, Continental production shifted to the then-new Wixom Assembly plant.\n\nTo set itself apart from a Lincoln, along with a division-specific grille, all versions of the Continental (including convertibles) were styled with a reverse-slant roofline, fitted with a retractable \"[[Breezeway (car)|breezeway]]\" rear window. First introduced on the 1957 [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser]], the feature allowed for augmented interior ventilation (along with air conditioning). Unlike the Turnpike Cruiser, the reverse slant of the roofline included the rear window, an element that would reappear on Mercury sedans in the next decade. \n\nThe Continental Mark III was designed by [[John Najjar]], Chief Stylist of Lincoln, assisted by [[Elwood Engel]] largely drawing influence from the 1955 Ford La Tosca concept model designed by Alex Tremulis.  Engel would style the 1959 Mark IV, with Don Delarossa (who replaced Najjar as Lincoln Chief Stylist in 1957) developing the 1960 Mark V.<ref name=\":2\" />  As a result of its massive size and the configuration of its headlights, the model line was nicknamed the \"slant-eyed monster\" in the Ford design studio.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n===Chassis/body===\nThe 1958\u20131960 Continental Mark III\u2013V are built upon the same mechanical components utilized by the Lincoln Capri and Premiere.  For 1958, Lincoln split further from Mercury in body design as part of ongoing efforts to outdo Cadillac, with Lincoln adopting unibody construction for the first time;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958-Lincoln-10-11|title=1958 Lincoln-10-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002041759/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958-Lincoln-10-11|archivedate=2016-10-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> the Continental shares a common body with the Premiere, with the exception of the reverse-slant roofline.\n\nShared with Lincoln, Mercury, and the [[Ford Thunderbird (second generation)|Ford Thunderbird]], the Continental Mark III\u2013V were fitted with a 430 cubic-inch [[Ford MEL engine|MEL]] V8 engine; a 3-speed [[Cruise-O-Matic|Turbo-Drive]] automatic was the sole transmission. In 1958, the engine produced 375&nbsp;hp, and was retuned to 350&nbsp;hp in 1959, making 315&nbsp;hp in 1960.\n\nUsing a 131-inch wheelbase, the 1958 Continentals are the longest-wheelbase sedans ever built by Ford Motor Company. Longer than a Ford Excursion, the 1958\u20131960 Continentals are the longest sedans ever produced by Ford without [[5 mph bumper]]s. The 1958 Continental Mark III convertible is the longest convertible ever mass-produced in the United States, with the sole exception of the (extremely rare) 1934\u20131937 [[Cadillac V-16|Cadillac V16]] convertibles.\n\n===Models===\nIn line with the previous Continental naming tradition, Continental introduced its 1958 model line as the Mark III. In a break from previous practice, the two subsequent model years were marketed as incrementally increased \"marks\" (Marks IV and V).\n\n====Mark III (1958)====\nFor 1958, Continental released the Mark III in four bodystyles, including a 2-door hardtop and convertible, a 4-door pillared sedan, and a four-door hardtop sedan (called Landau). Although far less expensive than the Mark II, the Mark III remained well-equipped, retaining air conditioning as an option (relocated from the ceiling to the dashboard).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1957_Lincoln/1957_Lincoln_Brochure/1957%20Lincoln-10-11.html|title=1957 Lincoln Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>  The Mark III became the first Ford Motor Company vehicle to offer an FM radio tuner (as a rarely ordered option).<ref name=\"flory2008\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958%20Lincoln-12.html|title=1958 Lincoln Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>  A unique option was \"Auto Lube\", allowing for the car to lubricate itself (as long as an oil reservoir was kept full).<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1959\" />\n\n====Mark IV (1959)====\nFor 1959, the Continental Mark IV saw a minor restyling, with the elimination of [[Dagmar bumpers|Dagmars]] from the front bumpers and side sculpting becoming much less deeply drawn. Coinciding with the end of the Continental Division, \"Continental III\" fender badging is replaced by separate \"Continental\" and \"Mark IV\" badging. The grille is restyled slightly, with the headlight clusters now integrated into the egg-crate grille.\n\n====Mark V (1960)====\nFor 1960, the Continental Mark V saw another styling update, with flatter front bumpers (with Dagmars). The Continental badging was restyled, with \"Mark V\" badging moved to the rear fenders. On the front fenders, several horizontal chrome strakes were added. Using a similar layout as the Mark IV, the Mark V was given a restyled grille.\n\n====Town Car/Limousine====\nAlongside the Mark III, IV, and V, there are two additional models of the third-generation Continental. In 1959, Lincoln added the Limousine and Town Car bodystyles; the latter marked the first use of the Town Car name by Lincoln. Available only in black, both versions were built with a model-specific formal rear roofline with a padded roof; the Limousine featured a partition between the front and rear seats. The roofline of Town Car and Limousine was designed in an effort to avoid extending the wheelbase; the deletion of the reverse-slant rear window allowed for the rear seat to be moved rearward several inches.\n\nThe 1959\u20131960 Town Car and Limousine are among the rarest Lincoln vehicles ever sold; only 214 examples of the $9,200 Town Car were produced and only 83 examples of the $10,200 Limousine were produced.<ref name=\":2\" />\n<gallery>\nFile:Continental Mk.

From 1958 to 1960, the Lincoln Division would lose over $60 million; along with the launch of newly developed vehicles in a recession economy (a factor that contributed to the downfall of the Edsel line), Lincoln and Continental was faced with overcoming the expense of developing a vehicle that was shared with neither Ford nor Mercury.\n\nIn 1961, as Lincoln redesigned its model line, the Continental went from being the flagship Lincoln to the only model line sold by the division (for the next 16 years). In the mid-1960s, Ford made a decision to develop a new successor to the Mark II, naming it the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III, effectively beginning the]] [[Lincoln Mark series|Mark series]]. As with the Mark II and the 1958-1960 Continentals, it was sold, marketed, and serviced by Lincoln, though not officially badged as such.

This was extended to 126 inches from 1964 to 1969.\n\nThe only engine available was the {{convert|430|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford MEL engine#430|MEL V8]] carried over from the Mark V. It was expanded to [[Ford MEL engine#462|462]] cubic inches in 1966, becoming the largest-displacement engine ever used in a Ford Motor Company passenger car. A new engine, the {{convert|460|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford 385 engine|''385-series'']]-based V8, took its place in 1969, shared with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]]. All versions of the Continental were fitted with a 3-speed automatic transmission.  New for 1966 was Ford's C6 automatic, designed for use in big block, high-horsepower V8 engines.\n\n===Body===\nAt its 1961 launch, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental was offered solely as a four-door, as either a sedan or a convertible. For the first time on a Lincoln since 1951, rear doors were rear-hinged ([[suicide door]]s). To alert drivers of open doors, Lincoln fitted the dashboard with a \"Door Ajar\" warning light (as seen on many modern automobiles). Latching together at the B-pillar with a vacuum-operated central locking system, convertibles used an abbreviated pillar while sedans were \"pillared hardtops\". In the configuration, a thin B-pillar supported the roof structure while all four doors utilized frameless door glass (in the style of a hardtop or convertible); the layout would become used by several Ford Motor Company sedans during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn what would be the first four-door convertible from a major American manufacturer after World War II, the Lincoln Continental convertible was fitted with a power-operated top on all examples. Deriving its mechanism from the [[Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner]] hardtop convertible, the Continental was fitted with a fabric roof that stored under a rear-hinged deck lid/filler panel. In a similar fashion as the Skyliner, to access the trunk for storage, the deck lid was opened electrically (without raising or lowering the roof).\n\nA somewhat rare and unusual option for 1964\u20131965 was the vertically adjustable steering column. Unlike most tilt-adjustable columns that employ a lever-activated locking pivot joint just behind the steering wheel the Lincoln version employed a vacuum-actuated clamp, a dash-mounted height indicator window and a pivot point much further down the column.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Ford Swing-Away, Tilt-Away, and Tilt Steering Wheels|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/tbird1961swingaway.html|website=Automotive Mileposts|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:1960s Lincoln Continental convertible with suicide doors open.jpg|Lincoln Continental\nFile:1961 Lincoln Continental Convertible (20907384860).jpg|Lincoln Continental convertible \nFile:66Continental.jpg|Lincoln Continental convertible\n</gallery>\n\n===Model timeline===\nDuring its production, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental would be produced in three versions, undergoing model revisions in 1964 and 1966.\n\n===1961\u20131963===\nThe 1961 Lincoln Continental was introduced with four-door sedan and four-door convertible versions, replacing the Lincoln Premiere and Lincoln Continental Mark V.

The front seatbacks were modified in an effort to increase rear seat legroom. To increase luggage space, the trunklid was reshaped. In line with a number of vehicles in the United States, the electrical charging system introduced an [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]], replacing the [[Dynamo|generator]].\n<gallery>\nFile:1961 Lincoln Continental Sedan.jpg|1961 Lincoln Continental sedan \nFile:1962 Lincoln Continental convertible (6263500306).jpg|1962 Lincoln Continental convertible (Australian right-hand drive)\nFile:1962 Lincoln Continental convertible (6262975751).jpg|1962 Lincoln Continental convertible\nFile:1962 Lincoln Continental convertible (6263496568).jpg|1962 Lincoln Continental convertible (Australian right-hand drive)\nFile:1963 Lincoln Continental Sedan.jpg|1963 Lincoln Continental\n</gallery>\n\n===1964\u20131965===\nFor 1964, the Lincoln Continental underwent its first mid-cycle redesign. Alongside styling updates, several functional changes were focused towards increasing rear-seat space. The wheelbase was increased from 123 to 126 inches, shifting the rear seats backward.   The roofline underwent several changes, with the adoption of flat side glass (replacing curved window glass). To increase rear headroom, the rear roofline became additionally squared off, in a notchback style.\n\nIn a slight exterior restyling, to eliminate the \"electric shaver\" appearance, the front fascia added vertical chrome accents to the grille; the recessed rear grille was replaced by a much simpler decklid with trim panel (moving the fuel-filler door to the left-rear fender). The interior was completely revised with a full-width instrument panel, updated upholstery patterns, door panels and fittings.\n\nIn 1964, Lincoln debuted the Continental Town Brougham concept car,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/lincoln/lincoln1964townbroughamshowcar.html|title=1964 Lincoln Continental Town Brougham Show Car \u2013 AUTOMOTIVE MILEPOSTS|publisher=}}</ref> which had a 131 in. wheelbase, overall length at 221.3, and had a retractable glass partition between the front and rear compartments, with an exposed area over the front compartment, in typical 1930s style [[town car]]/[[Brougham (car body)|brougham]] appearance.\n\nFor 1965, Lincoln made additional updates to the Continental. In a styling change, the convex \"electric shaver\" front fascia was replaced by a more angular blunt hood with an upright flat grille design. As part of the redesign, the front turn signals and parking lights are moved from the front bumpers to wraparound lenses on the front fenders, with similar parking lights/turn signals on the rear; all four lights received metal trim to match the horizontal lines of the new grille. To improve braking ability, the Continental was given Kelsey-Hayes [[disc brake]]s for the front wheels; in addition, front seat belts with retractors became standard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1965_Lincoln/1965_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure/1965%20Lincoln%20Continental-14%20001.html |title=1965 Lincoln Continental Brochure |website=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:1964 Lincoln Continental (28446300583).jpg|1964 Lincoln Continental sedan\nFile:1964 Lincoln Continental (28446257193).jpg|1964 Lincoln Continental sedan, rear\nFile:1964 Lincoln Continental (29064050575).jpg|1964 Lincoln Continental sedan, interior\nFile:1965 Lincoln Continental Convertible (9347201253).jpg|1965 Lincoln Continental convertible\nFile:1965 Lincoln Continental Sedan.jpg|1965 Lincoln Continental sedan \n</gallery>\n\n===1966\u20131969===\n[[File:Royal motorcade (8075978363).jpg|thumb|right|[[British royal family]] in 1967 Continental]]\nFor 1966, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental underwent a second mid-cycle redesign. To better compete against the [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville]] and the [[Imperial (automobile)#1966|Imperial Crown Coupe]], Lincoln introduced its first two-door pillarless hardtop since 1960. The convertible remained offered solely as a four-door. In an effort to increase sales of the five year-old model range, Lincoln reduced the price of the Continental nearly $600 from 1965 while keeping equipment levels identical.<ref>Flory, p. 454.</ref>  The marketing decision proved successful; boosted by the introduction of the two-door body style, the model range increased sales by 36%.<ref name=\"Flory, p.456\">Flory, p. 456.</ref>\n\nWhile following much of the 1965 restyling (distinguished largely by a new grille and the addition of \"Continental\" to the hood), the 1966 Lincoln Continental wore an all new body, growing 5 inches longer (implemented primarily in the rear seats to accommodate more leg room), and nearly an inch taller and wider. Curved side glass made its return (with less obvious [[tumblehome]], to increase interior room). To offer an engine sized comparably to those in the Imperial (440 cubic inches in 1966) and Cadillac (429 cubic inches, 472 cubic inches in 1968), the 430 V8 was enlarged to 462 cubic inches.\n\nThe convertible underwent several equipment revisions for the first time, adding a glass rear window and the top mechanism added a second hydraulic pump for opening the convertible roof and the trunklid (making the two systems separate); hydraulic solenoids were deleted from the top mechanism. The interior underwent several revisions, adding a tilt steering wheel and an 8-track tape player as options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1966_Lincoln/1966_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure/1966%20Lincoln%20Continental-16.html|title=1966 Lincoln Continental Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n\nFor 1967, the Lincoln Continental was given only minor trim updates, with the deletion of the Lincoln star emblem from the front fenders being the largest change. Several functional changes were made, as Lincoln added a number of indicator lights to the dashboard. Along with an oil pressure warning light, the dashboard was given indicator lights for an open trunk and the cruise control (if on).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1967_Lincoln/1967_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure/1967%20Continental-18.html|title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1967_Lincoln/1967_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure|work=oldcarbrochures.com}}</ref>  Following federal safety mandates, lap safety seatbelts became standard equipment, coupled with an energy-absorbing steering column.\n\nFollowing years of decreasing sales, 1967 marked the final year of the Lincoln Continental convertible, with only 2,276 sold.<ref>Flory, p. 529.</ref><ref name=\"Flory, p.530\">Flory, p. 530.</ref>  After becoming the first four-door convertible sold after World War II, the Lincoln Continental would become the final (as of the 2018 model year) example of its type sold by an American manufacturer. As a result of numerous frame reinforcements (in comparison to the sedan), the 5,712 pound 1967 Lincoln Continental convertible is one of the heaviest passenger cars ever sold by Ford Motor Company.<ref>Gunnell, p. 132.</ref>\n\nFor 1968, several updates were made to the Continental, primarily in response to federal safety mandates. To meet requirements for side marker lights, wraparound lenses were returned to the fenders; the front turn signals were styled similar to the Continental Mark III. The \"Continental\" wording was removed from the front fascia, replaced by the Lincoln star emblem (as seen on the rear); the hood ornament was deleted, in anticipation of a federal ban on the feature (which never came to effect). For the interior, torso seatbelts were added for the outboard front seats.\n\nIntended as a 1968 introduction, the all-new 460 cubic-inch [[Ford 385 engine|385-series/Lima]] V8 was shared with the Mark III, introduced as an early 1969 model.<ref name=\":5\">Flory, pp. 603 & 679.</ref>  However, the supply of 462 engines was sufficient to last through most of the model year, pushing the introduction of the 460 in the Continental towards the end of the model year.<ref name=\":6\">''Cars of the Sizzling '60s'', p. 348.</ref>\n\nFor 1968, Lincoln made several styling changes to the Continental. To meet federal safety standards, the parking lights, taillights, and front turn signals were returned to a wraparound design on the fenders to satisfy Federal standards for side marker lights. For the outboard front seats, shoulder seatbelts were added. The new {{convert|460|cid|l|abbr=on}} [[Ford 385 engine]] was to be available at the beginning of the model year, but there were so many {{convert|462|cid|l|abbr=on}} [[Ford MEL engine]] engines still available, the 460 was phased in later that year.<ref name=\":6\" /> In April, the new [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Mark III]] made its debut, as a 1969 model.<ref name=\":5\" /> Total sales would be down to just 39,134.<ref name=\":7\">Flory, p. 605.</ref>\n\nFor 1969, few changes were made in the final year of production. To comply with federal regulations, the front seats were updated with [[head restraint]]s for the outboard passengers.<ref>''Ibid''., p.393.</ref>  The front fascia was updated, with the grille enlarged for the first time since 1965, with the \"Continental\" wording returning above the grille. Shared with the Mark III, the 460 V8 became the sole engine for the Lincoln Continental, paired with the Ford C6 3-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAfter a nine-year hiatus, the Town Car name made a return in 1969 as part of an interior trim option package for the Continental.\n<gallery>\nFile:1966 Lincoln Continental (2388878850).jpg|1966 Lincoln Continental sedan\nFile:Light blue Continental p1.JPG|1966 Lincoln Continental convertible \nFile:1967 Lincoln Continental coupe (8451927672).jpg|1967 Lincoln Continental two-door hardtop\nFile:Lincoln Continental Front.jpg|1967 Lincoln Continental four-door sedan \nFile:Lincoln Continental Heck.jpg|1967 Lincoln Continental four-door sedan, rear view\nFile:1968 Lincoln Continental (24408734302).jpg|1968 Lincoln Continental four-door sedan\nFile:1968 Lincoln Continental (24490799876).jpg|1968 Lincoln Continental sedan, rear view \nFile:1969 Lincoln Continental coupe (6880507298).jpg|1969 Lincoln Continental hardtop coupe\nFile:1969 Lincoln Continental (16369774371).jpg|1969 Lincoln Continental four-door\n</gallery>\n\n=== Presidential state cars ===\n[[File:President John F.

Building on the success of the Mark III introduced the year before, Lincoln sought to modernize the Continental for the 1970s after a nine-year production run.\n\nAlthough shorter in wheelbase and slightly narrower than 1958\u20131960 Lincolns, the addition of 5-mph bumpers make 1977\u20131979 Lincolns the longest automobiles ever produced by Ford Motor Company.\n\n===Chassis===\nThe fifth-generation Lincoln Continental is based on body-on-frame construction, the first Lincoln to do so since 1957. To save on its engineering and development costs, the Continental was no longer given its own chassis, instead given a longer-wheelbase version of the Mercury Marquis chassis (stretched from 124 inches to 127 inches; 1974\u20131979 vehicles received a 127.2-inch wheelbase).\n\nShared with the LTD and Marquis, the Continental was equipped with coil springs at all four corners. From 1970 to 1974, the Continental was fitted with front disc and rear drum brakes;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1970_Lincoln/1970%20Lincoln%20Continental%20Brochure/1970%20Lincoln%20Continental-07.html|title=1970 Lincoln Continental Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref> from 1975 to 1979, four-wheel disc brakes were available.<ref name=\":8\">Dammann, p. 492.</ref>\n\nThe 460 cubic-inch V8 returned as the standard engine, becoming available from 1970 to 1977; from 1970 to 1972, the 460 remained exclusive to Lincoln. In an effort to increase fuel economy and comply with emissions standards, Lincoln added a 400 cubic-inch V8 for California for 1977, with the 460 remaining available in 49 states. For 1978, the 400 became standard (with the 460 as an option), with the 460 discontinued for 1979. Both engines were paired with the Ford C6 3-speed automatic transmission.\n\n===Body===\nIn a major departure from its fourth-generation predecessor, the 1970 Lincoln Continental's Marquis-based frame forced the sedan to abandon \"suicide doors\" for conventional front-hinged doors. As with its predecessor and the Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was offered as a two-door hardtop and as a four-door \"pillared hardtop\" sedan (B-pillar with frameless door glass). Unlike Ford or Mercury, no Lincoln two-door convertible was introduced.\n\nShared with the Mark series, the fifth-generation Continental was equipped with vacuum-operated [[hidden headlamp]]s; as a fail-safe, the headlamp doors were designed to open in the event of failure (a dashboard indicator light indicated their status).<ref name=\"1970Brochure\" />\n\n===Model timeline===\nDuring its production, the fifth-generation Lincoln Continental was sold in two versions, with a major revision in 1975. Following the downsizing of the full-size General Motors and Chrysler product lines, the Lincoln Continental became the largest mass-market automobile produced worldwide for the 1977 model year. It was surpassed only by purpose-built limousines such as the long-wheelbase version of the Mercedes-Benz [[Mercedes-Benz 600|600]], the Rolls-Royce [[Rolls-Royce Phantom VI|Phantom VI]], and the [[ZIL-4104]]. Following the 1979 downsizing of the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was marketed as the final \"traditional\" or \"large\" sedan in the United States.\n\n===1970\u20131974===\nFor 1970, Lincoln introduced a redesigned Continental two-door, Continental four-door, and Continental Town Car; sold only as a four-door, the Town Car was distinguished by a vinyl roof.\n\nFor 1971, the grille underwent a minor styling change, partially in an effort to better distinguish the Continental from the Mercury Marquis. The grille and headlight doors were redesigned, with the latter painted in body color. Rear-wheel ABS brakes (called Sure-Trak) was optional.<ref>{{cite book |title=1971 Lincoln Continental & Mark III |publisher=The Ford Motor Company |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---June/1971-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-III-Brochure-Cdn/1971-Continental-Mark-III-Cdn--08-09 |access-date=2018-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140112/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---June/1971-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-III-Brochure-Cdn/1971-Continental-Mark-III-Cdn--08-09 |archive-date=2018-06-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor 1972, several functional changes were made, as the 460 V8 decreased in compression; though intended to decrease emissions and adapt to unleaded gasoline, output dropped. The tradition of Lincoln-exclusive engines came to an end, as Mercury began use of the 460 in the Mercury Marquis and Colony Park as an option. Minor styling changes were made, as the grille and the fenders were restyled; to better separate the Continental from the Mark IV, Lincoln reintroduced chrome fender trim. For the first time since 1967, the Continental was equipped with a hood ornament. On the inside, more rear seat legroom was added.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---December/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mk-VI-Brochure/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-IV-02 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220124222/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---December/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mk-VI-Brochure/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-IV-02 |archivedate=2016-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nFor 1973, the Lincoln Continental was brought into compliance with federal crash regulations as it was fitted with a 5-mph front bumper. While a number of vehicles underwent significant revisions to comply with the regulation, the Continental was able to meet the standard by moving its front bumper several inches forward and fitting it with rubber-tipped impact overriders. The rear bumper was modified in a similar manner, with a 2 1/2&nbsp;mph rating; in total, the Continental gained nearly 5 inches in length.\n\nAs a counterpart to the Continental Town Car, a two-door Continental Town Coupe was introduced. In a similar fashion as the Town Car, the Town Coupe was distinguished by its padded vinyl top.\n\nFor 1974, the Lincoln Continental was given a new grille, moving from an egg-crate style to a waterfall design. As part of federal regulations, a 5-mph bumper was added to the rear, leading to a redesign of the rear bumper; the taillamps were moved from inside the bumper to above it.\n<gallery>\nFile:Lincoln Continental (13241720114).jpg|1970 Lincoln Continental\nFile:Lincoln Continental (13241540833).jpg|1970 Lincoln Continental, rear view\nFile:1972 Lincoln Continental 1.jpg|1972 Lincoln Continental \nFile:1972 Lincoln Continental rear.jpg|1972 Lincoln Continental, rear view \nFile:1973 Lincoln Continental Town Car sedan (12404237654).jpg|1973 Lincoln Continental Town Car\nFile:1973 Lincoln Continental brown with white roof.jpg|1973 Lincoln Continental coupe\nFile:'74 Lincoln Continental Town Car (Auto classique VAQ Beaconsfield '13).JPG|1974 Lincoln Continental Town Car \n</gallery>\n\n===1975\u20131979===\nAfter 5 years on the market, Lincoln made an extensive revision to the Continental. Coinciding with the 1975 introduction of the [[Mercury Grand Marquis]], Lincoln and Mercury sought to better visually differentiate their two flagship model lines, in spite of their mechanical commonality. As part of the revision, the Lincoln Continental was able to adopt a greater degree of styling commonality with the Continental Mark IV. For 1975, the exterior of the Lincoln Continental underwent a major revision. Although the body below the beltline saw only minor change with the taillights redesigned with vertical  units, the roofline was completely restyled. To separate itself from the Mark IV, the two-door Continental/Town Coupe adopted a fully pillared roofline with a square opera window in the C-pillar. In place of the pillared hardtop shared with the Mercury Marquis and Ford LTD, the four-door Continental/Town Car adopted a wide B-pillar; to distinguish itself from the [[Cadillac Sixty Special#1971\u20131976|Cadillac Sixty Special Brougham]]; Town Cars were given the oval opera window introduced on the Mark IV. Along with the styling upgrades, 1975 Lincolns received substantial upgrades to the braking system. Designed by [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]],<ref name=\":8\" /> the Lincoln Continental became one of the first American cars equipped with a 4-wheel disc brake system (as an option). To further improve the emissions performance of the 460 V8, the engine was fitted with catalytic converters, ending its compatibility with leaded regular gasoline.\n\nFor 1976, the exterior remained essentially the same as the year before (marking the first carryover styling year for Lincoln since 1963). In an effort to price the Continental more competitively, Lincoln deleted a number of previously-standard features, making them extra cost options.\n\nFor 1977, the Lincoln Continental would undergo another exterior revision. The wide Mercury-style grille was replaced by a narrower Rolls-Royce radiator-style grille, nearly identical to the Mark V (variations of the radiator grille would remain in use on Lincolns through 1997). In another trim revision, the \"Continental\" script was removed from the rear fenders.\n\nFor 1978, the dashboard was updated for the first time, as the Lincoln Continental adopted a revised version of the Mercury Grand Marquis dashboard. In addition to increasing parts commonality, the update was done to save weight; the plastic-frame Mercury dashboard was lighter than the previous steel-frame version. In a similar move, Lincoln redesigned the rear fender skirts, adopting a version that covered less of the rear wheels. Alongside the optional sliding glass sunroof, a fixed glass moonroof with an interior sunshade was introduced (for the first time since the [[Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria Skyliner|1955 Ford Skyliner]]).<ref>http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/lincoln/78lin/bilder/11.jpg</ref>\n\nFor 1979, the interior underwent further updating, as the Mercury-sourced dashboard received additional wood trim. The 460 V8 was deleted from the Lincoln/ Mark V model line entirely, leaving the 400 V8 as the sole engine.\n<gallery>\nFile:'75 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe (Rassemblement Rigaud '13).jpg|1975 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe \nFile:Lincoln Continental (1972), Dutch licence registration 42-YA-61 pic1.JPG|1975-1976 Lincoln Continental Town Car\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Town Car sedan (8453059332).jpg|1977 Lincoln Continental Town Car\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Town Car sedan (8453062686).jpg|1977 Lincoln Continental Town Car, rear view \nFile:Lincoln Continental (10098586186).jpg|1978 Lincoln Continental (standard trim)\nFile:1978 Lincoln Continental Coupe (6) (3436151487).jpg|1978 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe, showing glass moonroof\nFile:1978 Lincoln Continental Coupe (27) (4417815333).jpg|1978 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe interior \nFile:Opera window of '79 Town Car.jpg|Opera window, 1979 Lincoln Continental Town Car\n</gallery>\n\n===Special editions===\nThroughout its production, the fifth-generation Lincoln Continental was offered with several special-edition option packages. In contrast to the Mark series, the fifth-generation Continental was not offered with any Designer Series editions.\n\n====Golden Anniversary (1971)====\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of Lincoln in 1971, a ''Golden Anniversary Town Car'' was offered as a limited-edition option package for the Lincoln Continental. Although technically available in any of 25 paint colors available for any Lincoln, the Golden Anniversary Town Car featured an exclusive gold moondust metallic paint color as an option; 1,040 examples were painted in the gold moondust color.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/lincoln/lincoln1971goldenanniversary.html|title=1971 Lincoln Continental Golden Anniversary Town Car|website=automotivemileposts.com|access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref>  All examples were given a color-keyed vinyl roof with a color-keyed leather interior (with trim exclusive to the package).<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nOther features included a commemorative brochure, a glove compartment vanity mirror, a commemorative plaque on the dashboard, and keys plated in 22 carat gold presented in a jewelry box.<ref name=\":9\" />  In total, 1,575 examples were produced; initial production was 1,500 vehicles, with an additional 75 produced exclusively for employees within Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n====Williamsburg Edition (1977\u20131979)====\nFrom 1977 to 1979, Lincoln sold a ''Williamsburg Edition'' Continental Town Car. Intended as a cosmetic option package, the Williamsburg Edition was the only Continental or Town Car sold with two-tone paint;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/contentslincoln.shtml|title=1952-1979 Lincoln and Lincoln Continental {{!}} AUTOMOTIVE MILEPOSTS|website=automotivemileposts.com|access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref> the edition also standardized a number of options. Along with two-tone paint, the Williamsburg Edition also included a full vinyl roof, pinstriping, power vent windows, lighted vanity mirrors, and 6-way twin \"Comfort Lounge Seats\".\n\nFor 1977, the option package was designed as one of the most conservative versions of the Town Car, without any opera windows or coach lights fitted to the roofline. For 1978 and 1979, the opera windows and coach lights were added to the roofline.\n\n==== Collector's Series (1979) ====\nTo commemorate the end of production of the Lincoln Continental and Continental Mark V while denoting them as the final \"traditional\" full-size American sedans and coupes, Lincoln offered a ''Collector's Series'' for both the Continental and Mark V. As with its Mark V counterpart, the Continental Collector's Series was equipped with essentially every available feature as standard equipment. Only four options were available for the Collector's Series: a power moonroof, 40-channel CB radio, \"Sure-Track\" [[anti-lock brakes]], and a plush Kashmir velour interior (in lieu of leather). The Continental Collector's Series could reach $18,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|18000|1979}}}} in current dollars) when fully equipped; within Ford Motor Company, it was only surpassed by its $22,000 Mark V Collector's Series counterpart at the time.\n\nAlong with four options, the Continental Collector's Series was produced in four colors: dark blue, white and limited-issue medium blue (197 built) and light silver (125 built) with a dark-blue vinyl top.\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Lincoln Continental (fifth generation)}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Sixth generation (1980)==\n{{See also|Lincoln Town Car|Lincoln Continental Mark VI}}\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Sixth generation\n|image = 1980 Lincoln Continental Coupe, front right (Hershey 2019).jpg\n|caption = 1980 Lincoln Continental Coupe\n|interiorcaption = \n|manufacturer = [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln-Mercury]] ([[Ford Motor Company|Ford]])\n|aka = Lincoln Continental Town Car/Town Coupe\n|model_years = 1980\n|assembly = United States: [[Wixom, Michigan]] ([[Wixom Assembly]])\n|factory = [[Wixom Assembly]]\n|class = [[Luxury vehicle#High-end luxury/full-size luxury cars|Full-size luxury sedan]]\n|body_style = 2-door coupe<br>4-door sedan\n|platform = [[Ford Panther platform|Ford Panther]]\n|chassis = body-on-frame\n|related = [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD Landau]]<br>[[Mercury Grand Marquis]]\n|layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n|engine = Ford ''[[Ford 302 engine|5.0L small block]]'' V8\n|transmission = 4-speed ''[[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]]'' overdrive automatic\n|wheelbase = {{convert|117.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = {{convert|219.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{convert|78.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|56.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4061|-|4147|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|successor = [[Lincoln Town Car]]\n}}With the impending adoption of federal fuel-economy standards ([[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]]) making the large cars of the 1970s a potential financial threat to Ford Motor Company, the full-size cars of all of its divisions underwent extensive downsizing for the 1979 model year. For various reasons, delays pushed the release of the downsized Lincoln model lineup into 1980, three years after the downsizing of its Cadillac counterparts. The downsizing undergone by the 1980 Continental and Mark VI provided Lincoln with the best year-to-year fuel economy improvement (38%) in Ford history.<ref>Dammann, p. 528.</ref> The introduction of a standard overdrive transmission enabled the division to leap its competitors, going from the company with the worst [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]] rating to the most fuel-efficient full-size car sold.\n\nOne of the most touted options the 1980 Continental offered was the new digital instrument cluster, which used vacuum fluorescent displays for the vehicle speedometer, odometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gauge. However, the biggest feature was the included \"trip computer\" that showed the driver \"miles to empty\" and (based on driver input) an \"estimated time of arrival\", as well as real-time average fuel economy figures. The digital instrument cluster with the trip computer, along with the engine's new standard electronic fuel injection, 4-speed AOD transmission, power steering and suspension advances, and the new EEC III engine management system allowed the 1980 Lincoln Continental to gain a major technological advantage over its competition; instead of being just a mere redesign and downsize of the 1979 models, the 1980 Continentals would be some of the most advanced vehicles ever sold by Ford up to that point.\n\nThis version of the Continental would last only for a single model year. To eliminate saturation of the Lincoln model line, the car was re-released as the [[Lincoln Town Car]] for 1981, while the Continental name would move to the midsize segment as an early 1982 model. While not officially announced as the replacement for the Versailles, the 1982 Continental would become the Lincoln competitor for the Cadillac Seville. After the end of its model cycle, the Continental Mark VI was replaced by the Mark VII, a far different vehicle.\n\n===Chassis===\nCentral to the redesign was the adoption of the all-new [[Ford Panther platform]], shared with the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis. While retaining the body-on-frame layout of its predecessor and using a rear-wheel drive powertrain, the Panther platform made major engineering changes to lower curb weight. In addition, the chassis itself was smaller in several key dimensions. While only approximately 2 inches narrower, the 1980 Continental shed 10 inches of its wheelbase and 14 inches in length. In losing nearly 1000 pounds of curb weight, the 1980 Continental came within 200 pounds of the curb weight of the \"compact\" Lincoln Versailles.\n\nIn its focus on fuel economy, the Panther platform was developed without the use of the 400 or 460 V8s powering full-size Lincoln-Mercurys throughout the 1970s. In their place was the first fuel-injected V8 engine produced by Ford Motor Company. Based on the 302 cubic-inch small block V8, the newly christened 129&nbsp;hp 5.0L V8 (rounded up from its true 4.9L displacement) was the first \"metric-displacement\" American Ford engine. As an option, a 140&nbsp;hp carbureted 351 cubic-inch Windsor V8 was available. In place of the C6 3-speed automatic transmission was an all-new 4-speed Automatic Overdrive Transmission ([[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]]). Developed under the name Ford Integral Overdrive (FIOD), this industry-first transmission featured both a mechanically-engaged [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] (0.67/1 ratio) fourth gear and third and fourth-gear [[torque converter]] lock-up.\n\nThe new Panther platform allowed for changes in the new Continental's suspension geometry and many improvements were made to the power steering. With this, and the reduced overall size, the 1980 Lincoln Continental was able to retain the traditional big car ride and feel, while offering a major enhancement to its handling. Compared to the 1980 Continental's GM and Chrysler counterparts and the 1979 Lincoln models, the new car offered more agile maneuvering, as well as a reduced turn diameter by over 8 feet (compared to the 1979 Lincoln Continental).\n\n===Body===\nAlthough sharing a common platform and powertrain with the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was well differentiated from its counterparts; no visible body panels were common between the three vehicles. In contrast, the 1980 Continental was positioned as the base model of the Lincoln model line; the Continental Town Car/Town Coupe made its return as the top-trim model. As all Continentals wore padded roofs, Continental Town Cars were largely differentiated by two-tone paint. Lincolns were differentiated from Continental Mark VIs by their exposed headlights and full-width taillamps (instead of a \"Continental spare tire trunk\"). Two-door Lincolns can be distinguished from Mark VI two-doors with their \"notchback\" roofline; they share a common wheelbase with four-door Lincolns. {{Clear}}\n\n==Seventh generation (1982\u20131987)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Seventh generation\n| image = 82LincolnContinental.jpg\n| caption = 1982 Lincoln Continental Givenchy Edition\n| model_years = 1982\u20131987\n| assembly = United States: [[Wixom, Michigan]] ([[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]])\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| platform = [[Ford Fox platform]]\n| related = [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Lincoln Mark VII]]<br />[[Ford Thunderbird (eighth generation)|Ford Thunderbird (1980\u20131982)]]<br />[[Mercury Cougar#1980-1982|Mercury Cougar XR7 (1980\u20131982)]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| engine = {{convert|149|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[BMW M21]]'' [[turbodiesel]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br/>{{convert|232|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)#232|''Essex'']] [[V6]]<br/>{{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Ford 302 engine|''5.0L small block'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Ford AOD transmission|''AOD'']] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br/>4-speed [[ZF 4HP22 transmission|ZF 4HP22]] automatic (turbodiesel)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|108.5|-|108.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|200.7|-|201.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|73.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|55.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|3384|-|3706|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n| predecessor = [[Lincoln Versailles]] (RWD)\n| successor = [[Lincoln LS]] (RWD)\n| image_caption = 1982 Lincoln Continental\n}}\nFollowing the downsizing and adoption of the Panther platform for the 1980 model year, the Lincoln division was faced with a critical issue. After the discontinuation of the compact [[Lincoln Versailles]] early in 1980, Lincoln was left with two full-size sedans. Although each was brand-new for the model year, the Lincoln Continental and Continental Mark VI were functionally identical vehicles. Aside from the \"Continental tire\" trunklid, unique rear quarter panels, different taillamps and [[hidden headlamp]]s of the Mark VI, the two vehicles offered little differentiation.\n\nThe Lincoln Continental made its return in early 1981 as a 1982 model. To further separate Continental from the Town Car, Lincoln designers shifted the Continental nameplate into the mid-size segment. Only offered as a four-door sedan, the Continental was styled with a \"bustle-back\" rear end and marketed to compete directly with the [[Cadillac Seville]] and the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]. Using the lessons learned from Lincoln Versailles and [[badge engineering]], Lincoln stylists took great care to differentiate the expensive Continental from the Ford Granada and Mercury Cougar sedans sharing the [[Ford Fox platform]] with it; unlike the Versailles, no visible body panels were shared. The Continental shared its wheelbase and powertrain with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Continental Mark VII]] introduced for the 1984 model year.\n\nBeginning with the 1981 model year, all manufacturers were required to use a 17 character VIN-code. The first three digits is the [[Vehicle identification number|World Manufacturer Identifier]] which gives the make of the car. 1982\u20131985 Continental 4-door sedans have the separate VIN-code 1MR which designates Continental as the make instead of 1LN as Lincoln (as is the Town Car).\nIn 1986, the situation was clarified by Ford Motor Company as the Continental was reassigned the 1LN VIN-code to designate Lincoln as the make.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cars Of Lincoln-Mercury|last=Dammann, George H.|first=Wagner, James K.|publisher=Crestline Publishing Co.|year=1987|isbn=978-0912612263|location=Sarasota, Florida|pages=414, 545, 577, 582, 583}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=List of manufacturers of motor vehicles and their trailers - numerical - SV 3.2 |url=https://www.kba.de/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/SV/sv32_pdf_en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=6 |publisher=Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt |location=Germany |date=2018-01-15 |access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref>\n\n===Chassis===\nShifting from the Ford Panther platform to the [[Ford Fox platform]], the Lincoln Continental became a mid-size car for the first time. In its redesign, the Continental would lose nearly 9 inches in wheelbase and 18 inches in length, along with over 400 pounds of weight. Although it would be the shortest-wheelbase Lincoln ever (at the time), the Continental would use a stretched 108.5\" wheelbase version of the Fox platform used by the [[Ford Thunderbird (eighth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] and [[Mercury Cougar]]. In marked contrast to its Cadillac Seville competitor, which switched to a front-wheel drive GM platform, the Continental retained the use of rear-wheel drive.\n\nThe 1982 Lincoln Continental was fitted with two different engines. The standard engine was a 131&nbsp;hp carbureted version of the 5.0L V8. At no cost, a 3.8L V6 (shared with the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar<ref>Flammang, p. 603.</ref>) was an option; it was the first non-V8 Lincoln since 1948. Both engines were discontinued for the 1983 model year, replaced by the fuel-injected 5.0L V8 from the Town Car. All three engines were fitted with the 4-speed [[Ford AOD transmission|Ford AOD overdrive transmission]]. As a response to the diesel engine options available in Cadillacs and a number of European luxury brands, Lincoln introduced an optional 114-hp 2.4L turbodiesel inline-6 sourced from BMW (with a ZF 4-speed automatic transmission) for 1984. WIth only 1,500 sold, the diesel-powered Continental was rarely ordered and discontinued after the 1985 model year. The seventh-generation introduced two features as industry firsts: gas-charged shock absorbers and self-sealing tires.\n\n=== Body ===\n[[File:Lincoln Continental (Auto classique St-Bruno-De-Montarville VAQ '13).JPG|left|thumb|1984\u20131987 Lincoln Continental]]\n[[File:Lincoln Continental (4282952655).jpg|left|thumb|1986\u20131987 Lincoln Continental]]\nFor the first time on a Lincoln-badged Continental, its namesake \"Continental spare tire trunk\" seen on the Mark Series was used as a decklid design feature. In addition, the decklid was lettered \"CONTINENTAL\" instead of \"LINCOLN\" (as was the Versailles, the first Lincoln to do so). As Ford Motor Company intended for the Lincoln Continental to compete against the Cadillac Seville, the rear half of the car was designed with a sloping \"bustle-back\" decklid, drawing inspiration from the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] of the late 1930s. The decklid design of the Continental proved less extreme than that of the Seville. The addition of a horizontal brushed-chrome strip that ran along each side of Continental, along with plentiful two-tone color combinations, gave it a more conventional appearance in comparison to the Cadillac.\n\nCoinciding with the introduction of the two-door Continental Mark VII, the Lincoln Continental was given a styling update for the 1984 model year. The body was fitted with flush-fitting front and rear bumpers and revised taillamps. While not fitted with the composite headlights of the Mark VII, the front fascia of the Continental was revised with an angled grille flanked by recessed quad headlamps and larger wrap-around marker lights incorporating cornering lamps, which made it more aerodynamic looking. On the inside, the doors and dashboard were fitted with satin-black trim (accented with low-gloss genuine walnut veneer for the 1986 model year only). Other changes through the rest of production run were primarily limited to paint colors and upholstery pattern details. The car continued thereafter with few changes. All models were also fitted with Ford's door-mounted Keyless Entry System, not to be confused with a [[Remote keyless system|Remote Keyless Entry System]].<ref>{{cite web|title = 1982 Lincoln Continental-16-17|url = http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1982-Lincoln/1982-Lincoln-Continental-Brochure/1982-Lincoln-Continental-16-17|website = oldcarbrochures.org|accessdate = 2015-09-09|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160107075145/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1982-Lincoln/1982-Lincoln-Continental-Brochure/1982-Lincoln-Continental-16-17|archivedate = 2016-01-07}}</ref>\n\n===Trim===\nFor 1982, the Continental was offered in base trim, Signature Series, and Givenchy Designer Series trim. For 1983, the Signature Series trim was discontinued and given to the Town Car and Mark VI; the Valentino Designer Series was added. After the 1985 model year, the Valentino Designer Series was discontinued in favor of the Givenchy Series. Including many additional standard features, the Signature Series, Valentino, and Givenchy Designer Series Continentals added $3,100 to $3,500 to the price of a standard model. Fully optioned Signature and Givenchy models would top out at over $26,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|26500|1982}}}} in current dollars).\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Lincoln Continental (seventh generation)}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Eighth generation (1988\u20131994)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image = A 1991 Lincoln Continental.jpg\n|caption = 1991 Lincoln Continental\n|name = Eighth Generation\n|related  = [[Ford Taurus]]<br />[[Mercury Sable]]<br />[[Ford Windstar]] \n|model_years = 1988\u20131994\n|production = October 1987\u20131994<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99914907/</ref>\n|platform = Ford FN9 platform\n|layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n|assembly =United States: [[Wixom, Michigan]] ([[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]])\n|body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n|engine = 3.8 L [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|''Essex'']] [[V6]]\n|transmission = 4-speed [[Ford AXOD transmission#AXOD-E|AXOD-E]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|109.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---Sept/1990-Lincoln-Continental-Prestige-Brochure/1990-Lincoln-Continental-Prestige-24-25-26</ref>\n|length = 1988\u20131993: {{convert|205.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1994: {{convert|205.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = 1988\u20131993: {{convert|72.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1992\u201394: {{convert|72.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = 1988\u20131991: {{convert|55.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1992\u201394: {{convert|55.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|designer = Jack Telnack (1984)\n}}\n[[File:1989 Lincoln Continental Signature Series.jpg|thumb|left|1989 Lincoln Continental Signature Series]]\n[[File:88-91 Lincoln Continental.jpg|thumb|left|1990\u20131993 Lincoln Continental]]\n[[File:92-94 Lincoln Continental.jpg|thumb|left|1994 Lincoln Continental]]\nBy the late 1980s, the luxury segment in which the Continental competed had changed drastically from a decade before. In addition to traditional competitors Cadillac and Chrysler, the Continental now competed against [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[BMW]], and [[Audi]] as well as the top of the line vehicles of [[Acura]], [[Lexus]], and [[Infiniti]]. In anticipation Lincoln had chosen to completely reinvent the Continental, starting with development of eighth generation model in the 4th quarter of 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0LnCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=en53+1987+ford&source=bl&ots=2iRBfpPpcP&sig=ACfU3U1qtiQ9ibFDXbMdAo-nxv7NW6f61g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjb1N2hnp7gAhVPZawKHVUqBXIQ6AEwCHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=en53+1987+ford&f=false|title=The Perpetual Enterprise Machine: Seven Keys to Corporate Renewal Through Successful Product and Process Development|first1=H.

This Continental became the first front-wheel drive Lincoln and the first Lincoln since 1948 sold without an available V8 engine. As part of a more conservative exterior, the sloping  \"Continental trunklid\" was deleted. Although four inches longer, it was 170 pounds lighter than its predecessor. For the first time since 1980, the Continental closely matched its [[Cadillac Seville#1986.E2.80.931991|Seville]] counterpart in size.\n\nBy interior volume the Continental was the largest front-wheel drive car sold in 1988, and was recognized by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' on its 1989 [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]]. Power was provided by a 140&nbsp;hp 3.8L Essex V6 newly introduced to the Taurus/Sable for 1988. An exclusive feature to the Continental was adaptive air-ride suspension and variable assist power steering was standard. In 1990 (MY 1991), engine output was revised to 155&nbsp;hp, and to 160&nbsp;hp for MY 1993. All Continentals were equipped with a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission.\n\n===Body===\nWhile the exterior of the Continental adopts many of the flowing lines, including the flush-mounted glass, flush-mounted headlights, and wraparound doors of its counterparts alongside the Taurus, it also adopts several more conservative styling features, including a more upright C-pillar, chrome grille, and long deck, and the redesign of the sloping trunklid increased trunk space from 15 to 19 cubic feet (nearly matching the Town Car).\n\nIn October 1988 for 1989 model year, a redesigned dashboard was introduced to accommodate dual air bags. This unprecedented move made the Ford Motor Company the first US automaker to offer airbags as standard equipment for both the driver and front passenger (the second automaker worldwide after Porsche's 1987 944 Turbo).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Ford-Offers-Airbags-For-Passengers-As-Standard-Equipment/id-79d97f461ef138ab538726bf1b418ead|title=Ford Offers Airbags For Passengers As Standard Equipment|work=apnewsarchive.com}}</ref> In 1989 for the 1990 model year, a minor exterior update featured a new grille, hood ornament, and taillights. In late 1993 for MY 1994, a larger facelift was given, including new bumpers, rocker moldings, and bodyside moldings. Exterior trim was redesigned including a restyled argent-colored grille, redesigned taillamps, revised decklid trim, and the Lincoln nameplate is moved onto the grille and taillamps. The bucket seat option was given a redesigned steering wheel.\n\n===Trim===\nAs part of the redesign, Lincoln simplified the trim lineup; only standard (later named \"Executive\") and Signature Series remained. \nFor the first time since 1981, 6-passenger seating made its return. Leather seats were standard (with velour available as a no-cost option). Major options included a compact disc player, [[InstaClear]] electrically heated windshield (1988\u20131992), JBL sound system, power glass moonroof, [[keyless entry]], anti-theft alarm system, cellular phone (starting MY 1990), three-position memory seat, and choice of wheels. For model year 1993 (1992 production), an \"Individual Seats\" group was available which ditched the usual chrome column shifter and 50/50 \"comfort lounge\" split bench seating (and 6-passenger capacity) for a center console with floor shifter (a Continental first), storage armrest, cup holder, and 5 seats. 1994 was the last year that the Continental was offered in Executive and Signature Series trims. An Executive Touring package was also available.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===50th Anniversary Edition (1990)===\nA 50th Anniversary Edition Continental Signature Series was offered during MY 1990 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the model. It featured \"50th Anniversary\" badging, geometric spoked aluminum wheels with unique center hub ornaments, titanium exterior paint with unique red/blue accent striping, and two-toned interior.\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Lincoln Continental (eighth generation)}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ninth generation (1995\u20132002)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Ninth generation\n| image = 1995-1997 Lincoln Continental -- 11-26-2011.jpg\n| caption = 1995\u20131997 Lincoln Continental\n| model_years = 1995\u20132002\n| production  = November 1994\u2013July 26, 2002\n| assembly = United States: [[Wixom, Michigan]] ([[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]])\n| designer = Fritz Mayhew (1991)\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| platform = Ford FN9 platform\n| related = [[Ford Taurus]]<br />[[Mercury Sable]]<br />[[Ford Windstar]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n| engine = 4.6 L [[Ford Modular engine#4-valve|''InTech'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Ford AXOD transmission#AX4N|''AX4N'']] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|109.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = 1995\u20131997: {{convert|206.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1998\u20132002: {{convert|208.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|73.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---August/1999-Lincoln-Continental-Brochure/1999-Lincoln-Continental-06 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818093358/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---August/1999-Lincoln-Continental-Brochure/1999-Lincoln-Continental-06 |archivedate=2017-08-18 }}</ref>\n| height = {{convert|56.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|3868|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n| successor = [[Lincoln MKS]]\n}}\nFor the 1995 model year, the Continental was substantially updated with more rounded lines similar to the Mark VIII and launched on December 26, 1994;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=thTtrQVR8EIC&pg=PA554&lpg=PA554&dq=lincoln+continental+fn74&source=bl&ots=mto5vCH9Hc&sig=ACfU3U2ivIWKEVw70Yuu6DwPv6dB_uih4A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVrPys-53gAhVS7qwKHfzGB3AQ6AEwE3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=lincoln+continental+fn74&f=false|title=The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook: Strategies and Tools for Building a Learning Organization|first1=Peter M.|last1=Senge|first2=Art|last2=Kleiner|first3=Charlotte|last3=Roberts|first4=Richard B.|last4=Ross|first5=Bryan J.|last5=Smith|date=February 16, 1994|publisher=Currency, Doubleday|via=Google Books}}</ref> the interior also saw a major overhaul. Production commenced at Wixom Assembly in November 1994. While the body was all-new, the new Continental shared underpinnings with the previous generation. In a departure from the previous generation and its Ford/Mercury counterparts, the Continental was given back its V8 engine for the first time since 1987 and more closely matched the [[Northstar V8]] engine that Cadillac was using for its DeVille and Seville sedans at the time. The base price for the new Continental was $40,750 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40750|1995}}}} in current dollars).\n\n[[File:1996 Lincoln Continental 4.6L rear 9.11.18.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of 1995\u20131997 Lincoln Continental]]\nThe sole engine for the Continental was the Modular/InTech 32v DOHC 4.6L V8 shared with the Lincoln Mark VIII, but slightly de-tuned for front wheel drive use. It produced {{convert|260|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|265|lb\u00b7ft|Nm|abbr=on}} torque; {{convert|0|-|60|mph|abbr=on}} was reached in 7.2 seconds. Inside, the Continental featured a plush leather interior with many amenities and advanced electronics for the time. Some of the options included JBL sound system, 6-CD changer, power moonroof, heated seats, onboard cellular phone, anti-theft alarm system, traction control, and chrome wheels. As before, buyers could choose between five and six-passenger seating, offering [[Bridge of Weir]] leather on upper trim packages. A March 1992 customer clinic video features a final design prototype of the 1995 Continental.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjL2hpl9JBc|title=FN74 Team Visioning Overview (Voice over early 1990s)|date=11 March 2013|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n1995\u20131996 Continentals had [[air suspension|air ride suspension]] on all four wheels while the 1997 model had rear air suspension and traditional steel coil springs up front. An increasingly competitive luxury market and decontenting of the 1997 Continental saw its base price decreased by 10% that year.\n\n===1998 facelift===\n[[File:Lincoln Continental 09-12-2019.jpg|alt=1998-2002 Lincoln Continental photographed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada|left|thumb|1998-2002 Lincoln Continental]]\nThe Continental was updated again in late 1997 for 1998 with redesigned front and rear end styling. The front-end also held a strong family resemblance to the newly redesigned 1998 Town Car. Also new for 1998 was a dashboard redesign, though still keeping the reflective dash cluster. Despite these notable changes, pricing on the Continental was up only slightly over the 1997 model which itself had seen a price reduction from the year before.\n\nFor 1999, the Continental once again saw only a modest price increase to [[suggested retail price|MSRP]] $38,525 \u2014 the same price as the Town Car. The Continental offered buyers front wheel drive, while the Town Car remained rear wheel drive, and was joined by the slightly smaller [[Lincoln LS]]. This generation Continental gained seat-mounted side airbags and even more power (now up to {{convert|275|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Six-passenger capability was still available via the no-charge option of a split-bench front seat and column shifter. Also available on the 1999 Continental was the \"RESCU package\" (Remote Emergency Satellite Cellular Unit) which included Global satellite positioning (similar to GM's \"OnStar\"), 3-channel [[HomeLink]] compatible garage door opener mounted in the driver's sun visor, voice-activated cellular telephone, and the Alpine audio system (which included a digital sound processor, subwoofer amplifier, and additional speakers). One could also opt for the 6-disc CD changer, heated front seats, and a tinted glass power sunroof with sliding shade. New for 1999 was an extra-cost \"Luxury Appearance Package\" that included a wood-trimmed steering wheel and shift knob with unique two-tone seat trim and floor mats inside, and chrome alloy wheels and a special grille up front. Other available packages were the \"Driver Select System\" which included a semi-active suspension, selectable ride control, steering wheel-mounted controls for the audio and climate systems, automatic day/night outside mirrors, the \"Memory Profile System\" that recalled power steering assist and ride control settings for two drivers, and the \"Personal Security Package\" which included special [[run-flat tire]]s mounted on polished alloy wheels, low tire pressure alert system, and universal garage door opener.\n\nBetween the 2000 and 2002 model years, changes to the Continental remained relatively minor as production of the model eventually came to an end. In 2000, various safety features became standard including child seat-anchor brackets, emergency trunk release, and \"Belt Minder\" system. In 2001, the universal garage door opener was now standard. A new Vehicle Communication System (VCS) featuring hands-free voice activated phone, Safety and Security Services (SOS), information services, and route guidance assistance was optional for 2002.\n\n===Special Editions===\nFor 1996, Lincoln offered two special editions of the Continental. To commemorate the 75th anniversary of Lincoln, a ''Diamond Anniversary Edition'' of the Continental was offered as an option package. The package included \"Diamond Anniversary\" badging, leather seats, voice-activated cellular phone, JBL audio system, auto electrochromatic dimming mirror with compass, and traction control. As a continuation of the version offered the year before on the Town Car, Lincoln offered a ''Spinnaker Edition'' of the 1996 Continental. The option package featured \"Spinnaker Edition\" badging, tri-coat paint, two-toned leather seats, and 16\" spoked aluminum wheels.\n\nFor 2001, a ''Limited Edition'' was offered, featuring unique leather interior with \"Limited\" embroidery, two-toned interior trim, wood steering wheel, 6-disc CD changer, and 16\" spoked aluminum wheels. It was sold as a Greenbrier Limited Edition Continental in select markets.\n\nTo commemorate the end of the model run for 2002, a ''Collector's Edition'' was offered featuring a genuine walnut burl steering wheel, instrument panel, and side door trim, \"CE\" logos, platinum painted grille, 10-spoke chrome wheels, and more.

Along with declining sales of the model line, Lincoln faced a significant model overlap as the Continental, LS V8, and Town Car competed in nearly the same price range. As the LS V8 was a mid-size sport luxury sedan and the Town Car was a full-size luxury sedan, the Continental was withdrawn, with the final ninth-generation vehicle rolling off the Wixom Assembly production line on July 26, 2002.\n\nAfter 2002, the Continental was not directly replaced. For 2009, Lincoln introduced the MKS; while intended to replace the Town Car (which remained until 2011), the MKS was closer in length and width to the ninth-generation Continental and based on a front-wheel drive chassis (with all-wheel drive as an option). In place of a V8 engine, the MKS offered a twin-turbocharged V6 as an option. For the 2017 model year, the MKS was replaced by the new tenth-generation Continental.\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Lincoln Continental (ninth generation)}}\n\n==Tenth generation (2017\u2013present)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Tenth generation\n| image = 2019 Lincoln Continental \"Select\", front 10.29.19.jpg\n| production = 2016\u2013present\n| model_years = 2017\u2013present\n| assembly = United States: [[Flat Rock, Michigan|Flat Rock]], [[Michigan]] ([[Flat Rock Assembly Plant]])\n| designer = Max Wolff (2013), David Woodhouse (2014)\n| class = [[Full-size]] [[luxury car]] ([[F-segment|F]])\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| doors = Conventional doors (4 doors)<br>Conventional doors (front)/[[Suicide door|Coach Doors]] (rear) (Lincoln Coach Door Edition)\n| platform = [[Ford CD4 platform]]\n| related = [[Lincoln MKZ]]<br>[[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]]<br>[[Ford Mondeo]]<br>[[Ford Taurus (China)]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]] / [[Front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout|F4 layout]]\n| engine = 3.7 L ''[[Ford Cyclone engine#3.7 L|Cyclone]]'' V6<br>2.7 L ''[[Ford EcoBoost engine#V-type 6-cylinder|EcoBoost]]'' V6 [[twin-turbo]] <br>3.0 L ''EcoBoost'' V6 [[twin-turbo]]\n| transmission = [[GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission|6F55]] 6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|117.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|201.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|75.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|58.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>2017 Lincoln Continental.

The Continental is manufactured in Flat Rock, Michigan, alongside the Ford Mustang. This is the first Continental generation since 1958 that is not assembled at the Ford Motor Company [[Wixom Assembly Plant]].\n\n===Chassis===\nThe tenth-generation Lincoln Continental is based upon the [[Ford CD4 platform]]. Shared with the Ford Fusion (Mondeo) and Lincoln MKZ, the Continental shares an extended-wheelbase CD4 chassis with the seventh-generation Ford Taurus. At 117.9 inches (5.7 inches longer than the Fusion/MKZ), the Continental is the longest-wheelbase Lincoln sedan produced since 1979 with the exception of the long wheelbase L Town Cars. While front-wheel drive is standard, this generation marks the first use of all-wheel drive on a Lincoln Continental, but depending on trim, all-wheel drive is either optional or standard equipment.\n\nWhile sharing its fundamental chassis underpinnings with the Lincoln MKZ, the Continental is powered exclusively by V6 engines. As a standard engine, a 305&nbsp;hp 3.7L Ti-VCT V6, shared with the MKZ and MKS. As an option, a 335&nbsp;hp 2.7L twin-turbocharged V6 is available, shared with the Lincoln MKX. At the top of the engine lineup, the Continental is fitted with a {{Convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.0L twin-turbocharged V6; exclusive to the Continental and MKZ, the 3.0L engine is the highest-horsepower engine ever fitted to a production Lincoln car (Navigator SUV is available with {{Convert|450|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.5L twin-turbo V6 ).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} All three engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. When fitted with the 3.0L engine, all-wheel drive (with [[torque vectoring#All-Wheel Drive Vectoring|torque vectoring]]) is standard equipment. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Engine\n!Configuration\n!Output\n!Transmission\n|-\n|3.7L Ti-VCT V6 ([[Ford Cyclone engine#3.7 L|Ford Cyclone 37]])\n|{{Convert|227|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} DOHC 24V V6\n|{{Convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6500 rpm\n{{Convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000 rpm\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Ford [[GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission|6F55/SelectShift]] 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|2.7L Twin-turbocharged V6 ([[Ford EcoBoost engine#2.7-L Nano|EcoBoost Nano 2.7L]])\n|{{Convert|164|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} DOHC 24V V6\ntwin-turbocharged\n|{{Convert|335|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5500 rpm\n{{Convert|380|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3000 rpm\n|-\n|3.0L Twin-turbocharged V6 ([[Ford EcoBoost engine#3.0-L Nano|EcoBoost Nano 3.0L]]) \n|{{Convert|183|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} DOHC 24V V6\ntwin-turbocharged, gasoline direct injection\n|{{Convert|400|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5750 rpm\n{{Convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2750 rpm\n|}\n\n===Body===\nDeriving much of its exterior from the 2015 Lincoln Continental concept car, the tenth-generation Continental introduced a new design theme for the Lincoln division, shifting from the previous split grille to a rectangular design, with a slightly recessed grille. Standard equipment includes electronically-latched doors, marketed as \"E-Latch\", to pulls the door closed. Interior door panels use a button near the door pull handle to unlatch the door;<ref name=\"Lincoln Media Center\" /> on the outside, the exterior door pulls are integrated into the [[Beltline (automotive)|beltline window trim]].\n\nIn place of a console or column-mounted transmission shifter, control of the transmission was changed to \"PRNDS\" buttons mounted to the left of the infotainment/navigation touch screen. \"S\" represents \"Sport mode\", where the suspension, power steering, and transmission shifting are programmed for more spirited driving. While largely done in an effort to increase center console space, the layout is a similar approach to [[Chrysler PowerFlite transmission|Chrysler]] and [[Ultramatic#1956: Ultramatic and Touchbutton Ultramatic|Packard]] designs of the 1950s (though the Continental is also fitted with paddle shifters as standard equipment). As an option, the Continental is available with either 13 or 19-speaker audio systems from the \"Revel\" division of [[Harman International Industries|Harman]], distinguished by aluminum speaker grilles in the door panels. As with the Lincoln MKS, the Continental is fitted with adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping technology, as an option, the Continental offers a 360-degree camera system to produce a \"virtual overhead view\" of the vehicle.<ref name=\"media.lincoln.com\">https://media.lincoln.com/content/dam/lincolnmedia/lna/us/2016/01/12/effortless-power-fact-sheet.pdf</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Lincoln Continental X 02 China 2017-03-23.jpg|2017 Lincoln Continental, side view ([[Changchun, China]])\nFile:2017 Lincoln Continental interior.jpg|2017 Lincoln Continental dashboard\nFile:2019 Lincoln Continental \"Select\", rear 10.29.19.jpg|2019 Lincoln Continental, rear view\n</gallery>\n\n=== Trim ===\nIn line with current Lincoln product offerings, the Lincoln Continental is offered in three standard trims, Premiere, Select, and Reserve.

The model line was introduced following the construction of a personal vehicle for [[Edsel Ford]], who commissioned a coachbuilt 1939 Lincoln-Zephyr convertible, developed as a vacation vehicle to attract potential Lincoln buyers. In what would give the model line its name, the exterior was given European \"continental\" styling elements, including a [[Continental tire|rear-mounted spare tire]].\n\nIn production for over 55 years across nine different decades, Lincoln has produced ten generations of the Continental. Within the Lincoln model line, the Continental has served several roles ranging from its flagship to its base-trim sedan. From 1961 to 1976, Lincoln sold the Continental as its exclusive model line.  The model line has also gone on hiatus three times. From 1949 to 1955, the nameplate was briefly retired. In 1981, the Continental was renamed the [[Lincoln Town Car]] to accommodate the 1982 seventh-generation Continental.  After 2002, the Continental was retired, largely replaced by the [[Lincoln MKS]] in 2009; in 2017, the tenth-generation Continental replaced the MKS.\n\nAs part of its entry into full-scale production, the first-generation Continental was the progenitor of an entirely new automotive segment, the [[personal luxury car]].  Following World War II, the segment evolved into coupes and convertibles larger than [[sports car]]s and [[Grand tourer|grand touring cars]] with an emphasis on features, styling, and comfort over performance and handling. From 1956 to 1957, the Continental nameplate was the namesake of the short-lived Continental Division, marketing the 1956\u20131957 [[Continental Mark II]] as the worldwide flagship of Ford Motor Company; as a second successor, Ford introduced the [[Lincoln Mark series |Continental Mark series]] in 1969, produced over six generations to 1998.\n\nAlong with the creation of the personal luxury car segment, the Lincoln Continental marked the zenith of several designs in American automotive history. The Continental is the final American vehicle line with a factory-produced V12 engine (1948), the final four-door convertible (1967), and the final model line to undergo [[Downsize (automobile) |downsizing]] (for the 1980 model year).\n\n==Edsel Ford prototype (1939)==\nThe Lincoln Continental began life as a personal vehicle for Ford Motor Company President Edsel Ford.<ref>Dammann, George ''The Cars of Lincoln Mercury'' (Sarasota, FLA: Crestline, 1987), p. 192.</ref>  In 1938, Ford commissioned a one-off design he wanted ready for his March 1939 vacation from company Chief Stylist  [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie|Eugene T. \"Bob\" Gregorie]]. Using the blueprints of the streamlined [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] as a starting point, Gregorie sketched a design for a convertible with a redesigned body; allegedly, the initial sketch for the design was completed in an hour.\n\nAt the time work had begun on the first Continental coupe, Lincoln had previously cancelled the [[Lincoln K-series]] coupes, sedans, and limousines, and produced the very limited [[Lincoln Custom]] limousine, along with the smaller [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] coupes and sedans. Ford wanted to revive the popularity of the 1929\u20131932 [[Lincoln K-series#1932|Lincoln Victoria]] coupe and convertible but with a more modern approach, reflecting European styling influences for the Continental.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lincoln Series KA Victoria coupe|url=http://www.desertclassics.com/Linc32KAcp.html|website=Desert Classics|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy design, the Edsel Ford prototype could be considered a [[Chopping and channeling|channelled and sectioned]] Lincoln-Zephyr convertible; although the vehicle wore a conventional windshield profile, the prototype sat nearly 7 inches lower than a standard Lincoln. With the massive decrease in height, the [[running board]]s were deleted entirely. In contrast to the Zephyr (and in a massive change from the K-Series Lincoln), the hood sat nearly level with the fenders. To focus on the styling of the car, the chrome trim on the car was largely restricted to the grille; instead of door handles, pushbuttons opened the doors. As with the Lincoln-Zephyr, the prototype was fitted with a 267 cubic-inch V12 engine; it was fitted with front and rear transverse leaf springs and hydraulic drum brakes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1955_Lincoln/1955-Lincoln---The-Continentals-Brochure |title=1955 Lincoln \u2013 The Continentals Brochure |website=Oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=2015-03-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090323/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1955_Lincoln/1955-Lincoln---The-Continentals-Brochure |archivedate=2015-04-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe design would introduce two long-running features used in many American automobile designs. The modified body gave the design new proportions over its Zephyr counterpart; with the hoodline sitting lower over the V12 engine and the passenger compartment moved rearward, the prototype had more in common with classic era \"long-hood, short deck\" body configurations versus being a strict adherent of contemporary [[streamline moderne]] design trends. As a consequence of the smaller trunk space, the spare tire was mounted behind the trunk; while disappearing on American cars, the [[Continental tire|externally mounted, covered spare tire]] remained a feature on European-produced cars.\n\nThe prototype designed by Gregorie was produced on time, making the deadline to be delivered to Edsel Ford in Florida. Interest from well-off friends was high; Edsel sent a telegram back to Michigan that he could sell a thousand of them. In reference to its European-inspired design, the Lincoln-based prototype received its name: Continental.\n\nImmediately, production commenced on the Lincoln Continental, with the majority of production being \"Cabriolet\" convertibles and a rare number of coupes. They were extensively hand-built; the two dozen 1939 models and 400 1940-built examples were built with hand-hammered body panels; dies for machine-pressing were not constructed until 1941. The limited number of 1939 models produced are commonly referred to as '1940 Continentals'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ritch|first=Ocee |title=The Lincoln Continental |publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers & Wholesalers, Inc. |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |year=1963 |page=47}}</ref>\n\n==First generation (1940\u20131948)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = Bonhams - The Paris Sale 2012 - Lincoln Continental Coupe - 1941 - 003.jpg\n| model_years = 1940\u20131948\n| assembly = [[Lincoln Assembly]], [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />2-door [[convertible]]\n| engine = {{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Lincoln-Zephyr V12 engine|Lincoln-Zephyr V12]]\n| related = [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] (1940)<br/>[[Lincoln Zephyr V-12|Lincoln Zephyr]] (1941\u201342)<br />[[Lincoln H-series]] (post-war)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|125.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = 1940\u201341: {{convert|209.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1942\u201348: {{convert|218.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = 1940\u201341: {{convert|75.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1942\u201348: {{convert|77.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"flory2008\">{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J. \"Kelly\"|title=American Cars, 1946\u20131959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}</ref>\n| height = 1940\u201341: {{convert|62.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1942\u201348: {{convert|63.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|4000|-|4300|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer = [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie|Eugene T. \"Bob\" Gregorie]] (1938)<br> [[Raymond Loewy]] (1946 facelift)\n| caption = ''1941 Lincoln Continental coupe''\n}}\n\n[[Image:Lincoln Continental Cabriolet photo-14.JPG|thumb|left|1942 Continental with a Dutch number-plate.

The result was a boxier, somewhat heavier look in keeping with then-current design trends, but perhaps less graceful in retrospect. 1942 production was shortened, following the entry of the United States into World War II; the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] led to the suspension of production of automobiles for civilian use.\n\nAfter World War II, the Lincoln division of Ford returned the Continental to production as a 1946 model; Lincoln dropped the Zephyr nomenclature following the war, so the postwar Continental was derived from the standard Lincoln (internally H-Series). To attract buyers, the design was refreshed with updated trim, distinguished by a new grille. For 1947, walnut wood trim was added to the interior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1947_Lincoln/1947_Lincoln_Folder/1947%20Lincoln-a04.html |title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1947_Lincoln/1947_Lincoln_Folder |website=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Edsel Ford in 1943, Ford Motor Company re-organized its corporate management structure, which led to the 1946 departure of the Continental's designer Bob Gregorie. That year's Continental, the first postwar model, was designed by famed industrial stylist [[Raymond Loewy]]. 1948 would become the last year for the Continental, as the division sought to redevelop its new 1949 model line as an upgraded version of the Mercury; the expensive personal-luxury car no longer had a role at Lincoln.\n\nThe 1939\u20131948 Continental is recognized as a \"Full Classic\" by the [[Classic Car Club of America]], one of the last-built cars to be so recognized.

With a large number of power-equipment features included, the Mark II was offered with only a single option: air conditioning priced at $595.\n\nOn a unique, low-slung chassis sharing its 126-inch wheelbase dimension with the Lincoln Capri and Premiere, the Mark II was assembled with its own body panels and interior; each vehicle was hand-built, with hand-sanding and finishing of body panels. In several elements of its design, the Mark II broke from American styling precedent. As with a Rolls-Royce or [[Mercedes-Benz W189|Mercedes-Benz 300d]], the Mark II essentially restricted chrome trim to the window trim, grille, and bumpers. With a nearly flat hood and trunklid, the Mark II was also designed with neither tailfins (prominent on American sedans) nor [[Ponton (car)|pontoon fenders]] (then current in Europe). Rather than a separate assemblage the \"[[Continental spare tire]]\" was now integrated into the deck lid stamping, serving to accommodate the vertically-mounted spare tire beneath.<ref>{{cite book|title=Classic American Cars|last=Wilson|first=Quentin|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|year=1997|location=New York, NY|page=64}}</ref>\n\nIn total, 2,996 Continental Mark IIs were produced (including two prototype convertibles).<ref name=\":1\">Gunnel, p. 499.</ref>  As a consequence of the nearly hand-built construction, Ford estimated it lost nearly $1000 on every Continental Mark II produced.<ref>{{cite book|title=80 Years of Cadillac La Salle|last=McCall|first=Walter|publisher=Crestline Publishing|year=1982|location=Sarasota FL|page=26}}</ref>  After 1957, the Mark II was discontinued; the Continental Division was re-branded as a competitor to Imperial and Cadillac (rather than Rolls-Royce and Bentley).<gallery>\nFile:Elvis Presley Automobile Museum Memphis TN 2013-03-24 030 1956 Lincoln Continental Mark II.jpg|1956 Continental Mark II, originally owned by [[Elvis Presley]]\nFile:Continental 1957 MarkII LSideFront Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14874759364).jpg|1957 Continental Mark II\nFile:Continental 1957 MarkII RSideRear Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14854220726).jpg|1957 Continental Mark II, showing rear ''[[Continental tire|Continental spare tire]]'' trunklid \nFile:57 Continental Mark II (7810973532).jpg|Continental Division emblem on rear trunklid, 1957 Mark II \nFile:Continental 1956 MarkII HenryFordII cockpit Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14690528548).jpg|Dashboard, 1956 Continental Mark II \nFile:56 Continental Mark II (7810892536).jpg|Exterior view of front seats, 1956 Mark II\nFile:Continental 1956 MarkII HenryFordII engine Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14874156821).jpg|Lincoln 368 cubic-inch [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine|''Y-block'']] V8, 1956 Mark II \n</gallery>\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Lincoln Continental (second generation)}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Third generation (1958\u20131960)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation\n| image = Lincoln Continental Wasen.jpg\n| caption = 1959 Continental Mark IV Landau\n| manufacturer = 1958: Continental Division (Ford)<br>1959\u20131960: Lincoln-Mercury Division (Ford)\n| model_years = 1958\u20131960\n| assembly = United States: [[Wixom, Michigan]] ([[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]])\n| designer = [[John Najjar]]\n| class = [[Luxury vehicle#High-end luxury/full-size luxury cars|Full-size luxury car]] ([[F-segment|F]])\n| body_style = 2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[convertible]]<br />4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br />4-door ''Landau'' [[hardtop]]<br />4-door ''Town Car'' [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br />4-door ''[[Limousine]]''\n| chassis = [[Unibody]]\n| related = [[Lincoln Premiere#1958\u20131960|Lincoln Premiere]]<br/>[[Lincoln Capri#1958\u20131959|Lincoln Capri]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| engine = {{convert|430|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford MEL engine#430|''MEL'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Cruise-O-Matic|''Turbo-Drive'']] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|131.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1959\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1959_Lincoln/1959_Lincoln_Brochure/1959%20Lincoln-17.html |title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1959_Lincoln/1959_Lincoln_Brochure |website=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n| length = 1958: {{convert|229.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958-Lincoln-12|title=1958 Lincoln-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002031123/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958-Lincoln-12|archivedate=2016-10-02}}</ref><br />1959: {{convert|227.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1960: {{convert|227.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = 1958\u201359: {{convert|80.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1960: {{convert|80.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = 1958: {{convert|56.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1959\u20131960: {{convert|56.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|5000|-|5700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n}}\nTo build a better business case for its flagship and the division that marketed the vehicle, the Continental model line underwent extensive changes for the 1958 model year. To widen its sales potential, Ford required Continental to reach a $6000 price (a 40% reduction from the Mark II), allowing the division to better compete against [[Cadillac Eldorado]] and [[Imperial (automobile)#Second generation (1957\u20131966)|Imperial LeBaron]].<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://newfreelifestyle.com/?p=1742|title=LINCOLN CONTINENTAL MARK IV 1960|date=2016-08-27|website=newfreelifestyle.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217223951/http://newfreelifestyle.com/?p=1742|archive-date=17 February 2017|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>  To allow for production at a larger scale, the Continental model line was more closely integrated with Lincoln, differing primarily in roofline, trim, and grille.  For 1959, Ford cancelled the Continental Division outright, with its model line remaining through the 1960 as part of the model cycle. \n\nThe first all-new unibody design since World War II, this generation of the Continental is one of the largest sedans ever built by Ford Motor Company (or any American automaker).<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|date=January 1959|title=Annual Auto Section|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNsDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|journal=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Magazines|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>     \n\n===Development===\nTo facilitate continuation of the Continental model line, the division was forced to abandon hand-built construction. Sharing a common chassis and much of the exterior of the Lincoln Premiere, Continental production shifted to the then-new Wixom Assembly plant.\n\nTo set itself apart from a Lincoln, along with a division-specific grille, all versions of the Continental (including convertibles) were styled with a reverse-slant roofline, fitted with a retractable \"[[Breezeway (car)|breezeway]]\" rear window. First introduced on the 1957 [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser]], the feature allowed for augmented interior ventilation (along with air conditioning). Unlike the Turnpike Cruiser, the reverse slant of the roofline included the rear window, an element that would reappear on Mercury sedans in the next decade. \n\nThe Continental Mark III was designed by [[John Najjar]], Chief Stylist of Lincoln, assisted by [[Elwood Engel]] largely drawing influence from the 1955 Ford La Tosca concept model designed by Alex Tremulis.  Engel would style the 1959 Mark IV, with Don Delarossa (who replaced Najjar as Lincoln Chief Stylist in 1957) developing the 1960 Mark V.<ref name=\":2\" />  As a result of its massive size and the configuration of its headlights, the model line was nicknamed the \"slant-eyed monster\" in the Ford design studio.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n===Chassis/body===\nThe 1958\u20131960 Continental Mark III\u2013V are built upon the same mechanical components utilized by the Lincoln Capri and Premiere.  For 1958, Lincoln split further from Mercury in body design as part of ongoing efforts to outdo Cadillac, with Lincoln adopting unibody construction for the first time;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958-Lincoln-10-11|title=1958 Lincoln-10-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002041759/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958-Lincoln-10-11|archivedate=2016-10-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> the Continental shares a common body with the Premiere, with the exception of the reverse-slant roofline.\n\nShared with Lincoln, Mercury, and the [[Ford Thunderbird (second generation)|Ford Thunderbird]], the Continental Mark III\u2013V were fitted with a 430 cubic-inch [[Ford MEL engine|MEL]] V8 engine; a 3-speed [[Cruise-O-Matic|Turbo-Drive]] automatic was the sole transmission. In 1958, the engine produced 375&nbsp;hp, and was retuned to 350&nbsp;hp in 1959, making 315&nbsp;hp in 1960.\n\nUsing a 131-inch wheelbase, the 1958 Continentals are the longest-wheelbase sedans ever built by Ford Motor Company. Longer than a Ford Excursion, the 1958\u20131960 Continentals are the longest sedans ever produced by Ford without [[5 mph bumper]]s. The 1958 Continental Mark III convertible is the longest convertible ever mass-produced in the United States, with the sole exception of the (extremely rare) 1934\u20131937 [[Cadillac V-16|Cadillac V16]] convertibles.\n\n===Models===\nIn line with the previous Continental naming tradition, Continental introduced its 1958 model line as the Mark III. In a break from previous practice, the two subsequent model years were marketed as incrementally increased \"marks\" (Marks IV and V).\n\n====Mark III (1958)====\nFor 1958, Continental released the Mark III in four bodystyles, including a 2-door hardtop and convertible, a 4-door pillared sedan, and a four-door hardtop sedan (called Landau). Although far less expensive than the Mark II, the Mark III remained well-equipped, retaining air conditioning as an option (relocated from the ceiling to the dashboard).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1957_Lincoln/1957_Lincoln_Brochure/1957%20Lincoln-10-11.html|title=1957 Lincoln Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>  The Mark III became the first Ford Motor Company vehicle to offer an FM radio tuner (as a rarely ordered option).<ref name=\"flory2008\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958%20Lincoln-12.html|title=1958 Lincoln Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>  A unique option was \"Auto Lube\", allowing for the car to lubricate itself (as long as an oil reservoir was kept full).<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1959\" />\n\n====Mark IV (1959)====\nFor 1959, the Continental Mark IV saw a minor restyling, with the elimination of [[Dagmar bumpers|Dagmars]] from the front bumpers and side sculpting becoming much less deeply drawn. Coinciding with the end of the Continental Division, \"Continental III\" fender badging is replaced by separate \"Continental\" and \"Mark IV\" badging. The grille is restyled slightly, with the headlight clusters now integrated into the egg-crate grille.\n\n====Mark V (1960)====\nFor 1960, the Continental Mark V saw another styling update, with flatter front bumpers (with Dagmars). The Continental badging was restyled, with \"Mark V\" badging moved to the rear fenders. On the front fenders, several horizontal chrome strakes were added. Using a similar layout as the Mark IV, the Mark V was given a restyled grille.\n\n====Town Car/Limousine====\nAlongside the Mark III, IV, and V, there are two additional models of the third-generation Continental. In 1959, Lincoln added the Limousine and Town Car bodystyles; the latter marked the first use of the Town Car name by Lincoln. Available only in black, both versions were built with a model-specific formal rear roofline with a padded roof; the Limousine featured a partition between the front and rear seats. The roofline of Town Car and Limousine was designed in an effort to avoid extending the wheelbase; the deletion of the reverse-slant rear window allowed for the rear seat to be moved rearward several inches.\n\nThe 1959\u20131960 Town Car and Limousine are among the rarest Lincoln vehicles ever sold; only 214 examples of the $9,200 Town Car were produced and only 83 examples of the $10,200 Limousine were produced.<ref name=\":2\" />\n<gallery>\nFile:Continental Mk.

From 1958 to 1960, the Lincoln Division would lose over $60 million; along with the launch of newly developed vehicles in a recession economy (a factor that contributed to the downfall of the Edsel line), Lincoln and Continental was faced with overcoming the expense of developing a vehicle that was shared with neither Ford nor Mercury.\n\nIn 1961, as Lincoln redesigned its model line, the Continental went from being the flagship Lincoln to the only model line sold by the division (for the next 16 years). In the mid-1960s, Ford made a decision to develop a new successor to the Mark II, naming it the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III, effectively beginning the]] [[Lincoln Mark series|Mark series]]. As with the Mark II and the 1958-1960 Continentals, it was sold, marketed, and serviced by Lincoln, though not officially badged as such.

This was extended to 126 inches from 1964 to 1969.\n\nThe only engine available was the {{convert|430|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford MEL engine#430|MEL V8]] carried over from the Mark V. It was expanded to [[Ford MEL engine#462|462]] cubic inches in 1966, becoming the largest-displacement engine ever used in a Ford Motor Company passenger car. A new engine, the {{convert|460|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford 385 engine|''385-series'']]-based V8, took its place in 1969, shared with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]]. All versions of the Continental were fitted with a 3-speed automatic transmission.  New for 1966 was Ford's C6 automatic, designed for use in big block, high-horsepower V8 engines.\n\n===Body===\nAt its 1961 launch, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental was offered solely as a four-door, as either a sedan or a convertible. For the first time on a Lincoln since 1951, rear doors were rear-hinged ([[suicide door]]s). To alert drivers of open doors, Lincoln fitted the dashboard with a \"Door Ajar\" warning light (as seen on many modern automobiles). Latching together at the B-pillar with a vacuum-operated central locking system, convertibles used an abbreviated pillar while sedans were \"pillared hardtops\". In the configuration, a thin B-pillar supported the roof structure while all four doors utilized frameless door glass (in the style of a hardtop or convertible); the layout would become used by several Ford Motor Company sedans during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn what would be the first four-door convertible from a major American manufacturer after World War II, the Lincoln Continental convertible was fitted with a power-operated top on all examples. Deriving its mechanism from the [[Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner]] hardtop convertible, the Continental was fitted with a fabric roof that stored under a rear-hinged deck lid/filler panel. In a similar fashion as the Skyliner, to access the trunk for storage, the deck lid was opened electrically (without raising or lowering the roof).\n\nA somewhat rare and unusual option for 1964\u20131965 was the vertically adjustable steering column. Unlike most tilt-adjustable columns that employ a lever-activated locking pivot joint just behind the steering wheel the Lincoln version employed a vacuum-actuated clamp, a dash-mounted height indicator window and a pivot point much further down the column.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Ford Swing-Away, Tilt-Away, and Tilt Steering Wheels|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/tbird1961swingaway.html|website=Automotive Mileposts|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:1960s Lincoln Continental convertible with suicide doors open.jpg|Lincoln Continental\nFile:1961 Lincoln Continental Convertible (20907384860).jpg|Lincoln Continental convertible \nFile:66Continental.jpg|Lincoln Continental convertible\n</gallery>\n\n===Model timeline===\nDuring its production, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental would be produced in three versions, undergoing model revisions in 1964 and 1966.\n\n===1961\u20131963===\nThe 1961 Lincoln Continental was introduced with four-door sedan and four-door convertible versions, replacing the Lincoln Premiere and Lincoln Continental Mark V.

The front seatbacks were modified in an effort to increase rear seat legroom. To increase luggage space, the trunklid was reshaped. In line with a number of vehicles in the United States, the electrical charging system introduced an [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]], replacing the [[Dynamo|generator]].\n<gallery>\nFile:1961 Lincoln Continental Sedan.jpg|1961 Lincoln Continental sedan \nFile:1962 Lincoln Continental convertible (6263500306).jpg|1962 Lincoln Continental convertible (Australian right-hand drive)\nFile:1962 Lincoln Continental convertible (6262975751).jpg|1962 Lincoln Continental convertible\nFile:1962 Lincoln Continental convertible (6263496568).jpg|1962 Lincoln Continental convertible (Australian right-hand drive)\nFile:1963 Lincoln Continental Sedan.jpg|1963 Lincoln Continental\n</gallery>\n\n===1964\u20131965===\nFor 1964, the Lincoln Continental underwent its first mid-cycle redesign. Alongside styling updates, several functional changes were focused towards increasing rear-seat space. The wheelbase was increased from 123 to 126 inches, shifting the rear seats backward.   The roofline underwent several changes, with the adoption of flat side glass (replacing curved window glass). To increase rear headroom, the rear roofline became additionally squared off, in a notchback style.\n\nIn a slight exterior restyling, to eliminate the \"electric shaver\" appearance, the front fascia added vertical chrome accents to the grille; the recessed rear grille was replaced by a much simpler decklid with trim panel (moving the fuel-filler door to the left-rear fender). The interior was completely revised with a full-width instrument panel, updated upholstery patterns, door panels and fittings.\n\nIn 1964, Lincoln debuted the Continental Town Brougham concept car,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/lincoln/lincoln1964townbroughamshowcar.html|title=1964 Lincoln Continental Town Brougham Show Car \u2013 AUTOMOTIVE MILEPOSTS|publisher=}}</ref> which had a 131 in. wheelbase, overall length at 221.3, and had a retractable glass partition between the front and rear compartments, with an exposed area over the front compartment, in typical 1930s style [[town car]]/[[Brougham (car body)|brougham]] appearance.\n\nFor 1965, Lincoln made additional updates to the Continental. In a styling change, the convex \"electric shaver\" front fascia was replaced by a more angular blunt hood with an upright flat grille design. As part of the redesign, the front turn signals and parking lights are moved from the front bumpers to wraparound lenses on the front fenders, with similar parking lights/turn signals on the rear; all four lights received metal trim to match the horizontal lines of the new grille. To improve braking ability, the Continental was given Kelsey-Hayes [[disc brake]]s for the front wheels; in addition, front seat belts with retractors became standard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1965_Lincoln/1965_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure/1965%20Lincoln%20Continental-14%20001.html |title=1965 Lincoln Continental Brochure |website=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:1964 Lincoln Continental (28446300583).jpg|1964 Lincoln Continental sedan\nFile:1964 Lincoln Continental (28446257193).jpg|1964 Lincoln Continental sedan, rear\nFile:1964 Lincoln Continental (29064050575).jpg|1964 Lincoln Continental sedan, interior\nFile:1965 Lincoln Continental Convertible (9347201253).jpg|1965 Lincoln Continental convertible\nFile:1965 Lincoln Continental Sedan.jpg|1965 Lincoln Continental sedan \n</gallery>\n\n===1966\u20131969===\n[[File:Royal motorcade (8075978363).jpg|thumb|right|[[British royal family]] in 1967 Continental]]\nFor 1966, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental underwent a second mid-cycle redesign. To better compete against the [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville]] and the [[Imperial (automobile)#1966|Imperial Crown Coupe]], Lincoln introduced its first two-door pillarless hardtop since 1960. The convertible remained offered solely as a four-door. In an effort to increase sales of the five year-old model range, Lincoln reduced the price of the Continental nearly $600 from 1965 while keeping equipment levels identical.<ref>Flory, p. 454.</ref>  The marketing decision proved successful; boosted by the introduction of the two-door body style, the model range increased sales by 36%.<ref name=\"Flory, p.456\">Flory, p. 456.</ref>\n\nWhile following much of the 1965 restyling (distinguished largely by a new grille and the addition of \"Continental\" to the hood), the 1966 Lincoln Continental wore an all new body, growing 5 inches longer (implemented primarily in the rear seats to accommodate more leg room), and nearly an inch taller and wider. Curved side glass made its return (with less obvious [[tumblehome]], to increase interior room). To offer an engine sized comparably to those in the Imperial (440 cubic inches in 1966) and Cadillac (429 cubic inches, 472 cubic inches in 1968), the 430 V8 was enlarged to 462 cubic inches.\n\nThe convertible underwent several equipment revisions for the first time, adding a glass rear window and the top mechanism added a second hydraulic pump for opening the convertible roof and the trunklid (making the two systems separate); hydraulic solenoids were deleted from the top mechanism. The interior underwent several revisions, adding a tilt steering wheel and an 8-track tape player as options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1966_Lincoln/1966_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure/1966%20Lincoln%20Continental-16.html|title=1966 Lincoln Continental Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n\nFor 1967, the Lincoln Continental was given only minor trim updates, with the deletion of the Lincoln star emblem from the front fenders being the largest change. Several functional changes were made, as Lincoln added a number of indicator lights to the dashboard. Along with an oil pressure warning light, the dashboard was given indicator lights for an open trunk and the cruise control (if on).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1967_Lincoln/1967_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure/1967%20Continental-18.html|title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1967_Lincoln/1967_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure|work=oldcarbrochures.com}}</ref>  Following federal safety mandates, lap safety seatbelts became standard equipment, coupled with an energy-absorbing steering column.\n\nFollowing years of decreasing sales, 1967 marked the final year of the Lincoln Continental convertible, with only 2,276 sold.<ref>Flory, p. 529.</ref><ref name=\"Flory, p.530\">Flory, p. 530.</ref>  After becoming the first four-door convertible sold after World War II, the Lincoln Continental would become the final (as of the 2018 model year) example of its type sold by an American manufacturer. As a result of numerous frame reinforcements (in comparison to the sedan), the 5,712 pound 1967 Lincoln Continental convertible is one of the heaviest passenger cars ever sold by Ford Motor Company.<ref>Gunnell, p. 132.</ref>\n\nFor 1968, several updates were made to the Continental, primarily in response to federal safety mandates. To meet requirements for side marker lights, wraparound lenses were returned to the fenders; the front turn signals were styled similar to the Continental Mark III. The \"Continental\" wording was removed from the front fascia, replaced by the Lincoln star emblem (as seen on the rear); the hood ornament was deleted, in anticipation of a federal ban on the feature (which never came to effect). For the interior, torso seatbelts were added for the outboard front seats.\n\nIntended as a 1968 introduction, the all-new 460 cubic-inch [[Ford 385 engine|385-series/Lima]] V8 was shared with the Mark III, introduced as an early 1969 model.<ref name=\":5\">Flory, pp. 603 & 679.</ref>  However, the supply of 462 engines was sufficient to last through most of the model year, pushing the introduction of the 460 in the Continental towards the end of the model year.<ref name=\":6\">''Cars of the Sizzling '60s'', p. 348.</ref>\n\nFor 1968, Lincoln made several styling changes to the Continental. To meet federal safety standards, the parking lights, taillights, and front turn signals were returned to a wraparound design on the fenders to satisfy Federal standards for side marker lights. For the outboard front seats, shoulder seatbelts were added. The new {{convert|460|cid|l|abbr=on}} [[Ford 385 engine]] was to be available at the beginning of the model year, but there were so many {{convert|462|cid|l|abbr=on}} [[Ford MEL engine]] engines still available, the 460 was phased in later that year.<ref name=\":6\" /> In April, the new [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Mark III]] made its debut, as a 1969 model.<ref name=\":5\" /> Total sales would be down to just 39,134.<ref name=\":7\">Flory, p. 605.</ref>\n\nFor 1969, few changes were made in the final year of production. To comply with federal regulations, the front seats were updated with [[head restraint]]s for the outboard passengers.<ref>''Ibid''., p.393.</ref>  The front fascia was updated, with the grille enlarged for the first time since 1965, with the \"Continental\" wording returning above the grille. Shared with the Mark III, the 460 V8 became the sole engine for the Lincoln Continental, paired with the Ford C6 3-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAfter a nine-year hiatus, the Town Car name made a return in 1969 as part of an interior trim option package for the Continental.\n<gallery>\nFile:1966 Lincoln Continental (2388878850).jpg|1966 Lincoln Continental sedan\nFile:Light blue Continental p1.JPG|1966 Lincoln Continental convertible \nFile:1967 Lincoln Continental coupe (8451927672).jpg|1967 Lincoln Continental two-door hardtop\nFile:Lincoln Continental Front.jpg|1967 Lincoln Continental four-door sedan \nFile:Lincoln Continental Heck.jpg|1967 Lincoln Continental four-door sedan, rear view\nFile:1968 Lincoln Continental (24408734302).jpg|1968 Lincoln Continental four-door sedan\nFile:1968 Lincoln Continental (24490799876).jpg|1968 Lincoln Continental sedan, rear view \nFile:1969 Lincoln Continental coupe (6880507298).jpg|1969 Lincoln Continental hardtop coupe\nFile:1969 Lincoln Continental (16369774371).jpg|1969 Lincoln Continental four-door\n</gallery>\n\n=== Presidential state cars ===\n[[File:President John F.

Building on the success of the Mark III introduced the year before, Lincoln sought to modernize the Continental for the 1970s after a nine-year production run.\n\nAlthough shorter in wheelbase and slightly narrower than 1958\u20131960 Lincolns, the addition of 5-mph bumpers make 1977\u20131979 Lincolns the longest automobiles ever produced by Ford Motor Company.\n\n===Chassis===\nThe fifth-generation Lincoln Continental is based on body-on-frame construction, the first Lincoln to do so since 1957. To save on its engineering and development costs, the Continental was no longer given its own chassis, instead given a longer-wheelbase version of the Mercury Marquis chassis (stretched from 124 inches to 127 inches; 1974\u20131979 vehicles received a 127.2-inch wheelbase).\n\nShared with the LTD and Marquis, the Continental was equipped with coil springs at all four corners. From 1970 to 1974, the Continental was fitted with front disc and rear drum brakes;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1970_Lincoln/1970%20Lincoln%20Continental%20Brochure/1970%20Lincoln%20Continental-07.html|title=1970 Lincoln Continental Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref> from 1975 to 1979, four-wheel disc brakes were available.<ref name=\":8\">Dammann, p. 492.</ref>\n\nThe 460 cubic-inch V8 returned as the standard engine, becoming available from 1970 to 1977; from 1970 to 1972, the 460 remained exclusive to Lincoln. In an effort to increase fuel economy and comply with emissions standards, Lincoln added a 400 cubic-inch V8 for California for 1977, with the 460 remaining available in 49 states. For 1978, the 400 became standard (with the 460 as an option), with the 460 discontinued for 1979. Both engines were paired with the Ford C6 3-speed automatic transmission.\n\n===Body===\nIn a major departure from its fourth-generation predecessor, the 1970 Lincoln Continental's Marquis-based frame forced the sedan to abandon \"suicide doors\" for conventional front-hinged doors. As with its predecessor and the Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was offered as a two-door hardtop and as a four-door \"pillared hardtop\" sedan (B-pillar with frameless door glass). Unlike Ford or Mercury, no Lincoln two-door convertible was introduced.\n\nShared with the Mark series, the fifth-generation Continental was equipped with vacuum-operated [[hidden headlamp]]s; as a fail-safe, the headlamp doors were designed to open in the event of failure (a dashboard indicator light indicated their status).<ref name=\"1970Brochure\" />\n\n===Model timeline===\nDuring its production, the fifth-generation Lincoln Continental was sold in two versions, with a major revision in 1975. Following the downsizing of the full-size General Motors and Chrysler product lines, the Lincoln Continental became the largest mass-market automobile produced worldwide for the 1977 model year. It was surpassed only by purpose-built limousines such as the long-wheelbase version of the Mercedes-Benz [[Mercedes-Benz 600|600]], the Rolls-Royce [[Rolls-Royce Phantom VI|Phantom VI]], and the [[ZIL-4104]]. Following the 1979 downsizing of the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was marketed as the final \"traditional\" or \"large\" sedan in the United States.\n\n===1970\u20131974===\nFor 1970, Lincoln introduced a redesigned Continental two-door, Continental four-door, and Continental Town Car; sold only as a four-door, the Town Car was distinguished by a vinyl roof.\n\nFor 1971, the grille underwent a minor styling change, partially in an effort to better distinguish the Continental from the Mercury Marquis. The grille and headlight doors were redesigned, with the latter painted in body color. Rear-wheel ABS brakes (called Sure-Trak) was optional.<ref>{{cite book |title=1971 Lincoln Continental & Mark III |publisher=The Ford Motor Company |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---June/1971-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-III-Brochure-Cdn/1971-Continental-Mark-III-Cdn--08-09 |access-date=2018-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140112/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---June/1971-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-III-Brochure-Cdn/1971-Continental-Mark-III-Cdn--08-09 |archive-date=2018-06-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor 1972, several functional changes were made, as the 460 V8 decreased in compression; though intended to decrease emissions and adapt to unleaded gasoline, output dropped. The tradition of Lincoln-exclusive engines came to an end, as Mercury began use of the 460 in the Mercury Marquis and Colony Park as an option. Minor styling changes were made, as the grille and the fenders were restyled; to better separate the Continental from the Mark IV, Lincoln reintroduced chrome fender trim. For the first time since 1967, the Continental was equipped with a hood ornament. On the inside, more rear seat legroom was added.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---December/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mk-VI-Brochure/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-IV-02 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220124222/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---December/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mk-VI-Brochure/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-IV-02 |archivedate=2016-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nFor 1973, the Lincoln Continental was brought into compliance with federal crash regulations as it was fitted with a 5-mph front bumper. While a number of vehicles underwent significant revisions to comply with the regulation, the Continental was able to meet the standard by moving its front bumper several inches forward and fitting it with rubber-tipped impact overriders. The rear bumper was modified in a similar manner, with a 2 1/2&nbsp;mph rating; in total, the Continental gained nearly 5 inches in length.\n\nAs a counterpart to the Continental Town Car, a two-door Continental Town Coupe was introduced. In a similar fashion as the Town Car, the Town Coupe was distinguished by its padded vinyl top.\n\nFor 1974, the Lincoln Continental was given a new grille, moving from an egg-crate style to a waterfall design. As part of federal regulations, a 5-mph bumper was added to the rear, leading to a redesign of the rear bumper; the taillamps were moved from inside the bumper to above it.\n<gallery>\nFile:Lincoln Continental (13241720114).jpg|1970 Lincoln Continental\nFile:Lincoln Continental (13241540833).jpg|1970 Lincoln Continental, rear view\nFile:1972 Lincoln Continental 1.jpg|1972 Lincoln Continental \nFile:1972 Lincoln Continental rear.jpg|1972 Lincoln Continental, rear view \nFile:1973 Lincoln Continental Town Car sedan (12404237654).jpg|1973 Lincoln Continental Town Car\nFile:1973 Lincoln Continental brown with white roof.jpg|1973 Lincoln Continental coupe\nFile:'74 Lincoln Continental Town Car (Auto classique VAQ Beaconsfield '13).JPG|1974 Lincoln Continental Town Car \n</gallery>\n\n===1975\u20131979===\nAfter 5 years on the market, Lincoln made an extensive revision to the Continental. Coinciding with the 1975 introduction of the [[Mercury Grand Marquis]], Lincoln and Mercury sought to better visually differentiate their two flagship model lines, in spite of their mechanical commonality. As part of the revision, the Lincoln Continental was able to adopt a greater degree of styling commonality with the Continental Mark IV. For 1975, the exterior of the Lincoln Continental underwent a major revision. Although the body below the beltline saw only minor change with the taillights redesigned with vertical  units, the roofline was completely restyled. To separate itself from the Mark IV, the two-door Continental/Town Coupe adopted a fully pillared roofline with a square opera window in the C-pillar. In place of the pillared hardtop shared with the Mercury Marquis and Ford LTD, the four-door Continental/Town Car adopted a wide B-pillar; to distinguish itself from the [[Cadillac Sixty Special#1971\u20131976|Cadillac Sixty Special Brougham]]; Town Cars were given the oval opera window introduced on the Mark IV. Along with the styling upgrades, 1975 Lincolns received substantial upgrades to the braking system. Designed by [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]],<ref name=\":8\" /> the Lincoln Continental became one of the first American cars equipped with a 4-wheel disc brake system (as an option). To further improve the emissions performance of the 460 V8, the engine was fitted with catalytic converters, ending its compatibility with leaded regular gasoline.\n\nFor 1976, the exterior remained essentially the same as the year before (marking the first carryover styling year for Lincoln since 1963). In an effort to price the Continental more competitively, Lincoln deleted a number of previously-standard features, making them extra cost options.\n\nFor 1977, the Lincoln Continental would undergo another exterior revision. The wide Mercury-style grille was replaced by a narrower Rolls-Royce radiator-style grille, nearly identical to the Mark V (variations of the radiator grille would remain in use on Lincolns through 1997). In another trim revision, the \"Continental\" script was removed from the rear fenders.\n\nFor 1978, the dashboard was updated for the first time, as the Lincoln Continental adopted a revised version of the Mercury Grand Marquis dashboard. In addition to increasing parts commonality, the update was done to save weight; the plastic-frame Mercury dashboard was lighter than the previous steel-frame version. In a similar move, Lincoln redesigned the rear fender skirts, adopting a version that covered less of the rear wheels. Alongside the optional sliding glass sunroof, a fixed glass moonroof with an interior sunshade was introduced (for the first time since the [[Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria Skyliner|1955 Ford Skyliner]]).<ref>http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/lincoln/78lin/bilder/11.jpg</ref>\n\nFor 1979, the interior underwent further updating, as the Mercury-sourced dashboard received additional wood trim. The 460 V8 was deleted from the Lincoln/ Mark V model line entirely, leaving the 400 V8 as the sole engine.\n<gallery>\nFile:'75 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe (Rassemblement Rigaud '13).jpg|1975 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe \nFile:Lincoln Continental (1972), Dutch licence registration 42-YA-61 pic1.JPG|1975-1976 Lincoln Continental Town Car\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Town Car sedan (8453059332).jpg|1977 Lincoln Continental Town Car\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Town Car sedan (8453062686).jpg|1977 Lincoln Continental Town Car, rear view \nFile:Lincoln Continental (10098586186).jpg|1978 Lincoln Continental (standard trim)\nFile:1978 Lincoln Continental Coupe (6) (3436151487).jpg|1978 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe, showing glass moonroof\nFile:1978 Lincoln Continental Coupe (27) (4417815333).jpg|1978 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe interior \nFile:Opera window of '79 Town Car.jpg|Opera window, 1979 Lincoln Continental Town Car\n</gallery>\n\n===Special editions===\nThroughout its production, the fifth-generation Lincoln Continental was offered with several special-edition option packages. In contrast to the Mark series, the fifth-generation Continental was not offered with any Designer Series editions.\n\n====Golden Anniversary (1971)====\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of Lincoln in 1971, a ''Golden Anniversary Town Car'' was offered as a limited-edition option package for the Lincoln Continental. Although technically available in any of 25 paint colors available for any Lincoln, the Golden Anniversary Town Car featured an exclusive gold moondust metallic paint color as an option; 1,040 examples were painted in the gold moondust color.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/lincoln/lincoln1971goldenanniversary.html|title=1971 Lincoln Continental Golden Anniversary Town Car|website=automotivemileposts.com|access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref>  All examples were given a color-keyed vinyl roof with a color-keyed leather interior (with trim exclusive to the package).<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nOther features included a commemorative brochure, a glove compartment vanity mirror, a commemorative plaque on the dashboard, and keys plated in 22 carat gold presented in a jewelry box.<ref name=\":9\" />  In total, 1,575 examples were produced; initial production was 1,500 vehicles, with an additional 75 produced exclusively for employees within Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n====Williamsburg Edition (1977\u20131979)====\nFrom 1977 to 1979, Lincoln sold a ''Williamsburg Edition'' Continental Town Car. Intended as a cosmetic option package, the Williamsburg Edition was the only Continental or Town Car sold with two-tone paint;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/contentslincoln.shtml|title=1952-1979 Lincoln and Lincoln Continental {{!}} AUTOMOTIVE MILEPOSTS|website=automotivemileposts.com|access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref> the edition also standardized a number of options. Along with two-tone paint, the Williamsburg Edition also included a full vinyl roof, pinstriping, power vent windows, lighted vanity mirrors, and 6-way twin \"Comfort Lounge Seats\".\n\nFor 1977, the option package was designed as one of the most conservative versions of the Town Car, without any opera windows or coach lights fitted to the roofline. For 1978 and 1979, the opera windows and coach lights were added to the roofline.\n\n==== Collector's Series (1979) ====\nTo commemorate the end of production of the Lincoln Continental and Continental Mark V while denoting them as the final \"traditional\" full-size American sedans and coupes, Lincoln offered a ''Collector's Series'' for both the Continental and Mark V. As with its Mark V counterpart, the Continental Collector's Series was equipped with essentially every available feature as standard equipment. Only four options were available for the Collector's Series: a power moonroof, 40-channel CB radio, \"Sure-Track\" [[anti-lock brakes]], and a plush Kashmir velour interior (in lieu of leather). The Continental Collector's Series could reach $18,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|18000|1979}}}} in current dollars) when fully equipped; within Ford Motor Company, it was only surpassed by its $22,000 Mark V Collector's Series counterpart at the time.\n\nAlong with four options, the Continental Collector's Series was produced in four colors: dark blue, white and limited-issue medium blue (197 built) and light silver (125 built) with a dark-blue vinyl top.\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Lincoln Continental (fifth generation)}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Sixth generation (1980)==\n{{See also|Lincoln Town Car|Lincoln Continental Mark VI}}\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Sixth generation\n|image = 1980 Lincoln Continental Coupe, front right (Hershey 2019).jpg\n|caption = 1980 Lincoln Continental Coupe\n|interiorcaption = \n|manufacturer = [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln-Mercury]] ([[Ford Motor Company|Ford]])\n|aka = Lincoln Continental Town Car/Town Coupe\n|model_years = 1980\n|assembly = United States: [[Wixom, Michigan]] ([[Wixom Assembly]])\n|factory = [[Wixom Assembly]]\n|class = [[Luxury vehicle#High-end luxury/full-size luxury cars|Full-size luxury sedan]]\n|body_style = 2-door coupe<br>4-door sedan\n|platform = [[Ford Panther platform|Ford Panther]]\n|chassis = body-on-frame\n|related = [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD Landau]]<br>[[Mercury Grand Marquis]]\n|layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n|engine = Ford ''[[Ford 302 engine|5.0L small block]]'' V8\n|transmission = 4-speed ''[[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]]'' overdrive automatic\n|wheelbase = {{convert|117.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = {{convert|219.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{convert|78.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|56.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4061|-|4147|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|successor = [[Lincoln Town Car]]\n}}With the impending adoption of federal fuel-economy standards ([[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]]) making the large cars of the 1970s a potential financial threat to Ford Motor Company, the full-size cars of all of its divisions underwent extensive downsizing for the 1979 model year. For various reasons, delays pushed the release of the downsized Lincoln model lineup into 1980, three years after the downsizing of its Cadillac counterparts. The downsizing undergone by the 1980 Continental and Mark VI provided Lincoln with the best year-to-year fuel economy improvement (38%) in Ford history.<ref>Dammann, p. 528.</ref> The introduction of a standard overdrive transmission enabled the division to leap its competitors, going from the company with the worst [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]] rating to the most fuel-efficient full-size car sold.\n\nOne of the most touted options the 1980 Continental offered was the new digital instrument cluster, which used vacuum fluorescent displays for the vehicle speedometer, odometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gauge. However, the biggest feature was the included \"trip computer\" that showed the driver \"miles to empty\" and (based on driver input) an \"estimated time of arrival\", as well as real-time average fuel economy figures. The digital instrument cluster with the trip computer, along with the engine's new standard electronic fuel injection, 4-speed AOD transmission, power steering and suspension advances, and the new EEC III engine management system allowed the 1980 Lincoln Continental to gain a major technological advantage over its competition; instead of being just a mere redesign and downsize of the 1979 models, the 1980 Continentals would be some of the most advanced vehicles ever sold by Ford up to that point.\n\nThis version of the Continental would last only for a single model year. To eliminate saturation of the Lincoln model line, the car was re-released as the [[Lincoln Town Car]] for 1981, while the Continental name would move to the midsize segment as an early 1982 model. While not officially announced as the replacement for the Versailles, the 1982 Continental would become the Lincoln competitor for the Cadillac Seville. After the end of its model cycle, the Continental Mark VI was replaced by the Mark VII, a far different vehicle.\n\n===Chassis===\nCentral to the redesign was the adoption of the all-new [[Ford Panther platform]], shared with the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis. While retaining the body-on-frame layout of its predecessor and using a rear-wheel drive powertrain, the Panther platform made major engineering changes to lower curb weight. In addition, the chassis itself was smaller in several key dimensions. While only approximately 2 inches narrower, the 1980 Continental shed 10 inches of its wheelbase and 14 inches in length. In losing nearly 1000 pounds of curb weight, the 1980 Continental came within 200 pounds of the curb weight of the \"compact\" Lincoln Versailles.\n\nIn its focus on fuel economy, the Panther platform was developed without the use of the 400 or 460 V8s powering full-size Lincoln-Mercurys throughout the 1970s. In their place was the first fuel-injected V8 engine produced by Ford Motor Company. Based on the 302 cubic-inch small block V8, the newly christened 129&nbsp;hp 5.0L V8 (rounded up from its true 4.9L displacement) was the first \"metric-displacement\" American Ford engine. As an option, a 140&nbsp;hp carbureted 351 cubic-inch Windsor V8 was available. In place of the C6 3-speed automatic transmission was an all-new 4-speed Automatic Overdrive Transmission ([[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]]). Developed under the name Ford Integral Overdrive (FIOD), this industry-first transmission featured both a mechanically-engaged [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] (0.67/1 ratio) fourth gear and third and fourth-gear [[torque converter]] lock-up.\n\nThe new Panther platform allowed for changes in the new Continental's suspension geometry and many improvements were made to the power steering. With this, and the reduced overall size, the 1980 Lincoln Continental was able to retain the traditional big car ride and feel, while offering a major enhancement to its handling. Compared to the 1980 Continental's GM and Chrysler counterparts and the 1979 Lincoln models, the new car offered more agile maneuvering, as well as a reduced turn diameter by over 8 feet (compared to the 1979 Lincoln Continental).\n\n===Body===\nAlthough sharing a common platform and powertrain with the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was well differentiated from its counterparts; no visible body panels were common between the three vehicles. In contrast, the 1980 Continental was positioned as the base model of the Lincoln model line; the Continental Town Car/Town Coupe made its return as the top-trim model. As all Continentals wore padded roofs, Continental Town Cars were largely differentiated by two-tone paint. Lincolns were differentiated from Continental Mark VIs by their exposed headlights and full-width taillamps (instead of a \"Continental spare tire trunk\"). Two-door Lincolns can be distinguished from Mark VI two-doors with their \"notchback\" roofline; they share a common wheelbase with four-door Lincolns. {{Clear}}\n\n==Seventh generation (1982\u20131987)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Seventh generation\n| image = 82LincolnContinental.jpg\n| caption = 1982 Lincoln Continental Givenchy Edition\n| model_years = 1982\u20131987\n| assembly = United States: [[Wixom, Michigan]] ([[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]])\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| platform = [[Ford Fox platform]]\n| related = [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Lincoln Mark VII]]<br />[[Ford Thunderbird (eighth generation)|Ford Thunderbird (1980\u20131982)]]<br />[[Mercury Cougar#1980-1982|Mercury Cougar XR7 (1980\u20131982)]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| engine = {{convert|149|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[BMW M21]]'' [[turbodiesel]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br/>{{convert|232|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)#232|''Essex'']] [[V6]]<br/>{{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Ford 302 engine|''5.0L small block'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Ford AOD transmission|''AOD'']] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br/>4-speed [[ZF 4HP22 transmission|ZF 4HP22]] automatic (turbodiesel)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|108.5|-|108.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|200.7|-|201.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|73.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|55.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|3384|-|3706|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n| predecessor = [[Lincoln Versailles]]\n| image_caption = 1982 Lincoln Continental\n}}\nFollowing the downsizing and adoption of the Panther platform for the 1980 model year, the Lincoln division was faced with a critical issue. After the discontinuation of the compact [[Lincoln Versailles]] early in 1980, Lincoln was left with two full-size sedans. Although each was brand-new for the model year, the Lincoln Continental and Continental Mark VI were functionally identical vehicles. Aside from the \"Continental tire\" trunklid, unique rear quarter panels, different taillamps and [[hidden headlamp]]s of the Mark VI, the two vehicles offered little differentiation.\n\nThe Lincoln Continental made its return in early 1981 as a 1982 model. To further separate Continental from the Town Car, Lincoln designers shifted the Continental nameplate into the mid-size segment. Only offered as a four-door sedan, the Continental was styled with a \"bustle-back\" rear end and marketed to compete directly with the [[Cadillac Seville]] and the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]. Using the lessons learned from Lincoln Versailles and [[badge engineering]], Lincoln stylists took great care to differentiate the expensive Continental from the Ford Granada and Mercury Cougar sedans sharing the [[Ford Fox platform]] with it; unlike the Versailles, no visible body panels were shared. The Continental shared its wheelbase and powertrain with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Continental Mark VII]] introduced for the 1984 model year.\n\nBeginning with the 1981 model year, all manufacturers were required to use a 17 character VIN-code. The first three digits is the [[Vehicle identification number|World Manufacturer Identifier]] which gives the make of the car. 1982\u20131985 Continental 4-door sedans have the separate VIN-code 1MR which designates Continental as the make instead of 1LN as Lincoln (as is the Town Car).\nIn 1986, the situation was clarified by Ford Motor Company as the Continental was reassigned the 1LN VIN-code to designate Lincoln as the make.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cars Of Lincoln-Mercury|last=Dammann, George H.|first=Wagner, James K.|publisher=Crestline Publishing Co.|year=1987|isbn=978-0912612263|location=Sarasota, Florida|pages=414, 545, 577, 582, 583}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=List of manufacturers of motor vehicles and their trailers - numerical - SV 3.2 |url=https://www.kba.de/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/SV/sv32_pdf_en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=6 |publisher=Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt |location=Germany |date=2018-01-15 |access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref>\n\n===Chassis===\nShifting from the Ford Panther platform to the [[Ford Fox platform]], the Lincoln Continental became a mid-size car for the first time. In its redesign, the Continental would lose nearly 9 inches in wheelbase and 18 inches in length, along with over 400 pounds of weight. Although it would be the shortest-wheelbase Lincoln ever (at the time), the Continental would use a stretched 108.5\" wheelbase version of the Fox platform used by the [[Ford Thunderbird (eighth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] and [[Mercury Cougar]]. In marked contrast to its Cadillac Seville competitor, which switched to a front-wheel drive GM platform, the Continental retained the use of rear-wheel drive.\n\nThe 1982 Lincoln Continental was fitted with two different engines. The standard engine was a 131&nbsp;hp carbureted version of the 5.0L V8. At no cost, a 3.8L V6 (shared with the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar<ref>Flammang, p. 603.</ref>) was an option; it was the first non-V8 Lincoln since 1948. Both engines were discontinued for the 1983 model year, replaced by the fuel-injected 5.0L V8 from the Town Car. All three engines were fitted with the 4-speed [[Ford AOD transmission|Ford AOD overdrive transmission]]. As a response to the diesel engine options available in Cadillacs and a number of European luxury brands, Lincoln introduced an optional 114-hp 2.4L turbodiesel inline-6 sourced from BMW (with a ZF 4-speed automatic transmission) for 1984. WIth only 1,500 sold, the diesel-powered Continental was rarely ordered and discontinued after the 1985 model year. The seventh-generation introduced two features as industry firsts: gas-charged shock absorbers and self-sealing tires.\n\n=== Body ===\n[[File:Lincoln Continental (Auto classique St-Bruno-De-Montarville VAQ '13).JPG|left|thumb|1984\u20131987 Lincoln Continental]]\n[[File:Lincoln Continental (4282952655).jpg|left|thumb|1986\u20131987 Lincoln Continental]]\nFor the first time on a Lincoln-badged Continental, its namesake \"Continental spare tire trunk\" seen on the Mark Series was used as a decklid design feature. In addition, the decklid was lettered \"CONTINENTAL\" instead of \"LINCOLN\" (as was the Versailles, the first Lincoln to do so). As Ford Motor Company intended for the Lincoln Continental to compete against the Cadillac Seville, the rear half of the car was designed with a sloping \"bustle-back\" decklid, drawing inspiration from the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] of the late 1930s. The decklid design of the Continental proved less extreme than that of the Seville. The addition of a horizontal brushed-chrome strip that ran along each side of Continental, along with plentiful two-tone color combinations, gave it a more conventional appearance in comparison to the Cadillac.\n\nCoinciding with the introduction of the two-door Continental Mark VII, the Lincoln Continental was given a styling update for the 1984 model year. The body was fitted with flush-fitting front and rear bumpers and revised taillamps. While not fitted with the composite headlights of the Mark VII, the front fascia of the Continental was revised with an angled grille flanked by recessed quad headlamps and larger wrap-around marker lights incorporating cornering lamps, which made it more aerodynamic looking. On the inside, the doors and dashboard were fitted with satin-black trim (accented with low-gloss genuine walnut veneer for the 1986 model year only). Other changes through the rest of production run were primarily limited to paint colors and upholstery pattern details. The car continued thereafter with few changes. All models were also fitted with Ford's door-mounted Keyless Entry System, not to be confused with a [[Remote keyless system|Remote Keyless Entry System]].<ref>{{cite web|title = 1982 Lincoln Continental-16-17|url = http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1982-Lincoln/1982-Lincoln-Continental-Brochure/1982-Lincoln-Continental-16-17|website = oldcarbrochures.org|accessdate = 2015-09-09|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160107075145/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1982-Lincoln/1982-Lincoln-Continental-Brochure/1982-Lincoln-Continental-16-17|archivedate = 2016-01-07}}</ref>\n\n===Trim===\nFor 1982, the Continental was offered in base trim, Signature Series, and Givenchy Designer Series trim. For 1983, the Signature Series trim was discontinued and given to the Town Car and Mark VI; the Valentino Designer Series was added. After the 1985 model year, the Valentino Designer Series was discontinued in favor of the Givenchy Series. Including many additional standard features, the Signature Series, Valentino, and Givenchy Designer Series Continentals added $3,100 to $3,500 to the price of a standard model. Fully optioned Signature and Givenchy models would top out at over $26,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|26500|1982}}}} in current dollars).\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Lincoln Continental (seventh generation)}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Eighth generation (1988\u20131994)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image = A 1991 Lincoln Continental.jpg\n|caption = 1991 Lincoln Continental\n|name = Eighth Generation\n|related  = [[Ford Taurus]]<br />[[Mercury Sable]]<br />[[Ford Windstar]] \n|model_years = 1988\u20131994\n|production = October 1987\u20131994<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99914907/</ref>\n|platform = Ford FN9 platform\n|layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n|assembly =United States: [[Wixom, Michigan]] ([[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]])\n|body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n|engine = 3.8 L [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|''Essex'']] [[V6]]\n|transmission = 4-speed [[Ford AXOD transmission#AXOD-E|AXOD-E]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|109.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---Sept/1990-Lincoln-Continental-Prestige-Brochure/1990-Lincoln-Continental-Prestige-24-25-26</ref>\n|length = 1988\u20131993: {{convert|205.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1994: {{convert|205.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = 1988\u20131993: {{convert|72.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1992\u201394: {{convert|72.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = 1988\u20131991: {{convert|55.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1992\u201394: {{convert|55.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|designer = Jack Telnack (1984)\n}}\n[[File:1989 Lincoln Continental Signature Series.jpg|thumb|left|1989 Lincoln Continental Signature Series]]\n[[File:88-91 Lincoln Continental.jpg|thumb|left|1990\u20131993 Lincoln Continental]]\n[[File:92-94 Lincoln Continental.jpg|thumb|left|1994 Lincoln Continental]]\nBy the late 1980s, the luxury segment in which the Continental competed had changed drastically from a decade before. In addition to traditional competitors Cadillac and Chrysler, the Continental now competed against [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[BMW]], and [[Audi]] as well as the top of the line vehicles of [[Acura]], [[Lexus]], and [[Infiniti]]. In anticipation Lincoln had chosen to completely reinvent the Continental, starting with development of eighth generation model in the 4th quarter of 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0LnCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=en53+1987+ford&source=bl&ots=2iRBfpPpcP&sig=ACfU3U1qtiQ9ibFDXbMdAo-nxv7NW6f61g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjb1N2hnp7gAhVPZawKHVUqBXIQ6AEwCHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=en53+1987+ford&f=false|title=The Perpetual Enterprise Machine: Seven Keys to Corporate Renewal Through Successful Product and Process Development|first1=H.

This Continental became the first front-wheel drive Lincoln and the first Lincoln since 1948 sold without an available V8 engine. As part of a more conservative exterior, the sloping  \"Continental trunklid\" was deleted. Although four inches longer, it was 170 pounds lighter than its predecessor. For the first time since 1980, the Continental closely matched its [[Cadillac de Ville series#1985\u20131993|Cadillac Sedan de Ville]] counterpart in size.\n\nBy interior volume the Continental was the largest front-wheel drive car sold in 1988, and was recognized by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' on its 1989 [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]]. Power was provided by a 140&nbsp;hp 3.8L Essex V6 newly introduced to the Taurus/Sable for 1988. An exclusive feature to the Continental was adaptive air-ride suspension and variable assist power steering was standard. In 1990 (MY 1991), engine output was revised to 155&nbsp;hp, and to 160&nbsp;hp for MY 1993. All Continentals were equipped with a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission.\n\n===Body===\nWhile the exterior of the Continental adopts many of the flowing lines, including the flush-mounted glass, flush-mounted headlights, and wraparound doors of its counterparts alongside the Taurus, it also adopts several more conservative styling features, including a more upright C-pillar, chrome grille, and long deck, and the redesign of the sloping trunklid increased trunk space from 15 to 19 cubic feet (nearly matching the Town Car).\n\nIn October 1988 for 1989 model year, a redesigned dashboard was introduced to accommodate dual air bags. This unprecedented move made the Ford Motor Company the first US automaker to offer airbags as standard equipment for both the driver and front passenger (the second automaker worldwide after Porsche's 1987 944 Turbo).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Ford-Offers-Airbags-For-Passengers-As-Standard-Equipment/id-79d97f461ef138ab538726bf1b418ead|title=Ford Offers Airbags For Passengers As Standard Equipment|work=apnewsarchive.com}}</ref> In 1989 for the 1990 model year, a minor exterior update featured a new grille, hood ornament, and taillights. In late 1993 for MY 1994, a larger facelift was given, including new bumpers, rocker moldings, and bodyside moldings. Exterior trim was redesigned including a restyled argent-colored grille, redesigned taillamps, revised decklid trim, and the Lincoln nameplate is moved onto the grille and taillamps. The bucket seat option was given a redesigned steering wheel.\n\n===Trim===\nAs part of the redesign, Lincoln simplified the trim lineup; only standard (later named \"Executive\") and Signature Series remained. \nFor the first time since 1981, 6-passenger seating made its return. Leather seats were standard (with velour available as a no-cost option). Major options included a compact disc player, [[InstaClear]] electrically heated windshield (1988\u20131992), JBL sound system, power glass moonroof, [[keyless entry]], anti-theft alarm system, cellular phone (starting MY 1990), three-position memory seat, and choice of wheels. For model year 1993 (1992 production), an \"Individual Seats\" group was available which ditched the usual chrome column shifter and 50/50 \"comfort lounge\" split bench seating (and 6-passenger capacity) for a center console with floor shifter (a Continental first), storage armrest, cup holder, and 5 seats. 1994 was the last year that the Continental was offered in Executive and Signature Series trims. An Executive Touring package was also available.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===50th Anniversary Edition (1990)===\nA 50th Anniversary Edition Continental Signature Series was offered during MY 1990 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the model. It featured \"50th Anniversary\" badging, geometric spoked aluminum wheels with unique center hub ornaments, titanium exterior paint with unique red/blue accent striping, and two-toned interior.\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Lincoln Continental (eighth generation)}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ninth generation (1995\u20132002)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Ninth generation\n| image = 1995-1997 Lincoln Continental -- 11-26-2011.jpg\n| caption = 1995\u20131997 Lincoln Continental\n| model_years = 1995\u20132002\n| production  = November 1994\u2013July 26, 2002\n| assembly = United States: [[Wixom, Michigan]] ([[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]])\n| designer = Fritz Mayhew (1991)\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| platform = Ford FN9 platform\n| related = [[Ford Taurus]]<br />[[Mercury Sable]]<br />[[Ford Windstar]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n| engine = 4.6 L [[Ford Modular engine#4-valve|''InTech'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Ford AXOD transmission#AX4N|''AX4N'']] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|109.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = 1995\u20131997: {{convert|206.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1998\u20132002: {{convert|208.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|73.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---August/1999-Lincoln-Continental-Brochure/1999-Lincoln-Continental-06 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818093358/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---August/1999-Lincoln-Continental-Brochure/1999-Lincoln-Continental-06 |archivedate=2017-08-18 }}</ref>\n| height = {{convert|56.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|3868|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n| successor = [[Lincoln MKS]]\n}}\nFor the 1995 model year, the Continental was substantially updated with more rounded lines similar to the Mark VIII and launched on December 26, 1994;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=thTtrQVR8EIC&pg=PA554&lpg=PA554&dq=lincoln+continental+fn74&source=bl&ots=mto5vCH9Hc&sig=ACfU3U2ivIWKEVw70Yuu6DwPv6dB_uih4A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVrPys-53gAhVS7qwKHfzGB3AQ6AEwE3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=lincoln+continental+fn74&f=false|title=The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook: Strategies and Tools for Building a Learning Organization|first1=Peter M.|last1=Senge|first2=Art|last2=Kleiner|first3=Charlotte|last3=Roberts|first4=Richard B.|last4=Ross|first5=Bryan J.|last5=Smith|date=February 16, 1994|publisher=Currency, Doubleday|via=Google Books}}</ref> the interior also saw a major overhaul. Production commenced at Wixom Assembly in November 1994. While the body was all-new, the new Continental shared underpinnings with the previous generation. In a departure from the previous generation and its Ford/Mercury counterparts, the Continental was given back its V8 engine for the first time since 1987 and more closely matched the [[Northstar V8]] engine that Cadillac was using for its DeVille and Seville sedans at the time. The base price for the new Continental was $40,750 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40750|1995}}}} in current dollars).\n\n[[File:1996 Lincoln Continental 4.6L rear 9.11.18.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of 1995\u20131997 Lincoln Continental]]\nThe sole engine for the Continental was the Modular/InTech 32v DOHC 4.6L V8 shared with the Lincoln Mark VIII, but slightly de-tuned for front wheel drive use. It produced {{convert|260|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|265|lb\u00b7ft|Nm|abbr=on}} torque; {{convert|0|-|60|mph|abbr=on}} was reached in 7.2 seconds. Inside, the Continental featured a plush leather interior with many amenities and advanced electronics for the time. Some of the options included JBL sound system, 6-CD changer, power moonroof, heated seats, onboard cellular phone, anti-theft alarm system, traction control, and chrome wheels. As before, buyers could choose between five and six-passenger seating, offering [[Bridge of Weir]] leather on upper trim packages. A March 1992 customer clinic video features a final design prototype of the 1995 Continental.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjL2hpl9JBc|title=FN74 Team Visioning Overview (Voice over early 1990s)|date=11 March 2013|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n1995\u20131996 Continentals had [[air suspension|air ride suspension]] on all four wheels while the 1997 model had rear air suspension and traditional steel coil springs up front. An increasingly competitive luxury market and decontenting of the 1997 Continental saw its base price decreased by 10% that year.\n\n===1998 facelift===\n[[File:Lincoln Continental 09-12-2019.jpg|alt=1998-2002 Lincoln Continental photographed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada|left|thumb|1998-2002 Lincoln Continental]]\nThe Continental was updated again in late 1997 for 1998 with redesigned front and rear end styling. The front-end also held a strong family resemblance to the newly redesigned 1998 Town Car. Also new for 1998 was a dashboard redesign, though still keeping the reflective dash cluster. Despite these notable changes, pricing on the Continental was up only slightly over the 1997 model which itself had seen a price reduction from the year before.\n\nFor 1999, the Continental once again saw only a modest price increase to [[suggested retail price|MSRP]] $38,525 \u2014 the same price as the Town Car. The Continental offered buyers front wheel drive, while the Town Car remained rear wheel drive, and was joined by the slightly smaller [[Lincoln LS]]. This generation Continental gained seat-mounted side airbags and even more power (now up to {{convert|275|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Six-passenger capability was still available via the no-charge option of a split-bench front seat and column shifter. Also available on the 1999 Continental was the \"RESCU package\" (Remote Emergency Satellite Cellular Unit) which included Global satellite positioning (similar to GM's \"OnStar\"), 3-channel [[HomeLink]] compatible garage door opener mounted in the driver's sun visor, voice-activated cellular telephone, and the Alpine audio system (which included a digital sound processor, subwoofer amplifier, and additional speakers). One could also opt for the 6-disc CD changer, heated front seats, and a tinted glass power sunroof with sliding shade. New for 1999 was an extra-cost \"Luxury Appearance Package\" that included a wood-trimmed steering wheel and shift knob with unique two-tone seat trim and floor mats inside, and chrome alloy wheels and a special grille up front. Other available packages were the \"Driver Select System\" which included a semi-active suspension, selectable ride control, steering wheel-mounted controls for the audio and climate systems, automatic day/night outside mirrors, the \"Memory Profile System\" that recalled power steering assist and ride control settings for two drivers, and the \"Personal Security Package\" which included special [[run-flat tire]]s mounted on polished alloy wheels, low tire pressure alert system, and universal garage door opener.\n\nBetween the 2000 and 2002 model years, changes to the Continental remained relatively minor as production of the model eventually came to an end. In 2000, various safety features became standard including child seat-anchor brackets, emergency trunk release, and \"Belt Minder\" system. In 2001, the universal garage door opener was now standard. A new Vehicle Communication System (VCS) featuring hands-free voice activated phone, Safety and Security Services (SOS), information services, and route guidance assistance was optional for 2002.\n\n===Special Editions===\nFor 1996, Lincoln offered two special editions of the Continental. To commemorate the 75th anniversary of Lincoln, a ''Diamond Anniversary Edition'' of the Continental was offered as an option package. The package included \"Diamond Anniversary\" badging, leather seats, voice-activated cellular phone, JBL audio system, auto electrochromatic dimming mirror with compass, and traction control. As a continuation of the version offered the year before on the Town Car, Lincoln offered a ''Spinnaker Edition'' of the 1996 Continental. The option package featured \"Spinnaker Edition\" badging, tri-coat paint, two-toned leather seats, and 16\" spoked aluminum wheels.\n\nFor 2001, a ''Limited Edition'' was offered, featuring unique leather interior with \"Limited\" embroidery, two-toned interior trim, wood steering wheel, 6-disc CD changer, and 16\" spoked aluminum wheels. It was sold as a Greenbrier Limited Edition Continental in select markets.\n\nTo commemorate the end of the model run for 2002, a ''Collector's Edition'' was offered featuring a genuine walnut burl steering wheel, instrument panel, and side door trim, \"CE\" logos, platinum painted grille, 10-spoke chrome wheels, and more.

Along with declining sales of the model line, Lincoln faced a significant model overlap as the Continental, LS V8, and Town Car competed in nearly the same price range. As the LS V8 was a mid-size sport luxury sedan and the Town Car was a full-size luxury sedan, the Continental was withdrawn, with the final ninth-generation vehicle rolling off the Wixom Assembly production line on July 26, 2002.\n\nAfter 2002, the Continental was not directly replaced. For 2009, Lincoln introduced the MKS; while intended to replace the Town Car (which remained until 2011), the MKS was closer in length and width to the ninth-generation Continental and based on a front-wheel drive chassis (with all-wheel drive as an option). In place of a V8 engine, the MKS offered a twin-turbocharged V6 as an option. For the 2017 model year, the MKS was replaced by the new tenth-generation Continental.\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Lincoln Continental (ninth generation)}}\n\n==Tenth generation (2017\u2013present)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Tenth generation\n| image = 2019 Lincoln Continental \"Select\", front 10.29.19.jpg\n| production = 2016\u2013present\n| model_years = 2017\u2013present\n| assembly = United States: [[Flat Rock, Michigan|Flat Rock]], [[Michigan]] ([[Flat Rock Assembly Plant]])\n| designer = Max Wolff (2013), David Woodhouse (2014)\n| class = [[Full-size]] [[luxury car]] ([[F-segment|F]])\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| doors = Conventional doors (4 doors)<br>Conventional doors (front)/[[Suicide door|Coach Doors]] (rear) (Lincoln Coach Door Edition)\n| platform = [[Ford CD4 platform]]\n| related = [[Lincoln MKZ]]<br>[[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]]<br>[[Ford Mondeo]]<br>[[Ford Taurus (China)]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]] / [[Front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout|F4 layout]]\n| engine = 3.7 L ''[[Ford Cyclone engine#3.7 L|Cyclone]]'' V6<br>2.7 L ''[[Ford EcoBoost engine#V-type 6-cylinder|EcoBoost]]'' V6 [[twin-turbo]] <br>3.0 L ''EcoBoost'' V6 [[twin-turbo]]\n| transmission = [[GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission|6F55]] 6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|117.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|201.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|75.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|58.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>2017 Lincoln Continental.

The Continental is manufactured in Flat Rock, Michigan, alongside the Ford Mustang. This is the first Continental generation since 1958 that is not assembled at the Ford Motor Company [[Wixom Assembly Plant]].\n\n===Chassis===\nThe tenth-generation Lincoln Continental is based upon the [[Ford CD4 platform]]. Shared with the Ford Fusion (Mondeo) and Lincoln MKZ, the Continental shares an extended-wheelbase CD4 chassis with the seventh-generation Ford Taurus. At 117.9 inches (5.7 inches longer than the Fusion/MKZ), the Continental is the longest-wheelbase Lincoln sedan produced since 1979 with the exception of the long wheelbase L Town Cars. While front-wheel drive is standard, this generation marks the first use of all-wheel drive on a Lincoln Continental, but depending on trim, all-wheel drive is either optional or standard equipment.\n\nWhile sharing its fundamental chassis underpinnings with the Lincoln MKZ, the Continental is powered exclusively by V6 engines. As a standard engine, a 305&nbsp;hp 3.7L Ti-VCT V6, shared with the MKZ and MKS. As an option, a 335&nbsp;hp 2.7L twin-turbocharged V6 is available, shared with the Lincoln MKX. At the top of the engine lineup, the Continental is fitted with a {{Convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.0L twin-turbocharged V6; exclusive to the Continental and MKZ, the 3.0L engine is the highest-horsepower engine ever fitted to a production Lincoln car (Navigator SUV is available with {{Convert|450|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.5L twin-turbo V6 ).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} All three engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. When fitted with the 3.0L engine, all-wheel drive (with [[torque vectoring#All-Wheel Drive Vectoring|torque vectoring]]) is standard equipment. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Engine\n!Configuration\n!Output\n!Transmission\n|-\n|3.7L Ti-VCT V6 ([[Ford Cyclone engine#3.7 L|Ford Cyclone 37]])\n|{{Convert|227|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} DOHC 24V V6\n|{{Convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6500 rpm\n{{Convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000 rpm\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Ford [[GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission|6F55/SelectShift]] 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|2.7L Twin-turbocharged V6 ([[Ford EcoBoost engine#2.7-L Nano|EcoBoost Nano 2.7L]])\n|{{Convert|164|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} DOHC 24V V6\ntwin-turbocharged\n|{{Convert|335|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5500 rpm\n{{Convert|380|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3000 rpm\n|-\n|3.0L Twin-turbocharged V6 ([[Ford EcoBoost engine#3.0-L Nano|EcoBoost Nano 3.0L]]) \n|{{Convert|183|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} DOHC 24V V6\ntwin-turbocharged, gasoline direct injection\n|{{Convert|400|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5750 rpm\n{{Convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2750 rpm\n|}\n\n===Body===\nDeriving much of its exterior from the 2015 Lincoln Continental concept car, the tenth-generation Continental introduced a new design theme for the Lincoln division, shifting from the previous split grille to a rectangular design, with a slightly recessed grille. Standard equipment includes electronically-latched doors, marketed as \"E-Latch\", to pulls the door closed. Interior door panels use a button near the door pull handle to unlatch the door;<ref name=\"Lincoln Media Center\" /> on the outside, the exterior door pulls are integrated into the [[Beltline (automotive)|beltline window trim]].\n\nIn place of a console or column-mounted transmission shifter, control of the transmission was changed to \"PRNDS\" buttons mounted to the left of the infotainment/navigation touch screen. \"S\" represents \"Sport mode\", where the suspension, power steering, and transmission shifting are programmed for more spirited driving. While largely done in an effort to increase center console space, the layout is a similar approach to [[Chrysler PowerFlite transmission|Chrysler]] and [[Ultramatic#1956: Ultramatic and Touchbutton Ultramatic|Packard]] designs of the 1950s (though the Continental is also fitted with paddle shifters as standard equipment). As an option, the Continental is available with either 13 or 19-speaker audio systems from the \"Revel\" division of [[Harman International Industries|Harman]], distinguished by aluminum speaker grilles in the door panels. As with the Lincoln MKS, the Continental is fitted with adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping technology, as an option, the Continental offers a 360-degree camera system to produce a \"virtual overhead view\" of the vehicle.<ref name=\"media.lincoln.com\">https://media.lincoln.com/content/dam/lincolnmedia/lna/us/2016/01/12/effortless-power-fact-sheet.pdf</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Lincoln Continental X 02 China 2017-03-23.jpg|2017 Lincoln Continental, side view ([[Changchun, China]])\nFile:2017 Lincoln Continental interior.jpg|2017 Lincoln Continental dashboard\nFile:2019 Lincoln Continental \"Select\", rear 10.29.19.jpg|2019 Lincoln Continental, rear view\n</gallery>\n\n=== Trim ===\nIn line with current Lincoln product offerings, the Lincoln Continental is offered in three standard trims, Premiere, Select, and Reserve.

Directed by [[Chris Sanders]], in his live-action directorial debut, the film was written by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[Omar Sy]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Bradley Whitford]], and [[Colin Woodell]]. Set during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], the film follows a dog named Buck as he is stolen from his home in California and sent to the Yukon, where he befriends an old outdoorsman and begins a life-altering adventure.\n\n''The Call of the Wild'' was released in the United States on February 21, 2020, by [[20th Century Studios]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the \"entertaining action and earnest tone\" but criticized the \"uncanny\" CGI of the animals.<ref name=WrapProj/> The film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed $107 million against a production budget of $125\u2013150 million, and is projected to lose the studio $50\u2013100 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the late 19th century Gold Rush, Buck, a large, gentle [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Scotch Collie]], lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller in [[Santa Clara, California]]. One night, Buck is abducted and shipped to the [[Yukon]] aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member ill-treats him. After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton, moments before being sold to Perrault and his assistant, Francoise. They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: \"It's okay, boy. You're home.\"\n\nThe next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as John Thornton\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Perrault\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Hal\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Mercedes\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Judge Miller\n* [[Colin Woodell]] as Charles\n* [[Cara Gee]] as Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)| Scott MacDonald]] as Dawson \n\nActor and stunt coordinator [[Terry Notary]] stood in for the CGI-created Buck, whose model was scanned after an adopted dog.\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing a new film adaptation of [[Jack London]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', set in [[the Yukon]] during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]].

Directed by [[Chris Sanders]], in his live-action directorial debut, the film was written by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[Omar Sy]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Bradley Whitford]], and [[Colin Woodell]]. Set during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], the film follows a dog named Buck as he is stolen from his home in California and sent to the Yukon, where he befriends an old outdoorsman and begins a life-altering adventure.\n\n''The Call of the Wild'' was released in the United States on February 21, 2020, by [[20th Century Studios]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the \"entertaining action and earnest tone\" but criticized the \"uncanny\" CGI of the animals.<ref name=WrapProj/> The film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed $107 million against a production budget of $125\u2013150 million, and is projected to lose the studio $50\u2013100 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the late 19th century Gold Rush, Buck, a large, gentle [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Scotch Collie]], lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller in [[Santa Clara, California]]. One night, Buck is abducted and shipped to the [[Yukon]] aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member ill-treats him. After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton, moments before being sold to Perrault and his assistant, Francoise. They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: \"It's okay, boy. You're home.\"\n\nThe next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as John Thornton\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Perrault\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Hal\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Mercedes\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Judge Miller\n* [[Colin Woodell]] as Charles\n* [[Cara Gee]] as Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)| Scott MacDonald]] as Dawson \n\nActor and stunt coordinator [[Terry Notary]] stood in for the CGI-created Buck, whose model was scanned after an adopted dog.\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing a new film adaptation of [[Jack London]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', set in [[the Yukon]] during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]].

The population is approximately 94,000, according to estimates from ESRI. Edmond is the fifth largest city in the state of Oklahoma. \n\nThe city borders the northern boundary of [[Oklahoma City]]. Two major highways connect Edmond to downtown Oklahoma City: [[U.S. Route 77]] (Broadway Extension), which runs along the west side of Edmond, and [[Interstate 35]], which runs through the center of Edmond. Additionally historic [[U. S. Route 66]] enters Edmond from the east as it passes just north of [[Arcadia Lake (Oklahoma)]] to join 2nd Street. As [[U. S. Route 66]] continues west on 2nd Street it joins [[U. S. Route 77]] in downtown Edmond where it turns south at Broadway. Public transportation is provided by Citylink Edmond bus service.\n\n==Geography==\nEdmond is located just north of [[Oklahoma City]] in [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|87.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|85.1|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|2.8|sqmi|km2}} or 3.19% is water.

Prolonged and severe droughts often lead to wildfires and heavy rainfall often leads to flash flooding and flooding. Consistent winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly winds during the winter can intensify cold periods. Severe [[ice storm]]s and [[snowstorm]]s happen sporadically during the winter.\n\nThe city is located in [[Tornado Alley]] and is subject to frequent and severe tornadoes and hailstorms. The [[Oklahoma City metropolitan area]] is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890=294\n|1900=965\n|1910=2090\n|1920=2452\n|1930=3576\n|1940=4002\n|1950=6086\n|1960=8577\n|1970=16633\n|1980=34637\n|1990=52315\n|2000=68315\n|2010=81405\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=93127\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|author=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 30, 2019|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501024023/https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=May 1, 2019|author-link=United States Census Bureau }}</ref><br> 2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\">{{cite web|title=Population Estimates|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAccording to estimates from ESRI: There are approximately 94,000 residents and approximately 37,000 housing units.

in the central part of the state. The population is approximately 94,000, according to estimates from ESRI. Edmond is the fifth largest city in the state of Oklahoma. \n\nThe city borders the northern boundary of [[Oklahoma City]]. Two major highways connect Edmond to downtown Oklahoma City: [[U.S. Route 77]] (Broadway Extension), which runs along the west side of Edmond, and [[Interstate 35]], which runs through the center of Edmond. Additionally historic [[U. S. Route 66]] enters Edmond from the east as it passes just north of [[Arcadia Lake (Oklahoma)]] to join 2nd Street. As [[U. S. Route 66]] continues west on 2nd Street it joins [[U. S. Route 77]] in downtown Edmond where it turns south as Broadway. Public transportation is provided by Citylink Edmond bus service.\n\n==Geography==\nEdmond is located just north of [[Oklahoma City]] in [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|87.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|85.1|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|2.8|sqmi|km2}} or 3.19% is water. [[Arcadia Lake (Oklahoma)|Arcadia Lake]] on the east side of the city is a fishing spot for the [[Oklahoma City metropolitan area]] and contains bluegill, channel catfish, blue catfish, and largemouth bass.<ref>[http://edmondok.com/index.aspx?nid=338 Arcadia Lake], City of Edmond.
