At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely considered a turning point in the development of aviation.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. \n\nIn March 1932, Lindbergh's infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]], if the kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the provision of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]]. He flew 50 missions in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II as a civilian consultant,<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Colonel Lindbergh On Combat Missions|newspaper=[[The San Bernardino Daily Sun]]|location=San Bernardino, California|date=23 October 1944|volume=51|page=1}}</ref> but did not take up arms against Germany, and Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission.

Though Lindbergh had not touched an airplane in more than six months, he had already secretly decided he was ready to take to the air by himself.

In October, Lindbergh flew his Jenny to [[Iowa]], where he sold it to a flying student. After selling the Jenny, Lindbergh returned to Lincoln by train. There, he joined Leon Klink and continued to barnstorm through the South for the next few months in Klink's Curtiss JN-4C \"Canuck\" (the Canadian version of the Jenny).

Lindbergh's receipt of the German medal was approved without objection by the American embassy; the war had not yet begun in Europe. The award did not cause controversy until the war began and Lindbergh returned to the United States in 1939 to spread his message of nonintervention. Berg contended Lindbergh's views were commonplace in the United States in the pre\u2013World War II era.

At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely considered a turning point in the development of aviation.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. \n\nIn March 1932, Lindbergh's infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]], if the kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the provision of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]]. He flew 50 missions in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II as a civilian consultant,<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Colonel Lindbergh On Combat Missions|newspaper=[[The San Bernardino Daily Sun]]|location=San Bernardino, California|date=23 October 1944|volume=51|page=1}}</ref> but did not take up arms against Germany, and Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission.
