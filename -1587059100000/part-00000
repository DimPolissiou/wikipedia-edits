It was discovered in 1799, and eventually led to the ability to decipher ancient hieroglyphs. Although the Rosetta Stone was discovered by the French, it actually never made it to the Louvre Museum. It was seized by British Forces following the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801.<ref>Parkinson, p. 28</ref> It is now on display at the [[British Museum]].<ref>Bierman, p. 161</ref>\n\nAfter the French defeat at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], the works' former owners sought their return.

Some 10% to 35% of the pieces are believed to come from Jewish spoliations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/mnr/Matteoli/RM-musees-nationaux.pdf |title=Rapport Matteoli, Le pillage de l'art en France pendant l'occupation et la situation des 2000 oeuvres confi\u00e9es aux Mus\u00e9es nationaux, pp. 50, 60, 69 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> and until the identification of their rightful owners, which declined at the end of the 1960s, they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum's collections.\n\nThey were exhibited in 1946 and shown all together to the public during four years (1950\u20131954) in order to allow rightful claimants to identify their properties, then stored or displayed, according to their interest, in several French museums including the Louvre. From 1951 to 1965, about 37 pieces were restituted. Since November 1996, the partly illustrated catalogue of 1947\u20131949 has been accessible online and completed. In 1997, Prime Minister [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] initiated the Matt\u00e9oli Commission, headed by [[Jean Matt\u00e9oli]], to investigate the matter and according to the government, the Louvre is in charge of 678&nbsp;pieces of artwork still unclaimed by their rightful owners.<ref>Rickman, p.&nbsp;294</ref> During the late 1990s, the comparison of the American war archives, which had not been done before, with the French and German ones as well as two court cases which finally settled some of the heirs' rights (Gentili di Giuseppe and Rosenberg families) allowed more accurate investigations. Since 1996, the restitutions, according sometimes to less formal criteria, concerned 47 more pieces (26 paintings, with 6 from the Louvre including a then displayed Tiepolo), until the last claims of French owners and their heirs ended again in 2006.\n\nAccording to [[Serge Klarsfeld]], since the now complete and constant publicity which the artworks got in 1996, the majority of the French Jewish community is nevertheless in favour of the return to the normal French civil rule of ''prescription acquisitive'' of any unclaimed good after another long period of time and consequently to their ultimate integration into the common French heritage instead of their transfer to foreign institutions like during World War II.\n\nNapoleon's campaigns acquired Italian pieces by treaties, as war reparations, and Northern European pieces as spoils as well as some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though the vast majority of the latter were seized as war reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the [[British Museum]]. On the other hand, the [[Dendera zodiac]] is, like the [[Rosetta Stone]], claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return.

This treaty not only marked the completion of Napoleon's conquest of Italy, but also the end of the first phases of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Under this treaty, Italian cities were required to contribute pieces of art and patrimony to take part in Napoleon's \"parades of booty\" through Paris before being put into the Louvre Museum.<ref name=\"Plant, p. 36\">Plant, p. 36</ref> One of the most famous pieces taken under this program was the [[Horses of Saint Mark]].

Some 10% to 35% of the pieces are believed to come from Jewish spoliations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/mnr/Matteoli/RM-musees-nationaux.pdf |title=Rapport Matteoli, Le pillage de l'art en France pendant l'occupation et la situation des 2000 oeuvres confi\u00e9es aux Mus\u00e9es nationaux, pp. 50, 60, 69 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> and until the identification of their rightful owners, which declined at the end of the 1960s, they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum's collections.\n\nThey were exhibited in 1946 and shown all together to the public during four years (1950\u20131954) in order to allow rightful claimants to identify their properties, then stored or displayed, according to their interest, in several French museums including the Louvre. From 1951 to 1965, about 37 pieces were restituted. Since November 1996, the partly illustrated catalogue of 1947\u20131949 has been accessible online and completed. In 1997, Prime Minister [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] initiated the Matt\u00e9oli Commission, headed by [[Jean Matt\u00e9oli]], to investigate the matter and according to the government, the Louvre is in charge of 678&nbsp;pieces of artwork still unclaimed by their rightful owners.<ref>Rickman, p.&nbsp;294</ref> During the late 1990s, the comparison of the American war archives, which had not been done before, with the French and German ones as well as two court cases which finally settled some of the heirs' rights (Gentili di Giuseppe and Rosenberg families) allowed more accurate investigations. Since 1996, the restitutions, according sometimes to less formal criteria, concerned 47 more pieces (26 paintings, with 6 from the Louvre including a then displayed Tiepolo), until the last claims of French owners and their heirs ended again in 2006.\n\nAccording to [[Serge Klarsfeld]], since the now complete and constant publicity which the artworks got in 1996, the majority of the French Jewish community is nevertheless in favour of the return to the normal French civil rule of ''prescription acquisitive'' of any unclaimed good after another long period of time and consequently to their ultimate integration into the common French heritage instead of their transfer to foreign institutions like during World War II.\n\nNapoleon's campaigns acquired Italian pieces by treaties, as war reparations, and Northern European pieces as spoils as well as some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though the vast majority of the latter were seized as war reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the [[British Museum]]. On the other hand, the [[Dendera zodiac]] is, like the [[Rosetta Stone]], claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return.

Located on [[Resurrection Bay]], a [[Fjord|fjord]] of the [[Gulf of Alaska]] on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], Seward is situated on Alaska's southern coast, approximately 120 miles by road from Alaska's largest city, [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], and nearly 1,300 miles from the closest point in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous United States]] at [[Cape Flattery]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\nWith a population of 2,693 people as of the 2010 Census,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=U.S. Census website|last=Bureau|first=U.S. Census|website=[[United States Census Bureau]]|language=en|access-date=2018-09-20}}</ref> Seward is the fourth-largest city in the [[Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska|Kenai Peninsula Borough]], behind [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]], [[Homer, Alaska|Homer]], and the borough seat of [[Soldotna, Alaska|Soldotna]]. The city is named for former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]], who orchestrated the United States' [[Alaska Purchase|purchase of Alaska]] from the [[Russian Empire]] in 1867 while serving in this position as part of President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s administration.\n\nSeward is the southern terminus of the [[Alaska Railroad]] and the historic starting point of the original [[Iditarod Trail]] to [[Interior Alaska]], with Mile 0 of the trail marked on the shoreline at the southern end of town.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2015}}\nIn 1793 [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov|Alexander Baranov]] of the [[Shelikhov-Golikov company]] (precursor of the [[Russian-American Company]]) established a [[fur trade]] post on [[Resurrection Bay]] where Seward is today, and had a three-masted vessel, the ''[[Phoenix (Alaska)|Phoenix]]'', built at the post by James Shields, an English shipwright in Russian service.<ref>{{cite book |last= Haycox |first= Stephen W. |title= Alaska: An American Colony |year= 2002 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 978-0-295-98249-6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8yu3pYpzLdUC |page= 82}}</ref>\n\nThe 1939 [[Slattery Report]] on Alaskan development identified the region as one of the areas where new settlements would be established through Jewish [[immigration]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} This plan was never implemented.\n\nSeward was an important port for the military buildup in Alaska during [[World War II]].  [[Fort Raymond (Alaska)|Fort Raymond]] was established in Seward along the Resurrection River to protect the community.  An Army airfield built in Seward during the war later became [[Walseth Air Force Base]]. Both of the military facilities were closed shortly after the end of the war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adn.com/our-alaska/article/veteran-recalls-wwii-duty-remote-alaska-outpost/2012/11/09/|title=Veteran recalls WWII duty in remote Alaska outpost|website=adn.com|access-date=2017-06-30}}</ref>\n\nA large portion of Seward was damaged by shaking and a local [[tsunami]] during the [[1964 Alaska earthquake]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/tsunamis/alaska/1964/webpages/1964seward.html|title=Effects of the 1964 Tsunami on Seward Alaska|website=usc.edu|access-date=2016-05-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010124231600/http://www.usc.edu/dept/tsunamis/alaska/1964/webpages/1964seward.html|archivedate=2001-01-24}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Seward Alaska aerial view.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Seward, Alaska in the 1990s, looking north. The mouth of the [[Resurrection River]] and the base of [[Mount Marathon]] are visible.]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|21.5|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|14.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|7.1|sqmi|km2}} (32.93%) is water.\n\nThe northern city limits are demarcated by the lower reaches of the [[Resurrection River]], but extend east past the river's mouth at the northern end of Resurrection Bay to include parts of the bay's extreme northeastern shore, including the beach at the mouth of [[Fourth of July Creek (Kenai Peninsula, Alaska)|Fourth of July Creek]] and the grounds of [[Spring Creek Correctional Center]] just inland. To the south, the city limits extend to the unincorporated community of [[Lowell Point, Alaska|Lowell Point]], while the east and west sides of the city are constrained by Resurrection Bay and the steep slopes of [[Mount Marathon]].\n\nNearby settlements include the aforementioned [[Lowell Point, Alaska|Lowell Point]] to the south, as well as the [[census-designated place]]s of [[Bear Creek, Alaska|Bear Creek]] and [[Moose Pass, Alaska|Moose Pass]] further north. The nearest incorporated city is [[Soldotna, Alaska|Soldatna]], about 90 miles away by road to the northwest.\n\n===Climate===\nBy definition, Seward has a [[subarctic climate]] (K\u00f6ppen ''Dfc''), but it experiences relatively moderate temperatures compared to the rest of the state throughout the year due to the influence of the nearby [[Gulf of Alaska]]. Only one month, January, sees an average daily high temperature below freezing, and temperatures below zero degrees [[Fahrenheit]] are rare. The oceanic influence also imparts a high level of precipitation, with the heaviest amounts occurring during the fall and winter months.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Seward Airport (1981\u22122010 normals)\n|single line = Y\n|collapsed =\n| Jan record high F = 55\n| Feb record high F = 55\n| Mar record high F = 67\n| Apr record high F = 72\n| May record high F = 83\n| Jun record high F = 84\n| Jul record high F = 88\n| Aug record high F = 95\n| Sep record high F = 84\n| Oct record high F = 65\n| Nov record high F = 58\n| Dec record high F = 53\n\n| Jan avg record high F =42.9\n| Feb avg record high F =44.0\n| Mar avg record high F =47.2\n| Apr avg record high F =55.5\n| May avg record high F =65.7\n| Jun avg record high F =72.2\n| Jul avg record high F =76.7\n| Aug avg record high F =74.5\n| Sep avg record high F =66.1\n| Oct avg record high F =54.6\n| Nov avg record high F =46.6\n| Dec avg record high F =43.0\n|year avg record high F =79.2\n|Jan high F = 31.8\n|Feb high F = 33.4\n|Mar high F = 37.8\n|Apr high F = 44.8\n|May high F = 53.0\n|Jun high F = 58.3\n|Jul high F = 61.3\n|Aug high F = 61.5\n|Sep high F = 55.2\n|Oct high F = 44.5\n|Nov high F = 35.4\n|Dec high F = 33.6\n|year high F= 45.9\n|Jan mean F = 27.1\n|Feb mean F = 28.3\n|Mar mean F = 32.1\n|Apr mean F = 38.7\n|May mean F = 46.4\n|Jun mean F = 52.2\n|Jul mean F = 56.0\n|Aug mean F = 55.7\n|Sep mean F = 49.5\n|Oct mean F = 39.6\n|Nov mean F = 30.9\n|Dec mean F = 28.9\n|year mean F= 40.6\n|Jan low F = 22.3\n|Feb low F = 23.2\n|Mar low F = 26.4\n|Apr low F = 32.5\n|May low F = 39.9\n|Jun low F = 46.1\n|Jul low F = 50.7\n|Aug low F = 50.0\n|Sep low F = 43.8\n|Oct low F = 34.7\n|Nov low F = 26.4\n|Dec low F = 24.2\n|year low F= 35.0\n| Jan avg record low F = 1.2\n| Feb avg record low F = 4.5\n| Mar avg record low F = 8.7\n| Apr avg record low F = 21.4\n| May avg record low F = 30.9\n| Jun avg record low F = 37.6\n| Jul avg record low F = 42.4\n| Aug avg record low F = 40.9\n| Sep avg record low F = 33.5\n| Oct avg record low F = 22.0\n| Nov avg record low F = 11.5\n| Dec avg record low F = 3.8\n|year avg record low F = \u22123.6\n| Jan record low F = \u221220\n| Feb record low F = \u221217\n| Mar record low F = \u22127\n| Apr record low F = \u22121\n| May record low F = 14\n| Jun record low F = 30\n| Jul record low F = 30\n| Aug record low F = 30\n| Sep record low F = 26\n| Oct record low F = 8\n| Nov record low F = \u22124\n| Dec record low F = \u221212\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 8.07\n|Feb precipitation inch = 6.05\n|Mar precipitation inch = 4.42\n|Apr precipitation inch = 4.52\n|May precipitation inch = 3.37\n|Jun precipitation inch = 2.42\n|Jul precipitation inch = 2.80\n|Aug precipitation inch = 5.61\n|Sep precipitation inch = 9.86\n|Oct precipitation inch = 9.35\n|Nov precipitation inch = 7.31\n|Dec precipitation inch = 9.54\n\n|Jan snow inch = 12.9\n|Feb snow inch = 12.6\n|Mar snow inch = 10.5\n|Apr snow inch =  3.7\n|May snow inch =   .3\n|Jun snow inch =    0\n|Jul snow inch =    0\n|Aug snow inch =    0\n|Sep snow inch =    0\n|Oct snow inch =   .5\n|Nov snow inch =  8.2\n|Dec snow inch = 15.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 in\n|Jan precipitation days = 15.1\n|Feb precipitation days = 13.7\n|Mar precipitation days = 13.1\n|Apr precipitation days = 13.7\n|May precipitation days = 13.5\n|Jun precipitation days = 11.6\n|Jul precipitation days = 12.5\n|Aug precipitation days = 14.1\n|Sep precipitation days = 16.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 16.5\n|Nov precipitation days = 14.3\n|Dec precipitation days = 16.6\n|unit snow days = 0.1 in\n|Jan snow days = 5.8\n|Feb snow days = 5.0\n|Mar snow days = 4.7\n|Apr snow days = 2.2\n|May snow days =  .1\n|Jun snow days =   0\n|Jul snow days =   0\n|Aug snow days =   0\n|Sep snow days =   0\n|Oct snow days =  .8\n|Nov snow days = 3.9\n|Dec snow days = 6.7\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref>{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/station/USW00026438.normals.txt |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |title=Station Name: AK SEWARD AP |accessdate=2013-07-05}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Seward harbor.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Boats in the harbor|Boats in the harbor, with the snow-capped peak of [[Mount Alice (Alaska)|Mount Alice]] across the bay to the east in the background.]]Seward's local economy is largely driven by the [[commercial fishing]] industry and seasonal [[tourism]]. Many lodging facilities, restaurants and shops in the city cater mainly to tourists, and are only open for business during the summer tourist season, generally regarded as running from mid-May through mid-September. Other major employers in the city include the [[Alaska Department of Corrections|state-run]] Spring Creek Correctional Center, the [[Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development|Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development's]] AVTEC vocational school, and the local [[Providence Health & Services]] branch, which also serves as the community's main medical center.\n\n=== Fishing ===\nSeward is the site of an annual salmon run which, in the 1920s, came to \"countless millions\" and supported a community of fisherman of mainly Scandinavian origin.  It was then the headquarters of the halibut fleet.<ref name=LThomas>{{cite book|title=The First World Flight|url=https://archive.org/details/firstworldflight0000thom|url-access=registration|last=Thomas|first=Lowell|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|date=1925|place=Boston & New York}}</ref>{{rp|67}}\n\nSeward is among the most lucrative commercial fisheries ports in the United States, according to reports from the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]].

Seward is also the southern terminus of the [[Alaska Railroad]] with the railroad serving the Port of Seward which is capable of accommodating ocean going vessels. This keeps the port busy with freight coming on and off the trains, but also makes Seward a primary end point for north-bound [[cruise ship]]s. Cruise ship passengers disembark and often take the train or bus farther north to Anchorage, [[Denali]], or other Alaskan attractions.  The Alaska Railroad operates passenger service into Seward on a seasonal basis via the \n''[[Coastal Classic]]'' train.\n\nSeward is a very bike friendly community. A paved bike path runs from the downtown business district along the waterfront, through the harbor and along the highway to mile 4.5. Bikes are available for rent and there are guided bike tours of the area.\n\n[[Alaska Marine Highway]] (ferry) service was discontinued at the end of the 2005.

The oceanic influence also imparts a high level of precipitation, with the heaviest amounts occurring during the fall and winter months.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Seward Airport (1981\u22122010 normals)\n|single line = Y\n|collapsed =\n| Jan record high F = 55\n| Feb record high F = 55\n| Mar record high F = 67\n| Apr record high F = 72\n| May record high F = 83\n| Jun record high F = 84\n| Jul record high F = 88\n| Aug record high F = 95\n| Sep record high F = 84\n| Oct record high F = 65\n| Nov record high F = 58\n| Dec record high F = 53\n\n| Jan avg record high F =42.9\n| Feb avg record high F =44.0\n| Mar avg record high F =47.2\n| Apr avg record high F =55.5\n| May avg record high F =65.7\n| Jun avg record high F =72.2\n| Jul avg record high F =76.7\n| Aug avg record high F =74.5\n| Sep avg record high F =66.1\n| Oct avg record high F =54.6\n| Nov avg record high F =46.6\n| Dec avg record high F =43.0\n|year avg record high F =79.2\n|Jan high F = 31.8\n|Feb high F = 33.4\n|Mar high F = 37.8\n|Apr high F = 44.8\n|May high F = 53.0\n|Jun high F = 58.3\n|Jul high F = 61.3\n|Aug high F = 61.5\n|Sep high F = 55.2\n|Oct high F = 44.5\n|Nov high F = 35.4\n|Dec high F = 33.6\n|year high F= 45.9\n|Jan mean F = 27.1\n|Feb mean F = 28.3\n|Mar mean F = 32.1\n|Apr mean F = 38.7\n|May mean F = 46.4\n|Jun mean F = 52.2\n|Jul mean F = 56.0\n|Aug mean F = 55.7\n|Sep mean F = 49.5\n|Oct mean F = 39.6\n|Nov mean F = 30.9\n|Dec mean F = 28.9\n|year mean F= 40.6\n|Jan low F = 22.3\n|Feb low F = 23.2\n|Mar low F = 26.4\n|Apr low F = 32.5\n|May low F = 39.9\n|Jun low F = 46.1\n|Jul low F = 50.7\n|Aug low F = 50.0\n|Sep low F = 43.8\n|Oct low F = 34.7\n|Nov low F = 26.4\n|Dec low F = 24.2\n|year low F= 35.0\n| Jan avg record low F = 1.2\n| Feb avg record low F = 4.5\n| Mar avg record low F = 8.7\n| Apr avg record low F = 21.4\n| May avg record low F = 30.9\n| Jun avg record low F = 37.6\n| Jul avg record low F = 42.4\n| Aug avg record low F = 40.9\n| Sep avg record low F = 33.5\n| Oct avg record low F = 22.0\n| Nov avg record low F = 11.5\n| Dec avg record low F = 3.8\n|year avg record low F = \u22123.6\n| Jan record low F = \u221220\n| Feb record low F = \u221217\n| Mar record low F = \u22127\n| Apr record low F = \u22121\n| May record low F = 14\n| Jun record low F = 30\n| Jul record low F = 30\n| Aug record low F = 30\n| Sep record low F = 26\n| Oct record low F = 8\n| Nov record low F = \u22124\n| Dec record low F = \u221212\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 8.07\n|Feb precipitation inch = 6.05\n|Mar precipitation inch = 4.42\n|Apr precipitation inch = 4.52\n|May precipitation inch = 3.37\n|Jun precipitation inch = 2.42\n|Jul precipitation inch = 2.80\n|Aug precipitation inch = 5.61\n|Sep precipitation inch = 9.86\n|Oct precipitation inch = 9.35\n|Nov precipitation inch = 7.31\n|Dec precipitation inch = 9.54\n\n|Jan snow inch = 12.9\n|Feb snow inch = 12.6\n|Mar snow inch = 10.5\n|Apr snow inch =  3.7\n|May snow inch =   .3\n|Jun snow inch =    0\n|Jul snow inch =    0\n|Aug snow inch =    0\n|Sep snow inch =    0\n|Oct snow inch =   .5\n|Nov snow inch =  8.2\n|Dec snow inch = 15.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 in\n|Jan precipitation days = 15.1\n|Feb precipitation days = 13.7\n|Mar precipitation days = 13.1\n|Apr precipitation days = 13.7\n|May precipitation days = 13.5\n|Jun precipitation days = 11.6\n|Jul precipitation days = 12.5\n|Aug precipitation days = 14.1\n|Sep precipitation days = 16.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 16.5\n|Nov precipitation days = 14.3\n|Dec precipitation days = 16.6\n|unit snow days = 0.1 in\n|Jan snow days = 5.8\n|Feb snow days = 5.0\n|Mar snow days = 4.7\n|Apr snow days = 2.2\n|May snow days =  .1\n|Jun snow days =   0\n|Jul snow days =   0\n|Aug snow days =   0\n|Sep snow days =   0\n|Oct snow days =  .8\n|Nov snow days = 3.9\n|Dec snow days = 6.7\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref>{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/station/USW00026438.normals.txt |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |title=Station Name: AK SEWARD AP |accessdate=2013-07-05}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Seward harbor.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Boats in the harbor|Boats in the harbor, with the snow-capped peak of [[Mount Alice (Alaska)|Mount Alice]] across the bay to the east in the background.]]Seward's local economy is largely driven by the [[commercial fishing]] industry and seasonal [[tourism]].

Seward is also the southern terminus of the [[Alaska Railroad]] with the railroad serving the Port of Seward which is capable of accommodating ocean going vessels. This keeps the port busy with freight coming on and off the trains, but also makes Seward a primary end point for north-bound [[cruise ship]]s. Cruise ship passengers disembark and often take the train or bus farther north to Anchorage, [[Denali]], or other Alaskan attractions.  The Alaska Railroad operates passenger service into Seward on a seasonal basis via the \n''[[Coastal Classic]]'' train.\n\nSeward is a very bike friendly community. A paved bike path runs from the downtown business district along the waterfront, through the harbor and along the highway to mile 4.5. Bikes are available for rent and there are guided bike tours of the area.\n\n[[Alaska Marine Highway]] (ferry) service was discontinued at the end of the 2005.
