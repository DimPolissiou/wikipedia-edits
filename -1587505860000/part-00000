The trio were likened to the [[Greek chorus]], and the [[Weird Sisters|three witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', as they would sit in the [[The snug|snug bar]] of [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]], passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.<ref>Tinker. p. 31.</ref> Headstrong Ena often clashed with [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Pat Phoenix]]), whom she believed espoused a dauntlessly loose set of morals. Elsie resented Ena's interference and gossip, which most of the time had little basis in reality.\n\nIn April 1961, [[Jed Stone]] ([[Kenneth Cope]]) made his first appearance and returned the following year in 1962. He left in 1963, but returned three years later in 1966. He left again and then returned 42 years later in 2008.\n\nIn March 1961, ''Coronation Street'' reached No. 1 in the [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|television ratings]] and remained there for the rest of the year.<ref name=\"littlepg10\"/> Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15&nbsp;million) tuned into ''Corrie'', and by 1964 the programme had over 20&nbsp;million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on 2 December 1964, at 21.36&nbsp;million viewers.<ref>Little (1995). p. 35.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=BFI Most Watched 1960s |work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html |accessdate=29 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223181243/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html |archivedate=23 February 2007  }}</ref>\n\nStorylines throughout the decade included Elsie's mystery poison-pen letter, the 1962 marriage of Ken and [[Valerie Barlow|Valerie Tatlock]] ([[Anne Reid]]), [[Storylines of Coronation Street#Killing of Martha Longhurst|the death of Martha Longhurst]] in 1964, the birth of the Barlow twins in 1965, Elsie Tanner's wedding to [[Steve Tanner (Coronation Street)|Steve Tanner]] ([[Paul Maxwell (actor)|Paul Maxwell]]) and a train crashing from the viaduct (both in 1967), Steve Tanner's murder in 1968, and a coach crash in 1969.\n\nIn spite of rising popularity with viewers, ''Coronation Street'' was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban working class, and its representation of a community that was a [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] fantasy.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert C|last=Allen|title=Soap Opera|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|accessdate=7 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050523235035/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|archivedate=23 May 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref> After the first episode in 1960, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' printed: \"The programme is doomed from the outset&nbsp;...

Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including [[Lucille Hewitt]] ([[Jennifer Moss (actress)|Jennifer Moss]]) becoming addicted to drugs, [[Jerry Booth (Coronation Street)|Jerry Booth]] ([[Graham Haberfield]]) being in a storyline about homosexuality, [[Emily Nugent]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) having an out-of-wedlock child, and introducing a black family, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.<ref>Little.

(2000) p.86.</ref> The audience of ITV's other flagship soap opera ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' increased markedly at this time, as its established cast, such as Meg Richardson ([[Noele Gordon]]), grew in popularity.<ref name=\"littlepg86\"/> These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background. The roles of [[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]), [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Hunt]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]), [[Mavis Wilton|Mavis Riley]] ([[Thelma Barlow]]) and [[Ivy Tilsley|Ivy Tyldesley]] ([[Lynne Perrie]]) were built up between 1972 and 1973 (with Perrie's character being renamed to the better-known \"Tilsley\"), and characters such as [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Potter]] ([[Helen Worth]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Patricia Cutts]]/[[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]), and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Liz Dawn]]) first appearing in 1974. These characters would remain at the centre of the programme for many years.<ref name = \"fsobxi\">Little. (2000) p.93.</ref><ref>Little.

(1995) p.131.</ref> ''Coronation Street's'' stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens' lodger, Gail Potter and [[Suzie Birchall]] ([[Cheryl Murray]]) moved in with Elsie, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff: Bet Lynch, Fred Gee and [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Turpin]] ([[Betty Driver]]).\n\nStorylines throughout the decade included a warehouse fire in 1975, the birth of [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy Langton]] in 1977, the murder of [[Ernest Bishop]] ([[Stephen Hancock]]) in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of Gail to [[Brian Tilsley]] ([[Christopher Quinten]]) (also in 1979).\n\nFor eleven weeks, between August and October 1979, [[industrial action]] forced ''Coronation Street'' and the entire ITV network (apart from the [[Channel Islands]]) off the air. When ITV did return, its first evening schedule included a special \"catch-up\" edition of ''Coronation Street''. This included storylines which would have taken place during the strike, and they were explained in the form of a narrative chat between Bet Lynch and popular character [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]). For several weeks the channel had very few fresh episodes to show, and episodes of the game show ''[[3-2-1]]'' were screened in its place. ''Coronation Street'' returned to ITV screens with a regular scheduled time closer to the end of 1979.\n\n''Coronation Street'' had little competition within its prime time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially viable storylines and again presenting a dated view of working class life.<ref>Liddement. (2004)</ref>\n\n===1980s===\nBetween 1980 and 1989, ''Coronation Street'' underwent some of the biggest changes since its launch. By May 1984, [[William Roache]] ([[Ken Barlow]]) stood as the only original [[cast member]], after the departures of [[Violet Carson]] ([[Ena Sharples]]) in 1980, [[Doris Speed]] ([[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]) in 1983, and both [[Pat Phoenix]] ([[Elsie Tanner]]) and [[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]] ([[Albert Tatlock]]) in 1984.<ref>Little.

(1995) p.171.</ref> The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady. In 1983, [[Shirley Armitage]] (Lisa Lewis) became the first major black character in her role as machinist at Baldwin's Casuals.<ref name=\"little172\"/>\n\nKen Barlow married [[Deirdre Langton]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) on 27 July 1981. The episode was watched by over 15&nbsp;million viewers&nbsp;\u2013 more ITV viewers than the wedding of [[Prince Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] two days later.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JWu5CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=ken+deirdre+wedding+1981+15+million+viewer+source |work=Google Books |title=Two weddings to Ken |accessdate=14 May 2018|isbn=9781780894898 |last1=Young |first1=Glenda |date=22 October 2015 }}</ref> In the 1980s relationships were cemented between established characters: [[Alf Roberts]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]) married [[Audrey Roberts|Audrey Potter]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) in 1985; [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) married [[Sally Webster|Sally Seddon]] ([[Sally Dynevor|Sally Whittaker]]) in 1986;<ref>Little.

(1995) pp.184, 189.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the arrival of [[Channel 4]], and its edgy new soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'', was one of the biggest changes for ''Coronation Street''. Unlike ''Coronation Street'', which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, ''Brookside'' brought together working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting, and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in ''Coronation Street'' were largely about family affairs, ''Brookside'' concentrated on social affairs such as [[industrial action]], unemployment, and the [[black market]]. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 1985.<ref name=\"littlepg165\">Little. (2000) p.165.</ref> Like ''Brookside'', ''EastEnders'' had a more gritty premise than ''Coronation Street'', although unlike ''Brookside'' it tended to steer clear of blue language and politicised stories.\n\nWhile ratings for ''Coronation Street'' remained consistent throughout the decade, ''[[EastEnders]]'' regularly obtained higher viewing figures due to its omnibus episodes shown at weekends.<ref>Little. (2000) p.170.</ref> The ''Coronation Street'' episode broadcast on 2 January 1985 attracted 21.40 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode in the shows history based on a single showing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/britains-most-watched-tv-show-of-last-80-years-revealed-10639498 |work=Sky News |title=Britain's most watched TV show of last 80 years |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> Subsequent episodes would achieve higher figures when the original broadcast and omnibus edition figures were combined. With prime time competition, ''Corrie'' was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being a failure with viewers.<ref name=\"littlepg165\" /> Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer [[David Liddiment]]. A new exterior set had been built in 1982, and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed with a new studio being built, and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved the show from being shot on film to [[videotape]] in 1988.<ref name=\"littlepg188\">Little. (2000) p.188.</ref> Due to new pressures, an introduction of the third weekly episode aired on 20 October 1989, to broadcast each Friday at 7:30&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"littlepg188\"/>\n\nThe 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as Deirdre Barlow's affair with [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention.<ref>Little. (1995) p.165.</ref> The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, [[Susan Barlow|Susan]] ([[Wendy Jane Walker]]). In 1986, there was a fire at the Rovers Return. The episode that aired on 25 December 1987, attracted a combined audience (original and omnibus) of 26.65&nbsp;million \u2013 a figure helped by the fact that this episode heralded the departure of immensely-popular character [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]). Between 1986 and 1989, the story of [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]]'s ([[Barbara Knox]]) [[psychological abuse]] at the hands of [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), and then his subsequent death under the wheels of a [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool tram]], was played out. This storyline gave the show its highest combined viewing figure in its history with 26.93&nbsp;million for the episode that aired on 15 (and 19) March 1989, where Alan is hiding from the police after trying to kill Rita in the previous episode. This rating is sometimes incorrectly credited to the 8 December 1989 tram death episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/television/tv-by-decade/tv-shows-1980s/1980s-television-introduction/ |work=Nostalgia Central |title=1980s Television |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> Other stories included the birth of [[Nick Tilsley|Nicky Tilsley]] ([[Warren Jackson]]) in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and [[Stan Ogden]]'s funeral in 1984, the birth of [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Tilsley]] (Lynsay King) in 1987, and [[Brian Tilsley]]'s murder in 1989.\n\nNew characters were introduced, such as [[Terry Duckworth]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]), [[Curly Watts]] ([[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]]), [[Martin Platt]] ([[Sean Wilson (actor)|Sean Wilson]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]), and the McDonald family; one of whom, [[Simon Gregson]], started on the show as [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]] a week after his 15th birthday, and has been on the show ever since.\n\n===1990s===\nIn spite of updated sets and production changes, ''Coronation Street'' still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Council]], [[Lord Rees-Mogg]], criticised the low representation of [[minority group|ethnic minorities]], and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as \"''Coronation Street'' shuts out blacks\" (''[[The Times]]''), and \"'Put colour in t'Street\" (''Daily Mirror'').<ref>Little. (1995) p.217.</ref> [[Patrick Stoddart]] of ''The Times'' wrote: \"The millions who watch ''Coronation Street''&nbsp;\u2013 and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg&nbsp;\u2013 know real life when they see it&nbsp;... in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen\".<ref>Little. (2000) p.205.</ref> Black and Asian characters had appeared, but it was not until 1999 that the show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family. There was also an Irish Traveller family who made a brief appearance for 4 episodes \u2013 spear headed by famous Irish actress Rachael McCrudden who played the part of Josie Joyce and her husband Conor McCrudden ( Jonjo Joyce). They were written off after they went on a rampage of drinking Dutch Gold and were caught by police after holding up the local Des Kelly carpets looking for wet finish Lino.\n\nNew characters [[Des Barnes|Des]] ([[Philip Middlemiss]]) and Steph Barnes ([[Amelia Bullmore]]) moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as [[Yuppie]]s.<ref>Little.

The amount of [[slapstick]] and physical humour in storylines increased during the 1990s, with comical characters such as [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]) and his water bed.<ref>Little. (1995) p.220.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s storylines included the death of newborn Katie McDonald in 1992, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) wedding to [[Alma Sedgewick]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]) in 1992, [[Tommy Duckworth]] being sold by his father [[Terry Duckworth|Terry]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]) in 1993, [[Deirdre Barlow]]'s ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) marriage to Moroccan [[Samir Rachid]] ([[Al Nedjari]]), and the rise of [[Tanya Pooley]] ([[Eva Pope]]) between 1993 and 1994.\n\nIn 1995, [[Julie Goodyear]] ([[Bet Lynch]]) left the show. She made brief return appearances in 1999, 2002 and 2003.\n\nIn 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day, he cut the characters of [[Derek Wilton]] ([[Peter Baldwin (actor)|Peter Baldwin]]), [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street Character)|Don Brennan]] ([[Geoffrey Hinsliff]]), [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]), [[Bill Webster]] ([[Peter Armitage]]), [[Billy Williams (Coronation Street)|Billy Williams]] ([[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]]) and [[Maureen Holdsworth]] ([[Sherrie Hewson]]).<ref name=\"littlepg235\">Little.

The production team lost some of its key writers when Barry Hill, Adele Rose and Julian Roach all resigned as well.<ref name=\"littlepg235\"/>\n\nIn line with Park's suggestion, younger characters were introduced: Nick Tilsley was recast, played by [[Adam Rickitt]], [[single parent|single mother]] [[Zoe Tattersall]] ([[Joanne Froggatt]]) first appeared, and the Battersbys moved into No.5. Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as drug dealers, eco-warriors, religious cults, and a transsexual woman.<ref name=\"little241\">Little.

Having received criticism of being too out of touch, ''Corrie'' now struggled to emulate the more modern ''Brookside'' and ''EastEnders''.

''Corrie'' continued to struggle in the ratings, with ''EastEnders'' introducing some of its strongest stories. In 2002, Kieran Roberts was appointed as producer and aimed to re-introduce \"gentle storylines and humour\", after deciding that ''the Street'' should not try to compete with other soaps.<ref name=CNProd/> In 2002, [[Gail Platt]] ([[Helen Worth]]) married [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]), a [[financial adviser|financial advisor]] who would go on to leave [[Duggie Ferguson]] ([[John Bowe (actor)|John Bowe]]) to die; murder both his ex-wife [[Patricia Hillman|Patricia]] ([[Annabelle Apsion]]) and local neighbour [[Maxine Peacock]] ([[Tracy Shaw]]); and attempt to kill both his mother-in-law [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) and her longtime friend, [[Emily Bishop]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]).

Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off before the end of the 1970s, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series.

In the end, suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like [[BBC1]], the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.\n\nThe ITV network, like [[BBC1]], began full colour transmissions on 15 November 1969.

For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week.\"<ref>Tinker. pp. 12\u201313.</ref> By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the ''1950s''. Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including [[Lucille Hewitt]] ([[Jennifer Moss (actress)|Jennifer Moss]]) becoming addicted to drugs, [[Jerry Booth (Coronation Street)|Jerry Booth]] ([[Graham Haberfield]]) being in a storyline about homosexuality, [[Emily Nugent]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) having an out-of-wedlock child, and introducing a black family, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.<ref>Little.

(2000) p.86.</ref> The audience of ITV's other flagship soap opera ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' increased markedly at this time, as its established cast, such as Meg Richardson ([[Noele Gordon]]), grew in popularity.<ref name=\"littlepg86\"/> These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background. The roles of [[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]), [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Hunt]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]), [[Mavis Wilton|Mavis Riley]] ([[Thelma Barlow]]) and [[Ivy Tilsley|Ivy Tyldesley]] ([[Lynne Perrie]]) were built up between 1972 and 1973 (with Perrie's character being renamed to the better-known \"Tilsley\"), and characters such as [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Potter]] ([[Helen Worth]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Patricia Cutts]]/[[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]), and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Liz Dawn]]) first appearing in 1974. These characters would remain at the centre of the programme for many years.<ref name = \"fsobxi\">Little. (2000) p.93.</ref><ref>Little. (2000) p.79.</ref>\n\nComic storylines had been popular in the series in the 1960s, but had become sparse during the early 1970s. These were re-introduced by new producer [[Bill Podmore]] who joined the series in 1976. He had worked on Granada comedy productions prior to his appointment.<ref>Little. (2000) p.107.</ref> [[Stan Ogden|Stan]] ([[Bernard Youens]]) and [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]) were often at the centre of overtly funny storylines, with other comic characters including [[Eddie Yeats]] ([[Geoffrey Hughes]]), [[Fred Gee]] ([[Fred Feast]]), and [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[Bill Tarmey]]) all making their first appearances during the decade.\n\nIn 1976, Pat Phoenix returned to her role as Elsie Tanner and, after a spate of ill health, Violet Carson returned on a more regular basis as Ena.<ref>Little. (1995) p.131.</ref> ''Coronation Street's'' stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens' lodger, Gail Potter and [[Suzie Birchall]] ([[Cheryl Murray]]) moved in with Elsie, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff: Bet Lynch, Fred Gee and [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Turpin]] ([[Betty Driver]]).\n\nStorylines throughout the decade included a warehouse fire in 1975, the birth of [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy Langton]] in 1977, the murder of [[Ernest Bishop]] ([[Stephen Hancock]]) in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of Gail to [[Brian Tilsley]] ([[Christopher Quinten]]) (also in 1979).\n\nFor eleven weeks, between August and October 1979, [[industrial action]] forced ''Coronation Street'' and the entire ITV network (apart from the [[Channel Islands]]) off the air. When ITV did return, its first evening schedule included a special \"catch-up\" edition of ''Coronation Street''. This included storylines which would have taken place during the strike, and they were explained in the form of a narrative chat between Bet Lynch and popular character [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]). For several weeks the channel had very few fresh episodes to show, and episodes of the game show ''[[3-2-1]]'' were screened in its place. ''Coronation Street'' returned to ITV screens with a regular scheduled time closer to the end of 1979.\n\n''Coronation Street'' had little competition within its prime time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially viable storylines and again presenting a dated view of working class life.<ref>Liddement. (2004)</ref>\n\n===1980s===\nBetween 1980 and 1989, ''Coronation Street'' underwent some of the biggest changes since its launch. By May 1984, [[William Roache]] ([[Ken Barlow]]) stood as the only original [[cast member]], after the departures of [[Violet Carson]] ([[Ena Sharples]]) in 1980, [[Doris Speed]] ([[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]) in 1983, and both [[Pat Phoenix]] ([[Elsie Tanner]]) and [[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]] ([[Albert Tatlock]]) in 1984.<ref>Little.

(1995) p.162.</ref><ref>Little. (1995) p.171.</ref> The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady. In 1983, [[Shirley Armitage]] (Lisa Lewis) became the first major black character in her role as machinist at Baldwin's Casuals.<ref name=\"little172\"/>\n\nKen Barlow married [[Deirdre Langton]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) on 27 July 1981. The episode was watched by over 15&nbsp;million viewers&nbsp;\u2013 more ITV viewers than the wedding of [[Prince Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] two days later.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JWu5CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=ken+deirdre+wedding+1981+15+million+viewer+source |work=Google Books |title=Two weddings to Ken |accessdate=14 May 2018|isbn=9781780894898 |last1=Young |first1=Glenda |date=22 October 2015 }}</ref> In the 1980s relationships were cemented between established characters: [[Alf Roberts]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]) married [[Audrey Roberts|Audrey Potter]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) in 1985; [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) married [[Sally Webster|Sally Seddon]] ([[Sally Dynevor|Sally Whittaker]]) in 1986;<ref>Little.

(1995) pp.184, 189.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the arrival of [[Channel 4]], and its edgy new soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'', was one of the biggest changes for ''Coronation Street''. Unlike ''Coronation Street'', which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, ''Brookside'' brought together working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting, and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in ''Coronation Street'' were largely about family affairs, ''Brookside'' concentrated on social affairs such as [[industrial action]], unemployment, and the [[black market]]. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 1985.<ref name=\"littlepg165\">Little. (2000) p.165.</ref> Like ''Brookside'', ''EastEnders'' had a more gritty premise than ''Coronation Street'', although unlike ''Brookside'' it tended to steer clear of blue language and politicised stories.\n\nWhile ratings for ''Coronation Street'' remained consistent throughout the decade, ''[[EastEnders]]'' regularly obtained higher viewing figures due to its omnibus episodes shown at weekends.<ref>Little. (2000) p.170.</ref> The ''Coronation Street'' episode broadcast on 2 January 1985 attracted 21.40 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode in the shows history based on a single showing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/britains-most-watched-tv-show-of-last-80-years-revealed-10639498 |work=Sky News |title=Britain's most watched TV show of last 80 years |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> Subsequent episodes would achieve higher figures when the original broadcast and omnibus edition figures were combined. With prime time competition, ''Corrie'' was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being a failure with viewers.<ref name=\"littlepg165\" /> Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer [[David Liddiment]]. A new exterior set had been built in 1982, and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed with a new studio being built, and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved the show from being shot on film to [[videotape]] in 1988.<ref name=\"littlepg188\">Little. (2000) p.188.</ref> Due to new pressures, an introduction of the third weekly episode aired on 20 October 1989, to broadcast each Friday at 7:30&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"littlepg188\"/>\n\nThe 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as Deirdre Barlow's affair with [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention.<ref>Little. (1995) p.165.</ref> The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, [[Susan Barlow|Susan]] ([[Wendy Jane Walker]]). In 1986, there was a fire at the Rovers Return. The episode that aired on 25 December 1987, attracted a combined audience (original and omnibus) of 26.65&nbsp;million \u2013 a figure helped by the fact that this episode heralded the departure of immensely-popular character [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]). Between 1986 and 1989, the story of [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]]'s ([[Barbara Knox]]) [[psychological abuse]] at the hands of [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), and then his subsequent death under the wheels of a [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool tram]], was played out. This storyline gave the show its highest combined viewing figure in its history with 26.93&nbsp;million for the episode that aired on 15 (and 19) March 1989, where Alan is hiding from the police after trying to kill Rita in the previous episode. This rating is sometimes incorrectly credited to the 8 December 1989 tram death episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/television/tv-by-decade/tv-shows-1980s/1980s-television-introduction/ |work=Nostalgia Central |title=1980s Television |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> Other stories included the birth of [[Nick Tilsley|Nicky Tilsley]] ([[Warren Jackson]]) in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and [[Stan Ogden]]'s funeral in 1984, the birth of [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Tilsley]] (Lynsay King) in 1987, and [[Brian Tilsley]]'s murder in 1989.\n\nNew characters were introduced, such as [[Terry Duckworth]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]), [[Curly Watts]] ([[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]]), [[Martin Platt]] ([[Sean Wilson (actor)|Sean Wilson]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]), and the McDonald family; one of whom, [[Simon Gregson]], started on the show as [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]] a week after his 15th birthday, and has been on the show ever since.\n\n===1990s===\nIn spite of updated sets and production changes, ''Coronation Street'' still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Council]], [[Lord Rees-Mogg]], criticised the low representation of [[minority group|ethnic minorities]], and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as \"''Coronation Street'' shuts out blacks\" (''[[The Times]]''), and \"'Put colour in t'Street\" (''Daily Mirror'').<ref>Little. (1995) p.217.</ref> [[Patrick Stoddart]] of ''The Times'' wrote: \"The millions who watch ''Coronation Street''&nbsp;\u2013 and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg&nbsp;\u2013 know real life when they see it&nbsp;... in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen\".<ref>Little. (2000) p.205.</ref> Black and Asian characters had appeared, but it was not until 1999 that the show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family. There was also an Irish Traveller family who made a brief appearance for 4 episodes \u2013 spear headed by famous Irish actress Rachael McCrudden who played the part of Josie Joyce and her husband Conor McCrudden ( Jonjo Joyce). They were written off after they went on a rampage of drinking Dutch Gold and were caught by police after holding up the local Des Kelly carpets looking for wet finish Lino.\n\nNew characters [[Des Barnes|Des]] ([[Philip Middlemiss]]) and Steph Barnes ([[Amelia Bullmore]]) moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as [[Yuppie]]s.<ref>Little.

The amount of [[slapstick]] and physical humour in storylines increased during the 1990s, with comical characters such as [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]) and his water bed.<ref>Little. (1995) p.220.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s storylines included the death of newborn Katie McDonald in 1992, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) wedding to [[Alma Sedgewick]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]) in 1992, [[Tommy Duckworth]] being sold by his father [[Terry Duckworth|Terry]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]) in 1993, [[Deirdre Barlow]]'s ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) marriage to Moroccan [[Samir Rachid]] ([[Al Nedjari]]), and the rise of [[Tanya Pooley]] ([[Eva Pope]]) between 1993 and 1994.\n\nIn 1995, [[Julie Goodyear]] ([[Bet Lynch]]) left the show. She made brief return appearances in 1999, 2002 and 2003.\n\nIn 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day, he cut the characters of [[Derek Wilton]] ([[Peter Baldwin (actor)|Peter Baldwin]]), [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street Character)|Don Brennan]] ([[Geoffrey Hinsliff]]), [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]), [[Bill Webster]] ([[Peter Armitage]]), [[Billy Williams (Coronation Street)|Billy Williams]] ([[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]]) and [[Maureen Holdsworth]] ([[Sherrie Hewson]]).<ref name=\"littlepg235\">Little.

The production team lost some of its key writers when Barry Hill, Adele Rose and Julian Roach all resigned as well.<ref name=\"littlepg235\"/>\n\nIn line with Park's suggestion, younger characters were introduced: Nick Tilsley was recast, played by [[Adam Rickitt]], [[single parent|single mother]] [[Zoe Tattersall]] ([[Joanne Froggatt]]) first appeared, and the Battersbys moved into No.5. Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as drug dealers, eco-warriors, religious cults, and a transsexual woman.<ref name=\"little241\">Little.

Having received criticism of being too out of touch, ''Corrie'' now struggled to emulate the more modern ''Brookside'' and ''EastEnders''.

Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off before the end of the 1970s, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series. In 2011, [[Dennis Tanner]] ([[Philip Lowrie]]), another character from the first episode, returned to ''Coronation Street'' after a 43-year absence. Since 1984, Ken Barlow has been the show's only remaining original character. Emily Bishop ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) had appeared in the series since late-January 1961, when the show was just weeks old, and was the show's longest-serving female character before she departed on 1 January 2016.

Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran such as [[Albert Tatlock]] ([[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]), [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]) and [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]), the bumbling retail manager like [[Leonard Swindley]] ([[Arthur Lowe]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]), [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]), quick-tempered, tough tradesmen like [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]), [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]] ([[Charles Lawson]]), [[Tommy Harris (Coronation Street)|Tommy Harris]] ([[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]]) and [[Owen Armstrong]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]), and the perennial losers such as Stan and Hilda, Jack and Vera, [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), [[Beth Tinker]] ([[Lisa George]]) and [[Kirk Sutherland]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]).<ref name=\"littlepg7\">Little.

The show's former archivist and scriptwriter [[Daran Little]] disagreed with the characterisation of the show as a collection of stereotypes. \"Rather, remember that Elsie, Ena and others were the first of their kind ever seen on British television.

Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This instalment featured the street's residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the end, suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like [[BBC1]], the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.\n\nThe ITV network, like [[BBC1]], began full colour transmissions on 15 November 1969.

[[Quilt]]s have been produced for centuries, as utilitarian blankets, decorations, family heirlooms, and now treasured museum collections objects. Quilts are three-layered textile pieces with a decorated top, a back, and a filler in the middle. The composite nature of these objects creates an interesting challenge for their conservation, as the separate layers can be made of different textile materials, multiple colors, and therefore, varying degrees of wear, tear, and damage.\n\n== What is a Quilt? ==\nA quilt is a multi-layered textile, traditionally composed of three layers of fiber: a woven cloth top, a layer of [[Padding|batting]] or wadding, and a woven back, combined using the technique of [[quilting]], the process of sewing the three layers together.\n\nThe pattern of stitching can be the key decorative element if a single piece of fabric is used for the top of a quilt (a \"wholecloth quilt\"), but in many cases the top is pieced from a [[patchwork]] of smaller fabric pieces; and the pattern and color of these pieces will be important to the design.<ref>{{Citation|title=Quilt|date=2019-04-23|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quilt&oldid=893802879|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref> Patterns, fabric, and styles differ greatly based on the time period and area that they were produced in. [[The Quilts of Gee's Bend|The quilts produced]] in [[Boykin, Alabama|Gee's Bend]], Alabama are great examples of the history and use of quilts in specific space and time.\n\n[[Quilting]] is the process of sewing two or more layers of [[Textile|fabric]] together to make a thicker padded material, usually to create a [[quilt]] or quilted garment. The process of quilting uses a [[Sewing needle|needle]] and [[Yarn|thread]] to join two or more layers of material to make a quilt. The quilter's hand or [[sewing machine]] passes the needle and thread through all layers and then brings the needle back up. The process is repeated across the entire area where quilting is wanted.<ref>{{Citation|title=Quilting|date=2019-03-10|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quilting&oldid=887104328|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Composition===\n\nQuilting, sewing together layers of fabric to create a cohesive whole, has been around for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. Europe, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States all have examples of quilts that are hundreds of years old.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quilting |title = History of quilting}}</ref> Depending on the time period and area that they were produced in, quilts can be made of varying textiles, have a myriad of different colors, and be pieced together using different methods. Some quilts produced in the [[Civil war|Civil War]] era were created using [[silk |silk ribbons.]] Silk material such as these ribbons often suffer from what is referred to as \"shattering,\" caused by metal salts that were applied to silk fabrics to create desired \"[[The Rustle of Silk|rustles]]\" in women's dresses, and were used as a weighting agent in these dresses.<ref>Benner, J. (2014). \"Conserving Shattered Silk in an Early 20th Century Souvenir Ribbon Quilt.\"  The Denver Art Museum.</ref> The metal components do considerable damage to silk fabric over time. Quilts containing metal salts formed a minority of these objects, however, they provide an example of the types of features to be identified when considering treatment. The Minnesota Historical Society has some guidelines for preserving quilts that include insights such as looking for deterioration issues due to certain [[fabric]] types such as silk as well as specific [[dyes]].<ref name=\":1\">Bede, D. (1997). Preserving Historic Quilts. Minnesota History Interpreter, 3-6. Retrieved from http://www.mnhs.org/sites/default/files/lhs/techtalk/techtalkseptember1997.pdf.</ref>  In the twenty-first century, quilts are frequently displayed as non-utilitarian works of art, but historically quilts were often used as bed covers. The use of quilts as bedcovers persists today.\n\n===Processes/Techniques===\n\nAfter their creation, the use and production style of quilts varied; initially a utilitarian product used mostly for bed coverings, quilts have evolved to become decorative pieces as well.<ref>History of Quilts. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.quilting-in-america.com/History-of-Quilts.html</ref> Due to the changing uses of these items, techniques for creating them have evolved over the last few centuries. Some common historical and current quilting techniques include the following:\n\n* Patchwork & Piecing\n** One of the primary techniques involved in quilt making is patchwork, sewing together geometric pieces of fabric often to form a design or \"block.\" Also called piecing, this technique can be achieved with hand stitching or with a sewing machine.<ref>International Quilt Study Center & Museum (2013). \"Patchwork.\" World Quilts: The American Story. Retrieved April 23, 2019.</ref>\n* Applique\n**[[Appliqu\u00e9]] is a sewing technique where an upper layer of fabric is sewn onto a ground fabric.<ref name=\":4\">{{Citation|title=Quilt|date=2019-04-23|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quilt&oldid=893802879|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n* Reverse Applique\n** Reverse appliqu\u00e9 is a sewing technique where a ground fabric is cut, another piece of fabric is placed under the ground fabric, the raw edges of the ground fabric are tucked under, and the newly folded edge is sewn down to the lower fabric. Stitches are made as inconspicuous as possible.<ref name=\":4\" />\n* Quilting\n** Quilting, typically a running stitch, can be achieved by hand or by sewing machine. Hand quilting has often been a communally productive act with quilters sitting around a large quilting frame.<ref name=\":4\" />\n* Trapunto\n**[[Trapunto quilting|Trapunto]] is a sewing technique where two layers of fabric surrounding a layer of batting are quilted together, and then additional material is added to a portion of the design to increase the profile of relief as compared to the rest of the work.<ref name=\":4\" />\n* Embellishment\n** Additional decorative elements may be added to the surface of a quilt to create a three-dimensional or whimsical effect. The most common objects sewn on are beads or buttons. Decorative trim, [[Piping (sewing)|piping]], [[sequin]]s, found objects, or other items can also be secured to the surface.<ref name=\":4\" />\n* English Paper Piecing\n** English [[Foundation piecing|paper piecing]] is a hand-sewing technique used to maximize accuracy when piecing complex angles together. A paper shape is cut with the exact dimensions of the desired piece. Fabric is then basted to the paper shape. Adjacent units are then placed face to face, and the seam is [[Blanket stitch|whipstitch]]<nowiki/>ed together. When a given piece is completely surrounded by all the adjacent shapes, the basting thread is cut, and the basting and the paper shape are removed.<ref name=\":4\" /><nowiki/>\n* Foundation Piecing\n**[[Foundation piecing]] is a sewing technique that allows maximum stability of the work as the piecing is created, minimizing the distorting effect of working with slender pieces or bias-cut pieces.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Conservation and Restoration Science==\n\nThe conservation and use of all materials in a museum should be balanced to suit the object and the public. Best practices for the conservation/restoration of items start with the identification of the materials the item is constructed of.  This identification allows [[conservation scientist]]s to effectively treat and preserve the items for future generations. Though referred to my many names, (i.e. conservation scientists, cultural heritage scientists, etc.) these museum professionals have very specific skill sets using knowledge in [[Physical Science|physical science]], [[forensics]], the [[humanities]], [[engineering]], [[computer science]], and [[economics]]. Conservation scientists use the skills they developed in these fields to conserve/restore objects from a wide array of [[museum]] areas including; [[statues]], [[Historic site|historical sites]], [[paper]], and [[textiles]]. As a composite textile, quilts require special consideration. The environment that they are stored in is one basic factor to consider. Being a single piece composed of possibly multiple different fabrics; all of the different fabrics' compositions need to be considered for conservation, storage, display, and treatment purposes. The large size of quilts requires special attention as well, specifically during handling, storage, and display. Due to the fragile nature of textiles, trained professionals are often the best choice to decide on the necessity of repairs and to perform them.\n\n==Agents of Deterioration==\n\nFor the most part, all objects are susceptible to forces (agents of deterioration) that cause them to decay over the course of time through chemical, physical, biological deterioration, or some combination of the three. As with most of these objects, [[Collections care|preventive conservation]] is one of the cornerstones to maintaining quilts for future generations. Through understanding the different agents of deterioration and examining the greatest threat to the objects, the museum can develop a plan to mitigate these risks. As a composite textile often containing different colors, quilts are vulnerable to [[light]].  Overexposure to light can change the colors and strength of the fabrics within them.<ref name=\"culturalheritage.org\">The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). (n.d.). Caring for your Treasures. Retrieved from https://www.culturalheritage.org/website-search-results?indexCatalogue=site-search&searchQuery=textile&wordsMode=0</ref> Light is not the only agent that affects textiles such as quilts; composed of [[organic materials]], they contain [[carbon]], are susceptible to [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]] levels, may absorb water, and can even become homes for [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and sources of food for [[pest (organism)|pest]]s.<ref name=\"NPS 2012\">NPS. 2012. National Park Service: Museum Handbook. Part One. Chapter 4. 4:7 \u2013 4:10, and, 4:16 (D) - 4:20</ref> Quilts, and textiles in general, can be sensitive to [[chemicals]], [[dust]], [[dirt]], [[oils]], [[smoke]], [[stain]]s, [[perfume]], and even excessive washing.<ref name=\":2\">Beginning Quilt Restoration. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.whitebluffscenter.org/index.php?ID=27</ref> Susceptible to all of these agents, quilts can undergo changes that may cause discernible damage. According to the National Parks Service Museum Handbook, 2012, \"chemical changes in textiles caused by interaction with light also weaken the fabric so that physical damage such as rips and tears are more likely to occur.\"<ref name=\"NPS 2012\"/> To create more habitable environments for quilts, conservators can cycle each specimen in and out of lighted areas and storage, monitor RH and temperature levels, seal them in individual cases created for them, and more. Preventive conservation is an extremely important tool in the conservators handbook, giving them agency beyond restoration and ideally giving them more control over the natural process of deterioration that is impossible to halt completely.[[File:International Quilt Study Center & Museum Quilts in Common Exhibition.jpg|thumb|[[International Quilt Study Center & Museum]] Quilts Exhibition]]\n\n===Light===\n\n* Light is necessary to view objects in museums, but can cause quite a bit of damage if quilts are left exposed. Ultraviolet radiation and visible light can each affect textile materials such as quilts. Light can cause [[fading]], darkening, [[yellowing]], [[embrittlement]], [[stiffening]], and more.<ref name=\"NPS 2012\"/> Many museums utilize motion activated lights and rotating displays to mitigate the effects of light on objects.\n\n===Relative humidity and temperature===\n\n* Relative humidity refers to the amount of moisture in the air. Fluctuations in moisture can cause textile materials to expand and contract at different rates and can also promote mold, [[mildew]], [[corrosion]], and bleeding of dyes.<ref name=\"culturalheritage.org\"/>\n* Much as with incorrect relative humidity, the presence of water can cause mold, mildew, bleeding of dyes, and further damage to quilts.\n* High and low temperatures and temperature fluctuations can case damage to the different textiles in quilts. High temperatures can speed up chemical reactions and cause damage to fibers and dyes.<ref name=\"culturalheritage.org\"/>\n\n===Pollutants===\n\n* [[Pollutants]] may be many things including dirt, grease, ash, soot, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, and ozone.<ref name=\":3\" /> Many of these pollutants/contaminants may cause issues with textiles such as quilts, especially in the case of certain composite quilts or those made with silks that have metals included. Common pollutants that may affect textiles such as quilts include; [[Sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]] which react with cotton, linen, and [[viscose]] materials and can cause them to discolor and become weak and brittle.<ref>Museums Galleries Scotland - Reducing air pollution. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.museumsgalleriesscotland.org.uk/advice/collections/identifying-and-reducing-air-pollution/</ref>\n\n===Physical forces, fire, and pests===\n\n*Physical forces can include shock, vibration, abrasion, and more that can cause cumulative damage.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/mhi/mhi.pdf|title=National Parks Service Museum Handbook|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Quilts are often touched by visitors which can cause physical damage as well as imparting oils, creams, and [[salts]] from hands.

If quilts are exposed to fire, they can be charred, destroyed, embrittled, scorched, or even harbor smoke.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* Pests, mainly insects and rodents, can damage quilts through consumption, perforation, cutting, grazing, tunneling, weakening, disfiguring, and more.<ref name=\":3\" /> Throughout history, quilts have been made of many different types of materials.  If they are made of animal based, [[synthetic fibers|synthetic]], or plant based textiles materials, different pests can be attracted to them. Most quilts are made of [[cotton]] or [[linen]], though [[silk]] is also an option. [[Silverfish]], [[carpet beetles]], and [[moths]] are all common pests that can damage quilts.<ref>Museum Textile Service. (n.d.). Category: Pests. Retrieved from http://www.museumtextiles.com/blog/category/pests</ref>\n* Disassociation, often the mishandling or misfiling of objects, can become a problem especially in museums that have multiple quilts and do not keep good records on them. One could be forgotten about, not recorded as moved, or lost entirely.\n\n[[File:Crazy Quilt, 1884.jpg|thumb|This quilt, created in 1884, is being held at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. Composed of velvet and silk, this piece requires careful thought when conserving/restoring it.]]\n\n==Preventive Conservation==\n\nDirect treatment may be necessary for some objects in a museum but, for many others, preventive conservation is often considered the best course of action. Preventive conservation, sometimes called collections care, involves any actions taken to prevent or delay the deterioration of cultural heritage. The primary goal is to identify and reduce potential hazards to heritage with thoughtful control of their surroundings.<ref>Collections care. (2019, February 22). Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collections_care</ref> Preventive conservation utilizes [[environmental monitoring]] and regulation to create the ideal space for objects. The aim is to reduce deterioration; this method can be used for most items in museums including quilts.<ref>The Field Museum. (2018, June 14). Preventive Conservation. Retrieved from https://www.fieldmuseum.org/science/research/area/conserving-collections/preventive-conservation</ref> If preventive conservation options run out, then treatment by a professional can commence. Conservation treatment becomes necessary when there is damage from the absence of preventive care, with improper care, other issues, or even with inherently unstable objects.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Environment===\nThe correct storage of textiles such as quilts is important for their long-term safety. Light, temperature, and humidity are the main factors that impact a textile's deterioration rate. Pests, chemicals, and pollutants may also damage quilts in storage and display environments.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_and_restoration_of_textiles#Environment|title=Conservation and Restoration of Textiles|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Conservators monitor and evaluate museum environments to ensure the longevity of objects stored within. Besides monitoring for pests, chemicals, pollutants, light and humidity levels by themselves, these museum professionals check for any other visible signs and causes of deterioration.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Storage===\nQuilts and other similar textiles can be stored in more than one way. The prerequisites for all storage environments include a clean, dark, cool, and dry space with constant temperature and relative humidity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Flat storage such as shelves and drawers may be used for smaller quilts, but for larger quilts, rolled storage may become necessary. Best practices for storage of quilts include; rolling quilts around acid-free or fabric-covered tubes and storing horizontally on racks,<ref name=\":0\" /> storing them in archival-safe containers, and airing them out before storing.<ref name=\":2\" /> If utilizing other fabrics in the storage of quilts, it is common practice to boil-wash these fabrics to remove the manufacturer finish and any pollutants, as well as to soften the fabric.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Handling===\nThe handling of textiles can vary depending on age, materials, and level of damage. If a quilt is in need of treatment, however, handling may become necessary. When handling any object, it is important to first plan ahead and make sure that the object is not being handled unnecessarily and that it is supported at all times.<ref name=\":1\" /> Best practices in the handling of textiles such as quilts involves clean cloth gloves, a clean working and display area, and the use of pencils instead of ink pens in the work area.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other physical factors may cause damage while handling a quilt; this includes snagging and pulling, uneven support, and improper movement. To reduce risks of these hazards, best practice include the following; avoiding jewelry and clothing that could snag the item, working on surfaces larger than the quilt itself, and maintaining even support through the process of transportation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Display/Exhibition===\nAs with handling and storage, environmental factors need to be taken into account when displaying quilts and textiles. Though each individual item will need to be examined and treated based on its individual needs, there are some commonalities between them that museums take into account when putting them in exhibitions. According to the International Quilt Study Center & Museum, quilts are displayed for one out of ten years total, though not necessarily consecutively. This \"minimizes the amount of light exposure and reduces the wear and tear from hanging on display.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.quiltstudy.org/collections/care-and-conservation|title=Care and Conservation {{!}} International Quilt Study Center & Museum|website=www.quiltstudy.org|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref> A majority of quilts are put on display using cord suspension systems and often have cotton sleeves attached to reduce stress to the fibers.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Maintenance/Housekeeping===\nBefore any maintenance or housekeeping can take place, conservators first examine the quilt to decide on the best course of action moving forward. Vacuuming, wet cleaning, dry cleaning, steaming, and ironing are possible methods of maintenance of quilts. Vacuuming is often considered one of the least invasive and easiest ways to clean a quilt and allows dirt and dust to be removed in a minimally-invasive way.<ref name=\":0\" /> As wet cleaning is more invasive than vacuuming, best practices recommend it only be used when necessary.

[[Quilt]]s have been produced for centuries, as utilitarian blankets, decorations, family heirlooms, and now treasured museum collections objects. Quilts are three-layered textile pieces with a decorated top, a back, and a filler in the middle. The composite nature of these objects creates an interesting challenge for their conservation, as the separate layers can be made of different textile materials, multiple colors, and therefore, varying degrees of wear, tear, and damage.\n\n== What is a Quilt? ==\nA quilt is a multi-layered textile, traditionally composed of three layers of fiber: a woven cloth top, a layer of [[Padding|batting]] or wadding, and a woven back, combined using the technique of [[quilting]], the process of sewing the three layers together.\n\nThe pattern of stitching can be the key decorative element if a single piece of fabric is used for the top of a quilt (a \"wholecloth quilt\"), but in many cases the top is pieced from a [[patchwork]] of smaller fabric pieces; and the pattern and color of these pieces will be important to the design.<ref>{{Citation|title=Quilt|date=2019-04-23|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quilt&oldid=893802879|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref> Patterns, fabric, and styles differ greatly based on the time period and area that they were produced in. [[The Quilts of Gee's Bend|The quilts produced]] in [[Boykin, Alabama|Gee's Bend]], Alabama are great examples of the history and use of quilts in specific space and time.\n\n[[Quilting]] is the process of sewing two or more layers of [[Textile|fabric]] together to make a thicker padded material, usually to create a [[quilt]] or quilted garment. The process of quilting uses a [[Sewing needle|needle]] and [[Yarn|thread]] to join two or more layers of material to make a quilt. The quilter's hand or [[sewing machine]] passes the needle and thread through all layers and then brings the needle back up. The process is repeated across the entire area where quilting is wanted.<ref>{{Citation|title=Quilting|date=2019-03-10|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quilting&oldid=887104328|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Composition===\n\nQuilting, sewing together layers of fabric to create a cohesive whole, has been around for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. Europe, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States all have examples of quilts that are hundreds of years old.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quilting |title = History of quilting}}</ref> Depending on the time period and area that they were produced in, quilts can be made of varying textiles, have a myriad of different colors, and be pieced together using different methods. Some quilts produced in the [[Civil war|Civil War]] era were created using [[silk |silk ribbons.]] Silk material such as these ribbons often suffer from what is referred to as \"shattering,\" caused by metal salts that were applied to silk fabrics to create desired \"[[The Rustle of Silk|rustles]]\" in women's dresses, and were used as a weighting agent in these dresses.<ref>Benner, J. (2014). \"Conserving Shattered Silk in an Early 20th Century Souvenir Ribbon Quilt.\"  The Denver Art Museum.</ref> The metal components do considerable damage to silk fabric over time. Quilts containing metal salts formed a minority of these objects, however, they provide an example of the types of features to be identified when considering treatment. The Minnesota Historical Society has some guidelines for preserving quilts that include insights such as looking for deterioration issues due to certain [[fabric]] types such as silk as well as specific [[dyes]].<ref name=\":1\">Bede, D. (1997). Preserving Historic Quilts. Minnesota History Interpreter, 3-6. Retrieved from http://www.mnhs.org/sites/default/files/lhs/techtalk/techtalkseptember1997.pdf.</ref>  In the twenty-first century, quilts are frequently displayed as non-utilitarian works of art, but historically quilts were often used as bed covers. The use of quilts as bedcovers persists today.\n\n===Processes/Techniques===\n\nAfter their creation, the use and production style of quilts varied; initially a utilitarian product used mostly for bed coverings, quilts have evolved to become decorative pieces as well.<ref>History of Quilts. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.quilting-in-america.com/History-of-Quilts.html</ref> Due to the changing uses of these items, techniques for creating them have evolved over the last few centuries. Some common historical and current quilting techniques include the following:\n\n* Patchwork & Piecing\n** One of the primary techniques involved in quilt making is patchwork, sewing together geometric pieces of fabric often to form a design or \"block.\" Also called piecing, this technique can be achieved with hand stitching or with a sewing machine.<ref>International Quilt Study Center & Museum (2013). \"Patchwork.\" World Quilts: The American Story. Retrieved April 23, 2019.</ref>\n* Applique\n**[[Appliqu\u00e9]] is a sewing technique where an upper layer of fabric is sewn onto a ground fabric.<ref name=\":4\">{{Citation|title=Quilt|date=2019-04-23|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quilt&oldid=893802879|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n* Reverse Applique\n** Reverse appliqu\u00e9 is a sewing technique where a ground fabric is cut, another piece of fabric is placed under the ground fabric, the raw edges of the ground fabric are tucked under, and the newly folded edge is sewn down to the lower fabric. Stitches are made as inconspicuous as possible.<ref name=\":4\" />\n* Quilting\n** Quilting, typically a running stitch, can be achieved by hand or by sewing machine. Hand quilting has often been a communally productive act with quilters sitting around a large quilting frame.<ref name=\":4\" />\n* Trapunto\n**[[Trapunto quilting|Trapunto]] is a sewing technique where two layers of fabric surrounding a layer of batting are quilted together, and then additional material is added to a portion of the design to increase the profile of relief as compared to the rest of the work.<ref name=\":4\" />\n* Embellishment\n** Additional decorative elements may be added to the surface of a quilt to create a three-dimensional or whimsical effect. The most common objects sewn on are beads or buttons. Decorative trim, [[Piping (sewing)|piping]], [[sequin]]s, found objects, or other items can also be secured to the surface.<ref name=\":4\" />\n* English Paper Piecing\n** English [[Foundation piecing|paper piecing]] is a hand-sewing technique used to maximize accuracy when piecing complex angles together. A paper shape is cut with the exact dimensions of the desired piece. Fabric is then basted to the paper shape. Adjacent units are then placed face to face, and the seam is [[Blanket stitch|whipstitch]]<nowiki/>ed together. When a given piece is completely surrounded by all the adjacent shapes, the basting thread is cut, and the basting and the paper shape are removed.<ref name=\":4\" /><nowiki/>\n* Foundation Piecing\n**[[Foundation piecing]] is a sewing technique that allows maximum stability of the work as the piecing is created, minimizing the distorting effect of working with slender pieces or bias-cut pieces.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Conservation and Restoration Science==\n\nThe conservation and use of all materials in a museum should be balanced to suit the object and the public. Best practices for the conservation/restoration of items start with the identification of the materials the item is constructed of.  This identification allows [[conservation scientist]]s to effectively treat and preserve the items for future generations. Though referred to my many names, (i.e. conservation scientists, cultural heritage scientists, etc.) these museum professionals have very specific skill sets using knowledge in [[Physical Science|physical science]], [[forensics]], the [[humanities]], [[engineering]], [[computer science]], and [[economics]]. Conservation scientists use the skills they developed in these fields to conserve/restore objects from a wide array of [[museum]] areas including; [[statues]], [[Historic site|historical sites]], [[paper]], and [[textiles]]. As a composite textile, quilts require special consideration. The environment that they are stored in is one basic factor to consider. Being a single piece composed of possibly multiple different fabrics; all of the different fabrics' compositions need to be considered for conservation, storage, display, and treatment purposes. The large size of quilts requires special attention as well, specifically during handling, storage, and display. Due to the fragile nature of textiles, trained professionals are often the best choice to decide on the necessity of repairs and to perform them.\n\n==Agents of Deterioration==\n\nFor the most part, all objects are susceptible to forces (agents of deterioration) that cause them to decay over the course of time through chemical, physical, biological deterioration, or some combination of the three. As with most of these objects, [[Collections care|preventive conservation]] is one of the cornerstones to maintaining quilts for future generations. Through understanding the different agents of deterioration and examining the greatest threat to the objects, the museum can develop a plan to mitigate these risks. As a composite textile often containing different colors, quilts are vulnerable to [[light]].  Overexposure to light can change the colors and strength of the fabrics within them.<ref name=\"culturalheritage.org\">The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). (n.d.). Caring for your Treasures. Retrieved from https://www.culturalheritage.org/website-search-results?indexCatalogue=site-search&searchQuery=textile&wordsMode=0</ref> Light is not the only agent that affects textiles such as quilts; composed of [[organic materials]], they contain [[carbon]], are susceptible to [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]] levels, may absorb water, and can even become homes for [[mold]] and sources of food for [[pest (organism)|pest]]s.<ref name=\"NPS 2012\">NPS. 2012. National Park Service: Museum Handbook. Part One. Chapter 4. 4:7 \u2013 4:10, and, 4:16 (D) - 4:20</ref> Quilts, and textiles in general, can be sensitive to [[chemicals]], [[dust]], [[dirt]], [[oils]], [[smoke]], [[stain]]s, [[perfume]], and even excessive washing.<ref name=\":2\">Beginning Quilt Restoration. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.whitebluffscenter.org/index.php?ID=27</ref> Susceptible to all of these agents, quilts can undergo changes that may cause discernible damage. According to the National Parks Service Museum Handbook, 2012, \"chemical changes in textiles caused by interaction with light also weaken the fabric so that physical damage such as rips and tears are more likely to occur.\"<ref name=\"NPS 2012\"/> To create more habitable environments for quilts, conservators can cycle each specimen in and out of lighted areas and storage, monitor RH and temperature levels, seal them in individual cases created for them, and more. Preventive conservation is an extremely important tool in the conservators handbook, giving them agency beyond restoration and ideally giving them more control over the natural process of deterioration that is impossible to halt completely.[[File:International Quilt Study Center & Museum Quilts in Common Exhibition.jpg|thumb|[[International Quilt Study Center & Museum]] Quilts Exhibition]]\n\n===Light===\n\n* Light is necessary to view objects in museums, but can cause quite a bit of damage if quilts are left exposed. Ultraviolet radiation and visible light can each affect textile materials such as quilts. Light can cause [[fading]], darkening, [[yellowing]], [[embrittlement]], [[stiffening]], and more.<ref name=\"NPS 2012\"/> Many museums utilize motion activated lights and rotating displays to mitigate the effects of light on objects.\n\n===Relative humidity and temperature===\n\n* Relative humidity refers to the amount of moisture in the air. Fluctuations in moisture can cause textile materials to expand and contract at different rates and can also promote mold, [[mildew]], [[corrosion]], and bleeding of dyes.<ref name=\"culturalheritage.org\"/>\n* Much as with incorrect relative humidity, the presence of water can cause mold, mildew, bleeding of dyes, and further damage to quilts.\n* High and low temperatures and temperature fluctuations can case damage to the different textiles in quilts. High temperatures can speed up chemical reactions and cause damage to fibers and dyes.<ref name=\"culturalheritage.org\"/>\n\n===Pollutants===\n\n* [[Pollutants]] may be many things including dirt, grease, ash, soot, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, and ozone.<ref name=\":3\" /> Many of these pollutants/contaminants may cause issues with textiles such as quilts, especially in the case of certain composite quilts or those made with silks that have metals included. Common pollutants that may affect textiles such as quilts include; [[Sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]] which react with cotton, linen, and [[viscose]] materials and can cause them to discolor and become weak and brittle.<ref>Museums Galleries Scotland - Reducing air pollution.

If quilts are exposed to fire, they can be charred, destroyed, embrittled, scorched, or even harbor smoke.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* Pests, mainly insects and rodents, can damage quilts through consumption, perforation, cutting, grazing, tunneling, weakening, disfiguring, and more.<ref name=\":3\" /> Throughout history, quilts have been made of many different types of materials.  If they are made of animal based, [[synthetic fibers|synthetic]], or plant based textiles materials, different pests can be attracted to them. Most quilts are made of [[cotton]] or [[linen]], though [[silk]] is also an option. [[Silverfish]], [[carpet beetles]], and [[moths]] are all common pests that can damage quilts.<ref>Museum Textile Service. (n.d.). Category: Pests. Retrieved from http://www.museumtextiles.com/blog/category/pests</ref>\n* Disassociation, often the mishandling or misfiling of objects, can become a problem especially in museums that have multiple quilts and do not keep good records on them. One could be forgotten about, not recorded as moved, or lost entirely.\n\n[[File:Crazy Quilt, 1884.jpg|thumb|This quilt, created in 1884, is being held at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. Composed of velvet and silk, this piece requires careful thought when conserving/restoring it.]]\n\n==Preventive Conservation==\n\nDirect treatment may be necessary for some objects in a museum but, for many others, preventive conservation is often considered the best course of action. Preventive conservation, sometimes called collections care, involves any actions taken to prevent or delay the deterioration of cultural heritage. The primary goal is to identify and reduce potential hazards to heritage with thoughtful control of their surroundings.<ref>Collections care. (2019, February 22). Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collections_care</ref> Preventive conservation utilizes [[environmental monitoring]] and regulation to create the ideal space for objects. The aim is to reduce deterioration; this method can be used for most items in museums including quilts.<ref>The Field Museum. (2018, June 14). Preventive Conservation. Retrieved from https://www.fieldmuseum.org/science/research/area/conserving-collections/preventive-conservation</ref> If preventive conservation options run out, then treatment by a professional can commence. Conservation treatment becomes necessary when there is damage from the absence of preventive care, with improper care, other issues, or even with inherently unstable objects.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Environment===\nThe correct storage of textiles such as quilts is important for their long-term safety. Light, temperature, and humidity are the main factors that impact a textile's deterioration rate. Pests, chemicals, and pollutants may also damage quilts in storage and display environments.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_and_restoration_of_textiles#Environment|title=Conservation and Restoration of Textiles|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Conservators monitor and evaluate museum environments to ensure the longevity of objects stored within. Besides monitoring for pests, chemicals, pollutants, light and humidity levels by themselves, these museum professionals check for any other visible signs and causes of deterioration.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Storage===\nQuilts and other similar textiles can be stored in more than one way. The prerequisites for all storage environments include a clean, dark, cool, and dry space with constant temperature and relative humidity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Flat storage such as shelves and drawers may be used for smaller quilts, but for larger quilts, rolled storage may become necessary. Best practices for storage of quilts include; rolling quilts around acid-free or fabric-covered tubes and storing horizontally on racks,<ref name=\":0\" /> storing them in archival-safe containers, and airing them out before storing.<ref name=\":2\" /> If utilizing other fabrics in the storage of quilts, it is common practice to boil-wash these fabrics to remove the manufacturer finish and any pollutants, as well as to soften the fabric.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Handling===\nThe handling of textiles can vary depending on age, materials, and level of damage. If a quilt is in need of treatment, however, handling may become necessary. When handling any object, it is important to first plan ahead and make sure that the object is not being handled unnecessarily and that it is supported at all times.<ref name=\":1\" /> Best practices in the handling of textiles such as quilts involves clean cloth gloves, a clean working and display area, and the use of pencils instead of ink pens in the work area.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other physical factors may cause damage while handling a quilt; this includes snagging and pulling, uneven support, and improper movement.

''Home: A Short History of an Idea''. According to [[Witold Rybczynski]]\u2019s ''[[Home: A Short History of an Idea]]'', private spaces in households are a Dutch seventeenth-century invention, despite their commonplace nature today. He has argued that home as we now know it came from the Dutch canal house of the seventeenth century. That, he said, was the first time that people identified living quarters as being precisely the residence of a man, a woman and their children. \"The feminization of the home in seventeenth century Holland was one of the most important events in the evolution of the domestic interior.\" This evolution took place in part due to Dutch law being \"explicit on contractual arrangements and on the civil rights of servants\". And, \"for the first time, the person who was in intimate contact with housework was also in a position to influence the arrangement and disposition of the house.\" <br /> Rybczynski (2007) discusses why we live in houses in the first place: \"To understand why we live in [[house]]s, it is necessary to go back several hundred years to Europe. Rural people have always lived in houses, but the typical medieval town dwelling, which combined living space and workplace, was occupied by a mixture of extended families, servants, and employees. This changed in seventeenth-century Holland. [[Dutch Republic|The Netherlands]] was Europe\u2019s first republic, and the world\u2019s first middle-class nation. Prosperity allowed extensive [[home]] ownership, [[republicanism]] discouraged the widespread use of servants, a love of children promoted the [[nuclear family]], and [[Calvinism]] encouraged thrift and other domestic virtues. These circumstances, coupled with a particular affection for the private family home, brought about a [[cultural revolution]]... The idea of urban houses spread to the British Isles thanks to England's strong commercial and cultural links with the Netherlands.\"</ref><ref name=\"Tabor, Philip 2005\">Tabor, Philip (2005). \"Striking Home: The Telematic Assault on Identity\". Published in [[Jonathan Hill (architect)|Jonathan Hill]], editor, ''Occupying Architecture: Between the Architect and the User''. Philip Tabor states the contribution of 17th century Dutch houses as the foundation of houses today: \"As far as the idea of the home is concerned, the home of the home is the Netherlands. This idea's crystallization might be dated to the first three-quarters of the seventeenth century, when the Dutch Netherlands amassed the unprecedented and unrivalled accumulation of capital, and emptied their purses into domestic space.\" <br /> According to [[Jonathan Hill (architect)|Jonathan Hill]] (''Immaterial Architecture'', 2006), compared to the large scaled houses in England and the Renaissance, the [[Dutch Golden Age|17th Century Dutch]] house was smaller, and was only inhabited by up to four to five members. This was due to their embracing \"self-reliance\", in contrast to the dependence on servants, and a design for a lifestyle centered on the [[family]]. It was important for the Dutch to separate work from domesticity, as the [[home]] became an escape and a place of [[comfort]]. This way of living and the home has been noted as highly similar to the [[contemporary]] family and their dwellings. House layouts also incorporated the idea of the corridor as well as the importance of function and privacy. By the end of the 17th Century, the house layout was soon transformed to become employment-free, enforcing these ideas for the future. This came in favour for the industrial revolution, gaining large-scale factory production and workers. The house layout of the Dutch and its functions are still relevant today.</ref> The [[Netherlands]]<ref>including the Dutch-speaking [[Southern Netherlands]] prior to [[Fall of Antwerp|1585]]</ref> and [[History of Dutch nationality|its people]] have made numerous seminal contributions to the world's civilization,<ref>Taylor, Peter J.

Royal absolutism became the main tendency of the time. The kings of Europe raised a novel claim: they declared that they were appointed by God to be the fountainhead of all life and activity in society. Accordingly, they sought to direct religion, culture, politics, and, especially, the economic life of the people. To support their burgeoning bureaucracies and constant wars, the rulers required ever-increasing quantities of taxes, which they tried to squeeze out of their subjects in ways that were contrary to precedent and custom. <br /> The first people to revolt against this system were the Dutch. After a struggle that lasted for decades, they won their independence from Spain and proceeded to set up a unique polity. The United Provinces, as the radically decentralized state was called, had no king and little power at the federal level. Making money was the passion of these busy manufacturers and traders; they had no time for hunting heretics or suppressing new ideas. Thus de facto religious toleration and a wide-ranging freedom of the press came to prevail. Devoted to industry and trade, the Dutch established a legal system based solidly on the rule of law and the sanctity of property and contract. Taxes were low, and everyone worked. The Dutch \"economic miracle\" was the wonder of the age. Thoughtful observers throughout Europe noted the Dutch success with great interest. |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russellshorto.com/book/amsterdam |author=[[Russell Shorto|Shorto, Russell]] |title=Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City (overview) |publisher=russellshorto.com |quote=Liberalism has many meanings, but in its classical sense it is a philosophy based on individual freedom.

''The Britannica Guide to Inventions That Changed the Modern World''</ref> economics and finance,<ref>During their [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]], the Dutch were responsible for three major institutional innovations in [[Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815)|economic]] and [[Financial history of the Dutch Republic|financial history]]. The first major innovation was the foundation of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), the world's first [[publicly traded company]], in 1602. As the first [[listed company]] (the first company to be ever [[Listing (finance)|listed]] on an official [[stock exchange]]), the VOC was the first company to actually issue [[stock]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to the general public. Considered by many experts to be the world's first truly (modern) [[multinational corporation]], the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] was also the first permanently organized [[limited liability company|limited-liability]] [[joint-stock company]], with a permanent [[Financial capital|capital]] base. The Dutch merchants were the pioneers in laying the basis for modern [[corporate governance]]. The VOC is often considered as the precursor of modern [[corporation]]s, if not the first truly modern corporation. It was the VOC that invented the idea of investing in the company rather than in a specific venture governed by the company. With its pioneering features such as [[corporate identity]] (first globally-recognized [[corporate logo]]), entrepreneurial spirit, [[legal personality|legal personhood]], [[transnational corporation|transnational]] ([[multinational corporation|multinational]]) operational structure, high stable profitability, permanent [[Financial capital|capital]] (fixed capital stock), freely transferable [[Share (finance)|shares]] and [[securities trading|tradable securities]], separation of [[ownership]] and [[management]], and [[limited liability]] for both [[shareholder]]s and managers, the VOC is generally considered a major institutional breakthrough and the model for the large-scale business enterprises that now dominate the global economy. <br /> The second major innovation was the creation of the world's first fully functioning [[financial market]], with the birth of a fully fledged [[capital market]]. The Dutch were also the first to effectively use a fully-fledged [[capital market]] (including the [[bond market]] and the [[stock market]]) to finance [[companies]] (such as the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] and the [[Dutch West India Company|WIC]]). It was in seventeenth-century Amsterdam that the global [[securities market]] began to take on its modern form. In 1602 the Dutch East India Company ([[Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie|VOC]]) established an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] in [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|Amsterdam]] where VOC [[stock]] and [[bond (finance)|bonds]] could be traded in a [[secondary market]]. The VOC undertook the world's first recorded [[IPO]] in the same year. The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] (''Amsterdamsche Beurs'' in Dutch) was also the world's first fully-fledged [[stock exchange]]. While the [[Italian city-states]] produced the first transferable government bonds, they didn't develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged [[capital market]]: corporate shareholders. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first [[company]] to offer [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]]. The dividend averaged around 18% of capital over the course of the company's 200-year existence. Dutch investors were the first to trade their [[Share (finance)|shares]] at a regular [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|stock exchange]]. The buying and selling of these [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]] in the VOC became the basis of the first [[stock market]]. It was in the [[Dutch Republic]] that the early techniques of [[market manipulation|stock-market manipulation]] were developed. The Dutch pioneered [[Futures contract|stock futures]], [[stock options]], [[short selling]], [[bear raid]]s, debt-equity swaps, and other [[speculation|speculative instruments]]. Amsterdam businessman [[Joseph de la Vega]]'s ''Confusion of Confusions'' (1688) was the earliest book about [[stock trading]]. <br /> The third major innovation was the establishment of the [[Bank of Amsterdam]] ([[Amsterdamsche Wisselbank]] in Dutch) in 1609, which led to the introduction of the concept of [[bank money]]. The [[Bank of Amsterdam]] was arguably the world's first [[central bank]]. The Wisselbank's innovations helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the [[central banking|central banking system]] that now plays a vital role in the world's economy. It occupied a central position in the financial world of its day, providing an effective, efficient and trusted system for national and international payments, and introduced the first ever [[international reserve currency]], the [[Dutch guilder|bank guilder]]. Lucien Gillard (2004) calls it the ''European guilder'' (''le florin europ\u00e9en''), and [[Adam Smith]] devotes many pages to explaining how the bank guilder works (Smith 1776: 446\u201355). The model of the Wisselbank as a [[state bank]] was adapted throughout Europe, including the [[Bank of Sweden]] (1668) and the [[Bank of England]] (1694).</ref><ref>De Vries, Jan; Woude, Ad van der (1997).

It was first depicted on a [[celestial globe]] as Triangulus Antarcticus by Plancius in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by [[Johann Bayer]] in his 1603 ''Uranometria''.\n* ''[[Tucana]]'' is Latin for the [[toucan]], a South American bird.\n* ''[[Volans]]'' represents a [[flying fish]]; its name is a shortened form of its original name, ''Piscis Volans''.\n\n==== Camelopardalis (constellation) (1612\u20131613) ====\n''Camelopardalis'' was created by Plancius in 1613 to represent the animal [[Rebecca]] rode to marry [[Isaac]] in [[the Bible]]. One year later, [[Jakob Bartsch]] featured it in his atlas. [[Johannes Hevelius]] gave it the official name of \"Camelopardus\" or \"Camelopardalis\" because he saw the [[constellation]]'s many faint stars as the spots of a [[giraffe]].\n\n==== Monoceros (constellation) (1612\u20131613) ====\n''Monoceros'' is a relatively modern creation. Its first certain appearance was on a globe created by Plancius in 1612 or 1613. It was later charted by Bartsch as ''Unicornus'' in his 1624 star chart.\n\n==== Rings of Saturn (1655) ====\n[[Image:Unraveling Saturn's Rings.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first person to describe [[Rings of Saturn|Saturn's rings]] as a disk surrounding [[Saturn]]]]\n\nIn 1655, Huygens became the first person to suggest that Saturn was surrounded by a ring, after Galileo's much less advanced telescope had failed to show rings. Galileo had reported the anomaly as possibly 3 planets instead of one.\n\n==== Titan (Saturn's moon) (1655) ====\n[[Image:Titan in natural color Cassini.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] was the first known [[Moons of Saturn|moon of Saturn]], discovered in 1655 by [[Christiaan Huygens]].]]\n\nIn 1655, using a 50 power [[refracting telescope]] that he designed himself, Huygens discovered the first of [[Saturn]]'s moons, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].\n\n==== Kapteyn's Star (1897) ====\n[[Kapteyn's Star]] is a [[Stellar classification|class M1]] [[red dwarf]] about 12.76 [[light year]]s from Earth in the southern [[constellation]] [[Pictor]], and the closest [[galactic halo|halo]] star to the Solar System. With a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of nearly 9 it is visible through [[binoculars]] or a [[telescope]]. It had the highest [[proper motion]] of any star known until the discovery of [[Barnard's Star]] in 1916. Attention was first drawn to what is now known as [[Kapteyn's Star]] by the Dutch astronomer [[Jacobus Kapteyn]], in 1897.\n\n==== Discovery of evidence for galactic rotation (1904) ====\nIn 1904, studying the [[proper motion]]s of stars, Dutch astronomer [[Jacobus Kapteyn]] reported that these were not random, as it was believed in that time; stars could be divided into two streams, moving in nearly opposite directions. It was later realized that Kapteyn's data had been the first evidence of the rotation of our [[Galaxy]], which ultimately led to the finding of [[Galaxy rotation curve|galactic rotation]] by [[Bertil Lindblad]] and [[Jan Oort]].\n\n==== Galactic halo (1924) ====\nIn 1924, Dutch astronomer [[Jan Oort]] [[:Category:Discoveries by Jan Oort|discovered]] the [[galactic halo]], a group of stars orbiting the [[Milky Way]] but outside the main disk.\n\n==== Oort constants (1927) ====\nThe [[Oort constants]] (discovered by [[Jan Oort]]) <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are empirically derived parameters that characterize the local rotational properties of the [[Milky Way]].\n\n==== Evidence of dark matter (1932) ====\nIn 1932, Dutch astronomer [[Jan Oort]] became the first person to discover evidence of [[dark matter]]. Oort proposed the substance after measuring the motions of nearby stars in the [[Milky Way]] relative to the galactic plane. He found that the mass of the galactic plane must be more than the mass of the material that can be seen. A year later (1933), [[Fritz Zwicky]] examined the dynamics of clusters of galaxies and found their movements similarly perplexing.\n\n==== Discovery of methane in the atmosphere of Titan (1944) ====\nThe first formal proof of the existence of an [[Atmosphere of Titan|atmosphere]] around [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] came in 1944, when [[Gerald Kuiper]] observed Titan with the new McDonald {{convert|82|in|m|adj=on}} telescope and discovered spectral signatures on Titan at wavelengths longer than 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm (micrometers), among which he identified two absorption bands of [[methane]] at 6190 and 7250&nbsp;\u00c5 (Kuiper1944). This discovery was significant not only because it requires a dense [[atmosphere]] with a significant fraction of methane, but also because the atmosphere needs to be chemically evolved, since methane requires [[hydrogen]] in the presence of [[carbon]], and molecular and atomic hydrogen would have escaped from Titan's weak gravitational field since the formation of the [[solar system]].<ref>Brown, Robert Hanbury; Lebreton, Jean-Pierre; Waite, John H. (2009). ''Titan from Cassini-Huygens'', p. 10</ref>\n\n==== Discovery of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Mars (1947) ====\nUsing [[infrared]] spectrometry, in 1947 the Dutch-American astronomer [[Gerard Kuiper]] detected [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]], a discovery of biological significance because it is a principal [[gas]] in the process of [[photosynthesis]] (see also: [[History of Mars observation]]). He was able to estimate that the amount of carbon dioxide over a given area of the surface is double that on the [[Earth]].\n\n==== Miranda (Uranus's moon) (1948) ====\n[[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]] is the smallest and innermost of [[Uranus]]'s five major moons. It was discovered by [[Gerard Kuiper]] on 16 February 1948 at [[McDonald Observatory]].\n\n==== Nereid (Neptune's moon) (1949) ====\n[[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]], also known as Neptune II, is the third-largest [[natural satellite|moon]] of [[Neptune]] and was its second moon to be discovered, on 1 May 1949, by Gerard Kuiper, on photographic plates taken with the 82-inch telescope at McDonald Observatory.\n\n==== Oort cloud (1950) ====\nThe ''[[Oort cloud]]'' or ''\u00d6pik\u2013Oort cloud'', named after Dutch astronomer [[Jan Oort]] and Estonian astronomer [[Ernst \u00d6pik]], is a spherical cloud of predominantly [[volatiles|icy]] [[planetesimal]]s believed to surround the [[Sun]] at a distance of up to {{convert|50,000|AU|ly|abbr=on|lk=on|sigfig=1}}. Further evidence for the existence of the [[Kuiper belt]] emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their [[volatility (physics)|volatile]] surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually evaporating them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently.<ref name=\"matter\">{{cite journal | author=David Jewitt | title=From Kuiper Belt Object to Cometary Nucleus: The Missing Ultrared Matter | journal=[[The Astronomical Journal]] | volume=123 | issue=2 | pages=1039\u201349 | year=2002 | doi=10.1086/338692 | bibcode=2002AJ....123.1039J}}</ref> One such area of replenishment is the [[Oort cloud]], a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer [[:Category:Discoveries by Jan Oort|Jan Oort]] in 1950.<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1950BAN....11...91O |title=The structure of the cloud of comets surrounding the Solar System and a hypothesis concerning its origin |author1=Oort |first1=J.

In 1951, he proposed the existence of what is now called the [[Kuiper Belt]], a disk-shaped region of [[minor planets]] outside the orbit of [[Neptune]], which also is a source of short-period [[comet]]s.\n\n=== Biology ===\n==== Foundations of modern reproductive biology (1660s \u20131670s) ====\n\nIn the 1660s and 1670s the [[Dutch Republic]]-based scientists (in particular [[Leiden University]]-based [[Jan Swammerdam]] and [[Nicolas Steno]], and [[Delft]]-based [[Regnier de Graaf]] and [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]) made key discoveries about [[animal reproduction|animal]] and [[human reproduction]]. Their research and discoveries contributed greatly to the modern understanding of the female [[mammalian]] [[reproductive system]].<ref>Cobb, Matthew (2006). ''Generation: The Seventeenth-Century Scientists Who Unraveled the Secrets of Sex, Life, and Growth''. (New York: Bloomsbury)</ref> Many authors see [[Regnier de Graaf]] as the founder of modern [[reproductive biology]] (Setchell, 1974).<ref>Setchell, B. P. (1974) \"The Contributions of Regnier de Graaf to Reproductive Biology,\" ''European Journal of Gynecology and Reproductive Biology'', Volume 4, Issue 1, p. 1\u201339, 1974</ref> This is due essentially to his use of convergent scientific methods: meticulous dissections, clinical observations and critical analysis of the available literature (Ankumet al., 1996).<ref>Hunter, R. H. F. (2003). ''Physiology of the Graafian Follicle and Ovulation''. (Cambridge University Press)</ref>\n\n==== Function of the Fallopian tubes (1660s) ====\nDutch physician & anatomist [[Regnier de Graaf]] may have been the first to understand the reproductive function of the [[Fallopian tube]]s. He described the [[hydrosalpinx]], linking its development to female [[infertility]]. de Graaf recognized pathologic conditions of the tubes. He was aware of tubal pregnancies, and he surmised that the mammalian egg traveled from the [[ovary]] to the [[uterus]] through the tube.\n\n==== Development of ovarian follicles (1672) ====\nIn his ''De Mulierum Organis Generatione Inservientibus'' (1672), de Graaf provided the first thorough description of the female [[gonad]] and established that it produced the [[ovum]]. De Graaf used the terminology [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]] or egg (ovum) for what now called the [[ovarian follicle]]. Because the fluid-filled ovarian vesicles had been observed previously by others, including [[Andreas Vesalius]] and [[Falloppio]], De Graaf did not claim their discovery. He noted that he was not the first to describe them, but to describe their development. De Graaf was the first to observe changes in the ovary before and after mating and describe the [[corpus luteum]]. From the observation of [[pregnancy]] in rabbits, he concluded that the follicle contained the [[oocyte]]. The mature stage of the ovarian follicle is called the [[Graafian follicle]] in his honour, although others, including [[Fallopius]], had noticed it previously but failed to recognize its reproductive significance.\n\n==== Foundations of microbiology (discovery of microorganisms) (1670s) ====\n[[Image:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723).

[[Robert Hooke]] is cited as the first to record microscopic observation of the fruiting bodies of [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s, in 1665. However, the first observation of [[microbe]]s using a microscope is generally credited to van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1670s, he observed and researched bacteria and other [[microorganism]]s, using a single-lens microscope of his own design.<ref name=\"Windelspecht, Michael 2002 p. 168\">Windelspecht, Michael (2002).

Ultimately, nearly all living things depend on energy produced from photosynthesis. It is also responsible for producing the [[oxygen]] that makes animal life possible. Organisms that produce energy through photosynthesis are called [[photoautotroph]]s. Plants are the most visible representatives of photoautotrophs, but bacteria and algae also employ the process.\n\n==== Plant respiration (1779) ====\nPlant respiration was also discovered by Ingenhousz in 1779.\n\n==== Foundations of virology (1898) ====\n[[Martinus Beijerinck]] is considered one of the founders of [[History of virology|virology]]. In 1898, he published results on his filtration experiments, demonstrating that [[tobacco mosaic disease]] is caused by an infectious agent smaller than a bacterium. His results were in accordance with similar observations made by [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] in 1892. Like Ivanovsky and [[Adolf Mayer]], predecessor at [[Wageningen]], Beijerinck could not culture the filterable infectious agent. He concluded that the agent can replicate and multiply in living plants. He named the new [[pathogen]] ''[[virus]]'' to indicate its non-bacterial nature. This discovery is considered to be the beginning of [[virology]].\n\n==== Chemistry of photosynthesis (1931) ====\nIn 1931, [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]] made key discoveries explaining the [[chemistry]] of [[photosynthesis]]. By studying [[purple sulfur bacteria]] and [[green sulfur bacteria]], he was the first scientist to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a [[Light-dependent reaction|light-dependent]] [[redox]] reaction, in which [[hydrogen]] reduces [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>Stenesh, J. (1998). ''Biochemistry'', p. 377</ref><ref>Khanna, Pragya (2008). ''Cell and Molecular Biology'', p. 151</ref> Expressed as:\n:2 H<sub>2</sub>A + CO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2A + CH<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nwhere A is the [[electron acceptor]]. His discovery predicted that H<sub>2</sub>O is the hydrogen donor in green plant photosynthesis and is oxidized to O<sub>2</sub>. The chemical summation of photosynthesis was a milestone in the understanding of the chemistry of photosynthesis. This was later experimentally verified by [[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robert Hill]].\n\n==== Foundations of modern ethology (Tinbergen's four questions) (1930s) ====\nMany [[naturalists]] have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history. [[Ethology]] has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, and Wallace Craig. The modern discipline of [[ethology]] is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and by Austrian biologists [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]].<ref>Burkhardt, Jr., Richard W. (2005). ''Patterns of Behavior: Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and the Founding of Ethology''. (University of Chicago Press)</ref>\n\n[[Tinbergen's four questions]], named after [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], one of the founders of modern [[ethology]], are complementary categories of explanations for behaviour. It suggests that an integrative understanding of behaviour must include both a proximate and ultimate (functional) analysis of behaviour, as well as an understanding of both phylogenetic/developmental history and the operation of current mechanisms.<ref>Daly, M & Wilson, M. (1983). Sex, evolution, and behaviour. Brooks-Cole.</ref>\n\n==== Vroman effect (1975) ====\nThe [[Vroman effect]], named after [[Leo Vroman]], is exhibited by [[protein]] [[adsorption]] to a surface by [[blood plasma|blood serum]] proteins.\n\n=== Chemistry ===\n==== Concept of gas (1600s) ====\n\nFlemish physician [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] is sometimes considered the founder of [[pneumatic chemistry]], coining the word ''[[gas]]'' and conducting experiments involving gases. Van Helmont had derived the word \u201cgas\u201d from the Dutch word ''geest'', which means ghost or spirit.\n\n==== Foundations of stereochemistry (1874) ====\nDutch chemist [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] is generally considered to be one of the founders of the field of [[stereochemistry]]. In 1874, [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|Van 't Hoff]] built on the work on isomers of German chemist [[Johannes Wislicenus]], and showed that the four valencies of the [[carbon atom]] were probably directed in space toward the four corners of a regular tetrahedron, a model which explained how optical activity could be associated with an asymmetric carbon atom. He shares credit for this with the French chemist [[Joseph Le Bel]], who independently came up with the same idea. Three months before his doctoral degree was awarded Van 't Hoff published this theory, which today is regarded as the foundation of [[stereochemistry]], first in a Dutch pamphlet in the fall of 1874, and then in the following May in a small French book entitled ''La chimie dans l'espace''. A German translation appeared in 1877, at a time when the only job Van 't Hoff could find was at the Veterinary School in [[Utrecht]]. In these early years his theory was largely ignored by the scientific community, and was sharply criticized by one prominent chemist, [[Hermann Kolbe]]. However, by about 1880 support for Van 't Hoff's theory by such important chemists as [[Johannes Wislicenus]] and [[Viktor Meyer]] brought recognition.\n\n==== Foundations of modern physical chemistry (1880s) ====\n[[Jacobus van 't Hoff]] is also considered as one of the modern founders of the disciple of [[physical chemistry]].<ref>[[Keith J. Laidler|Laidler, Keith J.]]. ''Chemical Kinetics and the Origins of Physical Chemistry''. (''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'', March 1985, Volume 32, Issue 1, p. 43\u201375)</ref> The first scientific journal specifically in the field of physical chemistry was the German journal, ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie'', founded in 1887 by [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] and Van 't Hoff. Together with [[Svante Arrhenius]], these were the leading figures in physical chemistry in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\n==== Van 't Hoff equation (1884) ====\nThe [[Van 't Hoff equation]] in [[chemical thermodynamics]] relates the change in the [[equilibrium constant]], ''K<sub>eq</sub>'', of a chemical equilibrium to the change in [[temperature]], ''T'', given the [[Enthalpy of formation|standard enthalpy change]], ''\u0394H<sup><s>o</s></sup>'', for the process. It was proposed by Dutch chemist [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] in 1884.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/hoff-bio.html Biography on Nobel prize website]. Nobelprize.org (1911-03-01). Retrieved on 2013-11-8.</ref> The ''Van 't Hoff equation'' has been widely utilized to explore the changes in [[state functions]] in a [[thermodynamic system]]. The ''Van 't Hoff plot'', which is derived from this equation, is especially effective in estimating the change in [[enthalpy]], or total energy, and [[entropy]], or amount of disorder, of a [[chemical reaction]].\n\n==== Van 't Hoff factor (1884) ====\nThe '''van 't Hoff factor <math> i </math>''' is a measure of the effect of a solute upon [[colligative properties]] such as [[osmotic pressure]], relative lowering in [[vapor pressure]], [[Boiling-point elevation|elevation of boiling point]] and [[freezing point depression]]. The [[van 't Hoff factor]] is the ratio between the actual concentration of particles produced when the substance is dissolved, and the [[concentration]] of a substance as calculated from its mass.\n\n==== Lobry de Bruyn\u2013van Ekenstein transformation (1885) ====\nIn [[carbohydrate chemistry]], the [[Lobry de Bruyn\u2013van Ekenstein transformation]] is the base or acid-catalyzed transformation of an [[aldose]] into the [[ketose isomer]] or vice versa, with a tautomeric [[enediol]] as reaction intermediate. The transformation is relevant for the industrial production of certain [[ketose]]s and was discovered in 1885 by [[Cornelis Adriaan Lobry van Troostenburg de Bruyn]] and [[Willem Alberda van Ekenstein]].\n\n==== Prins reaction (1919) ====\nThe Prins reaction is an [[organic reaction]] consisting of an [[electrophilic addition]] of an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] to an [[alkene]] or [[alkyne]] followed by capture of a [[nucleophile]]. Dutch chemist Hendrik Jacobus Prins discovered two new [[organic reaction]]s, both now carrying the name [[Prins reaction]]. The first was the addition of [[polyhalogen]] compounds to [[olefin]]s, was found during Prins doctoral research, while the others, the acid-catalyzed addition of aldehydes to olefinic compounds, became of industrial relevance.\n\n==== Hafnium (1923) ====\nDutch physicist [[Dirk Coster]] and Hungarian-Swedish chemist [[George de Hevesy]] co-discovered ''[[Hafnium]]'' (Hf) in 1923, by means of [[X-ray]] spectroscopic analysis of [[zirconium]] ore. ''Hafnium' is named after ''Hafnia', the Latin name for [[Copenhagen]] (Denmark), where it was discovered.\n\n==== Crystal bar process (1925) ====\nThe [[crystal bar process]] (also known as ''iodide process'' or the ''van Arkel\u2013de Boer process'') was developed by Dutch chemists [[Anton Eduard van Arkel]] and [[Jan Hendrik de Boer]] in 1925. It was the first industrial process for the commercial production of pure ductile metallic [[zirconium]]. It is used in the production of small quantities of ultra-pure [[titanium]] and zirconium.\n\n==== Koopmans' theorem (1934) ====\n[[Koopmans' theorem]] states that in closed-shell [[Hartree\u2013Fock theory]], the first [[ionization energy]] of a molecular system is equal to the negative of the orbital energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital ([[HOMO]]).

He specifically postulated that inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in ''particles''. He called these units ''pangenes'', a term shortened in 1909 to [[gene]]s by Danish botanist [[Wilhelm Johannsen]].\n\n==== Rediscovery the laws of inheritance (1900) ====\n1900 marked the \"rediscovery of [[Mendelian genetics]]\". The significance of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work was not understood until early in the twentieth century, after his death, when his research was re-discovered by [[Hugo de Vries]], [[Carl Correns]] and [[Erich von Tschermak]], who were working on similar problems.<ref>Kuiper, Kathleen (2010). ''The Britannica Guide to Theories and Ideas That Changed the Modern World'', p. 56</ref> They were unaware of Mendel's work. They worked independently on different plant hybrids, and came to Mendel's conclusions about the rules of [[inheritance]].\n\n=== Geology ===\n==== Bushveld Igneous Complex (1897) ====\n\nThe [[Bushveld Igneous Complex]] (or BIC) is a large, layered igneous intrusion within the Earth's crust that has been tilted and eroded and now outcrops around what appears to be the edge of a great geological basin, the [[Transvaal Basin]]. Located in South Africa, the BIC contains some of Earth's richest [[ore deposit]]s. The complex contains the world's largest reserves of [[platinum group metals]] (PGMs), [[platinum]], [[palladium]], [[osmium]], [[iridium]], [[rhodium]], and [[ruthenium]], along with vast quantities of iron, [[tin]], [[chromium]], [[titanium]] and [[vanadium]]. The site was discovered around 1897 by Dutch geologist [[Gustaaf Molengraaff]].\n\n=== Mathematics ===\n==== Analytic geometry (1637) ====\n\nDescartes (1596\u20131650) was born in France, but spent most of his adult life in the Dutch Republic. As [[Bertrand Russell]] noted in his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945): \"He lived in [[Holland]] for twenty years (1629\u201349), except for a few brief visits to France and one to England, all on business....\". In 1637, Descartes published his work on the methods of science, ''[[Discourse on the Method|Discours de la m\u00e9thode]]'' in Leiden. One of its three appendices was ''[[La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]]'', in which he outlined a method to connect the expressions of [[algebra]] with the [[diagram]]s of [[geometry]]. It combined both algebra and geometry under one specialty  \u2013  [[algebraic geometry]], now called [[analytic geometry]], which involves reducing geometry to a form of [[arithmetic]] and algebra and translating geometric shapes into [[algebraic equation]]s.\n\n==== Cartesian coordinate system (1637) ====\nDescartes' ''La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie'' contains Descartes' first introduction of the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\n==== Differential geometry of curves (concepts of the involute and evolute of a curve) (1673) ====\n[[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to publish in 1673 (''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'') a specific method of determining the [[evolute]] and [[involute]] of a [[curve]]<ref>Ungs, Michael (2010). ''The Theory of Quantum Torus Knots: Its Foundation in Differential Geometry'', Volume II, p. 334</ref>\n\n==== Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation (1895) ====\nIn [[mathematics]], the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]] ('''KdV equation''' for short) is a [[mathematical model]] of waves on shallow water surfaces. It is particularly notable as the prototypical example of an [[exactly solvable model]], that is, a non-linear [[partial differential equation]] whose solutions can be exactly and precisely specified. The equation is named for [[Diederik Korteweg]] and [[Gustav de Vries]] who, in 1895, proposed a mathematical model which allowed to predict the waves behaviour on shallow water surfaces.<ref>De Gloria, Alessandro (2014).

E. J. Brouwer|Luitzen Brouwer]], who proved it in 1911.\n\n==== Proof of the hairy ball theorem (1912) ====\nThe [[hairy ball theorem]] of [[algebraic topology]] states that there is no nonvanishing [[continuous function|continuous]] tangent [[vector field]] on even-dimensional [[n\u2011sphere|''n''-spheres]]. The theorem was first stated by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] in the late 19th century.

By his study of the oscillation period of compound pendulums Huygens made pivotal contributions to the development of the concept of [[moment of inertia]].\n\n==== Tautochrone curve (isochrone curve) (1659) ====\nA [[tautochrone]] or [[isochrone curve]] is the curve for which the time taken by an object sliding without friction in uniform gravity to its lowest point is independent of its starting point. The curve is a [[cycloid]], and the time is equal to \u03c0 times the square root of the radius over the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]]. [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to discover the [[tautochrone|tautochronous property]] (or [[isochrone curve|isochronous property]]) of the cycloid.<ref>Knoebel, Arthur; Laubenbacher, Reinhard; Lodder, Jerry; Pengelley, David (2007). ''Mathematical Masterpieces: Further Chronicles by the Explorers''. (Springer), p. 169. \"The cycloid had already occupied the minds of great mathematicians and scientists such as Galileo, Torricelli, Mersenne, Roberval, Fermat, Descartes, Pascal, and others [18], yet none of them discovered its isochronous property.\"</ref> The [[tautochrone]] problem, the attempt to identify this curve, was solved by Christiaan Huygens in 1659. He proved geometrically in his ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'', originally published in 1673, that the curve was a [[cycloid]]. Huygens also proved that the time of descent is equal to the time a body takes to fall vertically the same distance as the diameter of the circle which generates the cycloid, multiplied by \u03c0\u20442. The [[tautochrone curve]] is the same as the [[brachistochrone curve]] for any given starting point. [[Johann Bernoulli]] posed the problem of the [[brachistochrone]] to the readers of ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'' in June, 1696. He published his solution in the journal in May of the following year, and noted that the solution is the same curve as Huygens's [[tautochrone curve]].<ref>Struik, Dirk Jan (1986).

As Bernoulli noted: \"We have a just admiration for Huygens, because he was the first to discover that a heavy point on an ordinary cycloid falls in the same time, whatever the position from which the motion begins.\"</ref>\n\n==== Coupled oscillation (spontaneous synchronization) (1665) ====\n[[Christiaan Huygens]] observed that two pendulum clocks mounted next to each other on the same support often become synchronized, swinging in opposite directions. In 1665, he reported the results by letter to the [[Royal Society of London]]. It is referred to as \"an odd kind of sympathy\" in the Society's minutes. This may be the first published observation of what is now called ''coupled oscillations''. In the 20th century, ''coupled oscillators'' took on great practical importance because of two discoveries: [[laser]]s, in which different atoms give off light waves that oscillate in unison, and [[superconductor]]s, in which pairs of electrons oscillate in synchrony, allowing electricity to flow with almost no resistance. ''Coupled oscillators'' are even more ubiquitous in nature, showing up, for example, in the synchronized flashing of fireflies and chirping of crickets, and in the pacemaker cells that regulate [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeats]].\n\n=== Medicine ===\n==== Foundations of modern (human) anatomy (1543) ====\n\n[[Image:Vesalius 164frc.png|right|thumb|200px|One of the large, detailed illustrations in [[Andreas Vesalius]]'s ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', 1543]]\n\nFlemish anatomist and physician [[Andreas Vesalius]] is often referred to as the founder of modern [[human anatomy]] for the publication of the seven-volume ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''On the Structure of the Human Body'') in 1543.\n\n==== Crystals in gouty tophi (1679) ====\nIn 1679, van Leeuwenhoek used a microscopes to assess tophaceous material and found that [[Tophus|gouty tophi]] consist of aggregates of needle-shaped crystals, and not globules of chalk as was previously believed.\n\n==== Boerhaave syndrome (1724) ====\n[[Boerhaave syndrome]] (also known as ''spontaneous esophageal perforation'' or ''esophageal rupture'') refers to an [[esophagus|esophageal]] rupture secondary to forceful [[vomiting]].

The syndrome was described after the case of a Dutch admiral, Baron Jan von Wassenaer, who died of the condition.\n\n==== Factor V Leiden (1994) ====\n[[Factor V Leiden]] is an inherited disorder of blood clotting. It is a variant of human [[factor V]] that causes a hypercoagulability disorder. It is named after the city Leiden, where it was first identified by R. Bertina, et al., in 1994.\n\n=== Microbiology ===\n==== Blood cells (1658) ====\n\nIn 1658 Dutch naturalist [[Jan Swammerdam]] was the first person to observe [[red blood cells]] under a microscope and in 1695, [[microscopist]] [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]], also Dutch, was the first to draw an illustration of \"red corpuscles\", as they were called. No further [[blood cells]] were discovered until 1842 when the [[platelets]] were discovered.\n\n==== Red blood cells (1658) ====\nThe first person to observe and describe [[red blood cell]]s was Dutch biologist [[Jan Swammerdam]], who had used an early microscope to study the [[blood]] of a frog.\n\n==== Micro-organisms (1670s) ====\n[[File:Leeuwenhoek Microscope.png|thumb|left|upright|Replica of microscope by [[Leeuwenhoek]].

He isolated and described ''[[Spirillum|Spirillum desulfuricans]]'' (now called ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/desulfovibrio |title=Genus ''Desulfovibrio'' |last1=Jean |first1=Euzeby |website= |publisher=[[List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]] |accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>), the first known [[sulfate-reducing bacterium]].\n\n==== Concept of virus (1898) ====\n[[File:Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms tobacco.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) symptoms on [[tobacco]].

Beijerinck discovered what is now known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing and he called it a [[contagium vivum fluidum]] (''contagious living fluid'').

They are aerobic, free-living soil [[Microorganism|microbes]] which play an important role in the [[nitrogen cycle]] in nature, binding atmospheric [[nitrogen]], which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of [[ammonium]] ions into the soil. Apart from being a [[model organism]], it is used by humans for the production of [[biofertilizer]]s, [[food additive]]s, and some [[biopolymer]]s. The first representative of the genus, ''Azotobacter chroococcum'', was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch [[microbiologist]] and botanist [[Martinus Beijerinck]].\n\n==== Enrichment culture (1904) ====\nBeijerinck is credited with developing the first [[enrichment culture]], a fundamental method of studying microbes from the environment.\n\n=== Physics ===\n==== 31 equal temperament (1661) ====\n\nDivision of the [[octave]] into 31 steps arose naturally out of Renaissance [[music theory]]; the lesser [[diesis]]  \u2013  the ratio of an octave to three major thirds, 128:125 or 41.06 cents  \u2013  was approximately a [[interval (music)|fifth]] of a tone and a third of a [[semitone]]. In 1666, [[Lemme Rossi]] first proposed an equal temperament of this order. Shortly thereafter, having discovered it independently, scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] wrote about it also. Since the standard system of [[musical tuning|tuning]] at that time was [[quarter-comma meantone]], in which the fifth is tuned to 5<sup>1/4</sup>, the appeal of this method was immediate, as the fifth of 31-et, at 696.77 cents, is only 0.19 cent wider than the fifth of quarter-comma meantone. Huygens not only realized this, he went farther and noted that 31-ET provides an excellent approximation of septimal, or [[limit (music)|7-limit]] harmony. In the twentieth century, physicist, music theorist and composer [[Adriaan Fokker]], after reading Huygens's work, led a revival of interest in this system of tuning which led to a number of compositions, particularly by Dutch composers. Fokker designed the [[Fokker organ]], a 31-tone equal-tempered organ, which was installed in [[Teylers Museum|Teyler's Museum]] in [[Haarlem]] in 1951.\n\n==== Foundations of classical mechanics (1673) ====\nThrough his fundamental contributions [[Christiaan Huygens]] helped shape and lay the foundations of [[classical mechanics]]. His works cover all the fields of [[mechanics]], from the invention of technical devices applicable to different machines to a purely rational knowledge of motion.<ref>Chareix, Fabien (2004). ''Huygens and Mechanics'' (ESA Science & Technology, University of Paris IV).</ref> Huygens published his results in a classic of the 17th-century mechanics, ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'' (1673), that is regarded as one of the three most important work done in mechanics in the 17th century, the other two being [[Galileo Galilei]]\u2019s ''Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences'' (1638) and [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica'' (1687). It is Huygens' major work on [[pendulum]]s and [[horology]]. As Domenico Bertoloni Meli (2006) notes, ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'' was \u201ca masterful combination of sophisticated mathematics and mechanics mixed with a range of practical applications culminating with a new clock aimed at resolving the vexing problem of longitude.\u201d<ref>Meli, Domenico Bertoloni (2006).

His argument that light consists of [[wave]]s now known as the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]], two centuries later became instrumental in the understanding of [[wave\u2013particle duality]].

His argument that [[light]] consists of [[wave]]s, expounded in his ''Trait\u00e9 de la Lumi\u00e9re'' (''[[Treatise on light]]''), now known as the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]], which two centuries later became instrumental in the understanding of [[wave\u2013particle duality]].]]\nIn his ''[[Treatise on light]]'', Huygens showed how [[Snell's law]] of sines could be explained by, or derived from, the [[wave]] nature of [[light]], using the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]].\n\n==== Bernoulli's principle (1738) ====\n[[Bernoulli's principle]] was discovered by Dutch-Swiss mathematician and physicist [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and named after him. It states that for an [[inviscid flow]], an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.\n\n==== Brownian motion (1785) ====\nIn 1785, Ingenhousz described the irregular movement of [[coal dust]] on the surface of alcohol and therefore has a claim as discoverer of what came to be known as [[Brownian motion]].\n\n==== Buys Ballot's law (1857) ====\nThe law takes its name from Dutch meteorologist [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot]], who published it in the ''Comptes Rendus'', in November 1857. While [[William Ferrel]] first theorized this in 1856, Buys Ballot was the first to provide an [[empirical validation]]. The law states that in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], if a person stands with his back to the wind, the low pressure area will be on his left, because wind travels counterclockwise around low pressure zones in that [[Hemisphere of the Earth|hemisphere]]. this is approximately true in the higher latitudes and is reversed in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].\n\n==== Foundations of molecular physics (1873) ====\nSpearheaded by [[Ernst Mach|Mach]] and [[Wilhelm Ostwald|Ostwald]], a strong philosophical current that denied the existence of [[molecules]] arose towards the end of the 19th century. The molecular existence was considered unproven and the molecular hypothesis unnecessary. At the time Van der Waals' thesis was written (1873), the [[molecular structure]] of [[fluids]] had not been accepted by most physicists, and [[liquid]] and [[vapor]] were often considered as chemically distinct. But [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals|Van der Waals]]'s work affirmed the reality of molecules and allowed an assessment of their size and [[Van der Waals forces|attractive strength]].<ref>Johannes van der Waals: \"...It will be perfectly clear that in all my studies I was quite convinced of the real existence of [[molecules]], that I never regarded them as a figment of my imagination, nor even as mere [[centres of force]] effects. I considered them to be the actual bodies, thus what we term \"body\" in daily speech ought better to be called \"pseudo body\". It is an aggregate of bodies and empty space. We do not know the nature of a molecule consisting of a single chemical atom. It would be premature to seek to answer this question but to admit this ignorance in no way impairs the belief in its real existence. When I began my studies I had the feeling that I was almost alone in holding that view. And when, as occurred already in my 1873 treatise, I determined their number in one gram-mol, their size and the nature of their action, I was strengthened in my opinion, yet still there often arose within me the question whether in the final analysis a molecule is a figment of the imagination and the entire molecular theory too. And now I do not think it any exaggeration to state that the real existence of molecules is universally assumed by physicists. Many of those who opposed it most have ultimately been won over, and my theory may have been a contributory factor. And precisely this, I feel, is a step forward. Anyone acquainted with the writings of Boltzmann and Willard Gibbs will admit that physicists carrying great authority believe that the complex phenomena of the heat theory can only be interpreted in this way. It is a great pleasure for me that an increasing number of younger physicists find the inspiration for their work in studies and contemplations of the molecular theory...\" (''The equation of state for gases and liquids'', Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1910)</ref> By comparing [[Van der Waals equation of state|his equation of state]] with experimental data, Van der Waals was able to obtain estimates for the actual size of molecules and the strength of [[Van der Waals forces|their mutual attraction]].<ref>Sengers, Johanna Levelt (2002), p. 16</ref> The effect of Van der Waals's work on [[molecular science]] in the 20th century was direct and fundamental, as is well recognized and documented, due in large part to books by [[John Rowlinson]] (1988), and by Kipnis and Yavelov (1996). By [[Van der Waals constants (data page)|introducing parameters]] characterizing molecular size and attraction in constructing his [[equation of state]], Van der Waals set the tone for [[molecular physics]] ([[molecular dynamics]] in particular) of the 20th century. That molecular aspects such as size, shape, attraction, and [[intermolecular force|multipolar interactions]] should form the basis for mathematical formulations of the thermodynamic and transport properties of [[fluids]] is presently considered an axiom.<ref>Sengers, Johanna Levelt (2002), p. 255\u201356</ref>\n\n==== Van der Waals equation of state (1873) ====\nIn 1873, [[J. D. van der Waals]] introduced the [[Van der Waals equation of state|first equation of state]] derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent [[molecules]].<ref>Van der Waals, J. D. (1873). ''On the Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States'' (Doctoral dissertation, Universiteit Leiden).</ref> The [[Van der Waals equation]] is generally regarded as the first somewhat realistic [[equation of state]] (beyond the ideal gas law). Van der Waals noted the [[ideal gas|non-ideality]] of [[gases]] and attributed it to the existence of [[intermolecular interaction|molecular]] or atomic interactions. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the [[Redlich-Kwong equation of state]] (1949) and the Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong. While the Van der Waals equation is definitely superior to the [[ideal gas law]] and does predict the formation of a [[liquid phase]], the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. Except at higher pressures, the [[real gas]]es do not obey [[Van der Waals equation]] in all ranges of pressures and temperatures. Despite its limitations, the equation has historical importance, because it was the first attempt to model the behaviour of [[real gas]]es.\n\n==== Van der Waals forces (1873) ====\n[[File:Gecko Leaftail 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Van der Waals force]] between [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s and surfaces is a part of everyday life in many different ways. [[Gecko]]s can stick to walls and ceilings because of [[Van der Waals force]]s.]]\n\nThe [[van der Waals force]]s are named after the scientist who first described them in 1873. [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]] noted the non-ideality of gases and attributed it to the existence of molecular or atomic interactions. They are forces that develop between the atoms inside molecules and keep them together.<ref>Parsegian, V. Adrian (2005). ''Van der Waals Forces: A Handbook for Biologists, Chemists, Engineers, and Physicists'', p. 2</ref> The Van der Waals forces between molecules, much weaker than [[chemical bonds]] but present universally, play a fundamental role in fields as diverse as [[supramolecular chemistry]], [[structural biology]], [[polymer science]], [[nanotechnology]], [[surface science]], and [[condensed matter physics]]. Elucidation of the nature of the Van der Waals forces between molecules has remained a scientific effort from Van der Waals's days to the present.\n\n==== Van der Waals radius (1873) ====\nThe [[Van der Waals radius]], ''r''{{sub|w}}, of an [[atom]] is the radius of an imaginary hard [[sphere]] which can be used to model the atom for many purposes. It is named after [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]], winner of the 1910 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], as he was the first to recognise that atoms were not simply [[Point (geometry)|points]] and to demonstrate the physical consequences of their size through the [[Van der Waals equation|van der Waals equation of state]].\n\n==== Law of corresponding states (1880) ====\nThe [[Theorem of corresponding states|law of corresponding states]] was first suggested and formulated by van der Waals in 1880. This showed that the van der Waals equation of state can be expressed as a simple function of the critical pressure, critical volume and critical temperature. This general form is applicable to all substances. The compound-specific constants a and b in the original equation are replaced by universal (compound-independent) quantities. It was this law that served as a guide during experiments which ultimately led to the [[liquefaction]] of [[hydrogen]] by [[James Dewar]] in 1898 and of [[helium]] by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] in 1908.\n\n==== Lorentz ether theory (1892) ====\n[[Lorentz ether theory]] has its roots in [[Hendrik Lorentz]]'s \"theory of electrons\", which was the final point in the development of the classical [[aether (classical element)|aether]] theories at the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century. Lorentz's initial theory created in 1892 and 1895 was based on a completely motionless aether. Many aspects of Lorentz's theory were incorporated into [[special relativity]] with the works of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]].\n\n==== Lorentz force law (1892) ====\n[[File:Lorentz force particle.svg|180px|thumb|[[Lorentz force]] '''F''' on a [[charged particle]] (of [[electric charge|charge]] ''q'') in motion (instantaneous velocity '''v''').

It is also called the ''radiation reaction force'' or the ''self force''.\n\n==== Lorentz transformation (1895) ====\nIn physics, the [[Lorentz transformation]] (or [[Lorentz transformations]]) is named after the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]]. It was the result of attempts by Lorentz and others to explain how the speed of [[light]] was observed to be independent of the [[frame of reference|reference frame]], and to understand the symmetries of the laws of [[electromagnetism]]. The Lorentz transformation is in accordance with [[special relativity]], but was derived before special relativity. Early approximations of the transformation were published by Lorentz in 1895. In 1905, [[Poincar\u00e9]] was the first to recognize that the transformation has the properties of a [[group (mathematics)|mathematical group]], and named it after Lorentz.\n\n==== Lorentz contraction (1895) ====\nIn physics, [[length contraction]] (more formally called [[Lorentz contraction]] or [[Lorentz\u2013FitzGerald contraction]] after [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[George FitzGerald]]) is the phenomenon of a decrease in length measured by the observer, of an object which is traveling at any non-zero velocity relative to the observer. This contraction is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the [[speed of light]].\n\n==== Lorentz factor (1895) ====\nThe [[Lorentz factor]] or ''Lorentz term'' is the factor by which time, length, and [[relativistic mass]] change for an object while that object is moving. It is an expression which appears in several equations in [[special relativity]], and it arises from deriving the [[Lorentz transformation]]s. The name originates from its earlier appearance in [[Lorentz ether theory|Lorentzian electrodynamics]] \u2013 named after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]].<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/html/oneuniverse/motion_knowledge_concept_12.html One universe], by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], Charles Tsun-Chu Liu, and Robert Irion.</ref>\n\n==== Zeeman effect (1896) ====\n[[File:EinsteinZeemanEhrenfest.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Discoverer of the [[Zeeman effect]], [[Pieter Zeeman]] with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Paul Ehrenfest]] in his laboratory in Amsterdam (circa 1920).]]\nThe [[Zeeman effect]], named after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicist [[Pieter Zeeman]], is the effect of splitting a [[spectral line]] into several components in the presence of a static [[magnetic field]]. It is analogous to the [[Stark effect]], the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an [[electric field]]. Also similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different components have, in general, different intensities, with some being entirely forbidden (in the [[dipole]] approximation), as governed by the [[selection rule]]s.\n\nSince the distance between the Zeeman sub-levels is a function of the magnetic field, this effect can be used to measure the magnetic field, e.g. that of the [[Sun]] and other [[star]]s or in laboratory [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].\nThe Zeeman effect is very important in applications such as [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy, [[electron spin resonance]] spectroscopy, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]]. It may also be utilized to improve accuracy in [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]].\n\nA theory about the [[magnetic sense]] of birds assumes that a protein in the retina is changed due to the Zeeman effect.<ref>[http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/9/583.full The magnetic compass mechanisms of birds and rodents are based on different physical principles].

The Debye model correctly predicts the low temperature dependence of the heat capacity.\n\n==== De Sitter precession (1916) ====\nThe [[geodetic effect]] (also known as geodetic precession, [[de Sitter precession]] or [[De Sitter precession|de Sitter effect]]) represents the effect of the curvature of [[spacetime]], predicted by [[general relativity]], on a vector carried along with an orbiting body. The geodetic effect was first predicted by [[Willem de Sitter]] in 1916, who provided relativistic corrections to the Earth\u2013Moon system's motion.\n\n==== De Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space (1920s) ====\nIn mathematics and physics, a [[de Sitter space]] is the analog in [[Minkowski space]], or spacetime, of a sphere in ordinary, [[Euclidean space]]. The ''n''-dimensional de Sitter space, denoted dS<sub>''n''</sub>, is the [[Lorentzian manifold]] analog of an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] (with its canonical [[Riemannian metric]]); it is maximally [[symmetric]], has constant positive [[scalar curvature|curvature]], and is [[simply connected]] for ''n'' at least 3. The de Sitter space, as well as the [[anti-de Sitter space]] is named after [[Willem de Sitter]] (1872\u20131934), professor of astronomy at [[Leiden University]] and director of the [[Leiden Observatory]]. Willem de Sitter and [[Albert Einstein]] worked in the 1920s in [[Leiden]] closely together on the spacetime structure of our universe. De Sitter space was discovered by [[Willem de Sitter]], and, at the same time, independently by [[Tullio Levi-Civita]].\n\n==== Van der Pol oscillator (1920) ====\nIn [[dynamical system]]s, a [[Van der Pol oscillator]] is a non-conservative [[oscillator]] with non-linear [[damping]]. It was originally proposed by Dutch physicist [[Balthasar van der Pol]] while he was working at Philips in 1920. Van der Pol studied a [[differential equation]] that describes the circuit of a [[vacuum tube]]. It has been used to model other phenomenon such as human [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeats]] by colleague Jan van der Mark.\n\n==== Kramers' opacity law (1923) ====\n[[Kramers' opacity law]] describes the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of a medium in terms of the ambient [[density]] and [[temperature]], assuming that the opacity is dominated by [[ionization|bound-free absorption]] (the absorption of light during ionization of a bound [[electron]]) or [[free-free absorption]] (the absorption of light when scattering a free ion, also called [[bremsstrahlung]]).<ref>Phillips (1999), p. 92.</ref> It is often used to model [[radiative transfer]], particularly in [[stellar atmosphere]]s.<ref>Carroll (1996), p. 274\u2013276.</ref> The relation is named after the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[physicist]] [[Hendrik Kramers]], who first derived the form in 1923.<ref name=\"Carroll274\">Carroll (1996), p. 274.</ref>\n\n==== Electron spin (1925) ====\nIn 1925, Dutch physicists [[George Eugene Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] co-discovered the concept of [[electron spin]], which posits an intrinsic [[angular momentum]] for all electrons.\n\n==== Solidification of helium (1926) ====\nIn 1926, Onnes' student, Dutch physicist [[Willem Hendrik Keesom]], invented a method\nto freeze [[liquid helium]] and was the first person who was able to solidify the noble gas.\n\n==== Ehrenfest theorem (1927) ====\nThe [[Ehrenfest theorem]], named after the Austrian-born [[Dutch Jew|Dutch-Jew]] theoretical physicist [[Paul Ehrenfest]] at [[Leiden University]].\n\n==== De Haas\u2013van Alphen effect (1930) ====\nThe [[de Haas\u2013van Alphen effect]], often abbreviated to dHvA, is a [[quantum mechanical]] effect in which the [[magnetic moment]] of a pure metal [[crystal]] oscillates as the intensity of an applied [[magnetic field]] B is increased. It was discovered in 1930 by [[Wander Johannes de Haas]] and his student P. M. van Alphen.\n\n==== Shubnikov\u2013de Haas effect (1930) ====\nThe [[Shubnikov\u2013de Haas effect]] (ShdH) is named after Dutch physicist [[Wander Johannes de Haas]] and Russian physicist [[Lev Shubnikov]].\n\n==== Kramers degeneracy theorem (1930) ====\nIn quantum mechanics, the [[Kramers theorem|Kramers degeneracy theorem]] states that for every energy eigenstate of a [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetric]] system with half-integer total spin, there is at least one more eigenstate with the same energy. It was first discovered in 1930 by [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|H. A. Kramers]]<ref>Kramers, H. A., Proc. Amsterdam Acad. 33, 959 (1930)</ref> as a consequence of the [[Breit equation]].\n\n==== Minnaert resonance frequency (1933) ====\nIn 1933, [[Marcel Minnaert]] published a solution for the [[Acoustics|acoustic]] [[resonance frequency]] of a single [[Liquid bubble|bubble]] in [[water]], the so-called [[Minnaert resonance]]. The [[Minnaert resonance]] or [[Minnaert frequency]]<ref>{{Citation |last=Minnaert |first=M. |authorlink=Marcel Minnaert |year=1933 |title=On musical air-bubbles and the sound of running water |journal=Philosophical Magazine |volume=16 |issue=104 |pages=235\u201348 |doi=10.1080/14786443309462277}}</ref> is the [[acoustic resonance|acoustic]] [[resonance]] frequency of a single bubble in an infinite domain of water (neglecting the effects of [[surface tension]] and [[Viscosity|viscous]] [[attenuation]]).\n\n==== Casimir effect (1948) ====\nIn quantum field theory, the [[Casimir effect]] and the [[Casimir\u2013Polder force]] are physical forces arising from a quantized field. Dutch physicists [[Hendrik Casimir]] and [[Dirk Polder]] at Philips Research Labs proposed the existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947. After a conversation with [[Niels Bohr]] who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948; the former is called the Casimir\u2013Polder force while the latter is the Casimir effect in the narrow sense.\n\n==== Tellegen's theorem (1952) ====\n[[Tellegen's theorem]] is one of the most powerful theorems in [[network theory]]. Most of the energy distribution theorems and extremum principles in network theory can be derived from it. It was published in 1952 by [[Bernard Tellegen]]. Fundamentally, Tellegen's theorem gives a simple relation between magnitudes that satisfy [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's laws]] of [[electrical circuit theory]].\n\n==== Stochastic cooling (1970s) ====\nIn the early 1970s [[Simon van der Meer]], a Dutch particle physicist at [[CERN]], discovered this technique to concentrate proton and anti-proton beams, leading to the discovery of the [[W particle|W]] and [[Z particle]]s. He won the 1984 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] together with [[Carlo Rubbia]].\n\n==== Renormalization of gauge theories (1971) ====\nIn 1971, [[Gerardus 't Hooft]], who was completing his PhD under the supervision of Dutch theoretical physicist [[Martinus Veltman]], [[renormalization|renormalized]] [[Yang\u2013Mills theory]]. They showed that if the symmetries of Yang\u2013Mills theory were to be realized in the [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] mode, referred to as the Higgs mechanism, then Yang\u2013Mills theory can be renormalized.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=G.

''Home: A Short History of an Idea''. According to [[Witold Rybczynski]]\u2019s ''[[Home: A Short History of an Idea]]'', private spaces in households are a Dutch seventeenth-century invention, despite their commonplace nature today. He has argued that home as we now know it came from the Dutch canal house of the seventeenth century. That, he said, was the first time that people identified living quarters as being precisely the residence of a man, a woman and their children. \"The feminization of the home in seventeenth century Holland was one of the most important events in the evolution of the domestic interior.\" This evolution took place in part due to Dutch law being \"explicit on contractual arrangements and on the civil rights of servants\". And, \"for the first time, the person who was in intimate contact with housework was also in a position to influence the arrangement and disposition of the house.\" <br /> Rybczynski (2007) discusses why we live in houses in the first place: \"To understand why we live in [[house]]s, it is necessary to go back several hundred years to Europe. Rural people have always lived in houses, but the typical medieval town dwelling, which combined living space and workplace, was occupied by a mixture of extended families, servants, and employees. This changed in seventeenth-century Holland. [[Dutch Republic|The Netherlands]] was Europe\u2019s first republic, and the world\u2019s first middle-class nation. Prosperity allowed extensive [[home]] ownership, [[republicanism]] discouraged the widespread use of servants, a love of children promoted the [[nuclear family]], and [[Calvinism]] encouraged thrift and other domestic virtues. These circumstances, coupled with a particular affection for the private family home, brought about a [[cultural revolution]]... The idea of urban houses spread to the British Isles thanks to England's strong commercial and cultural links with the Netherlands.\"</ref><ref name=\"Tabor, Philip 2005\">Tabor, Philip (2005). \"Striking Home: The Telematic Assault on Identity\". Published in [[Jonathan Hill (architect)|Jonathan Hill]], editor, ''Occupying Architecture: Between the Architect and the User''. Philip Tabor states the contribution of 17th century Dutch houses as the foundation of houses today: \"As far as the idea of the home is concerned, the home of the home is the Netherlands. This idea's crystallization might be dated to the first three-quarters of the seventeenth century, when the Dutch Netherlands amassed the unprecedented and unrivalled accumulation of capital, and emptied their purses into domestic space.\" <br /> According to [[Jonathan Hill (architect)|Jonathan Hill]] (''Immaterial Architecture'', 2006), compared to the large scaled houses in England and the Renaissance, the [[Dutch Golden Age|17th Century Dutch]] house was smaller, and was only inhabited by up to four to five members. This was due to their embracing \"self-reliance\", in contrast to the dependence on servants, and a design for a lifestyle centered on the [[family]]. It was important for the Dutch to separate work from domesticity, as the [[home]] became an escape and a place of [[comfort]]. This way of living and the home has been noted as highly similar to the [[contemporary]] family and their dwellings. House layouts also incorporated the idea of the corridor as well as the importance of function and privacy. By the end of the 17th Century, the house layout was soon transformed to become employment-free, enforcing these ideas for the future. This came in favour for the industrial revolution, gaining large-scale factory production and workers. The house layout of the Dutch and its functions are still relevant today.</ref> The [[Netherlands]]<ref>including the Dutch-speaking [[Southern Netherlands]] prior to [[Fall of Antwerp|1585]]</ref> and [[History of Dutch nationality|its people]] have made numerous seminal contributions to the world's civilization,<ref>Taylor, Peter J.

Royal absolutism became the main tendency of the time. The kings of Europe raised a novel claim: they declared that they were appointed by God to be the fountainhead of all life and activity in society. Accordingly, they sought to direct religion, culture, politics, and, especially, the economic life of the people. To support their burgeoning bureaucracies and constant wars, the rulers required ever-increasing quantities of taxes, which they tried to squeeze out of their subjects in ways that were contrary to precedent and custom. <br /> The first people to revolt against this system were the Dutch. After a struggle that lasted for decades, they won their independence from Spain and proceeded to set up a unique polity. The United Provinces, as the radically decentralized state was called, had no king and little power at the federal level. Making money was the passion of these busy manufacturers and traders; they had no time for hunting heretics or suppressing new ideas. Thus de facto religious toleration and a wide-ranging freedom of the press came to prevail. Devoted to industry and trade, the Dutch established a legal system based solidly on the rule of law and the sanctity of property and contract. Taxes were low, and everyone worked. The Dutch \"economic miracle\" was the wonder of the age. Thoughtful observers throughout Europe noted the Dutch success with great interest. |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russellshorto.com/book/amsterdam |author=[[Russell Shorto|Shorto, Russell]] |title=Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City (overview) |publisher=russellshorto.com |quote=Liberalism has many meanings, but in its classical sense it is a philosophy based on individual freedom.

''The Britannica Guide to Inventions That Changed the Modern World''</ref> economics and finance,<ref>During their [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]], the Dutch were responsible for three major institutional innovations in [[Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815)|economic]] and [[Financial history of the Dutch Republic|financial history]]. The first major innovation was the foundation of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), the world's first [[publicly traded company]], in 1602. As the first [[listed company]] (the first company to be ever [[Listing (finance)|listed]] on an official [[stock exchange]]), the VOC was the first company to actually issue [[stock]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to the general public. Considered by many experts to be the world's first truly (modern) [[multinational corporation]], the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] was also the first permanently organized [[limited liability company|limited-liability]] [[joint-stock company]], with a permanent [[Financial capital|capital]] base. The Dutch merchants were the pioneers in laying the basis for modern [[corporate governance]]. The VOC is often considered as the precursor of modern [[corporation]]s, if not the first truly modern corporation. It was the VOC that invented the idea of investing in the company rather than in a specific venture governed by the company. With its pioneering features such as [[corporate identity]] (first globally-recognized [[corporate logo]]), entrepreneurial spirit, [[legal personality|legal personhood]], [[transnational corporation|transnational]] ([[multinational corporation|multinational]]) operational structure, high stable profitability, permanent [[Financial capital|capital]] (fixed capital stock), freely transferable [[Share (finance)|shares]] and [[securities trading|tradable securities]], separation of [[ownership]] and [[management]], and [[limited liability]] for both [[shareholder]]s and managers, the VOC is generally considered a major institutional breakthrough and the model for the large-scale business enterprises that now dominate the global economy. <br /> The second major innovation was the creation of the world's first fully functioning [[financial market]], with the birth of a fully fledged [[capital market]]. The Dutch were also the first to effectively use a fully-fledged [[capital market]] (including the [[bond market]] and the [[stock market]]) to finance [[companies]] (such as the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] and the [[Dutch West India Company|WIC]]). It was in seventeenth-century Amsterdam that the global [[securities market]] began to take on its modern form. In 1602 the Dutch East India Company ([[Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie|VOC]]) established an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] in [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|Amsterdam]] where VOC [[stock]] and [[bond (finance)|bonds]] could be traded in a [[secondary market]]. The VOC undertook the world's first recorded [[IPO]] in the same year. The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] (''Amsterdamsche Beurs'' in Dutch) was also the world's first fully-fledged [[stock exchange]]. While the [[Italian city-states]] produced the first transferable government bonds, they didn't develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged [[capital market]]: corporate shareholders. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first [[company]] to offer [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]]. The dividend averaged around 18% of capital over the course of the company's 200-year existence. Dutch investors were the first to trade their [[Share (finance)|shares]] at a regular [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|stock exchange]]. The buying and selling of these [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]] in the VOC became the basis of the first [[stock market]]. It was in the [[Dutch Republic]] that the early techniques of [[market manipulation|stock-market manipulation]] were developed. The Dutch pioneered [[Futures contract|stock futures]], [[stock options]], [[short selling]], [[bear raid]]s, debt-equity swaps, and other [[speculation|speculative instruments]]. Amsterdam businessman [[Joseph de la Vega]]'s ''Confusion of Confusions'' (1688) was the earliest book about [[stock trading]]. <br /> The third major innovation was the establishment of the [[Bank of Amsterdam]] ([[Amsterdamsche Wisselbank]] in Dutch) in 1609, which led to the introduction of the concept of [[bank money]]. The [[Bank of Amsterdam]] was arguably the world's first [[central bank]]. The Wisselbank's innovations helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the [[central banking|central banking system]] that now plays a vital role in the world's economy. It occupied a central position in the financial world of its day, providing an effective, efficient and trusted system for national and international payments, and introduced the first ever [[international reserve currency]], the [[Dutch guilder|bank guilder]]. Lucien Gillard (2004) calls it the ''European guilder'' (''le florin europ\u00e9en''), and [[Adam Smith]] devotes many pages to explaining how the bank guilder works (Smith 1776: 446\u201355). The model of the Wisselbank as a [[state bank]] was adapted throughout Europe, including the [[Bank of Sweden]] (1668) and the [[Bank of England]] (1694).</ref><ref>De Vries, Jan; Woude, Ad van der (1997).

Because of centuries of cohabitation and active participation in Dutch society, as well as being bilingual, the Frisians are not treated as a separate group in Dutch official statistics.</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Discoveries ==\n=== Archaeology ===\n\n==== Java Man (Homo erectus erectus) (1891) ====\n[[File:Pithecanthropus-erectus.jpg|thumb|Original fossils of ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' (now ''Homo erectus'') found in Java in 1891. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, at the time of their discovery the fossils of \"[[Java Man]]\" were the oldest [[hominin]] fossils ever found.]]\n[[Java Man]] (''Homo erectus erectus'') is the name given to hominid fossils discovered in 1891 at [[Trinil]] \u2013 [[Ngawi Regency]] on the banks of the Solo River in [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]], one of the first known specimens of [[Homo erectus]]. Its discoverer, Dutch paleontologist [[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]], gave it the scientific name '''Pithecanthropus erectus''', a name derived from Greek and Latin roots meaning ''upright ape-man''.\n\n=== Astronomy ===\n==== Columba (constellation) (1592) ====\n\n[[Constellation Columba|Columba]] is a small, faint [[constellation]] named in the late sixteenth century. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[dove]]. It is located just south of [[Canis Major]] and [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]]. Columba was named by Dutch astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]] in 1592 in order to differentiate the 'unformed stars' of the large constellation [[Canis Major]]. Plancius first depicted Columba on the small celestial planispheres of his large wall map of 1592. It is also shown on his smaller world map of 1594 and on early Dutch celestial globes.\n\n==== Novaya Zemlya effect (1597) ====\nThe first person to record the [[Novaya Zemlya effect]] was [[Gerrit de Veer]], a member of [[Willem Barentsz]]' ill-fated third expedition into the polar region. [[Novaya Zemlya]], the [[archipelago]] where de Veer first observed the phenomenon, lends its name to the effect.\n\n==== 12 southern constellations (1597\u20131598) ====\nPlancius defined 12 constellations created by Plancius from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]].<ref name=\"Ridpath, Ian 1988 p. 9\u201310\">Ridpath, Ian (1988).

''A Dictionary of Astronomy (Oxford Paperback Reference)'', p. 96</ref>\n* ''[[Apus]]'' is a faint constellation in the [[southern sky]], first defined in the late 16th century. Its name means \"no feet\" in Greek, and it represents a [[bird-of-paradise]] (once believed to lack feet). It first appeared on a 35&nbsp;cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].\n* ''[[Chamaeleon]]'' is named after the [[chameleon]], a kind of [[lizard]].\n* ''[[Dorado]]'' is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Dorado has been represented historically as a [[dolphinfish]] and a [[swordfish]].\n* ''[[Grus (constellation)|Grus]]'' is Latin for the [[crane (bird)|crane]], a species of bird. The stars that form Grus were originally considered part of [[Piscis Austrinus]] (the southern fish).\n* ''[[Hydrus]]''' name means \"male water snake\".\n* ''[[Indus (constellation)|Indus]]'' represents an Indian, a word that could refer at the time to any native of Asia or the Americas.\n* ''[[Musca]]'' is one of the minor southern constellations. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.\n* ''[[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]]'' is [[Latin]] for [[peacock]].\n* ''[[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]]'' is a minor southern constellation, named after the mythical [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]. It was the largest of the twelve.\n* ''[[Triangulum Australe]]'' is Latin for \"the southern triangle\", which distinguishes it from [[Triangulum]] in the northern sky and is derived from the almost equilateral pattern of its three brightest stars. It was first depicted on a [[celestial globe]] as Triangulus Antarcticus by Plancius in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by [[Johann Bayer]] in his 1603 ''Uranometria''.\n* ''[[Tucana]]'' is Latin for the [[toucan]], a South American bird.\n* ''[[Volans]]'' represents a [[flying fish]]; its name is a shortened form of its original name, ''Piscis Volans''.\n\n==== Camelopardalis (constellation) (1612\u20131613) ====\n''Camelopardalis'' was created by Plancius in 1613 to represent the animal [[Rebecca]] rode to marry [[Isaac]] in [[the Bible]]. One year later, [[Jakob Bartsch]] featured it in his atlas. [[Johannes Hevelius]] gave it the official name of \"Camelopardus\" or \"Camelopardalis\" because he saw the [[constellation]]'s many faint stars as the spots of a [[giraffe]].\n\n==== Monoceros (constellation) (1612\u20131613) ====\n''Monoceros'' is a relatively modern creation. Its first certain appearance was on a globe created by Plancius in 1612 or 1613. It was later charted by Bartsch as ''Unicornus'' in his 1624 star chart.\n\n==== Rings of Saturn (1655) ====\n[[Image:Unraveling Saturn's Rings.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first person to describe [[Rings of Saturn|Saturn's rings]] as a disk surrounding [[Saturn]]]]\n\nIn 1655, Huygens became the first person to suggest that Saturn was surrounded by a ring, after Galileo's much less advanced telescope had failed to show rings. Galileo had reported the anomaly as possibly 3 planets instead of one.\n\n==== Titan (Saturn's moon) (1655) ====\n[[Image:Titan in natural color Cassini.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] was the first known [[Moons of Saturn|moon of Saturn]], discovered in 1655 by [[Christiaan Huygens]].]]\n\nIn 1655, using a 50 power [[refracting telescope]] that he designed himself, Huygens discovered the first of [[Saturn]]'s moons, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].\n\n==== Kapteyn's Star (1897) ====\n[[Kapteyn's Star]] is a [[Stellar classification|class M1]] [[red dwarf]] about 12.76 [[light year]]s from Earth in the southern [[constellation]] [[Pictor]], and the closest [[galactic halo|halo]] star to the Solar System. With a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of nearly 9 it is visible through [[binoculars]] or a [[telescope]]. It had the highest [[proper motion]] of any star known until the discovery of [[Barnard's Star]] in 1916. Attention was first drawn to what is now known as [[Kapteyn's Star]] by the Dutch astronomer [[Jacobus Kapteyn]], in 1897.\n\n==== Discovery of evidence for galactic rotation (1904) ====\nIn 1904, studying the [[proper motion]]s of stars, Dutch astronomer [[Jacobus Kapteyn]] reported that these were not random, as it was believed in that time; stars could be divided into two streams, moving in nearly opposite directions. It was later realized that Kapteyn's data had been the first evidence of the rotation of our [[Galaxy]], which ultimately led to the finding of [[Galaxy rotation curve|galactic rotation]] by [[Bertil Lindblad]] and [[Jan Oort]].\n\n==== Galactic halo (1924) ====\nIn 1924, Dutch astronomer [[Jan Oort]] [[:Category:Discoveries by Jan Oort|discovered]] the [[galactic halo]], a group of stars orbiting the [[Milky Way]] but outside the main disk.\n\n==== Oort constants (1927) ====\nThe [[Oort constants]] (discovered by [[Jan Oort]]) <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are empirically derived parameters that characterize the local rotational properties of the [[Milky Way]].\n\n==== Evidence of dark matter (1932) ====\nIn 1932, Dutch astronomer [[Jan Oort]] became the first person to discover evidence of [[dark matter]]. Oort proposed the substance after measuring the motions of nearby stars in the [[Milky Way]] relative to the galactic plane. He found that the mass of the galactic plane must be more than the mass of the material that can be seen. A year later (1933), [[Fritz Zwicky]] examined the dynamics of clusters of galaxies and found their movements similarly perplexing.\n\n==== Discovery of methane in the atmosphere of Titan (1944) ====\nThe first formal proof of the existence of an [[Atmosphere of Titan|atmosphere]] around [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] came in 1944, when [[Gerald Kuiper]] observed Titan with the new McDonald {{convert|82|in|m|adj=on}} telescope and discovered spectral signatures on Titan at wavelengths longer than 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm (micrometers), among which he identified two absorption bands of [[methane]] at 6190 and 7250&nbsp;\u00c5 (Kuiper1944). This discovery was significant not only because it requires a dense [[atmosphere]] with a significant fraction of methane, but also because the atmosphere needs to be chemically evolved, since methane requires [[hydrogen]] in the presence of [[carbon]], and molecular and atomic hydrogen would have escaped from Titan's weak gravitational field since the formation of the [[solar system]].<ref>Brown, Robert Hanbury; Lebreton, Jean-Pierre; Waite, John H. (2009). ''Titan from Cassini-Huygens'', p. 10</ref>\n\n==== Discovery of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Mars (1947) ====\nUsing [[infrared]] spectrometry, in 1947 the Dutch-American astronomer [[Gerard Kuiper]] detected [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]], a discovery of biological significance because it is a principal [[gas]] in the process of [[photosynthesis]] (see also: [[History of Mars observation]]). He was able to estimate that the amount of carbon dioxide over a given area of the surface is double that on the [[Earth]].\n\n==== Miranda (Uranus's moon) (1948) ====\n[[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]] is the smallest and innermost of [[Uranus]]'s five major moons. It was discovered by [[Gerard Kuiper]] on 16 February 1948 at [[McDonald Observatory]].\n\n==== Nereid (Neptune's moon) (1949) ====\n[[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]], also known as Neptune II, is the third-largest [[natural satellite|moon]] of [[Neptune]] and was its second moon to be discovered, on 1 May 1949, by Gerard Kuiper, on photographic plates taken with the 82-inch telescope at McDonald Observatory.\n\n==== Oort cloud (1950) ====\nThe ''[[Oort cloud]]'' or ''\u00d6pik\u2013Oort cloud'', named after Dutch astronomer [[Jan Oort]] and Estonian astronomer [[Ernst \u00d6pik]], is a spherical cloud of predominantly [[volatiles|icy]] [[planetesimal]]s believed to surround the [[Sun]] at a distance of up to {{convert|50,000|AU|ly|abbr=on|lk=on|sigfig=1}}. Further evidence for the existence of the [[Kuiper belt]] emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their [[volatility (physics)|volatile]] surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually evaporating them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently.<ref name=\"matter\">{{cite journal | author=David Jewitt | title=From Kuiper Belt Object to Cometary Nucleus: The Missing Ultrared Matter | journal=[[The Astronomical Journal]] | volume=123 | issue=2 | pages=1039\u201349 | year=2002 | doi=10.1086/338692 | bibcode=2002AJ....123.1039J}}</ref> One such area of replenishment is the [[Oort cloud]], a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer [[:Category:Discoveries by Jan Oort|Jan Oort]] in 1950.<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1950BAN....11...91O |title=The structure of the cloud of comets surrounding the Solar System and a hypothesis concerning its origin |author1=Oort |first1=J.

In 1951, he proposed the existence of what is now called the [[Kuiper Belt]], a disk-shaped region of [[minor planets]] outside the orbit of [[Neptune]], which also is a source of short-period [[comet]]s.\n\n=== Biology ===\n==== Foundations of modern reproductive biology (1660s \u20131670s) ====\n\nIn the 1660s and 1670s the [[Dutch Republic]]-based scientists (in particular [[Leiden University]]-based [[Jan Swammerdam]] and [[Nicolas Steno]], and [[Delft]]-based [[Regnier de Graaf]] and [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]) made key discoveries about [[animal reproduction|animal]] and [[human reproduction]]. Their research and discoveries contributed greatly to the modern understanding of the female [[mammalian]] [[reproductive system]].<ref>Cobb, Matthew (2006). ''Generation: The Seventeenth-Century Scientists Who Unraveled the Secrets of Sex, Life, and Growth''. (New York: Bloomsbury)</ref> Many authors see [[Regnier de Graaf]] as the founder of modern [[reproductive biology]] (Setchell, 1974).<ref>Setchell, B. P. (1974) \"The Contributions of Regnier de Graaf to Reproductive Biology,\" ''European Journal of Gynecology and Reproductive Biology'', Volume 4, Issue 1, p. 1\u201339, 1974</ref> This is due essentially to his use of convergent scientific methods: meticulous dissections, clinical observations and critical analysis of the available literature (Ankumet al., 1996).<ref>Hunter, R. H. F. (2003). ''Physiology of the Graafian Follicle and Ovulation''. (Cambridge University Press)</ref>\n\n==== Function of the Fallopian tubes (1660s) ====\nDutch physician & anatomist [[Regnier de Graaf]] may have been the first to understand the reproductive function of the [[Fallopian tube]]s. He described the [[hydrosalpinx]], linking its development to female [[infertility]]. de Graaf recognized pathologic conditions of the tubes. He was aware of tubal pregnancies, and he surmised that the mammalian egg traveled from the [[ovary]] to the [[uterus]] through the tube.\n\n==== Development of ovarian follicles (1672) ====\nIn his ''De Mulierum Organis Generatione Inservientibus'' (1672), de Graaf provided the first thorough description of the female [[gonad]] and established that it produced the [[ovum]]. De Graaf used the terminology [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]] or egg (ovum) for what now called the [[ovarian follicle]]. Because the fluid-filled ovarian vesicles had been observed previously by others, including [[Andreas Vesalius]] and [[Falloppio]], De Graaf did not claim their discovery. He noted that he was not the first to describe them, but to describe their development. De Graaf was the first to observe changes in the ovary before and after mating and describe the [[corpus luteum]]. From the observation of [[pregnancy]] in rabbits, he concluded that the follicle contained the [[oocyte]]. The mature stage of the ovarian follicle is called the [[Graafian follicle]] in his honour, although others, including [[Fallopius]], had noticed it previously but failed to recognize its reproductive significance.\n\n==== Foundations of microbiology (discovery of microorganisms) (1670s) ====\n[[Image:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723).

Ultimately, nearly all living things depend on energy produced from photosynthesis. It is also responsible for producing the [[oxygen]] that makes animal life possible. Organisms that produce energy through photosynthesis are called [[photoautotroph]]s. Plants are the most visible representatives of photoautotrophs, but bacteria and algae also employ the process.\n\n==== Plant respiration (1779) ====\nPlant respiration was also discovered by Ingenhousz in 1779.\n\n==== Foundations of virology (1898) ====\n[[Martinus Beijerinck]] is considered one of the founders of [[History of virology|virology]]. In 1898, he published results on his filtration experiments, demonstrating that [[tobacco mosaic disease]] is caused by an infectious agent smaller than a bacterium. His results were in accordance with similar observations made by [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] in 1892. Like Ivanovsky and [[Adolf Mayer]], predecessor at [[Wageningen]], Beijerinck could not culture the filterable infectious agent. He concluded that the agent can replicate and multiply in living plants. He named the new [[pathogen]] ''[[virus]]'' to indicate its non-bacterial nature. This discovery is considered to be the beginning of [[virology]].\n\n==== Chemistry of photosynthesis (1931) ====\nIn 1931, [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]] made key discoveries explaining the [[chemistry]] of [[photosynthesis]]. By studying [[purple sulfur bacteria]] and [[green sulfur bacteria]], he was the first scientist to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a [[Light-dependent reaction|light-dependent]] [[redox]] reaction, in which [[hydrogen]] reduces [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>Stenesh, J. (1998). ''Biochemistry'', p. 377</ref><ref>Khanna, Pragya (2008). ''Cell and Molecular Biology'', p. 151</ref> Expressed as:\n:2 H<sub>2</sub>A + CO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2A + CH<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nwhere A is the [[electron acceptor]]. His discovery predicted that H<sub>2</sub>O is the hydrogen donor in green plant photosynthesis and is oxidized to O<sub>2</sub>. The chemical summation of photosynthesis was a milestone in the understanding of the chemistry of photosynthesis. This was later experimentally verified by [[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robert Hill]].\n\n==== Foundations of modern ethology (Tinbergen's four questions) (1930s) ====\nMany [[naturalists]] have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history. [[Ethology]] has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, and Wallace Craig. The modern discipline of [[ethology]] is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and by Austrian biologists [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]].<ref>Burkhardt, Jr., Richard W. (2005). ''Patterns of Behavior: Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and the Founding of Ethology''. (University of Chicago Press)</ref>\n\n[[Tinbergen's four questions]], named after [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], one of the founders of modern [[ethology]], are complementary categories of explanations for behaviour. It suggests that an integrative understanding of behaviour must include both a proximate and ultimate (functional) analysis of behaviour, as well as an understanding of both phylogenetic/developmental history and the operation of current mechanisms.<ref>Daly, M & Wilson, M. (1983). Sex, evolution, and behaviour. Brooks-Cole.</ref>\n\n==== Vroman effect (1975) ====\nThe [[Vroman effect]], named after [[Leo Vroman]], is exhibited by [[protein]] [[adsorption]] to a surface by [[blood plasma|blood serum]] proteins.\n\n=== Chemistry ===\n==== Concept of gas (1600s) ====\n\nFlemish physician [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] is sometimes considered the founder of [[pneumatic chemistry]], coining the word ''[[gas]]'' and conducting experiments involving gases. Van Helmont had derived the word \u201cgas\u201d from the Dutch word ''geest'', which means ghost or spirit.\n\n==== Foundations of stereochemistry (1874) ====\nDutch chemist [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] is generally considered to be one of the founders of the field of [[stereochemistry]]. In 1874, [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|Van 't Hoff]] built on the work on isomers of German chemist [[Johannes Wislicenus]], and showed that the four valencies of the [[carbon atom]] were probably directed in space toward the four corners of a regular tetrahedron, a model which explained how optical activity could be associated with an asymmetric carbon atom. He shares credit for this with the French chemist [[Joseph Le Bel]], who independently came up with the same idea. Three months before his doctoral degree was awarded Van 't Hoff published this theory, which today is regarded as the foundation of [[stereochemistry]], first in a Dutch pamphlet in the fall of 1874, and then in the following May in a small French book entitled ''La chimie dans l'espace''. A German translation appeared in 1877, at a time when the only job Van 't Hoff could find was at the Veterinary School in [[Utrecht]]. In these early years his theory was largely ignored by the scientific community, and was sharply criticized by one prominent chemist, [[Hermann Kolbe]]. However, by about 1880 support for Van 't Hoff's theory by such important chemists as [[Johannes Wislicenus]] and [[Viktor Meyer]] brought recognition.\n\n==== Foundations of modern physical chemistry (1880s) ====\n[[Jacobus van 't Hoff]] is also considered as one of the modern founders of the disciple of [[physical chemistry]].<ref>[[Keith J. Laidler|Laidler, Keith J.]]. ''Chemical Kinetics and the Origins of Physical Chemistry''. (''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'', March 1985, Volume 32, Issue 1, p. 43\u201375)</ref> The first scientific journal specifically in the field of physical chemistry was the German journal, ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie'', founded in 1887 by [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] and Van 't Hoff. Together with [[Svante Arrhenius]], these were the leading figures in physical chemistry in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\n==== Van 't Hoff equation (1884) ====\nThe [[Van 't Hoff equation]] in [[chemical thermodynamics]] relates the change in the [[equilibrium constant]], ''K<sub>eq</sub>'', of a chemical equilibrium to the change in [[temperature]], ''T'', given the [[Enthalpy of formation|standard enthalpy change]], ''\u0394H<sup><s>o</s></sup>'', for the process. It was proposed by Dutch chemist [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] in 1884.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/hoff-bio.html Biography on Nobel prize website]. Nobelprize.org (1911-03-01). Retrieved on 2013-11-8.</ref> The ''Van 't Hoff equation'' has been widely utilized to explore the changes in [[state functions]] in a [[thermodynamic system]]. The ''Van 't Hoff plot'', which is derived from this equation, is especially effective in estimating the change in [[enthalpy]], or total energy, and [[entropy]], or amount of disorder, of a [[chemical reaction]].\n\n==== Van 't Hoff factor (1884) ====\nThe '''van 't Hoff factor <math> i </math>''' is a measure of the effect of a solute upon [[colligative properties]] such as [[osmotic pressure]], relative lowering in [[vapor pressure]], [[Boiling-point elevation|elevation of boiling point]] and [[freezing point depression]]. The [[van 't Hoff factor]] is the ratio between the actual concentration of particles produced when the substance is dissolved, and the [[concentration]] of a substance as calculated from its mass.\n\n==== Lobry de Bruyn\u2013van Ekenstein transformation (1885) ====\nIn [[carbohydrate chemistry]], the [[Lobry de Bruyn\u2013van Ekenstein transformation]] is the base or acid-catalyzed transformation of an [[aldose]] into the [[ketose isomer]] or vice versa, with a tautomeric [[enediol]] as reaction intermediate. The transformation is relevant for the industrial production of certain [[ketose]]s and was discovered in 1885 by [[Cornelis Adriaan Lobry van Troostenburg de Bruyn]] and [[Willem Alberda van Ekenstein]].\n\n==== Prins reaction (1919) ====\nThe Prins reaction is an [[organic reaction]] consisting of an [[electrophilic addition]] of an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] to an [[alkene]] or [[alkyne]] followed by capture of a [[nucleophile]]. Dutch chemist Hendrik Jacobus Prins discovered two new [[organic reaction]]s, both now carrying the name [[Prins reaction]]. The first was the addition of [[polyhalogen]] compounds to [[olefin]]s, was found during Prins doctoral research, while the others, the acid-catalyzed addition of aldehydes to olefinic compounds, became of industrial relevance.\n\n==== Hafnium (1923) ====\nDutch physicist [[Dirk Coster]] and Hungarian-Swedish chemist [[George de Hevesy]] co-discovered ''[[Hafnium]]'' (Hf) in 1923, by means of [[X-ray]] spectroscopic analysis of [[zirconium]] ore. ''Hafnium' is named after ''Hafnia', the Latin name for [[Copenhagen]] (Denmark), where it was discovered.\n\n==== Crystal bar process (1925) ====\nThe [[crystal bar process]] (also known as ''iodide process'' or the ''van Arkel\u2013de Boer process'') was developed by Dutch chemists [[Anton Eduard van Arkel]] and [[Jan Hendrik de Boer]] in 1925. It was the first industrial process for the commercial production of pure ductile metallic [[zirconium]]. It is used in the production of small quantities of ultra-pure [[titanium]] and zirconium.\n\n==== Koopmans' theorem (1934) ====\n[[Koopmans' theorem]] states that in closed-shell [[Hartree\u2013Fock theory]], the first [[ionization energy]] of a molecular system is equal to the negative of the orbital energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital ([[HOMO]]). This theorem is named after [[Tjalling Koopmans]], who published this result in 1934.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Koopmans\n | first = Tjalling\n | title = \u00dcber die Zuordnung von Wellenfunktionen und Eigenwerten zu den einzelnen Elektronen eines Atoms\n | journal = Physica\n | year = 1934\n | volume = 1\n | issue = 1\u20136\n | pages = 104\u201313\n | publisher = Elsevier\n | doi = 10.1016/S0031-8914(34)90011-2\n| bibcode=1934Phy.....1..104K}}\n</ref>\nKoopmans became a [[Nobel laureate]] in 1975, though neither in physics nor chemistry, but in [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|economics]].\n\n=== Genetics ===\n==== Concept of pangene/gene (1889) ====\n\nIn 1889, Dutch botanist [[Hugo de Vries]] published his book ''Intracellular Pangenesis'', in which he postulated that different characters have different hereditary carriers, based on a modified version of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[Pangenesis]] of 1868. He specifically postulated that inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in ''particles''. He called these units ''pangenes'', a term shortened in 1909 to [[gene]]s by Danish botanist [[Wilhelm Johannsen]].\n\n==== Rediscovery the laws of inheritance (1900) ====\n1900 marked the \"rediscovery of [[Mendelian genetics]]\". The significance of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work was not understood until early in the twentieth century, after his death, when his research was re-discovered by [[Hugo de Vries]], [[Carl Correns]] and [[Erich von Tschermak]], who were working on similar problems.<ref>Kuiper, Kathleen (2010). ''The Britannica Guide to Theories and Ideas That Changed the Modern World'', p. 56</ref> They were unaware of Mendel's work. They worked independently on different plant hybrids, and came to Mendel's conclusions about the rules of [[inheritance]].\n\n=== Geology ===\n==== Bushveld Igneous Complex (1897) ====\n\nThe [[Bushveld Igneous Complex]] (or BIC) is a large, layered igneous intrusion within the Earth's crust that has been tilted and eroded and now outcrops around what appears to be the edge of a great geological basin, the [[Transvaal Basin]]. Located in South Africa, the BIC contains some of Earth's richest [[ore deposit]]s. The complex contains the world's largest reserves of [[platinum group metals]] (PGMs), [[platinum]], [[palladium]], [[osmium]], [[iridium]], [[rhodium]], and [[ruthenium]], along with vast quantities of iron, [[tin]], [[chromium]], [[titanium]] and [[vanadium]]. The site was discovered around 1897 by Dutch geologist [[Gustaaf Molengraaff]].\n\n=== Mathematics ===\n==== Analytic geometry (1637) ====\n\nDescartes (1596\u20131650) was born in France, but spent most of his adult life in the Dutch Republic. As [[Bertrand Russell]] noted in his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945): \"He lived in [[Holland]] for twenty years (1629\u201349), except for a few brief visits to France and one to England, all on business....\". In 1637, Descartes published his work on the methods of science, ''[[Discourse on the Method|Discours de la m\u00e9thode]]'' in Leiden. One of its three appendices was ''[[La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]]'', in which he outlined a method to connect the expressions of [[algebra]] with the [[diagram]]s of [[geometry]]. It combined both algebra and geometry under one specialty  \u2013  [[algebraic geometry]], now called [[analytic geometry]], which involves reducing geometry to a form of [[arithmetic]] and algebra and translating geometric shapes into [[algebraic equation]]s.\n\n==== Cartesian coordinate system (1637) ====\nDescartes' ''La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie'' contains Descartes' first introduction of the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\n==== Differential geometry of curves (concepts of the involute and evolute of a curve) (1673) ====\n[[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to publish in 1673 (''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'') a specific method of determining the [[evolute]] and [[involute]] of a [[curve]]<ref>Ungs, Michael (2010). ''The Theory of Quantum Torus Knots: Its Foundation in Differential Geometry'', Volume II, p. 334</ref>\n\n==== Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation (1895) ====\nIn [[mathematics]], the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]] ('''KdV equation''' for short) is a [[mathematical model]] of waves on shallow water surfaces. It is particularly notable as the prototypical example of an [[exactly solvable model]], that is, a non-linear [[partial differential equation]] whose solutions can be exactly and precisely specified. The equation is named for [[Diederik Korteweg]] and [[Gustav de Vries]] who, in 1895, proposed a mathematical model which allowed to predict the waves behaviour on shallow water surfaces.<ref>De Gloria, Alessandro (2014). ''Applications in Electronics Pervading Industry, Environment and Society'', p. 91</ref>\n\n==== Proof of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem (1911) ====\n[[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] is a [[fixed-point theorem]] in [[topology]], named after Dutchman [[L. E. J. Brouwer|Luitzen Brouwer]], who proved it in 1911.\n\n==== Proof of the hairy ball theorem (1912) ====\nThe [[hairy ball theorem]] of [[algebraic topology]] states that there is no nonvanishing [[continuous function|continuous]] tangent [[vector field]] on even-dimensional [[n\u2011sphere|''n''-spheres]]. The theorem was first stated by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] in the late 19th century. It was first proved in 1912 by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]].<ref>[http://dz-srv1.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub/digbib/loader?ht=VIEW&did=D28661 Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526145611/http://dz-srv1.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub/digbib/loader?ht=VIEW&did=D28661 |date=26 May 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==== Debye functions (1912) ====\nThe [[Debye functions]] are named in honor of [[Peter Debye]], who came across this function (with ''n'' = 3) in 1912 when he analytically computed the [[heat capacity]] of what is now called the [[Debye model]].\n\n==== Kramers\u2013Kronig relations (1927) ====\nThe [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relations]] are bidirectional [[mathematics|mathematical]] relations, connecting the [[real number|real]] and [[imaginary number|imaginary]] parts of any [[complex analysis|complex function]] that is [[analytic function|analytic]] in the [[upper half-plane]].

The curve is a [[cycloid]], and the time is equal to \u03c0 times the square root of the radius over the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]]. [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to discover the [[tautochrone|tautochronous property]] (or [[isochrone curve|isochronous property]]) of the cycloid.<ref>Knoebel, Arthur; Laubenbacher, Reinhard; Lodder, Jerry; Pengelley, David (2007). ''Mathematical Masterpieces: Further Chronicles by the Explorers''. (Springer), p. 169. \"The cycloid had already occupied the minds of great mathematicians and scientists such as Galileo, Torricelli, Mersenne, Roberval, Fermat, Descartes, Pascal, and others [18], yet none of them discovered its isochronous property.\"</ref> The [[tautochrone]] problem, the attempt to identify this curve, was solved by Christiaan Huygens in 1659. He proved geometrically in his ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'', originally published in 1673, that the curve was a [[cycloid]]. Huygens also proved that the time of descent is equal to the time a body takes to fall vertically the same distance as the diameter of the circle which generates the cycloid, multiplied by \u03c0\u20442. The [[tautochrone curve]] is the same as the [[brachistochrone curve]] for any given starting point. [[Johann Bernoulli]] posed the problem of the [[brachistochrone]] to the readers of ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'' in June, 1696. He published his solution in the journal in May of the following year, and noted that the solution is the same curve as Huygens's [[tautochrone curve]].<ref>Struik, Dirk Jan (1986).

In 1665, he reported the results by letter to the [[Royal Society of London]]. It is referred to as \"an odd kind of sympathy\" in the Society's minutes. This may be the first published observation of what is now called ''coupled oscillations''. In the 20th century, ''coupled oscillators'' took on great practical importance because of two discoveries: [[laser]]s, in which different atoms give off light waves that oscillate in unison, and [[superconductor]]s, in which pairs of electrons oscillate in synchrony, allowing electricity to flow with almost no resistance. ''Coupled oscillators'' are even more ubiquitous in nature, showing up, for example, in the synchronized flashing of fireflies and chirping of crickets, and in the pacemaker cells that regulate [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeats]].\n\n=== Medicine ===\n==== Foundations of modern (human) anatomy (1543) ====\n\n[[Image:Vesalius 164frc.png|right|thumb|200px|One of the large, detailed illustrations in [[Andreas Vesalius]]'s ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', 1543]]\n\nFlemish anatomist and physician [[Andreas Vesalius]] is often referred to as the founder of modern [[human anatomy]] for the publication of the seven-volume ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''On the Structure of the Human Body'') in 1543.\n\n==== Crystals in gouty tophi (1679) ====\nIn 1679, van Leeuwenhoek used a microscopes to assess tophaceous material and found that [[Tophus|gouty tophi]] consist of aggregates of needle-shaped crystals, and not globules of chalk as was previously believed.\n\n==== Boerhaave syndrome (1724) ====\n[[Boerhaave syndrome]] (also known as ''spontaneous esophageal perforation'' or ''esophageal rupture'') refers to an [[esophagus|esophageal]] rupture secondary to forceful [[vomiting]].

Because of the difficulty in describing individual bacteria and the importance of their discovery, the study of bacteria is generally that of the study of [[microbiology]].\n* [[Sperm cells]] (1677) \u2013 Sperm cells were first observed by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1677. The term \"[[sperm]]\" refers to the male [[reproductive]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. A uniflagellar [[sperm]] cell that is [[Motility|motile]] is referred to as a \"[[spermatozoon]]\", whereas a non-motile [[sperm cell]] is referred to as a \"spermatium\".\n* [[Spermatozoa]] (1677) \u2013 A [[spermatozoon]] or spermatozoon (''pl.'' spermatozoa), from the [[ancient Greek]] ''\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1'' (seed) and ''\u03b6\u03c9\u03bd'' (alive) and more commonly known as a sperm cell, is the [[ploidy|haploid]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] that is the male [[gamete]]. Sperm cells were first observed by a student of van Leeuwenhoek in 1677.

Rhizobium forms an [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing]] association with roots of [[legumes]] and ''Parasponia''.

He named it ''Bacillus radicicola'', which is now placed in ''[[Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology]]'' under the genus Rhizobium.\n\n==== Spirillum (first isolated sulfate-reducing bacteria) (1895) ====\n[[Martinus Beijerinck]] discovered the phenomenon of bacterial [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate reduction]], a form of [[anaerobic respiration]]. He learned that bacteria could use [[sulfate]] as a terminal [[electron acceptor]], instead of oxygen. He isolated and described ''[[Spirillum|Spirillum desulfuricans]]'' (now called ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/desulfovibrio |title=Genus ''Desulfovibrio'' |last1=Jean |first1=Euzeby |website= |publisher=[[List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]] |accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>), the first known [[sulfate-reducing bacterium]].\n\n==== Concept of virus (1898) ====\n[[File:Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms tobacco.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) symptoms on [[tobacco]].

They are aerobic, free-living soil [[Microorganism|microbes]] which play an important role in the [[nitrogen cycle]] in nature, binding atmospheric [[nitrogen]], which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of [[ammonium]] ions into the soil. Apart from being a [[model organism]], it is used by humans for the production of [[biofertilizer]]s, [[food additive]]s, and some [[biopolymer]]s. The first representative of the genus, ''Azotobacter chroococcum'', was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch [[microbiologist]] and botanist [[Martinus Beijerinck]].\n\n==== Enrichment culture (1904) ====\nBeijerinck is credited with developing the first [[enrichment culture]], a fundamental method of studying microbes from the environment.\n\n=== Physics ===\n==== 31 equal temperament (1661) ====\n\nDivision of the [[octave]] into 31 steps arose naturally out of Renaissance [[music theory]]; the lesser [[diesis]]  \u2013  the ratio of an octave to three major thirds, 128:125 or 41.06 cents  \u2013  was approximately a [[interval (music)|fifth]] of a tone and a third of a [[semitone]]. In 1666, [[Lemme Rossi]] first proposed an equal temperament of this order. Shortly thereafter, having discovered it independently, scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] wrote about it also. Since the standard system of [[musical tuning|tuning]] at that time was [[quarter-comma meantone]], in which the fifth is tuned to 5<sup>1/4</sup>, the appeal of this method was immediate, as the fifth of 31-et, at 696.77 cents, is only 0.19 cent wider than the fifth of quarter-comma meantone. Huygens not only realized this, he went farther and noted that 31-ET provides an excellent approximation of septimal, or [[limit (music)|7-limit]] harmony. In the twentieth century, physicist, music theorist and composer [[Adriaan Fokker]], after reading Huygens's work, led a revival of interest in this system of tuning which led to a number of compositions, particularly by Dutch composers. Fokker designed the [[Fokker organ]], a 31-tone equal-tempered organ, which was installed in [[Teylers Museum|Teyler's Museum]] in [[Haarlem]] in 1951.\n\n==== Foundations of classical mechanics (1673) ====\nThrough his fundamental contributions [[Christiaan Huygens]] helped shape and lay the foundations of [[classical mechanics]]. His works cover all the fields of [[mechanics]], from the invention of technical devices applicable to different machines to a purely rational knowledge of motion.<ref>Chareix, Fabien (2004). ''Huygens and Mechanics'' (ESA Science & Technology, University of Paris IV).</ref> Huygens published his results in a classic of the 17th-century mechanics, ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'' (1673), that is regarded as one of the three most important work done in mechanics in the 17th century, the other two being [[Galileo Galilei]]\u2019s ''Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences'' (1638) and [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica'' (1687). It is Huygens' major work on [[pendulum]]s and [[horology]]. As Domenico Bertoloni Meli (2006) notes, ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'' was \u201ca masterful combination of sophisticated mathematics and mechanics mixed with a range of practical applications culminating with a new clock aimed at resolving the vexing problem of longitude.\u201d<ref>Meli, Domenico Bertoloni (2006).

His argument that light consists of [[wave]]s now known as the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]], two centuries later became instrumental in the understanding of [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. The [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] experiments of [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] vindicated Huygens' s wave theory in 1801.<ref>Buchwald, Jed Z. (1989).

His argument that [[light]] consists of [[wave]]s, expounded in his ''Trait\u00e9 de la Lumi\u00e9re'' (''[[Treatise on light]]''), now known as the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]], which two centuries later became instrumental in the understanding of [[wave\u2013particle duality]].]]\nIn his ''[[Treatise on light]]'', Huygens showed how [[Snell's law]] of sines could be explained by, or derived from, the [[wave]] nature of [[light]], using the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]].\n\n==== Bernoulli's principle (1738) ====\n[[Bernoulli's principle]] was discovered by Dutch-Swiss mathematician and physicist [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and named after him. It states that for an [[inviscid flow]], an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.\n\n==== Brownian motion (1785) ====\nIn 1785, Ingenhousz described the irregular movement of [[coal dust]] on the surface of alcohol and therefore has a claim as discoverer of what came to be known as [[Brownian motion]].\n\n==== Buys Ballot's law (1857) ====\nThe law takes its name from Dutch meteorologist [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot]], who published it in the ''Comptes Rendus'', in November 1857. While [[William Ferrel]] first theorized this in 1856, Buys Ballot was the first to provide an [[empirical validation]]. The law states that in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], if a person stands with his back to the wind, the low pressure area will be on his left, because wind travels counterclockwise around low pressure zones in that [[Hemisphere of the Earth|hemisphere]]. this is approximately true in the higher latitudes and is reversed in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].\n\n==== Foundations of molecular physics (1873) ====\nSpearheaded by [[Ernst Mach|Mach]] and [[Wilhelm Ostwald|Ostwald]], a strong philosophical current that denied the existence of [[molecules]] arose towards the end of the 19th century. The molecular existence was considered unproven and the molecular hypothesis unnecessary. At the time Van der Waals' thesis was written (1873), the [[molecular structure]] of [[fluids]] had not been accepted by most physicists, and [[liquid]] and [[vapor]] were often considered as chemically distinct. But [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals|Van der Waals]]'s work affirmed the reality of molecules and allowed an assessment of their size and [[Van der Waals forces|attractive strength]].<ref>Johannes van der Waals: \"...It will be perfectly clear that in all my studies I was quite convinced of the real existence of [[molecules]], that I never regarded them as a figment of my imagination, nor even as mere [[centres of force]] effects. I considered them to be the actual bodies, thus what we term \"body\" in daily speech ought better to be called \"pseudo body\". It is an aggregate of bodies and empty space. We do not know the nature of a molecule consisting of a single chemical atom. It would be premature to seek to answer this question but to admit this ignorance in no way impairs the belief in its real existence. When I began my studies I had the feeling that I was almost alone in holding that view. And when, as occurred already in my 1873 treatise, I determined their number in one gram-mol, their size and the nature of their action, I was strengthened in my opinion, yet still there often arose within me the question whether in the final analysis a molecule is a figment of the imagination and the entire molecular theory too. And now I do not think it any exaggeration to state that the real existence of molecules is universally assumed by physicists. Many of those who opposed it most have ultimately been won over, and my theory may have been a contributory factor. And precisely this, I feel, is a step forward. Anyone acquainted with the writings of Boltzmann and Willard Gibbs will admit that physicists carrying great authority believe that the complex phenomena of the heat theory can only be interpreted in this way. It is a great pleasure for me that an increasing number of younger physicists find the inspiration for their work in studies and contemplations of the molecular theory...\" (''The equation of state for gases and liquids'', Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1910)</ref> By comparing [[Van der Waals equation of state|his equation of state]] with experimental data, Van der Waals was able to obtain estimates for the actual size of molecules and the strength of [[Van der Waals forces|their mutual attraction]].<ref>Sengers, Johanna Levelt (2002), p. 16</ref> The effect of Van der Waals's work on [[molecular science]] in the 20th century was direct and fundamental, as is well recognized and documented, due in large part to books by [[John Rowlinson]] (1988), and by Kipnis and Yavelov (1996). By [[Van der Waals constants (data page)|introducing parameters]] characterizing molecular size and attraction in constructing his [[equation of state]], Van der Waals set the tone for [[molecular physics]] ([[molecular dynamics]] in particular) of the 20th century. That molecular aspects such as size, shape, attraction, and [[intermolecular force|multipolar interactions]] should form the basis for mathematical formulations of the thermodynamic and transport properties of [[fluids]] is presently considered an axiom.<ref>Sengers, Johanna Levelt (2002), p. 255\u201356</ref>\n\n==== Van der Waals equation of state (1873) ====\nIn 1873, [[J. D. van der Waals]] introduced the [[Van der Waals equation of state|first equation of state]] derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent [[molecules]].<ref>Van der Waals, J. D. (1873). ''On the Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States'' (Doctoral dissertation, Universiteit Leiden).</ref> The [[Van der Waals equation]] is generally regarded as the first somewhat realistic [[equation of state]] (beyond the ideal gas law). Van der Waals noted the [[ideal gas|non-ideality]] of [[gases]] and attributed it to the existence of [[intermolecular interaction|molecular]] or atomic interactions. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the [[Redlich-Kwong equation of state]] (1949) and the Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong. While the Van der Waals equation is definitely superior to the [[ideal gas law]] and does predict the formation of a [[liquid phase]], the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. Except at higher pressures, the [[real gas]]es do not obey [[Van der Waals equation]] in all ranges of pressures and temperatures. Despite its limitations, the equation has historical importance, because it was the first attempt to model the behaviour of [[real gas]]es.\n\n==== Van der Waals forces (1873) ====\n[[File:Gecko Leaftail 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Van der Waals force]] between [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s and surfaces is a part of everyday life in many different ways. [[Gecko]]s can stick to walls and ceilings because of [[Van der Waals force]]s.]]\n\nThe [[van der Waals force]]s are named after the scientist who first described them in 1873. [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]] noted the non-ideality of gases and attributed it to the existence of molecular or atomic interactions. They are forces that develop between the atoms inside molecules and keep them together.<ref>Parsegian, V. Adrian (2005). ''Van der Waals Forces: A Handbook for Biologists, Chemists, Engineers, and Physicists'', p. 2</ref> The Van der Waals forces between molecules, much weaker than [[chemical bonds]] but present universally, play a fundamental role in fields as diverse as [[supramolecular chemistry]], [[structural biology]], [[polymer science]], [[nanotechnology]], [[surface science]], and [[condensed matter physics]]. Elucidation of the nature of the Van der Waals forces between molecules has remained a scientific effort from Van der Waals's days to the present.\n\n==== Van der Waals radius (1873) ====\nThe [[Van der Waals radius]], ''r''{{sub|w}}, of an [[atom]] is the radius of an imaginary hard [[sphere]] which can be used to model the atom for many purposes. It is named after [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]], winner of the 1910 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], as he was the first to recognise that atoms were not simply [[Point (geometry)|points]] and to demonstrate the physical consequences of their size through the [[Van der Waals equation|van der Waals equation of state]].\n\n==== Law of corresponding states (1880) ====\nThe [[Theorem of corresponding states|law of corresponding states]] was first suggested and formulated by van der Waals in 1880. This showed that the van der Waals equation of state can be expressed as a simple function of the critical pressure, critical volume and critical temperature. This general form is applicable to all substances. The compound-specific constants a and b in the original equation are replaced by universal (compound-independent) quantities. It was this law that served as a guide during experiments which ultimately led to the [[liquefaction]] of [[hydrogen]] by [[James Dewar]] in 1898 and of [[helium]] by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] in 1908.\n\n==== Lorentz ether theory (1892) ====\n[[Lorentz ether theory]] has its roots in [[Hendrik Lorentz]]'s \"theory of electrons\", which was the final point in the development of the classical [[aether (classical element)|aether]] theories at the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century. Lorentz's initial theory created in 1892 and 1895 was based on a completely motionless aether. Many aspects of Lorentz's theory were incorporated into [[special relativity]] with the works of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]].\n\n==== Lorentz force law (1892) ====\n[[File:Lorentz force particle.svg|180px|thumb|[[Lorentz force]] '''F''' on a [[charged particle]] (of [[electric charge|charge]] ''q'') in motion (instantaneous velocity '''v''').

It is also called the ''radiation reaction force'' or the ''self force''.\n\n==== Lorentz transformation (1895) ====\nIn physics, the [[Lorentz transformation]] (or [[Lorentz transformations]]) is named after the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]]. It was the result of attempts by Lorentz and others to explain how the speed of [[light]] was observed to be independent of the [[frame of reference|reference frame]], and to understand the symmetries of the laws of [[electromagnetism]]. The Lorentz transformation is in accordance with [[special relativity]], but was derived before special relativity. Early approximations of the transformation were published by Lorentz in 1895. In 1905, [[Poincar\u00e9]] was the first to recognize that the transformation has the properties of a [[group (mathematics)|mathematical group]], and named it after Lorentz.\n\n==== Lorentz contraction (1895) ====\nIn physics, [[length contraction]] (more formally called [[Lorentz contraction]] or [[Lorentz\u2013FitzGerald contraction]] after [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[George FitzGerald]]) is the phenomenon of a decrease in length measured by the observer, of an object which is traveling at any non-zero velocity relative to the observer. This contraction is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the [[speed of light]].\n\n==== Lorentz factor (1895) ====\nThe [[Lorentz factor]] or ''Lorentz term'' is the factor by which time, length, and [[relativistic mass]] change for an object while that object is moving. It is an expression which appears in several equations in [[special relativity]], and it arises from deriving the [[Lorentz transformation]]s. The name originates from its earlier appearance in [[Lorentz ether theory|Lorentzian electrodynamics]] \u2013 named after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]].<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/html/oneuniverse/motion_knowledge_concept_12.html One universe], by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], Charles Tsun-Chu Liu, and Robert Irion.</ref>\n\n==== Zeeman effect (1896) ====\n[[File:EinsteinZeemanEhrenfest.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Discoverer of the [[Zeeman effect]], [[Pieter Zeeman]] with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Paul Ehrenfest]] in his laboratory in Amsterdam (circa 1920).]]\nThe [[Zeeman effect]], named after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicist [[Pieter Zeeman]], is the effect of splitting a [[spectral line]] into several components in the presence of a static [[magnetic field]]. It is analogous to the [[Stark effect]], the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an [[electric field]]. Also similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different components have, in general, different intensities, with some being entirely forbidden (in the [[dipole]] approximation), as governed by the [[selection rule]]s.\n\nSince the distance between the Zeeman sub-levels is a function of the magnetic field, this effect can be used to measure the magnetic field, e.g. that of the [[Sun]] and other [[star]]s or in laboratory [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].\nThe Zeeman effect is very important in applications such as [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy, [[electron spin resonance]] spectroscopy, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]]. It may also be utilized to improve accuracy in [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]].\n\nA theory about the [[magnetic sense]] of birds assumes that a protein in the retina is changed due to the Zeeman effect.<ref>[http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/9/583.full The magnetic compass mechanisms of birds and rodents are based on different physical principles].

''Superconductivity: Fundamentals and Applications''</ref>\n\n==== Einstein\u2013de Haas effect (1910s) ====\nThe [[Einstein\u2013de Haas effect]] or the ''Richardson effect'' (after [[Owen Willans Richardson]]), is a physical phenomenon delineated by [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Wander Johannes de Haas]] in the mid 1910s, that exposes a relationship between [[magnetism]], [[angular momentum]], and the [[Electron magnetic moment|spin]] of elementary particles.\n\n==== Debye model (1912) ====\nIn [[thermodynamics]] and [[solid state physics]], the [[Debye model]] is a method developed by [[Peter Debye]] in 1912 for estimating the [[phonon]] contribution to the [[specific heat]] (heat capacity) in a [[solid]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Debye |title=Zur Theorie der spezifischen Waerme |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |location=Leipzig |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=789\u2013839 |year=1912 |doi= 10.1002/andp.19123441404 |bibcode=1912AnP...344..789D |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1424256/files/article.pdf }}</ref> It treats the [[oscillation|vibrations]] of the [[Crystal structure#Classification|atomic lattice]] (heat) as [[phonon]]s in a box, in contrast to the [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]], which treats the solid as many individual, non-interacting [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s. The Debye model correctly predicts the low temperature dependence of the heat capacity.\n\n==== De Sitter precession (1916) ====\nThe [[geodetic effect]] (also known as geodetic precession, [[de Sitter precession]] or [[De Sitter precession|de Sitter effect]]) represents the effect of the curvature of [[spacetime]], predicted by [[general relativity]], on a vector carried along with an orbiting body. The geodetic effect was first predicted by [[Willem de Sitter]] in 1916, who provided relativistic corrections to the Earth\u2013Moon system's motion.\n\n==== De Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space (1920s) ====\nIn mathematics and physics, a [[de Sitter space]] is the analog in [[Minkowski space]], or spacetime, of a sphere in ordinary, [[Euclidean space]]. The ''n''-dimensional de Sitter space, denoted dS<sub>''n''</sub>, is the [[Lorentzian manifold]] analog of an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] (with its canonical [[Riemannian metric]]); it is maximally [[symmetric]], has constant positive [[scalar curvature|curvature]], and is [[simply connected]] for ''n'' at least 3. The de Sitter space, as well as the [[anti-de Sitter space]] is named after [[Willem de Sitter]] (1872\u20131934), professor of astronomy at [[Leiden University]] and director of the [[Leiden Observatory]]. Willem de Sitter and [[Albert Einstein]] worked in the 1920s in [[Leiden]] closely together on the spacetime structure of our universe. De Sitter space was discovered by [[Willem de Sitter]], and, at the same time, independently by [[Tullio Levi-Civita]].\n\n==== Van der Pol oscillator (1920) ====\nIn [[dynamical system]]s, a [[Van der Pol oscillator]] is a non-conservative [[oscillator]] with non-linear [[damping]]. It was originally proposed by Dutch physicist [[Balthasar van der Pol]] while he was working at Philips in 1920. Van der Pol studied a [[differential equation]] that describes the circuit of a [[vacuum tube]]. It has been used to model other phenomenon such as human [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeats]] by colleague Jan van der Mark.\n\n==== Kramers' opacity law (1923) ====\n[[Kramers' opacity law]] describes the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of a medium in terms of the ambient [[density]] and [[temperature]], assuming that the opacity is dominated by [[ionization|bound-free absorption]] (the absorption of light during ionization of a bound [[electron]]) or [[free-free absorption]] (the absorption of light when scattering a free ion, also called [[bremsstrahlung]]).<ref>Phillips (1999), p. 92.</ref> It is often used to model [[radiative transfer]], particularly in [[stellar atmosphere]]s.<ref>Carroll (1996), p. 274\u2013276.</ref> The relation is named after the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[physicist]] [[Hendrik Kramers]], who first derived the form in 1923.<ref name=\"Carroll274\">Carroll (1996), p. 274.</ref>\n\n==== Electron spin (1925) ====\nIn 1925, Dutch physicists [[George Eugene Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] co-discovered the concept of [[electron spin]], which posits an intrinsic [[angular momentum]] for all electrons.\n\n==== Solidification of helium (1926) ====\nIn 1926, Onnes' student, Dutch physicist [[Willem Hendrik Keesom]], invented a method\nto freeze [[liquid helium]] and was the first person who was able to solidify the noble gas.\n\n==== Ehrenfest theorem (1927) ====\nThe [[Ehrenfest theorem]], named after the Austrian-born [[Dutch Jew|Dutch-Jew]] theoretical physicist [[Paul Ehrenfest]] at [[Leiden University]].\n\n==== De Haas\u2013van Alphen effect (1930) ====\nThe [[de Haas\u2013van Alphen effect]], often abbreviated to dHvA, is a [[quantum mechanical]] effect in which the [[magnetic moment]] of a pure metal [[crystal]] oscillates as the intensity of an applied [[magnetic field]] B is increased. It was discovered in 1930 by [[Wander Johannes de Haas]] and his student P. M. van Alphen.\n\n==== Shubnikov\u2013de Haas effect (1930) ====\nThe [[Shubnikov\u2013de Haas effect]] (ShdH) is named after Dutch physicist [[Wander Johannes de Haas]] and Russian physicist [[Lev Shubnikov]].\n\n==== Kramers degeneracy theorem (1930) ====\nIn quantum mechanics, the [[Kramers theorem|Kramers degeneracy theorem]] states that for every energy eigenstate of a [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetric]] system with half-integer total spin, there is at least one more eigenstate with the same energy. It was first discovered in 1930 by [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|H. A. Kramers]]<ref>Kramers, H. A., Proc. Amsterdam Acad. 33, 959 (1930)</ref> as a consequence of the [[Breit equation]].\n\n==== Minnaert resonance frequency (1933) ====\nIn 1933, [[Marcel Minnaert]] published a solution for the [[Acoustics|acoustic]] [[resonance frequency]] of a single [[Liquid bubble|bubble]] in [[water]], the so-called [[Minnaert resonance]]. The [[Minnaert resonance]] or [[Minnaert frequency]]<ref>{{Citation |last=Minnaert |first=M. |authorlink=Marcel Minnaert |year=1933 |title=On musical air-bubbles and the sound of running water |journal=Philosophical Magazine |volume=16 |issue=104 |pages=235\u201348 |doi=10.1080/14786443309462277}}</ref> is the [[acoustic resonance|acoustic]] [[resonance]] frequency of a single bubble in an infinite domain of water (neglecting the effects of [[surface tension]] and [[Viscosity|viscous]] [[attenuation]]).\n\n==== Casimir effect (1948) ====\nIn quantum field theory, the [[Casimir effect]] and the [[Casimir\u2013Polder force]] are physical forces arising from a quantized field. Dutch physicists [[Hendrik Casimir]] and [[Dirk Polder]] at Philips Research Labs proposed the existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947. After a conversation with [[Niels Bohr]] who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948; the former is called the Casimir\u2013Polder force while the latter is the Casimir effect in the narrow sense.\n\n==== Tellegen's theorem (1952) ====\n[[Tellegen's theorem]] is one of the most powerful theorems in [[network theory]]. Most of the energy distribution theorems and extremum principles in network theory can be derived from it. It was published in 1952 by [[Bernard Tellegen]]. Fundamentally, Tellegen's theorem gives a simple relation between magnitudes that satisfy [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's laws]] of [[electrical circuit theory]].\n\n==== Stochastic cooling (1970s) ====\nIn the early 1970s [[Simon van der Meer]], a Dutch particle physicist at [[CERN]], discovered this technique to concentrate proton and anti-proton beams, leading to the discovery of the [[W particle|W]] and [[Z particle]]s. He won the 1984 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] together with [[Carlo Rubbia]].\n\n==== Renormalization of gauge theories (1971) ====\nIn 1971, [[Gerardus 't Hooft]], who was completing his PhD under the supervision of Dutch theoretical physicist [[Martinus Veltman]], [[renormalization|renormalized]] [[Yang\u2013Mills theory]]. They showed that if the symmetries of Yang\u2013Mills theory were to be realized in the [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] mode, referred to as the Higgs mechanism, then Yang\u2013Mills theory can be renormalized.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=G.

In 1993, Dutch theoretical physicist [[Gerard 't Hooft]] proposed what is now known as the [[holographic principle]].
