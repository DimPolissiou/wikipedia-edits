He came to the fore in the [[Turkish literature]] of the Republican era with his psychological works such as ''Dokuzuncu Hariciye Ko\u011fu\u015fu'' (Ninth External Ward). He reflected his life and his changes to his works. He wrote many novels under the pseudonym ''Server Bedi''. He created the type ''Cing\u00f6z Recai'' inspired by [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]] of the French writer [[Maurice Leblanc]]. He also worked as a journalist at various institutions and published several magazines such as K\u00fclt\u00fcr Haftas\u0131 with his brother \u0130lhami Safa.\n\nThe poet [[Tevfik Fikret]] named him when he was born. After he lost his father at a young age, he lived under difficult conditions with his mother and brother. Bone tuberculosis appeared on the right arm. He processed his psychology in those years in his autobiographical novel, Ninth External Ward. He gave his first literary products during his education in [[Vefa High School]]. He worked as a teacher for a short time. The stories he published under the title ''Stories of the Century'' drew attention and received encouraging reactions. He entered pen quarrels with prominent literary writers of the period. He experienced various changes by exhibiting [[Positivism|positivist]], [[materialist]], [[mystical]], [[nationalist]], [[conservative]], [[anti-communist]] and [[corporatist]] attitudes. With his knowledge of [[French language|French]], he closely followed Western culture and innovations. In his early days, he made translations from names such as [[Maupassant]] and [[Rousseau]]. He always chose [[Istanbul]] as the venue for his later works and never gave up the synthesis and analysis of the East and the West. He published articles with critical style in newspapers such as [[Milliyet]]. His good relationships with [[N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet]] and [[Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek]] turned into pen fights over time. At first, he became closer to the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]], then to the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, 1946)|Democratic Party]].\n\nHe continued his literary life, which he started at a young age, until his death. He was mainly [[nationalist]] and [[conservative]]. [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]] recommended his two books for secondary school students. His works were also adapted to the cinema and series in various periods.\n\n== Life ==\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Peyami Safa's childhood photo for a magazine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A childhood photo of Peyami Safa (1913)]]\nPeyami Safa was born on April 2, 1889 in Gedikpa\u015fa and named after Tevfik Fikret, one of the poets of [[Servet-i F\u00fcn\u00fbn]].

During his primary education, bone tuberculosis appeared in his right arm. Due to his illness, he could not attend school and found himself among doctors, patients and caregivers at a young age. He influenced the effect of this disease in his work, [[Dokuzuncu Hariciye Ko\u011fu\u015fu]]. <ref name=\":Bilkent\">{{Cite web| last1 = Aksoy | first1 = S\u00fcreyya Elif |title = Peyami Safa Romanlar\u0131nda Modernle\u015fme ve Mekan | url = http://www.thesis.bilkent.edu.tr/0003885.pdf | publisher = [[Bilkent University]] | date = 2016 }}</ref>\n\nHe started his high school education in [[Vefa High School]] in [[Fatih]] in [[1910]]. During these years, he was a classmate with [[Ekrem Hakk\u0131 Ayverdi]] and [[Elif Naci]]. Also [[Hasan \u00c2li Y\u00fccel]] and [[Yusuf Ziya Orta\u00e7]] were among their high school friends. He gave his first literary discussions and products in those years. He wrote his first story essay ''Piano Teaching'' and his first novel essay ''Eski Dost'' in high school.

In this newspaper, he drew attention with the stories he published under the heading \"Stories of the Century\". [8] He also made his first pen fight against [[Cenap \u015eahabettin]]'s adaptation play (1919). When he received a degree in the story contest organized by Alemdar newspaper, he was encouraged to write by the leading writers of the period. After ''Yirminci Y\u00fczy\u0131l'' was closed, they lasted his profession in journalism in places such as [[Terc\u00fcman-\u0131 Hakikat]] and [[Tasvir-i Efkar|Tasvir-i Efk\u00e2r]] (1922) after the declaration of the Republic. In addition, he published his first novel, ''[[S\u00f6zde K\u0131zlar]]'' (So-called Girls), for his livelihood. By [[1924]], He published his several works including ''Mah\u015fer'', ''Bir Gece'' (One Evening), ''S\u00fcng\u00fclerin G\u00f6lgesinde'' (In the Shadow of the Bayonets) and ''Istanbul Hikayeleri'' (the Stories of Istanbul). [9] In [[1925]], he published a short-lived newspaper called B\u00fcy\u00fck Yol with [[Halil L\u00fctf\u00fc D\u00f6rd\u00fcnc\u00fc]]. Also in these years, he wrote in [[Cumhuriyet]] newspaper with the signature of \"Server Bedi\" and \"Peyami Safa\". He went on his relationship with the newspaper as a columnist and literature manager (1928-1940). His article titled \"New Literary Circles\" published in Hilal-i Ahmer magazine led to a pencil fight with [[Ahmet Ha\u015fim]] (1928). [10]\n\nIn the early years, under the influence of [[Abdullah Cevdet]], he wrote articles in [[Ijtihad]] magazine with positivist and materialist thoughts. In particular, he participated in the discussion between Abdullah Cevdet and Celal Nuri Ileri [11]. During the period of Armistice, he generally gave both a westernist and a nationalist appearance. [5] He approached [[Turkish Letter Revolution]], which took place during the time of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], anxiously considering that it would cause cultural disconnections between generations, but in the following periods he became one of the complementary of this revolution and participated in language congresses. [12]\n\n=== Relations with Naz\u0131m Hikmet ===\n\n[[File:Nazim Hikmet (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet]]\n\nWhen [[N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet]] arrived in [[Turkey]] to benefit from the amnesty law, Safa published the poem \"Volcano\", which belongs to Naz\u0131m for the forgiveness of him in [[Cumhuriyet]]. The next day, Cumhuriyet made a statement that the signature under the poem did not reflect its own views and missions. After this announcement, Safa left the newspaper and started writing in the journal [[Resimli Ay]], published by [[Sabiha Sertel]] and [[Zekeriya Sertel]]. [6] Apart from them, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet, [[Sabahattin Ali]], [[Vala Nureddin|V\u00e2l\u00e2 Nureddin]] and [[Cevat \u015eakir Kabaa\u011fa\u00e7l\u0131]] were among the most well-known authors of this magazine. [13] Peyami Safa and N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet worked together in the journal ''Hareket''in the following periods. The friendship between the two names continued with Peyami Safa's dedication to ''Dokuzuncu Hariciye Ko\u011fu\u015fu'', to N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet. [2] N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet, on the other hand, used the following expressions about the novel in Resimli Ay (the Illustrated Moon) by referring to [[Re\u015fat Nuri G\u00fcntekin]]'s [[\u00c7al\u0131ku\u015fu]]:\n\n{{Quote|I have read this last novel of Peyami three times. I can read and read thirty times more ... It is not possible for those who cry to ''\u00c7al\u0131ku\u015fu'' to understand ''Dokuzuncu Hariciye Ko\u011fu\u015fu''. It would be sold by ten thousand, one hundred thousand, one million; if they knew how to read and write the self and pure masses of people who heard the anguish, torment and joy with great enthusiasm. [14]}}\n\nSafa has published an article titled ''Var\u0131z Diyen Nesil'' (The Generation who says We Exist) in the first issue of the journal ''Hareket''. When this article reflects the views of young literary writers and the new generation mentioned, this was criticized by Yakup Kadri Karaosmano\u011flu in [[Milliyet]], the famous pencil fight called ''Saman Ekme\u011fi Kavgas\u0131'' (The Fight of Straw Bread) started in the history of Turkish press. [15] Safa was accused of being [[Bolshevik]] for participating in the discussions titled ''Putlar\u0131 Y\u0131k\u0131yoruz''(We Are Destroying the Idols) [16], which started in Resimli Ay, together with N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet and writing articles in the left-wing newspaper [[Tan]] [17]. But he always denied these allegations. [6] The friendship of the two continued after the closing of Resimli Ay. In time, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet's desire to bring him to [[communism]] and as a result of his efforts to discourage N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet from this ideology, this friendship turned into a great hostility. [18] N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet accused Peyami Safa in his article titled ''Coffee and Casino Intellectuals'' written ,n Tan under the pseudonym Orhan Selim. Peyami Safa also responded to N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet under the series titled ''Biraz Ayd\u0131nl\u0131k'' in the magazine ''Hafta'', which he published with his brother. [19] From this point on, Peyami Safa adopted an anti-communist worldview until the end of his life. [6] In the following process, Peyami Safa's works with the signature of [[Server Bedi]] and [[Cing\u00f6z Recai]] typing became the main subject of the discussions between the two.

In these novels, he stressed on the west-east conflict in the Turkish society during the early years of the [[Turkish Republic]]. His novel ''Dokuzuncu Hariciye Ko\u011fu\u015fu'' gained much interest. In 1931, he wrote his only historical novel about ''Attila the Hun''. Besides these novels, he wrote many serial stories and novels in newspapers, among them in ''[[Cumhuriyet]]'' and ''[[Milliyet]]'', under the pseudonym \"Server Bedii\".

He reflected his life and his changes to his works. He wrote many novels under the pseudonym ''Server Bedi''. He created the type ''Cing\u00f6z Recai'' inspired by [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]] of the French writer [[Maurice Leblanc]]. He also worked as a journalist at various institutions and published several magazines such as K\u00fclt\u00fcr Haftas\u0131 with his brother \u0130lhami Safa.\n\nThe poet [[Tevfik Fikret]] named him when he was born.

He worked as a teacher for a short time. The stories he published under the title ''Stories of the Century'' drew attention and received encouraging reactions. He entered pen quarrels with prominent literary writers of the period. He experienced various changes by exhibiting [[Positivism|positivist]], [[materialist]], [[mystical]], [[nationalist]], [[conservative]], [[anti-communist]] and [[corporatist]] attitudes. With his knowledge of [[French language|French]], he closely followed Western culture and innovations. In his early days, he made translations from names such as [[Maupassant]] and [[Rousseau]]. He always chose [[Istanbul]] as the venue for his later works and never gave up the synthesis and analysis of the East and the West. He published articles with critical style in newspapers such as [[Milliyet]]. His good relationships with [[N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet]] and [[Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek]] turned into pen fights over time. At first, he became closer to the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]], then to the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, 1946)|Democratic Party]].\n\nHe continued his literary life, which he started at a young age, until his death. He was mainly [[nationalist]] and [[conservative]]. [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]] recommended his two books for secondary school students. His works were also adapted to the cinema and series in various periods.\n\n== Life ==\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Peyami Safa's childhood photo for a magazine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A childhood photo of Peyami Safa (1913)]]\nPeyami Safa was born on April 2, 1889 in Gedikpa\u015fa and named after Tevfik Fikret, one of the poets of [[Servet-i F\u00fcn\u00fbn]].

During his primary education, bone tuberculosis appeared in his right arm. Due to his illness, he could not attend school and found himself among doctors, patients and caregivers at a young age.

In this newspaper, he drew attention with the stories he published under the heading \"Stories of the Century\". [8] He also made his first pen fight against [[Cenap \u015eahabettin]]'s adaptation play (1919). When he received a degree in the story contest organized by Alemdar newspaper, he was encouraged to write by the leading writers of the period. After ''Yirminci Y\u00fczy\u0131l'' was closed, they lasted his profession in journalism in places such as [[Terc\u00fcman-\u0131 Hakikat]] and [[Tasvir-i Efkar|Tasvir-i Efk\u00e2r]] (1922) after the declaration of the Republic. In addition, he published his first novel, ''[[S\u00f6zde K\u0131zlar]]'' (So-called Girls), for his livelihood. By [[1924]], He published his several works including ''Mah\u015fer'', ''Bir Gece'' (One Evening), ''S\u00fcng\u00fclerin G\u00f6lgesinde'' (In the Shadow of the Bayonets) and ''Istanbul Hikayeleri'' (the Stories of Istanbul). [9] In [[1925]], he published a short-lived newspaper called B\u00fcy\u00fck Yol with [[Halil L\u00fctf\u00fc D\u00f6rd\u00fcnc\u00fc]]. Also in these years, he wrote in [[Cumhuriyet]] newspaper with the signature of \"Server Bedi\" and \"Peyami Safa\". He went on his relationship with the newspaper as a columnist and literature manager (1928-1940). His article titled \"New Literary Circles\" published in Hilal-i Ahmer magazine led to a pencil fight with [[Ahmet Ha\u015fim]] (1928). [10]\n\nIn the early years, under the influence of [[Abdullah Cevdet]], he wrote articles in [[Ijtihad]] magazine with positivist and materialist thoughts. In particular, he participated in the discussion between Abdullah Cevdet and Celal Nuri Ileri [11]. During the period of Armistice, he generally gave both a westernist and a nationalist appearance. [5] He approached [[Turkish Letter Revolution]], which took place during the time of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], anxiously considering that it would cause cultural disconnections between generations, but in the following periods he became one of the complementary of this revolution and participated in language congresses. [12]\n\n=== Relations with Naz\u0131m Hikmet ===\n\n[[File:Nazim Hikmet (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet]]\n\nWhen [[N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet]] arrived in [[Turkey]] to benefit from the amnesty law, Safa published the poem \"Volcano\", which belongs to Naz\u0131m for the forgiveness of him in [[Cumhuriyet]]. The next day, Cumhuriyet made a statement that the signature under the poem did not reflect its own views and missions. After this announcement, Safa left the newspaper and started writing in the journal [[Resimli Ay]], published by [[Sabiha Sertel]] and [[Zekeriya Sertel]]. [6] Apart from them, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet, [[Sabahattin Ali]], [[Vala Nureddin|V\u00e2l\u00e2 Nureddin]] and [[Cevat \u015eakir Kabaa\u011fa\u00e7l\u0131]] were among the most well-known authors of this magazine. [13] Peyami Safa and N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet worked together in the journal ''Hareket''in the following periods. The friendship between the two names continued with Peyami Safa's dedication to ''Dokuzuncu Hariciye Ko\u011fu\u015fu'', to N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet. [2] N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet, on the other hand, used the following expressions about the novel in Resimli Ay (the Illustrated Moon) by referring to [[Re\u015fat Nuri G\u00fcntekin]]'s [[\u00c7al\u0131ku\u015fu]]:\n\n{{Quote|I have read this last novel of Peyami three times.

It would be sold by ten thousand, one hundred thousand, one million; if they knew how to read and write the self and pure masses of people who heard the anguish, torment and joy with great enthusiasm. [14]}}\n\nSafa has published an article titled ''Var\u0131z Diyen Nesil'' (The Generation who says We Exist) in the first issue of the journal ''Hareket''. When this article reflects the views of young literary writers and the new generation mentioned, this was criticized by Yakup Kadri Karaosmano\u011flu in [[Milliyet]], the famous pencil fight called ''Saman Ekme\u011fi Kavgas\u0131'' (The Fight of Straw Bread) started in the history of Turkish press. [15] Safa was accused of being [[Bolshevik]] for participating in the discussions titled ''Putlar\u0131 Y\u0131k\u0131yoruz''(We Are Destroying the Idols) [16], which started in Resimli Ay, together with N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet and writing articles in the left-wing newspaper [[Tan]] [17]. But he always denied these allegations. [6] The friendship of the two continued after the closing of Resimli Ay. In time, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet's desire to bring him to [[communism]] and as a result of his efforts to discourage N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet from this ideology, this friendship turned into a great hostility. [18] N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet accused Peyami Safa in his article titled ''Coffee and Casino Intellectuals'' written ,n Tan under the pseudonym Orhan Selim. Peyami Safa also responded to N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet under the series titled ''Biraz Ayd\u0131nl\u0131k'' in the magazine ''Hafta'', which he published with his brother. [19] From this point on, Peyami Safa adopted an anti-communist worldview until the end of his life. [6] In the following process, Peyami Safa's works with the signature of [[Server Bedi]] and [[Cing\u00f6z Recai]] typing became the main subject of the discussions between the two.

His novel ''Dokuzuncu Hariciye Ko\u011fu\u015fu'' gained much interest. In 1931, he wrote his only historical novel about ''Attila the Hun''. Besides these novels, he wrote many serial stories and novels in newspapers, among them in ''[[Cumhuriyet]]'' and ''[[Milliyet]]'', under the pseudonym \"Server Bedii\".

It was also the Falcon's last championship win until [[1993 Australian Touring Car Championship|1993]].\n\n1984 saw the first ever ATCC race win by a [[turbocharged]] car when [[George Fury]] won the 6th round at a wet [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside Raceway]] just north of [[Brisbane]] driving a [[Datsun Bluebird 910|Nissan Bluebird Turbo]].\n\n[[Peter Brock]], driving a [[Marlboro Holden Dealer Team]] entered [[Holden VH Commodore|Holden Commodore]], was the only driver to win more than once, with victories in the opening rounds at [[Sandown Raceway|Sandown]] and [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]]. Johnson's only win in the series was at the 4th round at [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]], though he never finished lower than 3rd in any other round. [[Allan Grice]] won the last round at [[Adelaide International Raceway|Adelaide]] (his last ever ATCC race win), and thus the distinction of winning the last ATCC race run under Group C rules. Defending champion [[Allan Moffat]] only won one round of the series, at [[Barbagallo Raceway|Wanneroo Park]], and suffered a crash at Surfers Paradise in which he not only wrote off his [[Mazda RX-7]], but also broke bones in his right hand and suffered a fractured sternum, forcing him out of the series (in fact, Moffat would not appear in another ATCC race until round 4 of the [[1988 Australian Touring Car Championship|1988 series]] at Wanneroo). The only other winner was former champion [[Bob Morris (racing driver)|Bob Morris]] who introduced some flavour to the series when he made a comeback to the sport in 1984, winning Round 5 at [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] in an RX-7 fitted with a standard gearbox after the team's only race unit was broken in practice. Holden Commodore driver Warren Cullen finished 4th in the championship and was the only driver other than Dick Johnson to finish every round of the series.\n\nUnfortunately for the final ATCC run under the local Group C rules, with the exception of Dick Johnson, [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] contesting his first ATCC in his [[JPS Team BMW|JPS Team]] [[BMW E24|BMW 635 CSi]], Warren Cullen's two car Commodore team backed by [[K-Mart]] with new teammate Andrew Harris in his [[1982 James Hardie 1000|1982]] and 1983 Bathurst winning ex-HDT Commodore, and [[1983 Australian Endurance Championship|1983 Australian Endurance Champion]] [[Peter McLeod]] in his Slick 50 Mazda RX-7, the series was devoid of many of its big name drivers from mid-season. Peter Brock missed both [[Queensland]] rounds due to his commitment to race a [[Porsche 956]] with his [[Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] winning co-driver [[Larry Perkins]] at the [[1984 1000 km of Silverstone|1000 km of Silverstone]] and [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] races and was substituted in both races by teammate [[John Harvey (racing driver)|John Harvey]] having his first ATCC drive since [[1979 Australian Touring Car Championship|1979]]. After the [[Roadways Racing]] team lost their STP sponsorship (though still running a single car for Steve Harrington), Allan Grice struggled to find enough sponsorship other than SAAS Wheels to run his rented Roadways Commodore for the entire series and missed most of the mid-season rounds, during which time he drove the ex-[[Bob Jane]] DeKon [[Chevrolet Monza]] (now owned by Re-Car's Allan Browne) on his way to winning the [[1984 Australian GT Championship|Australian GT Championship]], and he also drove at Le Mans in a Porsche 956 (he also joined the television commentary team for Surfers Paradise). George Fury was also missing mid-season when [[Gibson Motor Sport|Nissan]] team boss Howard Marsden decided to concentrate on car development following a couple of non-finishes, while reigning champion Moffat missed the last three rounds of the series through injury.\n\nThe 1984 ATCC saw the [[ABC1|ABC]] televise each round of the series live throughout Australia. It was the first time that one television station had covered the entire series, previously the ABC and [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] had shared the broadcast rights. It would be the last time the ABC covered the ATCC as Seven took over from [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship|1985]] when the locally developed Group C rules were replaced by the [[FIA]]'s International [[Group A]] touring car regulations.

1984\n}}\nThe '''1984 Australian Touring Car Championship''' was a [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]] sanctioned [[Australia]]n motor racing title for [[Group C Touring Cars]].<ref name=CAMS1984>Conditions for Australian Titles, 1984 CAMS Manual of Motor Sport, pages 88-93</ref> It was the 25th running of the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]],<ref name=Howard>Graham Howard, Stewart Wilson & David Greenhalgh, 1984 - Bye bye big bangers, The official history - Australian Touring Car Championship - 50 Years, 2011, pages 244-253</ref> and the last to be contested by [[Group C (Australia)|Group C]] cars as new regulations,<ref name=Howard/> based on international [[Group A]],<ref>Touring Cars, 1985 CAMS Manual of Motor Sport, pages 300-303</ref> were introduced for 1985.<ref name=Howard/> The championship, which began on 18 February 1984 at [[Sandown Raceway]] and ended on 1 July at [[Adelaide International Raceway]] after seven rounds, was won by [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] driving a [[Ford XE Falcon]].\n\n==Season Summary==\nJohnson's win gave [[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford]] and its [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] both the first and last ATCC wins under Group C regulations as [[Allan Moffat]] won the [[1973 Australian Touring Car Championship|1973 ATCC]] in a [[Ford Falcon GTHO Phase III|Falcon XY GTHO Phase III]].<ref name=\"TVGuide\">2004 V8 Supercars TV Guide</ref> The win was also Ford's 12th ATCC win since the championship began in [[1960 Australian Touring Car Championship|1960]] and the Falcon's 6th win overall after having previously won in 1973, [[1976 Australian Touring Car Championship|1976]], [[1977 Australian Touring Car Championship|1977]] (all Moffat), [[1981 Australian Touring Car Championship|1981]] and [[1982 Australian Touring Car Championship|1982]] (both Johnson). It was also the Falcon's last championship win until [[1993 Australian Touring Car Championship|1993]].\n\n1984 saw the first ever ATCC race win by a [[turbocharged]] car when [[George Fury]] won the 6th round at a wet [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside Raceway]] just north of [[Brisbane]] driving a [[Datsun Bluebird 910|Nissan Bluebird Turbo]].\n\n[[Peter Brock]], driving a [[Marlboro Holden Dealer Team]] entered [[Holden VH Commodore|Holden Commodore]], was the only driver to win more than once, with victories in the opening rounds at [[Sandown Raceway|Sandown]] and [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]]. Johnson's only win in the series was at the 4th round at [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]], though he never finished lower than 3rd in any other round. [[Allan Grice]] won the last round at [[Adelaide International Raceway|Adelaide]] (his last ever ATCC race win), and thus the distinction of winning the last ATCC race run under Group C rules. Defending champion [[Allan Moffat]] only won one round of the series, at [[Barbagallo Raceway|Wanneroo Park]], and suffered a crash at Surfers Paradise in which he not only wrote off his [[Mazda RX-7]], but also broke bones in his right hand and suffered a fractured sternum, forcing him out of the series (in fact, Moffat would not appear in another ATCC race until round 4 of the [[1988 Australian Touring Car Championship|1988 series]] at Wanneroo). The only other winner was former champion [[Bob Morris (racing driver)|Bob Morris]] who introduced some flavour to the series when he made a comeback to the sport in 1984, winning Round 5 at [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] in an RX-7 fitted with a standard gearbox after the teams only race unit was broken in practice. Holden Commodore driver Warren Cullen finished 4th in the championship and was the only driver other than Dick Johnson to finish every round of the series.\n\nUnfortunately for the final ATCC run under the local Group C rules, with the exception of Dick Johnson, [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] contesting his first ATCC in his [[JPS Team BMW|JPS Team]] [[BMW E24|BMW 635 CSi]], Warren Cullen's two car Commodore team backed by [[K-Mart]] with new teammate Andrew Harris in his [[1982 James Hardie 1000|1982]] and 1983 Bathurst winning ex-HDT Commodore, and [[1983 Australian Endurance Championship|1983 Australian Endurance Champion]] [[Peter McLeod]] in his Slick 50 Mazda RX-7, the series was devoid of many of its big name drivers from mid-season. Peter Brock missed both [[Queensland]] rounds due to his commitment to race a [[Porsche 956]] with his [[Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] winning co-driver [[Larry Perkins]] at the [[1984 1000 km of Silverstone|1000 km of Silverstone]] and [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] races and was substituted in both races by teammate [[John Harvey (racing driver)|John Harvey]] having his first ATCC drive since [[1979 Australian Touring Car Championship|1979]]. After the [[Roadways Racing]] team lost their STP sponsorship (though still running a single car for Steve Harrington), Allan Grice struggled to find enough sponsorship other than SAAS Wheels to run his rented Roadways Commodore for the entire series and missed most of the mid-season rounds, during which time he drove the ex-[[Bob Jane]] DeKon [[Chevrolet Monza]] (now owned by Re-Car's Allan Browne) on his way to winning the [[1984 Australian GT Championship|Australian GT Championship]], and he also drove at Le Mans in a Porsche 956 (he also joined the television commentary team for Surfers Paradise). George Fury was also missing mid-season when [[Gibson Motor Sport|Nissan]] team boss Howard Marsden decided to concentrate on car development following a couple of non-finishes, while reigning champion Moffat missed the last three rounds of the series through injury.\n\nThe 1984 ATCC saw the [[ABC1|ABC]] televise each round of the series live throughout Australia. It was the first time that one television station had covered the entire series, previously the ABC and [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] had shared the broadcast rights. It would be the last time the ABC covered the ATCC as Seven took over from [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship|1985]] when the locally developed Group C rules were replaced by the [[FIA]]'s International [[Group A]] touring car regulations. The commentators for the ABC telecasts were Will Hagon and John Smailes with [[Tim Lane (journalist)|Tim Lane]], [[Neil Crompton]], Bob Vincent, Bob Morris and Allan Grice joining them at selected rounds.\n\n==Teams and drivers==\nThe following teams and drivers competed in the 1984 [[Australian Touring Car Championship]]. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!Team\n!Car

Secondly, that by recruiting Frenchmen Britain was changing the nature of the war with France, and showing that it wanted to overturn the French Revolutionary government. [[Charles James Fox]], one of the MPs who said most on this, thought the war would be longer and more violent as a result, and negotiating a peace much harder.

Secondly, that by recruiting Frenchmen Britain was changing the nature of the war with France, and showing that it wanted to overturn the French Revolutionary government. [[Charles James Fox]], one of the MPs who said most on this, thought the war would be longer and more violent as a result, and negotiating a peace much harder.

The memorial foundation was running a deficit of almost $255,000, the newspaper said, and had more than $2 million in unpaid debts.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> The paper suggested that the foundation's spending was the problem. Nonprofit \"watchdog\" groups said charities should spend 75 percent on their mission program, 15 percent on administration, and just 10 percent on fundraising.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> But the DVLMF was spending 88 percent of its money on fundraising.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> The memorial foundation was strongly criticized on this point by watchdog groups. [[Charity Navigator]]{{'s}} Sandra Miniutti said her group gave the foundation zero out of four stars (its lowest rating) and scored DVLMF's operations: \"Their finances are out of whack, and it appears they are not adhering to their mission\".<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> Charity Brands Marketing, a group which helps match donors to charities, was also highly critical. Their chief executive officer, Stephen Adler, warned DVLMF was spending too heavily on fundraising: \"The numbers tell the story, and that's not an acceptable number for a nonprofit\".<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> The ''Palm Beach Post'' also reported that Lois Pope had used money from her LIFE Foundation to keep the DVLMF afloat. The DVLMF was $267,089 in deficit by the end of 2001, and the LIFE Foundation's 2002 donation of $3.5 million had kept it afloat.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> Rick Fenstermacher, an DVLMF consultant, admitted that Pope had pledged even more, but declined to say how much the additional donation was worth.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" />\n\nThe DVLMF categorically denied it was in any financial difficulty. It admitted spending $4.9 million on fundraising in 2005, most of it to purchase personalized items such as coffee mugs, T-shirts, stadium  blankets, and umbrellas to mail to potential donors.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> But such expenditures were paying off, it said. The foundation had mailed 8.5 million letters to potential donors by March 2007, and received 749,306 donations with an average value of $16.58.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> Fenstermacher asserted that steep initial investment costs were to be expected, and that non-final 2006 fundraising figures were \"stellar\".<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> Bob Montgomery, Pope's attorney, also justified the fundraising strategy. \"You have to have parties...,\" he told the ''Palm Beach Post'', noting that people gave money at these types of events.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> He pointed to a gala hosted in 2006 by the DVLMF in Palm Beach which raised $500,000.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" />\n\nAnother scandal hit the DVLMF in 2007 when Lois Pope was sued by her son, Paul D.

Representative [[Dennis Moore (politician)|Dennis Moore]] (D-[[Kansas]]) introduced H.R. 634 in January 2007, and it passed the House 416-to-0 in May.<ref name=\"DAVMagSigns\">{{cite news|title=President Signs Memorial Coin Bill|newspaper=DAV Magazine|date=September 1, 2008}}</ref> Senator Tim Johnson then introduced companion legislation (S. 2119) in the Senate in October 2007.<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnson Initiates Act to Create Coin Honoring Vets|newspaper=Bismarck Tribune|date=October 7, 2007}}</ref> The DVLMF told members of Congress that the foundation had raised roughly $43 million of the $65 million needed to build the memorial, and that commemorative coin sales would allow it to complete fundraising in 2008.<ref name=\"JacksonPushes\" /> The [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate Banking Committee]] favorably reported the legislation on May 20, 2008, with clarifying legislation from Senator Johnson.<ref name=\"KivlanBoost\" /> The Senate adopted the amended bill by a unanimous vote on June 10,<ref name=\"DAVMagSigns\" /> and the House adopted the Senate bill on June 18.<ref>{{cite news|title=House Passes Johnson's Veteran Coin Act|newspaper=Aberdeen American News|date=June 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn July 17, 2008, President George W.

While the utilities that owned these lines could move them quickly, the cash-strapped District of Columbia required federal funds to assist it in managing the street closures and infrastructure improvements that would be made during the relocations. Because of this, the National Park Service declined to issue a construction permit until a program had been worked out to move these utilities and obtain these funds.<ref name=\"NearsFruit\" />\n\nConstruction of the memorial subsequently occurred in two phases. Phase I consisted of removing and rerouting fiber optic cables, broadband computer lines, telephone lines, and other communication lines from beneath the memorial site.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=10}} Phase II consisted of realigning the city streets and relocating traffic signals.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=10}}<ref name=\"DisabledTarget\" /> Work began on Phase I in the fall of 2011,<ref name=\"DisabledTarget\">{{cite news|title=Disabled Vet Memorial on Target|newspaper=VFW Magazine|date=October 2011|pages=26\u201327|url=http://digitaledition.qwinc.com/publication/?i=81188&p=28}}</ref> but the communications lines were not rerouted until fall 2012.<ref name=\"PepcoBegins\" /><ref name=\"Prep\" /> By November 2012, granite for the memorial was being quarried, and work on the bronze statues was under way.<ref name=\"DisabledTarget\" /> With Phase II construction to take 12 months,{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=10}} DVLMF officials said they hoped for a November 2013 dedication.<ref name=\"DisabledTarget\" />\n\nThroughout the latter half of 2011 and the first half of 2012, memorial foundation and D.C. officials sought the necessary highway construction funds.

The DVLMF hired Cloud Gehshan Associates to assist with the selection of quotations for the panels.

These panels were fabricated at the Walla Walla Foundry in [[Walla Walla, Washington]]. The process was much simpler than creating the glass panels. Sculptor Kirkland created a silhouette of the figures he wanted for the panels. Red wax slabs {{convert|6|by|8|ft|m|adj=on}} in size were created, and the shape cut into them by a computer-controlled router. The shapes did not need to be perfect, as Kirkland preferred a slightly imperfect image that gave the viewer the impression that the \"artist's hand\" was still crafting the work. The bronze panels were then cast using the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax]] method.<ref name=\"Cantwell\" />\n\nBy November 2012, all utilities except the electricity had been relocated.<ref name=\"DOTGrants\" /> In mid-December 2012, [[Pepco]] began relocation of the electrical line.<ref name=\"PepcoBegins\" /><ref name=\"Prep\">{{cite news|title=Preparations for Memorial Construction|newspaper=DAV Magazine|date=March 1, 2013}}</ref> DDOT said it would call for proposals to do the street work later that month, award a contract in January or February 2013, and begin construction work in March.<ref name=\"PepcoBegins\" /><ref name=\"Prep\" /><ref name=\"DOTGrants\" />\n\nBy this time it was not exactly clear what the DVLMF's construction timeline was, however.

Historic Preservation Office.<ref name=\"DvorakPatience\">{{cite news|last=Dvorak|first=Petula|title=Patience Key to Paying Homage|newspaper=Washington Post|date=January 23, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe first design element imposed on the memorial regarded the site.  In approving the memorial foundation's preferred site in October 2001, the NCPC said that the site should be configured to allow C Street SW to be restored to its historic alignment. This changed slightly the geometry of the memorial site, and restricted the amount of on-site parking which the memorial planners desired.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|page=2}}\n\nTo design the memorial on the slightly restricted site, the memorial foundation held a design competition. On November 11, 2002, the DVLMF invited about 20 architects and [[landscape architecture|landscape architects]] to submit design proposals for the memorial. Six firms responded with a proposal. The DVLMF established a nine-member design committee consisting of members of the foundation's Board of Directors as well as architects, artists, and landscape architects. In February 2003, the six proposals were presented anonymously to the design committee. Two firms, Michael Vergason Landscape Architects and Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects, were asked to submit a refined proposal. This second proposal included, among other things, cost estimates, a project schedule, and a scale model. The design committee submitted a list of questions to each firm, and asked them to address the questions in their second submission. Each firm was also asked to discuss possible design alternatives. In July 2003, the design committee selected Michael Vergason Landscape Architects as the memorial designer. The DVLMF Board of Directors affirmed the choice.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201410}}\n\nVergason's winning design envisioned a plot that formed a [[right triangle]], with the [[right angle]] in the southwest corner of the site. Along the sidewalks that formed the legs of the triangle were dense rows of trees.  Slightly inward from the right angle was a [[pentagon]]-shaped paved area whose tip was aimed at the southwest corner of the site. Within this paved area, two walls formed a partial top of another pentagon, while two walls formed complete sides to it. The base of this shape, which faced northeast, was open to provide a view of the U.S. Capitol. Within the pentagonal area bounded by these walls was a fountain with a pentagon-shaped bowl. Aligned with the base of the paved pentagonal area was the edge of the reflecting pool.  Beginning near the tip of the pentagonal paving area were stone walls, approximately {{convert|15|ft|m}} high, which extended to the northern and southeastern tips of the site. These walls had rectangular windows in them, and they were inscribed with quotations about democracy, sacrifice, and honor. Paralleling the stone wall, creating a path about {{convert|10|ft|m}} in width, were glass walls approximately {{convert|12|ft|m}} high on which images of disabled veterans were inscribed. The glass walls were also to carry stories about disabled veterans and quotations from them about the meaning of their military service and the sacrifices they made.  The northeastern side of the right triangle site formed the base of a trapezoidal reflecting pool.  Its sides were the glass wall, and its top the edge of the paved area.  Trees partially lined the northeastern side of the site, with a gap in them to permit views of the Capitol.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201411}}\n\n===Initial design===\n[[File:Original design proposal - American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial - 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Original design proposal for the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial.]]\nVergason's initial design underwent changes before being submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts for approval.  It now consisted of five elements. The first was the fountain. The fountain, intended to be the center of the memorial, was still located near the southwestern corner of the site. But instead of pentagonal shaped, the fountain was now a circular granite basin which contained both water and an [[eternal flame]].{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3\u20134}}{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=7}} The flame was about {{convert|12|to|18|in|cm}} high, and was designed to gout higher during times of war or national emergency.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=7}} A circular area around the fountain was paved with specially colored stones to emphasize its centrality to the site.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=7}} The second element were the stone walls and trees.  The white, marble-faced stone walls were now called the \"Walls of Loss\", and Vergason intended for them to be inscribed with stories from disabled veterans documenting how they were wounded, their reactions to their disabilities, and the way they felt society treated them.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3\u20134}} Circular openings in the stone walls helped maintain a sense of openness (as opposed to being walled in).{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|page=4}} The west and south sides of the site continued to be lined with trees, but the stone walls no longer connected with the paved area around the fountain. The stone walls were also no longer continuous, so as not to create the sense that the memorial was walled off from the surrounding area. The third element was the triangular reflecting pool, which extended south and east from the fountain,{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3\u20134}} with trees at the north end emerging from the water at seemingly random points.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8\u20139}} An opening in the grove on the northeast portion of the site still permitted views of the U.S. Capitol. The fourth element was the glass walls. These were moved inward, away from the stone walls, to form trapezoidal paved areas that formed paths guiding the visitor between the various groves of trees.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3\u20134}} These trapezoidal, paved areas were oriented toward the north, or main, entrance to the memorial.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8\u20139}} They also created partial walls forcing visitors to use one of the memorial's three entrances. (In addition to the memorial's primary entrance on the north end,{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3\u20134}}{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8\u20139}} entrances existed in the southeast and southwest corners.) The glass walls were now called the \"Walls of Light\". Vergason intended for these walls to be more uplifting, and to be inscribed with quotes about democracy, honor, sacrifice service, duty, and patriotism.  The fifth element consisted of the masses of trees around the site.  Nearly the entire site would be paved with grey granite, and grey granite benches would be placed in strategic locations to force visitors to view the Capitol and fountain from the best angles. The memorial also had a flagpole,{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=9}} and Vergason intended for \"works of art\" to be placed around the memorial site (although the nature of these artworks had yet to be determined).{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3\u20134}}\n\nCFA members were, on the whole, positive and enthusiastic about the memorial design, but they also had a number of criticisms. First, the memorial seemed to be merely a collection of elements rather than a unified design. The memorial designers were asked to simply and harmonize the design, and reduce the number of elements if possible.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8\u20139}}{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201412}} Member [[Diana Balmori]], a landscape architect, made the specific suggestion that the fountain and pool be combined, and the flame placed in the pool.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=9}} Second, the large number of interior walls on the site created areas that ignored the street alignments which gave the site shape.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8\u20139}} While the DVLMF believed nearly all visitors would come from the north (with pedestrians coming from the Capitol, [[United States Botanic Garden]], and the [[National Museum of the American Indian]]), the CFA questioned this assumption and asked that pedestrian flow be studied.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8\u20139}}{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201412}} Finally, CFA members thought that raising and lowering the flame would trivialize the memorial,{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=8}} the flagpole should be located in less intrusive place, and that the trees in the reflecting pool would create serious maintenance problems.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=9}} Nonetheless, the CFA approved the memorial's preliminary design on March 18, 2004.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201412}}\n\nThe National Capital Planning Commission approved the preliminary design concept of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial on April 1, 2004.<ref name=\"WardFinal\" />{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201412}} However, the NCPC made three requests of the memorial's planners. First, they asked them to continue to study vehicular movement around the memorial and refine the design and site plot accordingly. Second, they asked the planners to study the ways pedestrians would cross busy Independence Avenue SW, 2nd Street SW, and Washington Avenue SW, and to make design refinements based on these studies. Third, the NCPC asked that the circular holes in the stone walls, which disconcertingly looked like gun ports, be redesigned.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|page=4}}\n\n===First revised design===\n[[File:Overhead view - American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|The first revised design for the memorial.]]\nA revised design was submitted to the CFA as well as to the NCPC in June 2005.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201412}} In the revised design, the fountain was now a simple basin (without water jets) in the shape of a star, with the eternal flame at its center.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} A thin scrim of water surrounded the flame, making it appear as if the fire were emerging from the water itself.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3\u20134}} The northeastern sides and arms of the star spilled water over into a reflecting pool.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} Extending northwest and southeast from the star-shaped basin was a triangular reflecting pool whose long edge bordered Washington Avenue. Both the star-shaped basin and the reflecting pool were intended to be of black granite.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} Both the basin and the reflecting pool were designed to have as little rippling water as possible, so as best to reflect both the eternal flame and the Capitol building.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} Trees lined the edges of the reflecting pool, except for an opening on the northeast portion of the site (which permitted views of the U.S. Capitol). The length of the stone and glass walls was now much reduced, and they were set near the trees on the western and southern edges of the site. The memorial's primary entrance was still considered to be on the north end, but stone walls came close together in the southwest corner of the site to create a major secondary entrance.  The white marble-faced stone walls were called the \"Walls of Loss\", and Vergason intended for them to be inscribed with stories from disabled veterans documenting how they were wounded, their reactions to their disabilities, and the way they felt society treated them.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3\u20134}} Circular openings in the stone walls helped maintain a sense of openness rather than being walled off.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|page=4}} The glass walls were called the \"Walls of Light\". Vergason intended for these walls to be more uplifting, and to be inscribed with quotes about democracy, honor, sacrifice service, duty, and patriotism.  Nearly the entire site would be paved with grey granite, and grey granite benches would be placed in strategic locations to force visitors to the Capitol and fountain from the best angles. Vergason also intended for \"works of art\" to be placed around the memorial site, although the nature of these artworks had yet to be determined.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3\u20134}} The revised design still returned C Street SW to its original configuration in the L'Enfant Plan.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=4\u20143}} All steps and grade changes were eliminated and special-needs parking along C Street SW increased to make the memorial more handicapped-accessible.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}}\n\nThe CFA received an update on this first revision in July 2005. The DVLMF had hired sculptor Larry Kirkland as the designer of the artworks, and Vergason emphasized strongly that Kirkland was very much a member of the design team. These artworks were to be bronze panels, {{convert|9|ft|m}} tall,<ref name=\"HannelPlanners\" /> [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] in style but with some abstraction, and life-size human bodies with missing limbs.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} Each panel featured a [[Relief#Counter-relief|counter-relief]] image of a human body, each missing one or more limbs. Sample panels included full human bodies, headless bodies, and single body parts.<ref name=\"DvorakHorror\">{{cite news|last=Dvorak|first=Petula|title=The Horror of War, in Granite and Glass|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 22, 2005}}</ref>{{Efn|Kirkland said, \"I had begun to think about the issues of the disabled and came up with the idea of a figure being in negative\".

Three of the sculptures would be associated with the eastern wall and one with the north wall, be placed between the glass walls (which were envisioned to be {{convert|8|to|9|ft|m}} in height) and the taller marble-clad walls. The DVLMF had also contracted with Kirkland to assist with the inscriptions on the glass and stone walls. Kirkland reported that the northern wall was intended to express gratitude toward disabled veterans, while the eastern wall would provide quotations from disabled veterans themselves.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} More than 700 quotations had been collected, he said.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}}<ref name=\"DvorakHorror\" /> Although no quotations had yet been selected, the designers were mindful of picking text that related to the statues. Each glass wall would consist of five layers of glass, laminated together. Quotations would be inscribed on an inner layer, so that the exterior remained smooth. Inscriptions would be placed at different layers at different points within the wall, and the number and grouping of quotations would be varied. Both elements would help to achieve a diverse appearance. CFA members generally applauded the revisions and were positive about Kirkland's preliminary statue and glass wall designs.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} But they emphasized that the memorial still lacked a hierarchy of design and was too complex. \"There were too many elements \u2013 fire, a star, water, two kinds of walls, writing, sculpture, landscaping \u2013 but there was no clear hierarchy,\" said one member of the CFA.<ref name=\"DvorakPatience\" />\n\n===Second revised design===\nThe first revised design was being tweaked in March 2006<ref name=\"HannelPlanners\" /> when a major design change occurred.\n\nBecause of concerns expressed by the Architect of the Capitol and the [[United States Capitol Police]]<ref name=\"JacksonPushes\" /> that a realigned C Street SW might provide an easy route for a [[Car bomb|truck bomb]] to be used against one of the House of Representatives' office buildings, C Street was now designed to dead-end at 2nd Street SW.<ref name=\"NearsFruit\" />{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|pages=2, 4}}{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}} This radically altered the site's southern boundary, extending it southward and forcing a reconsideration of the memorial's entire design.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}<ref name=\"PepcoBegins\" /> However, since a portion of the site was also given to the Architect of the Capitol, the site's size was reduced to just {{convert|1.72|acre|m2}}.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=4}}\n\nThe second revised design was submitted to the CFA in November 2006. This new design moved the five-pointed<ref name=\"GrimaldiActorWks\" /> star-shaped basin to the northern tip of the site.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=4}} The eternal flame remained at the center of the basin.<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" /><ref name=\"GrimaldiActorWks\" /> To provide an unobstructed view of the Capitol, no trees would line the northern half of the northeastern side of the site.  The stone walls were reduced so that they now only occurred in two long sections on the western side of the site, and a pedestrian walkway was added in the much-expanded southern grove of trees to allow office workers to move through the site.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}} To maintain handicapped-accessibility, the new plan widened 2nd Street NW and added a lane nearest the memorial for bus and special-needs parking.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=4}} The range of quotations on the stone wall were now limited only to expressions of loss and the nation's gratitude.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}} Because of the diminution of the screening walls and a more limited number of trees, which reduced traffic noise, the star-shaped basin was now raised to a height of about {{convert|3|ft|m}}. A cascade of water {{convert|30|in|cm}} high led from the basin to the tree-lined reflecting pool. This cascade, it was hoped, would make [[white noise]] which would reduce the intrusiveness of the traffic noises.<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" />{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}<ref name=\"GrimaldiActorWks\" /> The reflecting pool was now capable of being drained quickly to be used as a platform for events, rallies, or commemorations. Changes were made to the glass walls as well, which were now scattered in the larger grove of trees on the southern portion of the site. Vergason said that the glass panels (confirmed to be {{convert|8|ft|m}} high) would reflect the trees and visitors reading their inscriptions. The bronze panels were reduced in number to four,<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" /> each one depicting the silhouette of a veteran with missing body parts.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}} Addressing landscape concerns, Vergason said the large, southern grove of trees would consist of [[Ginkgo biloba|ginkgo]], with [[Taxodium distichum|bald cypress]] along 2nd Street.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=4}} Disease-resistant [[Ulmus americana|American elms]] would be planted in a double-row along Washington Avenue.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=4}} Vergason confirmed that grey granite would be used for the plaza, and black granite for the bottom of the basin and pool. Lighting would be provided by standard CFA-approved single-globe or double-globe [[Street lighting in the District of Columbia|lighting standards]]. Spotlights on poles would illuminate the bronze sculptural panels, and the glass panels would be lit from behind and below by ground lamps.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}{{Efn|The lamps lighting the glass panels from behind and below were later changed to [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lights.}}{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\nSome elements were still in flux, however. Ground plantings had not been selected yet, and the depth of the reflecting pool and the direction of its water flow were undecided. Also not yet finalized were how to handle the water features in winter. The National Park Service wished to drain both water elements, but memorial planners were hoping to maintain a low level of water in the star-shaped basin year-round. The height and style of the reflecting pool's edge was also unclear, as it depended on the direction of the water flow and other details. Among the designs being considered were a low, flat edge which could serve as seating; a low, angled edge which discouraged seating; and no edge, in which case the reflecting pool would be nearly level with the plaza. The design of benches, and their placement, was also still under discussion.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}\n\nAlthough the Commission of Fine Arts still expressed some concerns with the memorial's design, it approved the second revised concept on November 16, 2006.<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" />{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}\n\nThe National Capital Planning Commission approved the second revised concept on November 30, 2006.<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" /><ref>{{cite report|author=National Capital Planning Commission|title=Commission Action: American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, Bounded By C, 2nd Street SW, and Washington Avenue.

The group also asked the memorial planners to consider not just physically handicapped individuals but also those with visual and hearing impairments when designing the memorial's accessibility features. These elements should not be added later, but incorporated into the design, NCPC members stressed. Finally, the agency expressed its ongoing concern over pedestrian access.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=6}}\n\n===Third revised design===\nBoth the CFA and NCPC still needed to give their final approval to the design, however.<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" />\n\nThe third revised design was presented to the Commission of Fine Arts on July 17, 2008. Two firms had been hired by the memorial planners to assist the design team: Fluidity Design Consultants, which helped with the design of the star-shaped fountain; and Cloud Gehshan Associates, which worked on the glass panels and artworks. The first major change to the memorial design involved the star-shaped basin, which no longer overflowed into the triangular reflecting pool. Now the fountain overflowed itself, with water passing down its sides into a trough at the base of the structure. The overflow was designed to be a quiet one. The basin's underlying stone was no longer black granite, but the same grey granite as the rest of the plaza. The height of the star-shaped basin was also raised to {{convert|34|in|m}} above the plaza, to make it a more visible and dramatic part of the memorial's design. (The height of the fountain permitted someone in a wheelchair to see the flame, but was also high enough to discourage a person from climbing into the water and approaching the flame.) The fountain was designed to be turned off in winter, although the basin would not be drained. A sensor system would detect if anyone climbed into the fountain's basin, and turn off the flame as a protective measure. The nature of the eternal flame had also been further refined. The new plan called for five stones to protrude slightly above the water. Just out of sight below the surface of the water, jets would allow natural gas to bubble to the surface. As the bubbles broke the surface, igniters hidden in the stones would cause the gas to burst into a {{convert|3|ft|m}} high flame. Sensors would adjust the flow of gas and the operation of the igniters to accommodate weather (such as wind or rain).{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\nThe second major change to the memorial's design involved the glass walls and bronze artwork. Placed on the northern edge of the southern gingko tree grove, these four freestanding glass walls\u2014now called \"Voices of Veterans\"\u2014would not only contain quotations and other inscriptions but also photo-realistic images of disabled veterans. Each glass \"wall\" consisted of 17 or 18 panels, with each panel {{convert|4|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|8|to|9|ft|m}} high, and {{convert|2.25|in|cm}} thick. A {{convert|0.5|in|cm|adj=on}} gap between each panel permitted the movement of air. About 30 quotations would be used. The images would depict disabled veterans from the [[American Civil War]] to the present, although the quotations extended back to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The number of rectangular bronze panels now numbered five, and they were to be placed behind some of the glass walls. These artworks passed light through to the glass walls as well as helped create a stronger visual element than glass alone. Trees in the grove would have their limbs removed up to a height of about {{convert|10|to|12|ft|m}} to provide visibility, and a planting bed about {{convert|8|ft|m}} deep behind the glass panels would discourage anyone from approaching them from behind. Kirkland said that as the bronze panels evolved, both veterans and DVLMF board members began questioning whether they effectively depicted the experiences of disabled veterans.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}{{Efn|According to Kirkland: \"But [when the initial design for the bronze panels] got back to the (Disabled American Veterans organization)...they didn't understand it. ... That the disabled vets didn't understand it told me I hadn't done my research.\" Kirkland also said the National Park Service was worried about the concept of \"bronze body parts strewn around the lot\".}}<ref name=\"Cantwell\" /> It became clear that a more photo-realistic approach was needed, but this could only be accommodated by the glass panels. The designers realized that glass panels with only quotations was not dynamic enough, and that the bronze elements would help present the idealized elements that the photo-realistic images could not.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\nSeveral small changes were also made to the rest of the memorial. The overall size of the reflecting pool was reduced to just {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} in length. The height of the pool was raised so it was about {{convert|10|in|cm}} off the ground, which gave the pool a more \"honorific\" quality. The reflecting pool was designed to be drained in winter, leaving a flat expanse of stone. The \"Walls of Loss\" was now called the \"Wall of Gratitude\", and designers said it would be {{convert|14|ft|m}} high. The northern segment of this wall would not only contain the name of the memorial, but also include several quotations and the seals of each branch of the armed services as well.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\nThe CFA requested a site visit to see in-place mock-ups for the stone and glass walls and their lighting. The effectiveness of the photo-realistic elements were questioned by some members of the CFA, who pointed out that they created a time-bound (rather than timeless) memorial and had proven ineffective at the [[Korean War Veterans Memorial]].{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}} Several commissioners also expressed very strong concern over the significant changes in the bronze panels. But CFA chair [[Earl A. Powell III]] (himself a Vietnam War veteran) strongly endorsed it, which appeared to mute these concerns.<ref name=\"Cantwell\" /> [[United States Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs]] [[Gordon H. Mansfield]], a Vietnam War veteran who was paralyzed in combat, spoke movingly before the CFA in favor of the revised bronzes. Mansfield's testimony, given as a paralyzed individual and not in an official capacity, also helped to win over the CFA.<ref name=\"Cantwell\" /> The CFA also asked that the designers study the spacing and placement of the glass panels, the size of the gap between the two segments of the stone wall, and whether the stone wall might be broke into three or more sections. Commission members noted that the spotlights on poles might be eliminated, suggesting that light from surrounding buildings and street lights made them unnecessary. They requested a nighttime lighting study from the memorial planners to help decide the issue.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\nThe Commission approved the third revised concept on July 17, 2008.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\n===Final design===\n[[File:ADVLM final plan.jpg|thumb|left|National Capital Planning Commission architectural drawing of the layout of the memorial's final design.]]\nAs requested, the DVLMF manufactured mock-ups of the glass and bronze panels.  The site visit was held in early March 2009. Mock-ups of the glass panels were placed in their planned locations, and various sticks and flags indicated the position and height of other memorial elements. CFA members made minor suggestions regarding the opacity of the lettering and the typography on the glass panels, and expressed ongoing concern about the site's accessibility. Commission members also asked that the memorial planners to study whether the \"Wall of Gratitude\" was so high as to block views of the U.S. Capitol from points east, to consider widening the pedestrian access points in the wall, and to reduce further the size of the reflecting pool. Another site visit, with more details about the water elements and lighting scheme, was planned.<ref>{{cite report|author=Commission of Fine Arts|url=http://www.cfa.gov/meetings/2009/mar/avdl_sitereport.html|title=American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Site Report|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Commission of Fine Arts|date=March 26, 2009|pages=1\u20132|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe second site visit was held in May 2009. The memorial's designers had once more reduced the size of the reflecting pool and also widened the walkways and access points. Commission members stressed that art was more important than the quotations on the glass panels, and made two suggestions: First, that more images be added, and second, that the images be made more complex to heighten their impact. The memorial planners discussed the \"Wall of Gratitude\" height study and the nighttime ambient street lighting study with the commission. The decision was made to limit the wall's height to {{convert|12|ft|mm}}, and to eliminate the pole lights. The members of the CFA said they believed that, pending resolution of these issues, the memorial was ready for final approval, and requested a final design approval submission (complete with a description of all materials and plantings as well as material samples).<ref>{{cite report|author=Commission of Fine Arts|url=http://www.cfa.gov/meetings/2009/may/20090521_02.html|title=American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, Square 580, Washington Avenue (Canal Street), 2nd and C Streets, SW.

A nearly complete mockup of the artwork was prepared and viewed by the commissioners prior to the meeting. The commission was extremely pleased with the final site plan and made a single minor suggestion (ensure even distribution of illumination along the Wall of Gratitude).

The placement of the remaining glass walls was adjusted, and the number of glass panels reduced from 70 to 49.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=4}} Per the request of the Commission of Fine Arts, the height of the \"Wall of Gratitude\" was reduced from {{convert|14|ft|m}} to {{convert|12|ft|m}}.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=6}} At the request of the National Park Service, this wall was now composed of granite, which was more durable than marble.<ref name=\"NearsFruit\" /> The American elms planned for Washington Avenue were replaced with gingko,{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=7}} and the pole-mounted lights and ground-level lighting for the glass panels eliminated. Small LED lights were added to the top and back of each glass panel, and LED lights were used to underlight each granite bench.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=9}} Accessibility elements for special-needs individuals were also incorporated into the submitted final design. All crosswalks now had [[tactile paving]] and audible crosswalk signals. Seating height within the memorial was adjusted to be more accessible to the physically impaired, and the memorial planners had reached an agreement with the Architect of the Capitol to provide special needs parking south of the memorial site. To assist those who were visually impaired, the memorial now also provided an [[audio tour]], accessed for free via [[cell phone]], which described the memorial's art and components and provided an interpretive description of them.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=11}}\n\nOn July 1, 2010, the National Capital Planning Commission gave its approval to the memorial's final site design.<ref name=\"NearsFruit\" /><ref>{{cite report|author=National Capital Planning Commission|url=http://www.ncpc.gov/DocumentDepot/Actions_Recommendations/2010July/American_Veterans_Disabled_for_Life_Memorial_Action_6179_July2010_.pdf|title=Commission Action: American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, C Street, SW, 2nd Street, SW and Washington Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C.

Humphrey Building]], headquarters of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]; adjacent to and northeast of the Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Federal Building; and southeast and adjacent to the Bartholdi Fountain portion of the grounds of the United States Botanic Garden. The site is federally owned, and under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u20148}}\n\nThe memorial was designed by Michael Vergason of Michael Vergason Landscape Architects, with sculptor Larry Kirkland consulting. Architectural services were supplied by [[Shalom Baranes Associates]], and engineering services by RK&K Engineers. Technical assistance for the fountain and reflecting pool were provided by Fluidity, Inc.  Technical assistance in graphic design was provided by Cloud Gehshan Associates, and consultant [[Claude Engle]] assisted with the lighting design.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=10}}\n\nThe memorial consists of five elements:\n*The first element is a fountain in the shape of a five-pointed star, {{convert|30|in|m}} in height and set on the northern end of the site.

Two igniters, hidden among five decorative stones which just break the surface, ignite the gas, which rises to a flame about {{convert|3|ft|m}} high (although this varies due to weather). Sensors monitor the flame to ensure a smooth flow of gas and that the igniters function properly. Pressure sensors in the basin automatically stop the flow of gas should anyone attempt to climb into the fountain. The system is monitored and controlled remotely via the Internet, allowing both the operator (the National Park Service) and the fabricator (Technifex) to operate the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avdlm.org/ceremonial-flame|title=Ceremonial Flame|website=American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial|year=2014|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> The fountain is designed to remain filled but not overflow during winter months.\n*The second element is a reflecting pool which extends south and southeast from the star-shaped fountain.

Brown introduced Pope to Art Wilson,<ref name=\"SmithBiteOff\" /> the National Adjutant (e.g., chief executive officer) of the [[Disabled American Veterans]] (DAV), an organization founded in 1920 to assist disabled veterans.

The memorial foundation was running a deficit of almost $255,000, the newspaper said, and had more than $2 million in unpaid debts.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> The paper suggested that the foundation's spending was the problem. Nonprofit \"watchdog\" groups said charities should spend 75 percent on their mission program, 15 percent on administration, and just 10 percent on fundraising.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> But the DVLMF was spending 88 percent of its money on fundraising.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> The memorial foundation was strongly criticized on this point by watchdog groups. [[Charity Navigator]]{{'s}} Sandra Miniutti said her group gave the foundation zero out of four stars (its lowest rating) and scored DVLMF's operations: \"Their finances are out of whack, and it appears they are not adhering to their mission\".<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> Charity Brands Marketing, a group which helps match donors to charities, was also highly critical. Their chief executive officer, Stephen Adler, warned DVLMF was spending too heavily on fundraising: \"The numbers tell the story, and that's not an acceptable number for a nonprofit\".<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> The ''Palm Beach Post'' also reported that Lois Pope had used money from her LIFE Foundation to keep the DVLMF afloat. The DVLMF was $267,089 in deficit by the end of 2001, and the LIFE Foundation's 2002 donation of $3.5 million had kept it afloat.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> Rick Fenstermacher, an DVLMF consultant, admitted that Pope had pledged even more, but declined to say how much the additional donation was worth.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" />\n\nThe DVLMF categorically denied it was in any financial difficulty. It admitted spending $4.9 million on fundraising in 2005, most of it to purchase personalized items such as coffee mugs, T-shirts, stadium  blankets, and umbrellas to mail to potential donors.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> But such expenditures were paying off, it said. The foundation had mailed 8.5 million letters to potential donors by March 2007, and received 749,306 donations with an average value of $16.58.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> Fenstermacher asserted that steep initial investment costs were to be expected, and that non-final 2006 fundraising figures were \"stellar\".<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> Bob Montgomery, Pope's attorney, also justified the fundraising strategy. \"You have to have parties...,\" he told the ''Palm Beach Post'', noting that people gave money at these types of events.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" /> He pointed to a gala hosted in 2006 by the DVLMF in Palm Beach which raised $500,000.<ref name=\"MillerUnderFire\" />\n\nAnother scandal hit the DVLMF in 2007 when Lois Pope was sued by her son, Paul D.

While the utilities that owned these lines could move them quickly, the cash-strapped District of Columbia required federal funds to assist it in managing the street closures and infrastructure improvements that would be made during the relocations.

Red wax slabs {{convert|6|by|8|ft|m|adj=on}} in size were created, and the shape cut into them by a computer-controlled router.

In approving the memorial foundation's preferred site in October 2001, the NCPC said that the site should be configured to allow C Street SW to be restored to its historic alignment. This changed slightly the geometry of the memorial site, and restricted the amount of on-site parking which the memorial planners desired.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|page=2}}\n\nTo design the memorial on the slightly restricted site, the memorial foundation held a design competition. On November 11, 2002, the DVLMF invited about 20 architects and [[landscape architecture|landscape architects]] to submit design proposals for the memorial. Six firms responded with a proposal. The DVLMF established a nine-member design committee consisting of members of the foundation's Board of Directors as well as architects, artists, and landscape architects. In February 2003, the six proposals were presented anonymously to the design committee. Two firms, Michael Vergason Landscape Architects and Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects, were asked to submit a refined proposal. This second proposal included, among other things, cost estimates, a project schedule, and a scale model. The design committee submitted a list of questions to each firm, and asked them to address the questions in their second submission. Each firm was also asked to discuss possible design alternatives. In July 2003, the design committee selected Michael Vergason Landscape Architects as the memorial designer. The DVLMF Board of Directors affirmed the choice.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201410}}\n\nVergason's winning design envisioned a plot that formed a [[right triangle]], with the [[right angle]] in the southwest corner of the site. Along the sidewalks that formed the legs of the triangle were dense rows of trees.  Slightly inward from the right angle was a [[pentagon]]-shaped paved area whose tip was aimed at the southwest corner of the site. Within this paved area, two walls formed a partial top of another pentagon, while two walls formed complete sides to it. The base of this shape, which faced northeast, was open to provide a view of the U.S. Capitol. Within the pentagonal area bounded by these walls was a fountain with a pentagon-shaped bowl. Aligned with the base of the paved pentagonal area was the edge of the reflecting pool.  Beginning near the tip of the pentagonal paving area were stone walls, approximately {{convert|15|ft|m}} high, which extended to the northern and southeastern tips of the site. These walls had rectangular windows in them, and they were inscribed with quotations about democracy, sacrifice, and honor. Paralleling the stone wall, creating a path about {{convert|10|ft|m}} in width, were glass walls approximately {{convert|12|ft|m}} high on which images of disabled veterans were inscribed. The glass walls were also to carry stories about disabled veterans and quotations from them about the meaning of their military service and the sacrifices they made.  The northeastern side of the right triangle site formed the base of a trapezoidal reflecting pool.  Its sides were the glass wall, and its top the edge of the paved area.  Trees partially lined the northeastern side of the site, with a gap in them to permit views of the Capitol.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201411}}\n\n===Initial design===\n[[File:Original design proposal - American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial - 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Original design proposal for the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial.]]\nVergason's initial design underwent changes before being submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts for approval.  It now consisted of five elements. The first was the fountain. The fountain, intended to be the center of the memorial, was still located near the southwestern corner of the site. But instead of pentagonal shaped, the fountain was now a circular granite basin which contained both water and an [[eternal flame]].{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3-4}}{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=7}} The flame was about {{convert|12|to|18|in|cm}} high, and was designed to gout higher during times of war or national emergency.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=7}} A circular area around the fountain was paved with specially colored stones to emphasize its centrality to the site.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=7}} The second element were the stone walls and trees.  The white, marble-faced stone walls were now called the \"Walls of Loss\", and Vergason intended for them to be inscribed with stories from disabled veterans documenting how they were wounded, their reactions to their disabilities, and the way they felt society treated them.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3-4}} Circular openings in the stone walls helped maintain a sense of openness (as opposed to being walled in).{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|page=4}} The west and south sides of the site continued to be lined with trees, but the stone walls no longer connected with the paved area around the fountain. The stone walls were also no longer continuous, so as not to create the sense that the memorial was walled off from the surrounding area. The third element was the triangular reflecting pool, which extended south and east from the fountain,{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3-4}} with trees at the north end emerging from the water at seemingly random points.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8-9}} An opening in the grove on the northeast portion of the site still permitted views of the U.S. Capitol. The fourth element was the glass walls. These were moved inward, away from the stone walls, to form trapezoidal paved areas that formed paths guiding the visitor between the various groves of trees.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3-4}} These trapezoidal, paved areas were oriented toward the north, or main, entrance to the memorial.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8-9}} They also created partial walls forcing visitors to use one of the memorial's three entrances. (In addition to the memorial's primary entrance on the north end,{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3-4}}{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8-9}} entrances existed in the southeast and southwest corners.) The glass walls were now called the \"Walls of Light\". Vergason intended for these walls to be more uplifting, and to be inscribed with quotes about democracy, honor, sacrifice service, duty, and patriotism.  The fifth element consisted of the masses of trees around the site.  Nearly the entire site would be paved with grey granite, and grey granite benches would be placed in strategic locations to force visitors to view the Capitol and fountain from the best angles. The memorial also had a flagpole,{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=9}} and Vergason intended for \"works of art\" to be placed around the memorial site (although the nature of these artworks had yet to be determined).{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3-4}}\n\nCFA members were, on the whole, positive and enthusiastic about the memorial design, but they also had a number of criticisms. First, the memorial seemed to be merely a collection of elements rather than a unified design. The memorial designers were asked to simply and harmonize the design, and reduce the number of elements if possible.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8-9}}{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201412}} Member [[Diana Balmori]], a landscape architect, made the specific suggestion that the fountain and pool be combined, and the flame placed in the pool.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=9}} Second, the large number of interior walls on the site created areas that ignored the street alignments which gave the site shape.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8-9}} While the DVLMF believed nearly all visitors would come from the north (with pedestrians coming from the Capitol, [[United States Botanic Garden]], and the [[National Museum of the American Indian]]), the CFA questioned this assumption and asked that pedestrian flow be studied.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|pages=8-9}}{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201412}} Finally, CFA members thought that raising and lowering the flame would trivialize the memorial,{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=8}} the flagpole should be located in less intrusive place, and that the trees in the reflecting pool would create serious maintenance problems.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2004|page=9}} Nonetheless, the CFA approved the memorial's preliminary design on March 18, 2004.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201412}}\n\nThe National Capital Planning Commission approved the preliminary design concept of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial on April 1, 2004.<ref name=\"WardFinal\" />{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201412}} However, the NCPC made three requests of the memorial's planners. First, they asked them to continue to study vehicular movement around the memorial and refine the design and site plot accordingly. Second, they asked the planners to study the ways pedestrians would cross busy Independence Avenue SW, 2nd Street SW, and Washington Avenue SW, and to make design refinements based on these studies. Third, the NCPC asked that the circular holes in the stone walls, which disconcertingly looked like gun ports, be redesigned.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|page=4}}\n\n===First revised design===\n[[File:Overhead view - American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|The first revised design for the memorial.]]\nA revised design was submitted to the CFA as well as to the NCPC in June 2005.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u201412}} In the revised design, the fountain was now a simple basin (without water jets) in the shape of a star, with the eternal flame at its center.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} A thin scrim of water surrounded the flame, making it appear as if the fire were emerging from the water itself.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3-4}} The northeastern sides and arms of the star spilled water over into a reflecting pool.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} Extending northwest and southeast from the star-shaped basin was a triangular reflecting pool whose long edge bordered Washington Avenue. Both the star-shaped basin and the reflecting pool were intended to be of black granite.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} Both the basin and the reflecting pool were designed to have as little rippling water as possible, so as best to reflect both the eternal flame and the Capitol building.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} Trees lined the edges of the reflecting pool, except for an opening on the northeast portion of the site (which permitted views of the U.S. Capitol). The length of the stone and glass walls was now much reduced, and they were set near the trees on the western and southern edges of the site. The memorial's primary entrance was still considered to be on the north end, but stone walls came close together in the southwest corner of the site to create a major secondary entrance.  The white marble-faced stone walls were called the \"Walls of Loss\", and Vergason intended for them to be inscribed with stories from disabled veterans documenting how they were wounded, their reactions to their disabilities, and the way they felt society treated them.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3-4}} Circular openings in the stone walls helped maintain a sense of openness rather than being walled off.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|page=4}} The glass walls were called the \"Walls of Light\".

Vergason also intended for \"works of art\" to be placed around the memorial site, although the nature of these artworks had yet to be determined.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2004|pages=3-4}} The revised design still returned C Street SW to its original configuration in the L'Enfant Plan.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=4\u20143}} All steps and grade changes were eliminated and special-needs parking along C Street SW increased to make the memorial more handicapped-accessible.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}}\n\nThe CFA received an update on this first revision in July 2005. The DVLMF had hired sculptor Larry Kirkland as the designer of the artworks, and Vergason emphasized strongly that Kirkland was very much a member of the design team. These artworks were to be bronze panels, {{convert|9|ft|m}} tall,<ref name=\"HannelPlanners\" /> [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] in style but with some abstraction, and life-size human bodies with missing limbs.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} Each panel featured a [[Relief#Counter-relief|counter-relief]] image of a human body, each missing one or more limbs.

Three of the sculptures would be associated with the eastern wall and one with the north wall, be placed between the glass walls (which were envisioned to be {{convert|8|to|9|ft|m}} in height) and the taller marble-clad walls. The DVLMF had also contracted with Kirkland to assist with the inscriptions on the glass and stone walls. Kirkland reported that the northern wall was intended to express gratitude toward disabled veterans, while the eastern wall would provide quotations from disabled veterans themselves.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} More than 700 quotations had been collected, he said.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}}<ref name=\"DvorakHorror\" /> Although no quotations had yet been selected, the designers were mindful of picking text that related to the statues. Each glass wall would consist of five layers of glass, laminated together. Quotations would be inscribed on an inner layer, so that the exterior remained smooth. Inscriptions would be placed at different layers at different points within the wall, and the number and grouping of quotations would be varied. Both elements would help to achieve a diverse appearance. CFA members generally applauded the revisions and were positive about Kirkland's preliminary statue and glass wall designs.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2005|page=1}} But they emphasized that the memorial still lacked a hierarchy of design and was too complex. \"There were too many elements -- fire, a star, water, two kinds of walls, writing, sculpture, landscaping -- but there was no clear hierarchy,\" said one member of the CFA.<ref name=\"DvorakPatience\" />\n\n===Second revised design===\nThe first revised design was being tweaked in March 2006<ref name=\"HannelPlanners\" /> when a major design change occurred.\n\nBecause of concerns expressed by the Architect of the Capitol and the [[United States Capitol Police]]<ref name=\"JacksonPushes\" /> that a realigned C Street SW might provide an easy route for a [[Car bomb|truck bomb]] to be used against one of the House of Representatives' office buildings, C Street was now designed to dead-end at 2nd Street SW.<ref name=\"NearsFruit\" />{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|pages=2, 4}}{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}} This radically altered the site's southern boundary, extending it southward and forcing a reconsideration of the memorial's entire design.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}<ref name=\"PepcoBegins\" /> However, since a portion of the site was also given to the Architect of the Capitol, the site's size was reduced to just {{convert|1.72|acre|m2}}.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=4}}\n\nThe second revised design was submitted to the CFA in November 2006. This new design moved the five-pointed<ref name=\"GrimaldiActorWks\" /> star-shaped basin to the northern tip of the site.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=4}} The eternal flame remained at the center of the basin.<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" /><ref name=\"GrimaldiActorWks\" /> To provide an unobstructed view of the Capitol, no trees would line the northern half of the northeastern side of the site.  The stone walls were reduced so that they now only occurred in two long sections on the western side of the site, and a pedestrian walkway was added in the much-expanded southern grove of trees to allow office workers to move through the site.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}} To maintain handicapped-accessibility, the new plan widened 2nd Street NW and added a lane nearest the memorial for bus and special-needs parking.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=4}} The range of quotations on the stone wall were now limited only to expressions of loss and the nation's gratitude.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}} Because of the diminution of the screening walls and a more limited number of trees, which reduced traffic noise, the star-shaped basin was now raised to a height of about {{convert|3|ft|m}}. A cascade of water {{convert|30|in|cm}} high led from the basin to the tree-lined reflecting pool. This cascade, it was hoped, would make [[white noise]] which would reduce the intrusiveness of the traffic noises.<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" />{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}<ref name=\"GrimaldiActorWks\" /> The reflecting pool was now capable of being drained quickly to be used as a platform for events, rallies, or commemorations. Changes were made to the glass walls as well, which were now scattered in the larger grove of trees on the southern portion of the site. Vergason said that the glass panels (confirmed to be {{convert|8|ft|m}} high) would reflect the trees and visitors reading their inscriptions. The bronze panels were reduced in number to four,<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" /> each one depicting the silhouette of a veteran with missing body parts.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}} Addressing landscape concerns, Vergason said the large, southern grove of trees would consist of [[Ginkgo biloba|ginkgo]], with [[Taxodium distichum|bald cypress]] along 2nd Street.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=4}} Disease-resistant [[Ulmus americana|American elms]] would be planted in a double-row along Washington Avenue.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=4}} Vergason confirmed that grey granite would be used for the plaza, and black granite for the bottom of the basin and pool. Lighting would be provided by standard CFA-approved single-globe or double-globe [[Street lighting in the District of Columbia|lighting standards]]. Spotlights on poles would illuminate the bronze sculptural panels, and the glass panels would be lit from behind and below by ground lamps.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}{{Efn|The lamps lighting the glass panels from behind and below were later changed to [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lights.}}{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\nSome elements were still in flux, however. Ground plantings had not been selected yet, and the depth of the reflecting pool and the direction of its water flow were undecided. Also not yet finalized were how to handle the water features in winter. The National Park Service wished to drain both water elements, but memorial planners were hoping to maintain a low level of water in the star-shaped basin year-round. The height and style of the reflecting pool's edge was also unclear, as it depended on the direction of the water flow and other details. Among the designs being considered were a low, flat edge which could serve as seating; a low, angled edge which discouraged seating; and no edge, in which case the reflecting pool would be nearly level with the plaza. The design of benches, and their placement, was also still under discussion.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}\n\nAlthough the Commission of Fine Arts still expressed some concerns with the memorial's design, it approved the second revised concept on November 16, 2006.<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" />{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2006|page=1}}\n\nThe National Capital Planning Commission approved the second revised concept on November 30, 2006.<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" /><ref>{{cite report|author=National Capital Planning Commission|title=Commission Action: American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, Bounded By C, 2nd Street SW, and Washington Avenue.

The group also asked the memorial planners to consider not just physically handicapped individuals but also those with visual and hearing impairments when designing the memorial's accessibility features. These elements should not be added later, but incorporated into the design, NCPC members stressed. Finally, the agency expressed its ongoing concern over pedestrian access.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2006|page=6}}\n\n===Third revised design===\nBoth the CFA and NCPC still needed to give their final approval to the design, however.<ref name=\"StearnsCoins\" />\n\nThe third revised design was presented to the Commission of Fine Arts on July 17, 2008. Two firms had been hired by the memorial planners to assist the design team: Fluidity Design Consultants, which helped with the design of the star-shaped fountain; and Cloud Gehshan Associates, which worked on the glass panels and artworks. The first major change to the memorial design involved the star-shaped basin, which no longer overflowed into the triangular reflecting pool. Now the fountain overflowed itself, with water passing down its sides into a trough at the base of the structure. The overflow was designed to be a quiet one. The basin's underlying stone was no longer black granite, but the same grey granite as the rest of the plaza. The height of the star-shaped basin was also raised to {{convert|34|in|m}} above the plaza, to make it a more visible and dramatic part of the memorial's design. (The height of the fountain permitted someone in a wheelchair to see the flame, but was also high enough to discourage a person from climbing into the water and approaching the flame.) The fountain was designed to be turned off in winter, although the basin would not be drained. A sensor system would detect if anyone climbed into the fountain's basin, and turn off the flame as a protective measure. The nature of the eternal flame had also been further refined. The new plan called for five stones to protrude slightly above the water. Just out of sight below the surface of the water, jets would allow natural gas to bubble to the surface. As the bubbles broke the surface, igniters hidden in the stones would cause the gas to burst into a {{convert|3|ft|m}} high flame. Sensors would adjust the flow of gas and the operation of the igniters to accommodate weather (such as wind or rain).{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\nThe second major change to the memorial's design involved the glass walls and bronze artwork. Placed on the northern edge of the southern gingko tree grove, these four freestanding glass walls\u2014now called \"Voices of Veterans\"\u2014would not only contain quotations and other inscriptions but also photo-realistic images of disabled veterans. Each glass \"wall\" consisted of 17 or 18 panels, with each panel {{convert|4|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|8|to|9|ft|m}} high, and {{convert|2.25|in|cm}} thick. A {{convert|0.5|in|cm|adj=on}} gap between each panel permitted the movement of air. About 30 quotations would be used. The images would depict disabled veterans from the [[American Civil War]] to the present, although the quotations extended back to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The number of rectangular bronze panels now numbered five, and they were to be placed behind some of the glass walls. These artworks passed light through to the glass walls as well as helped create a stronger visual element than glass alone. Trees in the grove would have their limbs removed up to a height of about {{convert|10|to|12|ft|m}} to provide visibility, and a planting bed about {{convert|8|ft|m}} deep behind the glass panels would discourage anyone from approaching them from behind. Kirkland said that as the bronze panels evolved, both veterans and DVLMF board members began questioning whether they effectively depicted the experiences of disabled veterans.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}{{Efn|According to Kirkland: \"But [when the initial design for the bronze panels] got back to the (Disabled American Veterans organization)...they didn't understand it. ... That the disabled vets didn't understand it told me I hadn't done my research.\" Kirkland also said the National Park Service was worried about the concept of \"bronze body parts strewn around the lot\".}}<ref name=\"Cantwell\" /> It became clear that a more photo-realistic approach was needed, but this could only be accommodated by the glass panels. The designers realized that glass panels with only quotations was not dynamic enough, and that the bronze elements would help present the idealized elements that the photo-realistic images could not.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\nSeveral small changes were also made to the rest of the memorial. The overall size of the reflecting pool was reduced to just {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} in length. The height of the pool was raised so it was about {{convert|10|in|cm}} off the ground, which gave the pool a more \"honorific\" quality. The reflecting pool was designed to be drained in winter, leaving a flat expanse of stone. The \"Walls of Loss\" was now called the \"Wall of Gratitude\", and designers said it would be {{convert|14|ft|m}} high. The northern segment of this wall would not only contain the name of the memorial, but also include several quotations and the seals of each branch of the armed services as well.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\nThe CFA requested a site visit to see in-place mock-ups for the stone and glass walls and their lighting. The effectiveness of the photo-realistic elements were questioned by some members of the CFA, who pointed out that they created a time-bound (rather than timeless) memorial and had proven ineffective at the [[Korean War Veterans Memorial]].{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}} Several commissioners also expressed very strong concern over the significant changes in the bronze panels. But CFA chair [[Earl A. Powell III]] (himself a Vietnam War veteran) strongly endorsed it, which appeared to mute these concerns.<ref name=\"Cantwell\" /> [[United States Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs]] [[Gordon H. Mansfield]], a Vietnam War veteran who was paralyzed in combat, spoke movingly before the CFA in favor of the revised bronzes. Mansfield's testimony, given as a paralyzed individual and not in an official capacity, also helped to win over the CFA.<ref name=\"Cantwell\" /> The CFA also asked that the designers study the spacing and placement of the glass panels, the size of the gap between the two segments of the stone wall, and whether the stone wall might be broke into three or more sections. Commission members noted that the spotlights on poles might be eliminated, suggesting that light from surrounding buildings and street lights made them unnecessary. They requested a nighttime lighting study from the memorial planners to help decide the issue.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\nThe Commission approved the third revised concept on July 17, 2008.{{sfn|Commission of Fine Arts|2008|page=1}}\n\n===Final design===\n[[File:ADVLM final plan.jpg|thumb|left|National Capital Planning Commission architectural drawing of the layout of the memorial's final design.]]\nAs requested, the DVLMF manufactured mock-ups of the glass and bronze panels.  The site visit was held in early March 2009. Mock-ups of the glass panels were placed in their planned locations, and various sticks and flags indicated the position and height of other memorial elements. CFA members made minor suggestions regarding the opacity of the lettering and the typography on the glass panels, and expressed ongoing concern about the site's accessibility. Commission members also asked that the memorial planners to study whether the \"Wall of Gratitude\" was so high as to block views of the U.S. Capitol from points east, to consider widening the pedestrian access points in the wall, and to reduce further the size of the reflecting pool. Another site visit, with more details about the water elements and lighting scheme, was planned.<ref>{{cite report|author=Commission of Fine Arts|url=http://www.cfa.gov/meetings/2009/mar/avdl_sitereport.html|title=American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Site Report|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Commission of Fine Arts|date=March 26, 2009|pages=1\u20132|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe second site visit was held in May 2009. The memorial's designers had once more reduced the size of the reflecting pool and also widened the walkways and access points. Commission members stressed that art was more important than the quotations on the glass panels, and made two suggestions: First, that more images be added, and second, that the images be made more complex to heighten their impact. The memorial planners discussed the \"Wall of Gratitude\" height study and the nighttime ambient street lighting study with the commission. The decision was made to limit the wall's height to {{convert|12|ft|mm}}, and to eliminate the pole lights. The members of the CFA said they believed that, pending resolution of these issues, the memorial was ready for final approval, and requested a final design approval submission (complete with a description of all materials and plantings as well as material samples).<ref>{{cite report|author=Commission of Fine Arts|url=http://www.cfa.gov/meetings/2009/may/20090521_02.html|title=American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, Square 580, Washington Avenue (Canal Street), 2nd and C Streets, SW.

A nearly complete mockup of the artwork was prepared and viewed by the commissioners prior to the meeting. The commission was extremely pleased with the final site plan and made a single minor suggestion (ensure even distribution of illumination along the Wall of Gratitude).

The placement of the remaining glass walls was adjusted, and the number of glass panels reduced from 70 to 49.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=4}} Per the request of the Commission of Fine Arts, the height of the \"Wall of Gratitude\" was reduced from {{convert|14|ft|m}} to {{convert|12|ft|m}}.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=6}} At the request of the National Park Service, this wall was now composed of granite, which was more durable than marble.<ref name=\"NearsFruit\" /> The American elms planned for Washington Avenue were replaced with gingko,{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=7}} and the pole-mounted lights and ground-level lighting for the glass panels eliminated. Small LED lights were added to the top and back of each glass panel, and LED lights were used to underlight each granite bench.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=9}} Accessibility elements for special-needs individuals were also incorporated into the submitted final design. All crosswalks now had [[tactile paving]] and audible crosswalk signals. Seating height within the memorial was adjusted to be more accessible to the physically impaired, and the memorial planners had reached an agreement with the Architect of the Capitol to provide special needs parking south of the memorial site. To assist those who were visually impaired, the memorial now also provided an [[audio tour]], accessed for free via [[cell phone]], which described the memorial's art and components and provided an interpretive description of them.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=11}}\n\nOn July 1, 2010, the National Capital Planning Commission gave its approval to the memorial's final site design.<ref name=\"NearsFruit\" /><ref>{{cite report|author=National Capital Planning Commission|url=http://www.ncpc.gov/DocumentDepot/Actions_Recommendations/2010July/American_Veterans_Disabled_for_Life_Memorial_Action_6179_July2010_.pdf|title=Commission Action: American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, C Street, SW, 2nd Street, SW and Washington Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C.

Humphrey Building]], headquarters of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]; adjacent to and northeast of the Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Federal Building; and southeast and adjacent to the Bartholdi Fountain portion of the grounds of the United States Botanic Garden. The site is federally owned, and under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service.{{sfn|National Park Service|2005|page=1\u20148}}\n\nThe memorial was designed by Michael Vergason of Michael Vergason Landscape Architects, with sculptor Larry Kirkland consulting. Architectural services were supplied by [[Shalom Baranes Associates]], and engineering services by RK&K Engineers. Technical assistance for the fountain and reflecting pool were provided by Fluidity, Inc.  Technical assistance in graphic design was provided by Cloud Gehshan Associates, and consultant [[Claude Engle]] assisted with the lighting design.{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=10}}\n\nThe memorial consists of five elements:\n*The first element is a fountain in the shape of a five-pointed star, {{convert|30|in|m}} in height and set on the northern end of the site. The fountain is clad in a nearly black granite known as St. John's Black.<ref name=\"NearsFruit\" />{{sfn|National Capital Planning Commission|2010|page=7}} Water in the basin overflows the sides of the fountain, and is collected in a small trough at the base of the structure. In the center of the fountain is an eternal flame. Jets below the surface of the water generate bubbles of natural gas, which rise to the surface. Two igniters, hidden among five decorative stones which just break the surface, ignite the gas, which rises to a flame about {{convert|3|ft|m}} high (although this varies due to weather). Sensors monitor the flame to ensure a smooth flow of gas and that the igniters function properly. Pressure sensors in the basin automatically stop the flow of gas should anyone attempt to climb into the fountain. The system is monitored and controlled remotely via the Internet, allowing both the operator (the National Park Service) and the fabricator (Technifex) to operate the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avdlm.org/ceremonial-flame|title=Ceremonial Flame|website=American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial|year=2014|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> The fountain is designed to remain filled but not overflow during winter months.\n*The second element is a reflecting pool which extends south and southeast from the star-shaped fountain.

It was the first commercial radio station to broadcast on the FM band in Adelaide started by Paul Thompson of the Austereo Network. The first song played on air was \"Sultans of Swing\" by Dire Straits. Initially, SA-FM was somewhat of a fringe operation, hampered largely by the fact that many houses, and more importantly most contemporary cars, did not have the ability to receive FM radio broadcasts.\n\nLater, it changed its name to \"SAFM\", and altered its frequency slightly to 107.1&nbsp;MHz. A second frequency, 91.1&nbsp;MHz, was added as what was the first of many repeater frequencies in Adelaide, required due to Adelaide's sometimes problematic television and radio reception idiosyncrasies. The frequency was later changed to 90.3&nbsp;MHz and it continues to operate on that frequency.\n\nPrior to the commercial introduction of the Compact Disc audio format to the Australian market, SAFM obtained one of the first Sony CD consumer players, which was used on-air for demonstrating this new format to the public.\n\nSAFM was also the first station in the world to have \"Black Thunder\" promotional vehicles.\n\nBetween 1984 until 1993 it was the highest rating station in Adelaide and achieving its best survey results in the late '80s, spearheaded by the \"Morning Zoo\" breakfast show.  SAFM became number one again in 1999, holding that position until 2005, when it dropped back to third, behind the talk station [[FIVEaa]] and the music station [[Mix 102.3]].\n\nFrom its inception SAFM was an adult rock-based format, before switching to CHR in March 1996.  Then in November 2003, SAFM changed from CHR to an adult contemporary format, but both SAFM and [[Triple M Adelaide]] reverted to their original formats in December 2004.\n\nOn Monday 13 October 2014, it was announced that SAFM would relaunch as Hit 107 on Monday 20 October 2014 due to flagging ratings. Amos Gill and Daniela Pola were also announced as the new breakfast team.<ref>http://www.radiotoday.com.au/news/whats-new/5630-hit-107-adelaide-revealed.html</ref> On Monday 20 October 2014, Hit 107 was planning to sign on at 8:00 AM Adelaide Time. The final song before the rebrand was [[NSYNC]]'s, \"[[Bye Bye Bye]]\".

The Strath runs east to west for 2.5 miles and the river Blackwater flows through it to merge at the eastern end with another tributary to form the River Alness. The floor of the strath is mainly fields used for sheep grazing. The strath is surrounded by commercial pine forest, except to the north, which is dominated by the mountain [[Beinn Tharsuinn]] (2831&nbsp;ft). Traditionally the strath was populated by tenant crofters, however in recent years there has been an increase in the number of new homes and restorations, after many decades of gradual decline.\n\n== History ==\n\n===The Picts===\nEarliest evidence of habitation are still visible in Strathrusdale at the eastern end of the Strath, where there are a number of stone circles, which formed the base of Pictish [[roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]]. [[Picts]] lived in the area until the 10th century, which was part of the [[Kingdom of Fortriu]].
