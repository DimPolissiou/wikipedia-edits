Believers point to them as evidence of his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and identity as [[Messiah]], seated in [[Heaven]] on the right hand of God (the doctrine of the [[Exaltation of Christ]]).{{sfn|McGrath|2011|p=310}} Others interpret these accounts as visionary experiences.\n\n==Background==\n{{Gospel Jesus}}\n[[Image:Meister des Sch\u00f6ppinger Altars 001.jpg|thumb|Resurrection appearances. ''Clockwise from bottom:'' [[Resurrection]], ''[[Noli me tangere]]'', [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], [[Pentecost]] (Meister des [[Sch\u00f6ppingen|Sch\u00f6ppinger]], c. 1449, Pfarrkirche, [[Westfalen]]).]]\nThe resurrection of the flesh was a marginal belief in [[Second Temple Judaism]], i.e., Judaism of the time of Jesus.{{sfn|Endsj\u00f8|2009|p=145}} The idea of any resurrection at all first emerges clearly in the 2nd-century-BC [[Book of Daniel]], but as a belief in the resurrection of the soul alone.{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=72\u201373}} A few centuries later the Jewish historian Josephus, writing roughly in the same period as Paul and the authors of the gospels, says that the [[Essenes]] believed the soul to be immortal, so that while the body would return to dust the soul would go to a place fitting its moral character, righteous or wicked.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=79}} This, according to the gospels, was the stance of Jesus, who defended it in an exchange with the [[Sadducees]]: \"Those who are accounted worthy ... to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, for they ... are equal to the angels and are children of God...\" ({{Bibleref2|Mark 12:24\u201325, Luke 20:34\u201336}}).{{sfn|Tabor|2013|p=58}}\n\nThe Greeks, by contrast, had long held that a meritorious man could be resurrected as a god after his death (the process of [[apotheosis]]).{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=131}} The successors of [[Alexander the Great]] made this idea very well known throughout the Middle East, in particular through coins bearing his image \u2013 a privilege previously reserved for gods \u2013 and although originally foreign to the Romans, the doctrine was soon borrowed by the emperors for purposes of political propaganda.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=131}} According to the theology of Imperial Roman apotheosis, the earthly body of the recently deceased emperor vanished, he received a new and divine one in its place, and was then seen by credible witnesses;{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=133\u2013135}} thus, in a story similar to the Gospel appearances of the resurrected Jesus and the commissioning of the disciples, [[Romulus]], the founder of Rome, descended from the sky to command a witness to bear a message to the Romans regarding the city's greatness (\"Declare to the Romans the will of Heaven that my Rome shall be the capital of the world...\") before being taken up on a cloud.{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=46}}\n\nThe experiences of the risen Christ attested by the earliest written sources \u2013 the \"primitive Church\" creed of {{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians 15:3\u20135}}, Paul in {{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians 15:8}} and {{Bibleref2|Galatians 1:16}} \u2013 are ecstatic rapture events and \"invasions of heaven\".{{sfn|De Conick|2006|p=6}} A physical resurrection was unnecessary for this visionary mode of seeing the risen Christ, but the general movement of subsequent New Testament literature is towards the physical nature of the resurrection.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=181}} This development can be linked to the changing make-up of the Christian community: Paul and the earliest Christ-followers were Jewish, and [[Second Temple Judaism]] emphasised the life of the soul; the gospel-writers, in an overwhelmingly Greco-Roman church, stressed instead the pagan belief in the hero who is immortalised and deified in his physical body.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=183}} In this Hellenistic resurrection paradigm Jesus dies, is buried, and his body disappears (with witnesses to the empty tomb); he then returns in an immortalised physical body, able to appear and disappear at will like a god, and returns to the heavens which are now his proper home.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=182}}\n\n==Biblical accounts==\n[[File:Stom, Matthias - Le repas d'Emma\u00fcs.jpg|thumb|240px|''Supper at Emmaus'' by [[Matthias Stom]], c 1633\u20131639. The \"breaking of bread\" is the precise moment of the disciples' recognition that they are in the presence of the risen Christ]]\n{{See also|Template:Resurrection appearances|l1=Overview of resurrection appearances in the Gospels and Paul (table)}}\n\n===Earliest Jewish-Christian followers of Jesus===\nThe earliest report of the post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus is in Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]].{{sfn|Taylor|2014|p=374}} This lists, apparently in chronological order, a first appearance to Peter, then to \"the Twelve,\" then to five hundred at one time, then to James (presumably [[James the brother of Jesus]]), then to \"all the Apostles,\" and last to Paul hmself.{{sfn|Taylor|2014|p=374}} Paul does not mention any appearances to women, apart from \"sisters\" included in the 500; other New Testament sources do not mention any appearance to a crowd of 500.{{sfn|Taylor|2014|p=374}} There is general agreement that the list is pre-Pauline \u2013 it is often called a catechism of the early church \u2013 but less on how much of the list belongs to the tradition and how much is from Paul: most scholars feel that Peter and the Twelve are original, but not all believe the same of the appearances to the 500, James and \"all the Apostles\".{{sfn|Plevnik|2009|p=4-6}}{{NoteTag|name=\"Paul|Paul informs his readers that he is passing on what he has been told, \"that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.\"}}\n\n===Pauline epistles===\nBy claiming that Jesus has appeared to him in the same way he did to Peter, James and the others who had known Jesus in life, Paul bolsters his own claims to apostolic authority.{{sfn|Lehtipuu|2015|p=42}} In Galatians 1 he explains that his experience was a revelation both from Jesus (\"The gospel I preached ... I received by revelation from Jesus Christ\") and of Jesus (\"God ... was pleased to reveal His son in me\").{{sfn|Pate|2013|p=39, fn.5}} In 2 Corinthians 12 he tells his readers of \"a man in Christ who ... was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know \u2013 God knows;\"{{sfn|Chester|2007|p=394}} Elsewhere in the Epistles Paul speaks of \"glory\" and \"light\" and the \"face of Jesus Christ,\" and while the language is obscure it is plausible that he saw Jesus exalted, enthroned in heaven at the right hand of God.{{sfn|Chester|2007|p=394}} He has little interest in Jesus' resurrected body, except to say that it is not a this-worldly one: in his [[Letter to the Philippians]] he describes how the resurrected Christ is exalted in a new body utterly different from one he had when he wore \"the appearance of a man,\" and holds out a similar glorified state, when Christ \"will transform our lowly body,\" as the goal of the Christian life.{{sfn|Lehtipuu|2015|p=42-43}}\n\n===Gospels and Acts===\nThe [[gospel of Mark]] (written c.70 CE) contained no post-Resurrection appearances in its original version, which ended at [[Mark 16:8]], although Mark 16:7, in which the young man discovered in the tomb instructs the women to tell \"the disciples and Peter\" that Jesus will see them again in Galilee, hints that the author may have known of the tradition of 1 Thessalonians.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=74}}{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=149}}{{sfn|Parker|1997|p=125}}\n\nThe authors of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (c.80\u201390 CE) and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]/[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] (a two-part work by the same anonymous author, usually dated to around 80\u201390 CE) based their lives of Jesus on the Gospel of Mark.{{sfn|Charlesworth|2008|p=unpaginated}}{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=195}} As a result, they diverge widely after [[Mark 16:8]], where Mark ends with the discovery of the empty tomb. Matthew has two post-Resurrection appearances, the first to Mary Magdalene and \"the other Mary\" at the tomb, and the second, based on Mark 16:7, to all the disciples on a mountain in Galilee, where Jesus claims authority over heaven and Earth and commissions the disciples to preach the gospel to the whole world.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=127}} Luke does not mention any of the appearances reported by Matthew,{{sfn|McEwen|p=134}}  explicitly contradicts him regarding an appearance at the tomb (Luke 24:24), and replaces Galilee with Jerusalem as the sole location.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=149}} In Luke, Jesus appears to [[Cleopas]] and an unnamed disciple on the [[Road to Emmaus appearance|road to Emmaus]],  to [[Saint Peter|Peter]] (reported by the other apostles), and to the eleven remaining disciples at a meeting with others. The appearances reach their climax with the [[Ascension of Jesus]] before the assembled disciples on a mountain outside Jerusalem. In addition, Acts has appearances to Paul on the [[Road to Damascus]], to the martyr [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]], and to Peter, who hears the voice of Jesus.\n\n[[File:153fishes.jpg|thumb|240px|The ''miraculous catch of 153 fish'' by [[Duccio]], 14th century. Jesus is standing on the left, in the fourth resurrection appearance in John's gospel.]]\nThe [[Gospel of John]] was written some time after 80 or 90 CE.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=887\u2013888}} Jesus appears at the empty tomb to Mary Magdalene (who initially fails to recognise him), then to the disciples minus Thomas, then to all the disciples including Thomas (the \"[[doubting Thomas]]\" episode), finishing with an extended appearance in Galilee to Peter and six (not all) of the disciples.{{sfn|Quast|1991|p=130}} Chapter 21, the appearance in Galilee, is widely believed to be a later addition to the original gospel.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=888}}\n\n== Theological implications ==\nThe earliest Jewish followers of Jesus (the [[Jewish Christians]]) understood him as the Son of Man in the Jewish sense, a human who, through his perfect obedience to God's will, was resurrected and [[Ascension of Jesus|exalted to heaven]] in readiness to return at any moment as the [[Son of Man]], the supernatural figure seen in [[Daniel 7]]:13\u201314, ushering in and ruling over the [[Kingdom of God]].{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=154\u2013155}} Paul has already moved away from this apocalyptic tradition towards a position where [[Christology]] and [[soteriology]] take precedence: Jesus is no longer the one who proclaims the message of the imminently coming Kingdom, he actually ''is'' the kingdom, the one in whom the kingdom of God is already present.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=156}}\n\nThis is also the message of Mark, a gentile writing for a church of gentile Christians, for whom Jesus as \"Son of God\" has become a divine being whose suffering, death and resurrection are essential to God's plan for redemption.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=155}} Matthew presents Jesus' appearance in Galilee ([[Matthew 28:16]]\u2013[[Matthew 28:17|17]]) as a Greco-Roman apotheosis, the human body transformed to make it fitting for paradise.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=149}} He goes beyond the ordinary Greco-Roman forms, however, by having Jesus claim \"all authority ... in heaven and on earth\" ([[Matthew 28:18|28:18]]) \u2013 a claim no Roman hero would dare make \u2013 while charging the apostles to bring the whole world into a divine community of righteousness and compassion.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=150}} Notable too is that the expectation of the imminent Second Coming has been delayed: it will still come about, but first the whole world must be gathered in.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=150}}\n\nIn Paul and the first three gospels, and also in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], Jesus is portrayed as having the highest status, but the Jewish commitment to  [[monotheism]] prevents the authors from depicting him as fully one with God.{{sfn|Chester|2016|p=15}} This stage was reached first in the Christian community which produced the [[Johannine literature]]: only here in the New Testament does Jesus become God incarnate, the body of the resurrected Jesus bringing [[Doubting Thomas]] to exclaim, \"My Lord and my God!\"{{sfn|Chester|2016|p=15\u201316}}{{sfn|Vermes|2001|p=unpaginated}}\n\n==Explanations==\n\n===Evolution of resurrection beliefs===\nThe appearances of Jesus are often explained as [[Vision theory of Jesus' appearances|visionary experiences]], in which the presence of Jesus was felt.{{sfn|De Conick|2006|p=6}}{{sfn|Koester|2000|p=64-65}}{{sfn|Vermes|2008b|p=141}}{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|p=73}}{{sfn|Leman2015|p=168-169}} According to Finney, a physical resurrection was unnecessary for the visionary mode of seeing the risen Christ, but when the gospels of Matthew, Luke and John were being written, the emphasis had shifted to the physical nature of the resurrection, while still overlapping with the earlier concept of a divine exaltation of Jesus' soul.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=181}} This development can be linked to the changing make-up of the Christian community: Paul and the earliest Christ-followers were Jewish, and [[Second Temple Judaism]] emphasised the life of the soul; the [[gospel]]-writers, in an overwhelmingly Greco-Roman church, stressed instead the pagan belief in the hero who is immortalised and [[deified]] in his physical body.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=183}} {{Unreliable source|sure=y|reason=Finney appears to be doing fringe comparative religion of Christ-myth theorists. He believes the Christian community drue on a physical resurrection, though this is shown not be me the case in Mainstream scholarship.|date=February 2020}} However, critical New Testament scholar Gerd L\u00fcdemann states the earliest Christians believed in a bodily resurrection stating \"...we have no sound way to place the symbolic interpretation of Jesus' resurrection within the context of earliest Christian resurrection belief.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ludemann|first=Gerd|title=The Resurrection of Christ: A Historical Inquiry|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=180}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, New Testament scholar James Dunn argues that whereas the apostle Paul's resurrection experience was \"visionary in character\" and \"non-physical, non-material,\" the accounts in the Gospels and of the apostles mentioned by Paul are very different. He contends that the \"massive realism' [...] of the [Gospel] appearances themselves can only be described as visionary with great difficulty - and Luke would certainly reject the description as inappropriate,\" and that the earliest conception of resurrection in the Jerusalem Christian community was physical.<ref>James D.G.

Ehrman|Ehrman]], \"the disciples' belief in the resurrection was based on visionary experiences.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=98, 101}}{{NoteTag|[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman]] dismisses the story of the empty tomb; accoridng to Ehrman, \"an empty tomb had nothing to do with it [...] an empty tomb would not produce faith.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=98}}}} Ehrman notes that both Jesus and his early followers were apocalyptic Jews, who believed in the bodily resurrection, which would start when the coming of God's Kingdom was near.{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=99}} Ehrman further notes that visions usually have a strong persuasive power, but that the Gospel-accounts also record a tradition of doubt about the appearances of Jesus. Ehrman's \"tentative suggestion\" is that only a few followers had visions, including Peter, Paul and Mary. They told others about those visions, convincing most of their close associates that Jesus was raised from the dead, but not all of them. Eventually, these stories were retold and embellished, leading to the story that all disciples had seen the risen Jesus.{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=101-102}} The belief in Jesus' resurrection radically changed their perceptions, concluding from his absence that he must have been exalted to heaven, by God himself, exalting him to an unprecedented status and authority.{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=109-110}}\n\n====Call to missionary activity====\nAccording to [[Helmut Koester]], the stories of the resurrection were originally [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanies]] in which the disciples are called to a ministry by the risen Jesus, and at a secondary stage were interpreted as physical proof of the event. He contends that the more detailed accounts of the resurrection are also secondary and do not come from historically trustworthy sources, but instead belong to the genre of the narrative types.{{sfn|Koester|2000|p=64\u201365}}\n\nAccording to [[Gerd L\u00fcdemann]], Peter had a vision of Jesus, induced by his feelings of guilt of betraying Jesus. The vision elevated this feeling of guilt, and Peter experienced it as a real appearance of Jesus, raised from dead. He convinced the other disciples that the resurrection of Jesus signalled that the endtime was near and God's Kingdom was coming, when the dead who would rise again, as evidenced by Jesus. This revitalized the disciples, starting-off their new mission.<ref group=web name=\"Ehrman.L\u00fcdemann>Bart Ehrman (5 oct. 2012), [https://ehrmanblog.org/gerd-ludemann-on-the-resurrection-of-jesus-for-members/ ''Gerd L\u00fcdemann on the Resurrection of Jesus'']</ref>\n\nAccording to Biblical scholar [[G\u00e9za Vermes]], the resurrection is to be understood as a reviving of the self-confidence of the followers of Jesus, under the influence of the Spirit, \"prompting them to resume their apostolic mission.\" They felt the presence of Jesus in their own actions, \"rising again, today and tomorrow, in the hearts of the men who love him and feel he is near.\"{{sfn|Vermes|2008a|p=151\u2013152}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ascension of Jesus]]\n* [[Empty tomb]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[Resurrection of Jesus in Christian art]]\n* [[Third Nephi]], post-resurrection appearance of Jesus to people in the Americas as recounted in [[The Book of Mormon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Printed sources\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book \n|last1         = Barton\n|first1        = John\n|last2         = Muddiman\n|first2        = John\n|title         = The Pauline Epistles\n|publisher     = Oxford University Press\n|year          = 2010\n|url           = https://books.google.com/?id=Frw8BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA122&dq=%22Paul+supports+the+notion%22%22resurrection+appearances%22#v=onepage&q=%22Paul%20supports%20the%20notion%22%22resurrection%20appearances%22&f=false\n|ref           = harv\n|isbn          = 9780191034664\n}}\n*{{Cite book \n|last          = Burkett \n|first         = Delbert \n|title         = An introduction to the New Testament and the origins of Christianity \n|publisher     = Cambridge University Press \n|year          = 2002 \n|url           = https://books.google.com/books?id=EcsQknxV-xQC&pg=PA195#v=onepage&q=%2213%20The%20Gospel%20of%20Luke%22&f=false \n|ref           = harv\n|isbn          = 9780521007207 \n}}\n*{{Cite book \n| last         = Charlesworth\n| first        = James H. \n| title        = The Historical Jesus: An Essential Guide \n| publisher    = Abingdon Press \n| year         = 2008 \n| url          = https://books.google.com/books?id=YTIGy5t45WgC&pg=PT64#v=onepage&q=%22The%20composition%20of%20Luke-Acts%22%2C%22usually%20dated%20around%2080-90%22%2C%22perhaps%20between%2090%20and%20110%22&f=false \n| ref          = harv\n| isbn         = 9781426724756 \n}}\n*{{Cite book \n|last          = Chester \n|first         = Andrew \n|title         = Messiah and Exaltation: Jewish Messianic and Visionary Traditions and New Testament Christology\n|publisher     = Mohr Siebeck\n|year          = 2007 \n|url           = https://books.google.com/?id=0YJ3nxSYf0QC&pg=PA394&dq=%22Jesus+is+exalted+in+the+heavenly+world%22#v=onepage&q=%22Jesus%20is%20exalted%20in%20the%20heavenly%20world%22&f=false\n|ref           = harv\n|isbn          = 9783161490910 \n}}\n*{{Cite book \n| last         = Collins\n| first        = Adela Yarbro\n| chapter      = Ancient Notions of Transferal and Apotheosis\n| editor1-last = Seim \n| editor1-first= Turid Karlsen\n| editor2-last = \u00d8kland\n| editor2-first= Jorunn\n| title        = Metamorphoses: Resurrection, Body and Transformative Practices in Early Christianity\n| publisher    = Walter de Gruyter\n| year         = 2009\n| url          = https://books.google.com/?id=GCRjbbjW39EC&pg=PA46&dq=%22the+appearance+to+Proculus+Julius+is+similar%22#v=onepage&q=%22the%20appearance%20to%20Proculus%20Julius%20is%20similar%22&f=false\n| ref          = harv\n| isbn         = 9783110202991\n}}\n*{{Cite book \n|last          = Cotter\n|first         = Wendy\n|chapter       = Greco-Roman Apotheosis Traditions and the Resurrection in Matthew\n|editor1-last  = Thompson\n|editor1-first = William G.\n|title         = The Gospel of Matthew in Current Study\n|publisher     = Eerdmans \n|year          = 2001\n|url           = https://books.google.com/?id=E8lZ7BXzt0sC&pg=PA127&dq=%22the+Matthean+gospel+concludes+with+a+report%22#v=onepage&q=%22the%20Matthean%20gospel%20concludes%20with%20a%20report%22&f=false\n|ref           = harv\n|isbn          = 9780802846730\n}}\n*{{Cite book \n|last1         = De Conick\n|first1        = April D.\n|title         = Paradise Now: Essays on Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism\n|publisher     = SBL\n|year          = 2006\n|url           = https://books.google.com/?id=KUJ630m-CcwC&pg=PA6&dq=%22ecstatic+experiences%22%22in+the+form+of+rapture+events%22\n|ref           = harv\n|isbn          = 9781589832572\n}}\n<!-- E -->\n* {{Citation | last =Ehrman | first =Bart | year =2014 | title =How Jesus Became God.

Emmaus]]'', [[Caravaggio]] (1601-02) depicts the moment the disciples recognize Jesus.]]\n{{Death of Jesus}}\nThe '''post-resurrection appearances of Jesus''' are the reported earthly appearances of [[Jesus]] to his followers after his death and burial. Believers point to them as evidence of his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and identity as [[Messiah]], seated in [[Heaven]] on the right hand of God (the doctrine of the [[Exaltation of Christ]]).{{sfn|McGrath|2011|p=310}} Others interpret these accounts as visionary experiences.\n\n==Background==\n{{Gospel Jesus}}\n[[Image:Meister des Sch\u00f6ppinger Altars 001.jpg|thumb|Resurrection appearances. ''Clockwise from bottom:'' [[Resurrection]], ''[[Noli me tangere]]'', [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], [[Pentecost]] (Meister des [[Sch\u00f6ppingen|Sch\u00f6ppinger]], c. 1449, Pfarrkirche, [[Westfalen]]).]]\nThe resurrection of the flesh was a marginal belief in [[Second Temple Judaism]], i.e., Judaism of the time of Jesus.{{sfn|Endsj\u00f8|2009|p=145}} The idea of any resurrection at all first emerges clearly in the 2nd-century-BC [[Book of Daniel]], but as a belief in the resurrection of the soul alone.{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=72\u201373}} A few centuries later the Jewish historian Josephus, writing roughly in the same period as Paul and the authors of the gospels, says that the [[Essenes]] believed the soul to be immortal, so that while the body would return to dust the soul would go to a place fitting its moral character, righteous or wicked.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=79}} This, according to the gospels, was the stance of Jesus, who defended it in an exchange with the [[Sadducees]]: \"Those who are accounted worthy ... to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, for they ... are equal to the angels and are children of God...\" ({{Bibleref2|Mark 12:24\u201325, Luke 20:34\u201336}}).{{sfn|Tabor|2013|p=58}}\n\nThe Greeks, by contrast, had long held that a meritorious man could be resurrected as a god after his death (the process of [[apotheosis]]).{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=131}} The successors of [[Alexander the Great]] made this idea very well known throughout the Middle East, in particular through coins bearing his image \u2013 a privilege previously reserved for gods \u2013 and although originally foreign to the Romans, the doctrine was soon borrowed by the emperors for purposes of political propaganda.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=131}} According to the theology of Imperial Roman apotheosis, the earthly body of the recently deceased emperor vanished, he received a new and divine one in its place, and was then seen by credible witnesses;{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=133\u2013135}} thus, in a story similar to the Gospel appearances of the resurrected Jesus and the commissioning of the disciples, [[Romulus]], the founder of Rome, descended from the sky to command a witness to bear a message to the Romans regarding the city's greatness (\"Declare to the Romans the will of Heaven that my Rome shall be the capital of the world...\") before being taken up on a cloud.{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=46}}\n\nThe experiences of the risen Christ attested by the earliest written sources \u2013 the \"primitive Church\" creed of {{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians 15:3\u20135}}, Paul in {{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians 15:8}} and {{Bibleref2|Galatians 1:16}} \u2013 are ecstatic rapture events and \"invasions of heaven\".{{sfn|De Conick|2006|p=6}} A physical resurrection was unnecessary for this visionary mode of seeing the risen Christ, but the general movement of subsequent New Testament literature is towards the physical nature of the resurrection.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=181}} This development can be linked to the changing make-up of the Christian community: Paul and the earliest Christ-followers were Jewish, and [[Second Temple Judaism]] emphasised the life of the soul; the gospel-writers, in an overwhelmingly Greco-Roman church, stressed instead the pagan belief in the hero who is immortalised and deified in his physical body.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=183}} In this Hellenistic resurrection paradigm Jesus dies, is buried, and his body disappears (with witnesses to the empty tomb); he then returns in an immortalised physical body, able to appear and disappear at will like a god, and returns to the heavens which are now his proper home.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=182}}\n\n==Biblical accounts==\n[[File:Stom, Matthias - Le repas d'Emma\u00fcs.jpg|thumb|240px|''Supper at Emmaus'' by [[Matthias Stom]], c 1633\u20131639. The \"breaking of bread\" is the precise moment of the disciples' recognition that they are in the presence of the risen Christ]]\n{{See also|Template:Resurrection appearances|l1=Overview of resurrection appearances in the Gospels and Paul (table)}}\n\n===Earliest Jewish-Christian followers of Jesus===\nThe earliest report of the post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus is in Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]].{{sfn|Taylor|2014|p=374}} This lists, apparently in chronological order, a first appearance to Peter, then to \"the Twelve,\" then to five hundred at one time, then to James (presumably [[James the brother of Jesus]]), then to \"all the Apostles,\" and last to Paul himself.{{sfn|Taylor|2014|p=374}} Paul does not mention any appearances to women, apart from \"sisters\" included in the 500; other New Testament sources do not mention any appearance to a crowd of 500.{{sfn|Taylor|2014|p=374}} There is general agreement that the list is pre-Pauline \u2013 it is often called a catechism of the early church \u2013 but less on how much of the list belongs to the tradition and how much is from Paul: most scholars feel that Peter and the Twelve are original, but not all believe the same of the appearances to the 500, James and \"all the Apostles\".{{sfn|Plevnik|2009|p=4-6}}{{NoteTag|name=\"Paul|Paul informs his readers that he is passing on what he has been told, \"that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.\"}}\n\n===Pauline epistles===\nBy claiming that Jesus has appeared to him in the same way he did to Peter, James and the others who had known Jesus in life, Paul bolsters his own claims to apostolic authority.{{sfn|Lehtipuu|2015|p=42}} In Galatians 1 he explains that his experience was a revelation both from Jesus (\"The gospel I preached ... I received by revelation from Jesus Christ\") and of Jesus (\"God ... was pleased to reveal His son in me\").{{sfn|Pate|2013|p=39, fn.5}} In 2 Corinthians 12 he tells his readers of \"a man in Christ who ... was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know \u2013 God knows;\"{{sfn|Chester|2007|p=394}} Elsewhere in the Epistles Paul speaks of \"glory\" and \"light\" and the \"face of Jesus Christ,\" and while the language is obscure it is plausible that he saw Jesus exalted, enthroned in heaven at the right hand of God.{{sfn|Chester|2007|p=394}} He has little interest in Jesus' resurrected body, except to say that it is not a this-worldly one: in his [[Letter to the Philippians]] he describes how the resurrected Christ is exalted in a new body utterly different from one he had when he wore \"the appearance of a man,\" and holds out a similar glorified state, when Christ \"will transform our lowly body,\" as the goal of the Christian life.{{sfn|Lehtipuu|2015|p=42-43}}\n\n===Gospels and Acts===\nThe [[gospel of Mark]] (written c.70 CE) contained no post-Resurrection appearances in its original version, which ended at [[Mark 16:8]], although Mark 16:7, in which the young man discovered in the tomb instructs the women to tell \"the disciples and Peter\" that Jesus will see them again in Galilee, hints that the author may have known of the tradition of 1 Thessalonians.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=74}}{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=149}}{{sfn|Parker|1997|p=125}}\n\nThe authors of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (c.80\u201390 CE) and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]/[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] (a two-part work by the same anonymous author, usually dated to around 80\u201390 CE) based their lives of Jesus on the Gospel of Mark.{{sfn|Charlesworth|2008|p=unpaginated}}{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=195}} As a result, they diverge widely after [[Mark 16:8]], where Mark ends with the discovery of the empty tomb. Matthew has two post-Resurrection appearances, the first to Mary Magdalene and \"the other Mary\" at the tomb, and the second, based on Mark 16:7, to all the disciples on a mountain in Galilee, where Jesus claims authority over heaven and Earth and commissions the disciples to preach the gospel to the whole world.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=127}} Luke does not mention any of the appearances reported by Matthew,{{sfn|McEwen|p=134}}  explicitly contradicts him regarding an appearance at the tomb (Luke 24:24), and replaces Galilee with Jerusalem as the sole location.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=149}} In Luke, Jesus appears to [[Cleopas]] and an unnamed disciple on the [[Road to Emmaus appearance|road to Emmaus]],  to [[Saint Peter|Peter]] (reported by the other apostles), and to the eleven remaining disciples at a meeting with others. The appearances reach their climax with the [[Ascension of Jesus]] before the assembled disciples on a mountain outside Jerusalem. In addition, Acts has appearances to Paul on the [[Road to Damascus]], to the martyr [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]], and to Peter, who hears the voice of Jesus.\n\n[[File:153fishes.jpg|thumb|240px|The ''miraculous catch of 153 fish'' by [[Duccio]], 14th century. Jesus is standing on the left, in the fourth resurrection appearance in John's gospel.]]\nThe [[Gospel of John]] was written some time after 80 or 90 CE.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=887\u2013888}} Jesus appears at the empty tomb to Mary Magdalene (who initially fails to recognise him), then to the disciples minus Thomas, then to all the disciples including Thomas (the \"[[doubting Thomas]]\" episode), finishing with an extended appearance in Galilee to Peter and six (not all) of the disciples.{{sfn|Quast|1991|p=130}} Chapter 21, the appearance in Galilee, is widely believed to be a later addition to the original gospel.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=888}}\n\n== Theological implications ==\nThe earliest Jewish followers of Jesus (the [[Jewish Christians]]) understood him as the Son of Man in the Jewish sense, a human who, through his perfect obedience to God's will, was resurrected and [[Ascension of Jesus|exalted to heaven]] in readiness to return at any moment as the [[Son of Man]], the supernatural figure seen in [[Daniel 7]]:13\u201314, ushering in and ruling over the [[Kingdom of God]].{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=154\u2013155}} Paul has already moved away from this apocalyptic tradition towards a position where [[Christology]] and [[soteriology]] take precedence: Jesus is no longer the one who proclaims the message of the imminently coming Kingdom, he actually ''is'' the kingdom, the one in whom the kingdom of God is already present.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=156}}\n\nThis is also the message of Mark, a gentile writing for a church of gentile Christians, for whom Jesus as \"Son of God\" has become a divine being whose suffering, death and resurrection are essential to God's plan for redemption.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=155}} Matthew presents Jesus' appearance in Galilee ([[Matthew 28:16]]\u2013[[Matthew 28:17|17]]) as a Greco-Roman apotheosis, the human body transformed to make it fitting for paradise.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=149}} He goes beyond the ordinary Greco-Roman forms, however, by having Jesus claim \"all authority ... in heaven and on earth\" ([[Matthew 28:18|28:18]]) \u2013 a claim no Roman hero would dare make \u2013 while charging the apostles to bring the whole world into a divine community of righteousness and compassion.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=150}} Notable too is that the expectation of the imminent Second Coming has been delayed: it will still come about, but first the whole world must be gathered in.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=150}}\n\nIn Paul and the first three gospels, and also in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], Jesus is portrayed as having the highest status, but the Jewish commitment to  [[monotheism]] prevents the authors from depicting him as fully one with God.{{sfn|Chester|2016|p=15}} This stage was reached first in the Christian community which produced the [[Johannine literature]]: only here in the New Testament does Jesus become God incarnate, the body of the resurrected Jesus bringing [[Doubting Thomas]] to exclaim, \"My Lord and my God!\"{{sfn|Chester|2016|p=15\u201316}}{{sfn|Vermes|2001|p=unpaginated}}\n\n==Explanations==\n\n===Evolution of resurrection beliefs===\nThe appearances of Jesus are often explained as [[Vision theory of Jesus' appearances|visionary experiences]], in which the presence of Jesus was felt.{{sfn|De Conick|2006|p=6}}{{sfn|Koester|2000|p=64-65}}{{sfn|Vermes|2008b|p=141}}{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|p=73}}{{sfn|Leman2015|p=168-169}} According to Finney, a physical resurrection was unnecessary for the visionary mode of seeing the risen Christ, but when the gospels of Matthew, Luke and John were being written, the emphasis had shifted to the physical nature of the resurrection, while still overlapping with the earlier concept of a divine exaltation of Jesus' soul.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=181}} This development can be linked to the changing make-up of the Christian community: Paul and the earliest Christ-followers were Jewish, and [[Second Temple Judaism]] emphasised the life of the soul; the [[gospel]]-writers, in an overwhelmingly Greco-Roman church, stressed instead the pagan belief in the hero who is immortalised and [[deified]] in his physical body.{{sfn|Finney|2016|p=183}} {{Unreliable source|sure=y|reason=Finney appears to be doing fringe comparative religion of Christ-myth theorists. He believes the Christian community drue on a physical resurrection, though this is shown not be me the case in Mainstream scholarship.|date=February 2020}} However, critical New Testament scholar Gerd L\u00fcdemann states the earliest Christians believed in a bodily resurrection stating \"...we have no sound way to place the symbolic interpretation of Jesus' resurrection within the context of earliest Christian resurrection belief.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ludemann|first=Gerd|title=The Resurrection of Christ: A Historical Inquiry|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=180}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, New Testament scholar James Dunn argues that whereas the apostle Paul's resurrection experience was \"visionary in character\" and \"non-physical, non-material,\" the accounts in the Gospels and of the apostles mentioned by Paul are very different. He contends that the \"massive realism' [...] of the [Gospel] appearances themselves can only be described as visionary with great difficulty - and Luke would certainly reject the description as inappropriate,\" and that the earliest conception of resurrection in the Jerusalem Christian community was physical.<ref>James D.G.

Ehrman|Ehrman]], \"the disciples' belief in the resurrection was based on visionary experiences.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=98, 101}}{{NoteTag|[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman]] dismisses the story of the empty tomb; accoridng to Ehrman, \"an empty tomb had nothing to do with it [...] an empty tomb would not produce faith.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=98}}}} Ehrman notes that both Jesus and his early followers were apocalyptic Jews, who believed in the bodily resurrection, which would start when the coming of God's Kingdom was near.{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=99}} Ehrman further notes that visions usually have a strong persuasive power, but that the Gospel-accounts also record a tradition of doubt about the appearances of Jesus. Ehrman's \"tentative suggestion\" is that only a few followers had visions, including Peter, Paul and Mary. They told others about those visions, convincing most of their close associates that Jesus was raised from the dead, but not all of them. Eventually, these stories were retold and embellished, leading to the story that all disciples had seen the risen Jesus.{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=101-102}} The belief in Jesus' resurrection radically changed their perceptions, concluding from his absence that he must have been exalted to heaven, by God himself, exalting him to an unprecedented status and authority.{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=109-110}}\n\n====Call to missionary activity====\nAccording to [[Helmut Koester]], the stories of the resurrection were originally [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanies]] in which the disciples are called to a ministry by the risen Jesus, and at a secondary stage were interpreted as physical proof of the event. He contends that the more detailed accounts of the resurrection are also secondary and do not come from historically trustworthy sources, but instead belong to the genre of the narrative types.{{sfn|Koester|2000|p=64\u201365}}\n\nAccording to [[Gerd L\u00fcdemann]], Peter had a vision of Jesus, induced by his feelings of guilt of betraying Jesus. The vision elevated this feeling of guilt, and Peter experienced it as a real appearance of Jesus, raised from dead. He convinced the other disciples that the resurrection of Jesus signalled that the endtime was near and God's Kingdom was coming, when the dead who would rise again, as evidenced by Jesus.

It is the primary airport for West Palm Beach, [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], Wellington, [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], and the surrounding area. It is also one of three major airports serving the [[Miami metropolitan area]]. The airport is operated by [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]]'s Department of Airports. Road access to the airport is direct from [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]], [[Southern Boulevard (Palm Beach County, Florida)|Southern Boulevard]], and [[Florida State Road 807|Congress Avenue]]. The airport is bordered on the west by [[Florida State Road 809|Military Trail]].\n\n==History==\n:''For the military use of the Airport, see [[Palm Beach Air Force Base]]''\nPalm Beach International Airport began operations in 1936 as '''Morrison Field'''. Morrison Field was named in honor of [[Grace Morrison]], a key participant in the planning and organization of the airfield. The first flight departing the field was a New York bound [[Eastern Air Lines]] [[DC-2]] in 1936. The airport was dedicated on December 19, 1936.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url= http://www.pbia.org/about/history/|title=History - Palm Beach International Airport |website=www.pbia.org |access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1937 the airport expanded beyond an airstrip and an administration building when the Palm Beach Aero Corporation obtained a lease, built hangars and the first terminal on the south side of the airport. The new terminal was known as the Eastern Air Lines Terminal.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe field was used by the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] Morrison Field was used for training and later as a staging base for the Allied invasion of France, with numerous aircraft departing Morrison en route to the United Kingdom to take part in the [[D-Day]] invasion of Normandy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Morrison Field was a stopover for flights to and from India, via Brazil and West Africa.<ref name=pbcho>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbchistoryonline.org/page/us-military-in-west-palm-beach|title=U.S. Military in West Palm Beach|website=Palm Beach County History Online|access-date=November 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1947 the newly established [[U.S. Air Force]] returned Morrison Field to Palm Beach County. The name was changed to Palm Beach International Airport in 1948.<ref name=pbcho/>\n\nThe airport was again used by the [[U.S. Air Force]] in 1951 and renamed '''Palm Beach Air Force Base''',<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\">[[Palm Beach Air Force Base]]</ref> under the control of the [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS). USAF operations occupied the north half of the airfield while civil operations and the airline terminal used the south half. MATS used the base for training with the host unit being the 1707th Air Transport Wing (Heavy), and its 1740th Heavy Transport Training Unit. The 1707 ATW was known as the \"University of MATS\", becoming the primary USAF training unit for all Air Force personnel supporting and flying heavy transport aircraft. These included [[C-124 Globemaster II]], [[C-118 Liftmaster]], [[C-97 Stratofreighter]], and [[C-54 Skymaster]] maintenance training along with aircrew and transition pilot training. Nearly 23,000 airmen trained at Palm Beach AFB during the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Air Weather Service]] used Palm Beach AFB as headquarters for hurricane research, flying the first [[B-50 Superfortress|WB-50D Superfortress]] \"Hurricane Hunter\" aircraft from the base in 1956.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter several years of Palm Beach County fighting the Air Force presence in West Palm Beach, the Air Force started to close down operations there. The 1707 ATW was inactivated on June 30, 1959 and reassigned to [[Tinker AFB]], Oklahoma. With the wing's departure, Palm Beach County took over airfield operations. The Air Force retained a small presence at the base with the 9th Weather Group becoming the main operational unit at Palm Beach AFB, performing hurricane and weather research for the Air Weather Service. The Air Photographic and Charting Service (APCS) moved its 1370th Photo-Mapping Wing to the base, performing geodetic survey flights. The Air Force finally closed Palm Beach AFB in 1962 and all property was conveyed to Palm Beach International Airport the same year.<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\"/>\n\n[[Delta Air Lines]] began scheduled flights in 1959 and [[Capital Airlines (United States)|Capital Airlines]] in 1960. The first turbine-powered flights were Eastern Airlines [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]]s in 1959, and Eastern DC-8 nonstops to Idlewild started in December 1960.\n\n[[Air Force One]] was a frequent visitor to PBI during [[John F. Kennedy]]'s presidency in the early 1960s. Local voters defeated a proposal to relocate the airport around this time, instead choosing to expand the existing facilities. In October 1966 an eight-gate Main Terminal opened on the northeast side of the airport; in 1974 [[Delta Air Lines]] moved into its own six-gate terminal with the airport's first jetways.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) built a new Air Traffic Control Tower on the south side of the airport in this period.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the airport's dominant carriers were [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], [[Eastern Air Lines|Eastern]] and [[National Airlines (1934\u20131980)|National]]. Eastern operated the airport's only widebody service at the time, daily L-1011s to [[John F.

In that year a new landscaped [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] interchange was built to decrease traffic on Southern Boulevard ([[U.S. Route 98 in Florida|US 98]]) extending Turnage Boulevard (the road around the perimeter of the concourse).\n\nCompetition from rapidly expanding Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport cut growth at the airport in the 1990s. The 2001 recession and the September 11 terrorist attacks further inhibited growth, but development in South Florida since 2002 has finally led to a surge of passenger traffic at the airport. In addition, discount carriers such as [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines]] began service to PBI. In 2006 the county embarked on an interim expansion program by breaking ground on a 7-story parking garage and the addition of 3 gates in Concourse C. Long range expansions include gates at Concourse B and the eventual construction of a new 14 gate Concourse D to be extended east from the present terminal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nFollowing the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]], Air Force One again became a frequent visitor to PBI, typically parking on the south side of the airport near Southern Boulevard while Trump visited his nearby [[Mar-a-Lago]] estate. Until 2017, a line of [[School bus|school buses]] was used as a temporary barrier between the aircraft and onlookers. Palm Beach County stated that it would erect a more permanent barrier system in mid-2017, but the school buses were still in use as of November.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/local/new-trump-finally-gets-wall-shield-air-force-one-pbia/rJJaNv4tZltm6Y8TnrmdzH/ |title=NEW: Trump finally gets wall \u2014 to shield Air Force One at PBIA|last=Webb|first=Kristina|work=The Palm Beach Post|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wall-of-buses-ready-at-palm-beach-airport-in-anticipation-of-trump-visit-for-thanksgiving|title=Wall of buses ready at Palm Beach airport in anticipation of Trump visit for Thanksgiving|date=2017-11-19|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n{{wide image|KPBI PBIA Panoramic.jpg|1600px|align-cap=center|''A panorama of Palm Beach International Airport from what was the 391st Bomb Group Restaurant off of [[Southern Boulevard (Palm Beach County, Florida)|Southern Boulevard]].''}}Palm Beach International Airport covers {{convert|2120|acre|ha|0}} and has three runways:<ref name=FAA />\n* 10L-28R: 10,001 x 150&nbsp;ft.

Ground traffic controllers, and approach controllers whose sector is within {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of the runway would have remained at PBIA. The FAA cited the move as a cost-cutting measure, but critics say that it creates a risk to South Florida air traffic if the Miami facility is damaged in a hurricane, or terrorist attack. The [[National Air Traffic Controllers Association]] opposed the move. The remote facility at Miami International Airport houses air traffic controllers for Miami and Fort Lauderdale international airports.\n\n[[Donald Trump]] sued to block the expansion of one of the runways at PBIA in 2010.<ref>Playford, Adam.

It is the primary airport for West Palm Beach, [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], Wellington, [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], and the surrounding area. It is also one of three major airports serving the [[Miami metropolitan area]]. The airport is operated by [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]]'s Department of Airports. Road access to the airport is direct from [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]], [[Southern Boulevard (Palm Beach County, Florida)|Southern Boulevard]], and [[Florida State Road 807|Congress Avenue]]. The airport is bordered on the west by [[Florida State Road 809|Military Trail]].\n\n==History==\n:''For the military use of the Airport, see [[Palm Beach Air Force Base]]''\nPalm Beach International Airport began operations in 1936 as '''Morrison Field'''. Morrison Field was named in honor of [[Grace Morrison]], a key participant in the planning and organization of the airfield. The first flight departing the field was a New York bound [[Eastern Air Lines]] [[DC-2]] in 1936. The airport was dedicated on December 19, 1936.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url= http://www.pbia.org/about/history/|title=History - Palm Beach International Airport |website=www.pbia.org |access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1937 the airport expanded beyond an airstrip and an administration building when the Palm Beach Aero Corporation obtained a lease, built hangars and the first terminal on the south side of the airport. The new terminal was known as the Eastern Air Lines Terminal.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe field was used by the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] Morrison Field was used for training and later as a staging base for the Allied invasion of France, with numerous aircraft departing Morrison en route to the United Kingdom to take part in the [[D-Day]] invasion of Normandy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Morrison Field was a stopover for flights to and from India, via Brazil and West Africa.<ref name=pbcho>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbchistoryonline.org/page/us-military-in-west-palm-beach|title=U.S. Military in West Palm Beach|website=Palm Beach County History Online|access-date=November 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1947 the newly established [[U.S. Air Force]] returned Morrison Field to Palm Beach County. The name was changed to Palm Beach International Airport in 1948.<ref name=pbcho/>\n\nThe airport was again used by the [[U.S. Air Force]] in 1951 and renamed '''Palm Beach Air Force Base''',<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\">[[Palm Beach Air Force Base]]</ref> under the control of the [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS). USAF operations occupied the north half of the airfield while civil operations and the airline terminal used the south half. MATS used the base for training with the host unit being the 1707th Air Transport Wing (Heavy), and its 1740th Heavy Transport Training Unit. The 1707 ATW was known as the \"University of MATS\", becoming the primary USAF training unit for all Air Force personnel supporting and flying heavy transport aircraft. These included [[C-124 Globemaster II]], [[C-118 Liftmaster]], [[C-97 Stratofreighter]], and [[C-54 Skymaster]] maintenance training along with aircrew and transition pilot training. Nearly 23,000 airmen trained at Palm Beach AFB during the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Air Weather Service]] used Palm Beach AFB as headquarters for hurricane research, flying the first [[B-50 Superfortress|WB-50D Superfortress]] \"Hurricane Hunter\" aircraft from the base in 1956.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter several years of Palm Beach County fighting the Air Force presence in West Palm Beach, the Air Force started to close down operations there. The 1707 ATW was inactivated on June 30, 1959 and reassigned to [[Tinker AFB]], Oklahoma. With the wing's departure, Palm Beach County took over airfield operations. The Air Force retained a small presence at the base with the 9th Weather Group becoming the main operational unit at Palm Beach AFB, performing hurricane and weather research for the Air Weather Service. The Air Photographic and Charting Service (APCS) moved its 1370th Photo-Mapping Wing to the base, performing geodetic survey flights. The Air Force finally closed Palm Beach AFB in 1962 and all property was conveyed to Palm Beach International Airport the same year.<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\"/>\n\n[[Delta Air Lines]] began scheduled flights in 1959 and [[Capital Airlines (United States)|Capital Airlines]] in 1960. The first turbine-powered flights were Eastern Airlines [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]]s in 1959, and Eastern DC-8 nonstops to Idlewild started in December 1960.\n\n[[Air Force One]] was a frequent visitor to PBI during [[John F. Kennedy]]'s presidency in the early 1960s. Local voters defeated a proposal to relocate the airport around this time, instead choosing to expand the existing facilities. In October 1966 an eight-gate Main Terminal opened on the northeast side of the airport; in 1974 [[Delta Air Lines]] moved into its own six-gate terminal with the airport's first jetways.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) built a new Air Traffic Control Tower on the south side of the airport in this period.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the airport's dominant carriers were [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], [[Eastern Air Lines|Eastern]] and [[National Airlines (1934\u20131980)|National]]. Eastern operated the airport's only widebody service at the time, daily L-1011s to [[John F.

In that year a new landscaped [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] interchange was built to decrease traffic on Southern Boulevard ([[U.S. Route 98 in Florida|US 98]]) extending Turnage Boulevard (the road around the perimeter of the concourse).\n\nCompetition from rapidly expanding Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport cut growth at the airport in the 1990s. The 2001 recession and the September 11 terrorist attacks further inhibited growth, but development in South Florida since 2002 has finally led to a surge of passenger traffic at the airport. In addition, discount carriers such as [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines]] began service to PBI. In 2006 the county embarked on an interim expansion program by breaking ground on a 7-story parking garage and the addition of 3 gates in Concourse C. Long range expansions include gates at Concourse B and the eventual construction of a new 14 gate Concourse D to be extended east from the present terminal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nFollowing the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]], Air Force One again became a frequent visitor to PBI, typically parking on the south side of the airport near Southern Boulevard while Trump visited his nearby [[Mar-a-Lago]] estate. Until 2017, a line of [[School bus|school buses]] was used as a temporary barrier between the aircraft and onlookers. Palm Beach County stated that it would erect a more permanent barrier system in mid-2017, but the school buses were still in use as of November.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/local/new-trump-finally-gets-wall-shield-air-force-one-pbia/rJJaNv4tZltm6Y8TnrmdzH/ |title=NEW: Trump finally gets wall \u2014 to shield Air Force One at PBIA|last=Webb|first=Kristina|work=The Palm Beach Post|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wall-of-buses-ready-at-palm-beach-airport-in-anticipation-of-trump-visit-for-thanksgiving|title=Wall of buses ready at Palm Beach airport in anticipation of Trump visit for Thanksgiving|date=2017-11-19|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n{{wide image|KPBI PBIA Panoramic.jpg|1600px|align-cap=center|''A panorama of Palm Beach International Airport from what was the 391st Bomb Group Restaurant off of [[Southern Boulevard (Palm Beach County, Florida)|Southern Boulevard]].''}}Palm Beach International Airport covers {{convert|2120|acre|ha|0}} and has three runways:<ref name=FAA />\n* 10L-28R: 10,001 x 150&nbsp;ft.

Ground traffic controllers, and approach controllers whose sector is within {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of the runway would have remained at PBIA. The FAA cited the move as a cost-cutting measure, but critics say that it creates a risk to South Florida air traffic if the Miami facility is damaged in a hurricane, or terrorist attack. The [[National Air Traffic Controllers Association]] opposed the move. The remote facility at Miami International Airport houses air traffic controllers for Miami and Fort Lauderdale international airports.\n\n[[Donald Trump]] sued to block the expansion of one of the runways at PBIA in 2010.<ref>Playford, Adam.

The game emphasises on commanding a group of six [[AH-64 Apache]] crews of the [[US Army]] in battles against the [[Communist]] [[FARC]] [[Insurgency|insurgents]] in [[Colombia]] and the [[Russian military]] in [[Latvia]].\n\n''Team Apache'' was at first developed by Simis under [[Eidos Interactive]]. When Simis' two lead developers, [[Jonathan Newth]] and Ian Baverstock bought the company back from Eidos, they became an independent development team once more and Mindscape purchased the publishing rights of the game.\n\n== Flight modelling ==\n\nThe [[cockpit]], [[sensor]] and flight modelling aspects of the game are a lot simpler than those of the ''[[Comanche (video game series)|Comanche series]]'' and the ''[[Longbow (computer game)|Longbow]]'' flight simulators. Cockpit [[Rendering (computer graphics)|renders]] are not very advanced, and instruments are difficult to read. This applies to the rendered cockpit and the floating cockpit. The clear cockpit view is the easiest to use, but there are no sensor overlays. The gunner selects the targets most of the time, and players have reported some issues with his/her [[AI]]. [[Electronic countermeasures|ECM]], [[radars]] and [[lasers]] cannot be toggled on or off. The flight modelling is not the most accurate on the helicopter sim market. For example, unwise maneuvres that warrant a crash can be performed without a hitch. In addition, hovering is a lot simpler than in the ''Comanche'' and ''Longbow'' games.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nTeam Apache is a different breed of helicopter flight simulator. Unlike most flight sims, Team Apache focuses less on the realism of flight and weapons systems modelling, and more on the gameplay aspects - consisting of command, tactics and battlefield realism.\n\nTeam Apache is unique among simulations in that it gives the player unparalleled control over his/her combat unit. The player is not just flying missions- he is also managing the morale of his/her men, supply and maintenance, and the tactical planning that takes place before the mission. Although the player's control over these factors is rather basic, few, if any, simulations have as much depth as Team Apache. The geopolitical causes of Team Apache's wars, related in both the game's manual and the \"daily\" newspaper, are both sophisticated and plausible. Detailed military-style SITREPs create a thorough picture of the tactical situation, and ground forces can be seen in the game fighting each other all throughout the theater using fairly realistic deployments and movements. These details provided by the game, combined with the player's control over his/her men and his/her equipment, make Team Apache one of the most immersive combat simulations ever published in some player's opinions.\n\nPerhaps the biggest drawback of the game is the lack of time compression. During the Colombian campaign missions are short, lasting less than 15 minutes in most cases, but the Latvian campaign missions may involve travelling more than 100 kilometers round-trip. The player may turn on autopilot during these long transit periods but must still stay alert for enemy contact. Depending on your point of view, this either increases the immersion experience or wastes time. Players should not be concerned about playing the same long mission over and over again, though, because the campaigns, although linear, can be played by accepting your defeats and team's casualties and moving on to the next mission.\n\nAn interesting fact is that in the Colombian campaign you can fly the other direction overseas and may get captured by intercepter planes from another country which even warn you to not fly further or you will be shot down.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe storyline in ''Team Apache'' is highly developed. It develops through [[Full motion video|FMV]] sequences, in mission briefings and newspaper articles.\n\n=== Colombian Campaign ===\n\nIn 1998, the [[Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia]]\u2013Ej\u00e9rcito del Pueblo or FARC-EP (Spanish for \"Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia\u2013People's Army\") has staged a large-scale [[guerrilla]] offensive against the [[government of Colombia]]. In its wake comes a wave of [[kidnappings]] and [[assassinations]] of high-ranking officials and their families. The corrupt and inefficient [[military of Colombia]] and police cannot hold their own against the [[Insurgency|insurgents]], and need help from the [[United States]]. The United States needs to safeguard Colombia's oil industry and eliminate FARC's illegal [[cocaine]] industry.\n\n=== Latvian Campaign ===\n\n== Modes of play ==\n\n''Team Apache'' contains a host of play modes, including a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode and a mission building application.\n\n=== Training ===\n\nThe Training missions give players the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the mechanics of flying the Apache helicopter. They are instructed by an artificial, gruff flight officer, one pilot McNabbit. While the learning curve in the actual game takes no more than two hours, the training missions are extremely rigid, and each instruction must be performed to precision.\n\n=== Instant Action ===\n\nThis mode instantly plunges the player into arcade-style combat. The player has no team to command or get support from, and there is no mission structure. The objective is to simply engage and destroy as many enemy vehicles and troops as the player can around a circular course that leads back to the base each time.\n\n=== Combat Missions ===\n\nThe Combat Missions are a series of realistic, structured missions during which the player takes command of a team of Apaches. They are much like the Campaign missions themselves, but they are independent of one another and can be repeated upon completion. These are the following mission types:\n\n'''Air to Air'''\n\nIn the Colombian scenario, the player must lead the company to hunt down FARC 500MD Defender light helicopters. In the Latvian version, a large group of [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant|Mil]] [[Mi-24]], [[Mi-28]] and [[Ka-50]] attack helicopters are approaching to destroy the Apache company's base.\n\n'''Deep Strike'''\n\n'''Route [[Recon (role-playing game)|Recon]]'''\n\n'''[[Search and Rescue]]'''\n\n'''Search and Destroy'''\n\n'''[[Suppression of Enemy Air Defences]] (SEAD)'''\n\nWhile there are different mission types, the objective remains the same for each. However, the weather, the time of day, the location of the mission, the number of Apaches accompanying the player, and the difficulty can be adjusted. The player begins the mission on the ground, takes off, and follows a route dotted with Aerial Check Point (ACP) destinations to find and eliminate the target or rendezvous with an ally and achieve the objective. Auto-pilot can be activated to easily navigate and find the APCs.\n\n=== Campaign ===\n\nThis mode allows the player to take control of a company of six Apache helicopters - plus a spare. Under the player's command are eight [[aircraft pilot|pilots]], eight [[co-pilot]]/[[infantry support weapon|gunners]], and sixteen crew chief personnel. The player can choose a name with limited characters, and can also select the division and company the team will belong to:\n\n'''Army Attack Helicopter Units'''\n\n* [[82nd Airborne Division]]\n* [[101st Airborne Division]]\n* [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]]\n* [[1st Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment (United States)|227th Aviation Regiment]]\n\n'''Company'''\n\nThe player can roam around a pre-rendered army base, and enter a building by highlighting the title above it and clicking it. The areas that can be accessed include the repair hangar, the pilot's barracks, the briefing room, the commander's quarters, and the landing strip to start the mission.\n\nThe pilots under your command are realistic, and each has a rich background well described in their biographies. However, their catchphrases are not so convincing. The player will need to weigh their strong points against their weaknesses, and from their assessment select the best pilots for the team.\n\nThe damage report tells the commander what parts need to be repaired, and can judge how many crew chiefs will be needed to make the repairs in time for the next mission. The player can tell them whether to load [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] [[missiles]] or [[Hydra 70]] [[rocket]]s.\n\n=== Mission builder ===\n\nTeam Apache comes with a fairly simple mission creator utility. The user is allowed to set the takeoff and landing points of his/her helicopter unit and place enemy and friendly ground units. It's possible to give initial orders to ground units, but no sea units can be placed, and the only air units other than the player's helicopters that can be placed are enemy helicopter flights, which hover over their location and can't be given orders in the mission creator.\n\nThe user then sets point values for the Major Defeat, Defeat, Draw, Victory, and Decisive Victory win levels. He or she can adjust the default weapons load for the mission and can set a briefing. The user saves the mission and opens it in the game in the \"Combat Mission\" screen, where he can then adjust the mission's weather, time, difficulty, and the number of aircraft in his flight each time he plays.\n\nThe mission creator is not full-feature and does not have all of the functions present in the missions that come with the game.\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\n\n== Other forces ==\n\n=== Friendly forces ===\n\nThe player cannot communicate with ground or air units outside his wing, but he can request reinforcements and artillery strikes. Many friendly ground and air forces are present in each mission.\n\nFriendly units include:\n\n'''Aircraft'''\n\n* [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] [[Close Air Support]]\n* [[F-15 Eagle]] tactical fighters\n* [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] multi-role fighters\n* [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] transport helicopters\n\n=== Enemy forces ===\n\nThere are two main adversaries Team Apache will face. The first is that of the FARC. These are the equipment they use in the Colombian Campaign:\n\n'''Aircraft'''\n\n* [[McDonnell Douglas]] 500MD Defender II light gunship and multi-role helicopter\n* [[Cessna]] drug-transport aircraft\n\n'''Ground units'''\n\n* Hand-held [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]]\n* Infantry\n* [[EE-9]] and [[EE-11]] scout vehicles captured from the Colombian army\n\nThe Russian forces have the following equipment:\n\n'''Aircraft'''\n\n* MiG-27 'Flogger-J' [[ground attack]] fighter\n* Mil Mi-8 'Hip' transport helicopter\n* Mil Mi-24 'Hind' heavy gunship helicopter\n* Mil Mi-28 'Havoc' attack helicopter\n\n'''Air Defense'''\n\n* [[ZSU-23-4]] Shilka mobile gun\n* [[2S6 Tunguska]] SAM/AAA vehicle\n* [[SA-3]], [[SA-6]], [[SA-8]], [[SA-9]], [[SA-11]], [[SA-12]] and [[SA-13]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAMs]]\n\n'''Armored Fighting Vehicles''''\n\n* [[T-62]], [[T-72]] and [[T-80]] tanks\n* [[BMP-1]], [[BMP-2]], and [[BTR-80]] armored personnel carriers\n\n'''Ships'''\n\n* Cruiser\n* Patrol boat\n\n== Comparable games ==\n\n* ''Ka-52 Team Alligator'' - the 'sequel' to Team Apache, developed by Simis.\n* ''[[Comanche (video game series)|Comanche series]]''\n*\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30m}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061020183655/http://www.combatsim.com/memb123/archive/htm/htm_arc4/team_int.htm Combatsim.com Team Apache interview] A site dedicated to combat simulations, with an interview with Bryan Walker, the original concept developer for Team Apache.\n* [http://www.gamespot.com/pc/sim/teamapache/review.html Gamespot review]\n*{{moby game|id=/team-apache}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908002601/http://www.migman.com/ref/1990_combat/TApache/TApache.htm Migman's Team Apache info]\n\n[[Category:1998 video games]]\n[[Category:Simis games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2019}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title = Team Apache\n|image = Team Apache Coverart.png\n|developer = [[Simis]]\n|publisher = [[Mindscape Group]]<br>[[Strategic Simulations|SSI]]\n|released = June 24, 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogr.com/news/news0698.html|title=News for June 24, 1998|date=June 24, 1998|website=Online Gaming Review|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001204141700/http://www.ogr.com/news/news0698.html|archive-date=December 4, 2000|url-status=dead|access-date=December 6, 2019}}<br>\"'''June 24, 1998:''' \"Some new games have been spotted in stores: ...Team Apache from SSI.\"</ref>\n|genre = [[Flight simulator]]\n|modes = [[Single player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n|platforms = [[Microsoft Windows]]\n}}\n\n'''Team Apache''' is an [[attack helicopter]] [[flight simulator]] developed by [[Simis]] and published by [[Mindscape Group]].

The objective is to simply engage and destroy as many enemy vehicles and troops as the player can around a circular course that leads back to the base each time.\n\n=== Combat Missions ===\n\nThe Combat Missions are a series of realistic, structured missions during which the player takes command of a team of Apaches. They are much like the Campaign missions themselves, but they are independent of one another and can be repeated upon completion. These are the following mission types:\n\n'''Air to Air'''\n\nIn the Colombian scenario, the player must lead the company to hunt down FARC 500MD Defender light helicopters. In the Latvian version, a large group of [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant|Mil]] [[Mi-24]], [[Mi-28]] and [[Ka-50]] attack helicopters are approaching to destroy the Apache company's base.\n\n'''Deep Strike'''\n\n'''Route [[Recon (role-playing game)|Recon]]'''\n\n'''[[Search and Rescue]]'''\n\n'''Search and Destroy'''\n\n'''[[Suppression of Enemy Air Defences]] (SEAD)'''\n\nWhile there are different mission types, the objective remains the same for each. However, the weather, the time of day, the location of the mission, the number of Apaches accompanying the player, and the difficulty can be adjusted. The player begins the mission on the ground, takes off, and follows a route dotted with Aerial Check Point (ACP) destinations to find and eliminate the target or rendezvous with an ally and achieve the objective. Auto-pilot can be activated to easily navigate and find the APCs.\n\n=== Campaign ===\n\nThis mode allows the player to take control of a company of six Apache helicopters - plus a spare. Under the player's command are eight [[aircraft pilot|pilots]], eight [[co-pilot]]/[[infantry support weapon|gunners]], and sixteen crew chief personnel. The player can choose a name with limited characters, and can also select the division and company the team will belong to:\n\n'''Army Attack Helicopter Units'''\n\n* [[82nd Airborne Division]]\n* [[101st Airborne Division]]\n* [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]]\n* [[1st Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment (United States)|227th Aviation Regiment]]\n\n'''Company'''\n\nThe player can roam around a pre-rendered army base, and enter a building by highlighting the title above it and clicking it. The areas that can be accessed include the repair hangar, the pilot's barracks, the briefing room, the commander's quarters, and the landing strip to start the mission.\n\nThe pilots under your command are realistic, and each has a rich background well described in their biographies. However, their catchphrases are not so convincing. The player will need to weigh their strong points against their weaknesses, and from their assessment select the best pilots for the team.\n\nThe damage report tells the commander what parts need to be repaired, and can judge how many crew chiefs will be needed to make the repairs in time for the next mission. The player can tell them whether to load [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] [[missiles]] or [[Hydra 70]] [[rocket]]s.\n\n=== Mission builder ===\n\nTeam Apache comes with a fairly simple mission creator utility. The user is allowed to set the takeoff and landing points of his/her helicopter unit and place enemy and friendly ground units. It's possible to give initial orders to ground units, but no sea units can be placed, and the only air units other than the player's helicopters that can be placed are enemy helicopter flights, which hover over their location and can't be given orders in the mission creator.\n\nThe user then sets point values for the Major Defeat, Defeat, Draw, Victory, and Decisive Victory win levels. He or she can adjust the default weapons load for the mission and can set a briefing. The user saves the mission and opens it in the game in the \"Combat Mission\" screen, where he can then adjust the mission's weather, time, difficulty, and the number of aircraft in his flight each time he plays.\n\nThe mission creator is not full-feature and does not have all of the functions present in the missions that come with the game.\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\n\n== Other forces ==\n\n=== Friendly forces ===\n\nThe player cannot communicate with ground or air units outside his wing, but he can request reinforcements and artillery strikes. Many friendly ground and air forces are present in each mission.\n\nFriendly units include:\n\n'''Aircraft'''\n\n* [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] [[Close Air Support]]\n* [[F-15 Eagle]] tactical fighters\n* [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] multi-role fighters\n* [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] transport helicopters\n\n=== Enemy forces ===\n\nThere are two main adversaries Team Apache will face. The first is that of the FARC. These are the equipment they use in the Colombian Campaign:\n\n'''Aircraft'''\n\n* [[McDonnell Douglas]] 500MD Defender II light gunship and multi-role helicopter\n* [[Cessna]] drug-transport aircraft\n\n'''Ground units'''\n\n* Hand-held [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]]\n* Infantry\n* [[EE-9]] and [[EE-11]] scout vehicles captured from the Columbian army\n\nThe Russian forces have the following equipment:\n\n'''Aircraft'''\n\n* MiG-27 'Flogger-J' [[ground attack]] fighter\n* Mil Mi-8 'Hip' transport helicopter\n* Mil Mi-24 'Hind' heavy gunship helicopter\n* Mil Mi-28 'Havoc' attack helicopter\n\n'''Air Defense'''\n\n* [[ZSU-23-4]] Shilka mobile gun\n* [[2S6 Tunguska]] SAM/AAA vehicle\n* [[SA-3]], [[SA-6]], [[SA-8]], [[SA-9]], [[SA-11]], [[SA-12]] and [[SA-13]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAMs]]\n\n'''Armored Fighting Vehicles''''\n\n* [[T-62]], [[T-72]] and [[T-80]] tanks\n* [[BMP-1]], [[BMP-2]], and [[BTR-80]] armored personnel carriers\n\n'''Ships'''\n\n* Cruiser\n* Patrol boat\n\n== Comparable games ==\n\n* ''Ka-52 Team Alligator'' - the 'sequel' to Team Apache, developed by Simis.\n* ''[[Comanche (video game series)|Comanche series]]''\n*\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30m}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061020183655/http://www.combatsim.com/memb123/archive/htm/htm_arc4/team_int.htm Combatsim.com Team Apache interview] A site dedicated to combat simulations, with an interview with Bryan Walker, the original concept developer for Team Apache.\n* [http://www.gamespot.com/pc/sim/teamapache/review.html Gamespot review]\n*{{moby game|id=/team-apache}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908002601/http://www.migman.com/ref/1990_combat/TApache/TApache.htm Migman's Team Apache info]\n\n[[Category:1998 video games]]\n[[Category:Simis games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n", "name_user": "PohranicniStraze", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Apache"}
