Preschool, which targets children from age three to five, is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to Standard One (First Grade). At the end of primary education, pupils sit the [[Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]] (KCPE), which determines those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training. The result of this examination is needed for placement at secondary school.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPrimary school is for students aged 6/7-13/14 years.

However, English, Kiswahili, and mathematics are compulsory subjects.\n\nThe Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS), formerly the Joint Admissions Board (JAB), is responsible for selecting students joining the public universities. Other than the public schools, there are many private schools, mainly in urban areas. Similarly, there are a number of [[international school]]s catering to various overseas educational systems.\n\nDespite its impressive commercial approach and interests in the country, Kenya's [[academia]] and higher education system is notoriously rigid and disconnected from the needs of the local labour market and is widely blamed for the high number of unemployable and \"half-baked\" university graduates who struggle to fit in the modern workplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/news/Varsity-expansion-blamed-for-half-baked-graduates/539546-3354256-108r90o/index.html|title=Varsity expansion blamed for half-baked graduates}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Kenya}}\n[[File:Kenyan dancers.jpg|thumb|Kenyan boys and girls performing a traditional dance]]\n[[File:Nation media house.jpg|thumb|Nation Media House, which hosts the [[Nation Media Group]]]]\n\nThe [[culture of Kenya]] consists of multiple traditions.

It instead consists of the various cultures of the country's different communities.\n\nNotable populations include the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] on the coast, several other [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] communities in the central and western regions, and Nilotic communities in the northwest. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]] culture is well known to tourism, despite constituting a relatively small part of Kenya's population. They are renowned for their elaborate upper-body adornment and jewellery.\n\nAdditionally, Kenya has an extensive music, television, and theatre scene.\n\n===Media===\n{{Further|Media of Kenya}}\nKenya has a number of media outlets that broadcast domestically and globally.

His novel, ''[[Weep Not, Child]]'', is an illustration of life in Kenya during the British occupation. The story details the effects of the Mau Mau on the lives of Kenyans. Its combination of themes\u2014[[colonialism]], education, and love\u2014helped to make it one of the best-known novels in Africa.\n\n[[M.G. Vassanji]]'s 2003 novel ''The In-Between World of Vikram Lall'' won the [[Scotiabank Giller Prize|Giller Prize]] in 2003. It is the fictional memoir of a Kenyan of Indian heritage and his family as they adjust to the changing political climates in colonial and post-colonial Kenya.\n\nSince 2003, the literary journal ''[[Kwani?]]'' has been publishing Kenyan contemporary literature. Additionally, Kenya has also been nurturing emerging versatile authors such as Paul Kipchumba (Kipwendui, Kibiwott) who demonstrate a pan-African outlook (see ''Africa in China's 21st Century: In Search of a Strategy'' (2017).<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa in China's 21st Century: In Search of a Strategy|publisher= Independently published |date=3 December 2017|isbn = 978-1973456803}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Kenya}}\n[[File:Juacali 2.jpg|thumb|Popular Kenyan musician [[Jua Cali]].]]\n\nKenya has a diverse assortment of popular music forms, in addition to multiple types of [[folk music]] based on the variety of over 40 regional languages.<ref>[http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2007/04/article_0001.html On the Beat \u2013 Tapping the Potential of Kenya's Music Industry], [[WIPO]] Magazine (July 2007).</ref>\n\nDrums are the most dominant [[musical instrument|instrument]] in popular Kenyan music. Drum beats are very complex and include both native rhythms and imported ones, especially the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] [[cavacha]] rhythm. Popular Kenyan music usually involves the interplay of multiple parts, and more recently, showy guitar solos as well. There are also a number of local hip-hop artists, including [[Jua Cali]]; Afro-pop bands such as [[Sauti Sol]]; and musicians who play local genres like Benga, such as [[Akothee]].\n\nLyrics are most often in Kiswahili or English. There is also some emerging aspect of [[Lingala language|Lingala]] borrowed from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] musicians. Lyrics are also written in local languages. Urban radio generally only plays English music, though there also exist a number of vernacular radio stations.\n\nZilizopendwa is a genre of local urban music that was recorded in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s by musicians such as [[Daudi Kabaka]], [[Fadhili William]], and Sukuma Bin Ongaro, and is particularly enjoyed by older people\u2014having been popularised by the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation's Kiswahili service (formerly called Voice of Kenya or VOK).\n\nThe Isukuti is a vigorous dance performed by the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] sub-tribes to the beat of a traditional drum called the Isukuti during many occasions such as the birth of a child, marriage, or funeral. Other traditional dances include the [[Ohangla]] among the [[Luo peoples|Luo]], [[Nzele]] among the [[Mijikenda peoples|Mijikenda]], [[Mugithi]] among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], and [[Taarab]] among the [[Swahili people|Swahili]].\n\nAdditionally, Kenya has a growing Christian gospel music scene. Prominent local gospel musicians include the [[Kenyan Boys Choir]].\n\n[[Benga music]] has been popular since the late 1960s, especially in the area around [[Lake Victoria]]. The word ''benga'' is occasionally used to refer to any kind of pop music. Bass, guitar, and percussion are the usual instruments.\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Kenya}}\n[[File:2012 Olympics - Womens 5000m start 4.jpg|thumb|left|Jepkosgei Kipyego and Jepkemoi Cheruiyot at the 2012 London Olympics]]\n\nKenya is active in several sports, among them [[cricket]], [[rallying]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby union|rugby]], [[field hockey]], and [[boxing]]. The country is known chiefly for its dominance in [[middle-distance running|middle-distance]] and [[long-distance running|long-distance]] athletics, having consistently produced [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] champions in various distance events, especially in 800&nbsp;m, 1,500&nbsp;m, 3,000&nbsp;m steeplechase, 5,000&nbsp;m, 10,000&nbsp;m, and the marathon. Kenyan athletes (particularly [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]), continue to dominate the world of distance running, although competition from [[Morocco]] and [[Ethiopia]] has reduced this supremacy. Kenya's best-known athletes include the four-time women's [[Boston Marathon]] winner and two-time world champion [[Catherine Ndereba]], 800m world record holder [[David Rudisha]], former [[Marathon (sport)|marathon]] world record-holder [[Paul Tergat]], and [[John Ngugi]].\n\nKenya won several medals during the Beijing Olympics: six gold, four silver, and four bronze, making it Africa's most successful nation in the 2008 Olympics. New athletes gained attention, such as [[Pamela Jelimo]], the women's 800m gold medalist who went on to win the [[IAAF Golden League]] jackpot, and [[Samuel Wanjiru]], who won the men's marathon. Retired Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion [[Kipchoge Keino]] helped usher in Kenya's ongoing distance dynasty in the 1970s and was followed by Commonwealth Champion [[Henry Rono]]'s spectacular string of world record performances.

In 2005, agriculture, including [[forestry]] and fishing, accounted for 24% of GDP, as well as for 18% of wage employment and 50% of revenue from exports. The principal [[cash crop]]s are tea, horticultural produce, and coffee. Horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the two most valuable of all of Kenya's exports. The production of major food staples such as [[Maize|corn]] is subject to sharp weather-related fluctuations. Production downturns periodically necessitate food aid\u2014for example in 2004, due to one of Kenya's intermittent [[droughts]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wfp.org/news/news-release/drought-leaves-two-million-kenyans-need-food-aid | title=Drought leaves two million Kenyans in need of food aid | work=United Nations World Food Programme | date=26 April 2005 | accessdate=5 August 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814052428/http://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/drought-leaves-two-million-kenyans-need-food-aid | archive-date=14 August 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA consortium led by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) has had some success in helping farmers grow new [[pigeon pea]] varieties instead of maize, in particularly dry areas. Pigeon peas are very drought-resistant, so can be grown in areas with less than 650&nbsp;mm annual rainfall. Successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing. This work, which included linking producers to wholesalers, helped to increase local producer prices by 20\u201325% in Nairobi and Mombasa. The commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock, and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty.<ref>[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 Pigeonpea in Eastern and Southern Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718193632/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 |date=18 July 2014 }}.

Additionally, Kenya has also been nurturing emerging versatile authors such as Paul Kipchumba (Kipwendui, Kibiwott) who demonstrate a pan-African outlook (see ''Africa in China's 21st Century: In Search of a Strategy'' (2017).<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa in China's 21st Century: In Search of a Strategy|publisher= Independently published |date=3 December 2017|isbn = 978-1973456803}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Kenya}}\n[[File:Juacali 2.jpg|thumb|Popular Kenyan musician [[Jua Cali]].]]\n\nKenya has a diverse assortment of popular music forms, in addition to multiple types of [[folk music]] based on the variety of over 40 regional languages.<ref>[http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2007/04/article_0001.html On the Beat \u2013 Tapping the Potential of Kenya's Music Industry], [[WIPO]] Magazine (July 2007).</ref>\n\nDrums are the most dominant [[musical instrument|instrument]] in popular Kenyan music. Drum beats are very complex and include both native rhythms and imported ones, especially the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] [[cavacha]] rhythm. Popular Kenyan music usually involves the interplay of multiple parts, and more recently, showy guitar solos as well. There are also a number of local hip-hop artists, including [[Jua Cali]]; Afro-pop bands such as [[Sauti Sol]]; and musicians who play local genres like Benga, such as [[Akothee]].\n\nLyrics are most often in Kiswahili or English. There is also some emerging aspect of [[Lingala language|Lingala]] borrowed from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] musicians. Lyrics are also written in local languages. Urban radio generally only plays English music, though there also exist a number of vernacular radio stations.\n\nZilizopendwa is a genre of local urban music that was recorded in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s by musicians such as [[Daudi Kabaka]], [[Fadhili William]], and Sukuma Bin Ongaro, and is particularly enjoyed by older people\u2014having been popularised by the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation's Kiswahili service (formerly called Voice of Kenya or VOK).\n\nThe Isukuti is a vigorous dance performed by the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] sub-tribes to the beat of a traditional drum called the Isukuti during many occasions such as the birth of a child, marriage, or funeral. Other traditional dances include the [[Ohangla]] among the [[Luo peoples|Luo]], [[Nzele]] among the [[Mijikenda peoples|Mijikenda]], [[Mugithi]] among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], and [[Taarab]] among the [[Swahili people|Swahili]].\n\nAdditionally, Kenya has a growing Christian gospel music scene. Prominent local gospel musicians include the [[Kenyan Boys Choir]].\n\n[[Benga music]] has been popular since the late 1960s, especially in the area around [[Lake Victoria]]. The word ''benga'' is occasionally used to refer to any kind of pop music. Bass, guitar, and percussion are the usual instruments.\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Kenya}}\n[[File:2012 Olympics - Womens 5000m start 4.jpg|thumb|left|Jepkosgei Kipyego and Jepkemoi Cheruiyot at the 2012 London Olympics]]\n\nKenya is active in several sports, among them [[cricket]], [[rallying]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby union|rugby]], [[field hockey]], and [[boxing]]. The country is known chiefly for its dominance in [[middle-distance running|middle-distance]] and [[long-distance running|long-distance]] athletics, having consistently produced [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] champions in various distance events, especially in 800&nbsp;m, 1,500&nbsp;m, 3,000&nbsp;m steeplechase, 5,000&nbsp;m, 10,000&nbsp;m, and the marathon. Kenyan athletes (particularly [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]), continue to dominate the world of distance running, although competition from [[Morocco]] and [[Ethiopia]] has reduced this supremacy. Kenya's best-known athletes include the four-time women's [[Boston Marathon]] winner and two-time world champion [[Catherine Ndereba]], 800m world record holder [[David Rudisha]], former [[Marathon (sport)|marathon]] world record-holder [[Paul Tergat]], and [[John Ngugi]].\n\nKenya won several medals during the Beijing Olympics: six gold, four silver, and four bronze, making it Africa's most successful nation in the 2008 Olympics. New athletes gained attention, such as [[Pamela Jelimo]], the women's 800m gold medalist who went on to win the [[IAAF Golden League]] jackpot, and [[Samuel Wanjiru]], who won the men's marathon. Retired Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion [[Kipchoge Keino]] helped usher in Kenya's ongoing distance dynasty in the 1970s and was followed by Commonwealth Champion [[Henry Rono]]'s spectacular string of world record performances. Lately, there has been controversy in Kenyan athletics circles, with the defection of a number of Kenyan athletes to represent other countries, chiefly [[Bahrain]] and [[Qatar]].<ref name=\"IAAF\">IAAF: [http://www.iaaf.net/mm/Document/imported/42196.pdf Changes of Allegiance 1998 to 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509091352/http://www.iaaf.net/mm/Document/imported/42196.pdf |date=9 May 2013 }}.</ref> The Kenyan Ministry of Sports has tried to stop the defections, but they have continued anyway, with [[Bernard Lagat]] being the latest, choosing to represent the United States.<ref name=\"IAAF\"/> Most of these defections occur because of economic or financial factors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4566821.stm|title=Kenya examines track star defections|last=Mynott|first=Adam|date=20 May 2005|work=BBC News|access-date=10 June 2016|via=}}</ref> Decisions by the Kenyan government to tax athletes' earnings may also be a motivating factor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-athletics-kenya-taxes-idUSBREA0L1OM20140122|title=Furious Kenyans threaten to defect over taxes|last=|first=|date=22 January 2014|work=Reuters|access-date=10 June 2016|via=}}</ref> Some elite Kenyan runners who cannot qualify for their country's strong national team find it easier to qualify by running for other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobile.nation.co.ke/Sports/Why+the+defections/-/1951244/1957996/-/format/xhtml/-/hpgsnf/-/index.html|title=Why the defections?|website=mobile.nation.co.ke|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:David Rudisha Daegu 2011.jpg|thumb|Kenyan Olympic and world record holder in the 800 meters, [[David Rudisha]].]]\nKenya has been a dominant force in women's volleyball within Africa, with both the clubs and the national team winning various continental championships in the past decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kenyapage.net/commentary/kenya-sports-commentary/kenya-womens-volleyball-caps-four-decades-of-excellence/|title=Kenya women's volleyball caps three decades of excellence {{!}} Kenya Page Blog|website=kenyapage.net|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chimpreports.com/volleyball-kenya-crowned-african-nations-champions/|title=Volleyball: Champions Kenya Scoop Major Continental Awards {{!}}|website=www.chimpreports.com|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref> The women's team has competed at the Olympics and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|World Championships]], though without any notable success.

In between, they have the 10-o'clock tea (''chai ya saa nne'') and 4&nbsp;p.m. tea (''chai ya saa kumi''). Breakfast is usually tea or porridge with bread, [[chapati]], [[mahamri]], boiled sweet potatoes, or [[Sweet potato|yams]].

She choreographed over 120 dance works, and wrote extensively for a variety of dance publications. In 1948, she was named Woman of the Year in Seattle, and in 1986 was listed as a \"Santa Fe Living Treasure\", also receiving the New Mexico Governor's Artist Award. In 2000, her archive was recognized by the [[White House Millennium Council]]'s \"[[Save America's Treasures]]\" program.\n\n==Biography==\nKing was born on February 8, 1906 in [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown, Pennsylvania]] to George Ilgenfritz and Emma Kate Campbell King. She was the third of six children: Marion, George, Eleanor, Lucile, Robert and John. She attended [[Clare Tree Major]] School of the Theatre in 1925, and [[Theatre Guild School]] in 1926, studying dance with [[Doris Humphrey]] and [[Charles Weidman]]. Humphrey and Weidman had been involved with the pioneering [[Denishawn School]] in [[New York City]], and then split off to form their own [[Humphrey-Weidman]] dance company. King began taking classes from them, and was then invited to be a part of the new dance company.  She made her 1928 debut in ''Color Harmony'', considered the first American [[abstract ballet]]. In 1930, she appeared in [[Leonide Massine]]'s ''Sacre du Printemps'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]]. She stayed with the company until 1935, when she began soloing and choreographing. In 1937 she was a co-founder of the Theater Dance Company, and her first major work, ''Icaro'', was produced in 1938. She became known for choreography based on works of literature, from [[Petrarch]] to [[James Joyce]].\n\nIn 1942, she formed the '''Eleanor King Dance Repertory Company''' in [[Seattle]], followed by the Eleanor King Dance Studio in 1945. In 1955, she studied [[mime]] with [[\u00c9tienne Decroux]]. In the late 1950s, she began studying Japanese [[Noh]] dances. Her first performance of these was in [[Tokyo]] in 1958.  She created the Theatre of the Imagination program at the [[University of Arkansas]], where she taught for much of her career, from 1952 to 1971. She was an assistant professor from 1952\u20131967, associate professor from 1967\u20131971, and was awarded professor emerita status in 1971. In her retirement, she moved to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], and at age 70 began studying classic [[Korean dance]].\n\nIn the 1980s revivals of her work were staged by Annabelle Gamson in 1987 and 1988 in New York. The solos were praised in ''[[The New York Times]]'' for their \"eloquence and for Miss King's careful shaping of ideas and feelings\".\n\n==Death==\nKing was a member of the [[Congress on Research in Dance]], and director of [[Mino Nicolas]]' American Dance Repertory Theater, a position she held until her death on February 27, 1991, nineteen days after her 85th birthday, in [[Englewood, New Jersey]].\n\n==Writing==\n* ''Transformations: The Humphrey-Weidman Era'' (Memoir), Dance Horizons (Brooklyn, NY), 1978\n* King, Eleanor.

She choreographed over 120 dance works, and wrote extensively for a variety of dance publications. In 1948, she was named Woman of the Year in Seattle, and in 1986 was listed as a \"Santa Fe Living Treasure\", also receiving the New Mexico Governor's Artist Award. In 2000, her archive was recognized by the [[White House Millennium Council]]'s \"[[Save America's Treasures]]\" program.\n\n==Biography==\nKing was born on February 8, 1906 in [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown, Pennsylvania]] to George Ilgenfritz and Emma Kate Campbell King. She was the third of six children: Marion, George, Eleanor, Lucile, Robert and John. She attended [[Clare Tree Major]] School of the Theatre in 1925, and [[Theatre Guild School]] in 1926, studying dance with [[Doris Humphrey]] and [[Charles Weidman]]. Humphrey and Weidman had been involved with the pioneering [[Denishawn School]] in [[New York City]], and then split off to form their own [[Humphrey-Weidman]] dance company. King began taking classes from them, and was then invited to be a part of the new dance company.  She made her 1928 debut in ''Color Harmony'', considered the first American [[abstract ballet]]. In 1930, she appeared in [[Leonide Massine]]'s ''Sacre du Printemps'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]]. She stayed with the company until 1935, when she began soloing and choreographing. In 1937 she was a co-founder of the Theater Dance Company, and her first major work, ''Icaro'', was produced in 1938. She became known for choreography based on works of literature, from [[Petrarch]] to [[James Joyce]].\n\nIn 1942, she formed the '''Eleanor King Dance Repertory Company''' in [[Seattle]], followed by the Eleanor King Dance Studio in 1945. In 1955, she studied [[mime]] with [[\u00c9tienne Decroux]]. In the late 1950s, she began studying Japanese [[Noh]] dances. Her first performance of these was in [[Tokyo]] in 1958.  She created the Theatre of the Imagination program at the [[University of Arkansas]], where she taught for much of her career, from 1952 to 1971. She was an assistant professor from 1952\u20131967, associate professor from 1967\u20131971, and was awarded professor emerita status in 1971. In her retirement, she moved to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], and at age 70 began studying classic [[Korean dance]].\n\nIn the 1980s revivals of her work were staged by Annabelle Gamson in 1987 and 1988 in New York. The solos were praised in ''[[The New York Times]]'' for their \"eloquence and for Miss King's careful shaping of ideas and feelings\".\n\n==Death==\nKing was a member of the [[Congress on Research in Dance]], and director of [[Mino Nicolas]]' American Dance Repertory Theater, a position she held until her death on February 27, 1991, aged 85, in [[Englewood, New Jersey]].\n\n==Writing==\n* ''Transformations: The Humphrey-Weidman Era'' (Memoir), Dance Horizons (Brooklyn, NY), 1978\n* King, Eleanor.

The couple persistently worked hard for their money to ensure that their children had the upbringing and opportunities they themselves had missed out on. Hann and Bich were thrifty and by 2004 were financially stable enough to purchase a \"large\" house with a two-car garage on a residential street in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], a town with a large Asian population.<ref name=LauImmigrantDream/> Bich drove a [[Lexus ES 300]] and Hann drove a [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203)]]. They had accumulated [[Canadian dollar|CAD$]]200,000 in savings.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer's parents set many goals for their children and had extremely high expectations of them. Jennifer was made to take piano lessons at the age of four, as well as [[figure skating]] classes where she trained most days during the week. She had hopes of becoming an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] figure skating champion until she tore a ligament in her knee. Jennifer attended [[Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School]] where she played the [[flute]] in the school band.<ref name=Revenge/> According to her high school friend Karen K. Ho, Hann was seen as \"the classic [[tiger parenting|tiger dad]],\" and Bich was \"his reluctant accomplice.\" The Pans picked Jennifer up when classes ended each day and monitored her extracurricular activities very closely. They never permitted her to date boys while attending high school, or to attend high school dances or [[prom]]s out of fear that these activities would distract her from her academic commitments. Jennifer was not permitted to attend any parties while her parents believed that she was attending university. At the age of 22, \"she had never gone to a club, been drunk, visited a friend's cottage or gone on vacation without her family.\"<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer and her friends reportedly regarded this upbringing as restrictive and greatly oppressive.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nDespite her parents' high expectations and the fact that Jennifer had received good grades in lower school, throughout high school her grades were somewhat average (in the 70% range) except for music. Multiple times, she forged [[report card]]s using false templates to show her parents that she had received straight As when she had not. When Jennifer failed calculus class in her senior year of high school, [[Ryerson University]] rescinded her early admission. As she could not bear to be perceived as a failure, she began to lie to those she knew, including her parents, and pretended she was attending university. Instead, she sat in caf\u00e9s, taught as a piano instructor and worked in a restaurant to earn money. In order to maintain the charade, Jennifer told her parents she had won scholarships, later falsely claiming that she had accepted an offer into the pharmacology program at the [[University of Toronto]]. She went to the extent of purchasing second-hand textbooks and watching videos related to pharmacology in order to create notebooks full of purported class notes that she could show her parents. Jennifer also requested permission from her parents to stay near the campus with a friend throughout the week.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer was actually staying with her boyfriend,<ref name=Revenge/> Daniel Chi-Kwong Wong,{{#tag:ref|''Daniel Chi-Kwong Wong'': {{zh|first=t,j|t=\u9ec3\u5fd7\u5149|s=\u9ec4\u5fd7\u5149|j=wong4 zi3 gwong1|p=Hu\u00e1ng Zh\u00ecgu\u0101ng|labels=no}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/toronto/2014-05-10/city1399706077d5044769.html|title=\u7537\u53cb\u7206\u6f58\u5973\u66fe\u906d5\u6f22\u6027\u4fb5 \u8072\u7a31\u6536\u8b66\u544a\u77ed\u8a0a \u77e2\u53e3\u5426\u8a8d\u6d89\u6848|work=[[Sing Tao Daily]]|date=2014-05-10|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref>|group=note}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/4th-arrest-in-markham-home-invasion-homicide-1.1038532|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|title=4th arrest in Markham home invasion homicide|date=2011-04-26|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref> a high school sweetheart whom her parents knew nothing about.<ref name=Revenge/><ref name=\"BrownChineseCubs\">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Vanessa|title=When Chinese cubs turn on their Tiger Parents|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/when-chinese-cubs-turn-on-their-tiger-parents/news-story/36ad884522b2d22ba1e2f88faa5d72ab|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=News.com.au|date=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT31 PT 31]: \"[...]commenting on the fact that he was only half Chinese. \"[...]you're [part] Filipino.\"\"</ref> Wong was of mixed Chinese and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] ancestry,<ref name=\"BrownChineseCubs\">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Vanessa|title=When Chinese cubs turn on their Tiger Parents|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/when-chinese-cubs-turn-on-their-tiger-parents/news-story/36ad884522b2d22ba1e2f88faa5d72ab|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=News.com.au|date=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.es/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT31 PT 31]: \"[...]commenting on the fact that he was only half Chinese. \"[...]you're [part] Filipino.\"\"</ref> resided in [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]],<ref name=GillisWendyFifth>{{cite news|author=Gillis, Wendy|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2011/05/04/fifth_suspect_arrested_in_deadly_markham_home_invasion.html|title=Fifth suspect arrested in deadly Markham home invasion |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=May 4, 2011|accessdate=September 18, 2018}}</ref> and worked at a [[Boston Pizza]] restaurant.<ref name=GrimaldiPT90>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [https://books.google.cz/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT90 PT 90]. \"Daniel Wong is arrested at work in front of his colleagues at Boston Pizza on April 26, 2011.\"</ref> Wong, once a student at Mary Ward, transferred to [[Cardinal Carter Academy]] in North York, Toronto due to low grades<!--\"he was falling behind\"-->, and later studied at [[York University]].<ref name=Revenge/> He was an active [[marijuana]] dealer.<ref name=Revenge/><!--\"he had been charged with trafficking after cops found half a pound of weed in his car.\"--><ref name=Dimannoastonishing>{{cite news|last=Dimanno|first=Rosie|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2014/09/15/the_fantastic_testimony_of_jennifer_pan.html|title=The astonishing testimony of Jennifer Pan|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=September 25, 2018|quote=Seven years until Wong \u2014 Pan says he was the one who put her in touch with \u201cHomeboy,\u201d a man he knew through his marijuana dealing}}</ref>\n\n==Adult life==\nWhile pretending to complete her degree at the University of Toronto, Jennifer told her parents that she had started working as a volunteer at Toronto's [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]], known as Sick Kids. Hann and Bich soon became suspicious when they realized she did not have a hospital ID badge or uniform. On one occasion, Bich followed her daughter to \"work\" and quickly discovered her deception. In a state of shock, Hann wanted to throw Jennifer out of the house, but her mother persuaded him to allow her to stay. As she had not completed high school due to failing calculus, she eventually began working to finish high school completely and was later encouraged by her parents to apply to university. She was, however, forbidden to contact Wong or to go anywhere except to her piano-teaching job. Nevertheless, she and Wong spoke clandestinely during this period.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nBy the time that Jennifer was 24, Wong had grown weary of trying to pursue a relationship with Jennifer. As she was so daunted and restricted by her parents that she lived at home and only met him in secret, Wong began to date another young woman whom he soon fell in love with.<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer quickly invented a new story and told Wong that a man had entered her house, showing what appeared to be a police badge. She then told him that several men had rushed in and [[gang rape]]d her. After this, Jennifer insisted that a bullet was mailed to her, telling Wong that it was sent from his new girlfriend.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\n==Murder==\nIn Spring 2010, Jennifer was in contact with Andrew Montemayor, a high school friend who, she claims, had boasted in their high school years about robbing people at knife point, an assertion denied by Montemayor. Montemayor introduced her to Ricardo Duncan, a \"[[Goth subculture|goth]] kid\" whom Pan gave $1,500 to [[contract killing|kill her father]] in the parking lot at his workplace. Duncan says that she once gave him $200 for a night out, but that he returned it, and that he rebuffed her when she asked him to kill her parents.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer and Wong were back in contact at this time and according to the police, came up with a plan to hire a professional [[hitman]] for $10,000 to kill her parents, calculating that she would then inherit $500,000.

The couple persistently worked hard for their money to ensure that their children had the upbringing and opportunities they themselves had missed out on. Hann and Bich were thrifty and by 2004 were financially stable enough to purchase a \"large\" house with a two-car garage on a residential street in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], a town with a large Asian population.<ref name=LauImmigrantDream/> Bich drove a [[Lexus ES 300]] and Hann drove a [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203)]]. They had accumulated [[Canadian dollar|CAD$]]200,000 in savings.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer's parents set many goals for their children and had extremely high expectations of them. Jennifer was made to take piano lessons at the age of four, as well as [[figure skating]] classes where she trained most days during the week. She had hopes of becoming an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] figure skating champion until she tore a ligament in her knee. Jennifer attended [[Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School]] where she played the [[flute]] in the school band.<ref name=Revenge/> According to her high school friend Karen K. Ho, Hann was seen as \"the classic [[tiger parenting|tiger dad]],\" and Bich was \"his reluctant accomplice.\" The Pans picked Jennifer up when classes ended each day and monitored her extracurricular activities very closely. They never permitted her to date boys while attending high school, or to attend high school dances or [[prom]]s out of fear that these activities would distract her from her academic commitments. Jennifer was not permitted to attend any parties while her parents believed that she was attending university. At the age of 22, \"she had never gone to a club, been drunk, visited a friend's cottage or gone on vacation without her family.\"<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer and her friends reportedly regarded this upbringing as restrictive and greatly oppressive.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nDespite her parents' high expectations and the fact that Jennifer had received good grades in lower school, throughout high school her grades were somewhat average (in the 70% range) except for music. Multiple times, she forged [[report card]]s using false templates to show her parents that she had received straight As when she had not. When Jennifer failed calculus class in her senior year of high school, [[Ryerson University]] rescinded her early admission. As she could not bear to be perceived as a failure, she began to lie to those she knew, including her parents, and pretended she was attending university. Instead, she sat in caf\u00e9s, taught as a piano instructor and worked in a restaurant to earn money. In order to maintain the charade, Jennifer told her parents she had won scholarships, later falsely claiming that she had accepted an offer into the pharmacology program at the [[University of Toronto]]. She went to the extent of purchasing second-hand textbooks and watching videos related to pharmacology in order to create notebooks full of purported class notes that she could show her parents. Jennifer also requested permission from her parents to stay near the campus with a friend throughout the week.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer was actually staying with her boyfriend,<ref name=Revenge/> Daniel Chi-Kwong Wong,{{#tag:ref|''Daniel Chi-Kwong Wong'': {{zh|first=t,j|t=\u9ec3\u5fd7\u5149|s=\u9ec4\u5fd7\u5149|j=wong4 zi3 gwong1|p=Hu\u00e1ng Zh\u00ecgu\u0101ng|labels=no}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/toronto/2014-05-10/city1399706077d5044769.html|title=\u7537\u53cb\u7206\u6f58\u5973\u66fe\u906d5\u6f22\u6027\u4fb5 \u8072\u7a31\u6536\u8b66\u544a\u77ed\u8a0a \u77e2\u53e3\u5426\u8a8d\u6d89\u6848|work=[[Sing Tao Daily]]|date=2014-05-10|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref>|group=note}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/4th-arrest-in-markham-home-invasion-homicide-1.1038532|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|title=4th arrest in Markham home invasion homicide|date=2011-04-26|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref> a high school sweetheart whom her parents knew nothing about.<ref name=Revenge/><ref name=\"BrownChineseCubs\">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Vanessa|title=When Chinese cubs turn on their Tiger Parents|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/when-chinese-cubs-turn-on-their-tiger-parents/news-story/36ad884522b2d22ba1e2f88faa5d72ab|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=News.com.au|date=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT31 PT 31]: \"[...]commenting on the fact that he was only half Chinese. \"[...]you're [part] Filipino.\"\"</ref> Wong was of mixed Chinese and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] ancestry,<ref name=\"BrownChineseCubs\">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Vanessa|title=When Chinese cubs turn on their Tiger Parents|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/when-chinese-cubs-turn-on-their-tiger-parents/news-story/36ad884522b2d22ba1e2f88faa5d72ab|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=News.com.au|date=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.es/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT31 PT 31]: \"[...]commenting on the fact that he was only half Chinese. \"[...]you're [part] Filipino.\"\"</ref> resided in [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]],<ref name=GillisWendyFifth>{{cite news|author=Gillis, Wendy|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2011/05/04/fifth_suspect_arrested_in_deadly_markham_home_invasion.html|title=Fifth suspect arrested in deadly Markham home invasion |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=May 4, 2011|accessdate=September 18, 2018}}</ref> and worked at a [[Boston Pizza]] restaurant.<ref name=GrimaldiPT90>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [https://books.google.cz/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT90 PT 90]. \"Daniel Wong is arrested at work in front of his colleagues at Boston Pizza on April 26, 2011.\"</ref> Wong, once a student at Mary Ward, transferred to [[Cardinal Carter Academy]] in North York, Toronto due to low grades<!--\"he was falling behind\"-->, and later studied at [[York University]].<ref name=Revenge/> He was an active [[marijuana]] dealer.<ref name=Revenge/><!--\"he had been charged with trafficking after cops found half a pound of weed in his car.\"--><ref name=Dimannoastonishing>{{cite news|last=Dimanno|first=Rosie|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2014/09/15/the_fantastic_testimony_of_jennifer_pan.html|title=The astonishing testimony of Jennifer Pan|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=September 25, 2018|quote=Seven years until Wong \u2014 Pan says he was the one who put her in touch with \u201cHomeboy,\u201d a man he knew through his marijuana dealing}}</ref>\n\n==Adult life==\nWhile pretending to complete her degree at the University of Toronto, Jennifer told her parents that she had started working as a volunteer at Toronto's [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]], known as Sick Kids. Hann and Bich soon became suspicious when they realized she did not have a hospital ID badge or uniform. On one occasion, Bich followed her daughter to \"work\" and quickly discovered her deception. In a state of shock, Hann wanted to throw Jennifer out of the house, but her mother persuaded him to allow her to stay. As she had not completed high school due to failing calculus, she eventually began working to finish high school completely and was later encouraged by her parents to apply to university. She was, however, forbidden to contact Wong or to go anywhere except to her piano-teaching job. Nevertheless, she and Wong spoke clandestinely during this period.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nBy the time that Jennifer was 24, Wong had grown weary of trying to pursue a relationship with Jennifer. As she was so daunted and restricted by her parents that she lived at home and only met him in secret, Wong began to date another young woman whom he soon fell in love with.<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer quickly invented a new story and told Wong that a man had entered her house, showing what appeared to be a police badge. She then told him that several men had rushed in and [[gang rape]]d her. After this, Jennifer insisted that a bullet was mailed to her, telling Wong that it was sent from his new girlfriend.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\n==Murder==\nIn Spring 2010, Pan was in contact with Andrew Montemayor, a high school friend who, she claims, had boasted in their high school years about robbing people at knife point, an assertion denied by Montemayor. Montemayor introduced her to Ricardo Duncan, a \"[[Goth subculture|goth]] kid\" whom Pan gave $1,500 to kill her father in the parking lot at his workplace. Duncan says that she once gave him $200 for a night out, but that he returned it, and that he rebuffed her when she asked him to kill her parents.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nPan and Wong were back in contact at this time and according to the police, came up with a plan to hire a professional [[hitman]] for $10,000 to kill her parents, calculating that she would then inherit $500,000.

Against that ideological background, China took a belligerent stance towards the West, and publicly rejected the USSR's policy of peaceful coexistence between the [[Eastern bloc]] and the [[Western bloc]].<ref name=\"World History 2000. p.&nbsp;769\"/> In addition, China resented the closer Soviet ties with India, and Moscow feared Mao was too nonchalant about the horrors of nuclear war.<ref>John W.

Mao and the Chinese leadership were appalled as the PRC and the USSR progressively diverged in their interpretations and applications of Marxism.

In light of de-Stalinization, the CPSU's changed ideological orientation \u2013 from Stalin's confrontation of the West to Khrushchev's coexistence with the West \u2013 posed problems of ideological credibility and political authority for Mao, who had emulated Stalin's style of leadership and practical application of Marxism\u2013Leninism in the development of [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]] and the PRC as a country.<ref>L\u00fcthi, Lorenz M.

China denounced the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (1945\u20131992) as insufficiently socialist for having a [[mixed economy]]. Mao personally criticized [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]] as an ideological deviationist for pursuing a [[Non-Aligned Movement|politically non-aligned]] foreign policy that was separate and apart from Sino-Soviet geopolitics. Khrushchev criticized the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] as a politically-backward state and the Albanian leader, [[Enver Hoxha]], for not transcending [[Stalinism]] and for allying with China, which provoked the [[Soviet\u2013Albanian split]] (1955\u20131961).

In Paris, at the [[1960 Paris Summit|Four Powers Summit]] meeting (15\u201316 May 1960), Khrushchev demanded and failed to receive Eisenhower's apology for the CIA's continued aerial espionage of the USSR.

Mao said that Khrushchev's emphases on consumer goods and material plenty would make the Russian people ideologically soft and un-revolutionary, to which Khrushchev replied: 'If we could promise the people nothing, except revolution, they would scratch their heads and say: \"Isn\u2019t it better to have good goulash?\" '<ref>Mark, Chi-kwan (2012) \"Ideological Radicalization and the Sino-Soviet split, 1956\u201364\", ''China and the World since 1945 \u2013 An international History'', Routledge, p. 49.</ref>\n\n===Personal attacks===\nIn the 1960s, public displays of acrimonious quarrels about abstract Marxist doctrine characterized relations between Stalinist Chinese and anti-Stalinist Russian communists. At the Romanian Communist Party Congress, the CPC's [[Peng Zhen]] quarrelled with Khrushchev, after the latter had insulted Mao as being a Chinese nationalist, a geopolitical adventurist, and an [[Deviationism|ideological deviationist]] from Orthodox Marxism. In turn, Peng insulted Khrushchev as a [[Anti-revisionism|Marxist revisionist]] whose r\u00e9gimer of the USSR showed him to be a \"patriarchal, arbitrary, and tyrannical\" ruler.<ref>Allen Axelrod, ''The Real History of the Cold War: A New Look at the Past'', p.&nbsp;213.</ref> In the event, Khrushchev denounced the PRC with eighty pages of criticism to the congress of the PRC. In June 1960, at the zenith of de-Stalinization, the USSR denounced Albania as a politically backward country for retaining [[Stalinism]] as government and model of socialism. In turn, Bao Sansan said that the CPC's message to the cadres in China was: 'When Khrushchev stopped Russian aid to Albania, Hoxha said to his people: \"Even if we have to eat the roots of grass to live, we won\u2019t take anything from Russia.\" China is not guilty of [[chauvinism]], and immediately sent food to our brother country.'<ref>Sansan, Bao and Lord, Bette Bao (1964\u20131966) ''Eighth Moon: The True Story of a Young Girl's Life in Communist China'', New York: Scholastic, p.&nbsp;123.</ref>\n\nIn response to the insults, Khrushchev withdrew 1,400 Soviet technicians from the PRC, which cancelled some 200 joint-scientific-projects meant to foster Sino-Soviet amity and co-operation between socialist nations. In response, Mao justified his belief that Khrushchev had, somehow, caused China's great economic failures, and the famines occurred in the period of the Great Leap Forward; nonetheless, the PRC and the USSR remained pragmatic allies, which allowed Mao to alleviate famine in China and to resolve Sino-Indian border disputes. To Mao, Khrushchev had lost political authority and ideological credibility, because his Soviet-American ''[[d\u00e9tente]]'' had resulted in successful military (aerial) espionage against the USSR, and public confrontation with an unapologetic capitalist enemy.

Despite the border demarcation remaining indeterminate, the premiers' meetings restored Sino-Soviet diplomatic communications, which, by 1970, allowed Mao to understand that the PRC could not simultaneously fight the US and the USSR, whilst suppressing internal disorders throughout China.

In light of de-Stalinization, the CPSU's changed ideological orientation \u2013 from Stalin's confrontation of the West to Khrushchev's coexistence with the West \u2013 posed problems of ideological credibility and political authority for Mao, who had emulated Stalin's style of leadership and practical application of Marxism\u2013Leninism in the development of [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]] and the PRC as a country.<ref>L\u00fcthi, Lorenz M.

In response to that discontent among the European members of the Eastern Bloc, the CPC denounced the USSR's de-Stalinization as [[Marxist revisionism]], and reaffirmed the Stalinist ideology, policies, and practices of Mao's government as the correct course for achieving socialism in China.

Formal, ideological response to that geopolitical contingency compelled Khrushchev to revise the USSR's policy of peaceful coexistence to include regional wars, such as Mao's second war-crisis in the strait of Taiwan. Mao's withholding of information from Khrushchev worsened their personal-political relations, especially because the U.S. threatened nuclear war upon China and Russia, if the PRC invaded Taiwan; thus did Mao's continual shoot-outs with Chiang Kai-shek impel Khrushchev into Sino-American quarrels about the long-lost civil war in China.<ref>L\u00fcthi, Lorenz M.

China denounced the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (1945\u20131992) as insufficiently socialist for having a [[mixed economy]]. Mao personally criticized [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]] as an ideological deviationist for pursuing a [[Non-Aligned Movement|politically non-aligned]] foreign policy that was separate and apart from Sino-Soviet geopolitics.

In Paris, at the [[1960 Paris Summit|Four Powers Summit]] meeting (15\u201316 May 1960), Khrushchev demanded and failed to receive Eisenhower's apology for the CIA's continued aerial espionage of the USSR.

Mao said that Khrushchev's emphases on consumer goods and material plenty would make the Russian people ideologically soft and un-revolutionary, to which Khrushchev replied: 'If we could promise the people nothing, except revolution, they would scratch their heads and say: \"Isn\u2019t it better to have good goulash?\" '<ref>Mark, Chi-kwan (2012) \"Ideological Radicalization and the Sino-Soviet split, 1956\u201364\", ''China and the World since 1945 \u2013 An international History'', Routledge, p. 49.</ref>\n\n===Personal attacks===\nIn the 1960s, public displays of acrimonious quarrels about abstract Marxist doctrine characterized relations between Stalinist Chinese and anti-Stalinist Russian communists. At the Romanian Communist Party Congress, the CPC's [[Peng Zhen]] quarrelled with Khrushchev, after the latter had insulted Mao as being a Chinese nationalist, a geopolitical adventurist, and an [[Deviationism|ideological deviationist]] from Orthodox Marxism. In turn, Peng insulted Khrushchev as a [[Anti-revisionism|Marxist revisionist]] whose r\u00e9gimer of the USSR showed him to be a \"patriarchal, arbitrary, and tyrannical\" ruler.<ref>Allen Axelrod, ''The Real History of the Cold War: A New Look at the Past'', p.&nbsp;213.</ref> In the event, Khrushchev denounced the PRC with eighty pages of criticism to the congress of the PRC. In June 1960, at the zenith of de-Stalinization, the USSR denounced Albania as a politically backward country for retaining [[Stalinism]] as government and model of socialism. In turn, Bao Sansan said that the CPC's message to the cadres in China was: 'When Khrushchev stopped Russian aid to Albania, Hoxha said to his people: \"Even if we have to eat the roots of grass to live, we won\u2019t take anything from Russia.\" China is not guilty of [[chauvinism]], and immediately sent food to our brother country.'<ref>Sansan, Bao and Lord, Bette Bao (1964\u20131966) ''Eighth Moon: The True Story of a Young Girl's Life in Communist China'', New York: Scholastic, p.&nbsp;123.</ref>\n\nIn response to the insults, Khrushchev withdrew 1,400 Soviet technicians from the PRC, which cancelled some 200 joint-scientific-projects meant to foster Sino-Soviet amity and co-operation between socialist nations. In response, Mao justified his belief that Khrushchev had, somehow, caused China's great economic failures, and the famines occurred in the period of the Great Leap Forward; nonetheless, the PRC and the USSR remained pragmatic allies, which allowed Mao to alleviate famine in China and to resolve Sino-Indian border disputes. To Mao, Khrushchev had lost political authority and ideological credibility, because his Soviet-American ''[[d\u00e9tente]]'' had resulted in successful military (aerial) espionage against the USSR, and public confrontation with an unapologetic capitalist enemy.

She grew up especially close to her younger brother, Bartley Crum Jr. Their father was active in politics as a confidant to [[Wendell Willkie]] during the [[1940 U.S. presidential election]] campaign, and served on the 1945 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into [[Palestine]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} that advised President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] to support the creation of a [[Jewish state]]. The elder Crum gained notoriety for being one of the six lawyers who defended the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] during the [[Red Scare]] at the start of the [[Cold War]] in 1947. His career suffered during the fallout from the Blacklist, and the family moved from California to New York in late 1948.<ref name=Anything/>\n\nIn California, Bosworth had been educated at [[Miss Burke's School]] and the [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York City)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]]. At age 13, intending to become an actress, she adopted her mother's maiden name as her surname. When the family relocated to New York, Bosworth first attended the [[Chapin School]] and then the [[Ecole Internationale de Gen\u00e8ve|Ecole International]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Bosworth studied at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], graduating in 1955 with a major in dance and writing.\n\n==Career==\n===Acting===\nWhile still a student at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth began modeling for the [[John Robert Powers Agency]]. She was hired by [[Diane Arbus|Diane]] and [[Allan Arbus]] to pose for a magazine ad for the [[Greyhound bus]] company. Allan drove everyone, including his and Diane's assistant Tad Yamashiro (who later became an exhibited photographer himself), from [[Manhattan]] to the Ardsley Acres section of [[Ardsley, New York]] for the photo shoot.\n\nShortly after her college graduation, Bosworth became a member of the [[Actors Studio]] in Manhattan, where she studied under master teacher [[Lee Strasberg]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Garfield|first=David|year=1980|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|page=277|isbn=978-0025426504}}.</ref> [[Arthur Penn]] cast her as the lead in her first professional play, a pre-Broadway tryout of [[James Leo Herlihy]]\u2019s ''Blue Denim'', about the consequences of teenage pregnancy and abortion. Bosworth appeared in several Broadway shows during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Small War on Murray Hill]]'' (directed by [[Garson Kanin]]), and [[Jean Kerr]]'s ''[[Mary Mary|Mary, Mary]]'' (where she understudied from 1961-1965 before being cast as the lead for the end of the play's run). She played [[Elaine Stritch]]'s sister in the drama ''The Sin of Pat Muldoon'' and a motormouthed teen based on the young [[Nora Ephron]] in [[Phoebe Ephron]]'s comedy ''Howie''. During this period Bosworth also toured in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', playing Laura to [[Helen Hayes]]'s Amanda, and ''Remains to be Seen'' opposite Tommy Sands. She worked regularly on popular television series including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[Young Doctor Malone|Young Dr. Malone]]'', and ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]''. Bosworth can also be seen in the film ''[[Four Boys and a Gun]]'' as [[James Franciscus]]'s wife, and as a disgruntled redhead in the audience of [[Bert Stern]]\u2019s 1960 cult documentary ''[[Jazz on a Summer's Day]]'', about the 1958 [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nAs an actress, Bosworth is perhaps best known for playing Sister Simone, the young friend of [[Audrey Hepburn|Audrey Hepburn's]] character Sister Luke, in ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'' (1959).  Directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], the film was a major box office success and nominated for multiple Academy Awards. In 1958, upon learning she was cast in ''The Nun's Story'', she also learned she was pregnant. She subsequently received an abortion at an underground abortionist in Manhattan''.'' Shortly after, she boarded a plane to [[Rome]] to meet Fred Zinnemann, where she began to hemorrhage. In Rome, she was sent to a hospital convent where she was to learn about being a nun. The nun discovered she wasn't feeling well due to the abortion and rushed her to the hospital for care. The film was delayed for her recovery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/28/511863277/renowned-biographer-patricia-bosworth-writes-a-chapter-from-her-own-life|title=Renowned Biographer Patricia Bosworth Writes A Chapter From Her Own Life|author=NPR Staff|work=[[NPR]]|publisher=National Public Radio, Inc.|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|language=en|date=January 28, 2017|access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Journalist===\nIn the mid-1960s, Bosworth left acting to become a journalist. She gained notice as a writer with several Broadway-focused features and interviews published in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] and the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Later in the decade, she became editor of ''[[Screen Stars]]'' magazine and worked at Magazine Management Company alongside [[Mario Puzo]], who was then beginning drafts of his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. From 1969 to 1972 Bosworth was senior editor of ''[[McCall's]]''; she served as managing editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' from 1972 to 1974. ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' founder [[Bob Guccione]] hired Bosworth as executive editor of the erotic women's magazine ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'' from 1974 to 1976.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The X-Rated Emperor|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/02/guccione200502|issn=0733-8899|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|location=United States|date=November 10, 2009|| publication-date=February 2005|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, Bosworth reviewed numerous books for the ''The New York Times'', wrote freelance art pieces for the ''Times'', ''[[Time Life]]'', and other national magazines, and contributed a monthly column on arts and entertainment to ''[[Working Woman (magazine)|Working Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nBosworth was an editor at ''[[Mirabella]]'' from 1993 to 1995. She was first hired as a contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1984, under [[Tina Brown]]\u2019s editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under [[Graydon Carter]]\u2019s leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of [[Elia Kazan]] and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', won Bosworth the [[Front Page Award]] from the Newswomen's Club of New York.\n\n===Author===\nBosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on [[Montgomery Clift]] (1978), [[Diane Arbus]] (1984), [[Marlon Brando]] (2000) and [[Jane Fonda]] (2011). Her book, ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography'' explores how the actor's introverted approach to his craft influenced [[James Dean]] and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift's lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift's family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift's close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth's biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus's 1971 suicide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|title=Diane Arbus: A Biography|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0394504049}}</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have... more than enough material for several art legends... Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography... as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=Anything/> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nDuring Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would continue to inform Bosworth's work throughout her life.\n\nDuring her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright [[Mel Arrighi]] in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from [[emphysema]] on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer [[Tom Palumbo]], whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the [[Actors Studio]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], including a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'' starring [[Laura Linney]] as Nina and [[Tammy Grimes]] as Arkadina. They married in 2000. Palumbo died due to complications from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center.\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to [[pneumonia]] and complications from  [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], twenty-two days away from her 87th birthday.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html|title=Patricia Bosworth, Actress-Turned-Author, Dies at 86|first=Elsa|last=Dixler|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.

Bosworth appeared in several Broadway shows during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Small War on Murray Hill]]'' (directed by [[Garson Kanin]]), and [[Jean Kerr]]'s ''[[Mary Mary|Mary, Mary]]'' (where she understudied from 1961-1965 before being cast as the lead for the end of the play's run). She played [[Elaine Stritch]]'s sister in the drama ''The Sin of Pat Muldoon'' and a motormouthed teen based on the young [[Nora Ephron]] in [[Phoebe Ephron]]'s comedy ''Howie''. During this period Bosworth also toured in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', playing Laura to [[Helen Hayes]]'s Amanda, and ''Remains to be Seen'' opposite Tommy Sands. She worked regularly on popular television series including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[Young Doctor Malone|Young Dr. Malone]]'', and ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]''. Bosworth can also be seen in the film ''[[Four Boys and a Gun]]'' as [[James Franciscus]]'s wife, and as a disgruntled redhead in the audience of [[Bert Stern]]\u2019s 1960 cult documentary ''[[Jazz on a Summer's Day]]'', about the 1958 [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nAs an actress, Bosworth is perhaps best known for playing Sister Simone, the young friend of [[Audrey Hepburn|Audrey Hepburn's]] character Sister Luke, in ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'' (1959).  Directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], the film was a major box office success and nominated for multiple Academy Awards. In 1958, upon learning she was cast in ''The Nun's Story'', she also learned she was pregnant. She subsequently received an abortion at an underground abortionist in Manhattan''.'' Shortly after, she boarded a plane to [[Rome]] to meet Fred Zinnemann, where she began to hemorrhage. In Rome, she was sent to a hospital convent where she was to learn about being a nun. The nun discovered she wasn't feeling well due to the abortion and rushed her to the hospital for care. The film was delayed for her recovery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/28/511863277/renowned-biographer-patricia-bosworth-writes-a-chapter-from-her-own-life|title=Renowned Biographer Patricia Bosworth Writes A Chapter From Her Own Life|author=NPR Staff|work=[[NPR]]|publisher=National Public Radio, Inc.|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|language=en|date=January 28, 2017|access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Journalist===\nIn the mid-1960s, Bosworth left acting to become a journalist. She gained notice as a writer with several Broadway-focused features and interviews published in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] and the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Later in the decade, she became editor of ''[[Screen Stars]]'' magazine and worked at Magazine Management Company alongside [[Mario Puzo]], who was then beginning drafts of his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. From 1969 to 1972 Bosworth was senior editor of ''[[McCall's]]''; she served as managing editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' from 1972 to 1974. ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' founder [[Bob Guccione]] hired Bosworth as executive editor of the erotic women's magazine ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'' from 1974 to 1976.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The X-Rated Emperor|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/02/guccione200502|issn=0733-8899|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|location=United States|date=November 10, 2009|| publication-date=February 2005|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, Bosworth reviewed numerous books for the ''The New York Times'', wrote freelance art pieces for the ''Times'', ''[[Time Life]]'', and other national magazines, and contributed a monthly column on arts and entertainment to ''[[Working Woman (magazine)|Working Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nBosworth was an editor at ''[[Mirabella]]'' from 1993 to 1995. She was first hired as a contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1984, under [[Tina Brown]]\u2019s editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under [[Graydon Carter]]\u2019s leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of [[Elia Kazan]] and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', won Bosworth the [[Front Page Award]] from the Newswomen's Club of New York.\n\n===Author===\nBosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on [[Montgomery Clift]] (1978), [[Diane Arbus]] (1984), [[Marlon Brando]] (2000) and [[Jane Fonda]] (2011). Her book, ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography'' explores how the actor's introverted approach to his craft influenced [[James Dean]] and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift's lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift's family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift's close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth's biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus's 1971 suicide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|title=Diane Arbus: A Biography|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0394504049}}</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have... more than enough material for several art legends... Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography... as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=Anything/> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nDuring Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would continue to inform Bosworth's work throughout her life.\n\nDuring her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright [[Mel Arrighi]] in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from [[emphysema]] on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer [[Tom Palumbo]], whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the [[Actors Studio]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], including a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'' starring [[Laura Linney]] as Nina and [[Tammy Grimes]] as Arkadina. They married in 2000. Palumbo died due to complications from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center.\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to [[pneumonia]] and complications from  [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], at the age of 86.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html|title=Patricia Bosworth, Actress-Turned-Author, Dies at 86|first=Elsa|last=Dixler|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.
