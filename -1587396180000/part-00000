The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

His current title is [[Servant of God]].\n\n==Early life and studies==\nCiszek was born on November 4, 1904, in the mining town of [[Shenandoah, Pennsylvania]], to Polish immigrants Mary (Mika) and Martin Ciszek,  who had emigrated to the [[United States]] in the 1890s.<ref name=league/> A former gang member, he shocked his family by deciding to become a priest. Ciszek entered the Jesuit [[novitiate]] in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]], [[New York State|New York]] in 1928. The following year, he volunteered to serve as a missionary to Russia, which had become the Soviet Union after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] 12 years before. Many religious rights for Soviet residents were [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|curtailed]], religious believers were openly [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union| persecuted]], and few religious believers had access to the services of a priest. Pope [[Pius XI]] made an appeal to priests from around the world to go to Russia as missionaries.<ref name=league>[http://www.ciszek.org/About_Ciszek.html \"About Father Ciszek\", the Father Walter Ciszek Prayer League]</ref>\n\nIn 1934, Ciszek was sent to [[Rome]] to study [[theology]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], the [[history of Russia]] and [[Eastern Catholicism|liturgy]] at the Pontifical Russian College (or '[[Russicum]]'). In 1937, he was ordained a [[priest]] in the [[Byzantine Rite]] in Rome taking the name of Vladimir (see [[Russian Greek Catholic Church]]).<ref>Members of the Byzantine Rite [[Russian Catholic Church]], like members of other [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], are in [[full communion]] with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] but differ in rites, customs and canon law from the western, or Latin Rite Catholic Church. The majority of Catholics in Russia have always been members of the Latin Rite church, however.</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Ciszek was sent to the Jesuit mission in Albertyn in eastern [[Poland]].<ref name=league/> With  the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] occupied eastern Poland and forced Ciszek to close his mission. Arriving in [[Lviv]], he realized that it would be very easy for a priest or two to enter the Soviet Union amid the streams of exiles going East. After securing the permission of [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Andrei Sheptytsky]], he crossed the border in 1940 under the assumed identity of ''W\u0142adymyr \u0141ypynski''. With two of his fellow Jesuits, he travelled {{convert|2400|km}} by train to the logging town of [[Chusovoy]], in the [[Ural Mountains]]. For one year, he worked as an unskilled logger, while discreetly performing religious ministry at the same time.\n\n==Captivity in the Soviet Union==\n{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}\nCiszek was arrested in 1941 under accusations of [[espionage]] for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and sent to the [[Lubyanka prison]] in Moscow, operated by the [[NKVD]] (internal security agency). There he spent a total of five years, most of which in [[solitary confinement]]. In 1942, he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]] under severe torture. He was convicted of [[espionage]] and  [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to 15 years hard labor in the GULAG.\n\nCiszek was to remain in Lubyanka for four more years. In 1946, he was sent by train to [[Krasnoyarsk]] then 20 days by boat to [[Norilsk]] in [[Siberia]]. There, he was to shovel coal onto [[Cargo ship|freighter]] [[Ship|vessels]], and later transferred to work in [[coal mine]]s. A year later, he was sent to work in construction at an ore processing plant. From 1953 to 1955, he worked in mines. His memoirs provide a vivid description of the revolts that spread through the GULAG in the aftermath of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death (see [[Norilsk uprising]]).\n\nThroughout his lengthy imprisonment, Ciszek continued to pray, to celebrate [[Divine Liturgy]], hear [[Confession (religion)|confession]]s, conduct [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]]s and perform parish ministry. Until he was allowed to write to America in 1955, he was presumed dead by both his family and the Jesuit Order.\n\nBy April 22, 1955, Ciszek's hard labor sentence was complete, and he was released with restrictions in the city of Norilsk. At this time, he was finally able to write to his sisters in the United States.\n\nCiszek was ordered by the [[KGB]] to move in 1958 to Krasnoyarsk, where he secretly established mission parishes. After the KGB learned of this, he was forcibly transferred to [[Abakan]], {{convert|160|km}} to the south, where he worked as an automobile mechanic for four more years. In 1963, he finally received a letter from his sisters in the U.S. Several months later, the Soviet Union decided to return him (and an American student [[Marvin W. Makinen]]) to the United States in exchange for two Soviet agents. He was not informed of this until he was delivered to an official of the [[U.S. State Department]] and told he was still an American citizen.\n\n==Release and later life==\n{{Jesuit}}\nAfter nearly 23 years of imprisonment, Ciszek was released with American student [[Marvin Makinen]] on October 12, 1963, in exchange for two Soviet agents (Ivan Egorov, a Soviet U.N. functionary, and his wife Alexandra, arrested for espionage in July). After his return, he is quoted as stating, \"I am an American, happy to be home; but in many ways I am almost a stranger.\"  In 1965, he began working and lecturing at the John XXIII Center at [[Fordham University]] (now the Center for Eastern Christian Studies at the [[University of Scranton]] in [[Scranton]], [[Pennsylvania]]), counseling and offering spiritual direction to those who visited him, until his death.\n\nOn December 8, 1984, Ciszek died after many years of declining health, and was [[burial|buried]] at the Jesuit Cemetery in [[Wernersville]], [[Pennsylvania]].\n\n[[Image:Walter ciszek tomb 2004.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Walter Ciszek's grave at the Jesuit Center in Wernersville, Pennsylvania.]]\n\n==Legacy==\nNine audio tapes of interviews conducted with Ciszek (ca. 1964) remain at [[Georgetown University]].\n\nIn 1985, a [[Carmelite]] [[nun]], Mother Marija, who was the [[:wikt:mother superior|mother superior]] of a [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Rite]] Carmelite monastery which Fr. Ciszek helped found, and formerly under his spiritual direction, began to petition for official recognition of Fr. Ciszek and his work within the Catholic Church. In 1990, Bishop Michael J. Dudick of the [[Eparchy]] of [[Passaic, New Jersey]], opened an official diocesan process of investigation for official recognition on the road to beatification, a step toward possible [[canonization]] as a [[saint]]. His case is currently being handled by the [[Diocese]] of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].\n\nCiszek Hall at [[Fordham University]] in [[New York City]] is named after Fr. Ciszek. It currently houses Jesuit scholastics in the first stage of formal study for the priesthood. Additionally, a small room has been set aside in honor of Fr. Ciszek.  It contains the (Latin) altar, sacred vessels, candle sticks, and crucifix Fr. Ciszek used, as well as a copy (in his own hand) of his final vows and a photocopy of a letter to a friend containing spiritual advice.  There is also a Ciszek Hall at the [[University of Scranton]]. Shenandoah, Pennsylvania also commemorated his legacy by the founding of a Catholic elementary school named Father Walter J. Ciszek School, later renamed Trinity Academy at the Father Walter J. Ciszek Education Center. [[Marquette University]]'s Walter Ciszek Collection is named for Fr. Ciszek, and is maintained by the university's [[Knights of Columbus]] council.  The collection is held in Raynor Memorial Library and contains various Catholic literature and video materials.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marquette.edu/library/about/ciszek.php}}</ref>  Additionally, the council sponsors an annual Ciszek Lecture at Marquette, which was established in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marquette.edu/news-center/2019/marquette-to-host-microsoft-chief-technology-officer-for-ciszek-lecture.php}}</ref>\n\n==Quotes==\n*The power of prayer reaches beyond all efforts of man seeking to find meaning in life.

There was but a single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will.  I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in which I found myself, and let myself be ruled by it.  God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things.  To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust.  Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him.  The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me no matter what it might bring.  The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained to remind me of the weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self.  But it no longer depressed me.  I looked no longer to self to guide me, relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, I was relieved as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.<ref name=ciszek>{{cite book|last=Ciszek|first=Walter J.|title=He Leadeth Me|year=1973|publisher=Doubleday & Company, Inc.|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=0-89870-546-0|pages=79\u201380|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmdVjLpJ5HUC&lpg=PA79&vq=across%20the%20threshold&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q=across%20that%20threshold%20I%20had%20been%20afraid%20to%20cross&f=false}}</ref>\n*His will for us was in the twenty-four hours of each day: the people, the places, the circumstances He set before us in that time.

This was followed by a supporting role as [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay adopted son, David, in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of Fierstein's ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''; then, a good review by ''[[The New York Times]]'' theater critic [[Mel Gussow]] brought him to the attention of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Broderick commented on the effects of that review in a 2004 ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' interview:\n\n<blockquote>Before I knew it, I was like this guy in a hot play. And suddenly, all these doors opened. And it's only because Mel Gussow happened to come by right before it closed and happened to like it. It's just amazing. All these things have to line up that are out of your control.</blockquote>\n\nHe followed that with the role of Eugene Morris Jerome in the [[Neil Simon]] ''[[Eugene Trilogy]]'' including the plays ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' and ''[[Biloxi Blues]]''. He won the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play]] for his role in ''Brighton Beach Memoirs''.\n\nHis first film role was also written by Neil Simon. Broderick debuted in ''[[Max Dugan Returns]]'' (1983).

At the age of 23, Broderick played a high school student who, with his girlfriend and best friend, [[truant|plays hooky]] and explores [[Chicago]]. The film is a 1980s comedy favorite, and is one of Broderick's best known roles (particularly with teenage audiences).  Also in 1987, he played Air Force research assistant Jimmy Garrett in ''[[Project X (1987 film)|Project X]]''. In 1988, Broderick played [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay lover, Alan, in the screen adaptation of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''.\n\nHe starred in the 1989 film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' alongside [[Cary Elwes]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Denzel Washington]], where he received favorable reviews for his portrayal of the [[American Civil War]] officer [[Robert Gould Shaw]], whom Broderick incidentally physically resembled at the time.\n\nIn the 1990s, Broderick was the voice of the adult [[Simba]], in Disney's successful animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'', and also voiced Tack the Cobbler in [[Miramax]]'s controversial version of ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'', which had originally been intended as a silent role. He won recognition for two [[black comedy|dark comedy]] roles. The first was that of a bachelor in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' with [[Jim Carrey]]. The second was that of a high school teacher in Alexander Payne's ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'' with [[Reese Witherspoon]].\n\nBroderick returned to Broadway as a [[musical theatre|musical]] star in the 1990s, winning a [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] for his performance in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''. Broderick then starred alongside [[Nathan Lane]] in the [[Mel Brooks]] 2001 stage version of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' which was a critical and financial success. He played Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom, an accountant who co-produces a musical designed to fail, but which turns out to be successful. Broderick was nominated for another [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] but lost to his fellow co-star Nathan Lane.

A veteran of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Martindale, who belonged to the [[20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment|20th Connecticut]], was killed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and was eventually interred in an unnamed grave at the [[Marietta National Cemetery]]. Having identified the grave with the help of historian Brad Quinlin, Broderick's research enabled him to give his ancestor his name back. In the same program, Broderick discovered that his paternal grandfather, James Joseph Broderick II, whom he had never known, had been a highly decorated combat medic in [[World War I]], having earned his distinctions during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n===1987 car crash===\nOn August 5, 1987, while driving a rented [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|BMW 316]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[Northern Ireland]], Broderick crossed into the wrong lane and collided head-on with a [[Volvo]] driven by Anna Gallagher, 28,<ref>{{cite web |title=Broderick To Be Tried in Car Crash Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/arts/broderick-to-be-tried-in-car-crash-death.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=23 August 2019 |date=8 September 1987}}</ref> accompanied by her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, killing both instantly.

This was followed by a supporting role as [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay adopted son, David, in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of Fierstein's ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''; then, a good review by ''[[The New York Times]]'' theater critic [[Mel Gussow]] brought him to the attention of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Broderick commented on the effects of that review in a 2004 ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' interview:\n\n<blockquote>Before I knew it, I was like this guy in a hot play. And suddenly, all these doors opened. And it's only because Mel Gussow happened to come by right before it closed and happened to like it. It's just amazing. All these things have to line up that are out of your control.</blockquote>\n\nHe followed that with the role of Eugene Morris Jerome in the [[Neil Simon]] ''[[Eugene Trilogy]]'' including the plays ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' and ''[[Biloxi Blues]]''. He won the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play]] for his role in ''Brighton Beach Memoirs''.\n\nHis first film role was also written by Neil Simon. Broderick debuted in ''[[Max Dugan Returns]]'' (1983).

At the age of 23, Broderick played a high school student who, with his girlfriend and best friend, [[truant|plays hooky]] and explores [[Chicago]]. The film is a 1980s comedy favorite, and is one of Broderick's best known roles (particularly with teenage audiences).  Also in 1987, he played Air Force research assistant Jimmy Garrett in ''[[Project X (1987 film)|Project X]]''. In 1988, Broderick played [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay lover, Alan, in the screen adaptation of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''.\n\nHe starred in the 1989 film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' alongside [[Cary Elwes]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Denzel Washington]], where he received favorable reviews for his portrayal of the [[American Civil War]] officer [[Robert Gould Shaw]], whom Broderick incidentally physically resembled at the time.\n\nIn the 1990s, Broderick was the voice of the adult [[Simba]], in Disney's successful animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'', and also voiced Tack the Cobbler in [[Miramax]]'s controversial version of ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'', which had originally been intended as a silent role. He won recognition for two [[black comedy|dark comedy]] roles. The first was that of a bachelor in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' with [[Jim Carrey]]. The second was that of a high school teacher in Alexander Payne's ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'' with [[Reese Witherspoon]].\n\nBroderick returned to Broadway as a [[musical theatre|musical]] star in the 1990s, winning a [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] for his performance in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''. Broderick then starred alongside [[Nathan Lane]] in the [[Mel Brooks]] 2001 stage version of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' which was a critical and financial success. He played Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom, an accountant who co-produces a musical designed to fail, but which turns out to be successful. Broderick was nominated for another [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] but lost to his fellow co-star Nathan Lane.

Broderick stated that his participation in the ancestry research program emotionally reconnected him with the role he played in ''Glory'' 22 years earlier, as he discovered a paternal great-great-grandfather, Robert Martindale, was a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier. A veteran of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Martindale, who belonged to the [[20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment|20th Connecticut]], was killed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and was eventually interred in an unnamed grave at the [[Marietta National Cemetery]]. Having identified the grave with the help of historian Brad Quinlin, Broderick's research enabled him to give his ancestor his name back. In the same program, Broderick discovered that his paternal grandfather, James Joseph Broderick II, whom he had never known, had been a highly decorated combat medic in [[World War I]], having earned his distinctions during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n===1987 car crash===\nOn August 5, 1987, while driving a rented [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|BMW 316]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[Northern Ireland]], Broderick crossed into the wrong lane and collided head-on with a [[Volvo]] driven by Anna Gallagher, 28,<ref>{{cite web |title=Broderick To Be Tried in Car Crash Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/arts/broderick-to-be-tried-in-car-crash-death.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=23 August 2019 |date=8 September 1987}}</ref> accompanied by her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, killing both instantly.
