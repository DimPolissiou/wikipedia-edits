The title of ''General'' (three stars) included the officer's branch of service, leading to the titles of ''General der Infanterie'' (\"[[General of the Infantry (Germany)|general of the infantry]]\"), ''General der Kavallerie'' (\"general of the [[cavalry]]\") and ''General der Artillerie'' (\"[[General of the Artillery (Germany)|general of the artillery]]\").\n\nIn 1854, Prussia introduced the rank of ''[[Colonel General|Generaloberst]]'' (supreme general, usually (mis)translated colonel-general) so that officers could be promoted further than ''General'' without becoming a ''Generalfeldmarschall'', as this rank was usually bestowed only for extraordinary achievements during wartime service. Later, another special grade known as ''Generaloberst im Range eines Generalfeldmarschalls'' (supreme general in the rank of a [[field marshal]]) was first used in Bavaria to denote supreme generals who were given the authority of field marshals without the actual rank.\n\nDuring the [[German Empire]], the insignia of German generals was established as a heavy golden shoulder board with up to four pips (stars) denoting seniority as a general.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The rank of ''Generalfeldmarschall'' displayed a crossed set of marshal's [[Baton (symbol)|baton]]s on the shoulder board.

The shoulder board rank was crossed batons with three pips. The rank of supreme general proper (with three pips only) was created in 1901.

The ''Waffen-SS'' had no field marshals, but the rank of ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' held by [[Heinrich Himmler]] was considered to be the equivalent of a field marshal (''Generalfeldmarschall'') during the war years.<ref>McNab, Chris (2009), ''The SS'', Amber Books Ltd., p. 30. {{ISBN|978-1-906626-49-5}}</ref>\n\nThe [[senior colonel]] rank of ''SS-[[Oberf\u00fchrer]]'' has sometimes been considered to be a brigadier general equivalent; however, this is incorrect. The rank (in particular among the ''Waffen-SS'') was not considered equivalent to a general officer, was not entitled to the grey [[lampasse]]s and lapel facings of a general, and wore the shoulderboards of an army [[Colonel|full-colonel]] or ''Oberst''.<ref>Yerger, Mark C.

While the rank titles of ''Generalmajor'', ''Generalleutnant'' and ''General'' were retained, each of those titles now denotes a higher rank than before (e.g. the ''Generalleutnant'' is now a three-star general).\n\nPrior to the [[reunification of Germany]], general officer rank designations in the [[German Democratic Republic]] were based on the Soviet model. ''Generalmajor'' was still the lowest general officer grade, followed by ''Generalleutnant'', ''Generaloberst'' (now three stars instead of four) and ''[[Armeegeneral]]''. In 1982, the GDR government established the rank of ''[[Marshal of the German Democratic Republic|Marschall der DDR]]'', although no one was ever promoted to this rank.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparative military ranks of World War I]]\n* [[Comparative military ranks of World War II]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Military ranks of Germany]]\n\n[[de:General]]\n", "name_user": "Mazbel", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:COA Luftwaffe eagle gold right.svg\u2192File:COA Luftwaffe eagle gold (looking left).svgCriterion 3(obvious error) \u00b7 Die Sichtbeschreibung erfolgt immer vom Tragenden / der Figur", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_(Germany)"}

As many farmers in the Ethiopian highlands grow their own subsistence grains, [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[Maize|corn]], or [[rice]] flour are sometimes used to replace some or all of the teff content.

Debre Markos, Ethiopia.]]\nTo make injera, teff flour is mixed with water. The fermentation process is triggered by adding ersho, a clear, yellow liquid that accumulates on the surface of fermenting teff flour batter and is collected from previous fermentations. Ersho contains (aerobic) ''Bacillus'' species and several yeasts (in order of abundance): ''Candida milleri'', ''Rhodotorula mucilaginosa'', ''Kluyveromyces marxianus'', ''Pichia naganishii'' and ''Debaromyces hansenii''.<ref name=\"World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology, 1994, Volume 10, Issue 1, pp 69\u201373\">{{cite journal |last1=Ashenafi |first1=M. |title=Microbial flora and some chemical properties of ersho, a starter for teff (Eragrostis tef) fermentation |journal=World Journal of Microbiology & Biotechnology |volume=10 |pages=69\u201373 |doi=10.1007/BF00357567 |pmid=24420890 |year=1994 }}</ref> <ref name=\":3\" /> The mixture is then allowed to [[Fermentation (food)|ferment]] for an average of two to three days, giving it a mildly sour taste. The injera is [[Baking|baked]] into large, flat [[pancake]]s.

In taste and texture, it is more similar to the South Indian ''[[appam]]''.

As many farmers in the Ethiopian highlands grow their own subsistence grains, [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[Maize|corn]], or [[rice]] flour are sometimes used to replace some or all of the teff content.

Debre Markos, Ethiopia.]]\nTo make injera, teff flour is mixed with water. The fermentation process is triggered by adding ersho, a clear, yellow liquid that accumulates on the surface of fermenting teff flour batter and is collected from previous fermentations. Ersho contains (aerobic) ''Bacillus'' species and several yeasts (in order of abundance): ''Candida milleri'', ''Rhodotorula mucilaginosa'', ''Kluyveromyces marxianus'', ''Pichia naganishii'' and ''Debaromyces hansenii''.<ref name=\"World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology, 1994, Volume 10, Issue 1, pp 69\u201373\">{{cite journal |last1=Ashenafi |first1=M. |title=Microbial flora and some chemical properties of ersho, a starter for teff (Eragrostis tef) fermentation |journal=World Journal of Microbiology & Biotechnology |volume=10 |pages=69\u201373 |doi=10.1007/BF00357567 |pmid=24420890 |year=1994 }}</ref> <ref name=\":3\" /> The mixture is then allowed to [[Fermentation (food)|ferment]] for an average of two to three days, giving it a mildly sour taste. The injera is [[Baking|baked]] into large, flat [[pancake]]s.

In taste and texture, it is more similar to the South Indian ''[[appam]]''. The bottom surface of the injera, which touches the heating surface, has a relatively smooth texture, while the top is porous. This porous texture makes injera good for scooping up sauces and dishes.\n\n=== Ingredients ===\nTraditionally, injera is made with just two ingredients \u2013 ''[[Eragrostis tef]]'', also known as teff, an ancient grain from the [[highlands of Ethiopia]],<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Jones| first = Wilbert| date = 2010| title = A Taste of Ethiopian Cuisine| url = | journal = Computers & Applied Sciences Complete| pages = 55\u201356}}</ref> and water.

''Mitads'' have been found at archaeological sites dating back as far as 600 AD.<ref name=\":1\" /> Nowadays, ''mitads'' are no longer always made out of clay, but can also be electric.\n\nTraditional clay stoves can be inefficient in that they consume large amounts of firewood and produce a lot of smoke, creating household pollution and making them dangerous to use around children.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Diehl|first=Jan Carel|last2=Jones|first2=Robin|last3=Verwaal|first3=Martin|date=2017-05-04|chapter=The Development of an Energy Efficient Electric Mitad for Baking Injeras in Ethiopia|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315787267|doi=10.23919/DUE.2017.7931827|title=2017 International Conference on the Domestic Use of Energy (DUE)|pages=75\u201382|isbn=978-0-9946759-2-7|url=http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:0b7d8d39-7742-4877-8a39-5e598daa1fed}}</ref> In 2003, an Eritrean research group designed a stove for cooking injera and other foods that uses more easily available fuel, such as twigs instead of large branches, crop residues and dung, locally called ''kubet''.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web\n| url=https://www.ashden.org/winners/rec-formerly-ertc\n| title=Ashden awards: REC (formerly ERTC), Eritrea \u2013 Local construction of efficient stoves\n| publisher=[[Ashden]]\n| date=2003\n| accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> Several parts of this new stove are made in the central cities of Ethiopia and Eritrea, while other parts are moulded from clay by women in local areas.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[File:Ethiopia Gheralta WomanCookingInjera.JPG|thumb|Woman checking the baking of an injera in her house.

Since \"Luft\" translates into English as \"air\", and \"Waffe\" may be translated into English as either [[weapon|\"weapon\" or \"arm\"]], \"Air Arm\" may be considered the most literal English translation of ''Luftwaffe'' (cf.

[[German Empire|Germany]]'s military air arms during [[World War I]], the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' of the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial Army]] and the ''[[Marineflieger|Marine-Fliegerabteilung]]'' of the [[Imperial German Navy|Imperial Navy]], had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.\n\nDuring the interwar period, German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at [[Lipetsk Air Base]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty, the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935, just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through [[German re-armament]] and conscription would be announced on 16 March.<ref>{{harvnb|Fischer|1995|p=408}}</ref> The [[Condor Legion]], a ''Luftwaffe'' detachment sent to aid [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War]], provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft. Partially as a result of this combat experience, the ''Luftwaffe'' had become one of the most sophisticated, technologically advanced, and battle-experienced air forces in the world when [[World War II]] broke out in 1939.<ref>{{harvnb|Killen|2003|p=93}}</ref> By the summer of 1939, the ''Luftwaffe'' had twenty-eight ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe during World War II#Types of Geschwader|Geschwader]]'' [[Wing (military aviation unit)|(wings)]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' also operated ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' [[paratrooper]] units.\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and [[Battle of France|Western Europe]] in 1939 and 1940. During the [[Battle of Britain]], however, despite inflicting severe damage to the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]'s infrastructure and, during [[The Blitz|the subsequent Blitz]], devastating many British cities, the German air force failed to batter the beleaguered British into submission. From 1942, Allied bombing campaigns gradually destroyed the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s fighter arm. From late 1942, the ''Luftwaffe'' used its surplus ground support and other personnel to raise [[Luftwaffe Field Division|''Luftwaffe'' Field Divisions]]. In addition to its service in [[Western Front (World War II)|the West]], the ''Luftwaffe'' operated over the Soviet Union, North Africa and Southern Europe. Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket propelled aircraft for [[bomber destroyer|the destruction of Allied bombers]], the ''Luftwaffe'' was overwhelmed by the Allies' superior numbers and improved tactics, and a lack of trained pilots and aviation fuel. In January 1945, during the closing stages of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the ''Luftwaffe'' [[Operation Bodenplatte|made a last-ditch effort to win air superiority]], and met with failure. With rapidly dwindling supplies of [[Oil Campaign of World War II|petroleum, oil, and lubricants]] after this campaign, and as part of the entire combined ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' military forces as a whole, the ''Luftwaffe'' ceased to be an effective fighting force.\n\nAfter the defeat of Germany, the ''Luftwaffe'' was disbanded in 1946. During World War II, German pilots claimed roughly 70,000 aerial victories, while over 75,000 ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft were destroyed or significantly damaged. Of these, nearly 40,000 were lost entirely. The ''Luftwaffe'' had only two commanders-in-chief throughout its history: [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and later ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Robert Ritter von Greim]] for the last two weeks of the war.\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' was deeply involved in [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|Nazi war crimes]]. By the end of the war, a significant percentage of aircraft production originated in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], an industry employing tens of thousands of prisoners.{{refn|group=N|name=production}} The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s demand for labor was one of the factors that led to the deportation and murder of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews in 1944. The ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'' organized [[Nazi human experimentation]], and ''Luftwaffe'' ground troops committed massacres in [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and [[Poland]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n{{main|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte|Aviation in World War I}}\n<!----[[File:Greek cross.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|Emblem of the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' from March/April 1918 to the Armistice.]]---->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0430-501, Jagdstaffel 11, Manfred v. Richthofen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manfred von Richthofen]] with other members of ''[[Jasta 11]]'', 1917 as part of the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'']]\nThe Imperial German Army Air Service was founded in 1910 with the name ''Die Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches'', most often shortened to ''Fliegertruppe''. It was renamed the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' on 8 October 1916.<ref>{{harvnb|Blumberg|2014|p=39}}</ref> The air war on the Western Front received the most attention in the annals of the earliest accounts of military aviation, since it produced aces such as [[Manfred von Richthofen]] and [[Ernst Udet]], [[Oswald Boelcke]], and [[Max Immelmann]]. After the defeat of Germany, the service was dissolved on 8 May 1920 under the conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which also mandated the destruction of all German military aircraft.\n\nSince the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to have an air force, German pilots trained in secret. Initially, civil aviation schools within Germany were used, yet only light [[trainer (aircraft)|trainers]] could be used in order to maintain the fa\u00e7ade that the trainees were going to fly with civil airlines such as [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]]. To train its pilots on the latest combat aircraft, Germany solicited the help of the [[Soviet Union]], which was also isolated in Europe. A [[Fighter pilot school Lipetsk|secret training airfield was established at Lipetsk]] in 1924 and operated for approximately nine years using mostly Dutch and Soviet, but also some German, training aircraft before being closed in 1933. This base was officially known as 4th squadron of the 40th wing of the Red Army. Hundreds of ''Luftwaffe'' pilots and technical personnel visited, studied and were trained at Soviet air force schools in several locations in Central Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Stein|1962|pp=54\u201371}}</ref> Roessing, Blume, Fosse, Teetsemann, Heini, Makratzki, Blumendaat, and many other future ''Luftwaffe'' aces were trained in Russia in joint Russian-German schools that were set up under the patronage of [[Ernst August K\u00f6string]].\n\nThe first steps towards the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s formation were undertaken just months after [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], a [[World War I]] ace, became National ''Kommissar'' for aviation with former Luft Hansa director [[Erhard Milch]] as his deputy. In April 1933 the [[Reich Aviation Ministry]] (''Reichsluftfahrtministerium'' or RLM) was established. The RLM was in charge of development and production of aircraft. G\u00f6ring's control over all aspects of aviation became absolute. On 25 March 1933 the [[German Air Sports Association]] absorbed all private and national organizations, while retaining its 'sports' title. On 15 May 1933, all military aviation organizations in the RLM were merged, forming the ''Luftwaffe''; its official 'birthday'.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=30}}</ref> The [[National Socialist Flyers Corps]] (''Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps'' or NSFK) was formed in 1937 to give pre-military flying training to male youths, and to engage adult sport aviators in the Nazi movement. Military-age members of the NSFK were drafted into the ''Luftwaffe''. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members, this gave the new ''Luftwaffe'' a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|''Heer'']] (Army) and the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (Navy)). G\u00f6ring played a leading role in the buildup of the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1933\u201336, but had little further involvement in the development of the force after 1936, and Milch became the \"de facto\" minister until 1937.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=31}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of G\u00f6ring in planning and production matters was fortunate. G\u00f6ring had little knowledge of current aviation, had last flown in 1922, and had not kept himself informed of latest events. G\u00f6ring also displayed a lack of understanding of doctrine and technical issues in aerial warfare which he left to others more competent. The Commander-in-Chief left the organisation and building of the ''Luftwaffe'', after 1936, to Erhard Milch. However G\u00f6ring, as a part of Hitler's inner circle, provided access to financial resources and materiel for rearming and equipping the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|pp=124\u2013125}}</ref>\n\nAnother prominent figure in German air power construction this time was [[Helmuth Wilberg]]. Wilberg later played a large role in the development of German air doctrine. Having headed the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' air staff for eight years in the 1920s, Wilberg had considerable experience and was ideal for a senior staff position.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=125}}</ref> G\u00f6ring considered making Wilberg [[Chief of Staff]] (CS). However, it was revealed Wilberg had a Jewish mother. For that reason G\u00f6ring could not have him as CS. Not wishing his talent to go to waste, G\u00f6ring ensured the racial laws of the Third Reich did not apply to him. Wilberg remained in the air staff, and under [[Walther Wever (general)|Walther Wever]] helped draw up the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s principle doctrinal texts, \"The Conduct of the Aerial War\" and \"Regulation 16\".<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=127}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2010|pp=20\u201321}}</ref>\n\n===Preparing for war: 1933\u201339===\n====Wever years, 1933\u201336====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-1941, Walther Wever.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Walther Wever (general)|Walther Wever]], Chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' General Staff, 1933\u20131936]]\n\nThe German officer Corps was keen to develop [[strategic bombing]] capabilities against its enemies. However, economic and geopolitical considerations had to take priority. The German air power theorists continued to develop strategic theories, but emphasis was given to army support, as Germany was a continental power and expected to face ground operations following any declaration of hostilities.<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=1}}</ref>\n\nFor these reasons, between 1933 and 1934, the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s leadership was primarily concerned with tactical and operational methods. In aerial terms, the army concept of ''[[Truppenf\u00fchrung]]'' was an operational concept, as well as a tactical doctrine. In World War I, the ''Fliegertruppe's'' initial, 1914\u201315 era ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' observation/reconnaissance air units, each with six two-seater aircraft apiece, had been attached to specific army formations and acted as support. [[Dive bomber]] units were considered essential to ''Truppenf\u00fchrung'', attacking enemy headquarters and lines of communications.<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 129\">{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=129}}</ref> ''Luftwaffe'' \"Regulation 10: The Bomber\" (''Dienstvorschrift 10: Das Kampfflugzeug''), published in 1934, advocated air superiority and approaches to ground attack tactics without dealing with operational matters. Until 1935, the 1926 manual \"Directives for the Conduct of the Operational Air War\" continued to act as the main guide for German air operations. The manual directed OKL to focus on limited operations (not strategic operations): the protection of specific areas and support of the army in combat.<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 129\"/>\n\nWith an effective tactical-operational concept,<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=130}}</ref> the German air power theorists needed a strategic doctrine and organisation. Robert Knauss, a serviceman (not pilot) in the ''Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte'' during World War I, and later an experienced pilot with Lufthansa,<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=132}}</ref> was a prominent theorist of air power. Knauss promoted the [[Giulio Douhet]] theory that air power could win wars alone by destroying enemy industry and breaking enemy morale by \"terrorizing the population\" of major cities. This advocated attacks on civilians.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=133}}</ref> The General Staff blocked the entry of Douhet's theory into doctrine, fearing revenge strikes against German civilians and cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|pp=133\u2013134}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1934, Chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' [[General Staff]] [[Walther Wever (general)|Walther Wever]] sought to mould the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s battle doctrine into a strategic plan. At this time, Wever conducted war games (simulated against France) in a bid to establish his theory of a strategic bombing force that would, he thought, prove decisive by winning the war through the destruction of enemy industry, even though these exercises also included tactical strikes against enemy ground forces and communications. In 1935, \"''Luftwaffe'' Regulation 16: The Conduct of the Air War\" was drawn up. In the proposal, it concluded, \"The mission of the ''Luftwaffe'' is to serve these goals.\"<ref name=\"Hooton 2007, ''Luftwaffe at War: Gathering Storm'', p. 34\">{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=34}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2010|p=28}}</ref>\n\nCorum states that under this doctrine, the ''Luftwaffe'' leadership rejected the practice of \"[[terror bombing]]\" (see [[Blitzkrieg#Luftwaffe doctrine|''Luftwaffe'' strategic bombing doctrine]]).<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 7\">{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=7}}</ref> According to Corum terror bombing was deemed to be \"counter-productive\", increasing rather than destroying the enemy's will to resist.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|pp=143\u2013144}}</ref> Such bombing campaigns were regarded as diversion from the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s main operations; destruction of the enemy armed forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=146}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Wever recognised the importance of [[strategic bombing]]. In newly introduced doctrine, ''The Conduct of the Aerial Air War'' in 1935, Wever rejected the theory of Douhet<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=143}}</ref> and outlined five key points to air strategy:<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=138}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n#To destroy the enemy air force by bombing its bases and aircraft factories, and defeating enemy air forces attacking German targets.\n#To prevent the movement of large enemy ground forces to the decisive areas by destroying railways and roads, particularly bridges and tunnels, which are indispensable for the movement and supply of forces\n#To support the operations of the army formations, independent of railways, i.e, armoured forces and motorised forces, by impeding the enemy advance and participating directly in ground operations.\n#To support naval operations by attacking naval bases, protecting Germany's naval bases and participating directly in naval battles\n#To paralyse the enemy armed forces by stopping production in the armaments factories.\n</blockquote>\n\nWever began planning for a strategic bomber force and sought to incorporate strategic bombing into a war strategy. He believed that tactical aircraft should only be used as a step to developing a strategic air force. In May 1934, Wever initiated a seven-year project to develop the so-called \"[[Ural bomber]]\", which could strike as far as into the heart of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1935, this design competition led to the [[Dornier Do 19]] and [[Junkers Ju 89]] prototypes, although both were underpowered. In April 1936, Wever issue requirements for the 'Bomber A' design competition: a range of 6,700&nbsp;km (4,163&nbsp;mi) with a 900&nbsp;kg (1,984&nbsp;lb) bomb load. However Wever's vision of a \"Ural\" bomber was never realised,<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=33}}</ref> and his emphasis on strategic aerial operations was lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=224}}</ref> The only design submittal for Wever's 'Bomber A' that reached production was [[Heinkel]]'s ''Projekt 1041'', which culminated in the production and frontline service as Germany's only operational heavy bomber, the [[Heinkel He 177]], on 5 November 1937, the date on which it received its [[List of RLM aircraft designations#101-200|RLM airframe number]].{{sfn|Griehl|Dressel1998|p=9}}\n\nIn 1935, the military functions of the RLM were grouped into ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'' (OKL; \"Air Force High Command\").\n\nFollowing the untimely death of Walther Wever in early June 1936 in an [[Gust lock#Safety|aviation-related accident]], by the late 1930s the ''Luftwaffe'' had no clear purpose. The air force was not subordinated to the army support role, and it was not given any particular strategic mission. German doctrine fell between the two concepts. The ''Luftwaffe'' was to be an organization capable of carrying out broad and general support tasks rather than any specific mission. Mainly, this path was chosen to encourage a more flexible use of air power and offer the ground forces the right conditions for a decisive victory. In fact, on the outbreak of war, only 15% of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s aircraft were devoted to ground support operations, counter to the long-held myth that the ''Luftwaffe'' was designed for only tactical and operational missions.<ref>{{harvnb|Buckley|1998|pp=85\u201386}}</ref>\n\n====Change of direction, 1936\u201337====\nWever's participation in the construction of the ''Luftwaffe'' came to an abrupt end on 3 June 1936 when he was killed along with his engineer in a [[Heinkel He 70]] Blitz, ironically on the very day that his \"Bomber A\" heavy bomber design competition was announced. After Wever's death G\u00f6ring began taking more of an interest in the appointment of ''Luftwaffe'' staff officers. G\u00f6ring appointed his successor [[Albert Kesselring]] as Chief of Staff and [[Ernst Udet]] to head the Reich's Air Ministry Technical Office (''Technisches Amt''), although he was not a technical expert. Despite this Udet helped change the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s tactical direction towards fast medium bombers to destroy enemy air power in the battle zone rather than through industrial bombing of its aviation production.<ref name=\"Hooton 2007, ''Luftwaffe at War: Gathering Storm'', p. 34\"/>\n\nKesselring and Udet did not get on. During Kesselring's time as CS, 1936\u20131937, a power struggle developed between the two as Udet attempted to extend his own power within the ''Luftwaffe''. Kesselring also had to contend with G\u00f6ring appointing \"yes men\" to positions of importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=225}}</ref> Udet realised his limitations, and his failures in the production and development of German aircraft would have serious long term consequences.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=227}}</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1984-112-13, Ernst Udet.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Ernst Udet]]. Along with Albert Kesselring, Udet was responsible for establishing the design trend of German aircraft. Udet's focus was on tactical army support air forces]]\n\nThe failure of the ''Luftwaffe'' to progress further towards attaining a strategic bombing force was attributable to several reasons. Many in the ''Luftwaffe'' command believed medium bombers to be sufficient power to launch strategic bombing operations against Germany's most likely enemies; France, [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Poland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=10}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom]] presented greater problems. ''[[General der Flieger]]'' [[Hellmuth Felmy]], commander of ''[[Luftflotte 2]]'' in 1939, was charged with devising a plan for an air war over the British Isles. Felmy was convinced that Britain could be defeated through morale bombing. Felmy noted the alleged panic that had broken out in London during the [[Munich crisis]], evidence he believed of British weakness. A second reason was technical. German designers had never solved the issues of the [[Heinkel He 177]]A's design difficulties, brought on by the requirement from its inception on 5 November 1937 to have moderate dive bombing capabilities in a 30-meter wingspan aircraft. Moreover, Germany did not possess the economic resources to match the later British and American effort of 1943\u20131944, particularly in large-scale mass production of [[Bomber B#High-output aviation engines for the Luftwaffe|high power output aircraft engines]] (with output of over least 1,500&nbsp;kW (2,000&nbsp;hp). In addition, OKL had not foreseen the industrial and military effort strategic bombing would require. By 1939 the ''Luftwaffe'' was not much better prepared than its enemies to conduct a strategic bombing campaign,<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=11}}</ref> with fatal results during the [[Battle of Britain]].<ref>{{harvnb|Overy|1980|p=31}}</ref>\n\nThe German rearmament program faced difficulties acquiring raw materials. Germany imported most of its essential materials for rebuilding the ''Luftwaffe'', in particular rubber and aluminium. Petroleum imports were particularly vulnerable to blockade. Germany pushed for synthetic fuel plants, but still failed to meet demands. In 1937 Germany imported more fuel than it had at the start of the decade. By the summer 1938 only 25% of requirements could be covered. In steel materials, industry was operating at barely 83% of capacity, and by November 1938 G\u00f6ring reported the economic situation was serious.<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=2}}</ref> The ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (OKW), the overall command for all German military forces, ordered reductions in raw materials and steel used for armament production. The figures for reduction were substantial: 30% steel, 20% copper, 47% aluminium, and 14% rubber.<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=3}}</ref> Under such circumstances, it was not possible for Milch, Udet, or Kesselring to produce a formidable strategic bombing force even had they wanted to do so.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe development of aircraft was now confined to the production of twin-engined medium bombers that required much less material, manpower and aviation production capacity than Wever's \"Ural Bomber\". German industry could build two medium bombers for one heavy bomber and the RLM would not gamble on developing a heavy bomber which would also take time. G\u00f6ring remarked, \"the ''F\u00fchrer'' will not ask how big the bombers there are, but only how many there are.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Homze|1976|p=125}}</ref> The premature death of Wever, one of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s finest officers, left the ''Luftwaffe'' without a strategic air force during World War II, which eventually proved fatal to the German war effort.<ref name=\"Hooton 2007, ''Luftwaffe at War: Gathering Storm'', p. 34\"/>{{sfn|Dressel|Griehl|1994|p= 176}}<ref>{{harvnb|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007|pp=129\u2013130}}</ref>\n\nThe lack of strategic capability should have been apparent much earlier. The [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Sudeten Crisis]] highlighted German unpreparedness to conduct a strategic air war (although the British and French were in a much weaker position), and Hitler ordered the ''Luftwaffe'' be expanded to five times its earlier size.{{sfn|Ketley|Rolfe|1996|p=3}} OKL badly neglected the need for transport aircraft; even in 1943, transport units were described as ''Kampfgeschwadern zur besonderen Verwendung'' (Bomber Units on Special Duties, KGzbV).{{sfn|Ketley|Rolfe|1996|p=7}} and only grouping them together into dedicated cargo and personnel transport wings (''Transportgeschwader'') during that year. In March 1938, as the ''[[Anschluss]]'' was taking place, G\u00f6ring ordered Felmy to investigate the prospect of air raids against Britain. Felmy concluded it was not possible until bases in [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] were obtained and the ''Luftwaffe'' had heavy bombers. It mattered little, as war was avoided by the Munich Agreement, and the need for long-range aircraft did not arise.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=77}}</ref>\n\nThese failures were not exposed until wartime. In the meantime German designs of mid-1930s origin such as the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], [[Heinkel He 111]], [[Junkers Ju 87]] Stuka, and [[Dornier Do 17]], performed very well. All first saw active service in the [[Condor Legion]] against Soviet-supplied aircraft. The ''Luftwaffe'' also quickly realized the days of the biplane fighter were finished, the [[Heinkel He 51]] being switched to service as a trainer. Particularly impressive were the Heinkel and Dornier, which fulfilled the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s requirements for bombers that were faster than 1930s-era fighters, many of which were biplanes or strut-braced monoplanes.\n\nDespite the participation of these aircraft (mainly from 1938 onward), it was the venerable [[Junkers Ju 52]] (which soon became the backbone of the ''Transportgruppen'') that made the main contribution. During the Spanish Civil War Hitler remarked, \"Franco ought to erect a monument to the glory of the Junkers Ju 52. It is the aircraft which the Spanish revolution has to thank for its victory.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=51}}</ref>\n\n====Dive-bombing====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-646-5188-17, Flugzeuge Junkers Ju 87.jpg|thumb|right|[[Junkers Ju 87]] Ds over the Eastern Front, winter 1943\u201344]]\nPoor accuracy from level bombers in 1937 led the ''Luftwaffe'' to grasp the benefits of dive-bombing. The latter could achieve far better accuracy against tactical ground targets than heavier conventional bombers. Range was not a key criterion for this mission. It was not always feasible for the army to move heavy artillery over recently captured territory to bombard fortifications or support ground forces, and dive bombers could do the job faster. Dive bombers, often single-engine two-man machines, could achieve better results than larger six or seven-man aircraft, at a tenth of the cost and four times the accuracy. This led to Udet championing the dive bomber, particularly the [[Junkers Ju 87]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=38}}</ref>\n\nUdet's \"love affair\" with dive bombing seriously affected the long-term development of the ''Luftwaffe'', especially after General Wever's death. The tactical strike aircraft programs were meant to serve as interim solutions until the next generation of aircraft arrived. In 1936 the [[Junkers Ju 52]] was the backbone of the German bomber fleet. This led to a rush on the part of the RLM to produce the [[Junkers Ju 86]], [[Heinkel He 111]], and [[Dornier Do 17]] before a proper evaluation was made. The Ju 86 was poor while the He 111 showed most promise. The [[Spanish Civil War]] convinced Udet (along with limited output from the German munitions industry) that wastage was not acceptable in munition terms. Udet sought to build dive bombing into the [[Junkers Ju 88]] and conveyed the same idea, initiated specifically by OKL for the [[Heinkel He 177]], approved in early November 1937. In the case of the Ju 88, 50,000 modifications had to be made. The weight was increased from seven to twelve tons. This resulted in a speed loss of 200&nbsp;km/h. Udet merely conveyed OKL's own dive bombing capability request to [[Ernst Heinkel]] concerning the He 177, who vehemently opposed such an idea, which ruined its development as a heavy bomber.<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=14}}</ref> G\u00f6ring was not able to rescind the dive bombing requirement for the He 177A until September 1942.{{sfn|Griehl|Dressel|1998|p= 53}}\n\n====Mobilization, 1938\u201341====\nBy the summer of 1939, the ''Luftwaffe'' had ready for combat nine ''Jagdgeschwader'' (fighter wings) mostly equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, four '''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe during World War II#Types of Geschwader|Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader]]'' (destroyer wings) equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter, 11 ''[[Kampfgeschwader]]'' (bomber wings) equipped mainly with the Heinkel He 111 and the Dornier Do 17Z, and four ''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' (dive bomber wing\") primarily armed with the iconic [[Junkers Ju 87]]B ''Stuka''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=79}}</ref> The ''Luftwaffe'' was just starting to accept the [[Junkers Ju 88]]A for service, as it had encountered design difficulties, with only a dozen aircraft of the type considered combat-ready. The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s strength at this time stood at 373,000 personnel (208,000 flying troops, 107,000 in the Flak Corps and 58,000 in the Signals Corps). Aircraft strength was 4,201 operational aircraft: 1,191 bombers, 361 dive bombers, 788 fighters, 431 heavy fighters, and 488 transports. Despite deficiencies it was an impressive force.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=271}}</ref>\n[[File:Polish victim of German Luftwaffe action 1939.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Polish girl lying dead after being strafed by German dive bombers, September 1939]]\n\nHowever, even by the spring of 1940, the ''Luftwaffe'' still had not mobilized fully. Despite the shortage of raw-materials, ''Generalluftzeugmeister'' Ernst Udet had increased production through introducing a 10-hour working day for aviation industries and rationalizing production. During this period 30 ''Kampfstaffeln'' and 16 ''Jagdstaffeln'' were raised and equipped. A further five ''Zerst\u00f6rergruppen'' (\"Destroyer groups\") were created (JGr 101, 102,126,152 and 176), all equipped with the Bf 110.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=23}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' also greatly expanded its aircrew training programs by 42%, to 63 flying schools. These facilities were moved to eastern Germany, away from possible Allied threats. The number of aircrew reached 4,727, an increase of 31%. However, the rush to complete this rapid expansion scheme resulted in the deaths of 997 personnel and another 700 wounded. 946 aircraft were also destroyed in these accidents. The number of aircrew completing their training was up to 3,941, The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s entire strength was now 2.2&nbsp;million personnel.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=24}}</ref>\n\nIn April and May 1941, Udet headed the ''Luftwaffe'' delegation inspecting Soviet aviation industry in compliance with the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]].

As the war progressed more air fleets were created as the areas under German rule expanded. As one example, [[Luftflotte 5|''Luftflotte'' 5]] was created in 1940 to direct operations in Norway and Denmark, and other ''Luftflotten'' were created as necessary. Each ''Luftflotte'' would contain several ''Fliegerkorps'' (Air Corps), ''Fliegerdivision'' (Air Division), ''Jagdkorps'' (Fighter Corps),''Jagddivision'' (Air Division) or ''Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer'' (Fighter Air Command). Each formations would have attached to it a number of units, usually several ''Geschwader'', but also independent ''Staffeln'' and ''[[Kampfgruppen]]''.<ref name=\"Luftwaffe Tactical Organisation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.feldgrau.com/luftorg.html|title=High Command of the Luftwaffe|work=feldgrau.com|access-date=26 September 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170617140838/http://www.feldgrau.com/WW2-German-Luftwaffe-High-Command|archive-date=17 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Luftflotten'' were also responsible for the training aircraft and schools in their operational areas.<ref name=\"Ketley and Rolfe, p. 4\">{{harvnb|Ketley|Rolfe |1996|p=4}}</ref>\n\nA ''Geschwader'' was commanded by a ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'', with the [[Military rank|rank]] of either major, ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' ([[lieutenant colonel]]) or ''[[Oberst]]'' ([[colonel]]). Other \"staff\" officers within the unit with administrative duties included the adjutant, technical officer, and operations officer, who were usually (though not always) experienced aircrew or pilots still flying on operations. Other specialist staff were navigation, signals, and intelligence personnel. A ''Stabschwarm'' (headquarters [[Flight (military unit)|flight]]) was attached to each ''Geschwader''.<ref name=\"Luftwaffe Tactical Organisation\"/>\n\nA ''Jagdgeschwader'' (hunting wing) (JG) was a single-seat day fighter ''Geschwader'', typically equipped with Bf 109 or Fw 190 aircraft flying in the fighter or fighter-bomber roles. Late in the war, by 1944\u201345, [[JG 7]] and [[JG 400]] (and the jet specialist [[JV 44]]) flew much more advanced aircraft, with [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|JG 1]] [[Heinkel He 162|working up with jets]] at war's end. A ''Geschwader'' consisted of groups (''Gruppen''), which in turn consisted of ''Jagdstaffel'' (fighter squadrons). Hence, Fighter Wing 1 was JG 1, its first ''Gruppe'' (group) was I./JG 1, using a [[Roman numeral]] for the ''Gruppe'' number only, and its first ''Staffel'' (squadron) was 1./JG 1. ''Geschwader'' strength was usually 120 \u2013 125 aircraft.<ref name=\"Luftwaffe Tactical Organisation\"/>\n\nEach ''Gruppe'' was commanded by a ''Kommandeur'', and a ''Staffel'' by a ''Staffelkapit\u00e4n''. However, these were \"appointments\", not ranks, within the ''Luftwaffe''. Usually, the ''Kommodore'' would hold the rank of ''Oberstleutnant'' (lieutenant colonel) or, exceptionally, an ''Oberst'' (colonel). Even a ''Leutnant'' (second lieutenant) could find himself commanding a ''Staffel''.\n\nSimilarly, a bomber wing was a ''Kampfgeschwader'' (KG), a night fighter wing was a ''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' (NJG), a dive bomber wing was a ''Stukageschwader'' (StG), and units equivalent to those in RAF Coastal Command, with specific responsibilities for coastal patrols and search and rescue duties, were ''K\u00fcstenfliegergruppen'' (K\u00fc.Fl.

It was not until 1942 that the Germans started to develop bombing policy in which civilians were the primary target, although [[The Blitz]] on London and many other British cities involved indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas,<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 7\"/> 'nuisance raids' which could even involve the machine-gunning of civilians and livestock.<ref>{{harvnb|Neitzel|Weltzer|2012|pp=57\u201358}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWhen World War II began, the ''Luftwaffe'' was one of the most technologically advanced air forces in the world. During the [[Polish Campaign]] that triggered the war, it quickly established air superiority, and then air supremacy. It supported the German Army operations which ended the campaign in five weeks. The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s performance was as OKL had hoped. The ''Luftwaffe'' rendered invaluable support to the army,<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007b|p=93}}</ref> mopping up pockets of resistance. G\u00f6ring was delighted with the performance.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007b|p=91}}</ref> Command and control problems were experienced, but owing to the flexibility and improvisation of both the army and ''Luftwaffe'', these problems were solved. The ''Luftwaffe'' was to have in place a ground-to-air communication system, which played a vital role in the success of ''[[Fall Gelb]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Buckley|1998|p=127}}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1940, the ''Luftwaffe'' assisted the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and ''Heer'' in the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|invasion of Norway]]. Flying in reinforcements and winning air superiority, the ''Luftwaffe'' contributed decisively to the German conquest.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|pp=274\u2013275}}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1940, the ''Luftwaffe'' contributed to the unexpected success in the [[Battle of France]]. It destroyed three Allied Air Forces and helped secure the defeat of France in just over six weeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|pp=275\u2013277}}</ref> However, it could not [[Battle of Dunkirk|destroy the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk]] despite intense bombing.

H. G. McArthur, hitting a [[Heinkel He 111]] on its starboard quarter]]\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Britain]] in summer 1940, the ''Luftwaffe'' inflicted severe damage to the [[Royal Air Force]], but did not achieve the air superiority that Hitler demanded for [[Operation Sea Lion|the proposed invasion of Britain]], which was postponed and then cancelled in December 1940.<ref>{{harvnb|Killen|2003|p=149}}</ref> The ''Luftwaffe'' ravaged British cities during [[The Blitz]], but failed to break British morale. Hitler had already ordered preparations to be made for [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nIn spring 1941, the ''Luftwaffe'' helped its [[Axis powers|Axis]] partner, Italy, secure victory in the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]] and continued to support Italy in the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres]] until May 1945.\n\nIn June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The ''Luftwaffe'' destroyed thousands of Soviet aircraft, yet it failed to destroy the [[Red Air Force]] altogether. Lacking strategic bombers (the very \"Ural bombers\" that General Wever had asked for six years before) the ''Luftwaffe'' could not strike at Soviet production centers regularly or with the needed force.<ref>{{harvnb|Killen|2003|pp=171\u2013184}}</ref> As the war dragged on, the ''Luftwaffe'' was eroded in strength. The defeats at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and [[Battle of Kursk]] ensured the gradual decline of the ''Wehrmacht'' on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\nBritish historian [[Frederick Taylor (historian)|Frederick Taylor]] asserts that \"all sides bombed each other's cities during the war. Half a million [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens, for example, died from German [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]] during the invasion and occupation of Russia.

The mounting demands of the [[Defence of the Reich]] campaign gradually destroyed the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s fighter arm. Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket propelled aircraft for bomber destroyer duties, it was overwhelmed by Allied numbers and a lack of trained pilots and fuel. A last-ditch attempt, known as [[Operation Bodenplatte]], to win air superiority on 1 January 1945 failed. After the ''Bodenplatte'' effort, the ''Luftwaffe'' ceased to be an effective fighting force.\n\nGerman day and night fighter pilots claimed more than 70,000 aerial victories during World War II.<ref>{{harvnb|Dierich|1976|p=35}}</ref> Of these, about 745 victories are estimated to be achieved by [[Messerschmitt Me 262|jet fighters]].<ref>Hugh Morgan, John Weal, German Jet Aces of World War 2, Osprey Aircraft of the Aces No 17, Osprey Publishing, London 1998, p. 78</ref> [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Flak]] shot down 25,000\u201330,000 Allied planes.

The most successful night fighter pilot was [[Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer]], who is credited with 121 kills. 103 German fighter pilots shot down more than 100 enemy aircraft for a total of roughly 15,400 aerial victories. Roughly a further 360 pilots claimed between 40 and 100 aerial victories for round about 21,000 victories. Another 500 fighter pilots claimed between 20 and 40 victories for a total of 15,000 victories.

The ''Luftwaffe'' lacked an effective air defence system early in the war. [[Adolf Hitler]]'s foreign policy had pushed Germany into war before these defences could be fully developed. The ''Luftwaffe'' was forced to improvise and construct its defences during the war.\n\nThe daylight actions over German controlled territory were sparse in 1939\u20131940. The responsibility of the defence of German air space fell to the ''Luftgaukommandos'' (air district commands). The defence systems relied mostly on the \"flak\" arm. The defences were not coordinated and communication was poor. This lack of understanding between the flak and flying branches of the defence would plague the ''Luftwaffe'' throughout the war.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 42\">{{harvnb|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=42}}</ref> Hitler in particular wanted the defence to rest on anti-aircraft artillery as it gave the civilian population a \"psychological crutch\" no matter how ineffective the weapons.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 132\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=132}}</ref>\n\nMost of the battles fought by the ''Luftwaffe'' on the Western Front were against [[Circus offensive|the RAF's \"Circus\" raids]] and the occasional daylight raid into German air space. This was a fortunate position since the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s strategy of focusing its striking power on one front started to unravel with the failure of the invasion of the Soviet Union. The \"peripheral\" strategy of the ''Luftwaffe'' between 1939 and 1940 had been to deploy its fighter defences at the edges of Axis occupied territory, with little protecting the inner depths.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 46\">{{harvnb|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=46}}</ref> Moreover, the front line units in the West were complaining about the poor numbers and performance of aircraft. Units complained of lack of ''Zerst\u00f6rer'' aircraft with all-weather capabilities and the \"lack of climbing power of the Bf 109\".<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 46\" /> The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s technical edge was slipping as the only formidable new aircraft in the German arsenal was the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]. ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' Erhard Milch was to assist Ernst Udet with aircraft production increases and introduction of more modern types of fighter aircraft. However, they explained at a meeting of the Reich Industrial Council on 18 September 1941 that the new next generation aircraft had failed to materialize, and production of obsolete types had to continue to meet the growing need for replacements.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 46\" />\n\nThe buildup of the ''[[Jagdwaffe]]'' (\"Fighter Force\") was too rapid and its quality suffered. It was not put under a unified command until 1943, which also affected performance of the nine ''Jagdgeschwader'' fighter wings in existence in 1939. No further units were formed until 1942, and the years of 1940\u20131941 were wasted. OKL failed to construct a strategy; instead its command style was reactionary, and its measures not as effective without thorough planning. This was particularly apparent with the ''[[Sturmb\u00f6ck]]'' squadrons, formed to replace the increasingly ineffective twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rer'' twin-engined heavy fighter wings as the primary defense against USAAF daylight raids. The ''Sturmb\u00f6cke''\nflew Fw 190A fighters armed with heavy 20&nbsp;mm and 30&nbsp;mm cannon to destroy heavy bombers, but this increased the weight and affected the performance of the Fw 190 at a time when the aircraft were meeting large numbers of equal if not superior Allied types.<ref>{{harvnb|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=286}}</ref>\n\nDaytime aerial defense against the USAAF's strongly defended heavy bomber forces, particularly the [[Eighth Air Force]] and the [[Fifteenth Air Force]], had its successes through the calendar year of 1943. But at the start of 1944, [[Jimmy Doolittle#Doolittle's breakthrough in fighter tactics|Eighth AF commander Jimmy Doolittle made a major change in offensive fighter tactics]], which defeated the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s day fighter force from that time onwards. Steadily increasing numbers of the superlative [[North American P-51 Mustang]] single-engine fighter, leading the USAAF's bombers into German airspace defeated first the [[Heavy fighter#Germany|Bf 110 ''Zerst\u00f6rer'']] wings, then the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|Fw 190A Sturmb\u00f6cke]].\n\n===Development and equipment===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-668-7161-31A, Flugzeug Heinkel He 177.jpg|thumb|left|The most troublesome of all German designs during WW II \u2013 both in development and in service \u2013 was the [[Heinkel He 177|He 177]]A ''Greif'' heavy bomber.]]\nIn terms of technological development, the failure to develop a long-range bomber and capable long-range fighters during this period left the ''Luftwaffe'' unable to conduct a meaningful strategic bombing campaign throughout the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007|p=118}}</ref> However, Germany at that time suffered from limitations in raw materials such as oil and aluminium, which meant that there were insufficient resources for much beyond a tactical air force: given these circumstances, the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s reliance on tactical mid-range, twin engined medium bombers and short range dive-bombers was a pragmatic choice of strategy.<ref>{{harvnb|Homze|1976|p=123}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007|p=108}}</ref> It might also be argued that the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s ''Kampfgeschwader'' medium and heavy bomber wings were perfectly capable of attacking strategic targets, but the lack of capable long range escort fighters left the bombers unable to carry out their missions effectively against determined and well organised fighter opposition.<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 282\">{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=282}}</ref>\n\nThe greatest failure for the ''Kampfgeschwader'', however, was being saddled with an aircraft intended as a capable four-engined heavy bomber: the perpetually troubled [[Heinkel He 177]], whose engines were [[Heinkel He 177#Engine difficulties|prone to catch fire]] in flight. Of the [[Heinkel He 277#Trio of separate efforts|three parallel proposals]] from the Heinkel engineering departments for a four engined version of the A-series He 177 [[Heinkel He 277#Trio of separate efforts|by February 1943]], only one, the [[Heinkel He 177#Further development: the Heinkel He 177B|He 177B]], emerged in the concluding months of 1943. Only three airworthy prototypes of the B-series He 177 design were produced by early 1944, some three years after the first prototype flights of the [[Avro Lancaster]], the most successful RAF heavy bomber.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-043-02, Focke-Wulf Fw 200 C Condor.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Arguably, one of the greatest tactical failures was the neglect of naval aviation in the western theatre, 1939\u20131941. (pictured is a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] C Condor)]]\n\nAnother failure of procurement and equipment was the lack of a dedicated [[Naval aviation|naval air arm]]. General Felmy had already expressed a desire to build a naval air arm to support ''Kriegsmarine'' operations in the Atlantic and British waters. Britain was dependent on food and raw materials from its Empire and North America. Felmy pressed this case firmly throughout 1938 and 1939, and, on 31 October 1939, ''[[Gro\u00dfadmiral]]'' [[Erich Raeder]] sent a strongly worded letter to G\u00f6ring in support of such proposals. The early-war twin-engined [[Heinkel He 115]] floatplane and [[Dornier Do 18]] [[flying boat]] were too slow and short-ranged. The then-contemporary [[Blohm & Voss BV 138]] ''Seedrache'' (seadragon) trimotor flying boat became the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s primary seaborne maritime patrol platform, with nearly 300 examples built; its trio of [[Junkers Jumo 205]] diesel engines gave it a 4,300&nbsp;km (2,670&nbsp;mi) maximum range. Another Blohm und Voss design of 1940, the enormous, 46-meter wingspan six-engined [[Blohm und Voss BV 222]] ''Wiking'' maritime patrol flying boat, would see it capable of a 6,800&nbsp;km (4,200-mile) range at maximum endurance when using higher-output versions of the same [[Jumo 205]] powerplants as used by the BV 138, in later years. The [[Dornier Do 217]] would have been ideal as a land-based choice, but suffered production problems. Raeder also complained about the poor standard of aerial torpedoes, although their design was the responsibility of the ''Wehrmacht'' combined military's naval arm (the ''Kriegsmarine''), even considering production of the Japanese [[Type 91 torpedo#Provision of the aerial torpedo technology to Germany|Type 91 torpedo]] used at [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] as the ''Lufttorpedo'' '''LT 850''' by August 1942. (See both:[[Yanagi missions]] and [[Heinkel He 111 operational history#Torpedo bomber operations|Heinkel He 111 torpedo bomber operations]])<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=281}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-yanagi-missions-japans-underwater-convoys.htm |title=World War II: Yanagi Missions \u2013 Japan's Underwater Convoys |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=12 June 2006 |website=historynet.com |publisher=Historynet.com |accessdate=12 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402094746/http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-yanagi-missions-japans-underwater-convoys.htm |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWithout specialised naval or land-based, purpose-designed maritime patrol aircraft, the ''Luftwaffe'' was forced to improvise. The [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] Condor airliner's airframe \u2013 engineered for civilian airliner use \u2013 lacked the structural strength for combat maneuvering at lower altitudes, making it unsuitable for use as a bomber in maritime patrol duties. The Condor lacked speed, armour and bomb load capacity. Sometimes the fuselage literally \"broke its back\" or a wing panel dropped loose from the [[wing root]] after a hard landing. Nevertheless, this civilian transport was adapted for the long-range reconnaissance and anti-shipping roles and, between August 1940 and February 1941, Fw 200s sank 85 vessels for a claimed total of 363,000 Grt. Had the ''Luftwaffe'' focused on naval aviation \u2013 particularly maritime patrol aircraft with long range, like the aforementioned diesel-powered multi-engine Blohm & Voss flying boats \u2013 Germany might well have been in a position to win the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. However, Raeder and the ''Kriegsmarine'' failed to press for naval air power until the war began, mitigating the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s responsibility. In addition, G\u00f6ring regarded any other branch of the German military developing its own aviation as an encroachment on his authority and continually frustrated the Navy's attempts to build its own airpower.<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 282\"/>\n\nThe absence of a strategic bomber force for the ''Luftwaffe'', following General Wever's accidental death in the early summer of 1936 and the end of the [[Ural bomber]] program he fostered before the invasion of Poland, would not be addressed again until the authorization of the \"[[Bomber B]]\" design competition in July 1939, which sought to replace the medium bomber force with which the ''Luftwaffe'' was to begin the war, and the partly achieved ''[[Schnellbomber]]'' high-speed medium bomber concept with more advanced, twin-engined high speed bomber aircraft fitted with pairs of relatively [[Bomber B#High-output engines|\"high-power\" engines]] of 1,500&nbsp;kW (2,000&nbsp;hp) output levels and upwards each as a follow-on to the earlier ''Schnellbomber'' project, that would also be able to function as shorter range heavy bombers. [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B19957, Edgar Petersen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|''Oberst'' [[Edgar Petersen]], the head of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s ''Erprobungsstellen'' network of test facilities late in the war]] The spring 1942 ''[[Amerika Bomber]]'' program also sought to produce useful strategic bomber designs for the ''Luftwaffe'', with their prime design priority being an advanced trans-oceanic range capability as the main aim of the project to directly attack the United States from Europe or the Azores. Inevitably, both the Bomber B and Amerika Bomber programs were victims of the continued emphasis of the ''Wehrmacht'' combined military's insistence for its ''Luftwaffe'' air arm to support the ''Heer'' as its primary mission, and the damage to the German aviation industry from Allied bomber attacks.\n\n====Challenges in directly addressing combat pilots' issues====\nThe RLM's apparent lack of a dedicated \"technical-tactical\" department, that would have directly been in contact with combat pilots to assess their needs for weaponry upgrades and tactical advice, had never been seriously envisioned as a critically ongoing necessity in the planning of the original German air arm.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\">{{harvnb|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=287}}</ref> The RLM did have its own ''Technisches Amt'' (T-Amt) department to handle aviation technology issues, but this was tasked with handling all aviation technology issues in the Third Reich, both military and civilian in nature, and also not known to have ever had any clear and actively administrative and consultative links with the front-line forces established for such purposes. On the front-line combat side of the issue, and for direct contact with the German aviation firms making the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s warplanes, the ''Luftwaffe'' did have its own reasonably effective system of four military aviation test facilities, or ''Erprobungstellen'' located at three coastal sites \u2013 [[Peenem\u00fcnde Airfield|Peenem\u00fcnde-West]] (also incorporating a separate facility in nearby [[Karlshagen]]), [[Tarnewitz test site|Tarnewitz]] and [[Priwall Peninsula|Travem\u00fcnde]] \u2013 and the central inland site of [[Rechlin-L\u00e4rz Airfield|Rechlin]], itself first established as a military airfield in late August 1918 by the German Empire, with the four-facility system commanded later in World War II by ''Oberst'' (Colonel) [[Edgar Petersen]]. However, due to lack of co-ordination between the RLM and OKL, all fighter and bomber development was oriented toward short range aircraft, as they could be produced in greater numbers, rather than quality long range aircraft, something that put the ''Luftwaffe'' at a disadvantage [[Aircraft of the Battle of Britain#German fighter fuel capacity|as early as the Battle of Britain]].<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/> The \"ramp-up\" to production levels required to fulfill the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s front-line needs was also slow, not reaching maximum output until 1944.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/> Production of fighters was not given priority until 1944; [[Adolf Galland]] commented that this should have occurred at least a year earlier.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/> Galland also pointed to the mistakes and challenges made in the development of the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet \u2013 which included the protracted development time required for its [[Junkers Jumo 004]] jet engines to achieve reliability. German combat aircraft types that were first designed and flown in the mid-1930s had become obsolete, yet were kept in production, in particular the Ju 87 Stuka, and the Bf 109, because there were no well-developed replacement designs.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/>\n\n===Production failures===\nThe failure of German production was evident from the start of the Battle of Britain. By the end of 1940 the ''Luftwaffe'' had suffered heavy losses and needed to regroup. Deliveries of new aircraft were insufficient to meet the drain on resources; the ''Luftwaffe'', unlike the RAF, was failing to expand its pilot and aircraft numbers.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 32\">{{harvnb|Overy|1980|p=32}}</ref> This was partly owing to production planning failures before the war and the demands of the army. Nevertheless, the German aircraft industry was being outproduced in 1940. In terms of fighter aircraft production, the British exceeded their production plans by 43%, while the Germans remained 40% \"behind\" target by the summer 1940. In fact German production in fighters fell from 227 to 177 per month between July and September 1940.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 32\"/> One of the many reasons for the failure of the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1940 was that it did not have the operational and material means to destroy the British aircraft industry,<ref>{{harvnb|Overy|1980|p=33}}</ref> something that the much-anticipated ''Bomber B'' design competition was intended to address.\n\nThe so-called \"G\u00f6ring program\", had largely been predicated on the defeat of the Soviet Union in 1941. After the ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s failure in front of Moscow, industrial priorities for a possibility in increasing aircraft production were largely abandoned in favor to support the army's increased attrition rates and heavy equipment losses.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 133\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=133}}</ref> Erhard Milch's reforms expanded production rates. In 1941 an average of 981 aircraft (including 311 fighters) were produced each month.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 133\" /> In 1942 this rose to 1,296 aircraft of which 434 were fighters.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 133\" /> Milch's planned production increases were initially opposed. But in June, he was granted materials for 900 fighters per month as the average output. By the Summer of 1942, ''Luftwaffe's'' operational fighter force had recovered from a low of 39% (44% for fighters and 31% for bombers) in Winter of 1941\u20131942, to 69% by late June (75% for fighters and 66% for bombers) in 1942. However, after increased commitments in the east, overall operational ready rates fluctuated between 59% and 65% for the remaining year.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 138\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=138}}</ref> Throughout 1942 the ''Luftwaffe'' was out produced in fighter aircraft by 250% and in twin-engine aircraft by 196%.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 139\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=139}}</ref>\n\nThe appointment of [[Albert Speer]] as Minister of Armaments increased production of existing designs, and the few new designs that had originated from earlier in the war. However the intensification of Allied bombing caused the dispersion of production and prevented an efficient acceleration of expansion. German aviation production reached about 36,000 combat aircraft for 1944. However, by the time this was achieved the ''Luftwaffe'' lacked the fuel and trained pilots to make this achievement worth while.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, pp. 253-255\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|pp=253\u2013255}}</ref>\n\nThe failure to maximize production immediately after the failures in the Soviet Union and North Africa ensured the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s effective defeat in the period of September 1943 \u2013 February 1944. Despite the tactical victories won, they failed to achieve a decisive victory. By the time production reached acceptable levels, as so many other factors had for the ''Luftwaffe'' \u2013 and for the entire ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s weapons and ordnance technology as a whole \u2013 late in the war, it was \"too little, too late\".<ref name=\"Murray 1983, pp. 253-255\" />\n\n===Engine development===\nBy the late 1930s, [[airframe]] construction methods had progressed to the point where airframes could be built to any required size, founded on the all-metal airframe design technologies pioneered by [[Hugo Junkers]] [[Junkers J 1|in 1915]] and constantly improved upon for over two decades to follow \u2013 especially in Germany with aircraft like the [[Dornier Do X]] flying boat and the [[Junkers G 38]] airliner. However, powering such designs was a major challenge. Mid-1930s aero engines were limited to about 600&nbsp;hp and the first 1000&nbsp;hp engines were just entering the prototype stage \u2013 for the then-new Third Reich's ''Luftwaffe'' air arm, this meant inverted liquid-cooled V12 designs like the [[Daimler-Benz DB 601]].\n\nThe [[United States]] had already gotten its start towards this goal by 1937 with two large displacement, twin-row 18-cylinder air-cooled radial engine designs of at least 46 litres (2,800 in{{sup|3}}) displacement each: the [[Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp#Design and development|Pratt & Whitney ''Double Wasp'']] and the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright ''Duplex-Cyclone'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.468thbombgroup.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=sPINPiUsDfI%3D&tabid=36&mid=467 |title=B-29 Design/Devemopment \u2013 Engines |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=468thbombgroup.org |accessdate=1 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630172931/http://468thbombgroup.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=sPINPiUsDfI%3d&tabid=36&mid=467 |archive-date=30 June 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nNazi Germany's initial need for substantially more powerful aviation engines originated with the private venture [[Heinkel He 119]] high-speed reconnaissance design, and the ostensibly twin-\"engined\" [[Messerschmitt Me 261]] for maritime reconnaissance duties \u2013 to power each of these designs, Daimler-Benz literally \"doubled-up\" their new, fuel-injected DB 601 engines. This \"doubling-up\" involved placing two DB 601s side-by-side on either side of a common vertical-plane space frame with their crankcases' outer sides each having a mount similar to what would be used in a single-engine installation, creating a \"mirror-image\" centrifugal supercharger for the starboard-side component DB 601, inclining the top ends of their crankcases inwards by roughly 30\u00ba to mate with the space-frame central mount, and placing a common propeller gear reduction housing across the front ends of the two engines. Such a twin-crankcased \"power system\" aviation engine crafted from a pair of DB 601s resulted in the 2,700 PS (1,986&nbsp;kW) maximum output DB 606 \"coupled\" engine design for these two aircraft in February 1937, but with each of the DB 606 \"coupled\" engines weighing in at around 1.5 tonnes apiece.<ref name=weldedtogether-606>{{harvnb|Griehl|Dressel|1998|p=224}}</ref>\n\nThe early development of the DB 606 \"coupled\" engines, was paralleled during the late 1930s with Daimler-Benz's simultaneous development of a 1,500&nbsp;kW class engine design using a single crankcase. The result was the twenty-four cylinder [[Daimler-Benz DB 604]] [[X engine|X-configuration]] engine, with four banks of six cylinders each. Possessing essentially the same displacement of 46.5 litres (2830 in<sup>3</sup>) as the initial version of the liquid-cooled [[Junkers Jumo 222]] multibank engine, itself a \"converse\" choice in configuration to the DB 604 in possessing six banks of four inline cylinders apiece instead; coincidentally, both the original Jumo 222 design and the DB 604 each weighed about a third less (at some 1,080&nbsp;kg/2,379&nbsp;lb of dry weight) than the DB 606, but the DB 604's protracted development was diverting valuable German aviation powerplant research resources, and with more development of the \"twinned-[[Daimler-Benz DB 605|DB 605]]\" based DB 610 coupled engine (itself initiated in June 1940 with top output level of 2950 PS (2,909&nbsp;hp),<ref name=weldedtogether-606 /> and brought together in the same way \u2013 with the same all-up weight of 1.5 tonnes \u2013 as the DB 606 had been) giving improved results at the time, the Reich Air Ministry stopped all work on the DB 604 in September 1942.<ref>{{cite book |last1=von Gersdorff |first1=Kyrill |last2=Schubert |first2=Helmut |title=Die deutsche Luftfahrt: Flugmotoren und Strahltriebwerke. |language=German |year=2007 |publisher=Bernard & Graefe Verlag |location=Bonn |isbn=978-3-7637-6128-9}}</ref> Such \"coupled powerplants\" were the exclusive choice of power for the [[Heinkel He 177]]A ''Greif'' heavy bomber, mistasked from its beginnings in being intended to do moderate-angle \"dive bombing\" for a 30-meter wingspan class, heavy bomber design \u2013 the twin nacelles for a pair of DB 606s or 610s did reduce drag for such a combat \"requirement\", but the poor design of the He 177A's engine accommodations for these twin-crankcase \"power systems\" caused [[Heinkel He 177#Engine difficulties|repeated outbreaks of engine fires]], causing the \"dive bombing\" requirement for the He 177A to be cancelled by mid-September 1942.<ref>{{harvnb|Griehl|Dressel|1998|p=54}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Daimler Benz DB 610.jpg|thumb|right|A restored DB 610 \"power system\" engine, comprising a pair of DB 605 inverted V12s \u2013 the top of its central space-frame motor-mount structure can be seen.]]\nBMW worked on what was essentially an enlarged version of its highly successful [[BMW 801]] design from the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]A.

Even the largest-displacement inverted V12 aircraft powerplant built in Germany, the 44.52-litre (2,717 cu. in.) [[Daimler-Benz DB 603]], which saw widespread use in twin-engined designs, could not exceed the 1,500&nbsp;kW output level without more development. By March 1940, even the DB 603 was being \"twinned-up\"<ref name=weldedtogether-606 /> as the 601/606 and 605/610 had been, to become their replacement \"power system\": this was the strictly experimental, approximately 1.8-tonne weight apiece, twin-crankcase DB 613; capable of over 2,570&nbsp;kW (3,495 PS) output, but which never left its test phase.\n\nThe proposed over-1,500&nbsp;kW output subtypes of German aviation industry's existing piston aviation engine designs\u2014which adhered to using just a single crankcase that ''were'' able to substantially exceed the aforementioned over-1,500&nbsp;kW output level\u2014were the DB 603 LM (1,800&nbsp;kW at take-off, in production), the DB 603 N (2,205&nbsp;kW at take-off, planned for 1946) and the BMW 801F (1,765&nbsp;kW (2,400 PS) engines. The pioneering nature of jet engine technology in the 1940s resulted in numerous development problems for both of Germany's major jet engine designs to see mass production, the [[Jumo 004]] and [[BMW 003]] (both of pioneering [[Axial-flow compressor|axial flow]] design), with the more powerful [[Heinkel HeS 011]] never leaving the test phase, as only 19 examples of the HeS 011 would ever be built for development.<ref>Christopher, John. ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes''. The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013. p. 74.</ref> Even with such dismal degrees of success for such advanced aviation powerplant designs, more and more design proposals for new German combat aircraft in the 1943\u201345 period centered either around the failed Jumo 222 or HeS 011 aviation powerplants for their propulsion.\n\n===Personnel and leadership===\nThe bomber arm was given preference and received the \"better\" pilots. Later, fighter pilot leaders were few in numbers as a result of this. As with the late shift to fighter production, the ''Luftwaffe'' pilot schools did not give the fighter pilot schools preference soon enough. The ''Luftwaffe'', OKW argued, was still an offensive weapon, and its primary focus was on producing bomber pilots. This attitude prevailed until the second half of 1943.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/> During the [[Defence of the Reich]] campaign in 1943 and 1944, there were not enough commissioned fighter pilots and leaders to meet attrition rates;<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/> as the need arose to replace aircrew (as attrition rates increased), the quality of [[Defence of the Reich#Pilot selection and training|pilot training deteriorated]] rapidly. Later this was made worse by [[Oil Campaign of World War II|fuel shortages for pilot training]]. Overall this meant reduced training on operational types, formation flying, gunnery training, and combat training, and a total lack of instrument training.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of the war commanders were replaced with younger commanders too quickly. These younger commanders had to learn \"in the field\" rather than entering a post fully qualified. Training of formation leaders was not systematic until 1943, which was far too late, with the ''Luftwaffe'' already stretched. The ''Luftwaffe'' thus lacked a cadre of staff officers to set up, man, and pass on experience.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/>\n\nMoreover, ''Luftwaffe'' leadership from the start poached the training command, which undermined its ability to replace losses,<ref name=\"Ketley and Rolfe, p. 4\" /> while also planning for \"short sharp campaigns\",<ref name=\"Ketley and Rolfe, p. 8\">{{harvnb|Ketley|Rolfe |1996|p=8}}</ref> which did not pertain. Moreover, no plans were laid for [[night fighter]]s.<ref name=\"Ketley and Rolfe, p. 8\"/> In fact, when protests were raised, [[Hans Jeschonnek]], Chief of the General Staff of the ''Luftwaffe'', said, \"First we've got to beat Russia, then we can start training!\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ketley|Rolfe |1996|loc=quoted p. 4}}</ref>\n\n==''Luftwaffe'' ground forces==\nOne of the unique characteristics of the ''Luftwaffe'' (as opposed to other independent air forces) was the possession of an organic [[paratrooper]] force called ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]''. Eestablished in 1938, they saw action in their proper role during 1940\u20131941, most notably in the capture of the Belgian Army fortress at the [[Battle of Fort Eben-Emael]] and the [[Battle for The Hague]] in May 1940, and during the [[Battle of Crete]] in May 1941. However, more than 4,000 ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' were killed during the Crete operation.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayer|Taylor|1974|p=95}}</ref> Afterwards, although continuing to be trained in parachute delivery, paratroopers were only used in a parachute role for smaller-scale operations, such as [[Gran Sasso raid|the rescue of Benito Mussolini in 1943]]. ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' formations were mainly used as crack foot infantry in all theatres of the war. Their losses were 22,041 KIA, 57,594 WIA and 44,785 MIA (until February 1945).<ref name=\"Hahn, Fritz 1945\"/>\n\nDuring 1942 surplus ''Luftwaffe'' personnel (see above) was used to form the [[Luftwaffe Field Division|''Luftwaffe'' Field Division]]s, standard infantry divisions that were used chiefly as [[bandit fighting|rear echelon units]] to free up front line troops. From 1943, the ''Luftwaffe'' also had an armoured paratroop division called [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|''Fallschirm-Panzer'' Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring]], which was expanded to a ''[[Panzerkorps]]'' in 1944.\n\nGround support and combat units from the ''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'' (RAD) and the [[National Socialist Motor Corps]] (NSKK) were also put at the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s disposal during the war. In 1942 56 RAD companies served with the ''Luftwaffe'' in the West as airfield construction troops. In 1943 420 RAD companies were trained as [[anti-aircraft artillery]] (AAA) and posted to existing ''Luftwaffe'' AAA battalions in the homeland. At the end of the war, these units were also fighting allied tanks. Beginning in 1939 with a transport regiment, the NSKK had in 1942 a complete division sized transportation unit serving the ''Luftwaffe'', the ''NSKK Transportgruppe Luftwaffe'' serving in France and at the Eastern front. The overwhelming number of its 12,000 members were Belgian, Dutch and French citizens.<ref>Thomas, Nigel & Caballero Jurado, Carlos (1992). ''Wehrmacht Auxiliary Forces''.

With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty, the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935, just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through [[German re-armament]] and conscription would be announced on 16 March.<ref>{{harvnb|Fischer|1995|p=408}}</ref> The [[Condor Legion]], a ''Luftwaffe'' detachment sent to aid [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War]], provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft. Partially as a result of this combat experience, the ''Luftwaffe'' had become one of the most sophisticated, technologically advanced, and battle-experienced air forces in the world when [[World War II]] broke out in 1939.<ref>{{harvnb|Killen|2003|p=93}}</ref> By the summer of 1939, the ''Luftwaffe'' had twenty-eight ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe during World War II#Types of Geschwader|Geschwader]]'' [[Wing (military aviation unit)|(wings)]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' also operated ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' [[paratrooper]] units.\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and [[Battle of France|Western Europe]] in 1939 and 1940. During the [[Battle of Britain]], however, despite inflicting severe damage to the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]'s infrastructure and, during [[The Blitz|the subsequent Blitz]], devastating many British cities, the German air force failed to batter the beleaguered British into submission. From 1942, Allied bombing campaigns gradually destroyed the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s fighter arm. From late 1942, the ''Luftwaffe'' used its surplus ground support and other personnel to raise [[Luftwaffe Field Division|''Luftwaffe'' Field Divisions]]. In addition to its service in [[Western Front (World War II)|the West]], the ''Luftwaffe'' operated over the Soviet Union, North Africa and Southern Europe. Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket propelled aircraft for [[bomber destroyer|the destruction of Allied bombers]], the ''Luftwaffe'' was overwhelmed by the Allies' superior numbers and improved tactics, and a lack of trained pilots and aviation fuel. In January 1945, during the closing stages of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the ''Luftwaffe'' [[Operation Bodenplatte|made a last-ditch effort to win air superiority]], and met with failure. With rapidly dwindling supplies of [[Oil Campaign of World War II|petroleum, oil, and lubricants]] after this campaign, and as part of the entire combined ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' military forces as a whole, the ''Luftwaffe'' ceased to be an effective fighting force.\n\nAfter the defeat of Germany, the ''Luftwaffe'' was disbanded in 1946. During World War II, German pilots claimed roughly 70,000 aerial victories, while over 75,000 ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft were destroyed or significantly damaged. Of these, nearly 40,000 were lost entirely. The ''Luftwaffe'' had only two commanders-in-chief throughout its history: [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and later ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Robert Ritter von Greim]] for the last two weeks of the war.\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' was deeply involved in [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|Nazi war crimes]]. By the end of the war, a significant percentage of aircraft production originated in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], an industry employing tens of thousands of prisoners.{{refn|group=N|name=production}} The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s demand for labor was one of the factors that led to the deportation and murder of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews in 1944. The ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'' organized [[Nazi human experimentation]], and ''Luftwaffe'' ground troops committed massacres in [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and [[Poland]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n{{main|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte|Aviation in World War I}}\n<!----[[File:Greek cross.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|Emblem of the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' from March/April 1918 to the Armistice.]]---->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0430-501, Jagdstaffel 11, Manfred v.

It was renamed the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' on 8 October 1916.<ref>{{harvnb|Blumberg|2014|p=39}}</ref> The air war on the Western Front received the most attention in the annals of the earliest accounts of military aviation, since it produced aces such as [[Manfred von Richthofen]] and [[Ernst Udet]], [[Oswald Boelcke]], and [[Max Immelmann]]. After the defeat of Germany, the service was dissolved on 8 May 1920 under the conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which also mandated the destruction of all German military aircraft.\n\nSince the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to have an air force, German pilots trained in secret. Initially, civil aviation schools within Germany were used, yet only light [[trainer (aircraft)|trainers]] could be used in order to maintain the fa\u00e7ade that the trainees were going to fly with civil airlines such as [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]]. To train its pilots on the latest combat aircraft, Germany solicited the help of the [[Soviet Union]], which was also isolated in Europe. A [[Fighter pilot school Lipetsk|secret training airfield was established at Lipetsk]] in 1924 and operated for approximately nine years using mostly Dutch and Soviet, but also some German, training aircraft before being closed in 1933. This base was officially known as 4th squadron of the 40th wing of the Red Army. Hundreds of ''Luftwaffe'' pilots and technical personnel visited, studied and were trained at Soviet air force schools in several locations in Central Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Stein|1962|pp=54\u201371}}</ref> Roessing, Blume, Fosse, Teetsemann, Heini, Makratzki, Blumendaat, and many other future ''Luftwaffe'' aces were trained in Russia in joint Russian-German schools that were set up under the patronage of [[Ernst August K\u00f6string]].\n\nThe first steps towards the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s formation were undertaken just months after [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], a [[World War I]] ace, became National ''Kommissar'' for aviation with former Luft Hansa director [[Erhard Milch]] as his deputy. In April 1933 the [[Reich Aviation Ministry]] (''Reichsluftfahrtministerium'' or RLM) was established. The RLM was in charge of development and production of aircraft. G\u00f6ring's control over all aspects of aviation became absolute. On 25 March 1933 the [[German Air Sports Association]] absorbed all private and national organizations, while retaining its 'sports' title. On 15 May 1933, all military aviation organizations in the RLM were merged, forming the ''Luftwaffe''; its official 'birthday'.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=30}}</ref> The [[National Socialist Flyers Corps]] (''Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps'' or NSFK) was formed in 1937 to give pre-military flying training to male youths, and to engage adult sport aviators in the Nazi movement. Military-age members of the NSFK were drafted into the ''Luftwaffe''. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members, this gave the new ''Luftwaffe'' a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|''Heer'']] (Army) and the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (Navy)). G\u00f6ring played a leading role in the buildup of the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1933\u201336, but had little further involvement in the development of the force after 1936, and Milch became the \"de facto\" minister until 1937.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=31}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of G\u00f6ring in planning and production matters was fortunate. G\u00f6ring had little knowledge of current aviation, had last flown in 1922, and had not kept himself informed of latest events. G\u00f6ring also displayed a lack of understanding of doctrine and technical issues in aerial warfare which he left to others more competent. The Commander-in-Chief left the organisation and building of the ''Luftwaffe'', after 1936, to Erhard Milch. However G\u00f6ring, as a part of Hitler's inner circle, provided access to financial resources and materiel for rearming and equipping the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|pp=124\u2013125}}</ref>\n\nAnother prominent figure in German air power construction this time was [[Helmuth Wilberg]]. Wilberg later played a large role in the development of German air doctrine. Having headed the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' air staff for eight years in the 1920s, Wilberg had considerable experience and was ideal for a senior staff position.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=125}}</ref> G\u00f6ring considered making Wilberg [[Chief of Staff]] (CS). However, it was revealed Wilberg had a Jewish mother. For that reason G\u00f6ring could not have him as CS. Not wishing his talent to go to waste, G\u00f6ring ensured the racial laws of the Third Reich did not apply to him. Wilberg remained in the air staff, and under [[Walther Wever (general)|Walther Wever]] helped draw up the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s principle doctrinal texts, \"The Conduct of the Aerial War\" and \"Regulation 16\".<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=127}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2010|pp=20\u201321}}</ref>\n\n===Preparing for war: 1933\u201339===\n====Wever years, 1933\u201336====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-1941, Walther Wever.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Walther Wever (general)|Walther Wever]], Chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' General Staff, 1933\u20131936]]\n\nThe German officer Corps was keen to develop [[strategic bombing]] capabilities against its enemies. However, economic and geopolitical considerations had to take priority. The German air power theorists continued to develop strategic theories, but emphasis was given to army support, as Germany was a continental power and expected to face ground operations following any declaration of hostilities.<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=1}}</ref>\n\nFor these reasons, between 1933 and 1934, the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s leadership was primarily concerned with tactical and operational methods. In aerial terms, the army concept of ''[[Truppenf\u00fchrung]]'' was an operational concept, as well as a tactical doctrine. In World War I, the ''Fliegertruppe's'' initial, 1914\u201315 era ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' observation/reconnaissance air units, each with six two-seater aircraft apiece, had been attached to specific army formations and acted as support. [[Dive bomber]] units were considered essential to ''Truppenf\u00fchrung'', attacking enemy headquarters and lines of communications.<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 129\">{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=129}}</ref> ''Luftwaffe'' \"Regulation 10: The Bomber\" (''Dienstvorschrift 10: Das Kampfflugzeug''), published in 1934, advocated air superiority and approaches to ground attack tactics without dealing with operational matters. Until 1935, the 1926 manual \"Directives for the Conduct of the Operational Air War\" continued to act as the main guide for German air operations. The manual directed OKL to focus on limited operations (not strategic operations): the protection of specific areas and support of the army in combat.<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 129\"/>\n\nWith an effective tactical-operational concept,<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=130}}</ref> the German air power theorists needed a strategic doctrine and organisation. Robert Knauss, a serviceman (not pilot) in the ''Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte'' during World War I, and later an experienced pilot with Lufthansa,<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=132}}</ref> was a prominent theorist of air power. Knauss promoted the [[Giulio Douhet]] theory that air power could win wars alone by destroying enemy industry and breaking enemy morale by \"terrorizing the population\" of major cities. This advocated attacks on civilians.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=133}}</ref> The General Staff blocked the entry of Douhet's theory into doctrine, fearing revenge strikes against German civilians and cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|pp=133\u2013134}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1934, Chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' [[General Staff]] [[Walther Wever (general)|Walther Wever]] sought to mould the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s battle doctrine into a strategic plan. At this time, Wever conducted war games (simulated against France) in a bid to establish his theory of a strategic bombing force that would, he thought, prove decisive by winning the war through the destruction of enemy industry, even though these exercises also included tactical strikes against enemy ground forces and communications. In 1935, \"''Luftwaffe'' Regulation 16: The Conduct of the Air War\" was drawn up. In the proposal, it concluded, \"The mission of the ''Luftwaffe'' is to serve these goals.\"<ref name=\"Hooton 2007, ''Luftwaffe at War: Gathering Storm'', p. 34\">{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=34}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2010|p=28}}</ref>\n\nCorum states that under this doctrine, the ''Luftwaffe'' leadership rejected the practice of \"[[terror bombing]]\" (see [[Blitzkrieg#Luftwaffe doctrine|''Luftwaffe'' strategic bombing doctrine]]).<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 7\">{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=7}}</ref> According to Corum terror bombing was deemed to be \"counter-productive\", increasing rather than destroying the enemy's will to resist.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|pp=143\u2013144}}</ref> Such bombing campaigns were regarded as diversion from the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s main operations; destruction of the enemy armed forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=146}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Wever recognised the importance of [[strategic bombing]]. In newly introduced doctrine, ''The Conduct of the Aerial Air War'' in 1935, Wever rejected the theory of Douhet<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=143}}</ref> and outlined five key points to air strategy:<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=138}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n#To destroy the enemy air force by bombing its bases and aircraft factories, and defeating enemy air forces attacking German targets.\n#To prevent the movement of large enemy ground forces to the decisive areas by destroying railways and roads, particularly bridges and tunnels, which are indispensable for the movement and supply of forces\n#To support the operations of the army formations, independent of railways, i.e, armoured forces and motorised forces, by impeding the enemy advance and participating directly in ground operations.\n#To support naval operations by attacking naval bases, protecting Germany's naval bases and participating directly in naval battles\n#To paralyse the enemy armed forces by stopping production in the armaments factories.\n</blockquote>\n\nWever began planning for a strategic bomber force and sought to incorporate strategic bombing into a war strategy. He believed that tactical aircraft should only be used as a step to developing a strategic air force. In May 1934, Wever initiated a seven-year project to develop the so-called \"[[Ural bomber]]\", which could strike as far as into the heart of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1935, this design competition led to the [[Dornier Do 19]] and [[Junkers Ju 89]] prototypes, although both were underpowered. In April 1936, Wever issue requirements for the 'Bomber A' design competition: a range of 6,700&nbsp;km (4,163&nbsp;mi) with a 900&nbsp;kg (1,984&nbsp;lb) bomb load. However Wever's vision of a \"Ural\" bomber was never realised,<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=33}}</ref> and his emphasis on strategic aerial operations was lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=224}}</ref> The only design submittal for Wever's 'Bomber A' that reached production was [[Heinkel]]'s ''Projekt 1041'', which culminated in the production and frontline service as Germany's only operational heavy bomber, the [[Heinkel He 177]], on 5 November 1937, the date on which it received its [[List of RLM aircraft designations#101-200|RLM airframe number]].{{sfn|Griehl|Dressel1998|p=9}}\n\nIn 1935, the military functions of the RLM were grouped into ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'' (OKL; \"Air Force High Command\").\n\nFollowing the untimely death of Walther Wever in early June 1936 in an [[Gust lock#Safety|aviation-related accident]], by the late 1930s the ''Luftwaffe'' had no clear purpose. The air force was not subordinated to the army support role, and it was not given any particular strategic mission. German doctrine fell between the two concepts. The ''Luftwaffe'' was to be an organization capable of carrying out broad and general support tasks rather than any specific mission. Mainly, this path was chosen to encourage a more flexible use of air power and offer the ground forces the right conditions for a decisive victory. In fact, on the outbreak of war, only 15% of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s aircraft were devoted to ground support operations, counter to the long-held myth that the ''Luftwaffe'' was designed for only tactical and operational missions.<ref>{{harvnb|Buckley|1998|pp=85\u201386}}</ref>\n\n====Change of direction, 1936\u201337====\nWever's participation in the construction of the ''Luftwaffe'' came to an abrupt end on 3 June 1936 when he was killed along with his engineer in a [[Heinkel He 70]] Blitz, ironically on the very day that his \"Bomber A\" heavy bomber design competition was announced. After Wever's death G\u00f6ring began taking more of an interest in the appointment of ''Luftwaffe'' staff officers. G\u00f6ring appointed his successor [[Albert Kesselring]] as Chief of Staff and [[Ernst Udet]] to head the Reich's Air Ministry Technical Office (''Technisches Amt''), although he was not a technical expert. Despite this Udet helped change the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s tactical direction towards fast medium bombers to destroy enemy air power in the battle zone rather than through industrial bombing of its aviation production.<ref name=\"Hooton 2007, ''Luftwaffe at War: Gathering Storm'', p. 34\"/>\n\nKesselring and Udet did not get on. During Kesselring's time as CS, 1936\u20131937, a power struggle developed between the two as Udet attempted to extend his own power within the ''Luftwaffe''. Kesselring also had to contend with G\u00f6ring appointing \"yes men\" to positions of importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=225}}</ref> Udet realised his limitations, and his failures in the production and development of German aircraft would have serious long term consequences.<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=227}}</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1984-112-13, Ernst Udet.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Ernst Udet]]. Along with Albert Kesselring, Udet was responsible for establishing the design trend of German aircraft. Udet's focus was on tactical army support air forces]]\n\nThe failure of the ''Luftwaffe'' to progress further towards attaining a strategic bombing force was attributable to several reasons. Many in the ''Luftwaffe'' command believed medium bombers to be sufficient power to launch strategic bombing operations against Germany's most likely enemies; France, [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Poland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=10}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom]] presented greater problems. ''[[General der Flieger]]'' [[Hellmuth Felmy]], commander of ''[[Luftflotte 2]]'' in 1939, was charged with devising a plan for an air war over the British Isles. Felmy was convinced that Britain could be defeated through morale bombing. Felmy noted the alleged panic that had broken out in London during the [[Munich crisis]], evidence he believed of British weakness. A second reason was technical. German designers had never solved the issues of the [[Heinkel He 177]]A's design difficulties, brought on by the requirement from its inception on 5 November 1937 to have moderate dive bombing capabilities in a 30-meter wingspan aircraft. Moreover, Germany did not possess the economic resources to match the later British and American effort of 1943\u20131944, particularly in large-scale mass production of [[Bomber B#High-output aviation engines for the Luftwaffe|high power output aircraft engines]] (with output of over least 1,500&nbsp;kW (2,000&nbsp;hp). In addition, OKL had not foreseen the industrial and military effort strategic bombing would require. By 1939 the ''Luftwaffe'' was not much better prepared than its enemies to conduct a strategic bombing campaign,<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=11}}</ref> with fatal results during the [[Battle of Britain]].<ref>{{harvnb|Overy|1980|p=31}}</ref>\n\nThe German rearmament program faced difficulties acquiring raw materials. Germany imported most of its essential materials for rebuilding the ''Luftwaffe'', in particular rubber and aluminium. Petroleum imports were particularly vulnerable to blockade. Germany pushed for synthetic fuel plants, but still failed to meet demands. In 1937 Germany imported more fuel than it had at the start of the decade. By the summer 1938 only 25% of requirements could be covered. In steel materials, industry was operating at barely 83% of capacity, and by November 1938 G\u00f6ring reported the economic situation was serious.<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=2}}</ref> The ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (OKW), the overall command for all German military forces, ordered reductions in raw materials and steel used for armament production. The figures for reduction were substantial: 30% steel, 20% copper, 47% aluminium, and 14% rubber.<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=3}}</ref> Under such circumstances, it was not possible for Milch, Udet, or Kesselring to produce a formidable strategic bombing force even had they wanted to do so.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe development of aircraft was now confined to the production of twin-engined medium bombers that required much less material, manpower and aviation production capacity than Wever's \"Ural Bomber\". German industry could build two medium bombers for one heavy bomber and the RLM would not gamble on developing a heavy bomber which would also take time. G\u00f6ring remarked, \"the ''F\u00fchrer'' will not ask how big the bombers there are, but only how many there are.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Homze|1976|p=125}}</ref> The premature death of Wever, one of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s finest officers, left the ''Luftwaffe'' without a strategic air force during World War II, which eventually proved fatal to the German war effort.<ref name=\"Hooton 2007, ''Luftwaffe at War: Gathering Storm'', p. 34\"/>{{sfn|Dressel|Griehl|1994|p= 176}}<ref>{{harvnb|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007|pp=129\u2013130}}</ref>\n\nThe lack of strategic capability should have been apparent much earlier. The [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Sudeten Crisis]] highlighted German unpreparedness to conduct a strategic air war (although the British and French were in a much weaker position), and Hitler ordered the ''Luftwaffe'' be expanded to five times its earlier size.{{sfn|Ketley|Rolfe|1996|p=3}} OKL badly neglected the need for transport aircraft; even in 1943, transport units were described as ''Kampfgeschwadern zur besonderen Verwendung'' (Bomber Units on Special Duties, KGzbV).{{sfn|Ketley|Rolfe|1996|p=7}} and only grouping them together into dedicated cargo and personnel transport wings (''Transportgeschwader'') during that year. In March 1938, as the ''[[Anschluss]]'' was taking place, G\u00f6ring ordered Felmy to investigate the prospect of air raids against Britain. Felmy concluded it was not possible until bases in [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] were obtained and the ''Luftwaffe'' had heavy bombers. It mattered little, as war was avoided by the Munich Agreement, and the need for long-range aircraft did not arise.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=77}}</ref>\n\nThese failures were not exposed until wartime. In the meantime German designs of mid-1930s origin such as the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], [[Heinkel He 111]], [[Junkers Ju 87]] Stuka, and [[Dornier Do 17]], performed very well. All first saw active service in the [[Condor Legion]] against Soviet-supplied aircraft. The ''Luftwaffe'' also quickly realized the days of the biplane fighter were finished, the [[Heinkel He 51]] being switched to service as a trainer. Particularly impressive were the Heinkel and Dornier, which fulfilled the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s requirements for bombers that were faster than 1930s-era fighters, many of which were biplanes or strut-braced monoplanes.\n\nDespite the participation of these aircraft (mainly from 1938 onward), it was the venerable [[Junkers Ju 52]] (which soon became the backbone of the ''Transportgruppen'') that made the main contribution. During the Spanish Civil War Hitler remarked, \"Franco ought to erect a monument to the glory of the Junkers Ju 52. It is the aircraft which the Spanish revolution has to thank for its victory.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=51}}</ref>\n\n====Dive-bombing====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-646-5188-17, Flugzeuge Junkers Ju 87.jpg|thumb|right|[[Junkers Ju 87]] Ds over the Eastern Front, winter 1943\u201344]]\nPoor accuracy from level bombers in 1937 led the ''Luftwaffe'' to grasp the benefits of dive-bombing. The latter could achieve far better accuracy against tactical ground targets than heavier conventional bombers. Range was not a key criterion for this mission. It was not always feasible for the army to move heavy artillery over recently captured territory to bombard fortifications or support ground forces, and dive bombers could do the job faster. Dive bombers, often single-engine two-man machines, could achieve better results than larger six or seven-man aircraft, at a tenth of the cost and four times the accuracy. This led to Udet championing the dive bomber, particularly the [[Junkers Ju 87]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=38}}</ref>\n\nUdet's \"love affair\" with dive bombing seriously affected the long-term development of the ''Luftwaffe'', especially after General Wever's death. The tactical strike aircraft programs were meant to serve as interim solutions until the next generation of aircraft arrived. In 1936 the [[Junkers Ju 52]] was the backbone of the German bomber fleet. This led to a rush on the part of the RLM to produce the [[Junkers Ju 86]], [[Heinkel He 111]], and [[Dornier Do 17]] before a proper evaluation was made. The Ju 86 was poor while the He 111 showed most promise. The [[Spanish Civil War]] convinced Udet (along with limited output from the German munitions industry) that wastage was not acceptable in munition terms. Udet sought to build dive bombing into the [[Junkers Ju 88]] and conveyed the same idea, initiated specifically by OKL for the [[Heinkel He 177]], approved in early November 1937. In the case of the Ju 88, 50,000 modifications had to be made. The weight was increased from seven to twelve tons. This resulted in a speed loss of 200&nbsp;km/h. Udet merely conveyed OKL's own dive bombing capability request to [[Ernst Heinkel]] concerning the He 177, who vehemently opposed such an idea, which ruined its development as a heavy bomber.<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=14}}</ref> G\u00f6ring was not able to rescind the dive bombing requirement for the He 177A until September 1942.{{sfn|Griehl|Dressel|1998|p= 53}}\n\n====Mobilization, 1938\u201341====\nBy the summer of 1939, the ''Luftwaffe'' had ready for combat nine ''Jagdgeschwader'' (fighter wings) mostly equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, four '''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe during World War II#Types of Geschwader|Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader]]'' (destroyer wings) equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter, 11 ''[[Kampfgeschwader]]'' (bomber wings) equipped mainly with the Heinkel He 111 and the Dornier Do 17Z, and four ''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' (dive bomber wing\") primarily armed with the iconic [[Junkers Ju 87]]B ''Stuka''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=79}}</ref> The ''Luftwaffe'' was just starting to accept the [[Junkers Ju 88]]A for service, as it had encountered design difficulties, with only a dozen aircraft of the type considered combat-ready. The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s strength at this time stood at 373,000 personnel (208,000 flying troops, 107,000 in the Flak Corps and 58,000 in the Signals Corps). Aircraft strength was 4,201 operational aircraft: 1,191 bombers, 361 dive bombers, 788 fighters, 431 heavy fighters, and 488 transports.

Despite the shortage of raw-materials, ''Generalluftzeugmeister'' Ernst Udet had increased production through introducing a 10-hour working day for aviation industries and rationalizing production. During this period 30 ''Kampfstaffeln'' and 16 ''Jagdstaffeln'' were raised and equipped. A further five ''Zerst\u00f6rergruppen'' (\"Destroyer groups\") were created (JGr 101, 102,126,152 and 176), all equipped with the Bf 110.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=23}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' also greatly expanded its aircrew training programs by 42%, to 63 flying schools. These facilities were moved to eastern Germany, away from possible Allied threats. The number of aircrew reached 4,727, an increase of 31%. However, the rush to complete this rapid expansion scheme resulted in the deaths of 997 personnel and another 700 wounded. 946 aircraft were also destroyed in these accidents. The number of aircrew completing their training was up to 3,941, The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s entire strength was now 2.2&nbsp;million personnel.<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007a|p=24}}</ref>\n\nIn April and May 1941, Udet headed the ''Luftwaffe'' delegation inspecting Soviet aviation industry in compliance with the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. Udet informed G\u00f6ring \"that Soviet air forces are very strong and technically advanced.\" G\u00f6ring decided not to report the facts to Hitler, hoping that a surprise attack would quickly destroy the USSR.<ref name=\"RF\">\"\u0411\u043e\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0444\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0444\u0444\u0435\", \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 2008 \u0433., \u0438\u0437\u0434. \u042f\u0443\u0437\u0430-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441, \u043f\u043e \"Rise and fall of the German Air Force\", \u041b\u043e\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043d 1948 \u0433., \u043f\u0435\u0440. \u041f.\u0421\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432, {{ISBN|978-5-9955-0028-5}}</ref> Udet realized that the upcoming war on Russia might cripple Germany.

The first was [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], with the second and last being ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Robert Ritter von Greim]]. His appointment as commander-in-chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' was concomitant with his promotion to ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'', the last German officer in World War II to be promoted to the highest rank.

As the war progressed more air fleets were created as the areas under German rule expanded. As one example, [[Luftflotte 5|''Luftflotte'' 5]] was created in 1940 to direct operations in Norway and Denmark, and other ''Luftflotten'' were created as necessary. Each ''Luftflotte'' would contain several ''Fliegerkorps'' (Air Corps), ''Fliegerdivision'' (Air Division), ''Jagdkorps'' (Fighter Corps),''Jagddivision'' (Air Division) or ''Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer'' (Fighter Air Command). Each formations would have attached to it a number of units, usually several ''Geschwader'', but also independent ''Staffeln'' and ''[[Kampfgruppen]]''.<ref name=\"Luftwaffe Tactical Organisation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.feldgrau.com/luftorg.html|title=High Command of the Luftwaffe|work=feldgrau.com|access-date=26 September 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170617140838/http://www.feldgrau.com/WW2-German-Luftwaffe-High-Command|archive-date=17 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Luftflotten'' were also responsible for the training aircraft and schools in their operational areas.<ref name=\"Ketley and Rolfe, p. 4\">{{harvnb|Ketley|Rolfe |1996|p=4}}</ref>\n\nA ''Geschwader'' was commanded by a ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'', with the [[Military rank|rank]] of either major, ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' ([[lieutenant colonel]]) or ''[[Oberst]]'' ([[colonel]]). Other \"staff\" officers within the unit with administrative duties included the adjutant, technical officer, and operations officer, who were usually (though not always) experienced aircrew or pilots still flying on operations. Other specialist staff were navigation, signals, and intelligence personnel. A ''Stabschwarm'' (headquarters [[Flight (military unit)|flight]]) was attached to each ''Geschwader''.<ref name=\"Luftwaffe Tactical Organisation\"/>\n\nA ''Jagdgeschwader'' (hunting wing) (JG) was a single-seat day fighter ''Geschwader'', typically equipped with Bf 109 or Fw 190 aircraft flying in the fighter or fighter-bomber roles. Late in the war, by 1944\u201345, [[JG 7]] and [[JG 400]] (and the jet specialist [[JV 44]]) flew much more advanced aircraft, with [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|JG 1]] [[Heinkel He 162|working up with jets]] at war's end. A ''Geschwader'' consisted of groups (''Gruppen''), which in turn consisted of ''Jagdstaffel'' (fighter squadrons). Hence, Fighter Wing 1 was JG 1, its first ''Gruppe'' (group) was I./JG 1, using a [[Roman numeral]] for the ''Gruppe'' number only, and its first ''Staffel'' (squadron) was 1./JG 1. ''Geschwader'' strength was usually 120 \u2013 125 aircraft.<ref name=\"Luftwaffe Tactical Organisation\"/>\n\nEach ''Gruppe'' was commanded by a ''Kommandeur'', and a ''Staffel'' by a ''Staffelkapit\u00e4n''. However, these were \"appointments\", not ranks, within the ''Luftwaffe''. Usually, the ''Kommodore'' would hold the rank of ''Oberstleutnant'' (lieutenant colonel) or, exceptionally, an ''Oberst'' (colonel). Even a ''Leutnant'' (second lieutenant) could find himself commanding a ''Staffel''.\n\nSimilarly, a bomber wing was a ''Kampfgeschwader'' (KG), a night fighter wing was a ''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' (NJG), a dive bomber wing was a ''Stukageschwader'' (StG), and units equivalent to those in RAF Coastal Command, with specific responsibilities for coastal patrols and search and rescue duties, were ''K\u00fcstenfliegergruppen'' (K\u00fc.Fl. Gr.). Specialist bomber groups were known as ''Kampfgruppen'' (KGr). The strength of a bomber ''Geschwader'' was about 80\u201390 aircraft.<ref name=\"Luftwaffe Tactical Organisation\"/>\n\n===Personnel===\n{{See also|Luftwaffe personnel structure|Ranks and insignia of the Luftwaffe (1935\u20131945)}}\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|colspan=2|'''''Luftwaffe strength during the fall of 1941'''''\n|-\n! align=\"left\" width=\"50\" | '''Forces'''\n! align=\"left\" width=\"50\" | '''Personnel strength'''\n|-\n| Flying units \n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 500,000\n|-\n| Anti-aircraft units \n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 500,000\n|-\n| Air signal units \n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 250,000\n|-\n| Construction units \n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 150,000\n|-\n| ''[[Landsturm]]'' (militia) units \n|style=\"text-align: right;\"| 36,000\n|-\n|colspan=2|Source:<ref name=\"Zentner\">{{harvnb|Zentner|1963|p=325}}</ref>\n|}\nThe peacetime strength of the ''Luftwaffe'' in the spring of 1939 was 370,000 men.

It helped the ''[[Falange]]'' under [[Francisco Franco]] to defeat the Republican forces. Over 20,000 German airmen gained combat experience that would give the ''Luftwaffe'' an important advantage going into the Second World War. One infamous operation was the bombing of [[Guernica]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]]. It is commonly assumed this attack was the result of a \"terror doctrine\" in ''Luftwaffe'' doctrine. The raids on Guernica and [[Madrid]] caused many civilian casualties and a wave of protests in the democracies. It has been suggested that the bombing of Guernica was carried out for military tactical reasons, in support of ground operations, but the town was not directly involved in any fighting at that point in time. It was not until 1942 that the Germans started to develop bombing policy in which civilians were the primary target, although [[The Blitz]] on London and many other British cities involved indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas,<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 7\"/> 'nuisance raids' which could even involve the machine-gunning of civilians and livestock.<ref>{{harvnb|Neitzel|Weltzer|2012|pp=57\u201358}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWhen World War II began, the ''Luftwaffe'' was one of the most technologically advanced air forces in the world. During the [[Polish Campaign]] that triggered the war, it quickly established air superiority, and then air supremacy. It supported the German Army operations which ended the campaign in five weeks. The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s performance was as OKL had hoped. The ''Luftwaffe'' rendered invaluable support to the army,<ref>{{harvnb|Hooton|2007b|p=93}}</ref> mopping up pockets of resistance.

Hitler had already ordered preparations to be made for [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nIn spring 1941, the ''Luftwaffe'' helped its [[Axis powers|Axis]] partner, Italy, secure victory in the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]] and continued to support Italy in the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres]] until May 1945.\n\nIn June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The ''Luftwaffe'' destroyed thousands of Soviet aircraft, yet it failed to destroy the [[Red Air Force]] altogether. Lacking strategic bombers (the very \"Ural bombers\" that General Wever had asked for six years before) the ''Luftwaffe'' could not strike at Soviet production centers regularly or with the needed force.<ref>{{harvnb|Killen|2003|pp=171\u2013184}}</ref> As the war dragged on, the ''Luftwaffe'' was eroded in strength.

The mounting demands of the [[Defence of the Reich]] campaign gradually destroyed the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s fighter arm. Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket propelled aircraft for bomber destroyer duties, it was overwhelmed by Allied numbers and a lack of trained pilots and fuel. A last-ditch attempt, known as [[Operation Bodenplatte]], to win air superiority on 1 January 1945 failed.

The ''Luftwaffe'' lacked an effective air defence system early in the war. [[Adolf Hitler]]'s foreign policy had pushed Germany into war before these defences could be fully developed. The ''Luftwaffe'' was forced to improvise and construct its defences during the war.\n\nThe daylight actions over German controlled territory were sparse in 1939\u20131940. The responsibility of the defence of German air space fell to the ''Luftgaukommandos'' (air district commands). The defence systems relied mostly on the \"flak\" arm. The defences were not coordinated and communication was poor. This lack of understanding between the flak and flying branches of the defence would plague the ''Luftwaffe'' throughout the war.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 42\">{{harvnb|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=42}}</ref> Hitler in particular wanted the defence to rest on anti-aircraft artillery as it gave the civilian population a \"psychological crutch\" no matter how ineffective the weapons.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 132\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=132}}</ref>\n\nMost of the battles fought by the ''Luftwaffe'' on the Western Front were against [[Circus offensive|the RAF's \"Circus\" raids]] and the occasional daylight raid into German air space. This was a fortunate position since the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s strategy of focusing its striking power on one front started to unravel with the failure of the invasion of the Soviet Union. The \"peripheral\" strategy of the ''Luftwaffe'' between 1939 and 1940 had been to deploy its fighter defences at the edges of Axis occupied territory, with little protecting the inner depths.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 46\">{{harvnb|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=46}}</ref> Moreover, the front line units in the West were complaining about the poor numbers and performance of aircraft. Units complained of lack of ''Zerst\u00f6rer'' aircraft with all-weather capabilities and the \"lack of climbing power of the Bf 109\".<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 46\" /> The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s technical edge was slipping as the only formidable new aircraft in the German arsenal was the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]. ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' Erhard Milch was to assist Ernst Udet with aircraft production increases and introduction of more modern types of fighter aircraft. However, they explained at a meeting of the Reich Industrial Council on 18 September 1941 that the new next generation aircraft had failed to materialize, and production of obsolete types had to continue to meet the growing need for replacements.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 46\" />\n\nThe buildup of the ''[[Jagdwaffe]]'' (\"Fighter Force\") was too rapid and its quality suffered. It was not put under a unified command until 1943, which also affected performance of the nine ''Jagdgeschwader'' fighter wings in existence in 1939. No further units were formed until 1942, and the years of 1940\u20131941 were wasted. OKL failed to construct a strategy; instead its command style was reactionary, and its measures not as effective without thorough planning. This was particularly apparent with the ''[[Sturmb\u00f6ck]]'' squadrons, formed to replace the increasingly ineffective twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rer'' twin-engined heavy fighter wings as the primary defense against USAAF daylight raids. The ''Sturmb\u00f6cke''\nflew Fw 190A fighters armed with heavy 20&nbsp;mm and 30&nbsp;mm cannon to destroy heavy bombers, but this increased the weight and affected the performance of the Fw 190 at a time when the aircraft were meeting large numbers of equal if not superior Allied types.<ref>{{harvnb|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=286}}</ref>\n\nDaytime aerial defense against the USAAF's strongly defended heavy bomber forces, particularly the [[Eighth Air Force]] and the [[Fifteenth Air Force]], had its successes through the calendar year of 1943. But at the start of 1944, [[Jimmy Doolittle#Doolittle's breakthrough in fighter tactics|Eighth AF commander Jimmy Doolittle made a major change in offensive fighter tactics]], which defeated the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s day fighter force from that time onwards. Steadily increasing numbers of the superlative [[North American P-51 Mustang]] single-engine fighter, leading the USAAF's bombers into German airspace defeated first the [[Heavy fighter#Germany|Bf 110 ''Zerst\u00f6rer'']] wings, then the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|Fw 190A Sturmb\u00f6cke]].\n\n===Development and equipment===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-668-7161-31A, Flugzeug Heinkel He 177.jpg|thumb|left|The most troublesome of all German designs during WW II \u2013 both in development and in service \u2013 was the [[Heinkel He 177|He 177]]A ''Greif'' heavy bomber.]]\nIn terms of technological development, the failure to develop a long-range bomber and capable long-range fighters during this period left the ''Luftwaffe'' unable to conduct a meaningful strategic bombing campaign throughout the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007|p=118}}</ref> However, Germany at that time suffered from limitations in raw materials such as oil and aluminium, which meant that there were insufficient resources for much beyond a tactical air force: given these circumstances, the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s reliance on tactical mid-range, twin engined medium bombers and short range dive-bombers was a pragmatic choice of strategy.<ref>{{harvnb|Homze|1976|p=123}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007|p=108}}</ref> It might also be argued that the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s ''Kampfgeschwader'' medium and heavy bomber wings were perfectly capable of attacking strategic targets, but the lack of capable long range escort fighters left the bombers unable to carry out their missions effectively against determined and well organised fighter opposition.<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 282\">{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=282}}</ref>\n\nThe greatest failure for the ''Kampfgeschwader'', however, was being saddled with an aircraft intended as a capable four-engined heavy bomber: the perpetually troubled [[Heinkel He 177]], whose engines were [[Heinkel He 177#Engine difficulties|prone to catch fire]] in flight. Of the [[Heinkel He 277#Trio of separate efforts|three parallel proposals]] from the Heinkel engineering departments for a four engined version of the A-series He 177 [[Heinkel He 277#Trio of separate efforts|by February 1943]], only one, the [[Heinkel He 177#Further development: the Heinkel He 177B|He 177B]], emerged in the concluding months of 1943. Only three airworthy prototypes of the B-series He 177 design were produced by early 1944, some three years after the first prototype flights of the [[Avro Lancaster]], the most successful RAF heavy bomber.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-043-02, Focke-Wulf Fw 200 C Condor.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Arguably, one of the greatest tactical failures was the neglect of naval aviation in the western theatre, 1939\u20131941. (pictured is a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] C Condor)]]\n\nAnother failure of procurement and equipment was the lack of a dedicated [[Naval aviation|naval air arm]]. General Felmy had already expressed a desire to build a naval air arm to support ''Kriegsmarine'' operations in the Atlantic and British waters. Britain was dependent on food and raw materials from its Empire and North America. Felmy pressed this case firmly throughout 1938 and 1939, and, on 31 October 1939, ''[[Gro\u00dfadmiral]]'' [[Erich Raeder]] sent a strongly worded letter to G\u00f6ring in support of such proposals. The early-war twin-engined [[Heinkel He 115]] floatplane and [[Dornier Do 18]] [[flying boat]] were too slow and short-ranged. The then-contemporary [[Blohm & Voss BV 138]] ''Seedrache'' (seadragon) trimotor flying boat became the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s primary seaborne maritime patrol platform, with nearly 300 examples built; its trio of [[Junkers Jumo 205]] diesel engines gave it a 4,300&nbsp;km (2,670&nbsp;mi) maximum range. Another Blohm und Voss design of 1940, the enormous, 46-meter wingspan six-engined [[Blohm und Voss BV 222]] ''Wiking'' maritime patrol flying boat, would see it capable of a 6,800&nbsp;km (4,200-mile) range at maximum endurance when using higher-output versions of the same [[Jumo 205]] powerplants as used by the BV 138, in later years. The [[Dornier Do 217]] would have been ideal as a land-based choice, but suffered production problems. Raeder also complained about the poor standard of aerial torpedoes, although their design was the responsibility of the ''Wehrmacht'' combined military's naval arm (the ''Kriegsmarine''), even considering production of the Japanese [[Type 91 torpedo#Provision of the aerial torpedo technology to Germany|Type 91 torpedo]] used at [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] as the ''Lufttorpedo'' '''LT 850''' by August 1942. (See both:[[Yanagi missions]] and [[Heinkel He 111 operational history#Torpedo bomber operations|Heinkel He 111 torpedo bomber operations]])<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1997|p=281}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-yanagi-missions-japans-underwater-convoys.htm |title=World War II: Yanagi Missions \u2013 Japan's Underwater Convoys |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=12 June 2006 |website=historynet.com |publisher=Historynet.com |accessdate=12 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402094746/http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-yanagi-missions-japans-underwater-convoys.htm |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWithout specialised naval or land-based, purpose-designed maritime patrol aircraft, the ''Luftwaffe'' was forced to improvise. The [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] Condor airliner's airframe \u2013 engineered for civilian airliner use \u2013 lacked the structural strength for combat maneuvering at lower altitudes, making it unsuitable for use as a bomber in maritime patrol duties. The Condor lacked speed, armour and bomb load capacity. Sometimes the fuselage literally \"broke its back\" or a wing panel dropped loose from the [[wing root]] after a hard landing. Nevertheless, this civilian transport was adapted for the long-range reconnaissance and anti-shipping roles and, between August 1940 and February 1941, Fw 200s sank 85 vessels for a claimed total of 363,000 Grt. Had the ''Luftwaffe'' focused on naval aviation \u2013 particularly maritime patrol aircraft with long range, like the aforementioned diesel-powered multi-engine Blohm & Voss flying boats \u2013 Germany might well have been in a position to win the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. However, Raeder and the ''Kriegsmarine'' failed to press for naval air power until the war began, mitigating the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s responsibility. In addition, G\u00f6ring regarded any other branch of the German military developing its own aviation as an encroachment on his authority and continually frustrated the Navy's attempts to build its own airpower.<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 282\"/>\n\nThe absence of a strategic bomber force for the ''Luftwaffe'', following General Wever's accidental death in the early summer of 1936 and the end of the [[Ural bomber]] program he fostered before the invasion of Poland, would not be addressed again until the authorization of the \"[[Bomber B]]\" design competition in July 1939, which sought to replace the medium bomber force with which the ''Luftwaffe'' was to begin the war, and the partly achieved ''[[Schnellbomber]]'' high-speed medium bomber concept with more advanced, twin-engined high speed bomber aircraft fitted with pairs of relatively [[Bomber B#High-output engines|\"high-power\" engines]] of 1,500&nbsp;kW (2,000&nbsp;hp) output levels and upwards each as a follow-on to the earlier ''Schnellbomber'' project, that would also be able to function as shorter range heavy bombers. [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B19957, Edgar Petersen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|''Oberst'' [[Edgar Petersen]], the head of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s ''Erprobungsstellen'' network of test facilities late in the war]] The spring 1942 ''[[Amerika Bomber]]'' program also sought to produce useful strategic bomber designs for the ''Luftwaffe'', with their prime design priority being an advanced trans-oceanic range capability as the main aim of the project to directly attack the United States from Europe or the Azores. Inevitably, both the Bomber B and Amerika Bomber programs were victims of the continued emphasis of the ''Wehrmacht'' combined military's insistence for its ''Luftwaffe'' air arm to support the ''Heer'' as its primary mission, and the damage to the German aviation industry from Allied bomber attacks.\n\n====Challenges in directly addressing combat pilots' issues====\nThe RLM's apparent lack of a dedicated \"technical-tactical\" department, that would have directly been in contact with combat pilots to assess their needs for weaponry upgrades and tactical advice, had never been seriously envisioned as a critically ongoing necessity in the planning of the original German air arm.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\">{{harvnb|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=287}}</ref> The RLM did have its own ''Technisches Amt'' (T-Amt) department to handle aviation technology issues, but this was tasked with handling all aviation technology issues in the Third Reich, both military and civilian in nature, and also not known to have ever had any clear and actively administrative and consultative links with the front-line forces established for such purposes. On the front-line combat side of the issue, and for direct contact with the German aviation firms making the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s warplanes, the ''Luftwaffe'' did have its own reasonably effective system of four military aviation test facilities, or ''Erprobungstellen'' located at three coastal sites \u2013 [[Peenem\u00fcnde Airfield|Peenem\u00fcnde-West]] (also incorporating a separate facility in nearby [[Karlshagen]]), [[Tarnewitz test site|Tarnewitz]] and [[Priwall Peninsula|Travem\u00fcnde]] \u2013 and the central inland site of [[Rechlin-L\u00e4rz Airfield|Rechlin]], itself first established as a military airfield in late August 1918 by the German Empire, with the four-facility system commanded later in World War II by ''Oberst'' (Colonel) [[Edgar Petersen]]. However, due to lack of co-ordination between the RLM and OKL, all fighter and bomber development was oriented toward short range aircraft, as they could be produced in greater numbers, rather than quality long range aircraft, something that put the ''Luftwaffe'' at a disadvantage [[Aircraft of the Battle of Britain#German fighter fuel capacity|as early as the Battle of Britain]].<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/> The \"ramp-up\" to production levels required to fulfill the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s front-line needs was also slow, not reaching maximum output until 1944.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/> Production of fighters was not given priority until 1944; [[Adolf Galland]] commented that this should have occurred at least a year earlier.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/> Galland also pointed to the mistakes and challenges made in the development of the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet \u2013 which included the protracted development time required for its [[Junkers Jumo 004]] jet engines to achieve reliability. German combat aircraft types that were first designed and flown in the mid-1930s had become obsolete, yet were kept in production, in particular the Ju 87 Stuka, and the Bf 109, because there were no well-developed replacement designs.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/>\n\n===Production failures===\nThe failure of German production was evident from the start of the Battle of Britain. By the end of 1940 the ''Luftwaffe'' had suffered heavy losses and needed to regroup. Deliveries of new aircraft were insufficient to meet the drain on resources; the ''Luftwaffe'', unlike the RAF, was failing to expand its pilot and aircraft numbers.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 32\">{{harvnb|Overy|1980|p=32}}</ref> This was partly owing to production planning failures before the war and the demands of the army. Nevertheless, the German aircraft industry was being outproduced in 1940. In terms of fighter aircraft production, the British exceeded their production plans by 43%, while the Germans remained 40% \"behind\" target by the summer 1940. In fact German production in fighters fell from 227 to 177 per month between July and September 1940.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 32\"/> One of the many reasons for the failure of the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1940 was that it did not have the operational and material means to destroy the British aircraft industry,<ref>{{harvnb|Overy|1980|p=33}}</ref> something that the much-anticipated ''Bomber B'' design competition was intended to address.\n\nThe so-called \"G\u00f6ring program\", had largely been predicated on the defeat of the Soviet Union in 1941. After the ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s failure in front of Moscow, industrial priorities for a possibility in increasing aircraft production were largely abandoned in favor to support the army's increased attrition rates and heavy equipment losses.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 133\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=133}}</ref> Erhard Milch's reforms expanded production rates. In 1941 an average of 981 aircraft (including 311 fighters) were produced each month.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 133\" /> In 1942 this rose to 1,296 aircraft of which 434 were fighters.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 133\" /> Milch's planned production increases were initially opposed. But in June, he was granted materials for 900 fighters per month as the average output. By the Summer of 1942, ''Luftwaffe's'' operational fighter force had recovered from a low of 39% (44% for fighters and 31% for bombers) in Winter of 1941\u20131942, to 69% by late June (75% for fighters and 66% for bombers) in 1942. However, after increased commitments in the east, overall operational ready rates fluctuated between 59% and 65% for the remaining year.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 138\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=138}}</ref> Throughout 1942 the ''Luftwaffe'' was out produced in fighter aircraft by 250% and in twin-engine aircraft by 196%.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 139\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|p=139}}</ref>\n\nThe appointment of [[Albert Speer]] as Minister of Armaments increased production of existing designs, and the few new designs that had originated from earlier in the war. However the intensification of Allied bombing caused the dispersion of production and prevented an efficient acceleration of expansion. German aviation production reached about 36,000 combat aircraft for 1944. However, by the time this was achieved the ''Luftwaffe'' lacked the fuel and trained pilots to make this achievement worth while.<ref name=\"Murray 1983, pp. 253-255\">{{harvnb|Murray|1983|pp=253\u2013255}}</ref>\n\nThe failure to maximize production immediately after the failures in the Soviet Union and North Africa ensured the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s effective defeat in the period of September 1943 \u2013 February 1944. Despite the tactical victories won, they failed to achieve a decisive victory. By the time production reached acceptable levels, as so many other factors had for the ''Luftwaffe'' \u2013 and for the entire ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s weapons and ordnance technology as a whole \u2013 late in the war, it was \"too little, too late\".<ref name=\"Murray 1983, pp. 253-255\" />\n\n===Engine development===\nBy the late 1930s, [[airframe]] construction methods had progressed to the point where airframes could be built to any required size, founded on the all-metal airframe design technologies pioneered by [[Hugo Junkers]] [[Junkers J 1|in 1915]] and constantly improved upon for over two decades to follow \u2013 especially in Germany with aircraft like the [[Dornier Do X]] flying boat and the [[Junkers G 38]] airliner. However, powering such designs was a major challenge. Mid-1930s aero engines were limited to about 600&nbsp;hp and the first 1000&nbsp;hp engines were just entering the prototype stage \u2013 for the then-new Third Reich's ''Luftwaffe'' air arm, this meant inverted liquid-cooled V12 designs like the [[Daimler-Benz DB 601]].\n\nThe [[United States]] had already gotten its start towards this goal by 1937 with two large displacement, twin-row 18-cylinder air-cooled radial engine designs of at least 46 litres (2,800 in{{sup|3}}) displacement each: the [[Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp#Design and development|Pratt & Whitney ''Double Wasp'']] and the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright ''Duplex-Cyclone'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.468thbombgroup.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=sPINPiUsDfI%3D&tabid=36&mid=467 |title=B-29 Design/Devemopment \u2013 Engines |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=468thbombgroup.org |accessdate=1 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630172931/http://468thbombgroup.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=sPINPiUsDfI%3d&tabid=36&mid=467 |archive-date=30 June 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nNazi Germany's initial need for substantially more powerful aviation engines originated with the private venture [[Heinkel He 119]] high-speed reconnaissance design, and the ostensibly twin-\"engined\" [[Messerschmitt Me 261]] for maritime reconnaissance duties \u2013 to power each of these designs, Daimler-Benz literally \"doubled-up\" their new, fuel-injected DB 601 engines. This \"doubling-up\" involved placing two DB 601s side-by-side on either side of a common vertical-plane space frame with their crankcases' outer sides each having a mount similar to what would be used in a single-engine installation, creating a \"mirror-image\" centrifugal supercharger for the starboard-side component DB 601, inclining the top ends of their crankcases inwards by roughly 30\u00ba to mate with the space-frame central mount, and placing a common propeller gear reduction housing across the front ends of the two engines. Such a twin-crankcased \"power system\" aviation engine crafted from a pair of DB 601s resulted in the 2,700 PS (1,986&nbsp;kW) maximum output DB 606 \"coupled\" engine design for these two aircraft in February 1937, but with each of the DB 606 \"coupled\" engines weighing in at around 1.5 tonnes apiece.<ref name=weldedtogether-606>{{harvnb|Griehl|Dressel|1998|p=224}}</ref>\n\nThe early development of the DB 606 \"coupled\" engines, was paralleled during the late 1930s with Daimler-Benz's simultaneous development of a 1,500&nbsp;kW class engine design using a single crankcase. The result was the twenty-four cylinder [[Daimler-Benz DB 604]] [[X engine|X-configuration]] engine, with four banks of six cylinders each.

''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), pp.80\u201381.</ref> The two closest Allied equivalents to the 801 in configuration and displacement \u2013 the American [[Wright R-2600#Variants|Wright ''Twin Cyclone'']], and the Soviet [[Shvetsov ASh-82#Variants|Shvetsov ASh-82]] radials \u2013 never had any need to be developed beyond a 1,500&nbsp;kW output level, as larger-displacement, 18-cylinder radial aviation engines in both nations (the aforementioned American ''Double Wasp'' and ''Duplex-Cyclone'') and the eventual 1945 premiere of the Soviet [[Shvetsov ASh-73]] design, all three of which started their development before 1940, handled needs for even greater power from large radial aviation engines.\n\nThe twinned-up [[Daimler-Benz DB 601]]-based, 1,750&nbsp;kW output DB 606, and its more powerful descendant, the 2,130&nbsp;kW output DB 605-based DB 610, weighing some 1.5 tonnes apiece, were the only 1,500&nbsp;kW-plus output level aircraft powerplants to ever be produced by Germany for ''Luftwaffe'' combat aircraft, mostly for the aforementioned Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber. Even the largest-displacement inverted V12 aircraft powerplant built in Germany, the 44.52-litre (2,717 cu. in.) [[Daimler-Benz DB 603]], which saw widespread use in twin-engined designs, could not exceed the 1,500&nbsp;kW output level without more development. By March 1940, even the DB 603 was being \"twinned-up\"<ref name=weldedtogether-606 /> as the 601/606 and 605/610 had been, to become their replacement \"power system\": this was the strictly experimental, approximately 1.8-tonne weight apiece, twin-crankcase DB 613; capable of over 2,570&nbsp;kW (3,495 PS) output, but which never left its test phase.\n\nThe proposed over-1,500&nbsp;kW output subtypes of German aviation industry's existing piston aviation engine designs\u2014which adhered to using just a single crankcase that ''were'' able to substantially exceed the aforementioned over-1,500&nbsp;kW output level\u2014were the DB 603 LM (1,800&nbsp;kW at take-off, in production), the DB 603 N (2,205&nbsp;kW at take-off, planned for 1946) and the BMW 801F (1,765&nbsp;kW (2,400 PS) engines. The pioneering nature of jet engine technology in the 1940s resulted in numerous development problems for both of Germany's major jet engine designs to see mass production, the [[Jumo 004]] and [[BMW 003]] (both of pioneering [[Axial-flow compressor|axial flow]] design), with the more powerful [[Heinkel HeS 011]] never leaving the test phase, as only 19 examples of the HeS 011 would ever be built for development.<ref>Christopher, John. ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes''. The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013. p. 74.</ref> Even with such dismal degrees of success for such advanced aviation powerplant designs, more and more design proposals for new German combat aircraft in the 1943\u201345 period centered either around the failed Jumo 222 or HeS 011 aviation powerplants for their propulsion.\n\n===Personnel and leadership===\nThe bomber arm was given preference and received the \"better\" pilots. Later, fighter pilot leaders were few in numbers as a result of this. As with the late shift to fighter production, the ''Luftwaffe'' pilot schools did not give the fighter pilot schools preference soon enough. The ''Luftwaffe'', OKW argued, was still an offensive weapon, and its primary focus was on producing bomber pilots. This attitude prevailed until the second half of 1943.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/> During the [[Defence of the Reich]] campaign in 1943 and 1944, there were not enough commissioned fighter pilots and leaders to meet attrition rates;<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/> as the need arose to replace aircrew (as attrition rates increased), the quality of [[Defence of the Reich#Pilot selection and training|pilot training deteriorated]] rapidly. Later this was made worse by [[Oil Campaign of World War II|fuel shortages for pilot training]]. Overall this meant reduced training on operational types, formation flying, gunnery training, and combat training, and a total lack of instrument training.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of the war commanders were replaced with younger commanders too quickly. These younger commanders had to learn \"in the field\" rather than entering a post fully qualified. Training of formation leaders was not systematic until 1943, which was far too late, with the ''Luftwaffe'' already stretched. The ''Luftwaffe'' thus lacked a cadre of staff officers to set up, man, and pass on experience.<ref name=\"Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 287\"/>\n\nMoreover, ''Luftwaffe'' leadership from the start poached the training command, which undermined its ability to replace losses,<ref name=\"Ketley and Rolfe, p. 4\" /> while also planning for \"short sharp campaigns\",<ref name=\"Ketley and Rolfe, p. 8\">{{harvnb|Ketley|Rolfe |1996|p=8}}</ref> which did not pertain. Moreover, no plans were laid for [[night fighter]]s.<ref name=\"Ketley and Rolfe, p. 8\"/> In fact, when protests were raised, [[Hans Jeschonnek]], Chief of the General Staff of the ''Luftwaffe'', said, \"First we've got to beat Russia, then we can start training!\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ketley|Rolfe |1996|loc=quoted p. 4}}</ref>\n\n==''Luftwaffe'' ground forces==\nOne of the unique characteristics of the ''Luftwaffe'' (as opposed to other independent air forces) was the possession of an organic [[paratrooper]] force called ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]''. Eestablished in 1938, they saw action in their proper role during 1940\u20131941, most notably in the capture of the Belgian Army fortress at the [[Battle of Fort Eben-Emael]] and the [[Battle for The Hague]] in May 1940, and during the [[Battle of Crete]] in May 1941. However, more than 4,000 ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' were killed during the Crete operation.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayer|Taylor|1974|p=95}}</ref> Afterwards, although continuing to be trained in parachute delivery, paratroopers were only used in a parachute role for smaller-scale operations, such as [[Gran Sasso raid|the rescue of Benito Mussolini in 1943]]. ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' formations were mainly used as crack foot infantry in all theatres of the war. Their losses were 22,041 KIA, 57,594 WIA and 44,785 MIA (until February 1945).<ref name=\"Hahn, Fritz 1945\"/>\n\nDuring 1942 surplus ''Luftwaffe'' personnel (see above) was used to form the [[Luftwaffe Field Division|''Luftwaffe'' Field Division]]s, standard infantry divisions that were used chiefly as [[bandit fighting|rear echelon units]] to free up front line troops. From 1943, the ''Luftwaffe'' also had an armoured paratroop division called [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|''Fallschirm-Panzer'' Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring]], which was expanded to a ''[[Panzerkorps]]'' in 1944.\n\nGround support and combat units from the ''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'' (RAD) and the [[National Socialist Motor Corps]] (NSKK) were also put at the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s disposal during the war. In 1942 56 RAD companies served with the ''Luftwaffe'' in the West as airfield construction troops. In 1943 420 RAD companies were trained as [[anti-aircraft artillery]] (AAA) and posted to existing ''Luftwaffe'' AAA battalions in the homeland. At the end of the war, these units were also fighting allied tanks. Beginning in 1939 with a transport regiment, the NSKK had in 1942 a complete division sized transportation unit serving the ''Luftwaffe'', the ''NSKK Transportgruppe Luftwaffe'' serving in France and at the Eastern front. The overwhelming number of its 12,000 members were Belgian, Dutch and French citizens.<ref>Thomas, Nigel & Caballero Jurado, Carlos (1992). ''Wehrmacht Auxiliary Forces''.

It listed all the targets of the bombing, which included: the royal palace, the war ministry, military headquarters, the central post office, the telegraph office, passenger and goods railway stations, power stations and barracks.

His proposal of a positive volume charge reflects the nature of his scientific approach to discovery which was to propose ideas to guide future experiments.\n\nIn this model, the orbits of the electrons were stable because when an electron moved away from the centre of the positively-charged sphere, it was subjected to a greater net positive inward force, because there was more positive charge inside its orbit (see [[Gauss's law]]). Electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions among the electrons, and spectroscopic measurements were meant to account for energy differences associated with different electron rings. Thomson attempted unsuccessfully to reshape his model to account for some of the major [[spectroscopy|spectral lines]] experimentally known for several elements.{{fact|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe plum pudding model usefully guided his student, [[Ernest Rutherford]], to devise experiments to further explore the composition of atoms. Also, Thomson's model (along with a similar [[Saturnian model|Saturnian ring model for atomic electrons]] put forward in 1904 by [[Hantaro Nagaoka|Nagaoka]] after [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s [[Rings of Saturn#History|model of Saturn's rings]]) were useful predecessors of the more correct solar-system-like [[Bohr model]] of the atom.\n\nThe colloquial nickname \"plum pudding\" was soon attributed to Thomson's model as the distribution of electrons within its positively-charged region of space reminded many scientists of [[raisins]], then called \"plums,\" in the common English dessert, [[plum pudding]].\n\nIn 1909, [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]] conducted [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment|experiments with thin sheets of gold]]. Their professor, Ernest Rutherford, expected to find results consistent with Thomson's atomic model. It was not until 1911 that Rutherford correctly interpreted the experiment's results<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Angelo |first=Joseph A. \n |year=2004\n |title=Nuclear Technology\n |page=110 <!--maybe also pg 68? \nAlso, this source only says that the experiments began in 1909 and that Rutherford _published_ the results in 1911, nothing about when he interpreted the results.

This led to the development of the [[Rutherford model]] of the atom. Immediately after Rutherford published his results, [[Antonius Van den Broek]] made the intuitive proposal that the atomic number of an atom is the total number of units of charge present in its nucleus. [[Henry Moseley]]'s 1913 experiments (see [[Moseley's law]]) provided the necessary evidence to support Van den Broek's proposal. The effective nuclear charge was found to be consistent with the atomic number (Moseley found only one unit of charge difference). This work culminated in the solar-system-like (but quantum-limited) [[Bohr model]] of the atom in the same year, in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charges is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells. As Thomson's model guided Rutherford's experiments, Bohr's model guided Moseley's research.\n\n==Related scientific problems==\nThe plum pudding model with a single electron was used in part by the physicist [[Arthur Erich Haas]] in 1910 to estimate the numerical value of [[Planck's constant]] and the [[Bohr radius]] of hydrogen atoms. Haas' work estimated these values to within an order of magnitude and preceded the work of [[Niels Bohr]] by three years. Of note, the [[Bohr model]] itself provides reasonable predictions only for [[atom]]ic and [[ion]]ic systems with just one effective electron.\n\nA particularly useful mathematics problem related to the plum pudding model is the optimal distribution of equal point charges on a unit sphere, called the [[Thomson problem]]. The Thomson problem is a natural consequence of the plum pudding model in the absence of its uniform positive background charge.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Levin |first1=Y. |last2=Arenzon |first2=J.

His proposal of a positive volume charge reflects the nature of his scientific approach to discovery which was to propose ideas to guide future experiments.\n\nIn this model, the orbits of the electrons were stable because when an electron moved away from the centre of the positively-charged sphere, it was subjected to a greater net positive inward force, because there was more positive charge inside its orbit (see [[Gauss's law]]). Electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions among the electrons, and spectroscopic measurements were meant to account for energy differences associated with different electron rings. Thomson attempted unsuccessfully to reshape his model to account for some of the major [[spectroscopy|spectral lines]] experimentally known for several elements.{{fact|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe plum pudding model usefully guided his student, [[Ernest Rutherford]], to devise experiments to further explore the composition of atoms. Also, Thomson's model (along with a similar [[Saturnian model|Saturnian ring model for atomic electrons]] put forward in 1904 by [[Hantaro Nagaoka|Nagaoka]] after [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s [[Rings of Saturn#History|model of Saturn's rings]]) were useful predecessors of the more correct solar-system-like [[Bohr model]] of the atom.\n\nThe colloquial nickname \"plum pudding\" was soon attributed to Thomson's model as the distribution of electrons within its positively-charged region of space reminded many scientists of [[raisins]], then called \"plums,\" in the common English dessert, [[plum pudding]].\n\nIn 1909, [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]] conducted [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment|experiments with thin sheets of gold]]. Their professor, Ernest Rutherford, expected to find results consistent with Thomson's atomic model. It was not until 1911 that Rutherford correctly interpreted the experiment's results<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Angelo |first=Joseph A. \n |year=2004\n |title=Nuclear Technology\n |page=110 <!--maybe also pg 68? \nAlso, this source only says that the experiments began in 1909 and that Rutherford _published_ the results in 1911, nothing about when he interpreted the results.

This led to the development of the [[Rutherford model]] of the atom. Immediately after Rutherford published his results, [[Antonius Van den Broek]] made the intuitive proposal that the atomic number of an atom is the total number of units of charge present in its nucleus. [[Henry Moseley]]'s 1913 experiments (see [[Moseley's law]]) provided the necessary evidence to support Van den Broek's proposal. The effective nuclear charge was found to be consistent with the atomic number (Moseley found only one unit of charge difference). This work culminated in the solar-system-like (but quantum-limited) [[Bohr model]] of the atom in the same year, in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charges is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells. As Thomson's model guided Rutherford's experiments, Bohr's model guided Moseley's research.\n\n==Related scientific problems==\nThe plum pudding model with a single electron was used in part by the physicist [[Arthur Erich Haas]] in 1910 to estimate the numerical value of [[Planck's constant]] and the [[Bohr radius]] of hydrogen atoms. Haas' work estimated these values to within an order of magnitude and preceded the work of [[Niels Bohr]] by three years. Of note, the [[Bohr model]] itself provides reasonable predictions only for [[atom]]ic and [[ion]]ic systems with just one effective electron.\n\nA particularly useful mathematics problem related to the plum pudding model is the optimal distribution of equal point charges on a unit sphere, called the [[Thomson problem]]. The Thomson problem is a natural consequence of the plum pudding model in the absence of its uniform positive background charge.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Levin |first1=Y. |last2=Arenzon |first2=J.

The electrostatic N-electron configurations are found to be exceptionally close to solutions found in the Thomson problem with electrons residing at the same radius within the dielectric sphere. Notably, the plotted distribution of geometry-dependent energetics has been shown to bear a remarkable resemblance to the distribution of anticipated electron orbitals in natural atoms as arranged on the [[periodic table]] of elements.<ref name=lafave/> Of great interest, solutions of the Thomson problem exhibit this corresponding energy distribution by comparing the energy of each N-electron solution with the energy of its neighbouring (N-1)-electron solution with one charge at the origin.
