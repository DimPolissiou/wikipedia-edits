''Magharebia''</ref> have been forged through economic cooperation, [[privatisation]] and industrial modernization.\n\nIn ancient times, Tunisia was primarily inhabited by [[Berbers]]. [[Phoenicia]]n immigration began in the 12th century BC; these immigrants founded [[Carthage]]. A major mercantile power and a military rival of the [[Roman Republic]], Carthage was [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|defeated]] by the Romans in 146 BC. The Romans occupied Tunisia for most of the next 800 years, introduced [[Christianity]] and left architectural legacies like the [[El Djem]] amphitheater.

The economy, mainly during the Empire, boomed: the prosperity of the area depended on agriculture. Called the ''Granary of the Empire'', the area of actual Tunisia and coastal [[Tripolitania]], according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one-quarter of which was exported to the Empire. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits.\n\nBy the 2nd century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item.

It is bordered by [[Algeria]] on the west and southwest and [[Libya]] on the south east. It lies between latitudes [[30th parallel north|30\u00b0]] and [[38th parallel north|38\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[7th meridian east|7\u00b0]] and [[12th meridian east|12\u00b0E]]. An abrupt southward turn of the Mediterranean coast in northern Tunisia gives the country two distinctive Mediterranean coasts, west\u2013east in the north, and north\u2013south in the east.\n\nThough it is relatively small in size, Tunisia has great environmental diversity due to its north\u2013south extent. Its east\u2013west extent is limited. Differences in Tunisia, like the rest of the Maghreb, are largely north\u2013south environmental differences defined by sharply decreasing rainfall southward from any point. The Dorsal, the eastern extension of the Atlas Mountains, runs across Tunisia in a northeasterly direction from the Algerian border in the west to the Cape Bon peninsula in the east. North of the Dorsal is the Tell, a region characterized by low, rolling hills and plains, again an extension of mountains to the west in Algeria. In the [[Khroumire|Khroumerie]], the northwestern corner of the Tunisian Tell, elevations reach {{convert|1050|m|ft}} and snow occurs in winter.\n\nThe [[Sahel, Tunisia|Sahel]], a broadening coastal plain along Tunisia's eastern Mediterranean coast, is among the world's premier areas of olive cultivation. Inland from the Sahel, between the Dorsal and a range of hills south of Gafsa, are the [[Steppes]]. Much of the southern region is [[semi-arid]] and [[desert]].\n\nTunisia has a coastline {{convert|1148|km|mi|}} long. In maritime terms, the country claims a contiguous zone of {{convert|24|nmi|1|lk=in}}, and a territorial sea of {{convert|12|nmi|1}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ewan W.|first=Anderson|title=International Boundaries: Geopolitical Atlas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7-menNPxREC&pg=PA816|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-375-0|page=816}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nTunisia's climate is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] in the north, with mild rainy winters and hot, dry summers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT000720 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209110533/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT000720 |archivedate= 9 February 2011 |title=Climate of Tunisia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The south of the country is desert.

It was founded in 1949 and brings together French and Tunisian Muslims, Christians and Jews. Pierre Boucherle was its main instigator, along with [[Yahia Turki]], [[Abdelaziz Gorgi]], [[Moses Elias Levy|Moses Levy]], Ammar Farhat, and Jules Lellouche. Given its doctrine, some members have therefore turned to the sources of aesthetic Arab-Muslim art: such as miniature Islamic architecture, etc. Expressionist paintings by Amara Debbache, Jellal Ben Abdallah, and Ali Ben Salem are recognized while abstract art captures the imagination of painters like Edgar Naccache, Nello Levy, and [[Hedi Turki]].<ref name=\"tangka3\">{{cite web|url=http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040510/http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archivedate= 7 October 2011 |title=Un pays pour les peintres |publisher=Guide Tangka |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter independence in 1956, the art movement in Tunisia was propelled by the dynamics of nation building and by artists serving the state.

The Romans occupied Tunisia for most of the next 800 years, introduced [[Christianity]] and left architectural legacies like the [[El Djem]] amphitheater.

Agricultural communities in the humid coastal plains of central Tunisia then were ancestors of today's [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes.\n\nIt was believed in ancient times that Africa was originally populated by [[Gaetuli]]ans and Libyans, both nomadic peoples.  According to the Roman historian [[Sallust]], the demigod Hercules died in Spain and his polyglot eastern army was left to settle the land, with some [[Human migration|migrating]] to Africa. Persians went to the West and intermarried with the Gaetulians and became the Numidians. The Medes settled and were known as Mauri, later Moors.<ref>Banjamin Isaac, The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity, Princeton University Press, 2013 p.147</ref>\n[[File:Carthage Holdings.png|alt=|thumb|[[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]-held territory before the first First Punic War]]\nThe Numidians and Moors belonged to the race from which the Berbers are descended.

Its coast was settled by [[Phoenicia]]ns starting as early as the 12th century BC ([[Bizerte]], [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]]). The city of [[Carthage]] was founded in the 9th century BC by Phoenicians. Legend says that [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] from Tyre, now in modern-day Lebanon, founded the city in 814 BC, as retold by the [[Greeks|Greek]] writer [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus of Tauromenium]]. The settlers of Carthage brought their culture and religion from Phoenicia, now present-day [[Lebanon]] and adjacent areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Administration/Committees/documents/TheCityofCarthage.pdf |title=The City of Carthage: From Dido to the Arab Conquest |date= |accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter the series of wars with Greek city-states of Sicily in the 5th century BC, Carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the Western [[Mediterranean]]. The people of Carthage worshipped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including [[Baal]] and [[Tanit]].

The climate is Mediterranean towards the coast in the north, while most of the country is desert.]]\n[[File:T\u00e9boursouk.jpg|thumb|left|View of the central Tunisian plateau at [[T\u00e9boursouk]]]]\nTunisia is situated on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of Northwest Africa, midway between the Atlantic Ocean and the [[Nile Delta]]. It is bordered by [[Algeria]] on the west and southwest and [[Libya]] on the south east. It lies between latitudes [[30th parallel north|30\u00b0]] and [[38th parallel north|38\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[7th meridian east|7\u00b0]] and [[12th meridian east|12\u00b0E]]. An abrupt southward turn of the Mediterranean coast in northern Tunisia gives the country two distinctive Mediterranean coasts, west\u2013east in the north, and north\u2013south in the east.\n\nThough it is relatively small in size, Tunisia has great environmental diversity due to its north\u2013south extent. Its east\u2013west extent is limited. Differences in Tunisia, like the rest of the Maghreb, are largely north\u2013south environmental differences defined by sharply decreasing rainfall southward from any point. The Dorsal, the eastern extension of the Atlas Mountains, runs across Tunisia in a northeasterly direction from the Algerian border in the west to the Cape Bon peninsula in the east. North of the Dorsal is the Tell, a region characterized by low, rolling hills and plains, again an extension of mountains to the west in Algeria. In the [[Khroumire|Khroumerie]], the northwestern corner of the Tunisian Tell, elevations reach {{convert|1050|m|ft}} and snow occurs in winter.\n\nThe [[Sahel, Tunisia|Sahel]], a broadening coastal plain along Tunisia's eastern Mediterranean coast, is among the world's premier areas of olive cultivation. Inland from the Sahel, between the Dorsal and a range of hills south of Gafsa, are the [[Steppes]]. Much of the southern region is [[semi-arid]] and [[desert]].\n\nTunisia has a coastline {{convert|1148|km|mi|}} long. In maritime terms, the country claims a contiguous zone of {{convert|24|nmi|1|lk=in}}, and a territorial sea of {{convert|12|nmi|1}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ewan W.|first=Anderson|title=International Boundaries: Geopolitical Atlas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7-menNPxREC&pg=PA816|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-375-0|page=816}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nTunisia's climate is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] in the north, with mild rainy winters and hot, dry summers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT000720 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209110533/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT000720 |archivedate= 9 February 2011 |title=Climate of Tunisia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The south of the country is desert.

It was founded in 1949 and brings together French and Tunisian Muslims, Christians and Jews. Pierre Boucherle was its main instigator, along with [[Yahia Turki]], [[Abdelaziz Gorgi]], [[Moses Elias Levy|Moses Levy]], Ammar Farhat, and Jules Lellouche. Given its doctrine, some members have therefore turned to the sources of aesthetic Arab-Muslim art: such as miniature Islamic architecture, etc. Expressionist paintings by Amara Debbache, Jellal Ben Abdallah, and Ali Ben Salem are recognized while abstract art captures the imagination of painters like Edgar Naccache, Nello Levy, and [[Hedi Turki]].<ref name=\"tangka3\">{{cite web|url=http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040510/http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archivedate= 7 October 2011 |title=Un pays pour les peintres |publisher=Guide Tangka |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter independence in 1956, the art movement in Tunisia was propelled by the dynamics of nation building and by artists serving the state.
