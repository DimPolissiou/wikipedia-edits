The court was constituted by, and its first members were appointed under, the [[Judiciary Act 1903]]. It now operates under sections 71 to 75 of the constitution, the ''Judiciary Act'',<ref name=\"Judiciary Act\"/> and the ''High Court of Australia Act'' 1979.<ref name=\"High Court of Australia Act\" /> It is composed of seven justices: the [[Chief Justice of Australia]], currently [[Susan Kiefel]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AC}}, and six other justices. They are formally appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia]] on the advice of the federal government and under the constitution must retire at age 70.\n\nThe High Court has had a permanent home in [[Canberra]] since 1979. The majority of its sittings are held in the High Court building, which is situated in the [[Parliamentary Triangle]] overlooking [[Lake Burley Griffin]]. With increasing utilisation of video links, sittings are also often held in the state capitals.\n\n== Role ==\n\n[[File:Court 1 at the High Court of Australia.jpg|thumb|The No. 1 Courtroom, used for all cases that require a full bench of seven justices<ref>{{cite web|title=The building|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/about/the-building|website=High Court of Australia|accessdate=5 February 2018}}</ref>]]\n\nThe High Court exercises both original [[jurisdiction]] (cases that originate in the High Court) and appellate jurisdiction (appeals made to the High Court from other courts). The High Court is the court of final appeal with the ability to interpret the [[common law]] for the whole of Australia, not just the state or territory in which the matter arose. The High Court's broad jurisdiction is similar to that of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and unlike the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] which has a more limited jurisdiction. As such, the court is able to develop the common law consistently across all the states and territories. This role, alongside its role in constitutional interpretation, is one of the court's most significant. As [[Owen Dixon|Sir Owen Dixon]] said on his swearing in as Chief Justice of Australia:\n<blockquote>\n\"The High Court's jurisdiction is divided in its exercise between constitutional and federal cases which loom so largely in the public eye, and the great body of litigation between man and man, or even man and government, which has nothing to do with the Constitution, and which is the principal preoccupation of the court.\"<ref name=\"Dixon_cj_speech\">{{cite journal | author=Owen Dixon | authorlink=Owen Dixon | title=Address on being sworn in as Chief Justice | journal=[[Commonwealth Law Reports]] | year=1952 | volume=85 | pages=XIII}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThis broad array of jurisdiction enables the High Court to take a leading role in Australian law and contributes to consistency and uniformity among the laws of the different states.<ref name=\"Barwick_keystone_intro\">{{cite book | last=Bennett | first=J.M. | title=Keystone of the Federal Arch | year=1980 | publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | isbn=0-642-04866-5 | chapter=Foreword by Sir Garfield Barwick}}</ref>\n\n===Original jurisdiction===\nThe original jurisdiction of the High Court refers to matters that are originally heard in the High Court. The Australian Constitution confers actual (section 75) and potential (section 76) original jurisdiction.\n\nSection 75 of the constitution confers original jurisdiction in regard to \"all matters\":\n{{ordered list|type=i\n| arising under any treaty\n| affecting [[consulate general|consuls]] or other representatives of other countries\n| in which the Commonwealth, or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth, is a party\n| between States, or between residents of different States, or between a State and a resident of another State\n| in which a writ of [[mandamus]] or [[prohibition (writ)|prohibition]] or an [[injunction]] is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth.\n}}\n\nThe conferral of original jurisdiction creates some problems for the High Court. For example, challenges against immigration-related decisions are often brought against an officer of the Commonwealth within the original jurisdiction of the High Court.\n\nSection 76 provides that Parliament ''may'' confer original jurisdiction in relation to matters:\n{{ordered list|type=i\n| arising under the constitution or involving its interpretation\n| arising under any laws made by the Parliament\n| of [[admiralty law|admiralty]] and maritime jurisdiction\n| relating to the same subject matter claimed under the laws of different states.\n}}\n\nConstitutional matters, referred to in section 76(i), have been conferred to the High Court by section 30 of the ''[[Judiciary Act 1903]]''.<ref name=\"Judiciary Act\">{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ja1903112|Judiciary Act 1903}}.</ref> However, the inclusion of constitutional matters in section 76, rather than section 75, means that the High Court's original jurisdiction regarding constitutional matters could be removed. In practice, section 75(iii) (suing the Commonwealth) and section 75(iv) (conflicts between states) are broad enough that many constitutional matters would still be within jurisdiction. The original constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court is now well established: the [[Australian Law Reform Commission]] has described the inclusion of constitutional matters in section 76 rather than section 75 as \"an odd fact of history.\"<ref name=\"ALRC_92\">{{cite web | author=Australian Law Reform Commission | title=The Judicial Power of the Commonwealth | work=Australian Legal Information Institute | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/alrc/publications/reports/92/ch12.html#Heading7|accessdate=19 March 2006}}</ref> The [[Australian Constitutional Convention 1998|1998 Constitutional Convention]] recommended an amendment to the constitution to prevent the possibility of the jurisdiction being removed by Parliament. Failure to proceed on this issue suggests that it was considered highly unlikely that Parliament would ever take this step.\n\nThe requirement of \"a matter\" in section 75 and section 76 of the constitution means that a concrete issue must need to be resolved and the High Court cannot give an advisory opinion.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|20|1921|litigants=In Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1921/20.pdf (1921) 29 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 257], at 265}}.</ref>\n\n===Appellate jurisdiction===\n{{Australian court hierarchy}}\nThe High Court's appellate jurisdiction is defined under section 73 of the Constitution. The High Court can hear appeals from the supreme courts of the [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]], any federal court or court exercising federal jurisdiction (such as the [[Federal Court of Australia]], the [[Federal Circuit Court of Australia]], or other federal courts), and decisions made by one or more justices exercising the original jurisdiction of the court.\n\nHowever, section 73 allows the appellate jurisdiction to be limited \"with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes\". Parliament has prescribed a large limitation in section 35A of the ''Judiciary Act 1903''. This requires \"special leave\" to appeal. Special leave is granted only where a question of law is raised that is of public importance, or involves a conflict between courts; or \"is in the interests of the administration of justice\". Therefore, while the High Court is the final court of appeal, it cannot be considered a general court of appeal. The decision as to whether to grant special leave to appeal is determined by one or more Justices of the High Court (in practice, a panel of two or three judges). That is, the Court exercises the power to decide which appeal cases it will consider.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/court/courts/high-court-of-australia/ |title=High Court of Australia |work=Courts |publisher=[[Queensland Government]] |date=31 October 2013 |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Appeals to the Privy Council===\n[[File:High Court Australia-01JAC.jpg|thumb|upright|High Court building]]\n\nThe issue of appeals from the High Court to the United Kingdom's [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] was a significant one during the drafting of the Constitution and it continued to be significant in the years after the court's creation. The wording of section 74 of the constitution that was put to voters in the various colonies was that there was to be no appeal to the Privy Council in any matter involving the interpretation of the Constitution or of the Constitution of a State unless it involved the interests of some other dominion.<ref>See for example {{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/acts/1899-2.pdf |title='' Australasian Federation Enabling Act'' 1899 No 2 (NSW) |publisher=NSW Parliamentary Council's Office}}</ref>\n\nSection 74 of the Constitution, as enacted by the Imperial Parliament,<ref>{{cite web |title=''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act'' 1900 (Imp) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1900/12/pdfs/ukpga_19000012_en.pdf}}</ref> prohibited appeals on constitutional matters involving disputes about the limits ''[[inter se]]'' of Commonwealth or state powers, except where the High Court certified it was appropriate for the appeal to be determined by the Privy Council. It did so only once: in the 1912 case of ''[[Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth)]]'' when the Court was equally divided.<ref name=\"csr\">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|94|1912|litigants=[[Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth)]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/94.pdf (1912) 15 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 182]}}.</ref> After that case, in which the Privy Council refused to answer the constitutional questions put to it, the High Court never certified another ''inter se'' appeal.<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\">{{cite book | author=Hull, Crispin | title=The High Court of Australia: celebrating the centenary 1903\u20132003 | publisher=Lawbook Co. | year=2003|isbn=0-455-21947-8 |url=http://www.crispinhull.com.au/high-court-book/}}</ref> Indeed, in the case of ''[[Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2)|Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd]]'' (1985), the court said that it would never again grant a certificate of appeal.<ref name=\"kirmani no2\">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|27|1985|litigants=[[Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2)]] |parallelcite=(1985) 159 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 461}}.</ref>\n\nIn general matters, however, section 74 did not prevent the Privy Council from granting leave to appeal against the High Court's wishes and the Council did so often. In some cases the Council acknowledged that the Australian common law had developed differently from English law and thus did not apply its own principles (for example, in ''Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren'' (1967),<ref name=\"uren\">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|21|1967|litigants=Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren |parallelcite=(1967) 117 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 221}}.</ref> or in ''Viro v The Queen'' (1978)),<ref name=\"viro\">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|9|1978|litigants=Viro v The Queen |parallelcite=(1978) 141 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 88}}.</ref> by using a [[legal fiction]] that stated that different common law can apply to different circumstances.<ref name=\"Gleeson_s74\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/gleesoncj/cj_18jun08.pdf |title=The Birth, Life and Death of Section 74 |author=Gleeson, M |author-link=Murray Gleeson |date=2002}}</ref> However, in other cases, the Privy Council enforced English decisions, over-ruling decisions by the High Court. In ''Parker v The Queen''<ref name=\"parker\">{{Cite AustLII |litigants=Parker v The Queen |year=1963 |court=HCA |num=14 |parallecite=(1963) 111 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 610}}.</ref> (1963), Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon led a unanimous judgment that rejected a precedent of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''DPP v Smith'' saying, \"I shall not depart from the law on this matter as we have long since laid it down in this Court and I think that Smith's case should not be used in Australia as authority at all\".<ref name=\"parker\" /> The following year the Privy Council upheld an appeal, applying the House of Lords precedent.<ref name=\"parker appeal\">{{cite BAILII |litigants=Parker v The Queen |year=1964 |court=UKPC |num=16 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1964] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 1369}}; {{Cite AustLII|UKPCHCA|1|1964|parallelcite=(1964) 111 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 665 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |date=23 March 1964}}.</ref>\n\nSection 74 did provide that the parliament could make laws to prevent appeals to the Privy Council and it did so, beginning in 1968, with the ''Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968'', which closed off all appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation.<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C06161 ''Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act'' 1968 (Cth)], which ended all appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation</ref> In 1975, the ''Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act 1975'' was passed, which had the effect of closing all routes of appeal from the High Court.<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A00255 ''Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act'' 1975 (Cth)], which prohibited almost all types of appeal from the High Court.</ref> Appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council are now only theoretically possible in ''[[inter se]]'' matters if the High Court grants a certificate of appeal under section 74 of the Constitution. As noted above, the High Court indicated in 1985 it would not grant such a certificate in the future.  In 1986, with the passing of the [[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act]] by both the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/2/enacted ''Australia Act'' 1986 (Imp)]</ref> and the Parliament of Australia (with the request and consent of the Australian States),<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A03181 ''Australia Act'' 1986 (Cth)]</ref> appeals to the Privy Council from state Supreme Courts were closed off, leaving the High Court as the only avenue of appeal.  In 2002, [[Chief Justice of Australia|Chief Justice]] [[Murray Gleeson]] said that the \"combined effect\" of the legislation and the announcement in ''Kirmani'' \"has been that s 74 has become a dead letter, and what remains of s 74 after the legislation limiting appeals to the Privy Council will have no further effect\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/gleesoncj/cj_griffith2.htm|last=Gleeson|first=Murray|title=The Birth, Life and Death of Section 74|website=Samuel Griffith Society|date=14 June 2002|accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThirteen High Court judges have heard cases as part of the Privy Council.

Before the establishment of the High Court, appeals from the colonial supreme courts could be made only to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which involved the great expense of travelling to London. For this reason some politicians in the colonies wanted a new court that could travel between the colonies hearing appeals.\n\nFollowing [[Henry George Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]'s 1846 proposal for federation of the Australian colonies, an 1849 report from the Privy Council of the United Kingdom suggested that a national court be created.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\">{{cite book | author=Williams, John | title=One hundred years of the High Court of Australia | publisher=King's College, London | year=2003|isbn=1-85507-124-X}}</ref> In 1856, the then [[Governor of South Australia]], [[Richard Graves MacDonnell]], suggested to the [[Government of South Australia]] that they and the other colonies should consider establishing a court of appeal that would hear appeals from the Supreme Courts in each colony, and in 1860 the [[Parliament of South Australia]] passed legislation encouraging MacDonnell to put forward the idea to his colleagues in the other colonies. However, only the [[Government of Victoria]] seriously considered this proposal.<ref name=\"Bennett_keystone\">{{cite book | last=Bennett | first=J.M. | authorlink=John Bennett (Australian lawyer) | title=Keystone of the Federal Arch | year=1980 | publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | isbn=0-642-04866-5}}</ref>\n\nAt an inter-colonial conference in 1870 in [[Melbourne]], the idea of an inter-colonial court was again raised and subsequently a [[Royal Commission]] was established in Victoria to investigate options for establishing a court of appeal and for unifying [[extradition]] laws between the colonies and other similar matters. A draft bill establishing a court was put forward by the Commission, but it completely excluded appeals to the Privy Council, which reacted critically and prevented any serious attempts to implement the bill in London (before [[federation of Australia|federation]], any laws affecting all the colonies would have to be passed by the [[British Imperial Parliament]] in London).<ref name=\"Bennett_keystone\"/>\n\nIn 1880 another inter-colonial conference was convened, which proposed the establishment of an Australasian Court of Appeal. This conference was more firmly focussed on having an Australian court. Another draft bill was produced, providing that judges from the colonial Supreme Courts would serve one-year terms on the new court, with one judge from each colony at a given time. New Zealand, which was at the time also considering joining the Australian colonies in federation, was also to be a participant in the new court.<ref name=\"Bennett_keystone\"/> However, the proposal retained appeals from colonial Supreme Courts to the Privy Council, which some of the colonies disputed, and the bill was eventually abandoned.\n\n===Constitutional conventions===\n\n[[File:Chief Justice Samuel Griffith.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]], first [[Chief Justice of Australia]]]]\n\nThe [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Conventions]] of the 1890s, which met to draft an Australian Constitution, also raised the idea of a federal Supreme Court. Initial proposals at a conference in [[Melbourne]] in February 1890 led to a convention in [[Sydney]] in March and April 1891, which produced a draft constitution. The draft included the creation of a Supreme Court of Australia, which would not only interpret the Constitution, like the United States Supreme Court, but also would be a court of appeal from the state Supreme Courts. The draft effectively removed appeals to the Privy Council, allowing them only if the [[British monarch]] gave leave to appeal and not allowing appeals at all in constitutional matters.\n\nThis draft was largely the work of [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]],<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\"/> then the [[Premier of Queensland]], later Chief Justice of Queensland and the first Chief Justice of Australia. Other significant contributors to the judicial clauses in the draft included Attorney-General of Tasmania [[Andrew Inglis Clark]], who had prepared his own constitution prior to the convention. Inglis Clark's most significant contribution was to give the court its own constitutional authority, ensuring the [[separation of powers]]; the original formulation from Griffith, [[Edmund Barton]] and [[Charles Kingston]] provided only that the parliament could establish a court.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\"/>\n\n[[File:Andrew inglis clark.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andrew Inglis Clark]], prominent contributor to the clauses about the High Court in the [[Constitution of Australia]].]]\n\nAt the later conventions, in [[Adelaide]] in 1897, in [[Sydney]] later the same year and in Melbourne in early 1898, there were changes to the earlier draft. In Adelaide, the name of the court was changed from Supreme Court of Australia to High Court of Australia. Many people also opposed the new court completely replacing the Privy Council: many large businesses, particularly those which were subsidiaries of British companies or regularly traded with the United Kingdom, preferred for business reasons to keep the colonies under the unified jurisdiction of the British courts, and petitioned the conventions to that effect.<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\"/> Other arguments posited against removing Privy Council appeals were that Australian judges were of a poorer quality than English ones, and that without the Council's oversight, the law in the colonies risked becoming different from English law.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\" /> Some politicians, such as [[George Dibbs|Sir George Dibbs]], supported the petitioners, but others, including [[Alfred Deakin]], supported the design of the court as it was.<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\" /> Inglis Clark took the view that the possibility of divergence was a good thing, for the law could adapt appropriately to Australian circumstances.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\" /> Despite the debate, the portions of the draft dealing with the court remained largely unchanged, as the delegates focused on different matters.\n\nAfter the draft had been approved by the electors of the colonies, it was taken to London in 1899, for the assent of the British Imperial Parliament. However the issue of Privy Council appeals remained a sticking point with a number of Australian and British politicians, including the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Joseph Chamberlain]], the Chief Justice of South Australia, [[Samuel Way|Sir Samuel Way]], and the Chief Justice of Queensland, [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]].<ref name=\"Gleeson_s74\" /> Indeed, in October 1899, Griffith made representations to Chamberlain soliciting suggestions from British ministers for alterations to the draft, and offering some alterations of his own.<ref name=\"Gleeson_s74\" /> Indeed, such was the effect of these and other representations that Chamberlain called for delegates from the colonies to come to London to assist with the approval process, with a view to their approving any alterations that the British government might see fit to make; delegates were sent, including Deakin, Barton and [[Charles Kingston]], although they were under instructions that they would never agree to changes.<ref name=\"Gleeson_s74\" />\n\nAfter intense lobbying both in Australia and in the United Kingdom, the Imperial Parliament finally approved the draft constitution, albeit with an altered section 74, which represented a compromise between the two sides: there would be a general right of appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council, except that the Parliament of Australia would be able to make laws restricting this avenue, and also that appeals in ''inter se'' matters (matters concerning the boundary between and limits of the powers of the Commonwealth and the powers of the states) were not as of right, but had to be certified by the High Court.<ref name=\"Gleeson_s74\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n===Formation of the court===\n\n[[File:Opening hca melb.jpg|thumb|The first [[Chief Justice of Australia]], [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]], is administered the judicial oath at the first sitting of the High Court, in the [[wikt:banco|Banco]] Court of the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], 6 October 1903.]]\nThe Constitution was passed by the Imperial Parliament, and came into effect on 1 January 1901. However, the High Court was not established immediately; it was necessary for the new Parliament of Australia to make laws about the structure and procedure of the court. Some of the [[Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 1901\u20131903|members of the First Parliament]], including [[John Quick (politician)|Sir John Quick]], then one of the leading legal experts in Australia, opposed legislation to set up the court. Even [[H. B. Higgins]], who was himself later appointed to the court, objected to setting it up, on the grounds that it would be impotent while Privy Council appeals remained, and that in any event there was not enough work for a federal court to make it viable.<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\"/>\n\nIn 1902, the then [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] Alfred Deakin introduced the ''Judiciary Bill 1902'' in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Although Deakin and Griffith had produced a draft bill as early as February 1901, it was continually delayed by opponents in the parliament, and the success of the bill is generally attributed to Deakin's passion and effort in pushing the bill through the parliament despite this opposition.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\" /> Deakin had proposed that the court be composed of five judges, specially selected to the court; opponents instead proposed that the court should be made up of state Supreme Court justices, taking turns to sit on the High Court on a rotation basis, as had been mooted at the Constitutional Conventions a decade before.<ref name=\"mchugh oxford companion\">{{cite speech |title=The High Court and the Oxford Companion to the High Court |last=McHugh |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael McHugh (judge) |event=Constitutional Law and Conference Dinner |location=Botanical Gardens Restaurant |date=15 February 2002 |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/mchughj/mchughj_oxford.htm |accessdate=25 February 2012 }}</ref> Deakin eventually negotiated amendments with the [[opposition (Australia)|opposition]], reducing the number of judges from five to three, and eliminating financial benefits such as pensions.\n\nAt one point, Deakin even threatened to resign as Attorney-General due to the difficulties he faced.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\"/> In what is now a famous speech, Deakin gave a [[Reading (legislature)|second reading]] to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], lasting three and a half hours, in which he declared:\n<blockquote>\"The federation is constituted by distribution of powers, and it is this court which decides the orbit and boundary of every power... It is properly termed the keystone of the federal arch... The statute stands and will stand on the statute-book just as in the hour in which it was assented to. But the nation lives, grows and expands. Its circumstances change, its needs alter, and its problems present themselves with new faces.

On 6 October, the court held its first sitting in the Banco Court in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]].\n\nOn 12 October 1906, the size of the High Court was increased to five Justices, and Deakin appointed [[H. B. Higgins]] and [[Isaac Isaacs]] to the High Court. In February 1913, the High Court was increased again, with the addition of two justices, bringing the total to seven. [[Charles Powers]] and [[Albert Bathurst Piddington]] were appointed.  The outcry against their appointments was so great, however, that Justice Piddington resigned on 5 April 1913 without having taken up his seat.<ref name=\"history of the high court\">{{cite web|title=History of the High Court |publisher=High Court of Australia |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/about/history-of-the-high-court| accessdate=15 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===First years of the court===\n[[File:HCA Melbourne LtBourke.jpg|thumb|The court's home between 1928 and 1980, the purpose-built courtroom in [[Little Bourke Street, Melbourne]].]]\nAfter the court's first sitting in the Banco Court in [[Melbourne]], the court continued to use that court until 1928, when a dedicated courtroom was built in [[Little Bourke Street, Melbourne|Little Bourke Street]], next to the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], which provided the court's Melbourne sitting place and housed the court's principal [[wikt:registry|registry]] until 1980.<ref name=\"prov old building\">{{cite web|title=High Court Building |work=Our Nation's First Capital |publisher=Public Records Office Victoria |url=http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/exhibs/ournation/f_hcb.htm |accessdate=4 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819072852/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/exhibs/ournation/f_hcb.htm |archivedate=19 August 2008  }}</ref> The court also sat regularly in Sydney, where it originally shared space in the Criminal Courts in the suburb of [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]], before a dedicated courtroom was constructed next door in 1923.<ref name=\"centenary press release\">{{cite web |title=Ch 3.

Deakin had envisaged that the court would sit in many different locations, so as to truly be a federal court. Shortly after the court's creation, Chief Justice Griffith established a schedule for sittings in state capitals: [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]] in February, [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] in June, [[Perth, Western Australia]] in September and Adelaide, [[South Australia]] in October; it is said that Griffith established this schedule because those were the times of year he found the weather most pleasant in each city. The tradition remains to this day, although most of the court's sittings are now conducted in Canberra.\n\nSittings were dependent on the caseload and to this day sittings in Hobart occur only once every few years. There are annual sittings in Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane for up to a week each. During the [[Great Depression]], sittings outside of Melbourne and Sydney were suspended to reduce costs.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the court faced a period of change. The Chief Justice, [[John Latham (Australian jurist)|Sir John Latham]], served from 1940 to 1941 as Australia's first ambassador to Japan, although his activities in this role were limited by the mutual assistance pact that Japan had entered into with the [[Axis powers]] before he could arrive in Tokyo, and were curtailed by the commencement of the [[Pacific War]].<ref name=\"adb latham\">{{cite AuDB |id2=latham-sir-john-greig-7104 |title=Latham, Sir John Greig (1877\u20131964) |first=Stuart |last=Macintyre |volume=10 |pages=2\u20136 |year=1986 |isbn = 0-522-84327-1}}</ref> Justice Sir Owen Dixon was also absent for several years, while he served as Australia's minister to the United States in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].<ref name=\"adb Dixon\">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |first1=Grant |last1=Anderson |first2=Daryl |last2=Dawson |author-link2=Daryl Dawson |title=Dixon, Sir Owen (1886\u20131972) |id2=dixon-sir-owen-10024 |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> [[George Rich|Sir George Rich]] was Acting Chief Justice in Latham's absence.

In 1976 the [[Federal Court of Australia]] was established, with a general federal jurisdiction, and in more recent years the [[Family Court of Australia|Family Court]] and [[Federal Magistrates Court]] have been set up to reduce the court's workload in specific areas.\n\nIn 1968, appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation were barred by the ''Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968''. In 1975, the ''Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act 1975'' closed all routes of appeal from the High Court. In 1986, with the passing of the ''[[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act]]'' by both the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] and the Parliament of Australia (with the request and consent of the Australian States), direct appeals to the Privy Council from state Supreme Courts were also closed off, leaving the High Court as the only avenue of appeal.\n\nThe life tenure of High Court Justices was ended in 1977. A national referendum in May 1977 approved the ''[[Australian referendum, 1977 (Retirement of Judges)|Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) Act]]'' (Cth), which upon its commencement on 29 July 1977 amended section 72 of the Constitution so as require that all Justices appointed from then on must retire on attaining the age of 70 years.<ref name=HChistory>[http://www.hcourt.gov.au/about/history High Court of Australia \u2013 History of the High Court]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004A01721|title= Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) Act 1977|website= ComLaw|accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe ''High Court of Australia Act 1979'' (Cth), which commenced on 21 April 1980, gave the High Court power to administer its own affairs and prescribed the qualifications for, and method of appointment of, its Justices.<ref name=HChistory /><ref name=\"High Court of Australia Act\">{{citation |url= http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00184 |title= High Court of Australia Act 1979}} (Cth).</ref>\n\n==Jurisprudence==\n\nThe legal history of the court is commonly summarised by reference to the Chief Justice of the time.

After O'Connor's death in 1912, an amendment to the ''Judiciary Act 1903'' expanded the bench to seven. For most of 1930 two seats were left vacant due to monetary constraints placed on the court by the Depression. The economic downturn had also led to a reduction in litigation and consequently less work for the court. After Sir Isaac Isaacs retired in 1931, his seat was left empty, and in 1933 an amendment to the ''Judiciary Act'' officially reduced the number of seats to six. However, this led to some decisions being split three-all.

review]] over laws passed by the [[Parliament of Australia]] and the parliaments of the states and territories, and the ability to interpret the [[Constitution of Australia]] and thereby shape the development of [[federalism in Australia]].\n\nThe High Court is mandated by section 71 of the [[Australian Constitution]], which vests in it the [[judiciary|judicial power]] of the Commonwealth of Australia. The court was constituted by, and its first members were appointed under, the [[Judiciary Act 1903]]. It now operates under sections 71 to 75 of the constitution, the ''Judiciary Act'',<ref name=\"Judiciary Act\"/> and the ''High Court of Australia Act'' 1979.<ref name=\"High Court of Australia Act\" /> It is composed of seven justices: the [[Chief Justice of Australia]], currently [[Susan Kiefel]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AC}}, and six other justices. They are formally appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia]] on the advice of the federal government and under the constitution must retire at age 70.\n\nThe High Court has had a permanent home in [[Canberra]] since 1979. The majority of its sittings are held in the High Court building, which is situated in the [[Parliamentary Triangle]] overlooking [[Lake Burley Griffin]]. With increasing utilisation of video links, sittings are also often held in the state capitals.\n\n== Role ==\n\n[[File:Court 1 at the High Court of Australia.jpg|thumb|The No. 1 Courtroom, used for all cases that require a full bench of seven justices<ref>{{cite web|title=The building|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/about/the-building|website=High Court of Australia|accessdate=5 February 2018}}</ref>]]\n\nThe High Court exercises both original [[jurisdiction]] (cases that originate in the High Court) and appellate jurisdiction (appeals made to the High Court from other courts). The High Court is the court of final appeal with the ability to interpret the [[common law]] for the whole of Australia, not just the state or territory in which the matter arose. The High Court's broad jurisdiction is similar to that of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and unlike the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] which has a more limited jurisdiction. As such, the court is able to develop the common law consistently across all the states and territories. This role, alongside its role in constitutional interpretation, is one of the court's most significant. As [[Owen Dixon|Sir Owen Dixon]] said on his swearing in as Chief Justice of Australia:\n<blockquote>\n\"The High Court's jurisdiction is divided in its exercise between constitutional and federal cases which loom so largely in the public eye, and the great body of litigation between man and man, or even man and government, which has nothing to do with the Constitution, and which is the principal preoccupation of the court.\"<ref name=\"Dixon_cj_speech\">{{cite journal | author=Owen Dixon | authorlink=Owen Dixon | title=Address on being sworn in as Chief Justice | journal=[[Commonwealth Law Reports]] | year=1952 | volume=85 | pages=XIII}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThis broad array of jurisdiction enables the High Court to take a leading role in Australian law and contributes to consistency and uniformity among the laws of the different states.<ref name=\"Barwick_keystone_intro\">{{cite book | last=Bennett | first=J.M. | title=Keystone of the Federal Arch | year=1980 | publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | isbn=0-642-04866-5 | chapter=Foreword by Sir Garfield Barwick}}</ref>\n\n===Original jurisdiction===\nThe original jurisdiction of the High Court refers to matters that are originally heard in the High Court. The Australian Constitution confers actual (section 75) and potential (section 76) original jurisdiction.\n\nSection 75 of the constitution confers original jurisdiction in regard to \"all matters\":\n{{ordered list|type=i\n| arising under any treaty\n| affecting [[consulate general|consuls]] or other representatives of other countries\n| in which the Commonwealth, or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth, is a party\n| between States, or between residents of different States, or between a State and a resident of another State\n| in which a writ of [[mandamus]] or [[prohibition (writ)|prohibition]] or an [[injunction]] is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth.\n}}\n\nThe conferral of original jurisdiction creates some problems for the High Court. For example, challenges against immigration-related decisions are often brought against an officer of the Commonwealth within the original jurisdiction of the High Court.\n\nSection 76 provides that Parliament ''may'' confer original jurisdiction in relation to matters:\n{{ordered list|type=i\n| arising under the constitution or involving its interpretation\n| arising under any laws made by the Parliament\n| of [[admiralty law|admiralty]] and maritime jurisdiction\n| relating to the same subject matter claimed under the laws of different states.\n}}\n\nConstitutional matters, referred to in section 76(i), have been conferred to the High Court by section 30 of the ''[[Judiciary Act 1903]]''.<ref name=\"Judiciary Act\">{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ja1903112|Judiciary Act 1903}}.</ref> However, the inclusion of constitutional matters in section 76, rather than section 75, means that the High Court's original jurisdiction regarding constitutional matters could be removed. In practice, section 75(iii) (suing the Commonwealth) and section 75(iv) (conflicts between states) are broad enough that many constitutional matters would still be within jurisdiction. The original constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court is now well established: the [[Australian Law Reform Commission]] has described the inclusion of constitutional matters in section 76 rather than section 75 as \"an odd fact of history.\"<ref name=\"ALRC_92\">{{cite web | author=Australian Law Reform Commission | title=The Judicial Power of the Commonwealth | work=Australian Legal Information Institute | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/alrc/publications/reports/92/ch12.html#Heading7|accessdate=19 March 2006}}</ref> The [[Australian Constitutional Convention 1998|1998 Constitutional Convention]] recommended an amendment to the constitution to prevent the possibility of the jurisdiction being removed by Parliament. Failure to proceed on this issue suggests that it was considered highly unlikely that Parliament would ever take this step.\n\nThe requirement of \"a matter\" in section 75 and section 76 of the constitution means that a concrete issue must need to be resolved and the High Court cannot give an advisory opinion.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|20|1921|litigants=In Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1921/20.pdf (1921) 29 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 257], at 265}}.</ref>\n\n===Appellate jurisdiction===\n{{Australian court hierarchy}}\nThe High Court's appellate jurisdiction is defined under section 73 of the Constitution. The High Court can hear appeals from the supreme courts of the [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]], any federal court or court exercising federal jurisdiction (such as the [[Federal Court of Australia]], the [[Federal Circuit Court of Australia]], or other federal courts), and decisions made by one or more justices exercising the original jurisdiction of the court.\n\nHowever, section 73 allows the appellate jurisdiction to be limited \"with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes\". Parliament has prescribed a large limitation in section 35A of the ''Judiciary Act 1903''. This requires \"special leave\" to appeal. Special leave is granted only where a question of law is raised that is of public importance, or involves a conflict between courts; or \"is in the interests of the administration of justice\". Therefore, while the High Court is the final court of appeal, it cannot be considered a general court of appeal. The decision as to whether to grant special leave to appeal is determined by one or more Justices of the High Court (in practice, a panel of two or three judges). That is, the Court exercises the power to decide which appeal cases it will consider.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/court/courts/high-court-of-australia/ |title=High Court of Australia |work=Courts |publisher=[[Queensland Government]] |date=31 October 2013 |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Appeals to the Privy Council===\n[[File:High Court Australia-01JAC.jpg|thumb|upright|High Court building]]\n\nThe issue of appeals from the High Court to the United Kingdom's [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] was a significant one during the drafting of the Constitution and it continued to be significant in the years after the court's creation. The wording of section 74 of the constitution that was put to voters in the various colonies was that there was to be no appeal to the Privy Council in any matter involving the interpretation of the Constitution or of the Constitution of a State unless it involved the interests of some other dominion.<ref>See for example {{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/acts/1899-2.pdf |title='' Australasian Federation Enabling Act'' 1899 No 2 (NSW) |publisher=NSW Parliamentary Council's Office}}</ref>\n\nSection 74 of the Constitution, as enacted by the Imperial Parliament,<ref>{{cite web |title=''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act'' 1900 (Imp) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1900/12/pdfs/ukpga_19000012_en.pdf}}</ref> prohibited appeals on constitutional matters involving disputes about the limits ''[[inter se]]'' of Commonwealth or state powers, except where the High Court certified it was appropriate for the appeal to be determined by the Privy Council. It did so only once: in the 1912 case of ''[[Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth)]]'' when the Court was equally divided.<ref name=\"csr\">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|94|1912|litigants=[[Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth)]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/94.pdf (1912) 15 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 182]}}.</ref> After that case, in which the Privy Council refused to answer the constitutional questions put to it, the High Court never certified another ''inter se'' appeal.<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\">{{cite book | author=Hull, Crispin | title=The High Court of Australia: celebrating the centenary 1903\u20132003 | publisher=Lawbook Co. | year=2003|isbn=0-455-21947-8 |url=http://www.crispinhull.com.au/high-court-book/}}</ref> Indeed, in the case of ''[[Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2)|Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd]]'' (1985), the court said that it would never again grant a certificate of appeal.<ref name=\"kirmani no2\">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|27|1985|litigants=[[Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2)]] |parallelcite=(1985) 159 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 461}}.</ref>\n\nIn general matters, however, section 74 did not prevent the Privy Council from granting leave to appeal against the High Court's wishes and the Council did so often. In some cases the Council acknowledged that the Australian common law had developed differently from English law and thus did not apply its own principles (for example, in ''Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren'' (1967),<ref name=\"uren\">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|21|1967|litigants=Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren |parallelcite=(1967) 117 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 221}}.</ref> or in ''Viro v The Queen'' (1978)),<ref name=\"viro\">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|9|1978|litigants=Viro v The Queen |parallelcite=(1978) 141 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 88}}.</ref> by using a [[legal fiction]] that stated that different common law can apply to different circumstances.<ref name=\"Gleeson_s74\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/gleesoncj/cj_18jun08.pdf |title=The Birth, Life and Death of Section 74 |author=Gleeson, M |author-link=Murray Gleeson |date=2002}}</ref> However, in other cases, the Privy Council enforced English decisions, over-ruling decisions by the High Court. In ''Parker v The Queen''<ref name=\"parker\">{{Cite AustLII |litigants=Parker v The Queen |year=1963 |court=HCA |num=14 |parallecite=(1963) 111 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 610}}.</ref> (1963), Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon led a unanimous judgment that rejected a precedent of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''DPP v Smith'' saying, \"I shall not depart from the law on this matter as we have long since laid it down in this Court and I think that Smith's case should not be used in Australia as authority at all\".<ref name=\"parker\" /> The following year the Privy Council upheld an appeal, applying the House of Lords precedent.<ref name=\"parker appeal\">{{cite BAILII |litigants=Parker v The Queen |year=1964 |court=UKPC |num=16 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1964] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 1369}}; {{Cite AustLII|UKPCHCA|1|1964|parallelcite=(1964) 111 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 665 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |date=23 March 1964}}.</ref>\n\nSection 74 did provide that the parliament could make laws to prevent appeals to the Privy Council and it did so, beginning in 1968, with the ''Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968'', which closed off all appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation.<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C06161 ''Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act'' 1968 (Cth)], which ended all appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation</ref> In 1975, the ''Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act 1975'' was passed, which had the effect of closing all routes of appeal from the High Court.<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A00255 ''Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act'' 1975 (Cth)], which prohibited almost all types of appeal from the High Court.</ref> Appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council are now only theoretically possible in ''[[inter se]]'' matters if the High Court grants a certificate of appeal under section 74 of the Constitution. As noted above, the High Court indicated in 1985 it would not grant such a certificate in the future.  In 1986, with the passing of the [[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act]] by both the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/2/enacted ''Australia Act'' 1986 (Imp)]</ref> and the Parliament of Australia (with the request and consent of the Australian States),<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A03181 ''Australia Act'' 1986 (Cth)]</ref> appeals to the Privy Council from state Supreme Courts were closed off, leaving the High Court as the only avenue of appeal.

Before the establishment of the High Court, appeals from the colonial supreme courts could be made only to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which involved the great expense of travelling to London. For this reason some politicians in the colonies wanted a new court that could travel between the colonies hearing appeals.\n\nFollowing [[Henry George Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]'s 1846 proposal for federation of the Australian colonies, an 1849 report from the Privy Council of the United Kingdom suggested that a national court be created.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\">{{cite book | author=Williams, John | title=One hundred years of the High Court of Australia | publisher=King's College, London | year=2003|isbn=1-85507-124-X}}</ref> In 1856, the then [[Governor of South Australia]], [[Richard Graves MacDonnell]], suggested to the [[Government of South Australia]] that they and the other colonies should consider establishing a court of appeal that would hear appeals from the Supreme Courts in each colony, and in 1860 the [[Parliament of South Australia]] passed legislation encouraging MacDonnell to put forward the idea to his colleagues in the other colonies. However, only the [[Government of Victoria]] seriously considered this proposal.<ref name=\"Bennett_keystone\">{{cite book | last=Bennett | first=J.M. | authorlink=John Bennett (Australian lawyer) | title=Keystone of the Federal Arch | year=1980 | publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | isbn=0-642-04866-5}}</ref>\n\nAt an inter-colonial conference in 1870 in [[Melbourne]], the idea of an inter-colonial court was again raised and subsequently a [[Royal Commission]] was established in Victoria to investigate options for establishing a court of appeal and for unifying [[extradition]] laws between the colonies and other similar matters. A draft bill establishing a court was put forward by the Commission, but it completely excluded appeals to the Privy Council, which reacted critically and prevented any serious attempts to implement the bill in London (before [[federation of Australia|federation]], any laws affecting all the colonies would have to be passed by the [[British Imperial Parliament]] in London).<ref name=\"Bennett_keystone\"/>\n\nIn 1880 another inter-colonial conference was convened, which proposed the establishment of an Australasian Court of Appeal. This conference was more firmly focussed on having an Australian court. Another draft bill was produced, providing that judges from the colonial Supreme Courts would serve one-year terms on the new court, with one judge from each colony at a given time. New Zealand, which was at the time also considering joining the Australian colonies in federation, was also to be a participant in the new court.<ref name=\"Bennett_keystone\"/> However, the proposal retained appeals from colonial Supreme Courts to the Privy Council, which some of the colonies disputed, and the bill was eventually abandoned.\n\n===Constitutional conventions===\n\n[[File:Chief Justice Samuel Griffith.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]], first [[Chief Justice of Australia]]]]\n\nThe [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Conventions]] of the 1890s, which met to draft an Australian Constitution, also raised the idea of a federal Supreme Court. Initial proposals at a conference in [[Melbourne]] in February 1890 led to a convention in [[Sydney]] in March and April 1891, which produced a draft constitution. The draft included the creation of a Supreme Court of Australia, which would not only interpret the Constitution, like the United States Supreme Court, but also would be a court of appeal from the state Supreme Courts. The draft effectively removed appeals to the Privy Council, allowing them only if the [[British monarch]] gave leave to appeal and not allowing appeals at all in constitutional matters.\n\nThis draft was largely the work of [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]],<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\"/> then the [[Premier of Queensland]], later Chief Justice of Queensland and the first Chief Justice of Australia. Other significant contributors to the judicial clauses in the draft included Attorney-General of Tasmania [[Andrew Inglis Clark]], who had prepared his own constitution prior to the convention. Inglis Clark's most significant contribution was to give the court its own constitutional authority, ensuring the [[separation of powers]]; the original formulation from Griffith, [[Edmund Barton]] and [[Charles Kingston]] provided only that the parliament could establish a court.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\"/>\n\n[[File:Andrew inglis clark.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andrew Inglis Clark]], prominent contributor to the clauses about the High Court in the [[Constitution of Australia]].]]\n\nAt the later conventions, in [[Adelaide]] in 1897, in [[Sydney]] later the same year and in Melbourne in early 1898, there were changes to the earlier draft. In Adelaide, the name of the court was changed from Supreme Court of Australia to High Court of Australia. Many people also opposed the new court completely replacing the Privy Council: many large businesses, particularly those which were subsidiaries of British companies or regularly traded with the United Kingdom, preferred for business reasons to keep the colonies under the unified jurisdiction of the British courts, and petitioned the conventions to that effect.<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\"/> Other arguments posited against removing Privy Council appeals were that Australian judges were of a poorer quality than English ones, and that without the Council's oversight, the law in the colonies risked becoming different from English law.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\" /> Some politicians, such as [[George Dibbs|Sir George Dibbs]], supported the petitioners, but others, including [[Alfred Deakin]], supported the design of the court as it was.<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\" /> Inglis Clark took the view that the possibility of divergence was a good thing, for the law could adapt appropriately to Australian circumstances.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\" /> Despite the debate, the portions of the draft dealing with the court remained largely unchanged, as the delegates focused on different matters.\n\nAfter the draft had been approved by the electors of the colonies, it was taken to London in 1899, for the assent of the British Imperial Parliament. However the issue of Privy Council appeals remained a sticking point with a number of Australian and British politicians, including the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Joseph Chamberlain]], the Chief Justice of South Australia, [[Samuel Way|Sir Samuel Way]], and the Chief Justice of Queensland, [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]].<ref name=\"Gleeson_s74\" /> Indeed, in October 1899, Griffith made representations to Chamberlain soliciting suggestions from British ministers for alterations to the draft, and offering some alterations of his own.<ref name=\"Gleeson_s74\" /> Indeed, such was the effect of these and other representations that Chamberlain called for delegates from the colonies to come to London to assist with the approval process, with a view to their approving any alterations that the British government might see fit to make; delegates were sent, including Deakin, Barton and [[Charles Kingston]], although they were under instructions that they would never agree to changes.<ref name=\"Gleeson_s74\" />\n\nAfter intense lobbying both in Australia and in the United Kingdom, the Imperial Parliament finally approved the draft constitution, albeit with an altered section 74, which represented a compromise between the two sides: there would be a general right of appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council, except that the Parliament of Australia would be able to make laws restricting this avenue, and also that appeals in ''inter se'' matters (matters concerning the boundary between and limits of the powers of the Commonwealth and the powers of the states) were not as of right, but had to be certified by the High Court.<ref name=\"Gleeson_s74\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n===Formation of the court===\n\n[[File:Opening hca melb.jpg|thumb|The first [[Chief Justice of Australia]], [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]], is administered the judicial oath at the first sitting of the High Court, in the [[wikt:banco|Banco]] Court of the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], 6 October 1903.]]\nThe Constitution was passed by the Imperial Parliament, and came into effect on 1 January 1901. However, the High Court was not established immediately; it was necessary for the new Parliament of Australia to make laws about the structure and procedure of the court. Some of the [[Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 1901\u20131903|members of the First Parliament]], including [[John Quick (politician)|Sir John Quick]], then one of the leading legal experts in Australia, opposed legislation to set up the court. Even [[H. B. Higgins]], who was himself later appointed to the court, objected to setting it up, on the grounds that it would be impotent while Privy Council appeals remained, and that in any event there was not enough work for a federal court to make it viable.<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\"/>\n\nIn 1902, the then [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] Alfred Deakin introduced the ''Judiciary Bill 1902'' in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Although Deakin and Griffith had produced a draft bill as early as February 1901, it was continually delayed by opponents in the parliament, and the success of the bill is generally attributed to Deakin's passion and effort in pushing the bill through the parliament despite this opposition.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\" /> Deakin had proposed that the court be composed of five judges, specially selected to the court; opponents instead proposed that the court should be made up of state Supreme Court justices, taking turns to sit on the High Court on a rotation basis, as had been mooted at the Constitutional Conventions a decade before.<ref name=\"mchugh oxford companion\">{{cite speech |title=The High Court and the Oxford Companion to the High Court |last=McHugh |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael McHugh (judge) |event=Constitutional Law and Conference Dinner |location=Botanical Gardens Restaurant |date=15 February 2002 |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/mchughj/mchughj_oxford.htm |accessdate=25 February 2012 }}</ref> Deakin eventually negotiated amendments with the [[opposition (Australia)|opposition]], reducing the number of judges from five to three, and eliminating financial benefits such as pensions.\n\nAt one point, Deakin even threatened to resign as Attorney-General due to the difficulties he faced.<ref name=\"Williams_hundred\"/> In what is now a famous speech, Deakin gave a [[Reading (legislature)|second reading]] to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], lasting three and a half hours, in which he declared:\n<blockquote>\"The federation is constituted by distribution of powers, and it is this court which decides the orbit and boundary of every power... It is properly termed the keystone of the federal arch... The statute stands and will stand on the statute-book just as in the hour in which it was assented to. But the nation lives, grows and expands. Its circumstances change, its needs alter, and its problems present themselves with new faces.

On 6 October, the court held its first sitting in the Banco Court in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]].\n\nOn 12 October 1906, the size of the High Court was increased to five Justices, and Deakin appointed [[H. B. Higgins]] and [[Isaac Isaacs]] to the High Court. In February 1913, the High Court was increased again, with the addition of two justices, bringing the total to seven. [[Charles Powers]] and [[Albert Bathurst Piddington]] were appointed.  The outcry against their appointments was so great, however, that Justice Piddington resigned on 5 April 1913 without having taken up his seat.<ref name=\"history of the high court\">{{cite web|title=History of the High Court |publisher=High Court of Australia |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/about/history-of-the-high-court| accessdate=15 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===First years of the court===\n[[File:HCA Melbourne LtBourke.jpg|thumb|The court's home between 1928 and 1980, the purpose-built courtroom in [[Little Bourke Street, Melbourne]].]]\nAfter the court's first sitting in the Banco Court in [[Melbourne]], the court continued to use that court until 1928, when a dedicated courtroom was built in [[Little Bourke Street, Melbourne|Little Bourke Street]], next to the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], which provided the court's Melbourne sitting place and housed the court's principal [[wikt:registry|registry]] until 1980.<ref name=\"prov old building\">{{cite web|title=High Court Building |work=Our Nation's First Capital |publisher=Public Records Office Victoria |url=http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/exhibs/ournation/f_hcb.htm |accessdate=4 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819072852/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/exhibs/ournation/f_hcb.htm |archivedate=19 August 2008  }}</ref> The court also sat regularly in Sydney, where it originally shared space in the Criminal Courts in the suburb of [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]], before a dedicated courtroom was constructed next door in 1923.<ref name=\"centenary press release\">{{cite web |title=Ch 3.

Deakin had envisaged that the court would sit in many different locations, so as to truly be a federal court. Shortly after the court's creation, Chief Justice Griffith established a schedule for sittings in state capitals: [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]] in February, [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] in June, [[Perth, Western Australia]] in September and Adelaide, [[South Australia]] in October; it is said that Griffith established this schedule because those were the times of year he found the weather most pleasant in each city. The tradition remains to this day, although most of the court's sittings are now conducted in Canberra.\n\nSittings were dependent on the caseload and to this day sittings in Hobart occur only once every few years. There are annual sittings in Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane for up to a week each. During the [[Great Depression]], sittings outside of Melbourne and Sydney were suspended to reduce costs.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the court faced a period of change. The Chief Justice, [[John Latham (Australian jurist)|Sir John Latham]], served from 1940 to 1941 as Australia's first ambassador to Japan, although his activities in this role were limited by the mutual assistance pact that Japan had entered into with the [[Axis powers]] before he could arrive in Tokyo, and were curtailed by the commencement of the [[Pacific War]].<ref name=\"adb latham\">{{cite AuDB |id2=latham-sir-john-greig-7104 |title=Latham, Sir John Greig (1877\u20131964) |first=Stuart |last=Macintyre |volume=10 |pages=2\u20136 |year=1986 |isbn = 0-522-84327-1}}</ref> Justice Sir Owen Dixon was also absent for several years, while he served as Australia's minister to the United States in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].<ref name=\"adb Dixon\">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |first1=Grant |last1=Anderson |first2=Daryl |last2=Dawson |author-link2=Daryl Dawson |title=Dixon, Sir Owen (1886\u20131972) |id2=dixon-sir-owen-10024 |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> [[George Rich|Sir George Rich]] was Acting Chief Justice in Latham's absence.

In 1976 the [[Federal Court of Australia]] was established, with a general federal jurisdiction, and in more recent years the [[Family Court of Australia|Family Court]] and [[Federal Magistrates Court]] have been set up to reduce the court's workload in specific areas.\n\nIn 1968, appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation were barred by the ''Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968''. In 1975, the ''Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act 1975'' closed all routes of appeal from the High Court. In 1986, with the passing of the ''[[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act]]'' by both the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] and the Parliament of Australia (with the request and consent of the Australian States), direct appeals to the Privy Council from state Supreme Courts were also closed off, leaving the High Court as the only avenue of appeal.\n\nThe life tenure of High Court Justices was ended in 1977.

For most of 1930 two seats were left vacant due to monetary constraints placed on the court by the Depression. The economic downturn had also led to a reduction in litigation and consequently less work for the court. After Sir Isaac Isaacs retired in 1931, his seat was left empty, and in 1933 an amendment to the ''Judiciary Act'' officially reduced the number of seats to six. However, this led to some decisions being split three-all.

At present, all members of the High Court engage two associates for one-year terms.  In addition, the Chief Justice is assisted by an employee of the library as a legal research officer.  The role of the associate is broadly equivalent to that of a [[law clerk]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].  Depending on the judge, an associate's responsibilities will typically include legal research, assistance in preparation for oral arguments, [[Tipstaff|tipping]] in court during oral argument, editing judgments and assisting with extrajudicial functions, such as speechwriting.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Katherine|title=Open Chambers: High Court Associates and Supreme Court Clerks Compared |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbULawRw/2007/26.html}} (2007) 31(2) Melbourne University Law Review 646.</ref> Associates generally will have graduated with first class honours, at or near the top of their class, from a leading law school.<ref name=associate>{{cite web|title=Applying for an associateship with a Justice of the High Court of Australia|publisher=High Court of Australia|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/employment/applying-for-an-associateship-with-a-justice-of-the-high-court-of-australia |accessdate= |date=}}</ref> Associates will typically also have research experience (and often experience working for a law firm or university or another court).<ref name=associate/> Accordingly, competition for associate positions is very high with hundreds of applications being received annually.<ref name=associate/>\n\nSir [[Keith Aickin]], Justice [[Stephen Gageler]] and Justice [[James Edelman]] all served as associates at the High Court of Australia to [[Sir Owen Dixon]], [[Sir Anthony Mason]] and Justice [[John Toohey (judge)|Toohey]], respectively.<ref>{{cite news|title=The boy from Sandy Hollow|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-boy-from-sandy-hollow/2009/01/09/1231004286973.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|accessdate=3 May 2016|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=10 January 2009|author=Feneley, Rick}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Building===\n[[File:High Court of Australia - panoramio.jpg|thumb|High Court building, viewed across [[Lake Burley Griffin]]]]\n\nIn the 1950s, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] established a plan to develop Canberra and construct other important national buildings. A 1959 plan featured a new building for the High Court on the shore of [[Lake Burley Griffin]], next to the location for the [[Parliament House, Canberra|new Parliament House]] and the [[National Library of Australia]]. This plan was abandoned in 1968 and the location of the Parliament was moved, later settling on the present site on Capital Hill.<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\"/>{{rp|ch 4}}\n\nIn March 1968, the government announced that the court would move to Canberra.<ref name=\"Hull_centenary\"/>{{rp|ch 4}} In 1972 an international competition was held attracting 158 entries. In 1973 the firm of [[Edwards Madigan Torzillo Briggs]] was declared the winner of the two-stage competition. Architect [[Chris Kringas]] was the Principal Designer and Director in charge working with [[Feiko Bouman]]. In March 1975, only one month before construction began, Kringas died, aged 38.

The site is just to the east of the axis running between Capital Hill and the [[Australian War Memorial]]. The High Court building houses three courtrooms, Justices' chambers, and the Court's main registry, library, and corporate services facilities. It is an unusual and distinctive structure, built in the [[brutalism|brutalist]] style, and features an immense public atrium with a 24-metre-high roof. The neighbouring National Gallery was also designed by the firm of Edwards Madigan Torzillo and Briggs. There are similarities between the two buildings in material and style but significant differences in architectural form and spatial concept. The building was completed in 1980 and the majority of the court's sittings have been held in Canberra since then.\n\nThe High Court and the National Gallery Precinct were added to the [[Australian National Heritage List]] in November 2007.<ref>[http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/high-court-national-art-gallery/index.html Australian National Heritage listing for the High Court-National Gallery Precinct]</ref>\n\n===Online===\nThe High Court makes itself generally available to the public through its own website.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au |title=Home page|publisher=High Court of Australia |accessdate=21 February 2014 }}</ref> Judgment Alerts, available on the Court's website and by email with free subscription, provide subscribers with notice of upcoming judgments (normally a week beforehand) and, almost immediately after the delivery of a major judgment, with a brief summary of it (normally not more than one page).

The family also includes the [[ambrosia beetle]]s, of which the present-day subfamily [[Platypodinae]] was formerly considered the distinct family Platypodidae.\n\n==Description==\nThey are recognized by their distinctive long snouts and [[Insect morphology#Antennae|geniculate]] antennae with small clubs; beyond that, curculionids have considerable diversity of form and size, with adult lengths ranging from {{convert|1|to|40|mm|2|abbr=on}}.\n[[File:Curculionidae . Curculio elephas (33105941022).jpg|thumb|''Curculio elephas'']]\nWeevils are almost entirely plant feeders, and most species are associated with a narrow range of hosts, in many cases only living on a single species. With so many species to classify and over 400 genera, the taxonomy of this family is quite complicated, and authors disagree on the number and placement of various subfamilies, tribes, and subtribes.\n\n==Phylogeny and systematics==\nThe [[phylogeny]] of the group is complex; with so many species, a spirited debate exists about the relationships between subfamilies and genera.  A 1997 analysis attempted to construct a phylogeny based mainly on larval characteristics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adriana E.

The various proposed [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] schemes typically  recognize as many additional subfamilies again, but little agreement is seen between authorities about which.

The family also includes the [[ambrosia beetle]]s, of which the present-day subfamily [[Platypodinae]] was formerly considered the distinct family Platypodidae.\n\n==Description==\nThey are recognized by their distinctive long snouts and [[Insect morphology#Antennae|geniculate]] antennae with small clubs; beyond that, curculionids have considerable diversity of form and size, with adult lengths ranging from {{convert|1|to|40|mm|2|abbr=on}}.\n[[File:Curculionidae . Curculio elephas (33105941022).jpg|thumb|''Curculio elephas'']]\nWeevils are almost entirely plant feeders, and most species are associated with a narrow range of hosts, in many cases only living on a single species. With so many species to classify and over 400 genera, the taxonomy of this family is quite complicated, and authors disagree on the number and placement of various subfamilies, tribes, and subtribes.\n\n==Phylogeny and systematics==\nThe [[phylogeny]] of the group is complex; with so many species, a spirited debate exists about the relationships between subfamilies and genera.  A 1997 analysis attempted to construct a phylogeny based mainly on larval characteristics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adriana E.

Others, however, recognize a lesser number &ndash; the only subfamilies that are almost universally considered valid are the [[Baridinae]], [[Cossoninae]], [[Curculioninae]], [[Cyclominae]], [[Entiminae]], [[Molytinae]], [[Platypodinae]], and [[Scolytinae]].  The various proposed [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] schemes typically  recognize as many additional subfamilies again, but little agreement is seen between authorities about which.
