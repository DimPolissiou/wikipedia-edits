However, it was reorganised in the 15th century, possibly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and the subsequent incorporation of the Ecumenical Patriarchate into the [[millet system]] of the Ottoman society. The first recorded metropolitan of that time was Joseph, in 1477. The following years the jurisdiction of the metropolis was extended to the east. During the late 17th century the see of the diocese was transferred to [[Kuzguncuk]] (Ermoulianai, Chrysokeramos), where it remained until 1855. At that period a number of monasteries were established, like the one of Saint Panteleemon, which was declared [[Stauropegic]].<ref name=Terezakis/>\n\nThe metropolitan of Chalcedon was one of the five Elder metropolitans from the wider region of Constantinople, the other being those of nearby [[Heraclea Perinthus|Herakleia]], [[Cyzicus]], Nicaea, and Nicomedia. Following an Ottoman decree of 1757 they had to be always present in the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and had direct access to the Ottoman [[Sultan]], to whom they announced the election of the new Ecumenical Patriarch.<ref name=Terezakis/>\n\nFrom the mid-19th century the local metropolis prospered thanks to the significant population increase and economic development of the local Orthodox population. In 1855 the see of the metropolitan returned to Chalcedon during the primateship of metropolitan Gerasimos. Moreover, the newly erected church of Saint Euphemia became the new cathedral. The metropolitan mansion was built near the cathedral in 1902.<ref name=Terezakis/>\n[[File:Sancte Euphemia Kad\u0131k\u00f6y.jpg|right|thumb|The small church of [[Euphemia|St Euphemia]] that serves as the cathedral of Chalcedon.]]\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1923, after the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] and the subsequent [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], all of the Greek Orthodox population in [[Anatolia]] had to move to [[Greece]], with the exception of the Asian outskirts of Constantinople. Thus, the metropolis of Chalcedon became the only active metropolis of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Anatolia, and one of the four in [[Turkey]].<ref name=Terezakis/> During the anti-Greek [[Istanbul Pogrom]] of September 1955, eleven churches under the jurisdiction of the Metropolis of Chalcedon were destroyed, while the remaining three church buildings were saved.

However, it was reorganised in the 15th century, possibly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and the subsequent incorporation of the Ecumenical Patriarchate into the [[millet system]] of the Ottoman society. The first recorded metropolitan of that time was Joseph, in 1477. The following years the jurisdiction of the metropolis was extended to the east. During the late 17th century the see of the diocese was transferred to [[Kuzguncuk]] (Ermoulianai, Chrysokeramos), where it remained until 1855. At that period a number of monasteries were established, like the one of Saint Panteleemon, which was declared [[Stauropegic]].<ref name=Terezakis/>\n\nThe metropolitan of Chalcedon was one of the five Elder metropolitans from the wider region of Constantinople, the other being those of nearby [[Heraclea Perinthus|Herakleia]], [[Cyzicus]], Nicaea, and Nicomedia. Following an Ottoman decree of 1757 they had to be always present in the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and had direct access to the Ottoman [[Sultan]], to whom they announced the election of the new Ecumenical Patriarch.<ref name=Terezakis/>\n\nFrom the mid-19th century the local metropolis prospered thanks to the significant population increase and economic development of the local Orthodox population. In 1855 the see of the metropolitan returned to Chalcedon during the primateship of metropolitan Gerasimos. Moreover, the newly erected church of Saint Euphemia became the new cathedral. The metropolitan mansion was built near the cathedral in 1902.<ref name=Terezakis/>\n[[File:Sancte Euphemia Kad\u0131k\u00f6y.jpg|right|thumb|The small church of [[Euphemia|St Euphemia]] that serves as the cathedral of Chalcedon.]]\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1923, after the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] and the subsequent [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], all of the Greek Orthodox population in [[Anatolia]] had to move to [[Greece]], with the exception of the Asian outskirts of Constantinople. Thus, the metropolis of Chalcedon became the only active metropolis of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Anatolia, and one of the four in [[Turkey]].<ref name=Terezakis/> During the anti-Greek [[Istanbul Pogrom]] of September 1955, eleven churches under the jurisdiction of the Metropolis of Chalcedon were destroyed, while the remaining three church buildings were saved.

[[Franz Liszt]] included an arrangement of this hymn in the sixth station, ''Saint Veronica'', of his ''[[Via crucis (Liszt)|Via crucis]]'' (Stations of the Cross), S. 504a. The Danish composer [[Rued Langgaard]] composed a set of variations for string quartet on this tune. It is also employed in the final chorus of \"Sinfonia Sacra\", the Ninth Symphony of the English composer [[Edmund Rubbra]]. [[Mauricio Kagel]] quoted the hymn at the end of his oratorio ''[[Sankt-Bach-Passion]]'' telling [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] life, composed for the tricentenary of Bach's birth in 1985.\n\nThe melody of \"[[American Tune]]\" by [[Paul Simon]] is based on the hymn. \"Stop Error\" on [[Provincial (album)|Provincial]] by [[John K Samson]] also uses the same melody.
