All three had teeth, though in ''Yixianornis'' the tips of the jaws were toothless and pockmarked with small pits and grooves, possibly indicating the presence of a beak. The teeth were small and peg-like, and lacked any serrations. The lower jaw was thin and delicate.<ref name=clarke2006/>\n\nThe breastbone bore a strong keel for the attachment of flight muscles, and contained a distinct opening or fenestra, a unique characteristic of yanornithiformes. The upper and lower arm were about the same length. Like other ornithurines, ''Yixianornis'' had a highly fused hand, with many wrist bones joined together that are free in more primitive birds.<ref name=clarke2006/>\n\nThe hips and hind limbs preserved more primitive features than the forelimbs, supporting the idea that the modern adaptations in the locomotion seen in modern birds evolved after the many specializations needed for flight. The ''hallux'', or reversed, perching toe of modern birds, in noticeably pointed backward in the fossil. However, there is no clear evidence that the bone itself was twisted, which would indicate that the toe was permanently reversed.<ref name=clarke2006/>\n\n''Yixianornis'' differed from related birds only in small skeletal characteristics. For example, the teeth in the lower jaw of ''Yixianornis'' were confined to a smaller space, while they lined more of the jaw in related species. The wishbone (''furcula'') of ''Yixianornis'' was more narrow than in its relatives, and its shoulder blade was much shorter, only half the length of the upper arm bone (''humerus'').<ref name=clarke2006/>\n\nThe flight feathers of ''Yixianornis'' are well preserved in the only known specimen. There were about five [[primary feather]]s on each wing, the longest measuring about {{convert|6.7|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Unlike in many more basal species, the feathers did not become narrower or more pointed at the tip. Rather, the feathers were very broad and rounded. There were eight tail feathers, up to {{convert|9.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, anchored to a [[pygostyle]] and ''rectrical bulb'' (see below) as in modern birds.<ref name=clarke2006/>\n\n==Biology and ecology==\nThe feathers of ''Yixianornis'' are unique among those preserved in other Mesozoic bird specimens, and have allowed scientists to infer its probable lifestyle. The wings were broad and rounded, with similarly large, rounded feathers. The tail feathers were arranged in a graduated series, with the outer feathers anchored closer to the base of the tail. This would have given the tail a slightly rounded silhouette. Additionally, carbonized tissue impressions show that it had a ''rectrical bulb'', the muscles around the tail which allow the tail feathers to be fanned out during flight, and retraced when at rest.<ref name=clarke2006/>\n\nThese adaptations are rare among Mesozoic birds, many of which are known to have had long, pointed wings and very few, if any, long tail feathers.
