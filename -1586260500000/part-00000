It would also serve to moor the coordinates of the  augmented content to the three dimensional location, orientation and scale of the open book, helping to create a stable and accurate fusion of real and synthetic imagery.\n\nA slightly more complex example would be multiple fiducials, each attached to an individual piece in an augmented reality [[board game]].\n\n=== Metrology ===\nThe appearance of markers in images may act as a reference for [[image scaling]], or may allow the image and physical object, or multiple independent images, to be [[correlated]].

In [[neuronavigation]], a \"fiducial spatial coordinate system\" is used as a reference, for use in neurosurgery, to describe the position of specific structures within the head or elsewhere in the body. Such fiducial points or landmarks are often created in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[computed tomography]] images by using the [[N-localizer]].\n\n===Printed circuit boards===\n[[File:Cirrus Logic CL-GD5446 136309016 crop fiduciary.png|thumb|Fiducial marker for a chip to the right and the whole PCB beneath]]\nIn [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) manufacturing, fiducial marks, also known as circuit pattern recognition marks, allow [[SMT placement equipment]] to accurately locate and place parts on boards. These devices locate the circuit pattern by providing common measurable points. They are usually made by leaving a circular area of the board bare from [[solder-mask coating]]. Inside this area is a circle exposing the copper plating beneath. This center metallic disc can be solder-coated, gold-plated or otherwise treated, although bare copper is most common if not a current-carrying contact. Alternatively, it is possible to use clear solder-mask lacquer to cover the fiducials. In order to minimize [[rounding error]]s it was good practice to place fiducials in the same grid (or some multiple of it) that was used to place the parts, however, this isn't always possible on high-density boards nor is it a requirement any more with modern high-precision machines.\n\n[[File:Round fiducial on pcb.jpg|thumb|A gold-plated circular fiducial marker]]\n\nMost placement machines are fed boards for assembly by a rail [[Conveyor system|conveyor]], with the board being clamped down in the assembly area of the machine. Each board will clamp slightly differently than the others, and the variance\u2014which will generally be only tenths of a millimeter\u2014is sufficient to ruin a board without proper calibration. Consequently, a typical PCB will have multiple fiducials to allow placement robots to precisely determine the board's orientation. By measuring the location of the fiducials relative to the board plan stored in the machine's memory, the machine can reliably compute the degree to which parts must be moved relative to the plan, called ''offset'', to ensure accurate placement.\n\nUsing three fiducials enables the machine to determine PCB offset in both the X and Y axes, as well as to determine if the board has rotated during clamping, allowing the machine to rotate parts to be placed to match. Such fiducials are also called global fiducials.\nGlobal fiducials are also used in conjunction with [[stencil printing]]. Without them the printer would not print the solder paste in exact alignment with the pads. \nParts requiring a very high degree of placement precision, such as [[ball grid array]] packages, may have additional local fiducials near the package placement area of the board to further fine-tune the targeting. Local fiducial, however, cannot be used in the stencil printing process.\n\nConversely, low end, low-precision boards may only have two fiducials, or use fiducials applied as part of the screen printing process applied to most circuit boards. Some very low-end boards may use the plated mounting screw holes as ersatz fiducials, although this yields very low accuracy.\n\nFor prototyping and small batch production runs, the use of a fiducial camera can greatly improve the process of board fabrication. By automatically locating fiducial markers, the camera automates board alignment. This helps with front to back and multilayer applications, eliminating the need for set pins.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tVZ-sdxG2o</ref>\n\n===Printing===\nIn [[color printing]], fiducials\u2014also called \"[[registration black]]\"\u2014are used at the edge of the cyan, magenta, yellow and black ([[CMYK color model|CMYK]]) printing plates so that they can be correctly aligned with each other.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Secchi disk]]\n* [[Landmark point]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Images with rulers to indicate scale}}\n{{Commons category|Images with coins to indicate scale}}\n\n[[Category:Medical imaging]]\n[[Category:Image processing]]\n[[Category:Computer graphics]]\n[[Category:3D computer graphics]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=July 2016}}\n[[File:Passionfruit comparison.jpg|thumb|A [[ruler]] used as a fiducial marker]]\nA '''fiducial marker''' or '''fiducial''' is an object placed in the [[field of view]] of an [[imaging system]] which appears in the image produced, for use as a point of reference or a measure.

Some very low-end boards may use the plated mounting screw holes as ersatz fiducials, although this yields very low accuracy.\n\nFor prototyping and small batch production runs, the use of a fiducial camera can greatly improve the process of board fabrication. By automatically locating fiducial markers, the camera automates board alignment. This helps with front to back and multilayer applications, eliminating the need for set pins.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tVZ-sdxG2o</ref>\n\n===Printing===\nIn [[color printing]], fiducials\u2014also called \"[[registration black]]\"\u2014are used at the edge of the cyan, magenta, yellow and black ([[CMYK color model|CMYK]]) printing plates so that they can be correctly aligned with each other.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Secchi disk]]\n* [[Landmark point]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Images with rulers to indicate scale}}\n{{Commons category|Images with coins to indicate scale}}\n\n[[Category:Medical imaging]]\n[[Category:Image processing]]\n[[Category:Computer graphics]]\n[[Category:3D computer graphics]]\n", "name_user": "Tomahawk Tasmania", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSocial insect tracking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_marker"}

[[Universal Pictures]] released the film on August 22, 1997.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens with a bakery truck driving down the street, and Beaver and Wally riding together on Wally's bicycle, delivering morning newspapers. Beaver tosses the newspapers wildly into the air with both hands: one of them plops into a wet cement, another one lands on a roof and another roof, one into a dog's mouth, one into a birdbath, one onto a cat, one into a man's leaf-vacuum nozzle, and one lands smack on a painter's head. Then the leaf vacuum explodes and throws dirt through the truck driver's window, causing him to slam on his brakes and have his sticky pies thrown about. Beaver and Wally apologize then ride away.\n\nBeaver has his heart set on a bicycle in a store window, but does not think his parents will buy it for him. Eddie Haskell tells him that if he flatters his father by signing up for football, he will get it on his birthday. Beaver joins the football team and endures the practices, despite his disadvantage of being smaller than his teammates. Beaver even goes so far as to refuse his father's reading him a bedtime story and kissing him goodnight. Beaver looks forward to his first football game. Ward is glad Beaver signed up for football, but the first game ends poorly when Beaver is tricked into passing the ball to a kid on the opposing team, whom Beaver remembered as a friend from summer camp. When Beaver celebrates his birthday, where guests eat cake and play spin the bottle, he is presented with the new bicycle, as well as a computer.\n\nOn the first day of school, five days later, Ward and June tell Wally to accompany Beaver for a few days while Beaver gets used to riding his bicycle to school. Beaver has a kind new teacher named Miss Landers. After school, Eddie asks Wally to come to the soda shop to see him flirt with Karen. Eddie does not want the Beaver to follow them, so Wally leaves him alone at the bike rack, telling him he will be back for him. Beaver is polishing his bike when a teenaged boy comes over and asks if he can show Beaver some cool bike tricks. Beaver agrees and the boy shows him some tricks before riding off with the bike. Inside the soda shop, Karen likes Wally and not Eddie. When Wally and Eddie come out of the shop and hear that Beaver's bike was stolen, they look for it, but cannot find it. During dinner that night, the boys try to cover up for the missing bike. When Ward finds out the truth, he is upset with the Beaver, but angrier at Wally because he was responsible for watching Beaver. In the boys' bedroom, they get into a fight, which sends Beaver's new computer flying out the window. Wally grabs the wire and tries to pull it in, but the wire breaks, and it crashes into pieces. This results in Ward completely losing all of his patience and grounding the boys.\n\nAfter the grounding, Beaver skips football practice and studies; and Wally spends time with Karen, who breaks up with him after reuniting with her ex-boyfriend, Kyle. Beaver goes into the city and gets hit by a truck, but is unharmed. Beaver encounters the youth who stole his bike. The youth, who is the younger brother of Kyle, challenges Beaver, as a way of getting his bike back, to climb up to a gigantic coffee mug atop the local cafe, which Beaver falls into and can't get out. The fire department and Ward help get him down, Ward realizing the Beaver may be under too much pressure. Ward had found out about Beaver skipping football practice and says Beaver can quit the team; but Beaver rejoins the team. During the last game, he catches the ball and scores a touchdown, while chasing after his stolen bike. At the Mayfield Festival, he again encounters the boy on the stolen bike and chases him. Kyle trips the Beaver to help his little brother escape, and Wally retaliates by pushing Kyle into a tub of fudge. Karen is also put off by Kyle's bullying and leaves him for Wally. Beaver uses a concession stand to block the boy's way, causing the boy to fly across a judges' table of pies set up to be judged and into an entire cart of them. Beaver gets his bike back. At home, Ward sees him polishing it; tells him that it would be safer if it stays in the house; and, at Beaver's request, reads a bedtime story to him.\ndeleted scene: beaver flying on a magic carpet.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Christopher McDonald]] as Ward Cleaver\n*[[Janine Turner]] as June Cleaver\n*[[Cameron Finley]] as Theodore \"Beaver/Beav\" Cleaver\n*[[Erik von Detten]] as Wallace 'Wally' Cleaver\n*[[Adam Zolotin]] as Eddie Haskell, Jr.\n*[[Erika Christensen]] as Karen L.

He is often accompanied by his dog \"[[K-9 (Looney Tunes)|K-9]]\", and sometimes by other creatures (one gag, first used in ''[[Hare-Way to the Stars]]'' (1958), being candy-sized \"Instant Martians\" that become full-size on addition of drops of water).\n\nMarvin wears a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldier's uniform, with basketball shoes. The style of these shoes resembles the [[Chuck Taylor All-Star]]s brand name, considered to be the \"generic\" or \"standard\" basketball sneaker. His head is a black sphere with only eyes for features. The curved crest of his helmet appears, with the [[broom|push-broom]]-like upper section, to comically resemble an ancient Greek [[hoplite]]'s or a Roman [[centurion]]'s helmet. The appearance of the combination of Marvin's head and helmet led to Bugs Bunny referring to him as a \"bowling ball wearing a [[spittoon]]\" in one short. Marvin speaks with a soft, nasally voice, and often speaks [[technobabble]]. The helmet and skirt that he wears are green and his suit is red (in a few of the original shorts, his suit was green).

They eventually befriend him upon seeing how helpful he is, and later sing songs including \"Oh Where Has My Martian Gone?\" (Based on the [[children's song]] [[Oh Where Has My Little Dog Gone?]]).\n* In ''Duck Dodgers'', he is a Martian commander in service of the Martian Queen Tyr'ahnee. This show reused his original name from ''The Hasty Hare'' (although the opening credits list him as Marvin playing Commander X-2, in the same way as Daffy is playing Duck Dodgers).\n* Marvin the Martian appears in ''The Looney Tunes Show'' episode \"Reunion\" and appeared in the \"Merrie Melodies\" short \"I'm a Martian\", voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]. Here, he is described as a former classmate of Daffy's who has been plotting to destroy Earth since graduation. The episode also has a flashback, in which it is revealed that the yellow headdress on the top of his helmet is actually his hair, showing that in high school (before he started wearing the helmet) he kept it down.\n\nOver a decade prior to any of these, he guest-starred in a ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' segment titled \"Duck Dodgers Jr.\", where he was accompanied by an apprentice named [[Marcia the Martian]].\n\nHe was also in a ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' episode \"The Man from M.A.R.S.\" and had a cameo appearance in ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'' (\"What's the Frequency, Kitty?\").\n\nMarvin also made appearances on ''[[Animaniacs]]'', notably in the [[Mindy and Buttons]] short subject, \"Cat on a Hot Steel Beam\" (which also featured the cute kitten [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot|Pussyfoot]]) and in \"Star Warners\", along with his dog K-9, and most recently in a [[MetLife]] commercial.\n\n[[Cartoon Network]] also created a 2-minute filler piece featuring Marvin, entitled \"Mars Forever\" by [[Fantastic Plastic Machine (musician)|Fantastic Plastic Machine]]. It's a disco-style video combining clips of Marvin and Bugs Bunny from their encounters in \"Haredevil Hare\", \"Hare-Way to the Stars\", as well as bits of \"Duck Dodgers in the 24th-and-a-half Century\" and \"Rocket-bye Baby\".\n\nMarvin has also appeared in a number of video games. He served as the main antagonist in the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] video games ''[[Taz in Escape from Mars]]'' and ''[[Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble]]'', the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] game ''[[Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions]]'', and the [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Looney Tunes Collector: Alert!]]''. He also appeared in ''[[Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time]]'' for the PlayStation where he was the boss of Dimension X, and in the final level of ''[[Sheep, Dog, 'n' Wolf]]''. He is also a recurring enemy in the Quantum Beep stages of ''[[Road Runner's Death Valley Rally]]'' for Super NES. He also was an enemy in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action (video game)|Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. He is also a playable character in ''[[Looney Tunes: Space Race]]'', ''[[Looney Tunes: Marvin Strikes Back!]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal]]''. He also made a brief cameo in the 2003\u20132007 [[Fridays (Cartoon Network)|CN Fridays]] intro.\n\nMarvin was also cast as the referee in ''[[Space Jam]]'' (though he did not stay to referee the whole game due to Bupkus beating him up), and then later had a major villainous role in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' where he was hired by the ACME chairman, [[Looney Tunes: Back in Action|Mr. Luther J. Chairman]] ([[Steve Martin]]), to finish DJ ([[Brendan Fraser]]) and the gang at Area 52. In the film's climax, he reappears to bring the Blue Monkey diamond to the ACME satellite, but is thwarted by Bugs (who he duels in a parody of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Jango Fett]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'') and Daffy (who arrives as [[Duck Dodgers]] to save Bugs after he is exhausted from the battle), resulting in Marvin trapped in a bubble floating through space.\n\nMarvin appeared in the Looney Tunes version of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', ''[[Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas]]'' as an employee at Daffy Duck's \"Lucky Duck Super Store\". Marvin was homesick for his planet, Mars, and wanted to go back for Christmas (but also mentions that he's planning to destroy the Earth as well). At first, Daffy doesn't let him take Christmas off, since he expects the employees to work on Christmas Day. After being visited by the abrasive yet well-intentioned Christmas ghosts, Daffy is redeemed, and as part of a surprise Christmas celebration, gives Marvin a rocket that will go faster than the speed of light, allowing him to make it to Mars by yesterday.\n\nMarvin is the main antagonist in ''[[Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run]]''.\n\nIn nearly all of his appearances, Marvin is shown using a small pistol that fires either bubbles of pliable plastic or energy beams, and he is seen in ''[[Duck Dodgers in the 24\u00bdth Century]]'', with [[Gossamer (Looney Tunes)|Gossamer]], a hairy red monster, as his assistant.\n\nMarvin's descendant Melvin (voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]]) appeared as a one-time antagonist in \u2018\u2019[[Loonatics Unleashed]]\u2019\u2019.\nHe also has the power to become invisible like the Yip-Yips-from-sesame-street.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Pop culture|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Nasa mer marvin.png|thumb|The launch patch for the [[Spirit (rover)|Spirit Mars Rover]], featuring Marvin the Martian.]]\n* Marvin's likeness appears in miniature on the ''[[Spirit rover|Spirit]]'' rover on Mars as well as on the mission launch patch.\n* Marvin appears in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[Imaginationland Episode III]]\". Here, he marches among myriad other evil fictional characters to battle against the surviving good characters along with an evil-eyed [[Gossamer (Looney Tunes)|Gossamer]] and a possibly rabid [[Wile E.

He also appears in the episode [[Love Is a Many-Splintered Thing]] where he was shown in a fighting video game.\n* He appeared in 1993 Nike commercial as the antagonist who had stolen all of the Earth's supply of [[Michael Jordan]] Air Jordan sneakers, and both Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan defeat him and his instant Martians to reclaim the shoes.\n* In a deleted scene on the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"[[That Darn Katz!]]\", Marvin is seen as a student in Mars University.\n* Marvin makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the feature film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', set in 1947, even though his first cartoon appearance was during the following year.\n* Marvin also makes a cameo appearance in episode 14 of the cartoon series ''[[Animaniacs]]'' when Buttons reaches the moon.\n* Marvin appears in a background shot during the movie ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', shown on a television in lead character Roy Neary's living room. The segment shown is from the feature cartoon, ''[[Duck Dodgers in the 24\u00bdth Century]]''.\n* The Illudium PU-36 explosive space modulator is referenced in several songs, including [[T-Pain]]'s \"Time Machine,\" as well as [[Ludacris]]'s \"Mouthing Off.\"\n* In the pilot episode of the TV series ''[[Weird Science (TV series)|Weird Science]]'', Lisa comments that she would have a lot more power had Wyatt installed a \"[[Neutronium|Neutronian]] space modulator\" before her creation.\n* [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Buffalo Sabres]] Goalie [[Patrick Lalime]]'s [[goaltender mask]] features Marvin the Martian on the front.\n* In the ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'' episode \"Star Warners\", Marvin was briefly shown on a date with [[Minerva Mink]]. K-9 is sleeping next to them.\n* Marvin briefly appears in [[Diane Duane]]'s 2010 novel ''[[A Wizard of Mars]]'', when one of the main characters gets caught in a spell that brings their stereotypes of Mars into existence.\n* According to [[Steven Spielberg]], he is waiting for [[George Lucas]] to admit that Marvin's design was the influence for [[Darth Vader]] from Lucas' ''[[Star Wars]]''.\n* Marvin appeared in a [[Mad (TV series)|MAD News]] segment, letting his sink run water on Mars.\n* [[Reach Records]] artist [[Derek Minor|PRo]] referenced Marvin the Martian and the space modulator in his song \"Mission to Mars\" from His 2011 album \"Dying to Live\".\n* In the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode \"Secrets,\" [[Miss Martian]] takes on the form of a gigantic Marvin the Martian to scare a teenager (coincidentally, also named [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Marvin]]) who is committing a ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|War of the Worlds]]''-style prank.\n* During the [[University of Southern California]]-[[Stanford University]] football game, the [[Drum major (marching band)|Drum Major]] of the visiting Stanford [[Marching band|Marching Band]] dressed as Marvin the Martian as a [[parody]] on the USC [[Spirit of Troy]] [[Trojan Marching Band]]'s Drum major.\n* In 2009 [[Bi-Mart]] Membership stores in Oregon sold [[University of Oregon]] vs. University of Southern California buttons featuring Marvin the Martian as the Trojan \"Mascot.\"\n* In a ''[[MetLife]]'' commercial that aired during the [[Super Bowl XLVI|2012 Super Bowl]], Marvin made a cameo in the ad.\n* In Peter David's 1991 ''[[Star Trek]]'' novel ''The Rift'', the Calligarians have a device called \"The Illidium Pew-36 Explosive Space Modulator,\" a direct reference to Marvin's Earth-shattering device.\n* A figurine of Marvin appears on the space shuttle in the film ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]''.\n* Marvin appears in the 1995 film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' when Travis tells Tai that he wants to cover his skateboard with pictures of Marvin, and she says she can draw him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subzin.com/quotes/Clueless/I+can+do+Marvin+the+Martian|title=I can do Marvin the Martian - Clueless quotes|website=Subzin.com|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Phish]] guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]] frequently wore a Marvin the Martian T-shirt onstage between 1993 and 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://welcometonow.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/lag930529-01-cp.jpg|format=PJPG|title=Photographic image|website=Welcometonow.files.wordpress.com|accessdate=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n* Marvin served as the mascot for the [[USCGC Hornbeam (WLB-394)]], a 180-foot [[United States Coast Guard]] [[buoy tender]].\n* Appeared in Steven Spielberg's 2018 film ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]''.<ref name=\"vulture-all-characters\">[http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/here-are-all-the-references-in-ready-player-one.html Here Are All the References In Ready Player One], By Abraham Riesman, Mar. 28, 2018, vulture.com</ref><ref name=\"azcentral-460466002\">[https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/movies/billgoodykoontz/2018/03/28/ready-player-one-movie-review-visually-stunning-emotionally-unfulfilling-steven-spielberg/460466002/ Steven Spielberg's 'Ready Player One' visually striking but emotionally unfulfilling], By Bill Goodykoontz, USA TODAY NETWORK Published:March 28, 2018</ref>\n\n* Marvin from Daddy Daycare (2003) frequently wears a Marvin Martian T-shirt\n\n==Film adaptation==\nOn July 29, 2008, [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Alcon Entertainment]] announced plans for a [[live action]]/[[computer animation|computer-animated]] film starring [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] as the voice of Marvin and [[Christopher Lee]] as [[Santa Claus]].

The episode also has a flashback, in which it is revealed that the yellow headdress on the top of his helmet is actually his hair, showing that in high school (before he started wearing the helmet) he kept it down.\n\nOver a decade prior to any of these, he guest-starred in a ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' segment titled \"Duck Dodgers Jr.\", where he was accompanied by an apprentice named [[Marcia the Martian]].\n\nHe was also in a ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' episode \"The Man from M.A.R.S.\" and had a cameo appearance in ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'' (\"What's the Frequency, Kitty?\").\n\nMarvin also made appearances on ''[[Animaniacs]]'', notably in the [[Mindy and Buttons]] short subject, \"Cat on a Hot Steel Beam\" (which also featured the cute kitten [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot|Pussyfoot]]) and in \"Star Warners\", along with his dog K-9, and most recently in a [[MetLife]] commercial.\n\n[[Cartoon Network]] also created a 2-minute filler piece featuring Marvin, entitled \"Mars Forever\" by [[Fantastic Plastic Machine (musician)|Fantastic Plastic Machine]]. It's a disco-style video combining clips of Marvin and Bugs Bunny from their encounters in \"Haredevil Hare\", \"Hare-Way to the Stars\", as well as bits of \"Duck Dodgers in the 24th-and-a-half Century\" and \"Rocket-bye Baby\".\n\nMarvin has also appeared in a number of video games. He served as the main antagonist in the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] video games ''[[Taz in Escape from Mars]]'' and ''[[Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble]]'', the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] game ''[[Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions]]'', and the [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Looney Tunes Collector: Alert!]]''. He also appeared in ''[[Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time]]'' for the PlayStation where he was the boss of Dimension X, and in the final level of ''[[Sheep, Dog, 'n' Wolf]]''. He is also a recurring enemy in the Quantum Beep stages of ''[[Road Runner's Death Valley Rally]]'' for Super NES. He also was an enemy in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action (video game)|Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. He is also a playable character in ''[[Looney Tunes: Space Race]]'', ''[[Looney Tunes: Marvin Strikes Back!]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal]]''. He also made a brief cameo in the 2003\u20132007 [[Fridays (Cartoon Network)|CN Fridays]] intro.\n\nMarvin was also cast as the referee in ''[[Space Jam]]'' (though he did not stay to referee the whole game due to Bupkus beating him up), and then later had a major villainous role in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' where he was hired by the ACME chairman, [[Looney Tunes: Back in Action|Mr. Luther J. Chairman]] ([[Steve Martin]]), to finish DJ ([[Brendan Fraser]]) and the gang at Area 52. In the film's climax, he reappears to bring the Blue Monkey diamond to the ACME satellite, but is thwarted by Bugs (who he duels in a parody of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Jango Fett]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'') and Daffy (who arrives as [[Duck Dodgers]] to save Bugs after he is exhausted from the battle), resulting in Marvin trapped in a bubble floating through space.\n\nMarvin appeared in the Looney Tunes version of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', ''[[Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas]]'' as an employee at Daffy Duck's \"Lucky Duck Super Store\". Marvin was homesick for his planet, Mars, and wanted to go back for Christmas (but also mentions that he's planning to destroy the Earth as well). At first, Daffy doesn't let him take Christmas off, since he expects the employees to work on Christmas Day. After being visited by the abrasive yet well-intentioned Christmas ghosts, Daffy is redeemed, and as part of a surprise Christmas celebration, gives Marvin a rocket that will go faster than the speed of light, allowing him to make it to Mars by yesterday.\n\nMarvin is the main antagonist in ''[[Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run]]''.\n\nIn nearly all of his appearances, Marvin is shown using a small pistol that fires either bubbles of pliable plastic or energy beams, and he is seen in ''[[Duck Dodgers in the 24\u00bdth Century]]'', with [[Gossamer (Looney Tunes)|Gossamer]], a hairy red monster, as his assistant.\n\nMarvin's descendant Melvin (voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]]) appeared as a one-time antagonist in \u2018\u2019[[Loonatics Unleashed]]\u2019\u2019.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Pop culture|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Nasa mer marvin.png|thumb|The launch patch for the [[Spirit (rover)|Spirit Mars Rover]], featuring Marvin the Martian.]]\n* Marvin's likeness appears in miniature on the ''[[Spirit rover|Spirit]]'' rover on Mars as well as on the mission launch patch.\n* Marvin appears in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[Imaginationland Episode III]]\". Here, he marches among myriad other evil fictional characters to battle against the surviving good characters along with an evil-eyed [[Gossamer (Looney Tunes)|Gossamer]] and a possibly rabid [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]]. \n* Marvin appears in two ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episodes: \"[[Charlotte's Web of Lies]]\", where he is seen in [[List of Drawn Together characters#Ling-Ling|Ling-Ling]]'s Anger Management group with [[Hulk]], [[Skeletor]], and [[Yosemite Sam]]; and \"[[Toot Goes Bollywood]]\".\n* He appears in the FBI lineup with other TV aliens in \"[[The Springfield Files]]\", an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', wearing a purple helmet and skirt. He also appears in the episode [[Love Is a Many-Splintered Thing]] where he was shown in a fighting video game.\n* He appeared in 1993 Nike commercial as the antagonist who had stolen all of the Earth's supply of [[Michael Jordan]] Air Jordan sneakers, and both Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan defeat him and his instant Martians to reclaim the shoes.\n* In a deleted scene on the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"[[That Darn Katz!]]\", Marvin is seen as a student in Mars University.\n* Marvin makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the feature film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', set in 1947, even though his first cartoon appearance was during the following year.\n* Marvin also makes a cameo appearance in episode 14 of the cartoon series ''[[Animaniacs]]'' when Buttons reaches the moon.\n* Marvin appears in a background shot during the movie ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', shown on a television in lead character Roy Neary's living room.
